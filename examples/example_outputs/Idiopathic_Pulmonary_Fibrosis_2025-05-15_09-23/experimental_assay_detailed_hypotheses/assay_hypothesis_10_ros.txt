Assay Overview:
The proposed assay involves applying cyclic mechanical stretch to alveolar epithelial cells in culture while monitoring real‐time production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through live‐cell fluorescent probes. This experimental setup models one of the early stimuli in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) – namely, the mechanical stress experienced by lung epithelium during respiration, which triggers oxidative stress and initiates fibrotic signaling cascades. The assay will involve quantifying ROS kinetics using high‐throughput imaging systems, whereby candidate therapeutic compounds (for example, antioxidants or agents modulating redox‐sensitive pathways) can be evaluated for their capacity to dampen stretch‐induced ROS generation. The biological material typically comprises primary or immortalized alveolar epithelial cells (such as AEC2 cells), which are highly relevant to the pathology of IPF (kosunen2024epithelialcellsin pages 26-29, moreira2022advancedinvitro pages 28-30).

Biomedical Evidence:
Oxidative stress is a well‐recognized contributor to the pathogenesis of IPF, where excessive ROS production leads to mitochondrial damage, epithelial cell injury, and ultimately, fibroblast activation and collagen deposition. Among the cellular processes implicated in fibrosis, the production of ROS upon mechanical stress is directly relevant to alveolar injury seen in patients with IPF. As multiple in vitro and ex vivo studies have indicated, cyclic mechanical stretch mimics the biomechanical forces encountered during normal breathing and in diseased lungs where tissue stiffening occurs (kosunen2024epithelialcellsin pages 29-33, lehmann2018differentialeffectsof pages 1-2). Clinical evidence also supports the role of oxidative stress, as demonstrated by elevated biomarkers of ROS and improved patient outcomes with antioxidant treatments (NCT00512967, NCT03865927). Thus, interrogating redox dynamics under physiologically relevant mechanical conditions offers crucial mechanistic insight into disease progression and therapeutic response.

Previous Use:
While direct validation of ROS imaging under stretch in alveolar epithelial cells for drug discovery is still emerging, several studies have provided indirect support for this approach. Advanced in vitro models such as lung organoids, precision-cut lung slices, and lung-on-a-chip systems have been employed to recapitulate mechanical stretch and measure cellular responses in IPF (kosunen2024epithelialcellsin pages 33-35, vazquezarmendariz20223dinvitro pages 6-8). In some of these models, ROS imaging has been utilized to assess the oxidative state of cells under mechanical and chemical stress, serving as a readout for the efficacy of candidate compounds. Additionally, the integration of cyclic mechanical forces in 3D microtissue models has already demonstrated the utility of simulating physiological conditions for the evaluation of anti-fibrotic agents (asmani2019cyclicstretchingof pages 1-2). Together, these findings underline that, although not yet completely standardized, the method shows promise as a platform for early-stage drug discovery in IPF.

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of the assay include its physiological relevance through the replication of lung mechanical forces and the direct measurement of a key pathological marker—ROS production. This allows for the dynamic and high-throughput screening of drug candidates aimed at modulating oxidative stress, which is central to IPF pathogenesis. However, weaknesses exist due to the reductionist nature of in vitro models that primarily focus on epithelial cells in isolation rather than the complex interplay with fibroblasts, immune cells, and extracellular matrix components present in vivo (kosunen2024epithelialcellsin pages 33-35, lehmann2018differentialeffectsof pages 1-2). Additionally, variability in stretch protocols and the specificity and sensitivity of live-cell ROS probes can affect reproducibility. Thus, while ROS imaging under stretch presents a valuable early-stage screening tool, data obtained from this assay should be further validated using more comprehensive models such as co-cultures, organoids, or in vivo studies to ensure translatability (kosunen2024epithelialcellsin pages 26-29, vazquezarmendariz20223dinvitro pages 11-12).
