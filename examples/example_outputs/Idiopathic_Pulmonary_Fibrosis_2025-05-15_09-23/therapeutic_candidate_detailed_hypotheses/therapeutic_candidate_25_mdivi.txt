Proposal for Mdivi-1 (Drp1 Inhibitor, Selleckchem S8439)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Mdivi-1 is a synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor that was discovered through high‐throughput chemical screening efforts designed to modulate mitochondrial dynamics. As a quinazolinone derivative, Mdivi-1 specifically targets dynamin‐related protein 1 (Drp1), which is a key regulator of mitochondrial fission. Drp1 is a cytosolic GTPase that, upon activation, translocates to the mitochondrial outer membrane to mediate fission through oligomerization and GTP hydrolysis. Mdivi-1 prevents the proper assembly and translocation of Drp1 thereby favoring a more fused mitochondrial network and stabilizing mitochondrial morphology. This therapeutic candidate belongs to the emerging class of mitochondrial fission inhibitors, which have drawn considerable attention in the last decade because of their potential to modulate mitochondrial structure and function in conditions in which abnormal fission contributes to pathology. In earlier preclinical studies, compounds in this class have been employed to ameliorate mitochondrial fragmentation in models of ischemia-reperfusion injury, neurodegenerative disorders, and conditions marked by aberrant proliferative responses such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (Tian et al., 2018; Duan et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
The initial uses of Mdivi-1 have been predominantly in the realm of preclinical research where it served as an indispensable tool for exploring the mechanistic roles of mitochondrial fission in cellular physiology and pathophysiology. In biochemical studies involving cardiac, neural, and vascular cells, Mdivi-1 has been employed to inhibit Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation and thereby prevent mitochondrial dysfunction, which is often evidenced by changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and alterations in cell metabolism. For example, in experimental models of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), treatment with Mdivi-1 resulted in reduced Drp1 activity in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, which led to decreased cellular hyperproliferation and collagen production—a process that mirrors some aspects of fibroblast activation in fibrotic diseases (Tian et al., 2018). Moreover, studies in models of paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis have provided evidence that targeting Drp1 with Mdivi-1 can reduce mitochondrial fragmentation and attenuate pro-inflammatory signaling cascades, such as those mediated by the TLR9-NF-κB pathway, indicating a robust antifibrotic effect in lung tissue (Unknown Reference). Furthermore, additional investigations in related lung injury models and evaluations in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) liver organoids have also underscored the relevance of mitochondrial dynamics modulation in reducing fibrotic gene expression and ECM deposition (Elbadawy et al., 2023). Although there is limited direct clinical evidence in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) models, the emerging trend in clinical trial searches for Drp1 inhibitors in fibrotic lung diseases reflects a growing consensus among researchers that modulating mitochondrial dynamics might offer translatable benefit in IPF (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, the process of mitochondrial fission is tightly regulated by Drp1. In its inactive state, Drp1 resides in the cytosol. However, upon receiving activation signals—including phosphorylation events such as at serine 616 (p-Drp1^S616)—Drp1 is recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane where it interacts with receptor proteins and oligomerizes to physically constrict and divide mitochondria. Elevated lactate levels in pulmonary fibroblasts can stimulate the ERK1/2 pathway, which then phosphorylates Drp1 at serine 616, promoting the excessive mitochondrial fission observed in fibrotic conditions (Sun et al., 2024). Mdivi-1 acts by interfering with the oligomerization step of Drp1, thereby preventing its effective binding to the mitochondrial membrane and the subsequent fission event. This inhibition not only stabilizes mitochondrial morphology, fostering an elongated, interconnected network, but also restores proper mitochondrial function by reducing aberrant ROS generation that typically results from fragmented mitochondria (Sun et al., 2024). In addition, the normalization of mitochondrial dynamics by Mdivi-1 has been linked to an improved balance in cellular bioenergetics; specifically, a reduction in the Warburg-like glycolytic reprogramming that is often observed in pathological fibroblasts (Tian et al., 2018). By enhancing electron transport chain efficiency and reducing mitochondrial ROS, Mdivi-1 indirectly dampens the activation of pro-fibrotic mediators such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). Elevated ROS levels are well-known activators of the NF-κB signaling cascade, particularly the p65 subunit, which can lead to increased expression of fibrotic markers including α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen I (COL1A1) (Lin et al., 2024). Thus, Mdivi-1’s mechanism of restoring mitochondrial integrity reaches beyond a mere morphological effect; it also modulates key signaling pathways that underpin fibroblast activation, collagen synthesis, and contractility.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis that Mdivi-1 will ameliorate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is built on the expectation that targeting mitochondrial fission will lead to normalization of fibroblast mitochondrial dynamics, reduction in oxidative stress, and consequent dampening of downstream pro-fibrotic signaling cascades. In a 3D collagen gel contraction assay using lung fibroblasts derived from IPF patients, the expected effect is multifold. First, by inhibiting Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission, Mdivi-1 should restore an elongated mitochondrial network. This morphological normalization is anticipated to result in decreased production of mitochondrial ROS, which are implicated in the persistent activation of TGF-β signaling—a central mediator of fibrosis (Sun et al., 2024). As fibroblasts in the IPF lung typically exhibit a metabolic shift towards glycolysis along with increased ROS, the re-establishment of proper mitochondrial morphology is expected to shift cellular metabolism back towards oxidative phosphorylation, thereby attenuating the hyperproliferative and synthetic state of these cells (Tian et al., 2018).

Second, the reduction in ROS production should lead to a significant decrease in the activation of TGF-β. TGF-β is a critical cytokine involved in the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which express high levels of contractile proteins such as α-SMA and are responsible for the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins like collagen. By lowering ROS levels, Mdivi-1 is expected to blunt TGF-β activation and thereby reduce the expression of α-SMA and collagen I, resulting in a measurable reduction in gel contraction in 3D collagen assays (Guo et al., 2023; Unknown Reference).

Furthermore, the normalization of mitochondrial dynamics may also directly influence fibroblast contractility. Abnormal mitochondrial fission and ROS production are known to enhance fibroblast contractility, contributing to the pathological stiffening of lung tissue that is a hallmark of IPF. Therefore, treatment with Mdivi-1 is projected to result in diminished fibroblast contractility, as evidenced by a reduction in the degree of collagen gel contraction. On a molecular level, this effect is likely to correlate with reduced levels of pro-fibrotic markers, improved mitochondrial respiration, and a more normalized cellular phenotype that is less supportive of the autocrine loops that fuel fibrosis (Li et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
The comprehensive evaluation of Mdivi-1 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) reveals both promising strengths and significant considerations that must be addressed in the translation process. On the strengths side, Mdivi-1 offers a unique mechanism of action that directly targets dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics—a fundamental aspect of the pathogenesis of fibrotic lung diseases. The ability of Mdivi-1 to inhibit Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission addresses a primary defect in IPF fibroblasts, restoring an elongated and interconnected mitochondrial network. This restoration is essential for reducing mitochondrial ROS production, thereby dampening the TGF-β-driven signaling cascades that promote myofibroblast differentiation, collagen deposition, and tissue stiffening (Sun et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2018). Preclinical data from models of PAH and paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis provide robust biochemical evidence supporting the antifibrotic effects of Drp1 inhibition (Unknown Reference; Tian et al., 2018). Furthermore, ongoing clinical trial searches for agents targeting mitochondrial fission in lung fibrosis underscore the translational potential and growing interest in this therapeutic approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Elbadawy et al., 2023).

However, several weaknesses and challenges must be carefully considered. One of the principal concerns is the specificity of Mdivi-1 for Drp1. Evidence from studies in skeletal muscle and neuronal models indicates that while Mdivi-1 effectively inhibits mitochondrial fission at certain concentrations, at higher doses it can also inhibit components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (such as Complex I), leading to off-target effects that may compromise cellular bioenergetics (Rexius-Hall et al., 2020; Yeon et al., 2015). This raises potential safety concerns, particularly when considering long-term treatments in a chronic disease like IPF. The balance between pathological and physiological mitochondrial fission is delicate; while excessive fission is deleterious, a baseline level of fission is necessary for mitochondrial quality control and efficient mitophagy. Therefore, the therapeutic window for Mdivi-1 must be carefully defined to ensure that its antifibrotic benefits are achieved without impairing essential metabolic processes (Li et al., 2020).

Pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution represent additional challenges. Although preclinical studies have demonstrated effective doses in cellular and animal models, the bioavailability, half-life, and distribution of Mdivi-1 in lung tissue remain insufficiently characterized. This gap in knowledge could complicate dosing strategies for eventual clinical application in IPF. Moreover, the chronic nature of IPF requires that any therapeutic candidate not only exhibit acute antifibrotic effects but also maintain long-term safety and efficacy. Given the current limited data on the use of Mdivi-1 in chronic fibrosis models, further work is needed to validate its safety profile over extended treatment periods (Marx et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2023).

Another consideration is the complexity of the fibrotic microenvironment in IPF. While preclinical models such as those using fibroblasts in 3D collagen gels provide valuable insights into the cellular mechanisms driving fibrosis, the in vivo context in IPF is characterized by complex interactions among multiple cell types, persistent inflammatory stimuli, and dysregulated extracellular matrix remodeling. Combination therapies that include Mdivi-1 along with agents that target other pro-fibrotic pathways (for example, modulators of the TGF-β axis) may ultimately be necessary to achieve a clinically significant impact on disease progression (Zank et al., 2018; Mercader-Barceló et al., 2023).

Additionally, careful attention must be given to the dualistic role of mitochondrial fission. In some contexts, mitochondrial fission is required for cell division and the removal of damaged mitochondria; therefore, prolonged inhibition of Drp1 could theoretically result in the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, impaired cellular turnover, and unexpected adverse events. This is particularly relevant in lung tissue, where homeostasis depends on a delicate balance between cell proliferation, apoptosis, and regeneration in response to ongoing environmental insults (Luo et al., 2019).

Despite these potential hurdles, Mdivi-1 holds distinct promise thanks to its mechanistic targeting of mitochondrial dysfunction—a process that is increasingly recognized as central to the pathogenesis of IPF. By mitigating mitochondrial fragmentation and reducing oxidative stress, Mdivi-1 could feasibly interrupt the cascade of events leading to fibroblast activation, myofibroblast differentiation, and ultimately fibrotic remodeling. The net effect is anticipated to be a reduction in both the biochemical markers of fibrosis, such as TGF-β, α-SMA, and collagen deposition, as well as a measurable improvement in fibroblast contractility, as assessed through 3D collagen contraction assays (Guo et al., 2023; Unknown Reference).

The available preclinical data, particularly those obtained in settings of paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis and PAH-related vascular remodeling, offer a strong rationale for further investigation of Mdivi-1 in IPF-specific models. Future studies should focus on validating its efficacy in primary human lung fibroblasts derived from IPF patients as well as in animal models that recapitulate the chronicity and heterogeneity of the disease. Detailed pharmacokinetic analyses, as well as dosing and safety studies, will be imperative to establish Mdivi-1’s clinical viability. It may also be beneficial to explore combination therapies that pair Mdivi-1 with currently approved antifibrotic agents to determine if synergistic effects can be achieved, potentially lowering the required dose of either agent and minimizing adverse events (Burzangi, 2020; Tian et al., 2018).

Overall, the preclinical and mechanistic data suggest that Mdivi-1 offers a compelling and innovative approach to treating IPF by precisely targeting dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics, a key upstream driver of fibrogenesis. Its ability to restore mitochondrial network integrity, reduce ROS production, and consequently diminish TGF-β-induced fibroblast activation positions it as a strong candidate in the development pipeline for IPF therapeutics. Nonetheless, the issues related to drug specificity, optimal therapeutic window, and long-term safety must be comprehensively addressed through rigorous experimental validation before considering progression to clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rexius-Hall et al., 2020).

In conclusion, Mdivi-1 represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis owing to its unique mechanism of action that targets mitochondrial fission via Drp1 inhibition. The capacity of Mdivi-1 to normalize mitochondrial dynamics, reduce ROS production, shift cellular metabolism from a glycolytic phenotype back toward oxidative phosphorylation, and ultimately attenuate fibrotic signaling through reduced TGF-β activity and decreased fibroblast contractility is well-supported by a growing body of preclinical evidence (Sun et al., 2024; Unknown Reference). However, careful optimization of dosing strategies, assessment of potential off-target effects, and validation in IPF-relevant translational models remain critical steps. The dual role of mitochondrial fission in both physiological maintenance and pathological remodeling presents a complex challenge, one that necessitates a finely tuned therapeutic approach. Given the considerable unmet clinical need in IPF and the innovative nature of targeting mitochondrial dynamics, further preclinical research and eventual clinical evaluation of Mdivi-1 are warranted. With rigorous investigation, Mdivi-1 could potentially offer a novel therapeutic option that not only halts the progression of fibrosis but also improves lung function and patient outcomes in a disease that has thus far been refractory to many conventional therapies (Mercader-Barceló et al., 2023; Tian et al., 2018).
