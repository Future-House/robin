Proposal for GB0139 (TD139, Galectin-3 inhibitor, Galecto)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
GB0139 (also known as TD139) is a synthetic, inhaled small‐molecule inhibitor designed to selectively target galectin-3, a β-galactoside binding lectin that is critically implicated in fibrotic processes. It was discovered and optimized through a medicinal chemistry program at Galecto, by designing thiodigalactoside analogues with high nanomolar affinity for the carbohydrate recognition domain of galectin-3, which confers its potent inhibitory activity. This compound belongs to the class of galectin-3 inhibitors, a group of molecules that have been rationally designed to disrupt galectin-3 interactions on cell surfaces and within the extracellular milieu, and this class has previously been explored in both cancer and fibrotic disease contexts. Its inhaled mode of delivery, via a dry powder inhaler, is specifically tailored to achieve high local concentrations in the lung while minimizing systemic exposure, which is an important consideration for treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) given the localized nature of pulmonary fibrogenesis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Case Study: Development of GB0139 for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
GB0139 has undergone extensive preclinical evaluation and early‐phase clinical investigations in IPF, with phase I/IIa studies demonstrating its safety, tolerability, and evidence of target engagement in patients. Early clinical studies, such as those registered under NCT02257177 (Galecto Biotech AB, 2014) and NCT03832946 (Galecto Biotech AB, 2019), evaluated GB0139’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in both healthy volunteers and IPF patients, establishing that inhaled GB0139 achieves significant lung tissue exposure and reduces circulating levels of galectin-3 (Gaughan et al., 2021). Additionally, GB0139 has been assessed in contexts beyond IPF, such as COVID-19 pneumonitis, where its capacity to modulate inflammatory and fibrotic biomarkers has been demonstrated, further supporting its mechanistic rationale and smooth safety profile (Gaughan et al., 2021). Although its use in IPF has not yet led to regulatory approval, its advanced clinical evaluation underscores its potential repurposing and therapeutic value in fibrotic lung diseases (Hirani et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
Galectin-3 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of IPF by modulating several profibrotic pathways. It is upregulated in IPF lungs and acts to promote fibroblast activation, myofibroblast differentiation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition primarily through the potentiation of TGF-β signaling. GB0139 exerts its pharmacological effects by binding selectively to the carbohydrate recognition domain of galectin-3 with nanomolar affinity, thus inhibiting its interactions that drive the fibrogenic cascade. This inhibition has been shown to result in decreased expression of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and collagen I in IPF fibroblasts, markers that reflect reduced fibroblast activation and ECM production (Gaughan et al., 2021). Mechanistically, galectin-3 inhibition by GB0139 disrupts the autocrine and paracrine signaling loops that sustain TGF-β–mediated fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation, effectively dampening the feed-forward loop of fibrogenesis. Biochemically, by binding to galectin-3, GB0139 prevents galectin-3 from clustering with cell surface receptors and interacting with key signaling molecules involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, thereby reducing profibrotic cytokine release and altering macrophage phenotypes from a profibrotic to a more reparative profile (Hirani et al., 2021; Spagnolo et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assays, such as in 3D collagen gel systems, GB0139 is expected to reduce ECM deposition and contractility by attenuating fibroblast proliferation and activation. By blocking galectin-3, the compound should interrupt the TGF-β signaling cascade that is central to fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition, thereby reducing αSMA expression and collagen synthesis. Preclinical data indicate that treatment with GB0139 leads to dose-dependent decreases in galectin-3 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as well as plasma, correlating with reduced fibrotic biomarkers and diminished fibroblast proliferation (Hirani et al., 2021; Gaughan et al., 2021). Moreover, immunohistochemical analyses in earlier studies have demonstrated that galectin-3 is highly expressed in IPF lung tissue, particularly in fibroblasts and macrophages within fibrotic foci, thus establishing the target’s expression in the relevant cell types (Miah, 2022). The expected outcome is a restoration of normal fibroblast phenotype and decreased contractile tension in collagen matrices, which are indicative of reduced fibrogenic potential—a key mechanistic underpinning for reversing established fibrosis in IPF (Spagnolo et al., 2020; Molina-Molina, 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, GB0139 represents a promising therapeutic candidate for IPF owing to several strengths. Its high degree of selectivity for galectin-3 enables a specific interruption of fibrotic signaling pathways, notably TGF-β–mediated fibroblast activation and ECM deposition. The inhaled delivery system is an additional strength, providing direct lung targeting while limiting systemic exposure and reducing potential off-target effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Gaughan et al., 2021). Clinical trials to date have confirmed its safety and target engagement, as evidenced by reductions in pulmonary and circulating galectin-3 levels, as well as favorable biomarker profiles associated with diminished fibrosis (Galecto Biotech AB, 2019; Hirani et al., 2021).

However, some weaknesses remain. Although preclinical and early clinical data indicate a robust biochemical rationale, the true clinical efficacy in reversing established fibrosis in IPF remains to be definitively demonstrated in larger, long-term studies. There is also the challenge of balancing adequate drug exposure in the fibrotic lung tissue with potential safety concerns when combined with current standard-of-care therapies, as suggested by observations in some trials that noted dose-dependent adverse events when used alongside other treatments (Senior, 2022). Additionally, while the compound shows promising effects on TGF-β signaling and fibroblast proliferation in vitro, translating these anti-fibrotic effects into meaningful clinical improvement in lung function or survival in IPF patients is inherently challenging given the heterogeneity and advanced pathology seen in many patients.

In conclusion, the weight of the evidence supports further development of GB0139 as a therapeutic candidate for IPF. Its mechanism of action—selectively blocking galectin-3–mediated enhancement of TGF-β signaling and fibroblast proliferation—targets a central pathway in IPF pathogenesis. The favorable safety profile and demonstration of target engagement in early-phase trials are encouraging. Future studies will need to focus on confirming clinical efficacy, optimizing dosing regimens, and ensuring that the benefits are sustainable over the long term. Despite the challenges typical of antifibrotic therapies, GB0139’s molecular precision and targeted lung delivery provide a strong rationale for its continued evaluation as a disease-modifying intervention in IPF (Gaughan et al., 2021; Hirani et al., 2021; Spagnolo et al., 2020).
