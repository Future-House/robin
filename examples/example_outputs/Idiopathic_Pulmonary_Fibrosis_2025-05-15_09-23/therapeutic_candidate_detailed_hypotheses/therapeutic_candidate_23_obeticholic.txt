Proposal for Obeticholic Acid (OCA, Selleckchem S8140)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a semi‐synthetic bile acid derivative that functions as a potent and selective agonist of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). It was originally derived by modifying chenodeoxycholic acid to enhance its FXR activity by approximately 100‐fold relative to its natural counterpart, and it exhibits roughly 200‐fold higher potency for FXR over other bile acid receptors such as TGR5 (Comeglio et al., 2017). OCA belongs to the class of bile acid receptor agonists, compounds that have been primarily used in the management of cholestatic liver diseases, notably primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Its high potency, favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) and ADME profile, and well‐delineated safety record in liver indications have made it a cornerstone in hepatic anti‐fibrotic therapy. Its mechanism as an FXR agonist places it therapeutically in a class where modulation of bile acid homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory pathways are central to its clinical activity (Batiha et al., 2023; Comeglio et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
OCA has an established history in the clinical management of cholestatic liver diseases. It gained clinical use for PBC, particularly in patients who are intolerant or have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid, and has also been evaluated extensively in NASH where FXR agonism mediates antifibrotic, anti‐inflammatory, and metabolic regulatory outcomes (Manka et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2022). The drug’s ability to suppress fibrogenic pathways and reduce extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation in hepatic tissues is well documented in both preclinical and clinical settings. In preclinical studies using animal models of liver fibrosis, OCA demonstrated significant reductions in collagen deposition and fibrosis markers, improvements in portal hypertension, and favorable modulation of inflammatory cytokines (Comeglio et al., 2017; Manka et al., 2019). Though its current approved indications are primarily hepatic, its mechanism of action via FXR activation has prompted researchers to investigate its potential in other fibrotic conditions, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Several clinical trial registries have identified studies exploring FXR agonists in pulmonary fibrosis, even though definitive clinical data in IPF remain limited (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History in the Context of IPF and Similar Diseases:
While the bulk of the clinical evidence for OCA comes from its application in liver fibrosis and related metabolic diseases, the biological rationale for its repurposing in IPF stems from the observation that many fibrotic processes share common mediators. In both liver fibrosis and IPF, transforming growth factor‐beta 1 (TGF‐β1) plays an essential role as a profibrotic cytokine that drives fibroblast activation, myofibroblast differentiation, and ECM deposition. Preclinical models in hepatic fibrosis have shown that FXR agonism leads to downregulation of TGF‐β activity, reduced collagen synthesis, and improved tissue architecture. Similar cascades are implicated in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis, where proinflammatory and profibrotic signaling pathways converge on fibroblast activation, extracellular matrix production, and tissue remodeling (Chen et al., 2016; Cao et al., 2024). Although direct clinical trials in IPF patients are sparse, the potential use of OCA in lung fibrosis is supported by preclinical evidence demonstrating that FXR is expressed in lung cell types—including fibroblasts, alveolar epithelial cells, and endothelial cells—suggesting that modulating FXR activity may attenuate fibrotic pathways in these cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cao et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
OCA exerts its biological effects through potent activation of FXR, a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that plays a central role in regulating bile acid synthesis, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory responses. Upon binding OCA, FXR undergoes a conformational change enabling it to form a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). The FXR/RXR complex then binds to FXR response elements (FXREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. This activation cascade results in several downstream effects:

1. Downregulation of bile acid synthesis by inhibiting key enzymes such as CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 through induction of the small heterodimer partner (SHP) (Cao et al., 2024; Batiha et al., 2023).
2. Inhibition of pro‐inflammatory cytokines by suppressing nuclear factor kappa B (NF‐κB) signaling pathways, thereby reducing the secretion of molecules like TGF‐β1 (Chen et al., 2016; Cao et al., 2024).
3. Modulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling through regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs), critical regulators of collagen deposition and fibroblast contractility (Comeglio et al., 2017; Manka et al., 2019).
4. Enhancement of anti‐inflammatory mediators such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor alpha (PPARα) signaling, which further assists in the mitigation of inflammatory responses in both hepatic and potentially pulmonary tissues (Batiha et al., 2023; Comeglio et al., 2017).

In the context of IPF, the central hypothesis is that by activating FXR in lung fibroblasts and other lung parenchymal cells, OCA will suppress the secretion of TGF‐β1, a critical cytokine that drives the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. This myofibroblast phenotype is associated with increased contraction, excessive synthesis of ECM proteins such as collagen, and disruption of normal lung architecture. Therefore, through FXR-mediated mechanisms, OCA is expected to reduce fibroblast proliferation, ECM synthesis, and overall contractility within three-dimensional gel assays, mirroring the antifibrotic effects observed in hepatic systems (Cao et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2016; Comeglio et al., 2017).

Expected Effect:
Based on its established mechanism of FXR activation, OCA is expected to exert multiple beneficial effects in models of IPF. In vitro, it is hypothesized that OCA will modulate the behavior of lung fibroblasts in a three-dimensional culture, leading to several measurable outcomes:

• Suppression of TGF‐β1 secretion: TGF‐β1 is a central mediator in the feedback loop that drives fibroblast activation and transformation into myofibroblasts. By inhibiting TGF‐β1, OCA should theoretically attenuate the fibrogenic signaling cascade (Cao et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2016).
• Reduction in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis: The activation of fibroblasts triggers unchecked deposition of collagen and other ECM proteins, which stiffens lung tissue. FXR-mediated downregulation of ECM components through the inhibition of MMP/TIMP dysregulation is expected to normalize ECM turnover (Comeglio et al., 2017; Manka et al., 2019).
• Decreased contractility in 3D gel assays: The fibrotic phenotype is often characterized by increased contractility due to the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, indicated by elevated α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression. FXR activation by OCA is anticipated to result in reduced expression of α-SMA and lowered contractile function, thereby preserving lung compliance (庞昶 & 林树无, 2019).

In addition to these direct effects on fibroblast behavior, OCA is expected to exert anti‐inflammatory effects by inhibiting pro‐inflammatory cytokine networks within lung tissue—a mechanism that is believed to contribute to its beneficial effects in liver fibrosis and may similarly apply to IPF (Batiha et al., 2023; Cao et al., 2024). Expression of FXR has been confirmed in various lung cell types, including alveolar epithelial cells and possibly fibroblasts, which supports the idea that targeting this receptor can influence relevant cellular processes in the fibrotic microenvironment (Cao et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
Obeticholic acid exhibits several compelling features as a repurposed candidate for the treatment of IPF. Its strengths lie in its well-characterized mechanism of action as an FXR agonist, its established clinical use in liver fibrosis with a favorable safety and PK profile, and its potential to modulate critical fibrotic pathways such as TGF‐β1 signaling, ECM production, and cell contractility. The literature clearly outlines OCA’s ability to suppress inflammation and fibrosis in hepatic and vascular models, and while direct evidence in pulmonary fibrosis is not yet robust, the mechanistic parallels are promising (Comeglio et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2022).

However, there are also weaknesses and uncertainties. Direct clinical data testing OCA in patients with IPF are sparse, and while several preclinical studies support the antifibrotic effects of FXR agonism in liver models, the translation of these effects to lung tissues remains to be firmly established (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chen et al., 2016). Moreover, the dual nature of FXR signaling—where in some scenarios FXR activation could potentially have pro‐fibrotic effects—warrants careful evaluation in the specific context of lung fibroblast biology (Chen et al., 2016). Lastly, the complexity of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which involves multiple cell types and signaling pathways, suggests that monotherapy with an FXR agonist might be insufficient, and combination strategies may be needed.

In summary, OCA’s extensive clinical experience in hepatic fibrosis, combined with its clearly delineated FXR-mediated anti‐inflammatory and antifibrotic mechanisms, provides a strong rationale for further exploration in the treatment of IPF. Despite the current lack of direct clinical data in pulmonary fibrosis, the biochemical and preclinical evidence from related fibrotic conditions supports its evaluation in dedicated IPF models. The next steps should include comprehensive preclinical studies focused specifically on lung fibroblast responses, TGF‐β1 secretion, ECM synthesis, and functional assays of contractility in 3D lung tissue models, followed by well-designed early-phase clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy in IPF patients (Addissouky et al., 2024; Manka et al., 2019).
