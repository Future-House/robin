Proposal for Pexidartinib (CSF1R Inhibitor, PLX3397)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pexidartinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically targets the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), a critical regulator of macrophage survival, proliferation, and differentiation (Marques, 2024, pp. 124–127). It belongs to the class of CSF1R inhibitors, which are synthetic chemical compounds originally developed to modulate macrophage populations in diseases driven by aberrant macrophage activity. Pexidartinib, also known by its research identifier PLX3397, was initially discovered through high‐throughput screening efforts aimed at identifying small molecules capable of interfering with receptor tyrosine kinase signaling; its chemical synthesis and optimization led to an oral bioavailable drug candidate that has demonstrated potent activity against CSF1R (Shang et al., 2025, pp. 5–7). Drugs in this class have generally been used in oncology and other macrophage‐mediated pathologies, and their mechanism of action is centered on the inhibition of signaling pathways that support pro‐fibrotic and pro‐tumoral macrophage subsets (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This compound’s synthetic origin affords advantages in terms of manufacturing consistency, oral dosing, and rapid tissue penetration—features that have supported its clinical approval for tenosynovial giant cell tumor (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, pexidartinib has been explored and validated predominantly within the oncology setting, where it was approved for the treatment of tenosynovial giant cell tumor—a condition known to be driven by pathological macrophage proliferation mediated by CSF1R signaling (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Early-phase clinical trials in oncology demonstrated that pexidartinib could safely deplete tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and yield reductions in tumor volume, with pharmacodynamic markers indicating effective CSF1R blockade (Joshi et al., 2019, pp. 25–28). While its direct use in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) has not yet been established clinically, the extensive clinical data gathered from its use in tumor settings provides a strong translational framework for repurposing efforts. In the context of IPF and other fibrotic lung diseases, the role of CSF1R-expressing macrophages is well documented, and preclinical models have shown that macrophage depletion via CSF1R inhibition correlates with reduced fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition (Joshi et al., 2019, pp. 17–21; Guilliams & Svedberg, 2021, pp. 4–6). Additionally, several clinical trial searches (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) indicate significant ongoing interest in leveraging CSF1R inhibition for fibrotic conditions, thereby reinforcing pexidartinib’s potential for repurposing beyond oncology (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, pexidartinib exerts its therapeutic effects by binding to the ATP-binding pocket of the CSF1R tyrosine kinase, thereby preventing receptor autophosphorylation and subsequent downstream signaling cascades (Shang et al., 2025, pp. 5–7). This receptor blockade effectively disrupts the survival signals that are crucial for the maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation of both tissue-resident and monocyte-derived macrophages. In the lung, a subset of macrophages characterized by high CSF1R expression has been implicated in driving fibrotic pathology; these cells produce pro-fibrotic mediators such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) that subsequently activate fibroblasts and promote extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition (Joshi et al., 2019, pp. 21–25; Guilliams & Svedberg, 2021, pp. 3–4). The inhibition of CSF1R signaling by pexidartinib leads to a reduction in the number and/or functional reprogramming of these pro-fibrotic macrophages, thereby interfering with an autocrine or paracrine loop that sustains a fibrogenic microenvironment (Joshi et al., 2019, pp. 28–32; Shang et al., 2025, p. 8). Moreover, evidence from preclinical studies in various models suggests that CSF1R inhibition modulates the inflammatory milieu by favoring a shift from a pro-fibrotic M2-like macrophage phenotype toward a less fibrogenic state, although the precise reprogramming events at the transcriptomic level remain an active area of investigation (Han et al., 2023, pp. 10–11).

Expected Effect:
In the context of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, the hypothesis posits that pexidartinib will alleviate disease pathology by depleting or functionally regulating the CSF1R-positive, pro-fibrotic macrophage populations within lung tissue (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The reduction in these profibrotic macrophages is expected to result in lower local production of TGF-β and PDGF, two pivotal growth factors known to induce fibroblast proliferation, differentiation into myofibroblasts, and subsequent collagen and ECM deposition—a central tenet in the pathophysiology of IPF (Joshi et al., 2019, pp. 13–17; Guilliams & Svedberg, 2021, pp. 4–6). In vitro assays designed to measure 3D gel contraction, a proxy for fibroblast activation and ECM remodeling, should reflect attenuation when fibroblasts are co-cultured with lung macrophages that have been pre-treated with pexidartinib. This expected outcome is underpinned by extensive preclinical studies, which demonstrate that targeting the CSF1/CSF1R axis in animal models of lung fibrosis leads to decreased fibroblast-driven collagen deposition and improved lung architecture (Joshi et al., 2019, pp. 6–9; Laplagne et al., 2019, pp. 3–5). Additionally, biochemical assays are anticipated to show reduced gene expression of pro-fibrotic markers (e.g., TGF-β, PDGF, fibronectin) in lung tissue samples following treatment with pexidartinib, further supporting its role in modulating fibrogenic signaling pathways (Roy, 2017, pp. 284–286).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, pexidartinib presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis based on its well-defined mechanism of action and its potential to disrupt profibrotic macrophage-mediated signaling. One of the major strengths of this candidate is its established clinical safety profile in the treatment of tenosynovial giant cell tumor, which provides an important benchmark for its tolerability, as well as robust pharmacokinetic data demonstrating effective oral bioavailability (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Marques, 2024, pp. 124–127). Preclinical evidence strongly supports the notion that CSF1R inhibition can mitigate lung fibrosis by decreasing the recruitment and persistence of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages that are critical drivers of fibrotic processes in the lung (Joshi et al., 2019, pp. 17–21, 28–32). The proposed mechanism by which pexidartinib mediates its antifibrotic effects—namely by lowering the paracrine secretion of TGF-β and PDGF and subsequently reducing the activation of fibroblasts—directly addresses key pathological processes in IPF (Guilliams & Svedberg, 2021, pp. 4–6; Han et al., 2023, pp. 20–21).

Despite these strengths, certain weaknesses must be considered. First, while preclinical models provide compelling data, there remains a significant translational gap between animal models of lung fibrosis and human IPF, and it is critical to validate these findings in dedicated IPF clinical studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Second, potential adverse events, most notably hepatotoxicity and hematologic abnormalities, have been observed in oncology trials with pexidartinib and would require careful monitoring in patients with IPF, who may have concomitant comorbidities (Laplagne et al., 2019, pp. 22–24; Marques, 2024, pp. 45–48). Third, the heterogeneity of macrophage subsets in the lung—with tissue-resident alveolar macrophages frequently playing protective roles—raises concerns that a broad depletion strategy might impair essential immune functions and tissue homeostasis (Guilliams & Svedberg, 2021, pp. 1–2; Joshi et al., 2019, pp. 13–17). Thus, the clinical feasibility of pexidartinib in IPF will depend not only on its ability to deplete or reprogram the pathological, pro-fibrotic macrophage populations but also on its capacity to spare beneficial macrophages that are critical for normal lung function.

Furthermore, the specific impact of pexidartinib on downstream fibrogenic signaling pathways such as TGF-β and PDGF has not been extensively characterized in the context of pulmonary fibrosis; therefore, additional mechanistic studies are warranted to measure biomarker responses in lung tissue and correlate these with clinical endpoints such as forced vital capacity (FVC) and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) fibrosis scores (Joshi et al., 2019, pp. 21–25; Shang et al., 2025, p. 8). It is likely that combination strategies—where pexidartinib is administered alongside current anti-fibrotic agents such as nintedanib or pirfenidone—could potentiate its antifibrotic effects while allowing lower, potentially less toxic doses to be used (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

Another consideration is the need for a comprehensive evaluation of its pharmacodynamic effects on both biomarker endpoints and lung function over time. Early phase clinical trials designed specifically for a fibrotic endpoint will be crucial to determine whether pexidartinib can achieve sustained modulation of macrophages in the lung, reduce fibroblast activation, and ultimately slow or reverse the progression of fibrosis (Butowski et al., 2016, pp. 5–6; Joshi et al., 2019, pp. 32–36). The current literature also indicates a strong biological rationale based on in situ analyses and single-cell RNA sequencing studies that identify distinct profibrotic macrophage populations in fibrotic niches of the lung (Joshi et al., 2019, pp. 21–25; Guilliams & Svedberg, 2021, pp. 3–4).

In conclusion, pexidartinib’s established role in oncology as a potent and orally bioavailable CSF1R inhibitor, combined with robust preclinical evidence linking CSF1R-positive macrophages to fibrotic processes in the lung, supports its evaluation as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. Its mechanism of action—blocking the CSF1R-mediated signaling that sustains pathological macrophage populations—addresses the central pathophysiological drivers of IPF, namely the activation of fibroblasts through macrophage-secreted TGF-β and PDGF and the resultant ECM remodeling (Roy, 2017, pp. 284–286; Joshi et al., 2019, pp. 25–28). However, significant challenges such as ensuring selective targeting of pathogenic macrophage subsets, mitigating potential adverse effects, and bridging the translational gap from preclinical models to clinical efficacy must be solved prior to widespread adoption in IPF treatment protocols. Overall, while pexidartinib holds considerable promise based on its biochemical rationale, clinical safety record in other indications, and supportive experimental evidence, a cautious and well-structured clinical development plan with rigorous biomarker assessment will be essential to validate its efficacy in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Joshi et al., 2019, pp. 17–21).
