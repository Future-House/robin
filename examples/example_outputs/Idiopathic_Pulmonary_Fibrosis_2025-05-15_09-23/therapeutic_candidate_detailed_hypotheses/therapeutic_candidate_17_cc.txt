Proposal for CC-90001 (JNK Inhibitor, Celgene)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
CC-90001 is a small‐molecule, orally bioavailable inhibitor developed by Celgene (now under Bristol-Myers Squibb) that targets the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) family of serine/threonine kinases with a pronounced selectivity for the JNK1 and JNK2 isoforms (Luppi & Ferrara, 2024; Popmihajlov et al., 2022). Its synthesis arose through an iterative medicinal chemistry program aimed at optimizing selectivity for the ATP-binding pocket of JNK enzymes at nanomolar concentrations while reducing the hepatotoxicity and other adverse events observed with earlier compounds such as CC-930 (Fragni, 2022; Kolb et al., 2017). Belonging to the class of kinase inhibitors that have traditionally been deployed in oncology and inflammatory disorders, CC-90001 represents a second-generation candidate intended to perturb aberrant intracellular signaling driving fibrogenesis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Luppi & Ferrara, 2024). Its design exploits the structural features of the JNK kinase domain by incorporating chemical functionality that permits competitive binding within the ATP pocket; in doing so, it efficiently blocks critical phosphorylation events necessary for downstream signaling in both epithelial cells and fibroblasts implicated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

Therapeutic History:
The development history of CC-90001 is closely tied to the evolution of JNK inhibitors for fibrotic conditions, particularly IPF. Early clinical candidates, such as CC-930, laid foundational evidence by demonstrating that inhibition of JNK could lead to reductions in plasma biomarkers (for example, matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) and surfactant protein-D (SP-D)) and stabilization of forced vital capacity (FVC) in patients with IPF (Popmihajlov et al., 2022; van der Velden et al., 2016). Although CC-930 showed promising antifibrotic activity in preclinical bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis models with measurable reductions in collagen deposition and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), its clinical progression was hampered by dose-dependent liver enzyme elevations (Popmihajlov et al., 2022; van der Velden et al., 2016). These limitations spurred the rational optimization that culminated in CC-90001, a compound chemically refined to retain potent inhibition of JNK while improving its safety profile. CC-90001 has since advanced into Phase II clinical evaluation for both IPF and related progressive fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (PF-ILD), reinforcing its potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for these challenging conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Celgene, 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
At a molecular level, CC-90001 exerts its effects by binding competitively to the ATP-binding site on JNK1 and JNK2 isoforms, thereby inhibiting their kinase activity (Popmihajlov et al., 2022). Under normal physiological and pathologic conditions, JNKs phosphorylate the transcription factor c-Jun, which forms a component of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) complex; once activated, AP-1 promotes the transcription of a host of profibrotic genes involved in fibroblast proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation, and extracellular matrix production (Lin et al., 2018; Hou et al., 2021). In IPF, the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) remains a central driver of fibrogenesis, acting not only through canonical Smad-dependent pathways but also via non-SMAD signaling mechanisms such as those mediated by JNK (Kolb et al., 2017). By blocking the JNK pathway, CC-90001 effectively reduces the phosphorylation of c-Jun, thus interfering with the transactivation of genes that lead to fibroblast activation, overproduction of collagen type I, and the expression of α-SMA—markers indicative of myofibroblast differentiation (Popmihajlov et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2018). This inhibition translates into a dampened fibrotic response; preclinical studies in 3D collagen matrices have shown that JNK inhibitors can reduce fibroblast contractility, a phenotype central to the pathophysiology of fibrotic tissue remodeling in IPF (Hou et al., 2021). Furthermore, evidence from both human lung tissue and relevant animal models indicates that JNK activity is elevated in the pathologic milieu of IPF, highlighting the effectiveness of CC-90001 in targeting a central node of the disease process (van der Velden et al., 2020; Popmihajlov et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for employing CC-90001 in IPF is that inhibition of JNK-mediated non-SMAD TGF-β signaling will have multiple beneficial impacts on the cellular and molecular pathology of the disease. In cell-based assays employing primary human lung fibroblasts or airway epithelial cells—which are known to robustly express TGF-β and its receptors—the drug is anticipated to lower the phosphorylation levels of c-Jun; this should lead to a downstream reduction in the expression of profibrotic markers such as α-SMA and collagen type I (Lin et al., 2018; Popmihajlov et al., 2022). In three-dimensional collagen gel contraction assays, which recapitulate the in vivo microenvironment of fibrotic lung tissue, treatment with CC-90001 is expected to diminish fibroblast proliferation and contractility, thereby reducing the formation of a contractile myofibroblast phenotype that characterizes progressive fibrosis (Popmihajlov et al., 2022; van der Velden et al., 2016). Additionally, by interfering with the propagation of profibrotic signals, CC-90001 would be expected to stabilize or improve lung function parameters such as FVC, as observed in prior clinical investigations with related compounds (Popmihajlov et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The anticipated reduction in fibrotic biomarkers, including extracellular matrix proteins and cytokines such as MMP-7 and tenascin-C, would offer supportive evidence for the antifibrotic activity of the drug, which in turn could slow or even partially reverse the fibrotic remodeling in the lung (van der Velden et al., 2020; Popmihajlov et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
CC-90001 emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, buoyed by a strong biochemical rationale and supported by a combination of preclinical and early clinical data. One of the primary strengths of this candidate lies in its high selectivity and potent inhibition of the JNK1 and JNK2 enzymes at nanomolar concentrations, which directly disrupts a critical non-SMAD signaling pathway that underpins TGF-β-induced fibrogenesis (Kolb et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018). Preclinical studies have repeatedly shown that blockade of JNK activity results in decreased phosphorylation of c-Jun, leading to reduced fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation—key pathological events in IPF (Popmihajlov et al., 2022; Hou et al., 2021). Moreover, the transition from earlier generation compounds such as CC-930 to CC-90001 highlights an iterative improvement meant to alleviate safety concerns, particularly hepatotoxicity, while retaining antifibrotic efficacy (Fragni, 2022; van der Velden et al., 2016).

The expected downstream effects of CC-90001 are multifaceted. Its ability to decrease c-Jun phosphorylation disrupts a cascade of transcriptional events that contribute to extracellular matrix deposition and the establishment of the myofibroblast phenotype. As such, in vitro assays have demonstrated the ability of JNK inhibitors to reduce markers like α-SMA and collagen I, which are tightly correlated with disease progression in IPF (Popmihajlov et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2018). In three-dimensional culture systems that mimic the in vivo lung architecture, CC-90001 is anticipated to reduce fibroblast contractility and proliferation, which should translate into stabilization of lung function—as measured by FVC—in clinical settings. Importantly, the clinical advancement of CC-90001 into Phase II studies for IPF and PF-ILD provides real‐world validation for its translational potential (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Celgene, 2017).

Nevertheless, some challenges remain. The experience with CC-930 underscores the need for careful monitoring of hepatotoxicity, and while chemical refinements in CC-90001 appear to have mitigated these issues, longer-term safety data will be critical (van der Velden et al., 2016). Furthermore, the complex biology of IPF, marked by a heterogeneous and multifactorial pathogenesis that involves both SMAD‐dependent and independent pathways of TGF-β signaling, suggests that targeting JNK alone may not fully reverse the fibrotic process. There is a possibility of compensatory activation of other profibrotic cascades, which could necessitate combination therapy strategies with currently approved antifibrotic agents such as pirfenidone and nintedanib (Kolb et al., 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, the heterogeneity of lung fibrotic diseases poses a challenge in demonstrating broad efficacy across diverse patient subgroups. A robust biomarker strategy, incorporating parameters such as MMP-7, SP-D, and tenascin-C, will be essential to discern subpopulations that may derive the greatest benefit from CC-90001 (Popmihajlov et al., 2022; van der Velden et al., 2020).

On a mechanistic level, evidence from preclinical studies using genetic ablation of JNK1 in airway epithelial cells supports the notion that epithelial JNK activity is critical for driving fibrotic remodeling (van der Velden et al., 2020). These studies indicate that JNK inhibition not only attenuates fibrosis by directly impacting fibroblast function but also modulates epithelial cell plasticity, which contributes to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is a hallmark of IPF pathology. This dual targeting—affecting both fibroblasts and epithelial cells—strengthens the therapeutic rationale behind CC-90001 (van der Velden et al., 2020; Popmihajlov et al., 2022).

In summary, CC-90001 is a well-rationalized, second-generation JNK inhibitor that directly addresses key pathological mechanisms underlying IPF by inhibiting non-SMAD TGF-β signaling and reducing c-Jun phosphorylation, fibroblast proliferation, and myofibroblast differentiation. Its chemical refinement from earlier compounds has resulted in improved selectivity and a more favorable safety profile, while preclinical data robustly support its antifibrotic potential in both cellular models and animal studies (Popmihajlov et al., 2022; van der Velden et al., 2016). Early clinical trial data further reinforce its potential utility in mitigating fibrosis and stabilizing lung function in IPF patients (Celgene, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, long-term safety, particularly concerning hepatotoxicity, and the need to address potential compensatory pathways in the complex profibrotic signaling network remain areas requiring continued investigation. Ultimately, with a combination of robust mechanistic insights and promising initial clinical signals, CC-90001 holds considerable promise as a novel therapeutic agent in IPF. Its integration into combination therapy regimens may further enhance its clinical impact by complementing existing antifibrotic drugs to address this devastating disease more comprehensively (Kolb et al., 2017; Popmihajlov et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
