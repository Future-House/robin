Proposal for Vorinostat (SAHA, Selleckchem S1047)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate: Vorinostat, also known as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), is a synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor belonging to the hydroxamic acid class of pan‐histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors that was originally developed for use in oncology and approved by the FDA for treatment of cutaneous T‐cell lymphoma (Korfei et al., 2018). Its discovery emerged from efforts to modulate epigenetic regulation in cancer, where compounds that could chelate the zinc ion at the active site of HDAC enzymes were found to restore expression of silenced tumor suppressor genes (Korfei et al., 2022). This class of therapeutic agents is known for its ability to increase the acetylation levels of histones—and non‐histone proteins—in various cell types, thereby modulating gene expression profiles through chromatin remodeling (Korfei et al., 2022). Vorinostat has proven effective as a single agent in cancer therapy and is characterized by its oral bioavailability, well‐defined pharmacokinetic parameters, and an established safety profile in oncology patients (Lyu et al., 2019). Its chemical synthesis involves constructing the hydroxamic acid moiety, which is critical for binding to the zinc ion in the catalytic domain of HDAC enzymes, resulting in global inhibition across Class I, II, and IV HDAC isoforms (Korfei et al., 2018).

Therapeutic History: Vorinostat’s initial therapeutic applications were in the oncologic setting where its broad-spectrum inhibition of HDACs caused reactivation of tumor suppressor genes, induction of cell cycle arrest, and triggering of apoptosis in cancer cells (Korfei et al., 2022). Its development as an anticancer drug has been thoroughly evaluated both preclinically and clinically; extensive studies documented its clinical effectiveness and tolerability in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and other malignancies (Lyu et al., 2019). Although Vorinostat has not been directly evaluated in clinical trials for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), its repurposing potential arises from shared molecular mechanisms between cancer-associated fibroblast pathology and the aberrant fibroblast activation observed in fibrotic lung diseases (Korfei et al., 2018). Previous research in lung fibrosis models and IPF patient-derived fibroblasts has demonstrated that pan-HDAC inhibitors such as panobinostat and trichostatin A can modulate fibroblast activity, promote apoptosis, and reduce extracellular matrix deposition (Korfei et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2024). This evidence encourages the exploration of Vorinostat for IPF, leveraging its well-established clinical profile in oncology to accelerate potential repurposing for fibrotic lung diseases (Lyu et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action: Vorinostat exerts its pharmacological effects by inhibiting histone deacetylases through binding to their zinc-dependent catalytic domains, thereby preventing the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues on histone tails and various transcription factors (Korfei et al., 2022). This inhibition causes histone hyperacetylation, leading to a more open chromatin configuration that facilitates the transcription of genes, including those with antifibrotic and pro-apoptotic functions such as FAS and COX2 (Korfei et al., 2022). In the context of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, aberrant activity of Class I and Class II HDACs is believed to contribute significantly to the fibrotic phenotype by silencing antifibrotic genes and promoting fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation—which is characterized by increased α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) expression and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) production (Korfei et al., 2018). Vorinostat’s pan-HDAC inhibition is anticipated to reverse these epigenetic modifications, thereby restoring the transcription of antifibrotic genes and inducing apoptosis in the pathologically activated fibroblasts (Lyu et al., 2019). Molecular studies have demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors such as Vorinostat enhance the acetylation status of non-histone proteins including p53—a critical tumor suppressor and pro-apoptotic factor—and tubulin, which may further modulate cell cycle progression and decrease cell motility (Korfei et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2024). These biochemical interactions collectively promote a state of growth arrest, reduced collagen synthesis, and diminished contractility among fibroblasts, which are central aspects of the antifibrotic response in IPF (Korfei et al., 2018).

Expected Effect: In the proposed assays, Vorinostat is expected to increase global histone acetylation in IPF fibroblasts, thereby reactivating silenced antifibrotic genes such as FAS and COX2 while simultaneously repressing profibrotic genes including those encoding collagen I and αSMA (Korfei et al., 2022). In vitro studies with pan-HDAC inhibitors have demonstrated significant reductions in fibroblast proliferation, decreased expression of contraction-associated markers, and suppression of fibroblast contractility in 3D collagen gel assays, suggesting that Vorinostat would elicit comparable effects (Korfei et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2024). The expected cascade of molecular events involves the derepression of pro-apoptotic pathways through enhanced acetylation of p53, combined with inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)/SMAD signaling, which is central to the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts (Korfei et al., 2018; Lyu et al., 2019). By modulating these pathways, Vorinostat is anticipated to reduce the contractile and synthetic activities of fibroblasts, thereby curbing the extent of extracellular matrix deposition and fibrotic remodeling within the lung (Korfei et al., 2022). Furthermore, preclinical murine models of lung fibrosis have already indicated that pan-HDAC inhibitors can lead to attenuation of fibrosis and improved lung function, providing a promising in vivo rationale for the use of Vorinostat in IPF (Korfei et al., 2018; Lyu et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation: Overall, Vorinostat presents as a highly promising candidate for repurposing as an antifibrotic therapy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, showing substantial mechanistic rationale based on extensive preclinical evidence and its established pharmacologic profile in oncology (Korfei et al., 2022; Mora et al., 2017). Its primary strengths lie in its ability to globally inhibit multiple HDAC isoforms—a key driver of the aberrant epigenetic state seen in IPF fibroblasts—and to reactivate antifibrotic pathways that are silenced in the diseased lung (Korfei et al., 2018; Lyu et al., 2019). These effects are mediated through increased histone acetylation, which is associated with transcriptional upregulation of pro-apoptotic and antifibrotic genes, and downregulation of molecules responsible for the fibrotic phenotype, such as collagen I and αSMA (Korfei et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2024). Additionally, the extensive clinical experience of Vorinostat in the oncology field lends support to its safety and tolerability profile, potentially streamlining its repurposing pipeline for IPF (Lyu et al., 2019; Mora et al., 2017).

However, there are inherent challenges and weaknesses associated with its broad-spectrum mode of action. First, pan-HDAC inhibition may lead to off-target effects given that HDAC enzymes play crucial roles in normal cellular homeostasis, particularly in non-fibrotic cells such as alveolar epithelial type II cells, which are critical for lung repair (Korfei et al., 2022; Korfei et al., 2015). Moreover, while the antifibrotic effects due to reactivation of pathways such as FAS-mediated apoptosis are desirable, the potential cytotoxicity induced by excessive HDAC inhibition must be carefully balanced with therapeutic efficacy to avoid compromising normal lung function (Korfei et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2024). Another potential drawback is the lack of direct clinical evidence in IPF, as most of the supportive data arise from preclinical models or studies in cancer, necessitating rigorous phase I/II trials to evaluate optimal dosing, delivery strategies tailored for pulmonary tissue, and long-term safety in the context of a chronic fibrotic disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Mora et al., 2017). It is also important to note that while the mechanism of epigenetic modulation offers a compelling therapeutic approach, the very complexity of the epigenome in IPF may require more selective inhibition of specific HDAC isoforms to minimize adverse effects, as opposed to pan-HDAC inhibition which can disrupt a broad array of cellular processes (Korfei et al., 2022).

In summary, Vorinostat (SAHA) is a well-characterized pan-HDAC inhibitor with a robust history in cancer therapy that exhibits a strong mechanistic rationale for repurposing in IPF based on its ability to increase histone acetylation, reactivate antifibrotic and pro-apoptotic genes, reduce αSMA transcription, and suppress fibroblast contractility in 3D collagen gel assays (Korfei et al., 2022; Korfei et al., 2018). The compound is expected to counteract the epigenetic repression present in fibrotic lung tissue, thereby mitigating fibroblast activation and ECM production—a hypothesis supported by both in vitro and preclinical in vivo data (Lyu et al., 2019). While Vorinostat’s established clinical safety in oncology and its broad epigenetic activity represent significant strengths, potential off-target effects, the necessity for dosage optimization, and the absence of direct clinical trials in IPF pose challenges that must be addressed in future investigations (Korfei et al., 2018; Mora et al., 2017). Therefore, from our comprehensive review of the biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature, Vorinostat holds considerable promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, warranting further preclinical studies and targeted clinical trials to determine its efficacy and safety profile specifically in the context of pulmonary fibrosis (Lyu et al., 2019; Cheng et al., 2024).
