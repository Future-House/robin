Proposal for GLPG1690 (Autotaxin inhibitor, Galapagos)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
GLPG1690 is a first‐in‐class, orally available, synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor of autotaxin (ATX) that was discovered and optimized through structure‐based drug design and high-throughput screening methodologies (Jia et al., 2021). This compound belongs to the class of ATX inhibitors, which are designed to block the enzymatic activity of autotaxin responsible for catalyzing the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA); a lipid mediator implicated in cell proliferation, migration, and fibrosis (Ninou et al., 2018). ATX inhibitors as a class have been investigated for their antifibrotic potential in various experimental models of fibrosis and have been proposed as novel therapeutic approaches for diseases characterized by excessive fibrotic remodeling, including Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) (Maher et al., 2019). The synthesis and optimization of GLPG1690 involved a combination of medicinal chemistry strategies designed to yield a molecule with high potency, favorable pharmacokinetics, and a robust pharmacodynamic profile that achieves significant reduction in plasma LPA levels (van der Aar et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
GLPG1690 has progressed through early-phase clinical development for IPF after extensive preclinical validation in various animal models of lung fibrosis, where inhibition of the ATX/LPA axis resulted in reduced fibroblast activation and improved tissue architecture (Ninou et al., 2018). In Phase I studies, GLPG1690 demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in healthy volunteers, with dose-dependent reductions in plasma LPA levels that provided evidence of target engagement (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014). The compound advanced into Phase IIa (FLORA study) in patients with IPF, where preliminary data indicated stabilization—and in some instances, a modest improvement—of forced vital capacity (FVC), a key clinical measure of lung function in IPF (Choi, 2021). Despite these promising early signals, subsequent Phase III trials, notably ISABELA 1 and ISABELA 2, were eventually terminated because the benefit-risk profile did not sufficiently favor continued development in the target IPF populations (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018). Historically, this candidate represents a translational effort from the robust preclinical evidence supporting the role of elevated LPA levels in fibrotic disease to an innovative clinical trial program targeting a clearly defined molecular pathway, even though its clinical trajectory has been challenging (Glass et al., 2022; Maher et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
The biological rationale underlying GLPG1690 is centered on its ability to inhibit autotaxin with high potency and selectivity, thereby reducing the generation of LPA from lysophosphatidylcholine (Nikolaou et al., 2017). At the molecular level, GLPG1690 binds competitively to the hydrophobic pocket and allosteric tunnel of ATX by a hybrid binding mode that effectively prevents the substrate lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) from accessing the active site, resulting in a marked decrease in LPA production (Banerjee et al., 2022). LPA acts through a series of G protein-coupled receptors including LPAR1, which is highly expressed in lung fibroblasts, and through these receptors, it drives pathways that underpin fibroblast migration, proliferation, differentiation into myofibroblasts, and 3D collagen gel contraction—all central events in the fibrotic process (Volkmann et al., 2024). Inhibition of the ATX/LPA signaling axis not only attenuates direct fibrogenic effects on fibroblasts but may also decrease vascular leak and inflammatory cytokine production, thereby interfering with multiple pathogenetic steps that contribute to the progressive scarring and decline in lung function associated with IPF (Saito et al., 2019). Furthermore, preclinical studies have confirmed that GLPG1690 achieves reductions in plasma LPA levels of up to 90% and shows significant antifibrotic effects in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis models by suppressing key mediators such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (van der Aar et al., 2019; Ninou et al., 2018).

Expected Effect:
The working hypothesis is that by inhibiting autotaxin, GLPG1690 will lower circulating and local LPA levels, thereby suppressing LPA-driven fibroblast activation, proliferation, and 3D collagen gel contraction, which are primary contributors to the fibrotic remodeling observed in IPF (Tzouvelekis, n.d.). In experimental assays, it is expected that treatment with GLPG1690 will lead to a significant reduction in LPA levels as measured in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), correlating with decreased expression of fibrotic markers and improved lung function parameters in treated subjects (Choi, 2021; Maher et al., 2019). On a cellular level, GLPG1690 is anticipated to attenuate fibroblast-mediated contraction of collagen gels in vitro, an effect that is directly reflective of its mechanism of blocking the fibroblast activation cascade (Unknown Reference). Experimentally, fibroblasts isolated from IPF patients are known to express high levels of LPA receptors and exhibit enhanced contractile and proliferative responses to LPA, which further underscores the potential impact of autotaxin inhibition on this cell type (Volkmann et al., 2024; Ninou et al., 2018). Moreover, robust pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiling in early studies demonstrated that GLPG1690 has favorable bioavailability and a sustained capacity to reduce LPA levels over a 24-hour dosing interval, thereby supporting once-daily administration that is conducive to chronic therapy in IPF (Taneja et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, GLPG1690 presents as a highly mechanistically sound therapeutic candidate for IPF with several strengths that underscore its potential despite setbacks encountered during later-phase clinical studies. One of its primary strengths is its robust and well-characterized mechanism of action: by selectively inhibiting autotaxin, GLPG1690 effectively reduces LPA production and thereby disrupts the LPA-driven signaling cascade that is fundamental to fibroblast activation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix deposition (Ninou et al., 2018; Volkmann et al., 2024). In addition, preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated significant antifibrotic effects in animal models, including reductions in skin and lung fibrosis markers, lending strong biological plausibility to the approach (Ishii, 2023; Spagnolo et al., 2020). The compound’s pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles have been thoroughly characterized, showing dose-dependent and sustained lowering of LPA levels with favorable bioavailability, which supports the rationale for a once-daily dosing regimen—a critical factor for long-term management of chronic diseases like IPF (van der Aar et al., 2019; Taneja et al., 2019). Furthermore, early-phase clinical studies, such as the FLORA trial, provided encouraging evidence of target engagement and hints of clinical benefit in terms of preserved lung function as measured by forced vital capacity (FVC), which is a validated surrogate endpoint in IPF (Choi, 2021; Maher et al., 2019).

However, several weaknesses temper the enthusiasm for GLPG1690 in its current form. The termination of Phase III trials (ISABELA 1 and ISABELA 2) due to an unfavorable benefit-risk profile indicates that, while the mechanism is compelling, the clinical efficacy and safety in a broader patient population were insufficiently robust despite promising early-phase data (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018). One potential challenge relates to substrate competition; GLPG1690 competes with the natural substrate (LPC) for binding to ATX, and in physiological conditions where elevated LPC concentrations are present, the inhibitory effect on LPA production may be diminished (Banerjee et al., 2022). Additionally, the overall clinical impact on slowing fibrosis progression and improving survival outcomes in IPF has not been convincingly demonstrated, raising questions about the translational gap between preclinical efficacy and clinical performance (Glass et al., 2022; Ntatsoulis et al., 2021). There is also concern regarding the potential for off-target effects and adverse events associated with broad inhibition of the ATX/LPA axis given LPA’s role in normal tissue homeostasis and repair mechanisms (Unknown Reference).

In light of these factors, while GLPG1690 itself has encountered challenges in the clinical setting, its preclinical efficacy and mechanistic clarity provide a robust foundation for future development. There is considerable potential in either developing optimized analogs that overcome the limitations observed in Phase III trials or employing GLPG1690 in combination with existing antifibrotic agents such as pirfenidone or nintedanib in order to achieve synergistic effects and minimize adverse outcomes (Spagnolo et al., 2020; Ntatsoulis et al., 2021). The well-validated role of the ATX/LPA axis in IPF pathogenesis, with elevated LPA levels correlating with disease severity, supports continued exploration of this target (Isshiki et al., 2022; Volkmann et al., 2024). Future strategies might involve refining patient selection criteria, closer monitoring of pharmacodynamic biomarkers such as plasma LPA species (e.g., LPA C18:2), and adjustments to dosing regimens to balance efficacy with safety (van der Aar et al., 2019; Maher et al., 2025).

Overall, GLPG1690 remains a highly promising therapeutic candidate from a molecular and biochemical standpoint owing to its targeted inhibition of the ATX/LPA axis, which is a key driver of fibrotic remodeling in IPF. Its preclinical data and early-phase clinical signals affirm that modulating this pathway can reduce fibroblast activation and potentially stabilize lung function (Volkmann et al., 2024; Ninou et al., 2018). However, setbacks in advanced-stage clinical trials highlight a critical need for further optimization—whether through structural analog development or combination therapy approaches—to fully harness the antifibrotic potential of ATX inhibition in the complex and heterogeneous landscape of IPF (Ntatsoulis et al., 2021; Unknown Reference).

In conclusion, while GLPG1690’s journey as a standalone therapeutic candidate for IPF has encountered significant challenges, its robust preclinical validation, well-characterized pharmacokinetic profile, and compelling mechanistic rationale solidify the theoretical basis for targeting the ATX/LPA axis in fibrotic lung disease. This candidate’s experience provides critical insights for refining future therapeutic approaches, either through next-generation analogs with improved efficacy and safety profiles or as part of combination regimens designed to enhance overall antifibrotic activity. The substantial body of preclinical and early-phase clinical evidence supports continued research investment in this pathway, and with strategic modifications, compounds derived from the GLPG1690 platform may yet offer a viable means to significantly alter the course of IPF (Maher et al., 2019; Spagnolo et al., 2020; Unknown Reference).
