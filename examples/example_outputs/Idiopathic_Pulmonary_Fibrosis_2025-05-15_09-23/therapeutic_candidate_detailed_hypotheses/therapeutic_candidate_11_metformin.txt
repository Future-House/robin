Proposal for Metformin (Selleckchem S1952)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Metformin is a well‐established, small‐molecule agent originally derived from the natural product galegine – an ingredient found in the French lilac (Galega officinalis). It belongs to the biguanide family of compounds and has been used for decades as a first‐line oral therapeutic for type 2 diabetes, where its primary role is to lower blood glucose levels through improvement of insulin sensitivity. The chemical synthesis of metformin involves the reaction of dimethylamine hydrochloride with cyanoguanidine under controlled conditions; this well‐defined synthetic process has enabled its widespread availability and use across multiple countries. As a member of the biguanide drug class, metformin’s role in type 2 diabetes management is supported by a large body of clinical data attesting to its safety, tolerability, and efficacy. Moreover, its pharmacokinetic profile is well understood, including relatively high oral bioavailability and wide tissue distribution, including the lung. Overall, metformin is a natural candidate for repurposing in other diseases because its decades of clinical use have provided robust insights into its mechanism(s) of action and safety in long‐term administration (Cheng et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Metformin has an extensive therapeutic history in the management of metabolic diseases, specifically type 2 diabetes mellitus. Historically, its clinical use hinges on its ability to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve peripheral insulin sensitivity. Over time, observational studies have suggested that metformin may offer ancillary benefits such as anti‐aging effects, reductions in cancer risk, and modulation of inflammation. This broad spectrum of beneficial effects has stimulated interest in exploring metformin’s potential beyond glycemic control. In the context of lung diseases, several preclinical studies have evaluated metformin for its anti‐fibrotic activity. Notably, experimental models, including bleomycin‐induced lung fibrosis in mice, have demonstrated that metformin can reverse established fibrosis via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Rangarajan et al., 2018). Furthermore, in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis models – which share molecular and cellular features with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) – metformin not only reduced inflammation and oxidative stress but also inhibited the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition that underlies fibrogenesis (Cheng et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021). In retrospective clinical analyses evaluating concomitant medications in IPF patients, metformin use did not significantly alter disease progression, though the findings remained inconclusive and suggest the need for more controlled clinical interventions (Kreuter et al., 2019). At present, a search on ClinicalTrials.gov using the query “AREA[InterventionName]Metformin AND AREA[Condition]Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis” indicates no registered clinical trials specifically evaluating metformin in IPF (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This history of preclinical evidence, combined with extensive human safety data from its antidiabetic application, provides a robust foundation for exploring metformin as a repurposed therapeutic candidate in IPF.

Mechanism of Action:
Metformin’s primary biochemical action is the activation of AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor that regulates metabolic homeostasis. Upon activation, AMPK modulates a broad range of downstream pathways, including the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, thereby promoting autophagy, reducing protein synthesis, and ultimately leading to a reduction in cell proliferation and enhanced cellular repair processes. One of the particularly promising aspects of AMPK activation is its ability to interfere with pro‐fibrotic signaling pathways. In the context of pulmonary fibrosis, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) is a key cytokine that drives fibrogenesis through the phosphorylation of SMAD3. Phosphorylated SMAD3 translocates to the nucleus where it binds to regulatory sequences to induce genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) production, fibroblast activation, and myofibroblast differentiation. Preclinical studies have shown that metformin can inhibit TGF-β1-induced SMAD3 phosphorylation in lung fibroblasts, leading to reduced expression of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), collagen type I, and fibronectin – all critical markers of myofibroblast activation (Cheng et al., 2021; Rangarajan et al., 2018).

Beyond the direct inhibition of SMAD3 signaling, metformin also has effects on mechanotransduction pathways mediated by the transcriptional regulators YAP/TAZ. In fibrotic conditions, increased matrix stiffness and cellular tension drive YAP/TAZ nuclear localization, which in turn enhances fibroblast contractility, proliferation, and further production of ECM components. Although not all studies have provided explicit experimental data regarding metformin’s direct action on YAP/TAZ in IPF models, literature suggests that the modulation of AMPK by metformin indirectly suppresses YAP/TAZ-mediated responses by attenuating the cytoskeletal tension and mechanical signals that activate these transcription factors (Rangarajan et al., 2018; Matsubayashi et al., 2023). Additionally, metformin has been shown to reduce oxidative stress by downregulating NADPH oxidase isoform NOX4 – an enzyme that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and further amplifies fibrotic signaling – thereby decreasing the oxidative milieu that contributes to fibroblast activation and ECM deposition (Sato et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2018). There is also evidence that metformin’s suppression of fibroblast activation involves the regulation of STAT3 and S100A4, which are implicated in cell migration, contractility, and ECM remodeling, although these pathways are less characterized with respect to TGF-β1/SMAD3 or YAP/TAZ in the immediate context of IPF (Ji et al., 2023). In summary, metformin exerts its potential antifibrotic effects by a multifaceted mechanism: activating AMPK; dampening TGF-β1-induced SMAD3 phosphorylation; attenuating YAP/TAZ-mediated mechanotransduction; reducing NOX4-driven ROS production; and ultimately decreasing the contractility and ECM deposition by fibroblasts. These molecular interactions are supported by numerous preclinical investigations using both bleomycin-induced and silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis models (Cheng et al., 2021; Rangarajan et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay employing 3D collagen matrices to simulate the lung extracellular environment, the hypothesis is that metformin will reduce fibroblast contractility, a key contributor to tissue stiffening in IPF. By inhibiting TGF-β1-driven SMAD3 phosphorylation, metformin is expected to attenuate the induction of pro-fibrotic markers, including αSMA and collagen type I, which are vital for myofibroblast differentiation. Studies have demonstrated that treatment with metformin in fibroblast cultures leads to a downregulation of these markers, resulting in decreased collagen deposition and a reduction in the contractile phenotype of the cells (Sato et al., 2016; Rangarajan et al., 2018). Additionally, the reduction in YAP/TAZ activity – either directly or via decreased mechanical feedback from the extracellular matrix – should result in less pronounced fibroblast contractility, ultimately alleviating the mechanical stresses that drive further fibrogenesis (Matsubayashi et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2021). In vitro, it is anticipated that metformin will show a dose-dependent reduction in fibroblast contractile forces in 3D collagen gel contraction assays, thereby serving as a surrogate for its potential to reduce lung stiffness in vivo. Moreover, metformin’s ability to activate AMPK is associated with improved mitochondrial function and enhanced autophagy, which contributes to the deactivation or reprogramming of myofibroblasts into a less fibrogenic phenotype. These expected cellular and molecular effects are congruent with findings from animal models in which metformin treatment has led to measurable decreases in collagen deposition and amelioration of fibrosis (Rangarajan et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Finally, given metformin’s extensive history of safe oral administration and its known lung tissue distribution, the translational potential to use clinically relevant oral doses – which fall within its known therapeutic range for diabetes – is a significant point favoring its repurposing in IPF, despite the fact that many in vitro studies have employed higher concentrations that may not directly reflect plasma levels in humans (Matsubayashi et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Metformin presents as a promising candidate for repurposing as an antifibrotic therapy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis due to its well-established safety profile, extensive clinical use, and robust preclinical evidence supporting its multifaceted mechanisms of action. The strengths of metformin include its ability to activate AMPK, which has a central role in counteracting fibrogenic signaling cascades, particularly TGF-β1-induced SMAD3 phosphorylation. In numerous preclinical studies using bleomycin- and silica-induced models, metformin has been shown to reduce key fibrotic markers, decrease fibroblast contractility, and modulate cellular processes such as autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis (Cheng et al., 2021; Rangarajan et al., 2018). Its putative capacity to block YAP/TAZ-mediated mechanotransduction further contributes to its potential in reducing extracellular matrix deposition and tissue stiffening – central pathological features of IPF (Matsubayashi et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2021). Additionally, the oral dosing regimen, cost-effectiveness, and established human safety data from its use in metabolic diseases make metformin an attractive option for further investigation in IPF.

However, there are several weaknesses and uncertainties that must be acknowledged. First, despite encouraging preclinical data, there remains an absence of controlled clinical trial evidence demonstrating metformin’s efficacy specifically in IPF patients; current clinical data have been largely observational or retrospective in nature and did not indicate significant changes in clinically relevant outcomes when metformin was used as a concomitant treatment (Kreuter et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Second, many of the in vitro studies describing metformin’s antifibrotic effects have employed drug concentrations that are significantly higher than the plasma concentrations achievable with standard dosing in humans; this discrepancy raises concerns regarding the translation of in vitro mechanistic findings to clinical benefit (Matsubayashi et al., 2023). Finally, while the mechanisms of AMPK activation, SMAD3 inhibition, and modulation of YAP/TAZ are well supported by experimental evidence, the interactions among these pathways in the complex milieu of human IPF lungs may be influenced by additional factors such as comorbid conditions, variable drug penetration in fibrotic tissues, and the heterogeneity of IPF pathology. The challenges in accurately recapitulating the human pathophysiology in animal models further complicate the assessment of metformin’s antifibrotic potential.

In conclusion, metformin demonstrates multiple strengths as a therapeutic candidate for IPF, including its robust mechanism of action based on AMPK activation, inhibition of profibrotic TGF-β1/SMAD3 signaling, and potential suppression of YAP/TAZ-mediated mechanotransduction pathways. The compound’s established human safety profile and oral dosing regimen further support its feasibility for repurposing. Yet, the primary limitations lie in the lack of direct clinical trial evidence evaluating its efficacy in IPF, and the challenges associated with bridging the gap between preclinical drug concentrations and clinically relevant dosing. As such, while metformin remains a highly promising candidate based on extensive preclinical research, further rigorous clinical investigation – including dose-optimization studies and randomized controlled trials in IPF patient populations – is warranted to comprehensively validate its therapeutic potential in this devastating disease (Cheng et al., 2021; Rangarajan et al., 2018; Matsubayashi et al., 2023).
