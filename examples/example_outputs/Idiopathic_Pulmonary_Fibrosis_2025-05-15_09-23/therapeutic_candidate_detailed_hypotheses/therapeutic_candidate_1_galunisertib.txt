Proposal for Galunisertib (LY2157299, Selleckchem S2673)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Galunisertib (LY2157299) is a synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor discovered through medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at identifying compounds capable of selectively inhibiting the transforming growth factor‐β receptor I (TGF‐βRI, also known as ALK5) kinase domain. This candidate belongs to the class of small‐molecule TGF‐β receptor kinase inhibitors that were originally developed for oncology indications but are now being considered for repurposing in fibrotic diseases such as Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). The synthesis and optimization of galunisertib involved structure–activity relationship studies to maximize its potency toward TGF‐βRI while minimizing off‐target effects, with extensive in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic profiling that confirmed its ability to inhibit phosphorylation of downstream effectors such as SMAD2/3 (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022; Lahn et al., 2015). This class of agents has historically been used to modulate TGF‐β signaling in various settings including cancer and preclinical models of fibrosis, given TGF‐β’s notorious promiscuous role in driving fibrogenesis and tumor progression alike.

Therapeutic History:
Galunisertib has been most extensively evaluated in the oncology arena. Preclinical and clinical studies in malignancies – ranging from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to glioma – have established that galunisertib is orally bioavailable and exhibits a target engagement profile that is evidenced by reduced phosphorylation of SMAD2 in peripheral tissues (Lahn et al., 2015; Kelley et al., 2019). In phase I and II oncology trials, its safety profile was characterized as manageable with intermittent dosing schedules designed to mitigate potential adverse effects associated with chronic TGF‐β blockade (Lahn et al., 2015; Kelley et al., 2019). However, a comprehensive clinical trial search for lung fibrosis or IPF with galunisertib yielded no registered studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), indicating that despite its promising pharmacological profile, galunisertib has not yet been directly evaluated in patients with IPF or related interstitial lung diseases. That said, preclinical evidence in other fibrotic models – including studies demonstrating reduced collagen deposition, inhibition of fibroblast activation, and reversal of myofibroblast phenotypes – supports its potential repurposing for fibrotic diseases (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022; Dadrich et al., 2016). The oncology-derived safety and pharmacokinetic data provide strong proof-of-concept for chronic administration, critical for a disease like IPF where long-term therapy is required.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, galunisertib functions by selectively binding to the ATP-binding site of TGF‐β receptor I kinase, thereby inhibiting its catalytic activity. Inhibition of TGF‐βRI prevents the phosphorylation of receptor-activated SMAD proteins, specifically SMAD2 and SMAD3, which are critical mediators of the canonical TGF‐β signaling cascade (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022; Lahn et al., 2015). As a consequence, the nuclear translocation of the SMAD2/3 complex and its subsequent transcriptional regulation of profibrotic target genes, such as collagen type I (COL1A1), α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), and fibronectin, is substantially reduced. This mechanistic blockade underlies the expected inhibition of fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation—a process central to the pathogenesis of IPF (Inui et al., 2021; Biernacka et al., 2011). Moreover, the compound has been shown in preclinical assays to reduce collagen gel contraction, a surrogate measure of myofibroblast contractile function, thus further supporting its antifibrotic potential (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022; Dadrich et al., 2016). The broad consensus from biochemical studies is that TGF‐β/SMAD signaling is a major driver of fibrogenesis; hence, selective inhibition of this pathway by galunisertib has the potential to intercept or reverse the fibrotic process by halting myofibroblast activation and excessive ECM production (Jing et al., 2025; Lahn et al., 2015). Its selective kinase inhibition distinguishes it from less specific approaches such as monoclonal antibodies or antisense oligonucleotides targeting TGF‐β isoforms, potentially offering an improved therapeutic index and oral dosing convenience (Lahn et al., 2015; Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing galunisertib in IPF is that by blocking TGF‐β1-induced SMAD2/3 phosphorylation in lung fibroblasts, the drug will prevent the upregulation of profibrotic markers such as αSMA, subsequently inhibiting the differentiation of fibroblasts into contractile myofibroblasts. In the proposed assays, one would expect to see a significant reduction in SMAD2/3 activation as measured by phospho-SMAD2/3 levels, which is a direct biomarker of TGF‐βRI activity (Lahn et al., 2015; Rodón et al., 2015). In addition, primary human lung fibroblast cultures treated with galunisertib should yield lower mRNA and protein expressions of αSMA, collagen type I, and other extracellular matrix components, as documented by quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022; Inui et al., 2021). When examining fibroblast function using 3D collagen gel contraction assays, the expectation is that inhibition of TGF‐β signaling by galunisertib will reduce the contractile force of these cells, leading to less collagen gel contraction—a surrogate for tissue stiffness and fibrotic remodeling (Dadrich et al., 2016; Lahn et al., 2015). Furthermore, given that genetic knockout of SMAD3 has been shown to protect against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, pharmacologically mimicking this effect via galunisertib is anticipated to yield a reduction in lung fibrosis in preclinical animal models (Biernacka et al., 2011; Lahn et al., 2015). The drug’s good oral bioavailability – as confirmed in oncology patients – means that chronic dosing regimens could feasibly be applied in IPF, which is critical for managing a progressive disease where long-term suppression of fibrogenesis is needed (Kelley et al., 2019; Lahn et al., 2015). Thus, the expected overall effect of galunisertib in the proposed assays would be a marked reduction in SMAD2/3 mediated profibrotic gene transcription, leading to lower αSMA expression, decreased fibroblast-mediated collagen contraction, and ultimately a less fibrotic lung architecture.

Overall Evaluation:
Galunisertib is a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in IPF due to several compelling strengths, though its application also presents certain challenges that must be addressed.

One notable strength is the mechanistic specificity of galunisertib. By directly targeting the ATP-binding pocket of TGF‐βRI, the drug potently inhibits the canonical TGF‐β/SMAD signaling cascade, a pathway that is universally acknowledged as a central driver of fibrosis. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that blockade of SMAD2/3 phosphorylation correlates with reduced collagen deposition and myofibroblast activation, offering a strong biochemical rationale for its efficacy in fibrotic diseases (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022; Lahn et al., 2015). Furthermore, the fact that genetic ablation of SMAD3 protects against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis reinforces the idea that pharmacologically replicating this effect could yield significant antifibrotic benefits (Biernacka et al., 2011). Additionally, galunisertib’s oral bioavailability, established through extensive clinical investigations in oncology, provides an important advantage for long-term administration in IPF patients who require chronic therapy (Kelley et al., 2019; Lahn et al., 2015).

Another strength is the body of preclinical data supporting the antifibrotic effects of TGF‐β receptor I kinase inhibitors. Though clinical trials in IPF are not yet available, the extrapolation from oncology and liver fibrosis models—where galunisertib has shown efficacy—creates a robust preclinical foundation (Luangmonkong et al., 2017; Dadrich et al., 2016). Key assays, such as collagen contraction, αSMA expression, and SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, have been well established in these contexts and would be expected to yield comparable results in lung fibroblast cultures (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022; Rodón et al., 2015). The emerging clinical data in various cancers, which indicate a manageable toxicity profile when administered orally on an intermittent schedule, further support the feasibility of repurposing galunisertib for a non-oncologic, chronic condition such as IPF (Lahn et al., 2015; Kelley et al., 2019).

However, several weaknesses and challenges must be considered. First, despite strong preclinical and oncology data, there is a notable absence of direct clinical studies evaluating galunisertib in pulmonary fibrosis; indeed, a comprehensive search has not revealed any registered IPF-specific clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This gap necessitates rigorous preclinical evaluation in lung-specific fibrosis models and primary human lung fibroblast assays to ascertain whether the antifibrotic activity observed in other tissues translates effectively to the pulmonary context (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022; Lahn et al., 2015).

A second potential weakness pertains to the dual and sometimes conflicting roles of TGF‐β in tissue homeostasis. TGF‐β not only mediates fibrogenesis but also crucially regulates immune responses and tissue repair; hence, prolonged systemic inhibition may disrupt normal reparative processes or lead to unforeseen immunological consequences (Jing et al., 2025; Holmgaard et al., 2018). The pleiotropic nature of TGF‐β signaling, while advantageous from a therapeutic targeting perspective, also raises concerns about off-target effects and tolerability issues when repurposing the drug outside an oncologic setting. It will therefore be essential to define a biologically effective dose that balances antifibrotic efficacy with minimal impact on the beneficial roles of TGF‐β in lung physiology (Lahn et al., 2015; Ye & Hu, 2021).

Moreover, the heterogeneity of fibroblast subpopulations within the lung and the complex interplay between canonical and non-canonical TGF‐β signaling pathways present additional challenges. While galunisertib selectively inhibits the SMAD-dependent pathway, non-canonical TGF‐β signaling mechanisms, which also contribute to myofibroblast differentiation and ECM deposition, may remain active. This incomplete blockade of the entire profibrotic network might necessitate combination therapies or additional agents to achieve a maximal therapeutic effect in IPF (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022; Dadrich et al., 2016).

From a clinical development standpoint, the oncology data provide a reasonable starting point regarding dosing, pharmacokinetics, and safety; however, the translation of dosing regimens from cancer patients, who often receive therapy over a relatively short term in a different pathological context, to a chronic disease like IPF will require careful adjustment. It will be important to determine whether the intermittent dosing schedules used in oncology can be effectively adapted for long-term management of IPF, where constant suppression of fibrogenic activity might be required (Kelley et al., 2019; Lahn et al., 2015).

Finally, while preclinical assays have demonstrated that galunisertib significantly reduces collagen contraction and myofibroblast activation in vitro, the complexity of fibrotic remodeling in vivo—including contributions from immune cells, epithelial cells, and vascular components—means that in vivo efficacy in animal models of pulmonary fibrosis must be thoroughly evaluated before clinical trials in IPF can be justified (Rodón et al., 2015; Luangmonkong et al., 2017).

Overall, the mechanistic specificity, oral bioavailability, and existing clinical safety data of galunisertib represent strong attributes in favor of its potential repurposing for IPF. The drug’s ability to block TGF‐βRI kinase activity and thereby inhibit SMAD2/3 phosphorylation directly addresses the central pathway driving myofibroblast differentiation and extracellular matrix deposition in IPF (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022; Lahn et al., 2015). However, significant gaps remain, notably the lack of direct IPF clinical data and the need to thoroughly evaluate the compound’s efficacy in lung-specific fibrotic models. The inherent complexity of TGF‐β signaling—with its critical roles in both pathological fibrosis and normal tissue homeostasis—requires that future studies carefully optimize dosing and monitor potential adverse effects. In conclusion, while galunisertib is mechanistically and pharmacologically promising for IPF therapy, further preclinical validation in pulmonary fibrosis models and subsequent clinical trials will be essential to fully establish its safety and efficacy in this challenging therapeutic area (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022; Lahn et al., 2015; Kelley et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
