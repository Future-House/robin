Proposal for Lenvatinib (E7080, Selleckchem S2184)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Lenvatinib (E7080, Selleckchem S2184) is a synthetic, orally available small‐molecule multi‐kinase inhibitor that was initially discovered through high‐throughput screening efforts aimed at identifying compounds capable of inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation targets (Hussein et al., 2017, pp. 10–11). It belongs to the class of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), a well‐established group of therapeutic compounds that have been used extensively in oncology to arrest tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis by blocking signaling through receptors such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs), fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), and platelet‐derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) (Grimminger et al., 2015, pp. 1–2). Lenvatinib is a product of an optimization process stemming from earlier antiangiogenic agents and has been synthesized with the intention of providing broad-spectrum inhibition of proangiogenic and growth factor pathways; its chemical structure has been refined to achieve nanomolar potency against its targets (Hussein et al., 2017, pp. 8–10). As a representative of its class, lenvatinib differs from several first-generation TKIs by virtue of its activity against multiple receptor subtypes, including inhibition of VEGFR1–3, FGFR1–4, PDGFRα, RET, and KIT, which positions it as capable of interfering with a range of signaling cascades implicated in aberrant cell proliferation and fibrotic remodeling (Grimminger et al., 2015, pp. 6–7).

Therapeutic History:
Lenvatinib has an established therapeutic history in oncology, having received regulatory approval for the treatment of unresectable thyroid cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma based on a robust clinical dataset demonstrating its antiangiogenic and antitumor properties (Hussein et al., 2017, pp. 10–11; Imakura et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). Its clinical development in these tumor settings has provided extensive data on its pharmacokinetics, dosing regimens, and safety profile in humans, and its oral availability makes it a convenient option for chronic administration in cancer patients (Hussein et al., 2017, pp. 10–11). Although lenvatinib’s use in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has not been clinically evaluated—as evidenced by searches on Clinical Trials showing no registered trials specific to IPF with lenvatinib (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—its mechanism of action suggests that it might be repurposed for fibrotic lung diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In preclinical studies conducted in non‐pulmonary fibrotic settings, such as liver fibrosis models, lenvatinib has been shown to inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cells—key mediators of fibrosis—thereby reducing extracellular matrix production and capillarization (Ogawa et al., 2021, pp. 2–4). This finding is relevant because the molecular drivers of fibrosis in the liver—mediated by pathways involving VEGFR, FGFR, and PDGFR—are similar to those operative in the pathogenesis of IPF, suggesting a potential therapeutic overlap (Grimminger et al., 2015, pp. 7–8). Although no direct veterinary or clinical data exist for lenvatinib in the context of IPF, the successful repurposing of other multi‐kinase inhibitors such as nintedanib in IPF provides a precedent that supports the exploration of lenvatinib as a therapeutic candidate for this devastating lung disease (Hostettler et al., 2014, pp. 1–2).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of action of lenvatinib is through the potent and selective inhibition of key receptor tyrosine kinases involved in angiogenesis and fibrogenesis, namely VEGFR1–3, FGFR1–4, and PDGFRα (Hussein et al., 2017, pp. 8–10; Grimminger et al., 2015, pp. 4–5). By binding to the ATP‐binding pocket of these receptors, lenvatinib competitively inhibits their kinase activity, which prevents receptor autophosphorylation and the subsequent activation of downstream signaling pathways such as the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK cascades (Bhatt et al., 2025, pp. 2–4; Hussein et al., 2017, pp. 8–10). The inhibition of these pathways is significant in the context of fibrotic diseases because they are responsible for mediating cellular processes including fibroblast proliferation, survival, extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis, and 3D collagen contraction (Grimminger et al., 2015, pp. 2–4). In IPF, overactivation of mitogenic signals such as those driven by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) contributes to the persistent activation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, leading to excessive collagen deposition and scarring (Chaudhary et al., 2007, pp. 1–2; Hostettler et al., 2014, pp. 1–2). Lenvatinib’s nanomolar inhibitory potency against these receptors means that it can effectively block the diverse pro-fibrotic stimuli that drive disease progression in IPF (Grimminger et al., 2015, pp. 7–8). Additionally, the blockade of FGFR signaling may have a dual effect by counteracting elements of the TGF-β pathway, a master regulator of fibrogenesis, further reducing myofibroblast differentiation and ECM production (Grimminger et al., 2015, pp. 4–5). Collectively, these molecular interactions suggest that lenvatinib has the biochemical potential to modulate critical pro-fibrotic pathways, thereby attenuating the pathological processes underlying IPF (Bhatt et al., 2025, pp. 6–7).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the expected effect of lenvatinib in assays evaluating IPF-related endpoints is a reduction in fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis, leading to diminished collagen deposition and decreased 3D collagen gel contraction (Chaudhary et al., 2007, pp. 1–2; Hostettler et al., 2014, pp. 5–7). In vitro, lung fibroblasts isolated from IPF patients typically exhibit upregulated PDGFR and FGFR expression with enhanced responsiveness to PDGF, FGF, and VEGF stimulation, resulting in increased cell proliferation, migration, and collagen production (Hostettler et al., 2014, pp. 1–2; Grimminger et al., 2015, pp. 2–4). When lenvatinib is applied to these cells, its inhibition of the relevant receptor tyrosine kinases is expected to normalize fibroblast behavior by blocking the overactive signaling cascades that drive ECM production (Grimminger et al., 2015, pp. 5–6). Consequently, the reduction in phosphorylation of downstream effectors such as Akt and ERK should translate into lower transcriptional activation of pro-fibrotic genes, including those encoding collagen type I and other ECM components (Bhatt et al., 2025, pp. 4–5). In a three-dimensional collagen gel contraction assay—an established ex vivo model for assessing fibroblast-mediated matrix remodeling—the inhibition of fibroblast contraction by lenvatinib would likely indicate its capacity to interfere with the mechanical aspects of fibrosis, an effect that is anticipated to mirror the action of approved antifibrotic agents like nintedanib (Hostettler et al., 2014, pp. 8–9; Grimminger et al., 2015, pp. 7–8). Overall, the expected therapeutic outcome is an attenuation of fibrogenic markers and a stabilization or even partial reversal of the pathologic fibrotic remodeling seen in IPF, supporting the underlying hypothesis that lenvatinib will dampen the multi-kinase mediated pro-fibrotic signaling in lung fibroblasts (Chaudhary et al., 2007, pp. 1–2).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, lenvatinib represents a promising repurposed drug candidate for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis based on its robust molecular profile as a multi-kinase inhibitor that targets key pro-fibrotic receptor tyrosine kinases such as VEGFR, FGFR, and PDGFR (Grimminger et al., 2015, pp. 1–2; Hussein et al., 2017, pp. 10–11). One of the principal strengths of lenvatinib is that its broad inhibition of multiple signaling pathways provides a comprehensive strategy to attenuate the heterogeneous yet overlapping mechanisms that drive fibroblast activation, ECM synthesis, and tissue remodeling in IPF (Grimminger et al., 2015, pp. 7–8; Bhatt et al., 2025, pp. 2–4). Moreover, the favorable oral pharmacokinetic profile and extensive safety data accumulated from oncology trials offer significant advantages in terms of dosing convenience and known adverse event management (Hussein et al., 2017, pp. 10–11). The conceptual rationale is further supported by preclinical evidence from liver fibrosis models in which lenvatinib effectively inhibited stellate cell activation and fibrogenesis, suggesting that its antifibrotic properties may extend to pulmonary tissues (Ogawa et al., 2021, pp. 2–4).

However, several weaknesses must be considered. Despite its promising mechanistic profile, there remains a lack of direct preclinical data demonstrating lenvatinib’s efficacy in lung fibrosis models or its impact on pulmonary fibroblast function; the current literature does not include studies that have evaluated lenvatinib specifically in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, as indicated by the negative results from Clinical Trials searches (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while the inhibition of pathways such as VEGFR and FGFR is theoretically beneficial, the complex biology of IPF—where certain isoforms of these growth factors may exert protective effects—necessitates careful evaluation of potential off-target or paradoxical effects (Grimminger et al., 2015, pp. 2–4). There is also a concern regarding pulmonary safety, as clinical reports have documented cases of lenvatinib-induced interstitial pneumonia in oncologic patient populations, raising questions about its tolerability when repurposed for chronic lung diseases (Imakura et al., 2022, pp. 1–2, 6). Finally, without preclinical data in relevant lung fibrosis models, it is challenging to accurately predict its efficacy and optimal dosing in the pulmonary context.

Overall, lenvatinib exhibits significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for IPF due to its potent inhibition of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases implicated in fibrotic signaling pathways, its favorable pharmacokinetic profile from oncology studies, and the mechanistic rationale derived from analogous multi-kinase inhibitors like nintedanib that are already in use for IPF (Hostettler et al., 2014, pp. 1–2; Grimminger et al., 2015, pp. 7–8). Nonetheless, the absence of direct preclinical or clinical evidence in pulmonary fibrosis poses a considerable gap that must be addressed through targeted in vitro studies with lung fibroblasts, three-dimensional collagen gel contraction assays, and in vivo evaluation in bleomycin-induced or other lung fibrosis models before progressing to clinical trials. In conclusion, while lenvatinib’s broad, multi-axis inhibition of key pro-fibrotic receptors is scientifically compelling and may provide a novel approach to modulating fibrotic remodeling in IPF, further comprehensive preclinical investigation is essential to validate its efficacy and safety in this new application (Grimminger et al., 2015, pp. 4–5; Nishioka et al., 2021, p. 5).
