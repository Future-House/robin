Proposal for Dimethyl Fumarate (BG-12, Selleckchem S2874)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), marketed as BG-12 and commercially known as Tecfidera®, is a synthetic fumaric acid ester with a molecular weight of 144.13 g/mol that was originally developed for its immunomodulatory and anti‐inflammatory properties. DMF is synthesized through esterification of fumaric acid, yielding a compound with an α,β-unsaturated ester moiety that confers electrophilic properties, enabling it to react via Michael addition with thiol groups (Bresciani et al., 2023, pp. 2–3). Belonging to the class of fumarates, this therapeutic compound has been used extensively in the treatment of diseases such as psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. The chemical class of fumaric acid esters is well known for their capacity to modulate immune responses and oxidative stress, which has led to their repurposing for a range of chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders (Bresciani et al., 2023, pp. 2–3).

Therapeutic History:
DMF’s clinical utility has been established for decades. It was first introduced as an oral treatment for psoriasis in Europe and subsequently repurposed for relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) following large-scale phase 3 clinical trials demonstrating its safety and efficacy. Its use in these conditions has confirmed a favorable safety profile, manageable side effects, and robust immunomodulatory activity (Bresciani et al., 2023, p. 18). Although DMF has not been formally evaluated in registered clinical trials for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), its well‐documented antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties suggest potential utility in IPF, a disease characterized by persistent inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrotic remodeling (Grzegorzewska et al., 2017, pp. 2–3; Wang et al., 2022, pp. 1–3). Several preclinical studies in lung injury and fibrotic models, including bleomycin‐induced lung fibrosis, have demonstrated that DMF can attenuate fibrosis, reduce collagen deposition, and improve lung function, thereby providing an encouraging basis for its repurposing in pulmonary diseases (Kato et al., 2022, pp. 9–10; Grzegorzewska et al., 2017, pp. 1–2).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, DMF is best known for its ability to activate the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, which is a master regulator of cellular antioxidant responses. Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its inhibitory protein Keap1 and is targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. DMF, owing to its electrophilic α,β-unsaturated ester structure, covalently modifies reactive cysteine residues on Keap1 through Michael addition, leading to conformational changes that disrupt the Keap1–Nrf2 complex. This results in the stabilization and nuclear translocation of Nrf2, which binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoters of various cytoprotective genes (Bresciani et al., 2023, pp. 2–3; Pittalà et al., 2019, pp. 7–8). Subsequent upregulation of genes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase supports the maintenance of glutathione levels and the overall redox balance in cells. These antioxidant effects reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and ameliorate oxidative stress, a key contributor to the pathological activation of fibroblasts and progression of fibrosis (Hao et al., 2022, pp. 9–10; Kato et al., 2022, pp. 2–4).

In addition to Nrf2 activation, DMF has been shown to inhibit nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling by covalently modifying components of its signaling complex, which leads to a reduction in the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This dual modulation—antioxidant enhancement via Nrf2 and anti-inflammatory effects via NF-κB inhibition—creates a biochemical environment that is less favorable for the perpetuation of fibrotic signaling pathways such as transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signaling. TGF-β1 is central to the activation of lung fibroblasts, their differentiation into myofibroblasts, and the subsequent deposition of extracellular matrix components such as collagen. Preclinical evidence suggests that DMF can attenuate TGF-β1 induced fibroblast activation and reduce α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and collagen I synthesis, thereby decreasing fibroblast-mediated gel contraction in three-dimensional assays (Grzegorzewska et al., 2017, pp. 8–10; Pittalà et al., 2019, pp. 6–7).

Furthermore, DMF’s activation of the Nrf2 pathway has been associated with improved mitochondrial function and reduced apoptosis in stressed cells, contributing to overall tissue homeostasis. By reducing ROS generation and modulating inflammatory cytokines, DMF indirectly interferes with profibrotic signaling cascades that would otherwise contribute to persistent tissue remodeling and scar formation in IPF (Bresciani et al., 2023, pp. 16–17; Grzegorzewska et al., 2017, pp. 10–11).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing DMF in IPF hinges on its ability to mitigate oxidative stress-induced fibroblast activation. In the proposed assays, it is expected that DMF will activate the Nrf2 pathway in primary lung fibroblasts, leading to the upregulation of antioxidant defense enzymes such as HO-1. This molecular event is anticipated to result in a reduced intracellular ROS burden, thereby blunting the oxidative stress signal that drives the pathological activation of fibroblasts. Concomitantly, DMF is expected to downregulate TGF-β1 signaling, a primary profibrotic pathway that enhances fibroblast proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation, and extracellular matrix deposition. In 3D gel contraction assays, these combined effects would manifest as a decreased contractile activity of lung fibroblasts, reflective of a less activated, more quiescent phenotype (Grzegorzewska et al., 2017, pp. 11–12; Pittalà et al., 2019, pp. 7–8).

There is evidence from preclinical models in murine systems where DMF attenuated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, decreased collagen deposition, and improved respiratory function. These findings support the expected outcome that DMF will reduce key markers of fibrosis—such as αSMA and collagen I—in lung fibroblasts, leading to improved tissue architecture and function. Moreover, the documented expression of Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant genes in lung fibroblasts from IPF patients reinforces the molecular rationale that targeting this pathway will alleviate oxidative damage which is instrumental in fibroblast activation (Hao et al., 2022, pp. 9–10; Kato et al., 2022, pp. 4–6).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, DMF presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, based on its established clinical safety profile in multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, its clear mechanistic role in activating the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, and its capacity to attenuate inflammatory and fibrotic signaling cascades. One of the primary strengths of DMF is its dual mechanism of action; by simultaneously enhancing antioxidant defenses and suppressing pro-inflammatory NF-κB signaling, it addresses two central pathological drivers of IPF—oxidative stress and unwarranted inflammation—which in turn reduce aberrant fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition. Preclinical evidence from bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis models and studies on lung-targeted delivery further support its antifibrotic potential (Kato et al., 2022, pp. 9–10; Grzegorzewska et al., 2017, pp. 1–2).

Furthermore, the oral dosing regimen and well-understood pharmacokinetics of DMF facilitate easier translation from animal models to human clinical trials. The safety and tolerability of DMF in long-term use for other indications provide an important advantage in terms of risk mitigation when considering repurposing for IPF (Bresciani et al., 2023, p. 18; Grzegorzewska et al., 2017, pp. 2–3).

However, certain weaknesses must also be considered. Although the preclinical data are promising, there is currently an absence of direct clinical trial evidence in IPF patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, while DMF is broadly active in mitigating inflammation and oxidative stress, its precise impact on the complex interplay of profibrotic cytokines, particularly TGF-β1 and its downstream effectors, remains to be fully elucidated in the context of fibrotic lung tissue. There is also the potential for off-target effects given DMF’s electrophilic nature, which must be carefully monitored in the delicate pulmonary milieu. Furthermore, translating the benefits observed in animal models to human IPF may be challenging due to differences in disease etiology and progression between species (Grzegorzewska et al., 2017, pp. 6–8; Wang et al., 2022, pp. 1–3).

In conclusion, DMF’s well-documented activation of the Nrf2 pathway, its inhibition of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses, and its potential to downregulate TGF-β1-driven fibroblast activation render it a promising therapeutic candidate for IPF. The existing body of preclinical evidence, along with its established clinical track record in other chronic inflammatory diseases, justifies further focused investigation and possibly early-phase clinical trials in IPF patients to evaluate its efficacy and safety in this particularly challenging interstitial lung disease (Hao et al., 2022, pp. 9–10; Kato et al., 2022, pp. 9–10; Bresciani et al., 2023, pp. 16–17). Continued research should aim to clarify DMF’s precise molecular effects on TGF-β1 signaling in lung fibroblasts and to optimize dosing strategies for lung-targeted delivery, thereby maximizing benefits while minimizing potential systemic side effects.
