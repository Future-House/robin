Proposal for A-485 (CBP/p300 inhibitor, Cayman 17811)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
A-485 is a small‐molecule, drug‐like inhibitor that was discovered via structure‐based drug design and medicinal chemistry optimization targeting the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of the transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300. It belongs to the epigenetic modifier class, specifically the catalytic inhibitors of CBP/p300, and is characterized by its spiro-oxazolidinedione scaffold. Originally developed as a chemical probe to interrogate the functions of CBP/p300 in oncogenic transcription and chromatin regulation, A-485 displays potent and selective catalytic inhibition with low nanomolar inhibitory concentrations (approximately 9.8 nM for p300) (Rubio et al., 2023). This class of compounds has been previously used in cancer research to modulate histone acetylation, thereby altering enhancer activity and oncogene-driven transcription programs. More broadly, such inhibitors have been employed in preclinical studies to explore epigenetic pathways that underpin aberrant gene expression programs in various diseases, and increasingly their potential has been extended to fibrotic disorders through the concept of repurposing agents targeting epigenetic dysregulation (Rubio et al., 2019; Crawford et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
A-485’s therapeutic history is predominantly rooted in preclinical oncology research where its capacity to inhibit the enzymatic activity of CBP/p300 was shown to diminish histone acetylation marks such as H3K27ac, resulting in the downregulation of key proliferative and survival pathways including those involving c-Myc and androgen receptor targets (Lasko et al., 2017; Rubio et al., 2023). Preclinical studies have demonstrated its ability to reduce tumor growth in xenograft models such as those of prostate cancer, and it has also been evaluated in the context of other malignancies where aberrant CBP/p300 activity contributes to disease progression (Crawford et al., 2023; McKinsey et al., 2018). Although A-485 has not yet been evaluated in clinical trials for cancer and there is limited direct clinical translation data available, its mechanism of reducing histone acetylation has provided strong proof-of-concept in several in vitro and animal models. Importantly, in fibrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), hyperactive p300 has been implicated in promoting excessive extracellular matrix production, fibroblast activation, and myofibroblast differentiation (Rubio et al., 2019). Studies using the inhibition of p300 in lung fibrosis models have shown that interfering with its catalytic activity can reduce hallmark features of fibrosis, including diminished collagen deposition and lowered expression of profibrotic markers. Hence, while A-485’s historical application has primarily focused on cancer, the underlying biology of CBP/p300 in regulating fibrotic gene expression supports the rationale for repurposing A-485 for IPF (Rubio et al., 2019; Rubio et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
A-485 functions by directly interacting with the catalytic domain of CBP/p300, competitively inhibiting the binding of acetyl-CoA, which is necessary for the acetylation of lysine residues on histone tails and non-histone proteins. This inhibition prevents the acetylation of histones such as H3K27 and H3K18, leading to a more closed chromatin structure and subsequent transcriptional repression of gene expression (Rubio et al., 2023; Crawford et al., 2023). Mechanistically, in the context of fibrosis, CBP/p300 are critical coactivators of TGF-β/SMAD pathways as well as MRTF-A/SRF signaling; both pathways converge to upregulate profibrotic genes including ACTA2 (encoding alpha-smooth muscle actin, αSMA) and various collagen genes. A-485 by blocking the HAT activity of CBP/p300 can thereby hinder the acetylation-dependent activation of transcription factors such as SMAD3 and MRTF-A, which are key drivers of fibroblast activation and myofibroblast differentiation (Rubio et al., 2023; Tao et al., 2018). Furthermore, experimental data in preclinical models of fibrosis have shown that inhibition of EP300 can restore nuclear HDAC activity, which is compromised in IPF fibroblasts, thus rebalancing the acetylation/deacetylation equilibrium and promoting the re-silencing of aberrantly activated fibrotic genes (Rubio et al., 2019). In addition to modulating histone acetylation, A-485 may also affect the acetylation status of non-histone proteins including transcription factors and co-regulators that participate in the assembly of enhancer complexes critical for sustaining the profibrotic transcriptional program.

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the expected effect of A-485 in an IPF assay would be a significant reduction in the acetylation of key histones and transcription factors that drive profibrotic gene expression. Specifically, in fibroblast assays using 3D collagen gels, A-485 is anticipated to reduce the transcriptional activation of genes such as ACTA2, thereby lowering the expression levels of αSMA, which is a marker of myofibroblast differentiation. The inhibition of p300-mediated acetylation is expected to disrupt the TGF-β/SMAD signaling cascade, ultimately leading to reduced fibroblast contraction and a decrease in extracellular matrix deposition. Supporting evidence comes from experiments showing that EP300 inhibition, in general, leads to decreased collagen deposition, lower fibrotic scores, and reduced expression of profibrotic markers in preclinical models of lung fibrosis (Rubio et al., 2019; Rubio et al., 2023). Moreover, the effect of A-485 on reactivating nuclear HDAC activity may further contribute to reinstating a more quiescent chromatin state, thus repressing genes that are otherwise upregulated in IPF. Since CBP/p300 are also implicated in chemoattractant signaling and fibroblast proliferation, their inhibition should also mitigate the paracrine activation of fibroblasts, contributing to an overall antifibrotic phenotype observed in 3D contraction assays and in vivo models of pulmonary fibrosis (Sehgal et al., 2022; Rubio et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
A-485 presents a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis due to its well-characterized mechanism as a highly selective inhibitor of CBP/p300 histone acetyltransferase activity. One of the main strengths of A-485 is its ability to directly target epigenetic regulators that function as key molecular integrators in profibrotic transcriptional programs. Given that CBP/p300 coactivates TGF-β/SMAD and MRTF-A signaling pathways, which are critical for the induction of fibrotic genes, A-485’s potent catalytic inhibition (with IC50 values in the nanomolar range) suggests that even low doses could achieve significant modulation of these pathways (Rubio et al., 2023; Crawford et al., 2023). Additionally, preclinical studies in various fibrotic models, including lung, cardiac, and hepatic fibrosis, have demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of EP300 can lead to decreased collagen deposition and attenuated fibrotic endpoints (Rubio et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2023). This establishes a strong mechanistic rationale for testing A-485 in IPF, where current treatments only slow progression without reversing the fibrotic process.

However, despite these promising features, there are notable weaknesses and challenges that must be addressed before A-485 can be advanced as an IPF therapeutic candidate. First, while its efficacy in cancer models and preclinical fibrotic assays has been encouraging, there is a lack of direct clinical data on its use in IPF or other fibrotic diseases. The safety profile, pharmacokinetics, and potential off-target effects of inhibiting a ubiquitous epigenetic regulator like CBP/p300 require careful evaluation. Given the pleiotropic roles of CBP/p300 in normal cellular homeostasis—including their involvement in stem cell differentiation, immune regulation, and tissue repair—systemic inhibition may carry risks of adverse events that have yet to be fully characterized (Rubio et al., 2023; Katavolos et al., 2020). Additionally, while the rebalancing of acetylation states in fibrotic cells is desirable, there is a possibility that broad epigenetic modulation may result in unintended suppression of genes critical for normal cellular functions, raising concerns regarding long-term safety and tolerability.

In summary, the strengths of A-485 for the treatment of IPF lie in its potent and selective inhibition of the CBP/p300 HAT domain, its ability to block key profibrotic transcriptional programs through modulation of acetylation-dependent activation of SMAD3 and MRTF-A, and the supportive preclinical data in fibrotic models. Its design as an epigenetic modulator that can reduce αSMA expression and fibroblast contraction in 3D models provides a strong mechanistic basis for its antifibrotic potential. On the other hand, the weaknesses include the current lack of direct clinical evidence in IPF, the potential for adverse effects due to the broad roles of CBP/p300 in normal physiology, and the need to thoroughly characterize its pharmacokinetic profile and safety in the context of chronic fibrotic diseases. Overall, A-485 represents a highly promising candidate for repurposing as an IPF therapeutic; however, additional detailed preclinical studies focusing on lung fibrosis models, comprehensive toxicology assessments, and eventual early-phase clinical trials in IPF patients will be essential to determine its feasibility and therapeutic index in this new context (Rubio et al., 2019; Rubio et al., 2023; Sehgal et al., 2022; Crawford et al., 2023).
