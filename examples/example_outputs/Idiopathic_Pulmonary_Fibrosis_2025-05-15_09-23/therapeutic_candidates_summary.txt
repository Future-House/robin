Hypothesis: Galunisertib, a selective small‐molecule inhibitor of TGF-β receptor I kinase, will mitigate IPF by blocking TGF-β1‐induced SMAD2/3 phosphorylation in lung fibroblasts, preventing αSMA upregulation, myofibroblast differentiation, and 3D collagen gel contraction.
Reasoning: Canonical TGF-β/SMAD signaling is a validated driver of fibrosis; genetic SMAD3 knockout protects against bleomycin fibrosis. Galunisertib has shown potent SMAD2/3 blockade, reduced collagen I expression in primary human fibroblasts, and prophylactic efficacy in murine lung-fibrosis models. Its oral bioavailability and phase II oncology safety data support feasibility. Mechanistic specificity for the TGF-β axis and evidence of fibroblast contractility reduction underpin its novel repurposing for IPF.

Reasoning: αvβ6 integrin selectively activates TGF-β in fibrotic niches; blockade reduces fibrosis in ex vivo PCLS and bleomycin models. GSK3008348 binds αvβ6 with high affinity, inhibits fibroblast contraction in 3D assays, and exhibits favorable inhalation PK and safety in phase I trials. Its cell‐surface target specificity confers low off‐target risk.

Therapeutic Candidate 9:
Candidate: Vorinostat (SAHA, Selleckchem S1047)
Hypothesis: Vorinostat, a pan‐HDAC inhibitor, will inhibit IPF by increasing histone acetylation, reactivating antifibrotic genes (e.g., FAS, COX2), reducing αSMA transcription, and suppressing fibroblast contractility in 3D collagen gels.
