Optimizing cell culture assays for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) hinges on fine‐tuning several interconnected variables to best recapitulate the in vivo lung microenvironment. First, media components are critical. Using serum-free or chemically defined media minimizes batch variability and prevents the introduction of undefined serum factors, thereby allowing precise manipulation of growth factor levels and signaling cues to guide cell differentiation and phenotype maintenance (schruf2020recapitulatingaspectsof pages 27-30). Consequently, defined media can better mimic the lung environment by exactly replicating essential nutrient and hormone profiles compared with serum-containing media (schruf2020recapitulatingaspectsof pages 16-18).

The dosing and kinetics of TGF-β, the principal pro-fibrotic cytokine, are equally important. TGF-β dosing must be carefully titrated: too high a concentration may lead to cytotoxic effects while insufficient dosing may fail to trigger fibrotic responses. Precise temporal control is required to mirror the dynamic TGF-β signaling seen in IPF, as TGF-β also serves as a coordinator of downstream pro-fibrotic events (schruf2020recapitulatingaspectsof pages 27-30). Furthermore, cytokine cocktails that include additional pro-fibrotic mediators such as IL-13, TNF-α, IL-1β, and others have been developed to better simulate the complex cytokine milieu present in IPF patients. These cocktails demonstrate that no single cytokine triggers all fibrotic pathways; rather, a combination more effectively induces transitions such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and airway-like cell phenotypes, thereby increasing the physiological relevancy of the model (schruf2020recapitulatingaspectsof pages 82-84).

Oxygen tension modulation adds another layer of complexity to these models. The lung is a low-oxygen environment relative to standard atmospheric conditions, and maintaining physiologically relevant oxygen levels (typically in the range of 3–8% O₂) can have a profound effect on cell behavior, potentially influencing both differentiation outcomes and pro-fibrotic responses. While specific oxygen tension values are not always delineated, controlling this parameter is recognized as essential in moderating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ensuring the cellular responses reflect in vivo conditions (schruf2020recapitulatingaspectsof pages 16-18).

Measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) is also critical, as oxidative stress is a key driver in fibrotic processes. Incorporating live-cell compatible fluorescent probes permits kinetic assessment of ROS generation during treatment with pro-fibrotic stimuli, thereby providing insights into oxidative stress–mediated signaling events (schruf2020recapitulatingaspectsof pages 60-64).

Live-cell imaging platforms are indispensable for capturing the dynamic progression of fibrosis-related cellular changes. High-resolution confocal microscopes and high-speed cameras, often coupled with image processing software such as FIJI, enable researchers to monitor markers of differentiation, apoptosis, and epithelial remodeling in real time. These platforms not only document morphological changes but also quantify cellular behaviors in response to cytokine treatments (schruf2020recapitulatingaspectsof pages 37-39).

Finally, automation and standardization strategies are crucial for transitioning these assays to a high-throughput format. Employing robotic liquid handling systems and automated image analysis pipelines—such as those implemented with platforms like the InCell 2200 Analyzer and Columbus Image Storage and Analysis system—can significantly enhance reproducibility, reduce human error, and enable large-scale screening. Such systems standardize dosing, media exchanges, and imaging acquisition, thereby ensuring robust, scalable assays suitable for compound screening and mechanistic studies (schruf2020recapitulatingaspectsof pages 39-41).

Collectively, the integration of defined media conditions, precise TGF-β and cytokine dosing regimens, oxygen tension control, sensitive ROS measurement, advanced live-cell imaging, and automated workflows creates an optimized, high-throughput assay system that robustly models IPF pathogenesis and exposes potential anti-fibrotic therapeutic targets (schruf2020recapitulatingaspectsof pages 95-97).
