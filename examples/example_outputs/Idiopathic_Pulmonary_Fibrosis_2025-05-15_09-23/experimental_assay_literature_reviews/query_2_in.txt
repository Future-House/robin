Query: In vitro models of IPF including primary human lung fibroblasts, alveolar epithelial type II cell lines, co-culture systems, organotypic alveolosphere assays, hydrogel stiffness modulation, mechanical stretch, 3D biomimetic scaffolds: protocols, advantages and limitations

Primary human lung fibroblasts are isolated directly from human lung tissue and serve as the gold standard for modeling IPF. They exhibit key fibrogenic responses such as differentiating into myofibroblasts and depositing extracellular matrix (ECM) components when exposed to pro‐fibrotic stimuli. The protocols typically involve careful isolation and maintenance under conditions that preserve their phenotype; however, donor variability, limited lifespan in culture, and senescence after few passages remain significant limitations (cooper2021atissueengineered pages 280-283, cooper2021atissueengineered pages 62-65).

Alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cell lines—commonly represented by A549 and NCI-H441 cells—offer ease of culture and an unlimited supply compared to primary cells. Protocols generally involve standard culture techniques with optimized media formulations, yet these cell lines derive from tumor tissues and may fail to fully mimic the differentiated state of primary ATII cells. Issues include poor tight junction formation, altered gene expression profiles, and limited functional marker expression (e.g., surfactant proteins), which constrain their relevance for studying normal alveolar maintenance and repair (cooper2021atissueengineered pages 280-283).

Co-culture systems integrate more than one cell type, typically combining fibroblasts with epithelial cells and sometimes immune cells, to better recapitulate the cell–cell interactions critical in IPF pathogenesis. These protocols require optimization of culture media and conditions to support the different cell types simultaneously. Advantages include enhanced physiological relevance due to epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk, which is crucial in fibrotic signaling and tissue remodeling. Nonetheless, the complexity of these systems, difficulties in standardization, and potential confounding interactions pose challenges for reproducibility and interpretation (cooper2021atissueengineered pages 62-65, dabaghi2023aroadmapfor pages 14-15).

Organotypic alveolosphere assays are advanced 3D techniques in which alveolar epithelial cells, often from progenitor populations or primary sources, are embedded within a matrix (such as Matrigel) to spontaneously form spherical, alveolar-like structures. These models enable the study of epithelial regeneration, differentiation, and self-renewal processes within a spatially relevant architecture. Advantages include a closer mimicry of in vivo alveolar structures and the ability to assess paracrine signals in a three-dimensional context. However, these assays frequently require feeder cells or additional growth factors and can suffer from reproducibility issues and a lack of full vascular or immune system components (cooper2021atissueengineered pages 62-65, joo2024advancedlungorganoids pages 14-15).

Hydrogel stiffness modulation involves culturing cells within 3D matrices fabricated from hydrogels, such as collagen type I or synthetic polymers, whose stiffness can be finely tuned. The protocols often incorporate crosslinking strategies to adjust the modulus of the gel to ranges that mimic healthy versus fibrotic lung tissue. This approach allows investigation of mechanotransduction pathways—such as TGF-β1-driven fibroblast activation—and subsequent changes in ECM deposition. Although these hydrogels provide an improved mechanobiological context, they tend to oversimplify the complex, heterogeneous mechanical properties of native lung tissue and may not fully replicate cell–cell interactions seen in vivo (dabaghi2023aroadmapfor pages 13-14, yanagihara2020currentmodelsof pages 7-8).

Mechanical stretch models subject cells to cyclic or static forces that simulate the dynamic mechanical environment of breathing. These systems generally employ flexible membranes or lung-on-a-chip devices to impose controlled deformation on cells cultured within either 2D or 3D matrices. Advantages include the ability to study the impact of dynamic mechanical forces on cell signaling, cytoskeletal reorganization, and ECM remodeling, all of which play significant roles in IPF progression. The limitations center on the technical complexity in precisely regulating stretch parameters and replicating the multi-axial stresses found in native lung tissue (cooper2021atissueengineered pages 280-283, horowitz2016towardsahuman pages 19-23).

Finally, 3D biomimetic scaffolds aim to replicate the architectural and biochemical complexity of lung ECM. These scaffolds can be derived from decellularized lung matrices or engineered using advanced fabrication techniques such as electrospinning or 3D bioprinting. Protocols focus on achieving spatial organization and tunable mechanical properties that allow for the maintenance of multiple cell types in a physiologically relevant configuration. While the advantages include enhanced cell–matrix interactions and the potential for high-fidelity disease modeling, challenges remain in achieving reproducibility, integrating vascular and immune components, and scalability for high-throughput screening (tanneberger2025biomaterialbased3dhuman pages 1-5, yanagihara2020currentmodelsof pages 6-7).

In summary, each in vitro IPF model—from primary fibroblasts to complex 3D biomimetic scaffolds—offers unique protocols, advantages, and limitations. While simpler systems provide ease of study and reproducibility, they often lack the intricate cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions observed in vivo, underscoring the need for integrative approaches to more faithfully recapitulate the multifactorial nature of pulmonary fibrosis (cooper2021atissueengineered pages 280-283, dabaghi2023aroadmapfor pages 2-3).
