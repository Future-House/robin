Query: Biomarkers and multi-omics profiling in early IPF pathogenesis: transcriptomic, proteomic, phosphoproteomic signatures in TGF-β–stimulated fibroblasts and injured alveolar epithelial cells, candidate biomarkers for phenotypic screening and target engagement in cell-based assays

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by relentless extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and tissue remodeling driven by aberrant cell signaling. Early in the disease, two key cell populations—TGF-β–stimulated fibroblasts and injured alveolar epithelial cells—exhibit distinct molecular signatures that can be captured using integrated multi-omics profiling. TGF-β, defined here as a master profibrotic cytokine activating canonical (Smad2/3) and non-canonical (MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and Rho-like GTPase) pathways, drives fibroblasts to transition into an activated myofibroblast phenotype, thereby increasing ECM secretion and remodeling (kendall2021systemicsclerosisbiomarkers pages 1-2).

Proteomic analyses of the secretome from TGF-β–stimulated primary human lung fibroblasts have revealed a specific set of differentially secreted proteins. Notable among these are ceruloplasmin (CP), vimentin (VIM), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). These proteins are implicated in inflammatory regulation and ECM modification and have been proposed as accessible candidate biomarkers in systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary fibrosis (SSc-PF) and early IPF as well (kendall2021systemicsclerosisbiomarkers pages 14-16, kendall2021systemicsclerosisbiomarkers pages 16-18). Additional proteomic studies in IPF cell lines have identified hub proteins such as ENG, THY1, and CD9. ENG, for example, functions as a co-receptor in TGF-β signaling and modulates fibroblast activation, while THY1 and CD9 influence cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization—processes critical to fibrogenesis (velazquezenriquez2022proteomicanalysisreveals pages 10-12, velazquezenriquez2022proteomicanalysisreveals pages 12-13).

Although detailed transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic datasets in TGF-β–stimulated fibroblasts are less explicitly described in these sources, emerging data strongly suggest that transcriptomic alterations accompany proteomic changes. These transcriptomic signatures predominantly involve upregulation of genes related to ECM synthesis, cytokine production, and fibrotic signaling, which are consistent with the activation of fibroblasts via TGF-β pathways (kendall2021systemicsclerosisbiomarkers pages 1-2, sarohi2022exploringthecardiac pages 11-13). Furthermore, phosphoproteomic analyses, particularly those targeting the phosphorylation status of key signaling intermediates (e.g., Smad2/3 and MAPK family members), refine our understanding of dynamic kinase activities that underlie fibroblast phenotypic changes. This integration of phosphoproteomic profiling with transcriptomic and proteomic data provides a more comprehensive view of TGF-β–mediated mechanisms in early fibrotic remodeling (sarohi2022exploringthecardiac pages 11-13).

In the injured alveolar epithelial compartment, advanced in vitro lung models—notably those employing induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–derived alveolar type II (AT2) cells—have demonstrated a consistent loss of normal epithelial markers alongside an upregulation of pro-fibrotic genes and proteins. This reprogramming mirrors the early events of epithelial injury and subsequent myofibroblast activation observed in IPF (moreira2022advancedinvitro pages 23-23, moreira2022advancedinvitro pages 28-30). Although detailed multi-omic profiles in these epithelial cells are not as extensively mapped as in fibroblasts, the changes observed support the development of candidate biomarkers reflecting epithelial dysfunction and ECM remodeling.

Moreover, integrative approaches using Bayesian network analysis in studies of extracellular vesicles have identified interconnected modules that include established serological markers such as KL-6, SP-D, and PSPB. These markers, linked to TGF-β signaling and fibrotic progression, hold potential for implementation in phenotypic screening assays and for evaluating target engagement in cell-based models (tomoto2024idiopathicpulmonaryfibrosisspecific pages 7-8, tomoto2024idiopathicpulmonaryfibrosisspecific pages 3-5).

In summary, multi-omics profiling in early IPF pathogenesis reveals a complex interplay of transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic alterations driven by TGF-β. Candidate biomarkers—including secreted proteins (CP, VIM, GAPDH, A2M, B2M), hub proteins (ENG, THY1, CD9), and serological markers (KL-6, SP-D, PSPB)—emerge as promising tools for phenotypic screening and target engagement in cell-based assays that model early fibrotic disease (kendall2021systemicsclerosisbiomarkers pages 41-41, velazquezenriquez2022proteomicanalysisreveals pages 7-10, lucchini2021epithelialcellsand pages 17-17).
