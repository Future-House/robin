Query: High-content phenotypic screening for small molecules inhibiting TGF-β-induced fibroblast contraction in 3D collagen matrices: collating evidence for target engagement, downstream SMAD-independent pathway modulation, efficacy in murine bleomycin lung fibrosis, pharmacokinetic properties, and safety evaluation

High-content phenotypic screening in 3D collagen matrices has emerged as a robust approach for identifying small molecules that inhibit TGF-β–induced fibroblast contraction by providing multifaceted readouts from target engagement to downstream pathway modulation and efficacy in vivo.

Target engagement in these platforms is demonstrated by the ability of candidate compounds to reduce the TGF-β–mediated fibrotic phenotype in 3D cultures. For example, the development of a 3D human skeletal muscle microphysiological system showed that TGF-β1 treatment induced hallmark fibrosis features (elevated ECM deposition, increased stiffness, reduced contractile force), which could be reversed by inhibitors such as Suramin and Nintedanib, evidencing direct target engagement of TGF-β signaling (Ananthakumar2022developingafibrotic pages50-56). Similarly, microscale collagen hydrogel models enable quantitative measurements of fibroblast contractility (e.g., microtissue compaction, αSMA, and F-actin expression) that directly correlate with target modulation by TGF-β and its inhibitors (Cummins2023novelmicroscalecollagen pages55-59).

Downstream SMAD-independent pathway modulation is supported by multiple studies. LXR agonists, for instance, dose-dependently blocked TGF-β–induced myofibroblast markers and inhibited actin cytoskeletal reorganization without affecting p-Smad3 levels, suggesting an alternative, SMAD-independent mode of action (Carthy2016chemicalregulatorsof pages11-12). In addition, haloperidol, identified through high-throughput screening, exerts antifibrotic effects by binding to sigma receptor 1. This binding leads to changes in intracellular calcium and a moderate endoplasmic reticulum stress response that culminates in the inhibition of Notch signaling, thereby reducing myofibroblast contraction independent of the canonical TGF-β/SMAD pathway (Rehman2019highthroughputscreeningdiscovers pages1-2, pages10-12).

Efficacy in murine bleomycin lung fibrosis models has been demonstrated using advanced molecular inhibitors, solidifying the translational relevance of these findings. For example, dual inhibition of integrins αvβ6 and αvβ1 with the compound PLN-74809 produced dose-dependent reductions in pulmonary Smad3 phosphorylation and collagen deposition in bleomycin-challenged mice (Decaris2021dualinhibitionof pages9-11). Furthermore, the novel multikinase inhibitor SKLB-YTH-60 attenuated fibrotic changes and modulated FGFR and TGF-β/Smad-dependent pathways in the same bleomycin model, supporting its antifibrotic efficacy (Liu2021anovelmultikinase pages1-2).

Pharmacokinetic properties and safety evaluations have been integrated into these studies to ensure clinical translational potential. Detailed pharmacokinetic analyses in murine models demonstrated exposure-dependent inhibition of TGF-β activation, with acceptable oral bioavailability and half-life reported for compounds such as SKLB-YTH-60 (Liu2021anovelmultikinase pages1-2). Concurrently, dual integrin inhibitors were shown to induce significant target engagement in bleomycin models with supportive PK data, while also comparing favorably to standard-of-care drugs in terms of dosing and efficacy (Decaris2021dualinhibitionof pages9-11). Although direct safety evaluation in the 3D in vitro systems is less elaborated, the consistency with approved drugs such as nintedanib and pirfenidone and the absence of toxicity in in vivo models lends promising support to the overall safety profile (Cummins2023novelmicroscalecollagen pages59-63).

In summary, high-content phenotypic screening using 3D collagen matrices effectively collates evidence across direct target engagement, modulation of both SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent pathways, demonstrated in vivo efficacy in murine bleomycin lung fibrosis models, and favorable pharmacokinetics with promising safety evaluations. This integrated approach offers a powerful preclinical platform for the discovery and optimization of antifibrotic therapeutics (Ananthakumar2022developingafibrotic pages50-56, Carthy2016chemicalregulatorsof pages11-12, Decaris2021dualinhibitionof pages9-11, Liu2021anovelmultikinase pages1-2, Cummins2023novelmicroscalecollagen pages55-59).
