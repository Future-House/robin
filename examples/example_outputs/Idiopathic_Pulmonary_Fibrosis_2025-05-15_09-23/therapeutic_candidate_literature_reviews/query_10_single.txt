Query: Single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of fibroblast subpopulations in IPF lungs to identify hypercontractile myofibroblast clusters: discovery of subtype-specific targets, functional validation in 3D contraction assays, and candidate small-molecule modulators

The recent approach of employing single‐cell transcriptomic and proteomic profiling in IPF lungs is aimed at dissecting the complex heterogeneity of lung fibroblasts. By stratifying fibroblast subpopulations at single‐cell resolution, researchers can identify specific molecular signatures that underscore the functional and phenotypic differences among cells. This strategy is particularly powerful for detecting hypercontractile myofibroblast clusters that are implicated in the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (wang2018datadrivenapproachesto pages 21-26).

The initial step involves the isolation of individual lung cells for single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐Seq) and complementary proteomic analyses. In the studies described, unsupervised clustering pipelines were used to resolve distinct fibroblast populations, including matrix fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and proliferative fibroblast subtypes. Specific gene modules related to extracellular matrix remodeling, contractile function, and cell cycle processes are identified as key markers for these distinct cell types (wang2018datadrivenapproachesto pages 30-36, wang2018datadrivenapproachesto pages 36-48). In particular, certain gene signatures illustrate upregulation of contractile proteins and signaling pathways—markers that can delineate hypercontractile myofibroblast clusters from other fibroblast subsets.

Complementing the transcriptomic data, proteomic profiling is critical for validating the presence and function of these subtype-specific proteins. Although proteomic studies in this context remain limited in the clinical trial domain, the referenced literature provides evidence of compartment-resolved proteomic analysis of lung injury and repair, which supports the identification of differential protein expression patterns among fibroblast subpopulations (wang2018datadrivenapproachesto pages 125-128, OpenTargets Search: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis). By integrating these proteomic data with transcriptomic profiles, one can achieve a robust molecular characterization of fibroblast heterogeneity in IPF.

Functional validation is then performed using three-dimensional (3D) contraction assays. Such assays measure the contractile behavior of isolated fibroblast subpopulations and are imperative for confirming that certain clusters, particularly hypercontractile myofibroblasts, exhibit enhanced contractile properties in vitro. The application of 3D contraction assays bridges the gap between molecular profiling and functional phenotype, ensuring that the identified subtype-specific targets are indeed mechanistically linked to the pathobiology of IPF (wang2018datadrivenapproachesto pages 21-26, wang2018datadrivenapproachesto pages 55-61).

Parallel to the functional assays, computational and in silico drug repositioning strategies have been employed to prioritize candidate small-molecule modulators. By leveraging gene expression connectivity mapping, the studies identified compounds—such as kinase inhibitors and other modulators known to target fibrotic pathways—that could preferentially affect hypercontractile myofibroblast clusters (wang2018datadrivenapproachesto pages 120-125). These small molecules are subsequently tested in the functional 3D contraction assays to validate their ability to modulate fibroblast contractility. The integration of transcriptomic, proteomic, and pharmacological data thus facilitates the discovery of precise, subtype-specific therapeutic targets and candidate drugs that may attenuate or reverse the fibrotic remodeling seen in IPF (wang2018datadrivenapproachesto pages 134-135).

In summary, a multifaceted, data-driven approach combining single-cell transcriptomics with proteomic profiling allows for comprehensive mapping of fibroblast heterogeneity in IPF lungs. By identifying hypercontractile myofibroblast clusters through distinct molecular biomarkers and validating these findings with 3D contraction assays, researchers are poised to exploit subtype-specific targets. This integrated method further enables the discovery and experimental testing of small-molecule modulators that could offer novel therapeutic interventions for IPF (Clinical Trials Search: fibroblast subpopulations AND idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis AND single-cell AND proteomic, wang2018datadrivenapproachesto pages 125-128, OpenTargets Search: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis).
