Query: Role of extracellular matrix stiffness and mechanotransduction in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis progression: evidence from tunable hydrogel stiffness assays, 3D collagen matrices, LOX/LOXL enzyme crosslinking studies; identification of specific mechano-enzymes as therapeutic targets

Extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and mechanotransduction play central roles in the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) by establishing a pathological feedback loop that enhances fibroblast activation and myofibroblast persistence. Experimental evidence from tunable hydrogel stiffness assays and 3D collagen matrices demonstrates that increased matrix rigidity drives fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and myofibroblast differentiation via mechanotransductive signaling pathways. Specifically, fibroblasts cultured on stiff matrices upregulate profibrotic markers such as α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen type I (Col1a1) and signal through pathways involving ROCK, YAP/TAZ, and MKL1, which coordinate gene expression changes that underpin fibrogenesis (guo2022extracellularmatrixstiffness pages 3-4, upagupta2019investigatingtheextracellular pages 98-108).

Tunable hydrogels engineered to recapitulate the stiffness range of fibrotic lung tissue have provided crucial insights into how dimensionality influences cell behavior. In 2D cultures, increased stiffness correlates with enhanced myofibroblast differentiation and proliferation, whereas in 3D hydrogel systems, similar stiffness conditions may inhibit these features, highlighting the importance of spatial context and matrix architecture in mechanotransduction (matera2020microengineered3dpulmonary pages 4-7). Moreover, ECM derived from decellularized lung scaffolds typically retains the complex mechanical and structural cues of native and fibrotic tissues, thereby reinforcing the concept that ECM composition and stiffness can independently modulate fibroblast phenotype (upagupta2019investigatingtheextracellular pages 88-93).

A key determinant of increased lung stiffness in IPF is the enzymatic crosslinking of collagen and elastin fibers mediated by the lysyl oxidase (LOX) family of enzymes, including LOX and LOXL1-4. These copper-dependent amine oxidases catalyze the oxidative deamination of lysine residues, leading to the formation of reactive aldehydes that covalently crosslink ECM proteins. Such crosslinking not only stiffens the tissue but also renders collagen resistant to degradation, thereby perpetuating the fibrotic state through sustained mechanotransductive signaling. Histological and experimental studies have shown that LOX and LOXL2, in particular, are upregulated in IPF, with both genetic ablation in animal models and pharmacological inhibition resulting in reduced collagen crosslinking, decreased matrix stiffness, and amelioration of fibrotic progression (guo2022extracellularmatrixstiffness pages 14-15, burgstaller2017theinstructiveextracellular pages 6-7).

Further studies using advanced engineered matrices such as 3D collagen constructs have underscored the importance of LOX/LOXL enzymes in modulating ECM mechanical properties. These systems allow for the manipulation of enzyme-mediated crosslinking activity and provide a platform to dissect the downstream mechanotransduction pathways driven by stiffening. Indeed, increased LOX activity has been directly linked to enhanced activation of key mechanosensitive pathways, including the ROCK/actin/MKL1 axis and the nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ, which in turn promote fibrosis by upregulating profibrotic cytokines and matrix proteins (guo2022extracellularmatrixstiffness pages 19-20, guo2022extracellularmatrixstiffness pages 32-34, upagupta2019investigatingtheextracellular pages 44-48).

In summary, the integration of tunable hydrogel stiffness assays, 3D collagen matrices, and LOX/LOXL enzyme crosslinking studies provides compelling evidence that the mechanical properties of the ECM are not merely passive consequences of fibrotic remodeling but are active drivers of disease progression in IPF. Mechano-enzymes—specifically LOX and LOXL2—emerge as promising therapeutic targets, as their inhibition shows potential for normalizing collagen fibrillogenesis, reducing tissue stiffness, and ultimately disrupting the pathological mechanotransduction loop that sustains lung fibrosis (upagupta2019investigatingtheextracellular pages 48-52, OpenTargets Search: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis).
