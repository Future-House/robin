Query: Comprehensive review of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis pathophysiology emphasizing molecular drivers of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix remodeling: collate genetic, epigenetic, and functional studies on TGF-β, Wnt, PDGF, integrin signaling in patient lung biopsies and animal models

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a complex disease in which genetic predispositions, epigenetic modifications, and functional signaling converge to drive sustained fibroblast activation and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. At the core of these processes are aberrant signaling pathways mediated by transforming growth factor‐β (TGF-β), Wnt, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and integrin interactions.

TGF-β is widely recognized as the central pro-fibrotic cytokine. Genetic studies indicate that variations in genes regulating TGF-β signaling, as well as environmental stressors, set the stage for maladaptive repair in susceptible individuals (brereton2021determinantsandeffects pages 45-48, llobell2019muc1bioactivationcontributes pages 38-41). Functionally, TGF-β activates both canonical Smad-dependent and non–Smad pathways that stimulate fibroblast proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation, and increased collagen synthesis. This pathway also induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), further expanding the myofibroblast population and reinforcing ECM production, as demonstrated in both patient lung biopsies and animal models (ma2022researchprogressin pages 1-2, sgalla2018idiopathicpulmonaryfibrosis pages 3-4).

Wnt signaling, while less intensively studied than TGF-β, is emerging as a critical regulator of cell fate decisions and epithelial cell plasticity. Aberrant activation of both canonical (β-catenin mediated) and non-canonical Wnt pathways plays a role in the dysregulation of alveolar epithelial cells. This subsequently contributes to fibroblast activation and ECM remodeling. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from patient samples have revealed that specific subsets of epithelial cells with elevated expression of airway-associated genes may engage Wnt pathways, thereby sustaining a pro-fibrotic microenvironment (yao2024dysregulatedbidirectionalepithelial–mesenchymal pages 10-12, sandbo2018mechanismsoffibrosis pages 29-31).

PDGF signaling is another critical axis in the fibroproliferative process. Genetic and functional studies have highlighted elevated PDGF ligands and receptors (including PDGFRA) as mediators of fibroblast proliferation, migration, and survival. Activation of PDGF receptors initiates downstream cascades such as MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways that promote collagen synthesis and maintain fibroblast viability. Evidence from animal models—particularly bleomycin-induced fibrosis—and human lung tissue analyses underscores PDGF’s role in expanding fibroblast populations in the fibrotic niche (brereton2021determinantsandeffects pages 37-39, ma2022researchprogressin pages 21-21).

Integrin signaling provides a critical mechanistic link between the extracellular matrix and cell surface receptors. Integrins, notably the αvβ6 heterodimer, mediate the activation of latent TGF-β, thereby perpetuating fibrotic signaling. On binding to ECM components, these integrins activate downstream effectors such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which further amplify the fibroblast activation and ECM deposition cascades. Studies in both patient biopsies and preclinical animal models demonstrate that integrin-mediated activation of TGF-β is essential for the development and persistence of fibrosis (murgo2024characterizationandevaluation pages 14-17, zhou2024currentstateof pages 5-6).

Epigenetically, IPF is characterized by altered microRNA profiles, dysfunctional DNA methylation patterns, and aberrant histone modifications that collectively modulate the expression of key genes within these signaling cascades. Such modifications underlie the persistence of a pro-fibrotic phenotype even when the initial epithelial injury resolves. Functional analyses of patient lung tissues consistently reveal that these epigenetic changes correlate with dysregulated TGF-β and Wnt signatures, thereby reinforcing and sustaining fibroblast activation and ECM remodeling (samarelli2021dissectingtherole pages 2-3, sgalla2018idiopathicpulmonaryfibrosis pages 3-4).

Together, these integrated genetic, epigenetic, and functional studies from patient lung biopsies and animal models converge on a picture in which maladaptive signaling through TGF-β, Wnt, PDGF, and integrin pathways leads to the relentless activation of fibroblasts and deposition of ECM. This multifactorial molecular framework not only elucidates IPF pathogenesis but also provides a compelling rationale for targeting these pathways therapeutically to disrupt the fibrotic process and improve clinical outcomes (ma2022targetinggrowthfactor pages 1-2, murgo2024characterizationandevaluation pages 11-14).
