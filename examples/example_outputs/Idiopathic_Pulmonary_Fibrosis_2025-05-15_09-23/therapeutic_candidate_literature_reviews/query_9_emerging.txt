Query: Emerging profibrotic mediators beyond TGF-β in IPF, such as PDGF, CTGF, IL-11 and their receptors: pathophysiological evidence, target validation, and small-molecule inhibitors or neutralizing agents assessed for inhibition of fibroblast-driven 3D matrix contraction and lung fibrosis

Platelet‐derived growth factor (PDGF), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and interleukin‐11 (IL-11) have emerged as key mediators in the pathophysiology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), operating in concert with or downstream of transforming growth factor‐β (TGF-β) signaling. Although TGF-β remains the principal driver of fibrosis, these additional mediators provide further targets for therapeutic intervention, particularly through direct inhibition strategies aimed at reducing fibroblast proliferation, migration, and the subsequent extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition.

PDGF and its receptors PDGFRA and PDGFRB are supported by robust clinical and experimental evidence as central profibrotic drivers. PDGF signaling stimulates fibroblast proliferation and migration—a function directly implicated in fibroblast-driven 3D matrix contraction. The clinical validation for targeting PDGF receptors is underscored by the approved small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib, which simultaneously targets PDGFRB, PDGFRA, and other receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., FGFRs and VEGFRs) and has undergone extensive phase III–IV clinical trials in IPF patients (OpenTargets Search: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis-PDGF,CTGF,IL11). This strong preclinical and clinical evidence confirms that inhibition of PDGF signaling can suppress fibroblast activity, reducing matrix contraction and the progressive stiffening characteristic of fibrotic lung disease (paish2022developmentofhuman pages 97-100, jenkins2022targetingcancerassociatedfibroblasts pages 49-53).

CTGF acts as a potent downstream mediator that amplifies fibrotic signaling. Often induced by TGF-β1, CTGF promotes fibroblast differentiation, ECM production, and integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Experimental studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of CTGF correlate with enhanced fibrosis in both patient samples and animal models (OpenTargets Search: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis-PDGF,CTGF,IL11). Furthermore, the use of neutralizing antibodies, notably pamrevlumab, has shown therapeutic promise by significantly reducing fibroblast-driven matrix contraction and deposition in preclinical models and ongoing phase III clinical assessments (paish2022developmentofhuman pages 103-108, antanaviciute2023investigatingtheeffects pages 125-128). Despite some clinical trial challenges, the cumulative evidence supports CTGF as a validated target in pulmonary fibrosis.

IL-11, though emerging later in the research timeline, is increasingly recognized for its contributory role in fibrotic diseases, including IPF. IL-11 facilitates a profibrotic phenotype by promoting fibroblast activation and survival via non-canonical signaling pathways, such as ERK phosphorylation, rather than classical STAT-dependent mechanisms. Although association scores for IL-11 on platforms like Open Targets are lower compared to PDGF and CTGF (OpenTargets Search: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis-PDGF,CTGF,IL11), preclinical studies have confirmed that IL-11 is up-regulated in fibrotic tissues and that its inhibition—using neutralizing antibodies or genetic deletion approaches—can attenuate fibroblast activation and reduce collagen deposition (paish2022developmentofhuman pages 87-90, antanaviciute2023investigatingtheeffects pages 27-31). Clinical investigations, such as the pilot study assessing IL-11 levels in exhaled breath condensate and blood (NCT05536375), further validate the translational potential of IL-11 as a therapeutic target by establishing its pathophysiological relevance in lung fibrosis.

In the context of fibroblast-driven 3D matrix contraction, these mediators contribute both directly and indirectly. PDGF signaling promotes fibroblast proliferation and migration, a key initial step in matrix contraction and subsequent fibrotic remodeling. CTGF, functioning downstream of TGF-β1, not only amplifies fibrotic signaling cascades but also reinforces an autocrine feedback loop that sustains fibroblast activation. IL-11 enhances profibrotic translation mechanisms that contribute to the excessive deposition and stiffening of the ECM. Collectively, these mediators represent promising targets for small-molecule inhibitors and neutralizing agents, with nintedanib already serving as clinical proof-of-concept for PDGF receptor inhibition, while anti-CTGF and IL-11-targeted therapies continue to advance in preclinical validation and early clinical testing (paish2022developmentofhuman pages 87-90, NCT05536375).

Thus, beyond TGF-β, PDGF, CTGF, and IL-11, along with their receptors, constitute a multifaceted network of profibrotic signals. Their inhibition offers a strategic avenue to dampen fibroblast-driven matrix contraction and mitigate lung fibrosis progression in IPF, underpinning the rationale for continued development of targeted therapeutic interventions (OpenTargets Search: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis-PDGF,CTGF,IL11, paish2022developmentofhuman pages 97-100, antanaviciute2023investigatingtheeffects pages 125-128).
