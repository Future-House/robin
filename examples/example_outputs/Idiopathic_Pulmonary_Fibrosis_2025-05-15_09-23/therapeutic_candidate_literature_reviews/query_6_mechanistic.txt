Query: Mechanistic studies on TGF-β signaling in IPF fibroblasts: downstream SMAD and non-SMAD pathways, cross-talk with mechanotransduction, genetic loss-of-function validation, and small-molecule inhibitors tested in 3D collagen contraction assays and relevant in vivo fibrotic lung models

TGF-β1 acts as the principal initiator of fibrotic signaling in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) fibroblasts. Mechanistically, TGF-β1 binds to its receptor complex, triggering phosphorylation of receptor-activated SMADs (R-SMADs), notably SMAD2 and SMAD3. These phosphorylated SMADs then form complexes with SMAD4, the common-mediator SMAD, and translocate into the nucleus where they orchestrate the transcription of numerous pro‐fibrotic genes. This cascade leads to enhanced extracellular matrix synthesis, collagen deposition, and the activation of myofibroblasts, which are hallmark features in the development of fibrosis (OpenTargets Search: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis-TGFB1,SMAD2,SMAD3,SMAD4,SMAD7).

In addition to the canonical SMAD pathway, TGF-β1 also signals through non-SMAD pathways. Although the details of these non-SMAD cascades remain less well defined in the available data, they are understood to cooperate with the SMAD pathway to promote fibroblast proliferation, migration, and differentiation—further contributing to the fibrotic process. This interplay suggests a complex network wherein both SMAD-dependent and independent routes are active in IPF fibroblasts (OpenTargets Search: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis-TGFB1,SMAD2,SMAD3,SMAD4,SMAD7).

The role of mechanotransduction in IPF further complicates this signaling landscape. Fibrotic lung tissue exhibits altered mechanical properties, such as increased matrix stiffness, which can modulate cell behavior. There is emerging evidence that mechanical cues from the extracellular matrix can cross-talk with TGF-β1 signaling pathways. This mechanotransduction may amplify TGF-β1-driven responses by enhancing SMAD activation and ECM production, thereby sustaining the fibrotic phenotype. Although explicit mechanistic details on the molecular cross-talk remain limited, the convergence of these signaling domains is considered a critical aspect of disease progression (OpenTargets Search: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis-TGFB1,SMAD2,SMAD3,SMAD4,SMAD7).

Genetic loss-of-function studies have contributed significantly to validating the central role of SMAD3 in fibrosis. Animal models in which SMAD3 is deleted or functionally impaired show marked resistance to the development of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. This genetic evidence firmly establishes SMAD3 as a key mediator of TGF-β1’s pro-fibrotic signaling in the lung, and it underscores the potential efficacy of strategies aimed at specifically disrupting SMAD3 function (Clinical Trial Search: TGF-β AND (IPF OR idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis)).

Pharmacologically, small-molecule inhibitors targeting the TGF-β/SMAD axis have been evaluated in both 3D collagen contraction assays and in relevant in vivo fibrotic lung models. For example, low-dose paclitaxel has been reported to mitigate pulmonary fibrosis by suppressing TGF-β1/SMAD3 signaling. It achieves this by upregulating microRNA-140, which leads to a reversal of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a decrease in the expression of fibrotic markers. Similarly, polydatin has demonstrated the capability to block the TGF-β1/SMAD pathway, reduce inflammation, and inhibit EMT, thus contributing to the amelioration of fibrosis in bleomycin-induced models. Additionally, modulation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) has been investigated as an alternative means to negatively regulate TGF-β1-mediated SMAD signaling, presenting another potential therapeutic target. These studies, employing both in vitro colony contraction assays and in vivo models, provide robust preclinical validation for targeting the TGF-β1/SMAD pathway in IPF fibroblasts (OpenTargets Search: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis-TGFB1,SMAD2,SMAD3,SMAD4,SMAD7, Clinical Trial Search: TGF-β AND (IPF OR idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis)).
