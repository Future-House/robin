Query: Investigation of small molecule inhibitors targeting fibroblast mechanotransduction pathways such as integrin–FAK and YAP/TAZ tested in 3D collagen contraction assays in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis models: include target validation, functional mechanistic studies, in vivo efficacy, ADME and toxicity data

Research into small molecule inhibitors targeting fibroblast mechanotransduction in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has focused on two critical signaling nodes: the integrin–focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway and the YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivators. Although direct clinical trial evidence utilizing 3D collagen contraction assays is lacking (Clinical Trials Search: 3D collagen contraction assay AND (integrin OR FAK OR YAP OR TAZ) AND idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), extensive preclinical work supports the target validation, functional mechanistic modulation, in vivo efficacy, and preliminary ADME/toxicity insights for these therapeutic strategies.

Target validation arises from multiple independent observations. Integrin-mediated signaling and subsequent FAK activation are well established as central to mechanotransduction—a process whereby fibroblasts sense extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and translate mechanical cues into profibrotic gene expression and cytoskeletal remodeling (Freeberg2021mechanicalfeedforwardloops pages 5-7, Tschumperlin2020mechanotherapeuticstargetingmechanical pages 4-5). Concomitantly, the YAP/TAZ signaling axis is activated upon increased ECM stiffness, promoting fibroblast differentiation, upregulation of glycolytic enzymes, and increased production of extracellular matrix proteins (Papavassiliou2024yaptazsignalingin pages 5-7, Yang2021mechanosensitiveregulationof pages 14-16). Preclinical studies frequently use in vitro 3D collagen contraction assays as a functional readout to simulate fibroblast-mediated tissue contractility and ECM remodeling, further validating these targets (Mascharak2024modellingandtargeting pages 27-28, Tschumperlin2020mechanotherapeuticstargetingmechanical pages 4-5).

In terms of functional mechanistic studies, several small molecule inhibitors have been investigated. For example, dopamine receptor D1 agonists like dihydrexidine elevate intracellular cAMP and induce YAP phosphorylation at Ser127, which results in the cytoplasmic retention and degradation of YAP/TAZ; this shift is closely correlated with reduced fibroblast contractility in vitro and decreased profibrotic gene expression (Papavassiliou2024yaptazsignalingin pages 7-8, Freeberg2021mechanicalfeedforwardloops pages 7-10). Similarly, statins such as simvastatin appear to modulate YAP/TAZ localization, correlating with antifibrotic effects in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis models. Additional compounds including melatonin, icariin, and the prostacyclin receptor agonist ACT-333679 have been shown to modulate these mechanotransduction pathways, with mechanistic studies employing 3D contraction platforms to assess their impact on fibroblast activation and ECM remodeling (Papavassiliou2024yaptazsignalingin pages 8-10, Mascharak2024modellingandtargeting pages 41-42).

Regarding in vivo efficacy, a number of preclinical animal studies—primarily using bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis models—demonstrate that modulation of either the integrin–FAK or YAP/TAZ axes results in attenuation or reversal of fibrotic pathology. Notably, compounds targeting these pathways reduce myofibroblast activation, ECM deposition, and overall lung stiffness in animal models (Freeberg2021mechanicalfeedforwardloops pages 15-17, Upagupta2019investigatingtheextracellular pages 44-48). These results lend strong translational support to the concept that inhibiting mechanotransduction in fibroblasts can alter disease progression in IPF.

ADME and toxicity profiles, while not extensively detailed in the provided excerpts, draw cautious optimism from the use of compounds with established safety profiles. For instance, known agents like simvastatin and selexipag, as well as FAK/ROCK inhibitors such as Defactinib and KD025, have progressed into early clinical phases in other contexts with tolerable safety and pharmacokinetics, suggesting that the mechanisms under study are compatible with acceptable ADME and toxicity profiles (Tschumperlin2020mechanotherapeuticstargetingmechanical pages 4-5, Upagupta2019investigatingtheextracellular pages 44-48). However, it is important to note that comprehensive ADME and toxicity data specifically for novel small molecules targeting integrin–FAK or YAP/TAZ in IPF—in the context of 3D collagen contraction assay validation—remain limited and warrant further investigation.

In summary, while current clinical trial registries do not yet reflect studies using 3D collagen contraction assays to evaluate these inhibitors in IPF (Clinical Trials Search: 3D collagen contraction assay AND (integrin OR FAK OR YAP OR TAZ) AND idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), the accumulated preclinical evidence provides robust target validation, mechanistic insights, and in vivo efficacy data. The translational progression of these small molecule strategies, alongside the evolving understanding of their ADME and toxicity profiles, supports their continued development as potential antifibrotic therapies (Papavassiliou2024yaptazsignalingin pages 7-8, Mascharak2024modellingandtargeting pages 27-28).
