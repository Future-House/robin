Query: Integration of genomic and proteomic biomarker studies in IPF patient-derived fibroblasts and lung tissues: mining single-cell RNA-seq, mass spectrometry datasets to identify dysregulated pathways and novel druggable proteins linked to fibrosis contractility

Integrated analyses of genomic and proteomic biomarkers in IPF have emerged as a powerful approach to disentangle the complex milieu of fibroblast activation, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and contractile dysregulation that underlie fibrosis progression. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) provides unparalleled resolution of cell state heterogeneity by classifying lung cells into discrete subpopulations, including various fibroblast subsets, while mass spectrometry‐based proteomics and spatial omics yield complementary insights into protein abundance and localization. This combined strategy enables the mining of transcriptional signatures and protein biomarkers that are directly linked to contractility mechanisms and fibrotic remodeling in patient-derived lung tissues (mayr2020integratedsinglecell pages 1-3).

The scRNA‐seq data, derived from thousands of cells across multiple cohorts, identified 45 distinct lung cell types—among which fibroblast populations, including myofibroblast and activated fibroblast states, play a central role in IPF pathogenesis—and provided the template for mapping cellular perturbations. Parallel proteomic analyses using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS), including spatial proteomics through laser capture microdissection (LCM) and high-resolution Orbitrap systems, quantified differential expression of proteins from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, plasma, and tissue sections. These approaches highlighted proteins linked to ECM organization, collagen metabolism, and actin cytoskeleton regulation, which are critical components of fibrosis-associated contractility (mayr2020asinglecell pages 48-53).

Integration of these datasets using advanced bioinformatics pipelines and machine learning algorithms allowed researchers to correlate upregulated transcriptional profiles with specific protein signatures, thereby pinpointing dysregulated pathways such as TGF-β signaling, WNT, Notch, and HIF1A cascades. In particular, the identification of markers like LTBP1 and FN1 in IPF myofibroblasts provided evidence of TGF-β–mediated activation and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition processes that contribute to enhanced contractile capabilities (wang2025novelintegrationof pages 20-21). Moreover, the differential expression of cytoskeletal regulators and ECM components suggests that alterations in actin dynamics underlie the increased cellular contractility observed in fibrotic lungs (vuljan2019idiopathicpulmonaryfibrosis pages 59-63).

Spatial omics further refined these observations by resolving cellular niches within the lung. For example, fibroblast foci, which are enriched in mesenchymal cells exhibiting contractile phenotypes, were characterized both through transcriptomic deconvolution and proteomic profiling. Data from spatial proteomics confirmed the presence of upregulated ECM proteins and actin-binding molecules specifically in these regions, supporting the notion that localized pathways controlling contractility and matrix deposition are potential druggable targets (wang2025novelintegrationof pages 10-12, wang2025novelintegrationof pages 13-15).

The integration also facilitates the cross-validation of biomarker signatures in body fluids, linking peripheral protein levels with cellular changes in the lung microenvironment. Biomarkers such as CRTAC1, previously associated with alveolar epithelial cell health, and proteins like Coro1a, correlated with fibrosis progression, exemplify the potential for developing targeted therapeutic interventions. This multi-omics strategy, by mapping dysregulated pathways and correlating gene and protein expression at single-cell resolution, not only improves our mechanistic understanding of IPF but also opens avenues for precision medicine approaches aimed at normalizing contractile dynamics and ECM remodeling in fibrotic lung tissue (mayr2021integrativeanalysisof pages 1-2, principi2023proteomicfingerprintof pages 1-2).

In summary, the integration of single-cell transcriptomic and mass spectrometry–based proteomic data provides a comprehensive framework to identify key dysregulated pathways, such as TGF-β signaling and cytoskeletal modulation, in IPF fibroblasts. By correlating cellular transcriptional states with localized protein expression, this approach highlights novel druggable targets and offers a robust methodology for advancing precision therapies in fibrotic lung diseases (sieber2023nfκbdrivesepithelialmesenchymal pages 19-19).
