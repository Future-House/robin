Query: Structure-activity relationship studies of chemical scaffolds targeting fibroblast contractility and myofibroblast differentiation: analysis of small-molecule analogues that modulate 3D matrix contraction, with confirmatory in vitro target engagement assays and in vivo pulmonary fibrosis efficacy data

Structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies in both cinnamic acid amide and Rho/MRTF/SRF inhibitor series have revealed that subtle modifications to chemical scaffolds can drastically alter their ability to modulate fibroblast contractility and myofibroblast differentiation. In the cinnamic acid amide series, lead compounds termed N23Ps were derived from Tranilast via careful SAR optimization. Key modifications – for example replacing the carboxy group at R1 with a butoxy moiety and altering methoxy substitutions on the aromatic ring – improved potency by over 100-fold, enabling effective inhibition of TGFβ1-induced extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and myofibroblast marker expression (e.g., αSMA) at concentrations as low as 10 µM as compared to the high concentrations needed for Tranilast (gerckens2023discoveryofnew pages 72-82). Concurrently, these modifications were shown to alter fibroblast morphology and contractility as visualized by live-cell imaging and immunofluorescence staining. Notably, target engagement was confirmed by demonstrating that N23Ps upregulate SMURF2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates canonical TGFβ signaling via SMAD2 degradation, since RNA interference of SMURF2 attenuated the compounds’ antifibrotic effects (gerckens2023discoveryofnew pages 88-94).

Parallel SAR efforts in the Rho/MRTF/SRF pathway inhibitors have concentrated on tuning the heterocyclic core, the aromatic substitutions, and the sidechain functionalities to modulate fibroblast contractility. Starting from initial hits such as CCG-58146, systematic analog modifications led to the development of compounds in the 1,3,4-oxadiazole thioether series – notably CCG-58150 and its more potent derivative CCG-232964. These compounds exhibit dramatic potency improvements (up to 150,000-fold increase in potency relative to the initial hit) and operate by inhibiting MRTF/SRF-dependent gene transcription, directly reducing expression of fibrotic markers such as CTGF and αSMA (kahl2019targetidentificationfor pages 114-119). The pronounced activity cliffs in these SAR studies hint at precise molecular interactions that may include covalent binding modes. In vitro target engagement is further validated in primary fibroblast models stimulated with LPA or TGFβ1, where inhibition of CTGF mRNA and other myofibroblast markers was dose-dependent (kahl2019targetidentificationfor pages 8-11).

Further, functional assays assessing 3D matrix contraction have been employed to determine the impact of these small molecules on actual fibroblast contractility. While not every report explicitly details 3D contraction assays, the disruption of stress fiber formation, reduction of fibroblast contractility and ECM deposition observed in high-content imaging and cell impedance assays are direct surrogates for matrix contraction modulation (kahl2019targetidentificationfor pages 43-48, sieber2018novelhigh–throughputmyofibroblast pages 1-2). These in vitro findings underpin the observed in vivo antifibrotic efficacy. In murine models, for instance, both cinnamic acid amides and Rho pathway inhibitors have demonstrated beneficial outcomes: Gerckens (2023) reports that N23Ps showed antifibrotic efficacy in a murine pulmonary fibrosis model, while Kahl (2019) detailed efficacy in bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis models, lending translational support to their mechanism (gerckens2023discoveryofnew pages 101-106, kahl2019targetidentificationfor pages 114-119).

In summary, these integrated SAR studies have provided detailed insights into the chemical modifications required to optimize small-molecule inhibitors for modulating fibroblast contractility and myofibroblast differentiation. This is supported by a suite of in vitro target engagement assays—from live-cell imaging and gene expression analyses to biochemical validations—and corroborated by in vivo efficacy data in relevant fibrosis models (gerckens2023discoveryofnew pages 88-94, kahl2019targetidentificationfor pages 48-54).
