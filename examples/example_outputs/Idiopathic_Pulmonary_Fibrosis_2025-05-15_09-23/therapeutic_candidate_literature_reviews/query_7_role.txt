Query: Role of integrin αvβ6, αvβ1, and mechanotransduction receptors in fibroblast activation and matrix contraction during pulmonary fibrosis: functional validation studies, integrin antagonists’ efficacy in 3D contraction assays, pharmacokinetics, and safety in preclinical IPF models

Integrin αvβ6 and integrin αvβ1 are pivotal mediators in the pathological signaling cascades of pulmonary fibrosis, primarily via their role in activating latent transforming growth factor‐β (TGF-β), which drives fibroblast activation and subsequent myofibroblast differentiation with robust extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and contraction. In fibrotic lung tissue, αvβ6 is predominantly found on alveolar epithelial cells, whereas αvβ1 is overexpressed on fibroblasts; together, these integrins contribute to the local amplification of TGF-β signaling through direct binding to the RGD sequence of the latency-associated peptide (LAP) bound to latent TGF-β isoforms (decaris2021dualinhibitionof pages 1-2).

Functional validation studies using precision-cut lung slices (PCLSs) from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and bleomycin-induced murine models have demonstrated that selective inhibition of these integrins—especially via dual inhibitors such as PLN-74809—results in significant downregulation of pro-fibrotic gene expression, including a reduction in COL1A1 mRNA levels. Notably, dual inhibition consistently achieved a more pronounced decrease in fibroblast activation markers and collagen deposition in ex vivo 3D culture systems than selective inhibition of either integrin alone, highlighting their additive roles in activating mechanotransduction pathways (decaris2021dualinhibitionof pages 4-5).

Mechanotransduction receptors, which include the integrin family itself along with downstream effectors such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Rho/ROCK, detect and translate mechanical cues from the stiffened extracellular matrix into biochemical signals. These signals further enhance fibroblast contractility and ECM deposition. Validation of integrin-mediated mechanotransduction in 3D contraction assays has provided clear evidence that antagonism of αvβ6 and αvβ1 not only interrupts TGF-β activation but also suppresses fibroblast-driven matrix contraction—a crucial step in fibrosis progression (sharip2025mechanosignalingviaintegrins pages 32-33).

Preclinical models have also established the pharmacokinetic properties and safety of these dual inhibitors. Oral dosing of compounds like PLN-74809 in bleomycin-induced mouse models leads to sustained plasma and lung tissue exposure, with dose-dependent reductions in Smad phosphorylation and interstitial collagen deposition. These outcomes correlate directly with effective disruption of integrin-mediated TGF-β signaling and subsequent amelioration of fibrotic pathology. Importantly, the dual inhibitor achieved antifibrotic concentrations in the low nanomolar range, outperforming standard-of-care therapies such as nintedanib and pirfenidone—which required higher micromolar doses and failed to induce similar suppression of collagen gene expression in 3D models (decaris2021dualinhibitionof pages 9-11).

Furthermore, 3D contraction assays have been instrumental in functionally validating the efficacy of integrin antagonists. These assays, which closely recapitulate the fibrotic microenvironment, have demonstrated that dual αvβ6/αvβ1 inhibition significantly reduces fibroblast-mediated matrix contraction, thereby mitigating the mechanical stress that perpetuates TGF-β signaling. This evidence supports a therapeutic strategy that directly targets the integrin axis without inducing systemic TGF-β suppression, which is critical for minimizing off-target toxicities (decaris2021dualinhibitionof pages 6-8).

In summary, integrin αvβ6 and αvβ1, along with associated mechanotransduction receptors, are central to fibroblast activation and matrix remodeling in pulmonary fibrosis. Functional studies, including 3D contraction assays and preclinical IPF models, establish that dual inhibition of these integrins effectively attenuates TGF-β-driven fibrogenesis, with favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles that underscore their promise as therapeutic targets (decaris2021dualinhibitionof pages 11-12, sharip2025mechanosignalingviaintegrins pages 32-33).
