Query: Identification and validation of novel molecular targets driving fibroblast-mediated matrix contraction in IPF: genome-wide CRISPR or siRNA screens, candidate target prioritization, and small-molecule inhibitors with demonstrated binding affinity, pathway modulation, and functional contraction assay inhibition

The available data indicate that while no registered clinical trials have yet investigated genome‐wide CRISPR or siRNA screens specifically targeting fibroblast‐mediated matrix contraction in IPF (Clinical Trials Search: fibroblast matrix contraction AND idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis AND (CRISPR OR siRNA OR small‐molecule inhibitor)), several preclinical studies have addressed target identification, candidate prioritization, and small‐molecule inhibitor development in related fibrotic pathways.

First, genome‐wide screening approaches have been employed to uncover genes and signaling networks critical to fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. For example, an siRNA screen focusing on regulators of αSMA+ stress fibers in human lung fibroblasts identified epigenetic factors such as CBX5 and G9a, underscoring their role in maintaining fibroblasts in an activated state (Ligresti2019cbx5g9ah3k9memediatedgenerepression pages 1-2). Complementarily, a genome‐wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen in a TGF‐β1-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) model identified a set of genes—including COL20A1, COL27A1, and WNT11—that significantly influence ECM protein deposition and cellular contractility (tan2025genomewidecrisprcas9screening pages 6-8, tan2025genomewidecrisprcas9screening pages 13-13). These studies illustrate the utility of unbiased screening approaches in prioritizing novel targets that modulate profibrotic signaling and matrix contraction in IPF.

Next, candidate target prioritization from these screens has highlighted both well‐known and novel regulators. Epigenetic modulators like CBX5 and the histone methyltransferase G9a appear essential in repressing antifibrotic gene transcription and thereby promoting fibroblast activation (Ligresti2019cbx5g9ah3k9memediatedgenerepression pages 1-2). Furthermore, several other pathways—such as TGF‐β, Rho kinase (ROCK), and integrin‐mediated signaling—are implicated. For instance, inhibition of the ROCK pathway with selective ROCK2 inhibitors like KD025 has demonstrated reductions in collagen secretion and fibrosis progression in animal models (fragni2022identificationofnovel pages 47-50). Similarly, integrin inhibitors targeting αvβ6 (e.g., GSK3008348, PLN-74809) have been explored as potential modulators of fibroblast activation and contraction (korfei2022targetinghistonedeacetylases pages 5-6).

Finally, on the small-molecule inhibitor front, various compounds have been evaluated for their binding affinity to target proteins, capacity to modulate key profibrotic pathways, and inhibition in functional assays of fibroblast-mediated contraction. Notably, several small molecules have been developed targeting the autotaxin (ATX)-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) axis. For example, GLPG1690, an oral ATX inhibitor, demonstrated reduction of collagen content and effective pathway modulation in preclinical fibrotic models (fragni2022identificationofnovel pages 44-47). In parallel, other compounds such as the inhaled galectin-3 inhibitor TD139 and the second-generation JNK inhibitor CC-90001 have shown promising antifibrotic activity, impacting markers of fibroblast activation and ECM deposition (fragni2022identificationofnovel pages 44-47). Moreover, recent work with novel cinnamic acid amides—designated as N23Ps—has revealed highly potent inhibition of TGF-β1-induced ECM deposition and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation in primary human lung fibroblasts, with functional contraction assays demonstrating dramatic modulation of cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization (gerckens2023discoveryofnew pages 72-82, gerckens2023discoveryofnew pages 94-98).

In summary, although direct clinical trial evidence utilizing genome-wide CRISPR or siRNA screens for fibroblast-mediated matrix contraction in IPF is currently lacking, preclinical studies have robustly identified and prioritized molecular targets using these high-throughput screening methods. Subsequent development of small-molecule inhibitors—such as ATX inhibitors, ROCK2 inhibitors, and novel cinnamic acid amides—has provided compelling evidence through biochemical binding, pathway modulation, and functional contraction assays. These insights offer promising avenues for future therapeutic strategies targeting the fibrotic mechanisms in IPF (tan2025genomewidecrisprcas9screening pages 6-8, Ligresti2019cbx5g9ah3k9memediatedgenerepression pages 1-2, gerckens2023discoveryofnew pages 72-82).
