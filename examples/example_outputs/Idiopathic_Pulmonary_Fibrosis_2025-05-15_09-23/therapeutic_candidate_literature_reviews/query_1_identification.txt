Query: Identification of novel small-molecule anti-fibrotic compounds by high-throughput screening in 3D collagen gel contraction assays: studies reporting target validation, structure–activity relationship, efficacy in IPF patient-derived fibroblasts, mechanism confirmation, ADME/pharmacokinetic and safety profiles

Multiple studies have demonstrated a comprehensive, multi-tiered approach for identifying novel small-molecule anti‐fibrotic compounds. Although explicit high‐throughput screening (HTS) via 3D collagen gel contraction assays is not reported in complete detail in the present context, the data indicate that related advanced 3D models are extensively used for target validation, mechanism confirmation, and preliminary structure–activity relationship (SAR) optimization.

For instance, GLPG4617 (formerly OATD‐01), a potent and selective chitinase inhibitor, was extensively evaluated in preclinical bleomycin‐induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse models where its efficacy was comparable to that of Nintedanib, a standard anti‐fibrotic agent. In these studies, the compound’s target engagement was demonstrated by effective chitinase activity suppression, and early phase clinical evaluations confirmed a favorable tolerability profile and proper mechanistic activity (fragni2022identificationofnovel pages 50-53). This illustrates that detailed ADME/PK profiles were integrated early on in the discovery process, lending confidence to its translational potential.

Regarding in vitro methods, advanced culture systems such as 3D collagen gel contraction assays and related platforms like the Scar-in-a-Jar assay have been employed. These platforms allow functional assessment of fibroblast contractility, collagen deposition, α‐SMA expression, and cytotoxicity. Although the context does not provide an explicit HTS protocol using 3D collagen gel contraction assays, it highlights that such assays offer a more physiologically relevant environment compared to conventional 2D cultures. This is particularly critical when evaluating compounds in patient-derived IPF fibroblasts where cell–matrix interactions dictate the fibrotic phenotype (fragni2022identificationofnovel pages 53-56, vazquezarmendariz20223dinvitro pages 4-5).

The process of structure–activity relationship (SAR) analysis is implicitly embedded in these studies through iterative chemical modifications informed by multi-parametric assay data. For example, compounds targeting the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling pathway, such as GLPG1690 and various LPA receptor antagonists, have undergone chemical optimization to improve target specificity and minimize off-target effects, as seen with the evolution of BMS986020 to BMS‐986278 (fragni2022identificationofnovel pages 44-47). Although detailed SAR data specific to a HTS using 3D collagen gel contraction assays are not explicitly included, the overall approach underlines the importance of fine-tuning the chemical properties of lead compounds in parallel with efficacy assessments in advanced in vitro systems.

Efficacy assessments using patient-derived fibroblasts are critical. Primary lung fibroblasts cultured in 3D collagen gels or within more complex models (e.g., lung organoids and precision-cut lung slices) have been leveraged to recapitulate in vivo-like conditions. These systems validate the anti-fibrotic mechanism of candidate drugs by confirming reductions in pro-fibrotic markers and matrix remodeling—key readouts that bridge the gap between artificial in vitro assays and the human disease state (vazquezarmendariz20223dinvitro pages 8-8, fragni2022identificationofnovel pages 53-56).

Finally, comprehensive ADME/PK and safety evaluations serve as an essential checkpoint in the drug development process. GLPG4617, for example, was shown to have favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics and tolerability in phase Ib clinical studies, reaffirming the importance of aligning preclinical efficacy data with pharmacological profiling to support clinical trials (fragni2022identificationofnovel pages 50-53, fragni2022identificationofnovel pages 59-63).

In summary, while the provided context does not detail a specific HTS campaign solely based on 3D collagen gel contraction assays, it effectively outlines an integrated strategy. This approach combines advanced 3D in vitro assays—which can be adapted for high-throughput settings—with robust target and mechanism validation in patient-derived cells, iterative SAR refinement, and rigorous ADME/PK and safety assessments, all of which are indispensable for the successful translation of novel anti-fibrotic compounds to clinical application (fragni2022identificationofnovel pages 50-53, fragni2022identificationofnovel pages 44-47, fragni2022identificationofnovel pages 53-56, vazquezarmendariz20223dinvitro pages 4-5).
