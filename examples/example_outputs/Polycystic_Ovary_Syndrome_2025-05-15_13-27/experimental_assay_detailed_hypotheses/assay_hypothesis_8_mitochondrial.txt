Assay Overview:
This assay employs the Seahorse XF analyzer to measure the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in granulosa cells, which are pivotal for ovarian follicle development. These measurements allow direct evaluation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolytic activity in real time. As mitochondrial dysfunction is a central aspect of PCOS pathogenesis, the chosen assay models the bioenergetic deficits observed in granulosa cells from PCOS patients. By using primary granulosa cells or even patient‐derived induced pluripotent stem cells as the biological material, the assay can effectively mimic the cellular environment of the ovary in PCOS, providing a platform for assessing therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring mitochondrial function (min2018newinsightsinto pages 1-2, gao2023oxidativestressand pages 4-5).

Biomedical Evidence:
There is compelling evidence linking mitochondrial dysfunction in granulosa cells to the pathogenesis of PCOS. Multiple studies have documented that impaired mitochondrial respiration, decreased ATP production, and increased oxidative stress in these cells contribute directly to poor oocyte quality and disrupted folliculogenesis, hallmarks of PCOS (gao2023oxidativestressand pages 4-5, zhang2019polycysticovarysyndrome pages 1-2). The dynamic measurement of OCR and ECAR captures the real‐time bioenergetic profile of these cells, reflecting critical changes in mitochondrial and glycolytic functions that are central to insulin resistance and metabolic imbalances reported in PCOS patients. This approach is supported by both biomedical and clinical studies that highlight mitochondrial bioenergetics as an emerging therapeutic target in PCOS (wang2020theeffectsof pages 10-11, mansoori2024granulosacellinsight pages 12-14).

Previous Use:
The Seahorse XF technology has been previously utilized in the context of PCOS-related research. For instance, patient-derived iPSCs from PCOS women have been evaluated with extracellular flux assays to demonstrate decreased mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic capacity, with partial rescue observed upon metformin treatment (min2018newinsightsinto pages 1-2, min2018newinsightsinto pages 8-10). Similar methodological approaches have been applied in studies assessing mitochondrial function in granulosa cells and other relevant tissues, indicating that OCR and ECAR are reliable biomarkers for cellular energy metabolism. Additionally, related studies using mitochondrial respiration assays have contributed significant insights into the roles of oxidative stress and mitochondrial biogenesis in PCOS pathogenesis (gao2023oxidativestressand pages 1-2, placidi2023acylcarnitinesexertpositive pages 1-2).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of the assay include its ability to provide a dynamic, quantitative measure of mitochondrial function and glycolytic flux, which are directly impacted in PCOS. The use of the Seahorse XF analyzer offers high sensitivity and reproducibility, allowing subtle therapeutic effects on mitochondrial performance to be detected. This is particularly valuable in early-stage drug discovery where understanding the mechanistic impact of a candidate compound is crucial (min2018newinsightsinto pages 1-2, gao2023oxidativestressand pages 4-5).

However, there are some weaknesses. PCOS is a multifactorial disorder with heterogeneous clinical manifestations, which may not be entirely recapitulated by granulosa cell models alone. Additionally, isolation and maintaining primary granulosa cells in culture can be technically challenging, potentially affecting assay reproducibility. While the assay provides essential information on cellular bioenergetics, it does not capture the full spectrum of hormonal and systemic metabolic interactions inherent in PCOS. Finally, despite promising results in preclinical settings, further validation in clinical contexts is necessary before mitochondrial respiration assays can be widely accepted as definitive markers of therapeutic efficacy (zhang2019polycysticovarysyndrome pages 1-2, NCT02302326).

In summary, the Seahorse XF mitochondrial respiration assay in granulosa cells is a valuable tool for early-stage testing of therapeutics for PCOS. It offers direct, mechanistic insights into mitochondrial dysfunction—a key driver in PCOS pathogenesis—and can help identify promising drug candidates by monitoring improvements in cellular bioenergetics (min2018newinsightsinto pages 1-2, gao2023oxidativestressand pages 1-2).
