N-Acetylcysteine (NAC; Sigma-Aldrich catalog #A7250),"Proposal for N-Acetylcysteine (NAC; Sigma-Aldrich catalog #A7250)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an acetylated derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid L-cysteine. Initially discovered for its mucolytic properties and later recognized for its potent antioxidant capacity, NAC is synthesized by acetylating cysteine, thereby increasing its stability, solubility, and oral bioavailability. As a member of the antioxidant and thiol donor class of drugs, NAC is widely used as an antidote in acetaminophen overdose due to its ability to replenish intracellular glutathione (GSH) and to directly scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). Its chemical structure, which includes a free sulfhydryl group, allows it to interact with electrophilic compounds and serve as a reducing agent. Over the years, the compound has been repurposed for various clinical applications including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver pathologies, and recently, endocrine and metabolic disorders such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) (Salehpour et al., 2009). This compound is commercially available; for example, Sigma-Aldrich catalog #A7250 supplies a standardized, pharmaceutical grade material that has been utilized in numerous preclinical and clinical studies. The class of antioxidant compounds to which NAC belongs has a long history of investigation in mitigating oxidative damage in various tissues, and its ability to serve as a glutathione precursor is central to its application in conditions where oxidative stress and inflammation play pathophysiological roles (Salehpour et al., 2009; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, NAC has been used for its mucolytic effects in respiratory disorders and as an effective antidote for acetaminophen toxicity due to its property of restoring glutathione levels in hepatic tissues. In recent decades, its use has expanded toward conditions characterized by heightened oxidative stress and inflammation. Clinical investigations have begun to explore its role in metabolic diseases, particularly in PCOS—a multifactorial endocrine disorder characterized by insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, and chronic low-grade inflammation. Several clinical trials have been registered to evaluate NAC in PCOS settings. For instance, the clinical study registered under NCT01008046 conducted by Mansoura University investigated NAC combined with clomiphene citrate (CC) in clomiphene-resistant PCOS patients, reporting improvements in ovulation rate and pregnancy outcomes (Mansoura University, 2007). Similarly, NCT02239107, conducted by Assiut University, evaluated NAC as an adjuvant therapy following laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) in clomiphene-resistant PCOS women, with favorable outcomes in terms of follicular development and ovulation (Badran, 2012). More recently, a trial registered as NCT06836128 compared combined NAC and metformin therapy versus metformin alone, showing promising effects on endocrine-metabolic markers and ovulatory function (Talat, 2025). In addition to these clinical studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have also summarized that NAC supplementation leads to improvements in insulin sensitivity, follicular development, and hormonal profiles in PCOS patients (Asl et al., 2023; Song et al., 2020). Moreover, comparative studies between NAC and the standard insulin-sensitizing agent metformin have indicated that NAC can exert comparable or even superior benefits in certain metabolic parameters while displaying an excellent safety profile and minimal adverse effects, thereby positioning NAC as a promising alternative or adjunctive therapy in PCOS management (Chandil et al., 2019; Salehpour et al., 2009). Overall, the therapeutic history of NAC demonstrates growing evidence of its repurposing for treating PCOS and related metabolic disturbances, supported by preclinical findings, small-scale clinical trials, and meta-analytical reviews that collectively encourage further investigation (Mansoura University, 2007; Badran, 2012; Talat, 2025; Salehpour et al., 2009; Chandil et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
The principal mechanism of action of NAC involves its capacity to restore intracellular antioxidant defense by serving as a precursor for glutathione synthesis. Glutathione, a critical tripeptide, is essential for neutralizing reactive oxygen species and maintaining redox balance within cells. In the context of PCOS, oxidative stress has been implicated as a major contributor to insulin resistance, particularly in ovarian granulosa cells. This oxidative stress can lead to the activation of stress-activated protein kinases such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and IκB kinase (IKK). Activation of these kinases results in the serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), which impairs its ability to mediate downstream insulin signaling via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway (Askari, 2019). In a normal insulin signaling cascade, IRS-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues which facilitates the binding and activation of PI3K, thereby promoting Akt phosphorylation and downstream signaling events. One key downstream effect is the translocation of the glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane, a crucial step for glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues such as skeletal muscle and, importantly, ovarian granulosa cells. Impairments in this pathway contribute to insulin resistance—a hallmark of PCOS. NAC, by reducing ROS levels, directly scavenges free radicals and reinstates a reduced intracellular environment conducive to proper IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation rather than the inhibitory serine phosphorylation induced by JNK and IKK activation (Cheraghi et al., 2017; Salehpour et al., 2009). Restoration of the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt signaling cascade improves GLUT4 translocation and enhances cellular glucose uptake (Fang et al., 2024; Rafiee et al., 2022). Although some studies have not directly measured molecular endpoints such as JNK or IKK phosphorylation in granulosa cells in clinical settings, the overall biochemical evidence supports that NAC exerts its beneficial metabolic effects via these redox-sensitive pathways (Fang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). In summary, NAC’s mechanism is multifaceted: it replenishes glutathione, quenches ROS, downregulates stress kinase activity (JNK, IKK), reduces aberrant IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, and restores insulin receptor signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway—ultimately ensuring effective GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues (Askari, 2019; Cheraghi et al., 2017; Salehpour et al., 2009; Fang et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
Based on the proposed hypothesis, NAC is expected to exert a multifactorial therapeutic effect in PCOS through its antioxidant activity on ovarian granulosa cells. Specifically, by scavenging ROS and replenishing glutathione pools, NAC should lower the ROS-driven activation of JNK and IKK pathways. This reduction in oxidative stress-mediated kinase activity is anticipated to prevent the deleterious serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, thereby restoring proper tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade. With enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling, the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane is expected to improve, thus increasing glucose uptake in granulosa cells. Improved glucose uptake is critical because granulosa cell metabolic competence is directly linked to follicular development and successful ovulation. Several clinical studies in PCOS have correlated NAC supplementation with improved insulin sensitivity, decreased serum testosterone levels, and enhanced ovulatory rates. For instance, clinical trials such as those registered under NCT01008046 and NCT02239107 demonstrated that NAC, when administered in combination with clomiphene citrate, significantly enhanced ovulation and pregnancy rates in clomiphene-resistant PCOS patients (Mansoura University, 2007; Badran, 2012). Additionally, meta-analyses have indicated that NAC treatment results in favorable metabolic and hormonal shifts, including decreased fasting blood glucose, reduced hyperinsulinemia, and lowered total testosterone levels (Asl et al., 2023; Song et al., 2020). In vitro studies suggest that granulosa cells express high levels of the insulin signaling components such as IRS-1, PI3K, and GLUT4, and these are precisely the molecules that the NAC-mediated antioxidant mechanism is aimed to normalize (Fang et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
The accumulated evidence indicates that NAC is a promising therapeutic candidate for PCOS. Among its notable strengths is its excellent safety profile, low cost, and established oral bioavailability. The mechanism of action, which centers on reducing oxidative stress and improving insulin signaling, directly addresses a validated component of PCOS pathophysiology. Clinical trials (e.g., NCT01008046, NCT02239107, NCT06836128) have provided encouraging preliminary data, demonstrating that NAC supplementation can enhance ovulatory function and improve metabolic and hormonal parameters in PCOS patients. These findings are supported by biochemical studies that elucidate how NAC replenishes glutathione and attenuates stress kinase activity, thereby restoring the normal insulin receptor signaling cascade necessary for GLUT4 translocation and cellular glucose uptake (Salehpour et al., 2009; Askari, 2019; Fang et al., 2024).

However, several weaknesses remain. While the preclinical and early clinical data are compelling, many studies have been conducted in relatively small and heterogeneous populations, and longer-term trials are needed to fully establish the efficacy and safety of NAC as a monotherapy or as an adjuvant treatment in PCOS. There is also some variability in the reported outcomes, and the detailed molecular mechanisms in human ovarian tissue, particularly concerning the specific modulation of JNK and IKK pathways, need further elucidation. In addition, although NAC appears to have beneficial effects when combined with other ovulation-inducing agents such as clomiphene citrate, its optimal dosing regimen and long-term impact on metabolic parameters require further research. Despite these limitations, the converging lines of evidence—from in vitro mechanistic studies to in vivo animal models and early-phase clinical trials—strongly support further investigation of NAC for PCOS. The drug candidate’s mechanistic specificity to redox-sensing pathways and its ability to address insulin resistance in granulosa cells offer a scientifically plausible and clinically relevant approach to managing the metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions observed in PCOS (Cheraghi et al., 2017; Song et al., 2020; Talat, 2025).

In conclusion, NAC represents a well-validated candidate for repurposing in the treatment of PCOS. The compound’s ability to reduce oxidative stress, improve insulin sensitivity, and restore normal ovarian function aligns well with the therapeutic needs in PCOS management. Its excellent safety profile, low cost, and oral dosing are additional practical advantages that support rapid clinical translation. Given the encouraging clinical trial signals and the robust mechanistic rationale, further large-scale, long-term randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm its efficacy and to optimize treatment protocols. Overall, NAC stands out as a promising agent with the potential to address both the metabolic and reproductive derangements in PCOS, making it a strong candidate for continued development and eventual clinical implementation in this patient population (Mansoura University, 2007; Badran, 2012; Asl et al., 2023; Song et al., 2020; Salehpour et al., 2009).

Sitagliptin (Merck; DPP-4 inhibitor),"Proposal for Sitagliptin (Merck; DPP-4 inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sitagliptin is a synthetic, orally administered small‐molecule inhibitor originally developed by Merck, and it belongs to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor class that has been widely utilized for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to its ability to enhance the activity of incretin hormones (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This compound was discovered through medicinal chemistry optimization efforts aimed at specifically and reversibly inhibiting the DPP-4 enzyme, leading to extended half-life and increased bioavailability of endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (Daneshjou et al., 2020). As a member of the DPP-4 inhibitor class, sitagliptin has a well-characterized pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and has been approved in many countries for glucose management in patients with T2DM (Devin et al., 2020). The synthetic origins of sitagliptin involve structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies that targeted the DPP-4 enzyme’s active site to achieve high selectivity and potency, setting the foundation for its subsequent clinical development (Ferjan et al., 2017). Its chemical structure features a β-amino acid core that is central to binding the catalytic domain of DPP-4, and this molecular framework distinguishes it from other antihyperglycemic agents (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Clinically, sitagliptin has been used extensively in the treatment of T2DM where its ability to increase circulating GLP-1 levels leads to an improvement in post-prandial insulin secretion and glycemic control (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Several clinical studies and trials, including those registered as NCT03122041 and NCT05972928, have evaluated sitagliptin in subsets of patients with metabolic dysregulation, including populations with risk factors akin to those seen in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023). Preclinical investigations and early clinical data in PCOS populations have pointed to the potential for sitagliptin to improve ovarian function and insulin sensitivity; for example, rodent models of PCOS have shown that DPP-4 inhibition by sitagliptin improves glucose uptake and ovarian histology, suggesting a beneficial role in correcting metabolic and reproductive abnormalities (Daneshjou et al., 2020). In addition to its established use in T2DM, sitagliptin has been evaluated for off-label applications in conditions characterized by insulin resistance, including PCOS, where its role in indirectly modulating ovarian insulin sensitivity is of significant interest (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020). Although the majority of the therapeutic history for sitagliptin involves metabolic disease, emerging data support its repurposing for PCOS, wherein insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism are central features (Daneshjou et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, sitagliptin exerts its biological effect by selectively inhibiting DPP-4, an enzyme responsible for the rapid cleavage and inactivation of incretin hormones such as GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) (Devin et al., 2020). By preventing GLP-1 degradation, sitagliptin prolongs the hormone’s circulating half-life, thereby enhancing its insulinotropic effects in a glucose-dependent manner (Ferjan et al., 2017). The elevated endogenous GLP-1 then binds to its receptor (GLP-1R) on pancreatic beta cells, triggering a cascade that involves the generation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and subsequent activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (Sun et al., 2020). This activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway not only facilitates insulin secretion but also promotes cross-talk with the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, which is critically involved in cell survival, energy metabolism, and insulin sensitization (Liu et al., 2024). In ovarian granulosa cells, these pathways are particularly important because the PI3K/Akt cascade has been implicated in promoting cellular proliferation, steroidogenesis, and overall follicular development (Sun et al., 2020). Additionally, enhanced GLP-1 signaling through increased cAMP levels has been associated with reduced activity of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) pathway, thereby attenuating pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and chronic low-grade inflammation, which are known contributors to PCOS pathophysiology (Devin et al., 2020). Collectively, these molecular interactions offer a plausible explanation for how sitagliptin might improve insulin sensitivity in ovarian tissue, reduce inflammation, and thereby ameliorate multiple metabolic and reproductive derangements observed in PCOS (Khan et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis underpinning the repurposing of sitagliptin for PCOS is that by elevating endogenous GLP-1 levels, the compound will enhance insulin sensitivity in ovarian granulosa cells via a cAMP/PKA-dependent amplification of PI3K/Akt signaling and reduce NFκB-mediated inflammatory activity (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In ovarian granulosa cells, improved insulin sensitivity is expected to promote better glucose uptake and improved steroidogenesis, ultimately leading to normalized follicular development and ovulation; these cells express both the GLP-1 receptor and components of the downstream signaling cascades, such as PKA and Akt, which have been documented in preclinical studies (Daneshjou et al., 2020). Moreover, the capacity of sitagliptin to reduce visceral adipose tissue, as demonstrated in clinical investigations, may assist in lowering systemic insulin resistance, an important driver of hyperandrogenism in PCOS (Devin et al., 2020). By reducing the inflammatory environment through inhibition of NFκB, sitagliptin could further mitigate the ovarian tissue inflammation that contributes to impaired granulosa cell function and folliculogenesis, thereby potentially restoring normal endocrine and reproductive function (Liu et al., 2024). The expected outcome in a clinical assay would be an improvement in ovarian insulin sensitivity marked by enhanced early insulin secretion, lowered post-prandial blood glucose, and favorable shifts in ovarian hormone profiles, as well as improved histological features such as reduced cyst formation and normalized granulosa cell apoptosis (Yadegari, 2021). Additionally, reductions in visceral adiposity and improved metabolic markers indirectly support an improved ovarian microenvironment that favors better follicular maturation (Devin et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, sitagliptin represents a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of PCOS due to its well-established safety profile, extensive clinical use in T2DM, and the compelling molecular rationale that supports its repurposing for metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions associated with PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). The strengths of sitagliptin include its ability to enhance endogenous GLP-1 levels, thereby indirectly activating cAMP/PKA-dependent and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways that are critical for both pancreatic beta cell and ovarian granulosa cell function (Devin et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). This mechanism not only improves insulin secretion and sensitivity but also has the added potential to reduce chronic inflammation via NFκB suppression, which may further contribute to the restoration of normal ovarian function (Liu et al., 2024). Furthermore, clinical data from studies in related metabolic disorders have demonstrated sitagliptin’s efficacy in reducing hyperglycemia, visceral fat, and some inflammatory markers, supporting its potential utility in PCOS where insulin resistance and visceral adiposity are major pathological features (Daneshjou et al., 2021; Devin et al., 2020).

Nevertheless, several weaknesses and unanswered questions must be considered. Although preclinical models and early-phase clinical investigations offer promising signals, direct evidence of sitagliptin’s impact on ovarian granulosa cell signaling—specifically through cAMP/PKA–PI3K/Akt and NFκB pathways—in human PCOS patients remains limited (Daneshjou et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). Additionally, while the drug’s metabolic benefits in reducing visceral adiposity and improving beta cell function are clear in diabetic populations, translating these benefits to the reproductive aspects of PCOS, such as folliculogenesis and ovulation, requires further rigorous clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Daneshjou et al., 2021). There is also the challenge of distinguishing the direct effects on ovarian tissue from systemic improvements in insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, as improvements in these metabolic parameters may not directly translate to enhanced reproductive outcomes (Devin et al., 2020).

Moreover, although the theoretical framework based on GLP-1 signaling is robust, the degree to which sitagliptin can modulate the intracellular signaling cascade within the ovarian microenvironment—particularly through PKA–mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and suppression of NFκB—is not fully elucidated in clinical settings (Khan et al., 2022; Devin et al., 2020). Another consideration is the relative magnitude of the anti-inflammatory effects; while some studies in diabetic populations show a reduction in inflammatory cytokines with DPP-4 inhibitors, similar outcomes have not been consistently observed in PCOS trials, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory efficacy may be context-dependent (Devin et al., 2020). Additionally, complex pathophysiological factors in PCOS, including hyperandrogenism, chronic low-grade inflammation, and ovarian stromal fibrosis, may require combination therapy strategies or adjunct treatments alongside sitagliptin to achieve meaningful clinical improvements (Wang et al., 2019).

On the strength side, sitagliptin’s mechanism of action via DPP-4 inhibition is well understood and has been demonstrated to have favorable safety and tolerability in numerous studies over extended periods in T2DM populations, providing a strong clinical foundation for its repurposing (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Ferjan et al., 2017). The drug’s oral administration route and once-daily dosing regimen also present practical advantages in terms of patient compliance compared to injectable therapies such as GLP-1 receptor agonists (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Furthermore, the potential dual benefits of improved metabolic control and possible positive effects on ovarian function position sitagliptin as a multifaceted therapeutic agent that could address both the endocrine and metabolic components of PCOS (Daneshjou et al., 2021; Devin et al., 2020).

In summary, the repurposing of sitagliptin for PCOS is supported by a strong biochemical rationale, which is centered on the enhancement of endogenous GLP-1 levels leading to improved insulin sensitivity and anti-inflammatory effects through cAMP/PKA and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. This mechanism is expected to translate into improved ovarian granulosa cell function and normalized follicular development, thereby potentially alleviating both the metabolic and reproductive abnormalities associated with PCOS (Liu et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2020). However, while the preclinical evidence and indirect clinical data from metabolic studies are promising, further dedicated clinical trials in PCOS populations are necessary to validate these effects and to delineate the specific pathways involved in ovarian tissues (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; Mukherjee et al., 2023). The overall strengths of sitagliptin, including its established safety profile, oral dosing convenience, and mechanistic plausibility via incretin enhancement, make it a promising candidate for drug repurposing in PCOS; yet, challenges remain in establishing direct efficacy in improving reproductive outcomes independently from metabolic improvements (Etrusco et al., 2024).

Given the potential for sitagliptin to correct metabolic disturbances that are intimately linked to the pathogenesis of PCOS, and the supportive preclinical data demonstrating improved ovarian histology and decreased apoptosis in animal models, it is recommended that a comprehensive clinical evaluation be pursued. This evaluation should include mechanistic studies focusing on the cAMP/PKA-dependent activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in ovarian granulosa cells and assessment of NFκB-mediated inflammatory responses to ensure that the hypothesized benefits can be realized in the human PCOS population (Devin et al., 2020; Yadegari, 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Sitagliptin demonstrates considerable promise as a repurposed drug candidate for PCOS treatment. Its long history of safe use in type 2 diabetes, coupled with its clear mechanism of action that involves elevation of GLP-1 levels, points to a potential therapeutic benefit in improving insulin sensitivity, reducing visceral adiposity, and possibly restoring normal ovarian function in PCOS patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). The strengths of this candidate include its well-defined pharmacological profile, the convergence of metabolic and reproductive benefits through incretin enhancement, and the convenience of oral administration that favors patient adherence (Devin et al., 2020; Ferjan et al., 2017).

However, potential weaknesses arise from the need for more direct evidence linking sitagliptin’s biochemical actions specifically to improved ovarian granulosa cell function and reduced NFκB-mediated inflammation in a clinical PCOS context (Daneshjou et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). Additionally, while metabolic improvements in glucose handling and visceral adiposity have been consistently observed, the translational impact on fertility and ovulatory function in PCOS remains to be definitively established (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Daneshjou et al., 2021). In light of these considerations, further mechanistic and clinical studies are warranted to fully validate sitagliptin’s efficacy in PCOS and to clarify the intracellular signaling dynamics in ovarian tissues (Liu et al., 2024; Mukherjee et al., 2023).

In conclusion, sitagliptin has a robust scientific foundation supporting its potential repurposing for PCOS. Its mechanism via DPP-4 inhibition and consequent elevation of endogenous GLP-1 suggests a beneficial role in enhancing insulin sensitivity through cAMP/PKA-dependent amplification of PI3K/Akt signaling and possible attenuation of NFκB-driven inflammation, which are critical processes implicated in the pathogenesis of PCOS (Khan et al., 2022; Devin et al., 2020). The candidate’s favorable safety profile, extensive clinical history in diabetes, and emerging preclinical data in PCOS models make it an attractive drug candidate worthy of further investigation in controlled clinical trials that specifically target the ovarian and reproductive endpoints of PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Etrusco et al., 2024).

Empagliflozin (Boehringer Ingelheim; SGLT2 inhibitor),"Proposal for Empagliflozin (Boehringer Ingelheim; SGLT2 inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Empagliflozin is a small molecule belonging to the sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor class, originally discovered and developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This compound was synthesized based on the principle of inhibiting the SGLT2 protein found in the proximal renal tubule, thereby reducing glucose reabsorption and promoting glycosuria. The development of SGLT2 inhibitors followed the observation that reducing renal glucose uptake could lower plasma glucose levels independent of insulin secretion. Empagliflozin, manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim, benefits from extensive clinical data regarding its pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). As a member of a class of antidiabetic agents that have been well characterized in diabetic and metabolic syndrome populations, empagliflozin has shown beneficial effects in terms of weight reduction, improvements in insulin sensitivity, and cardiovascular protection. Its high specificity for the SGLT2 isoform minimizes off‐target effects and contributes to a favorable safety profile in women. This background provides a suitable foundation to evaluate its repurposing for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) given the overlap in metabolic dysregulation, particularly hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, between T2DM and PCOS (Zhang et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Empagliflozin has a long history of clinical use in the treatment of T2DM and has been extensively studied in large-scale clinical trials, where it has been shown to improve glycemic control, reduce body weight, and decrease cardiovascular risk factors. Its use in patients with metabolic syndrome has also been well documented, and it has demonstrated consistent benefits in reducing hyperglycemia via glycosuria. In recent years, several clinical trials have begun to explore the repurposing of empagliflozin for conditions beyond T2DM. Notably, trials such as NCT03008551 and NCT05200793 have evaluated the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin, in women with PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). These studies focus on biochemical parameters such as fasting insulin levels, HOMA‐IR scores, and hormonal profiles, indicating that the drug not only induces weight loss but may also exert beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and circulating androgen levels in PCOS patients (Mahmoud et al., 2023, pp. 1–2; Marinkovic-Radosevic et al., 2021, pp. 2–4). Furthermore, meta-analytic data and preliminary clinical trial evidence have provided early indications that SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce hyperinsulinemia, a central feature of PCOS pathology (Mrabet et al., 2024, pp. 1–2).

Mechanism of Action:
The molecular mechanism of empagliflozin is well understood and centers on its inhibition of the SGLT2 protein in the kidney’s proximal tubules. SGLT2 is responsible for approximately 90% of renal glucose reabsorption; by inhibiting this transporter, empagliflozin induces glycosuria, which reduces blood glucose levels in an insulin-independent manner. The resultant decrease in plasma glucose concentration leads to a lower insulin demand from pancreatic β‐cells, consequently reducing systemic hyperinsulinemia. This is particularly relevant for PCOS, where hyperinsulinemia is known to exacerbate ovarian androgen production. In hyperinsulinemic states, excess insulin acts synergistically with luteinizing hormone (LH) to stimulate theca cell androgen production, while also reducing hepatic synthesis of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), thereby increasing free circulating testosterone. By mitigating hyperinsulinemia, empagliflozin indirectly diminishes these androgenogenic processes and may help restore insulin sensitivity in ovarian tissues, including granulosa cells.

At the molecular level, studies have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors such as empagliflozin improve insulin sensitivity not only systemically but also via modulation of intracellular signaling pathways. For instance, glucose removal via glycosuria is associated with reductions in glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity, conditions known to impair insulin receptor signaling. In animal models of PCOS, interventions with empagliflozin—alone or in combination with metformin—have been linked to upregulation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in ovarian tissue. Activation of the AMPK/SIRT1 axis is critical for improving mitochondrial function, reducing inflammatory cytokine production, and ultimately enhancing insulin signaling in target tissues such as ovarian granulosa cells (Mahmoud et al., 2023, pp. 12–13; Rakic et al., 2023, pp. 10–12). These molecular interactions are promising because insulin receptor desensitization in granulosa cells is implicated in abnormal ovarian glucose uptake and impaired follicular development in PCOS. In addition, empagliflozin’s metabolic actions include modest effects on body fat distribution, which may further improve the metabolic milieu pertinent to ovarian function (Marinkovic-Radosevic et al., 2021, pp. 6–8; Rakic et al., 2023, pp. 7–8). The drug’s pharmacokinetic profile, characterized by good oral bioavailability, predictable half-life, and renal clearance, supports its application in chronic diseases such as PCOS where long-term metabolic modulation is desired (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis that empagliflozin-induced glycosuria will reduce systemic hyperinsulinemia, the expected effect in PCOS patients is a reduction in insulin-driven ovarian androgen production. In PCOS, hyperinsulinemia not only increases androgen secretion by the ovaries but also contributes to ovarian insulin resistance by desensitizing insulin receptors on granulosa cells. The reduction in circulating insulin levels is anticipated to restore more normal insulin receptor function in these cells, enhancing their ability to uptake glucose effectively and potentially normalizing follicular development. Clinical trials have shown that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors leads to improvements in weight, insulin sensitivity measured by HOMA-IR, and reduced circulating insulin levels (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023). Preclinical studies further corroborate these findings, as combination therapy with metformin and empagliflozin in rat models of PCOS has demonstrated improvements in ovarian morphology—such as fewer cystic follicles and increased granulosa cell layer thickness—with concurrent reductions in circulating testosterone and inflammatory markers (Mahmoud et al., 2023, pp. 15–16; Marinkovic-Radosevic et al., 2021, pp. 4–5).

Moreover, by lowering systemic insulin, empagliflozin may indirectly affect the ovarian microenvironment by reducing the insulin–LH synergy that typically drives excessive androgen synthesis. This would result in reduced free androgen levels, due in part to an increase in SHBG production by the liver. Such changes would be beneficial in alleviating the clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism, including hirsutism, acne, and menstrual irregularities. On a cellular level, improvement in insulin signaling within granulosa cells may be reflected in enhanced glucose uptake and restored energy balance within ovarian follicles, thereby promoting normal oocyte maturation and ovulation (Mrabet et al., 2024, pp. 8–9; Rakic et al., 2023, pp. 8–9). Given that the expression of insulin receptors in ovarian granulosa cells is well documented, and considering that insulin signaling pathways are intricately involved in proper follicular development, the expected outcome is a dual benefit encompassing both systemic metabolic improvements and direct ovarian benefits.

Overall Evaluation:
Empagliflozin shows considerable promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for PCOS based on its well-defined pharmacologic actions in T2DM and metabolic syndrome. Its primary strength lies in its ability to reduce plasma glucose independently of insulin secretion and thereby lower systemic hyperinsulinemia. This reduction can have downstream benefits on ovarian androgen production, which is central to the pathophysiology of PCOS. Additionally, the favorable safety, PK/PD profiles, and extensive clinical experience in diabetic populations support its translational application in women with PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). Preclinical studies in PCOS animal models have provided encouraging data—showing that empagliflozin, especially when used in combination with metformin, can improve ovarian histology and reduce inflammatory markers that exacerbate PCOS pathology (Mahmoud et al., 2023, p. 17; Marinkovic-Radosevic et al., 2021, pp. 2–4).

However, several challenges remain. Although the mechanism of action in reducing hyperglycemia via SGLT2 inhibition is well established, direct evidence linking empagliflozin to improved granulosa cell insulin signaling and reduced ovarian androgen synthesis in humans is still limited. Most current studies come from T2DM cohorts or animal models, and while these provide a proof-of-concept, further dedicated clinical trials in PCOS populations are necessary to confirm efficacy and elucidate the detailed molecular effects on ovarian tissue. For instance, trials such as NCT03008551 and NCT06576375 are beginning to address these endpoints (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024).

Another potential weakness is that many of the anticipated benefits are indirect. While a reduction in hyperinsulinemia is expected to lessen ovarian androgen production via decreased insulin–LH synergy, the extent to which this mechanism translates to clinically meaningful improvements in ovulation and menstrual regulation remains to be fully determined. Additionally, while empagliflozin is known to produce consistent weight loss and metabolic improvements, its impact on inflammatory markers within the ovarian microenvironment is less clear, and inflammation remains a central component in PCOS pathogenesis. Some studies report that empagliflozin can reduce systemic inflammation through modulation of the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway, yet robust ovarian-specific data are lacking (Rakic et al., 2023, pp. 12–13; Mrabet et al., 2024, pp. 9–10).

Despite these shortcomings, the overall evaluation is cautiously optimistic. The indirect modulation of ovarian insulin resistance via systemic metabolic improvements represents an innovative strategy to tackle PCOS, a condition for which current therapeutic options are limited and often come with undesirable side effects. Empagliflozin’s well-established safety profile in women, along with its potential for dual benefits in both glycemic control and androgen regulation, underscores its attractiveness as a candidate for further investigation. The existing literature supports the rationale that lowering hyperinsulinemia through SGLT2 inhibition can effectively mitigate one of the key drivers of PCOS pathology, offering a novel approach that complements existing treatments such as metformin (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023; Marinkovic-Radosevic et al., 2021, pp. 1–2; Rakic et al., 2023, pp. 13–14).

In summary, empagliflozin presents a compelling candidate for repurposing in PCOS therapy. Its strengths include a robust mechanistic rationale based on glycosuria-induced reductions in systemic hyperinsulinemia, potential benefits on ovarian androgen synthesis, a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile in women, and supportive preclinical as well as early clinical trial data. The key weaknesses to be addressed in future research are the need for direct evidence of improved granulosa cell insulin signaling, more comprehensive assessments of ovarian hormonal changes, and the clarification of the molecular pathways within ovarian tissue that are influenced by this therapy. Overall, continued investment in clinical trials and mechanistic studies is warranted to validate empagliflozin as a therapeutic option for PCOS and to delineate the optimal treatment paradigms—alone or in combination with existing agents such as metformin—that may lead to improved reproductive and metabolic outcomes in this patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023; Mahmoud et al., 2023, pp. 1–2; Marinkovic-Radosevic et al., 2021, pp. 2–4; Rakic et al., 2023, pp. 7–8).

INT131 (Ligand Pharmaceuticals; PPARγ partial agonist),"Proposal for INT131 (Ligand Pharmaceuticals; PPARγ partial agonist)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
INT131 is a synthetic, non‐thiazolidinedione (non‐TZD) selective modulator of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) discovered by Ligand Pharmaceuticals. It was identified and optimized by structure–activity relationship studies that sought to retain the insulin sensitizing efficacy characteristic of full PPARγ agonists (such as the TZDs rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) but with a reduced profile of adverse effects. INT131 is classified as a partial agonist of PPARγ, meaning that it induces a unique receptor conformation which leads to a differential recruitment of transcriptional coregulators and, consequently, a “selective” activation of downstream PPARγ target genes. This selective modulatory activity contrasts with the extensive and less discriminating activation achieved by classical TZDs, which often results in unwanted side effects such as fluid retention, weight gain, and bone loss. The discovery and synthesis of INT131 relied on identifying a ligand with high binding affinity—approximately 20‐fold greater than that of rosiglitazone—yet with only partial agonistic activity, translating into potent insulin-sensitizing effects with minimized adipogenic responses (Taygerly et al., 2013; Motani et al., 2009). This therapeutic candidate belongs to a class of compounds known as selective PPARγ modulators (SPPARγMs), a subset of nuclear receptor ligands that have been investigated primarily for their benefits in treating metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) while avoiding the full agonist side effects associated with TZDs (Higgins & Mantzoros, 2008).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, full PPARγ agonists such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone have been used in clinical practice to improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control in patients with T2DM; however, their use has been severely limited by significant adverse events, including fluid retention, weight gain, and cardiovascular risks. Over recent years, the drug development focus has shifted to identifying compounds that can dissociate the insulin-sensitizing action of PPARγ activation from these negative side effects. INT131 emerged from these efforts and has demonstrated promising antidiabetic efficacy in several preclinical models. In particular, INT131 has been evaluated in rodent diabetic models such as the Zucker fa/fa and diet-induced obese mice, where it robustly lowered plasma glucose and improved insulin sensitivity with fewer signs of fluid retention and weight gain compared with full agonists (Motani et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2012). Clinical trials in humans, notably a Phase 2 study in patients with T2DM (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2003), have confirmed that INT131 can achieve significant glucose lowering with a favorable side effect profile characterized by minimal fluid retention and weight gain (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2003; DePaoli et al., 2014). Although the candidate has not been directly evaluated in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) patients, the mechanistic overlap between the insulin resistance seen in T2DM and that observed in PCOS provides a strong rationale for considering its repurposing in PCOS. Clinical and biochemical parallels exist between T2DM and PCOS, particularly concerning insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation, thus suggesting that the beneficial properties of INT131 may extend to disorders such as PCOS where insulin sensitivity is impaired (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
The molecular mechanism of INT131 centers on its ability to bind to PPARγ and selectively modulate its transcriptional activity. Unlike full agonists that robustly activate all downstream genes by stabilizing the receptor’s activation function-2 (AF2) helix through direct hydrogen bonding with the Y473 residue, INT131 exhibits a unique binding mode that relies on water-mediated hydrogen bonding through its sulfonamide group and, consequently, does not interact directly with Y473. This leads to partial receptor activation and differential recruitment of coactivators and corepressors, thus engendering a gene expression profile that preferentially enhances insulin sensitization without fully triggering adipogenic pathways (Motani et al., 2009; Higgins & Mantzoros, 2008). At the cellular level, modulation of PPARγ activity by INT131 is expected to upregulate the expression of insulin-sensitizing adipokines such as adiponectin. Adiponectin is a key hormone secreted by adipocytes that enhances glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation, primarily by upregulating the expression and translocation of the insulin-dependent glucose transporter GLUT4. In addition, selective PPARγ modulation has been associated with a reduction in pathological serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), a post-translational modification that often contributes to impaired insulin signaling in insulin resistant states (Bremer & Miller, 2008; Chen et al., 2017). In tissues relevant to PCOS pathology – particularly ovarian granulosa cells – the improved insulin signaling mediated by these mechanisms could restore normal metabolic functions that are frequently disrupted in the syndrome. Evidence from preclinical studies in diabetic and obese models indicates that INT131 enhances PI3K/Akt signaling, thereby facilitating glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues without the adverse effects that typically accompany full PPARγ activation (Lee et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2017). The selective modulation of PPARγ by INT131, therefore, positions it to exert a dual pharmacodynamic effect: maintaining sufficient insulin sensitization through adiponectin and GLUT4 upregulation while curbing the adverse adipogenic and fluid-retentive pathways that plague TZDs (Chen et al., 2017; Motani et al., 2009).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the expected effect of INT131 on PCOS pathology is multifold. First, it is hypothesized to selectively modulate PPARγ in ovarian granulosa cells – a cell type central to folliculogenesis and steroid hormone synthesis – thereby upregulating genes that promote insulin sensitivity. Granulosa cells in PCOS typically display insulin resistance, partly due to increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 which dampens insulin signal transduction (Bremer & Miller, 2008). By reducing IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, INT131 is anticipated to restore more normal insulin receptor signaling within these cells, leading to improved cellular glucose uptake and metabolic regulation. Second, the drug is expected to increase adiponectin secretion, an adipokine that not only improves systemic insulin sensitivity via enhancement of GLUT4 expression and translocation in peripheral tissues but also exerts beneficial paracrine effects on ovarian function (Psilopatis et al., 2023; Przybycień et al., 2022). Third, enhanced GLUT4 expression in granulosa cells, as a result of PPARγ activation, should facilitate more effective insulin-mediated glucose uptake, which is critical for energy provision during follicular development and supports the normal steroidogenic capacity of the ovary (Zhao et al., 2023). Importantly, the selective activation pattern of INT131 is expected to achieve these improvements in metabolic function without eliciting significant fluid retention or adipogenesis; these adverse effects have been major limitations in the use of full agonists like TZDs in metabolic diseases (Lee et al., 2012; DePaoli et al., 2014). Additionally, favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles observed in clinical studies for T2DM—such as effective lowering of plasma glucose and HbA1c, along with minimal weight gain—support the translational feasibility of INT131 for use in other insulin-resistant conditions, including PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2003; Higgins & Mantzoros, 2008). Given that insulin resistance is a critical feature not only in T2DM but also in the pathophysiology of PCOS, particularly with regard to ovarian granulosa cell dysfunction, INT131’s targeted improvement in insulin signaling is expected to have downstream positive effects on reproductive health, including potential normalization of ovulatory cycles and amelioration of hyperandrogenism (Psilopatis et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, the evaluation of INT131 as a therapeutic candidate for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is compelling, yet it presents several challenges and uncertainties that need to be addressed in further research. One of the major strengths of INT131 is its unique mechanism as a selective PPARγ modulator, which allows it to dissociate beneficial insulin-sensitizing effects from the adverse effects that are common with full PPARγ agonists. In preclinical studies, INT131 has demonstrated potent glucose-lowering capability and improved insulin sensitivity comparable to that of traditional TZDs, but with a markedly improved safety profile characterized by reduced fluid retention, less adipogenesis, and minimal cardiovascular impact (Motani et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2012). Its high binding affinity for PPARγ combined with its partial agonist activity suggests that it can selectively activate transcriptional programs that enhance the expression of adiponectin and GLUT4 while also preventing excessive serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. These molecular actions are critical for overcoming insulin resistance, a central pathological feature in both T2DM and PCOS (Bremer & Miller, 2008; Chen et al., 2017).

From a therapeutic history standpoint, INT131 has already demonstrated clinical promise in T2DM patients through Phase 2 studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2003; DePaoli et al., 2014). This provides a solid foundation for its repurposing in PCOS, a condition that shares significant pathological overlap especially with regard to insulin resistance. However, despite these promising findings, INT131 has not yet been directly tested in PCOS patients or in ovarian granulosa cell models. Given that granulosa cells are key to ovarian function and that PPARγ plays a significant role in regulating insulin signaling and steroidogenesis within these cells, the next step should involve targeted preclinical studies using relevant ovarian cell lines or animal models of PCOS. This would directly evaluate whether INT131 is capable of upregulating adiponectin and GLUT4 expression and decreasing IRS-1 serine phosphorylation in granulosa cells, thereby improving cellular insulin sensitivity (Psilopatis et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023).

Another strength of INT131 is its favorable pharmacokinetic profile, including its tissue-selective distribution. Studies indicate that INT131 preferentially accumulates in adipose tissue rather than in the liver or skeletal muscle, which is associated with improved insulin-sensitizing effects and reduced hepatic side effects typical of TZDs (Xie et al., 2017; Motani et al., 2009). This characteristic is particularly advantageous in the treatment of PCOS, where improving adipose tissue function while minimizing liver-related side effects is crucial. Furthermore, the reduced adverse event profile, especially regarding fluid retention and weight gain, addresses a major limitation of TZDs, thereby potentially enhancing patient adherence and overall therapeutic outcomes in a PCOS population that is often overweight or obese (Lee et al., 2012; DePaoli et al., 2014).

However, there are weaknesses and gaps that warrant consideration. The most significant drawback is the current lack of direct evidence for INT131’s efficacy in PCOS. While the preclinical and clinical results in T2DM are encouraging, PCOS has unique pathophysiological components, including hyperandrogenism and altered ovarian folliculogenesis, which may not be entirely addressed by improvements in insulin sensitivity alone. For comprehensive validation, studies must demonstrate that INT131 not only ameliorates systemic insulin resistance but also modulates ovarian-specific pathways – for example, by normalizing granulosa cell function, reducing local inflammatory cytokine production, and ultimately improving ovulatory rates and reducing androgen levels (Psilopatis et al., 2023; Bremer & Miller, 2008).

Additionally, while the molecular mechanisms have been characterized in standard adipocytes and rodent models, extrapolation to human granulosa cells requires careful investigation. It is critical to conduct detailed in vitro experiments using granulosa cell cultures isolated from PCOS patients to assess the impact of INT131 on key molecular markers such as adiponectin production, GLUT4 expression, and IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. Such studies would help to determine if the insulin-sensitizing effects observed in other tissues are recapitulated in the ovarian environment and whether this translates into improved steroidogenesis and follicular development (Chen et al., 2017; Bremer & Miller, 2008).

Another area of concern is the generalizability of the pharmacokinetic data from diabetic models to obese women with PCOS, as tissue distribution and metabolism can differ significantly across patient populations. Although INT131’s selective tissue targeting is a promising feature (Xie et al., 2017), further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies specifically in a PCOS context would be necessary to confirm its effectiveness and safety in this demographic.

In summary, INT131 stands out as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome due to its selective PPARγ modulation that can potentially address the insulin resistance central to PCOS pathology. Its design as a partial agonist offers considerable advantages over full agonists by maintaining insulin-sensitizing effects while minimizing side effects such as fluid retention and adipogenesis. The extensive preclinical and early clinical data in T2DM support its overall efficacy and favorable safety profile (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2003; DePaoli et al., 2014; Motani et al., 2009). Nevertheless, the transition from T2DM to PCOS requires additional focused studies, especially in ovarian granulosa cells and PCOS-specific models, to validate its efficacy in restoring normal ovarian function, improving adiponectin and GLUT4 expression, and reducing aberrant IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. The strengths of INT131 include its robust insulin-sensitizing effects, high binding affinity, selective tissue distribution, and improved safety profile relative to TZDs, while its weaknesses lie primarily in the current lack of direct evidence in PCOS and the need for further pharmacodynamic studies in relevant cell types. Overall, INT131 merits serious consideration for further preclinical evaluation and eventual clinical trials in PCOS, provided that comprehensive studies confirm its molecular mechanisms and therapeutic outcomes in ovarian tissues as well as in systemic metabolism (Psilopatis et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017).

Below is a detailed evaluation of dihydroberberine (Sigma‐Aldrich catalog #D9879) as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dihydroberberine is a reduced derivative of berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid originally isolated from traditional Chinese medicinal herbs such as Coptis chinensis and Berberis aristata. Unlike its progenitor, berberine, dihydroberberine has been chemically modified to maximize oral absorption and enhance its bioavailability. This chemical reduction transforms the quaternary ammonium structure of berberine into a more lipophilic form, which by in vitro and in vivo studies has demonstrated superior absorption in the gastrointestinal tract as well as an improved pharmacokinetic profile. As a member of the berberine analog class, dihydroberberine belongs to a large family of compounds that share similar molecular features and are known to exert metabolic and insulin‐sensitizing properties. Historically, berberine itself has been studied extensively across diverse therapeutic areas, particularly in metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity, which share common pathophysiologic mechanisms with PCOS. The structural modification that leads to dihydroberberine is intended to overcome one of the major limitations of berberine – its very low oral bioavailability (often reported to be less than 1%)—which necessitates high doses that can lead to undesirable gastrointestinal effects. In this context, dihydroberberine is an attractive candidate because its improved absorption and enhanced potency in activating AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) may allow lower effective doses and possibly a reduced side‐effect profile (An et al., 2014; Li et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, berberine has been applied in various preclinical and clinical settings to treat metabolic disturbances, largely due to its capacity to improve insulin sensitivity and regulate glucose and lipid metabolism. Many investigative studies have demonstrated that berberine reduces insulin resistance and improves glucose homeostasis in animal models of diabetes and even in rodent models of PCOS. For example, preclinical studies in dehydroepiandrosterone‐induced PCOS rats showed that berberine improved glucolipid metabolism and normalized aberrant ovarian histology, with effects attributed to enhanced insulin receptor function and improved signaling through key metabolic pathways (Li et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2019). In human clinical investigations, berberine has been evaluated in PCOS patients for its beneficial effects on hormonal imbalances, menstrual regularity, and metabolic parameters, often in direct comparisons with standard treatments such as metformin (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rondanelli et al., 2021). Although direct clinical usage of dihydroberberine in PCOS has been limited, safety and pharmacokinetic studies—such as those recorded in clinical trials evaluating its bioavailability (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023)—support its safety and potential utility in a human population. Furthermore, in rodent studies, dihydroberberine has consistently outperformed berberine in terms of plasma exposure and pharmacodynamic effects, suggesting that this analogue could be precisely repurposed for metabolic conditions where insulin resistance plays a central role, including PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Li et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
The principal mechanism by which dihydroberberine is expected to operate centers around the activation of AMPK, a cellular energy sensor that is critically implicated in the regulation of glucose uptake, lipid oxidation, and overall cellular metabolism. AMPK activation has been shown to induce the translocation of GLUT4, the insulin‐responsive glucose transporter, to the plasma membrane of cells including skeletal muscle, adipocytes, and — importantly in the context of PCOS — ovarian granulosa cells (Xie et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2020). In granulosa cells, which play an essential role in follicular development and ovarian steroidogenesis, proper insulin signaling is critical; disruptions in this pathway are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of PCOS. Berberine has been demonstrated in multiple studies to elevate insulin‐mediated glucose uptake via enhancement of PI3K/Akt signaling cascades, an effect that is mediated, at least in part, through AMPK activation (Li et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2019). Dihydroberberine is anticipated to mimic these pathways, but due to its superior pharmacokinetic properties, it may achieve a higher potency in activating AMPK relative to berberine. Once AMPK is activated, downstream signalling promotes GLUT4 translocation, leading to enhanced glucose uptake and improved insulin sensitivity; this is expected to alleviate the hyperinsulinemia and consequent hyperandrogenism observed in many PCOS patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yu et al., 2020). Additionally, the PI3K/Akt pathway, integral for cell survival and metabolic regulation in ovarian granulosa cells, is positively modulated by berberine and its analogs, ensuring that insulin‐mediated signaling is restored to normal physiological function (Yu et al., 2021). At the molecular level, AMPK activation by dihydroberberine may also downregulate hepatic gluconeogenesis, thereby reducing circulating glucose and insulin levels—a beneficial effect for patients with PCOS, in whom systemic insulin resistance exacerbates ovarian dysfunction (Xie et al., 2019; Li et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
Given the established preclinical and emerging clinical evidence on berberine analogs, dihydroberberine is expected to demonstrate several beneficial effects when applied to PCOS granulosa cells. The central hypothesis is that dihydroberberine will enhance AMPK activation more robustly than berberine, which in turn will lead to an increased translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. In ovarian granulosa cells, enhanced GLUT4‐mediated glucose uptake is critical for improving insulin sensitivity and metabolic function, which translates into normalized steroidogenesis and improved follicular development (Xie et al., 2019). As insulin resistance is a key pathophysiological trigger in PCOS, transforming the metabolic state of granulosa cells through improved insulin signaling via the PI3K/Akt axis is expected to have downstream effects on both metabolic and reproductive outcomes (Rondanelli et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). With dihydroberberine’s improved pharmacokinetic profile documented in studies using healthy volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023), it is reasonable to expect that at equivalent or lower doses, dihydroberberine may achieve higher systemic exposure, enhanced AMPK activation, and more potent improvements in insulin‐mediated glucose uptake and signaling pathways in the ovary (Li et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2019). Moreover, by restoring the proper functioning of the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade in granulosa cells, dihydroberberine could reduce androgen production through improved regulation of theca cell steroidogenesis, thus directly addressing one of the hallmark features of PCOS – hyperandrogenism (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yu et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of dihydroberberine as a therapeutic candidate for PCOS is very promising, albeit with areas that require further investigation. One of the primary strengths is its superior oral bioavailability relative to berberine. This enhanced pharmacokinetic profile means that lower doses of dihydroberberine could be used to achieve significant pharmacodynamic effects, thereby limiting the gastrointestinal side effects associated with high‐dose berberine therapy (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; Li et al., 2024). Another notable strength lies in the compound’s mechanistic precision; by robustly activating AMPK and consequently enhancing GLUT4 translocation and PI3K/Akt signaling in ovarian granulosa cells, dihydroberberine targets crucial molecular pathways that are disrupted in PCOS (Xie et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2020). These pathways are directly linked to improved insulin‐mediated glucose uptake, reduced hyperinsulinemia, and normalization of androgen synthesis in the ovaries, which could translate into improved ovulatory function and better reproductive outcomes (Rondanelli et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021).

However, there are also challenges that must be addressed. Despite encouraging data from animal models and pharmacokinetic trial endpoints in healthy volunteers, direct clinical evidence of dihydroberberine’s efficacy in PCOS patients is still limited (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Li et al., 2024). Most of the current literature on berberine in PCOS relies on studies with berberine itself, and while evidence from these studies is supportive of the underlying mechanistic hypothesis, direct comparative studies between dihydroberberine and berberine in PCOS populations are sparse (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Li et al., 2024). Also, although preclinical studies imply that dihydroberberine might lead to greater AMPK activation and enhanced insulin sensitivity, the contextual differences between rodent models and human ovarian granulosa cells necessitate further investigation. Detailed cellular assays examining AMPK phosphorylation status, GLUT4 membrane translocation, and downstream PI3K/Akt pathway activation specifically in human granulosa cells from PCOS patients will be critical to validate the hypothesis (Xie et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2021). Moreover, while the improved safety profile noted in rodent studies and early‐phase clinical trials is promising, rigorous safety assessments in a larger PCOS‐specific cohort are needed to rule out any unexpected adverse reactions when used over longer treatment durations (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023; Rondanelli et al., 2021).

In summary, dihydroberberine has significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for PCOS due to its enhanced oral bioavailability and the mechanistic rationale for improved insulin signaling. Its ability to robustly activate AMPK, facilitate GLUT4 translocation, and promote proper PI3K/Akt signaling in ovarian granulosa cells directly addresses key pathophysiological features of PCOS such as insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. The strengths include the translational feasibility suggested by improved pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, the well‐supported mechanistic pathways derived from berberine studies, and its potential to normalize ovarian function and metabolic profiles in PCOS patients. Weaknesses include the current lack of direct clinical evidence in the PCOS population, the need for more targeted mechanistic studies in human granulosa cells, and the necessity for larger‐scale safety and efficacy trials to fully validate its use. Therefore, while dihydroberberine emerges as a promising candidate, further detailed preclinical and clinical investigations are essential to completely establish its therapeutic value for PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023).

This comprehensive literature review supports directing further research toward dihydroberberine for PCOS, with recommended next steps including (i) dedicated in vitro studies using human ovarian granulosa cells to quantify AMPK, GLUT4, and PI3K/Akt changes; (ii) controlled animal studies comparing dihydroberberine directly against berberine in PCOS models; and (iii) phase I/II clinical trials in women with PCOS to determine clinical efficacy and safety, which will ultimately clarify the translational potential of this promising therapeutic candidate (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023).

Overall, dihydroberberine’s combination of improved pharmacokinetics, confirmed mechanistic actions in metabolic and insulin‐signaling pathways, and its potential efficacy in reversing key pathogenic factors in PCOS make it a strong candidate for drug repurposing in this condition, pending further validation through rigorous experimental and clinical studies (An et al., 2014; Li et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2019).

MSDC-0602K (Cirius Therapeutics; PPARγ modulating MPC inhibitor),"Proposal for MSDC-0602K (Cirius Therapeutics; PPARγ modulating MPC inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MSDC-0602K is a synthetic small‐molecule therapeutic candidate developed by Cirius Therapeutics that belongs to the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class but is specifically engineered to spare direct activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Unlike classical TZDs such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, which were initially discovered through animal phenotypic screens and exert their insulin-sensitizing effects predominantly via PPARγ agonism, MSDC-0602K has been designed to target the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) with minimal PPARγ engagement. As a PPARγ-sparing TZD, it modulates mitochondrial pyruvate flux and cellular energy metabolism without inducing the adverse effects (for example, fluid retention, weight gain, and bone loss) that are typically associated with full PPARγ activation (Colca, 2015, pp. 5–6; Huang et al., 2024, pp. 11–12). The molecule is a second-generation TZD analog developed using medicinal chemistry approaches that focus on structural modifications—such as retention of an asymmetric carbon at the 5-position of the TZD ring but with chemical modifications that reduce PPARγ affinity—while preserving the capability to inhibit MPC. In this context, the compound’s discovery arose from investigations into the metabolic actions of first-generation TZDs that indicated a mitochondrial component to their insulin-sensitizing effects; subsequent research identified the MPC—composed of MPC1 and MPC2—as a critical target mediating these benefits (Colca et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Chen et al., 2022, pp. 14–15). As such, MSDC-0602K falls within the subclass of “mTOT” modulators that aim to improve systemic metabolism through direct modulation of mitochondrial substrate handling rather than through conventional nuclear receptor pathways.

Therapeutic History:
Historically, the TZD class has been employed primarily in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) owing to their insulin-sensitizing properties, with pioglitazone and rosiglitazone serving as prototypical agents. However, their clinical utility has been hindered by side effects resulting from PPARγ activation. In response, next-generation TZDs such as MSDC-0602K have been developed to retain the beneficial metabolic effects while minimizing PPARγ-mediated adverse events. Preclinical studies using rodent models, including diet-induced obese and db/db mice, have demonstrated that compounds like MSDC-0602K improve glycemic control, decrease hyperinsulinemia, reduce hepatic lipogenesis, and lower circulating liver enzymes—outcomes that are achieved predominantly via modulation of mitochondrial metabolism rather than through classical PPARγ agonism (Colca, 2015, pp. 6–8; Benova et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). In clinical settings, phase II and phase III trials have been conducted in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and T2DM, evaluating endpoints such as improvements in hepatic histology, reductions in HbA1c, and better glycemic parameters with a favorable safety profile (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022). Although there is substantial clinical data supporting its use in T2DM and NASH, there is not yet any published trial or extensive preclinical data specifically addressing its use in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) or similar reproductive metabolic disorders. Nevertheless, PCOS shares a central pathophysiological element—in particular, insulin resistance—with T2DM, which forms part of the rationale for repurposing MSDC-0602K toward PCOS therapeutic approaches (Yuan et al., 2022, pp. 1–3; Colca et al., 2017, pp. 2–4).

Mechanism of Action:
MSDC-0602K operates primarily through the inhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), which is essential for transporting pyruvate from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix where it serves as a critical substrate for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and subsequent adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Under normal conditions, pyruvate imported via the MPC is metabolized either by conversion to acetyl-CoA via pyruvate dehydrogenase or to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase—routes that are pivotal for gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis in hepatocytes (Colca, 2015, pp. 9–11; McCommis & Finck, 2023, pp. 4–5). By partially blocking MPC-mediated pyruvate uptake, MSDC-0602K induces a metabolic shift that reduces substrate flow into mitochondrial oxidation pathways. This results in a decrease in hepatic gluconeogenesis as less pyruvate is available for conversion into glucose precursors. Additionally, this forced alteration of pyruvate flux is thought to generate a compensatory increase in cytosolic redox states, with subsequent activation of the energy-sensing enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Ferguson et al., 2023, pp. 18–22; Huang et al., 2024, p. 16). AMPK is well known for its role in enhancing insulin signaling via downstream activation of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. In several preclinical models, activation of AMPK by compounds that inhibit MPC has correlated with improved insulin sensitivity and enhanced glucose uptake in peripheral tissues (Kamm et al., 2020, pp. 11–14; Colca et al., 2017, pp. 1–2). Beyond these primary actions, TZD-like molecules such as MSDC-0602K have been associated with modulation of mitochondrial function, including alterations in substrate preferences for oxidation (e.g., a shift from glucose oxidation to enhanced lipid oxidation) and reductions in the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Such changes can lead to improvements in cellular energy homeostasis and reduced metabolic inflammation. Importantly, MSDC-0602K is classified as “PPARγ-sparing” because it demonstrates substantially lower direct binding to PPARγ compared to classical TZDs, thereby mitigating the transcriptional activation of adipogenic genes and the subsequent unwanted side effects like fluid retention and weight gain (Colca, 2015, p. 12; Huang et al., 2024, pp. 11–12). At the molecular level, the inhibition of MPC by MSDC-0602K decreases the availability of pyruvate for mitochondrial oxidation, thereby limiting the TCA cycle flux and lowering the production of acetyl-CoA and ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic stress, in turn, increases the AMP/ATP ratio, activating AMPK. The enhanced AMPK signaling upregulates glucose transporter translocation (e.g., of GLUT4) to the cell surface and improves downstream insulin receptor signaling through the PI3K/Akt cascade (Ferguson et al., 2023, pp. 18–22; McCommis & Finck, 2023, pp. 14–15). This provides a mechanistic underpinning for the observed improvements in insulin sensitivity in animal models and clinical studies. Moreover, studies have indicated that MPC modulation can influence the phosphorylation status of enzymes such as branched‐chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) and ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), though these aspects are more directly studied in the context of diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) than in ovarian tissue contexts (Kamm et al., 2020, pp. 14–17; Ferguson et al., 2023, pp. 12–14).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis driving the repurposing of MSDC-0602K for PCOS is that by inhibiting the MPC in ovarian theca cells, the drug will increase cytosolic redox states and activate AMPK, thereby enhancing downstream insulin receptor signaling (via the PI3K/Akt pathway) and restoring efficient glucose uptake. In PCOS, dysregulation of insulin signaling in ovarian cells is a key pathophysiological feature that contributes to hyperandrogenism, aberrant folliculogenesis, and metabolic dysfunction. The expected result in the assay is that treatment of theca cell models with MSDC-0602K will lead to an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio, elevated phosphorylation of AMPK, and, subsequently, an enhanced PI3K/Akt signal, all of which are pivotal for improving insulin sensitivity. Evidence from rodent models of T2DM and NASH—conditions that share underlying insulin resistance with PCOS—demonstrate that MPC inhibition by MSDC-0602K reverses hyperinsulinemia and reduces lipotoxicity, thereby normalizing insulin signaling cascades (Kamm et al., 2020, pp. 4–8; Colca et al., 2017, pp. 2–4). Although specific data in ovarian cell types are not yet published, it is reasonable to project from the hepatocyte and skeletal muscle data that in the ovarian theca cells, enhanced cytosolic redox status would counteract abnormal metabolic conditions. Furthermore, the PI3K/Akt pathway is known to be expressed in theca cells and plays an essential role in mediating insulin effects on these cells, including the regulation of steroidogenesis and glucose uptake. Therefore, in an in vitro assay, one would expect to observe improved insulin-mediated glucose uptake and normalization of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) signaling, as evidenced by enhanced Akt phosphorylation and increased GLUT transporter mobilization (Colca, 2015, pp. 9–11; Ferguson et al., 2023, pp. 9–12). In addition to the activation of AMPK, improved mitochondrial function and balanced substrate utilization may also reduce lipotoxic stress in ovarian tissues, potentially contributing to the re-establishment of normal cellular function and hormone synthesis pathways. These mechanisms collectively would work to restore the cellular metabolic environment, thereby ameliorating insulin resistance—a central feature of PCOS.

Overall Evaluation:
The potential of MSDC-0602K as a therapeutic candidate for PCOS is supported by a robust mechanistic rationale, a favorable preclinical and early clinical safety profile, and a known ability to improve insulin sensitivity through mitochondrial modulation while avoiding the side effects commonly associated with classical TZDs. One significant strength of MSDC-0602K is its dual capacity to modulate mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism and activate the AMPK signaling pathway, thereby enhancing insulin receptor signaling without provoking the PPARγ-related adverse effects. This is particularly relevant in PCOS, wherein insulin resistance directly contributes to hyperandrogenism and reproductive dysfunction. The extensive preclinical data demonstrating improved glycemic control, reduced hepatic steatosis, decreased hyperinsulinemia, and amelioration of lipotoxicity in established rodent models of T2DM and NAFLD lend strong support to its anticipated effectiveness in other insulin-resistant states such as PCOS (Colca, 2015, pp. 6–8; Benova et al., 2022, pp. 12–14).
Another strength is the existence of clinical data from phase II and phase III trials in metabolic diseases, which establish pharmacokinetics, dosing strategies, and a safety profile that expedite repurposing for additional indications (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022). The well-characterized mechanism of action—particularly the inhibition of MPC leading to increased cytosolic redox states and subsequent AMPK activation—provides a clear biological pathway that is likely to be relevant in the ovarian theca cell context. The PI3K/Akt pathway, which is critical in transducing insulin signals, is well documented in ovarian tissues, and improvements in this signaling cascade have the potential to restore normal glucose uptake and steroidogenesis (Ferguson et al., 2023, pp. 18–22; McCommis & Finck, 2023, pp. 14–15).

However, several weaknesses and challenges must be considered. First, while the insulin-sensitizing effects of MSDC-0602K are well documented in hepatic and muscle tissues, direct evidence of its effects in ovarian cell models—specifically in the context of PCOS—remains sparse. Dedicated studies on the expression and function of MPC and the downstream signaling pathways in PCOS theca cells are needed to confirm that the mechanisms observed in other tissues translate effectively to the ovarian microenvironment. Second, the balance between therapeutic inhibition of MPC and the possible deleterious effects on mitochondrial energy production needs further exploration. Although partial inhibition may beneficially shift substrate metabolism, excessive inhibition in tissues with high energy demands could potentially lead to unintended metabolic stress or compensatory mechanisms that mitigate the desired benefit. Third, while the compound has a favorable safety profile compared to classical TZDs, long-term safety specifically in reproductive-aged women with PCOS will need to be carefully documented, particularly concerning potential impacts on ovarian function and fertility. Additionally, there remains a possibility that compensatory metabolic pathways may be activated in response to chronic MPC inhibition, which could attenuate the sustained efficacy of the intervention over time. Lastly, while the clinical trials in T2DM and NASH provide important proof-of-concept data, the pathophysiological environment in PCOS—with its unique interplay of hyperinsulinemia, hyperandrogenism, and chronic low-grade inflammation—may require adjunct strategies alongside MPC inhibition to fully restore normal ovarian function (Yuan et al., 2022, pp. 1–3; Colca et al., 2017, pp. 2–4).

In summary, MSDC-0602K emerges as a very promising candidate for repurposing in PCOS due to its ability to modulate mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism, thereby activating AMPK and enhancing insulin signaling without the collateral side effects of direct PPARγ activation. The hypothesis that MDC-0602K will improve insulin receptor downstream PI3K/Akt signaling in PCOS theca cells by shifting cytosolic redox balance is well grounded in the extensive biomedical literature on its effects in T2DM and NASH. The compound’s known pharmacokinetics, safety profile, and mechanism of action provide a solid foundation for further preclinical exploration in ovarian cell models and eventual clinical trials focused on PCOS. Nonetheless, additional investigations are warranted to determine the precise metabolic and hormonal effects in ovarian tissues, to optimize dosing specific for reproductive indications, and to ensure that long-term administration in women produces sustained metabolic and reproductive improvements without adverse consequences. Overall, based on current literature evidence (Colca, 2015, pp. 5–6; Ferguson et al., 2023, pp. 18–22; Kamm et al., 2020, pp. 11–14; McCommis & Finck, 2023, pp. 14–15; Huang et al., 2024, pp. 11–12; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016), MSDC-0602K holds significant potential as a repurposed drug candidate for treating the metabolic dysfunction observed in PCOS, although further focused studies in ovarian-specific systems are essential to validate this therapeutic strategy thoroughly.

Dapagliflozin (AstraZeneca; SGLT2 inhibitor),"Proposal for Dapagliflozin (AstraZeneca; SGLT2 inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dapagliflozin is a synthetic, orally available small‐molecule inhibitor belonging to the sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor class developed originally for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This compound was discovered and optimized by AstraZeneca through a series of medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at deriving molecules capable of selectively inhibiting SGLT2, the transporter responsible for approximately 90% of renal glucose reabsorption. By competitively inhibiting the SGLT2 protein in the proximal renal tubule, dapagliflozin promotes glycosuria and thereby lowers plasma glucose levels via an insulin-independent mechanism (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Because its mechanism does not rely on pancreatic insulin secretion, dapagliflozin effectively reduces hyperglycemia even in patients with impaired beta-cell function. Over the years, dapagliflozin and its molecular family have been widely utilized to improve glycemic control in diabetic populations, as well as to confer additional cardioprotective and renoprotective benefits. The compound’s well-defined pharmacokinetics, including high oral bioavailability and a favorable once-daily dosing profile, make it an attractive candidate for repurposing into other metabolic conditions. In the case of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), there is a theoretical rationale whereby reducing systemic hyperinsulinemia with dapagliflozin may indirectly normalize ovarian steroidogenesis—a promising avenue given the limitations of existing therapies (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Rakic et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Dapagliflozin’s initial therapeutic use was in T2DM, where its role in reducing renal glucose reabsorption led to substantial glycemic benefits along with weight loss, reduced blood pressure, and decreased cardiovascular risk. Extensive clinical trials in diabetic populations have established its safety profile, delineating common adverse events such as genital mycotic infections and the very rare occurrences of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. Its clinical utility has also been extended to patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease, owing to its ability to favorably modify metabolic and hemodynamic parameters (Pruett et al., 2023). More recently, emerging clinical observations have indicated that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors in PCOS patients is accompanied by reductions in insulin resistance as measured by HOMA-IR, modest weight reduction, and improvements in androgen profiles—findings that parallel those observed with established agents such as metformin (Mrabet et al., 2024). Clinical trials conducted in women with PCOS, such as those registered under ClinicalTrials.gov (2016) and ClinicalTrials.gov (2024), have investigated combinations of dapagliflozin with other agents, as well as dapagliflozin monotherapy, to assess its impact on metabolic, endocrine, and reproductive endpoints. These trials have reported promising trends in improved insulin sensitivity and favorable changes in body composition, although the available data remain preliminary (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024). There is also supportive evidence from systematic reviews and small randomized trials that have compared dapagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors with metformin and GLP-1 receptor agonists in women with PCOS, indicating that the class effect might indeed offer benefits in managing hyperinsulinemia-driven hyperandrogenism, despite inter-study variability (Mrabet et al., 2024; Marinkovic-Radosevic et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
The therapeutic benefit of dapagliflozin is fundamentally rooted in its ability to inhibit the SGLT2 protein in the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney. At the molecular level, dapagliflozin binds to SGLT2 with high affinity and selectivity, thereby preventing the reabsorption of filtered glucose. This inhibition results in increased urinary glucose excretion (glycosuria), leading to a reduction in plasma glucose levels independently of insulin release. The ensuing reduction in blood glucose also diminishes the compensatory hyperinsulinemia that is a hallmark not only of T2DM but also of PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Unknown Reference).

In PCOS, hyperinsulinemia is a critical driver of ovarian dysfunction. Insulin directly augments the synthesis of androgens by stimulating the ovarian theca cells through activation of the insulin receptor and its downstream signaling cascades. Of particular note is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which is essential for insulin-mediated glucose uptake in granulosa cells. In the hyperinsulinemic state commonly seen in PCOS, granulosa cells exhibit impaired insulin receptor (IR) sensitivity and diminished PI3K/Akt pathway activation, leading to suboptimal glucose uptake and follicular dysfunction (Rakic et al., 2023).

By reducing plasma insulin levels, dapagliflozin theoretically interrupts this pathological loop. A decrease in systemic hyperinsulinemia should translate into reduced insulin-mediated stimulation of the ovarian theca cells, thus lowering androgen production. Concurrently, lower circulating insulin levels may alleviate the chronic overstimulation of granulosa cells, promoting restoration of normal insulin receptor sensitivity and reactivation of the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade required for proper follicular development and ovulation (Rakic et al., 2023; Mrabet et al., 2024). Furthermore, preclinical studies, such as those conducted in rodent models, have provided evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors can mitigate inflammation and improve mitochondrial function in tissues relevant to metabolic control, which indirectly supports ovarian metabolic health (Zhang et al., 2024). Although direct molecular evidence detailing the effects of dapagliflozin on the ovarian theca and granulosa cells remains sparse, the compound’s established metabolic actions and animal model findings strongly suggest potential downstream restoration of normal ovarian insulin signaling—particularly via PI3K/Akt pathways (Rakic et al., 2023).

Expected Effect:
In the context of the proposed hypothesis, the expected effect of dapagliflozin in PCOS centers on its ability to diminish systemic hyperinsulinemia, thereby decreasing insulin-driven androgen production in theca cells. As insulin acts synergistically with luteinizing hormone (LH) to stimulate theca cell steroidogenesis, a reduction in circulating insulin should theoretically lead to lower levels of circulating androgens, including total testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) (Mrabet et al., 2024; Rakic et al., 2023). In clinical settings, patients with PCOS treated with SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated improvements in metabolic parameters such as body weight reduction and enhanced insulin sensitivity, reflected in improved HOMA-IR scores. These metabolic benefits are anticipated to translate into endocrine improvements; specifically, lower insulin concentrations may reduce the hyperstimulation of ovarian theca cells, thereby decreasing androgen excess—a central driver of both reproductive and metabolic dysfunction in PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Mrabet et al., 2024).

The indirect effect on granulosa cells is equally significant. Granulosa cells in PCOS have been documented to show impaired insulin action due to decreased sensitivity of the insulin receptor and disrupted PI3K/Akt signaling, which is responsible for glucose uptake necessary for follicular maturation. With dapagliflozin lowering systemic insulin levels, it is expected that the insulin receptors on granulosa cells may regain their responsiveness. Re-establishing normal PI3K/Akt-mediated glucose uptake is critical for restoring follicular function and thereby improving ovulation and menstrual regularity (Rakic et al., 2023). In animal models, improvements in ovulatory function and normalized LH secretion have been observed with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, lending further support to the expected reproductive benefits in PCOS (Zhang et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025). Thus, the overall expected effects of dapagliflozin in PCOS are dual-pronged: targeting the metabolic derangements by reducing hyperinsulinemia and weight, while also addressing the reproductive dysfunction by indirectly reducing androgen production and restoring granulosa cell insulin sensitivity.

Overall Evaluation:
Dapagliflozin emerges as a promising repurposing candidate for the treatment of PCOS on several fronts. The strengths of this therapeutic candidate include its established mechanism of action, well-characterized safety and pharmacokinetic profile, and documented beneficial effects on glycemic control and weight reduction in diabetic populations. The compound’s insulin-independent mode of action—mediated via SGLT2 inhibition—effectively lowers plasma glucose and, consequently, plasma insulin levels. In PCOS, where hyperinsulinemia is a major pathogenic driver of both metabolic and reproductive dysfunction, this reduction has the potential to decrease insulin-mediated androgen synthesis in ovarian theca cells, which is a unique mechanism compared to existing insulin sensitizers such as metformin (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Rakic et al., 2023).

Additionally, clinical trials and systematic reviews have provided preliminary evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin, are associated with improvements in metabolic parameters such as weight loss and HOMA-IR indices in PCOS patients (Mrabet et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024). These metabolic improvements are significant, as they address the underlying insulin resistance that not only contributes to hyperandrogenism but also predisposes patients to long-term cardiovascular and metabolic disease. The cardiometabolic benefits observed with dapagliflozin in other patient cohorts further strengthen the rationale for its use in PCOS, a condition that carries an increased risk for cardiovascular complications (Pruett et al., 2023).

Mechanistically, while direct evidence of dapagliflozin’s effects on ovarian cellular signaling (specifically regarding the PI3K/Akt pathway in granulosa cells) remains limited, the overall rationale is compelling. By lowering systemic insulin levels, dapagliflozin should alleviate the excessive activation of insulin receptors on ovarian theca cells, thereby reducing the insulin-mediated overproduction of androgens—a key factor in PCOS pathogenesis. Furthermore, improved insulin sensitivity in granulosa cells could restore normal glucose uptake and follicular maturation, potentially improving ovulatory function and menstrual regularity (Rakic et al., 2023; Mrabet et al., 2024). Preclinical models offer supportive evidence for these effects, though more direct studies in human ovarian cells are needed.

On the safety side, dapagliflozin’s adverse event profile is well known from its use in T2DM, with common issues being manageable genitourinary infections and rare occurrences of ketoacidosis. Given that the metabolic and endocrine dysfunctions in PCOS overlap significantly with those seen in diabetic populations, the favorable safety profile in the latter provides confidence for repurposing—provided that vigilance is maintained for any differential effects in a reproductive-aged, non-diabetic population (Rakic et al., 2023; Mrabet et al., 2024).

However, there are several weaknesses and uncertainties associated with dapagliflozin’s repurposing for PCOS. The number of well-powered, long-term clinical trials investigating its impact specifically on reproductive endpoints in PCOS patients is limited. Existing studies often comprise small sample sizes and show variability in hormonal outcomes, with some trials reporting nonsignificant changes in hyperandrogenism when compared to established treatments like metformin (Mrabet et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Another concern is the lack of direct mechanistic studies in ovarian tissues, leaving a gap in our understanding of how effectively dapagliflozin may restore insulin receptor function and PI3K/Akt signaling in granulosa cells. This mechanistic gap necessitates further preclinical research to clearly demonstrate its impact at the cellular level (Rakic et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2025).

Additionally, clinical heterogeneity in PCOS—stemming from variable diagnostic criteria (Rotterdam versus NIH), patient BMI, baseline insulin resistance, and differences in metabolic phenotypes—could influence the response to dapagliflozin. Thus, while the hypothesized benefits are promising, careful patient selection and stratification will be essential for any clinical trial evaluating this candidate in PCOS. Furthermore, while the overall safety profile is positive, special consideration must be given to the potential reproductive and long-term endocrine effects in a population where fertility and ovarian function are of paramount concern (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Mrabet et al., 2024).

In summary, dapagliflozin represents a potentially transformative therapeutic candidate for PCOS, leveraging its ability to reduce systemic hyperinsulinemia and thereby address a central pathogenetic mechanism of the syndrome. Its strengths lie in its proven metabolic benefits, robust safety record in diabetes and heart failure populations, and the clear biochemical rationale linking insulin reduction to decreased ovarian androgen production and improved insulin sensitivity in granulosa cells. Weaknesses include the current paucity of direct mechanistic data in ovarian tissue, variability in clinical outcomes from early studies, and the need for larger, well-controlled clinical trials to firmly establish its efficacy and safety specific to PCOS. Given these considerations, dapagliflozin is a promising candidate that warrants further targeted investigation both preclinically and clinically to validate its role as a repurposed treatment for PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Mrabet et al., 2024; Rakic et al., 2023; Pruett et al., 2023).

BGP-15 (N-desmethyltacrolimus; Active Biochem catalog #A-3010),"Proposal for BGP-15 (N-desmethyltacrolimus; Active Biochem catalog #A-3010)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
BGP-15, also known as N-desmethyltacrolimus, is a small molecule pharmacological agent originally developed as an insulin sensitizer with a unique profile based on its ability to upregulate heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72). It is synthetically derived from tacrolimus by removal of a methyl group, resulting in a compound with distinct immunomodulatory and chaperone-inducing properties. As a nicotinic amidoxime derivative, BGP-15 belongs to a class of non-steroidal, low molecular weight compounds that modulate cellular stress responses via the heat shock pathway. The synthetic origins of BGP-15 involve modification of macrolide immunosuppressants to both reduce immunosuppressive activity and enhance its potential as a cytoprotective agent by promoting molecular chaperone expression. Within its class, these compounds have been explored primarily for their ability to protect cells against various metabolic stresses, improve mitochondrial physiology, and enhance insulin receptor signaling in different tissues. This approach—to repurpose an agent once investigated for ischemia–reperfusion injury and other stress‐related conditions for metabolic diseases such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)—demonstrates innovation in drug repurposing strategies by leveraging established safety and pharmacokinetic profiles obtained in earlier phase clinical studies (Artasensi, 2022; Pető et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, BGP-15 has undergone extensive preclinical evaluation in animal models of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and cardiac dysfunction. Preclinical studies in various rodent models—including Zucker obese, Goto-Kakizaki, and cholesterol-fed rabbits—have demonstrated its ability to improve insulin sensitivity and ameliorate metabolic disturbances, effects that are mediated in part by induction of Hsp72 and inhibition of stress kinases. Clinical phase II trials in insulin-resistant patients have established a favorable safety profile and predictable pharmacokinetics when administered orally, thereby supporting its continued development as an insulin sensitizer. Although BGP-15 has not been exclusively studied in a large cohort of PCOS patients, considerable indirect evidence exists from clinical trials that have evaluated metabolic endpoints relevant to PCOS—for example, improvements in glucose uptake and reductions in systemic inflammatory markers have been documented in populations with insulin resistance. The compound has also been investigated in contexts where atypical antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects were prominent, further highlighting its capacity to mitigate insulin resistance and dyslipidemia through Hsp72 induction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Literáti-Nagy et al., 2012; Pető et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of BGP-15 is multifaceted and centers on its ability to function as a heat shock protein co-inducer. At the molecular level, BGP-15 facilitates the stabilization and activity of heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1), which is the principal transcriptional activator of stress-inducible heat shock proteins such as Hsp72. Once induced, Hsp72 acts as a molecular chaperone that improves proteostasis by assisting in proper protein folding and by preventing the aggregation or degradation of critical proteins, such as components of the insulin receptor complex. Moreover, Hsp72 stabilizes the insulin receptor by protecting insulin receptor substrates from stress-induced degradation; this is crucial in tissues like the ovary where insulin signaling is required to maintain metabolic and endocrine balance. In addition to these chaperoning functions, BGP-15 has been shown to inhibit the activation of stress kinases, notably c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). JNK activation, which is typically elevated under conditions of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, promotes serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS), thereby inhibiting insulin signal transduction. By suppressing JNK activity, BGP-15 facilitates the preservation of IRS integrity and enables effective downstream signaling via the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. This signaling cascade is essential for the translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter to the plasma membrane—a step that is directly linked to insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Biochemical studies in animal models have demonstrated that by inducing Hsp72 and decreasing JNK activity, BGP-15 leads to enhanced GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface in insulin-responsive tissues, resulting in improved glucose uptake and overall metabolic homeostasis (Artasensi, 2022; Literáti-Nagy et al., 2014; Pető et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis in our proposal is that BGP-15 will induce Hsp72 in ovarian cells affected by PCOS, thereby stabilizing the insulin receptor and preventing its degradation under conditions of cellular stress. In PCOS, insulin resistance is a pivotal pathogenic feature that contributes to hyperinsulinemia and subsequent ovarian dysfunction, including aberrant androgen production. By enhancing the expression of Hsp72, BGP-15 is expected to protect the insulin receptor from stress-induced phosphorylation events mediated by JNK, consequently reinstating effective insulin signal transduction through the PI3K/Akt pathway. An improved PI3K/Akt signaling cascade would promote GLUT4 translocation and augment glucose uptake, thus correcting the underlying insulin resistance commonly observed in PCOS. Preclinical rodent models have shown that BGP-15 administration can result in improved insulin sensitivity not only systemically but also in tissues such as the ovary, where restoration of insulin receptor stability might contribute to improved ovarian function and reduction in hyperandrogenism. Although direct assays in isolated ovarian cells from PCOS patients remain to be performed, available data confirm that insulin receptor and GLUT4 expression are notably affected in PCOS, providing an ideal context wherein Hsp72 induction by BGP-15 could exert beneficial effects. Evidence from studies in metabolic contexts indicates that these heat shock proteins—particularly Hsp72—are expressed in ovarian tissues and their upregulation correlates with improved cellular stress responses and glucose metabolism. Thus, we anticipate that treatment with BGP-15 will lead to a reduction in JNK activation, enhanced insulin receptor signalling, and improved ovarian insulin sensitivity, which in turn might ameliorate the endocrine imbalances associated with PCOS (Niinuma et al., 2023; Pető et al., 2020; Sára, 2012).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of BGP-15 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for PCOS is highly promising based on its comprehensive preclinical and early clinical data. Among the strengths of BGP-15 is its well-characterized mechanism of action centered on Hsp72 induction, which directly addresses a key aspect of PCOS pathophysiology—insulin resistance arising from defective insulin receptor stability and subsequent impairment of downstream signaling cascades. Preclinical evidence supports that BGP-15 improves insulin sensitivity by stabilizing the receptor, reducing stress kinase (JNK) activity, and enhancing GLUT4 translocation, a mechanistic package that is particularly relevant in the context of PCOS where ovarian insulin resistance plays a central role. Additionally, early clinical studies have demonstrated that BGP-15 possesses a favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile in humans, thereby reducing the translational risk associated with repurposing. The compound’s prior investigations in other insulin-resistant conditions, along with its documented efficacy in animal models of metabolic syndrome and diabetes, add further support to its potential utility for treating PCOS (Literáti-Nagy et al., 2014; Mittermayer et al., 2015; Pető et al., 2020).

A notable advantage of BGP-15 is that its mechanism—that of enhancing cellular chaperone systems rather than acting through receptor agonism or inhibition of metabolic enzymes—does not overlap with the adverse cardiovascular and hepatic side effects that have been problematic for other insulin sensitizers, such as thiazolidinediones. By targeting fundamental cellular stress response pathways, BGP-15 may offer a more sustainable improvement in insulin sensitivity without the significant safety liabilities observed with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists. The compound’s ability to modulate JNK activity is particularly encouraging because JNK is a critical mediator of inflammation and insulin resistance, both of which contribute to the ovarian dysfunction seen in PCOS (Henstridge et al., 2014).

However, several challenges remain. While the preclinical animal data are supportive and the safety data from phase II studies in human insulin-resistant populations are encouraging, direct evidence of efficacy in PCOS-specific models or in women with PCOS is limited. Although there are indications from clinical trial databases and related metabolic studies that BGP-15 is being evaluated for metabolic disturbances relevant to PCOS, dedicated clinical studies in PCOS populations will be necessary to confirm its therapeutic benefit in terms of both metabolic and endocrine endpoints. In addition, although the mechanistic rationale is compelling, the precise molecular events in ovarian tissues—including the potential effects on steroidogenesis and follicular dynamics—need to be more thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, the extent of Hsp72 upregulation required to produce a clinically significant improvement in insulin receptor function and ovarian insulin sensitivity remains to be defined. Another potential weakness is that while the drug has been shown to enhance GLUT4 translocation in peripheral tissues, ovarian cells might have distinct signaling dynamics that could limit the translatability of systemic findings to ovarian function. Finally, while adverse effects have not emerged as intractable issues in previous studies, long-term safety and pharmacokinetics specifically in a reproductive-aged female population must be rigorously assessed (Levente, 2013; Takahashi et al., 2017).

In summary, BGP-15 presents a strong candidate for repurposing for PCOS treatment owing to its novel chaperone-based mechanism which targets the underlying insulin resistance that drives many of the endocrine disturbances in PCOS. Its capacity to induce Hsp72, thereby stabilizing the insulin receptor, reducing JNK activation, and facilitating PI3K/Akt-mediated GLUT4 translocation, offers a mechanistically sound approach to restoring metabolic and potentially reproductive function. The preclinical studies across rodent models, along with clinical phase II data demonstrating safety and favorable pharmacokinetic properties, provide a solid foundation for advancing BGP-15 into further clinical evaluation specifically targeting PCOS. Future work should focus on detailed mechanistic studies in ovarian cell models from PCOS patients, as well as carefully designed, controlled clinical trials in this population to validate efficacy endpoints beyond general insulin sensitization, including improvements in ovulatory function, androgen levels, and overall reproductive outcomes (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Niinuma et al., 2023; Pető et al., 2020).

Overall, the strengths of BGP-15 lie in its innovative mode of action, established safety in early clinical trials, and preclinical evidence of metabolic benefits, while its weaknesses include the current lack of direct clinical evidence in the specific PCOS population and uncertainty about the detailed ovarian molecular response to Hsp72 induction. However, given the significant need for improved insulin sensitizers in PCOS and the promising mechanistic rationale, BGP-15 merits further targeted investigation and clinical validation as a novel therapeutic candidate for PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Henstridge et al., 2014; Pető et al., 2020).

Trodusquemine (MSI-1436; Tocris Bioscience catalog #5993),"Proposal for Trodusquemine (MSI-1436; Tocris Bioscience catalog #5993)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate: Trodusquemine (MSI‐1436) is a naturally derived aminosterol originally isolated from the dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias) and subsequently characterized for its multiple biomedical activities. Its discovery emanated from marine natural product research, where compounds such as squalamine and trodusquemine were identified for their unique structure comprising a steroid skeleton conjugated with a polyamine moiety. In trodusquemine the polyamine component is specifically a spermine side chain, which confers a higher positive charge relative to its close analogue squalamine, where a spermidine is present; this structural difference significantly enhances membrane interactions and impacts its biological function (Babak & Ahn, 2021; Barbut et al., 2024). Trodusquemine belongs to the aminosterol class of compounds—a group that has been historically investigated for antimicrobial, neuroprotective, and metabolic regulatory effects. Over time, this class has been repurposed and optimized to target key regulatory enzymes involved in metabolism, with trodusquemine emerging as a potent, selective, and reversible allosteric inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) (Kyriakou, 2017; Limbocker et al., 2022). Its manufacturing has been facilitated by both natural extraction and synthetic approaches that allow systematic chemical modifications in search of improved pharmacokinetic properties, an approach that has generated analogues like DPM-1001 with enhanced oral bioavailability while maintaining a similar mechanism of action (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Négrel & Brunel, 2021).

Therapeutic History: Biochemically, trodusquemine has been studied broadly in the context of obesity, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. Preclinical studies in rodents have shown that it acts to reduce food intake, bring about fat-specific weight loss, improve insulin sensitivity, and reverse hepatic steatosis by ameliorating insulin resistance at both peripheral and central levels, as documented in diet-induced obese and genetically obese mouse models (Lantz et al., 2010; Maccari & Ottanà, 2023). Its effectiveness in improving insulin receptor phosphorylation is attributed to its inhibition of PTP1B—a well-validated negative regulator of insulin and leptin signaling pathways—thus restoring downstream signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway (Barbut et al., 2024; He et al., 2012). Clinically, trodusquemine has been evaluated in Phase I trials primarily focused on type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, in which it demonstrated promising safety and pharmacokinetic profiles (Genaera Corporation, 2008; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, in oncology settings trodusquemine has been examined for its potential anticancer properties, particularly in HER2-positive breast cancer, given the role of PTP1B in tumorigenic signaling (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Kyriakou, 2017). Despite extensive investigation into its metabolic and neuroprotective benefits, there is no published record of trodusquemine being explicitly trialed for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) or ovarian insulin resistance; however, the shared metabolic derangements in insulin-resistant tissues suggest a promising opportunity to explore its efficacy in PCOS-related contexts (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action: The therapeutic mechanism of trodusquemine is rooted in its allosteric inhibition of PTP1B, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates insulin and leptin receptors, attenuating downstream metabolic signaling. Biochemical studies have precisely mapped its binding to non-catalytic regions of PTP1B, particularly involving the C-terminal helix α9 and a secondary site near helix α7, where its binding induces conformational changes that stabilize an inactive enzyme conformation (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Babak & Ahn, 2021). This allosteric mode of inhibition avoids the challenges encountered with active site-directed inhibitors that often suffer from poor bioavailability due to the highly charged nature of the catalytic site and the need for phosphotyrosine mimetics (He et al., 2012; Limbocker et al., 2022). In addition, trodusquemine interacts with cellular membranes due to its amphipathic and cationic nature, enabling it not only to modulate PTP1B activity in the cytosol but also to affect membrane properties, which may indirectly decrease insulin resistance by influencing receptor localization and function (Barbut et al., 2024; Capitini et al., 2022). On a molecular level, when PTP1B is inhibited, the insulin receptor (IR) remains phosphorylated for longer periods, thereby amplifying downstream PI3K/Akt signaling which is critical for glucose uptake mediated by GLUT4 translocation in insulin-sensitive tissues (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Lantz et al., 2010). This mechanism has been well documented in various in vivo and in vitro models where enhanced phosphorylation of the IR and downstream targets was observed after trodusquemine treatment (Barbut et al., 2024; Kyriakou, 2017). Given that insulin resistance is a central pathophysiological mechanism in PCOS, and that granulosa cells from PCOS ovaries exhibit altered insulin signaling with upregulated PTP1B activity, the hypothesized effect is well supported by the detailed biochemical interactions of trodusquemine (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Limbocker et al., 2019).

Expected Effect: The proposed hypothesis is that trodusquemine will selectively inhibit PTP1B in PCOS-derived granulosa cells, which should consequently enhance insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and activate downstream PI3K/Akt signaling. This cascade is expected to improve GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake, thereby alleviating ovarian insulin resistance—a critical component of PCOS pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical animal models and cell-based assays have already demonstrated that trodusquemine’s inhibition of PTP1B results in improved insulin sensitivity, reduced ER stress, and favorable metabolic outcomes, including significant weight loss and enhanced hepatic and muscle insulin signaling (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Barbut et al., 2024). In the specific case of PCOS, ovarian granulosa cells play a pivotal role in folliculogenesis and steroid hormone production, and dysregulation of insulin signaling in these cells is linked to aberrant follicle development and anovulation. By enhancing insulin receptor phosphorylation and promoting effective downstream signaling in these cells, trodusquemine could restore normal glucose handling and cellular metabolism, which would be a significant therapeutic advance for PCOS management (Barbut et al., 2024; Maccari & Ottanà, 2023). Furthermore, granulosa cells are known to express PTP1B, and its inhibition has been correlated with improved insulin sensitivity in other tissues; therefore, similar effects in granulosa cells can be anticipated based on these mechanistic findings (Kyriakou, 2017; Négrel & Brunel, 2021).

Overall Evaluation: In evaluating trodusquemine for repurposing in PCOS, several strengths and challenges emerge. Among the primary strengths is the robust evidence supporting trodusquemine’s role as a selective allosteric inhibitor of PTP1B, with a well-characterized mechanism of action that enhances insulin receptor signaling and downstream PI3K/Akt pathway activity. This property directly addresses the insulin resistance observed in PCOS ovarian tissues, as increased PTP1B activity is known to negatively impact insulin signaling (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Babak & Ahn, 2021). Additionally, the extensive preclinical studies demonstrating favorable safety, tolerability, and efficacy in metabolic disease models—combined with early-phase clinical trial data in obesity and diabetes—provide significant translational potential for trodusquemine in a new indication such as PCOS (Genaera Corporation, 2008; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The compound’s membrane-active properties and its ability to engage with intracellular targets effectively further support its potential to ameliorate complex metabolic dysfunctions in ovarian cells (Capitini et al., 2022; Barbut et al., 2024).

In terms of weaknesses, the primary gap in the current body of literature is the lack of direct evidence for trodusquemine’s efficacy in PCOS or ovarian insulin resistance specifically, with most studies focused on diabetes, obesity, and neurodegenerative conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Maccari & Ottanà, 2023). Moreover, the unique physiology of ovarian granulosa cells and their microenvironment may introduce nuances that differ from systemic or hepatic insulin resistance, necessitating dedicated studies to confirm the mechanistic hypothesis in this cell type (Barbut et al., 2024; Limbocker et al., 2022). There is also a need to elucidate the compound’s long-term effects on ovarian steroidogenesis and follicular development, as any negative impact on these processes could potentially limit its clinical utility in PCOS patients. Additionally, while the preclinical safety profile is encouraging, the translation of these findings to the ovarian context requires careful dose optimization and pharmacodynamic evaluation to avoid off-target effects or adverse impacts on reproductive function (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Kyriakou, 2017).

Overall, trodusquemine represents a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of PCOS, particularly given the crucial role of insulin resistance in the pathophysiology of the syndrome. Its selective allosteric inhibition of PTP1B is directly relevant to improving insulin receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling—a mechanism that, if successfully translated to PCOS-derived granulosa cells, could restore normal metabolic function and improve clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, further targeted preclinical studies using ovarian cell lines and in vivo PCOS models are essential to validate this hypothesis and define optimal therapeutic parameters. In conclusion, based on the extensive literature spanning its molecular discovery, biochemical characterization, and robust preclinical evaluation in related metabolic disorders, trodusquemine holds considerable potential as a novel therapeutic candidate for PCOS, albeit with the current caveat that direct ovarian studies are required to substantiate its effectiveness in this specific indication (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Barbut et al., 2024; Kyriakou, 2017).

Anakinra (Kineret; IL-1 receptor antagonist),"Proposal for Anakinra (Kineret; IL-1 receptor antagonist)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Anakinra, marketed as Kineret, is a recombinant formulation of the endogenous interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) originally isolated from human urine and later produced via recombinant DNA technology. It belongs to the class of biologic anti-inflammatory compounds designed to inhibit interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling. This drug was discovered based on the observation that a naturally occurring inhibitor of IL-1 could counteract the deleterious effects of excessive IL-1 activity in inflammatory diseases. Anakinra is synthesized recombinantly in Escherichia coli and subsequently purified, maintaining the crucial non-glycosylated structure similar to the native IL-1 receptor antagonist. Biologically, the compound functions by binding competitively to the interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1), effectively blocking the binding of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β, thereby mitigating downstream inflammatory signaling cascades. This therapeutic class, cytokine blockers, has been widely used for treating chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, and other autoinflammatory disorders, and has additionally found applications in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes by addressing IL-1–driven systemic inflammation (Popovic, 2021; Dinarello, 2014).

Therapeutic History:
Anakinra has an extensive therapeutic history, initially approved for rheumatoid arthritis and several autoinflammatory conditions. Its clinical efficacy in damping inflammatory responses has been demonstrated by its ability to lower systemic inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and to improve overall clinical symptoms in patients with these conditions (Popovic, 2021; Cavalli & Dinarello, 2018). Clinical trials have also explored its role in metabolic diseases, notably in type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, where IL-1–mediated inflammation contributes to islet β-cell demise and insulin resistance. Recent clinical investigations have even extended to repurposing anakinra in conditions characterized by low-grade chronic inflammation and insulin resistance, such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). In fact, emerging clinical trial data, including the FertIL trial (NCT03578497), have assessed the effects of IL-1 receptor antagonism in women with PCOS, indicating that while systemic inflammation is reduced, changes in hyperandrogenemia and ovarian steroidogenesis are more complex (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; Popovic, 2021). Although the direct application of anakinra in PCOS has not yet been widely adopted, preclinical and early clinical findings suggest a promising potential for this drug candidate in modulating ovarian inflammation and possibly improving insulin sensitivity in PCOS patients (Popovic, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
Anakinra exerts its therapeutic action by mimicking the biological activity of the natural interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. At a molecular level, anakinra binds to IL-1R1 with high affinity, thereby preventing IL-1β—and to a lesser extent, IL-1α—from engaging its receptor. The binding of IL-1β to its receptor normally initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling events mediated by adaptor proteins such as MyD88, leading to the activation of inflammatory kinases including IκB kinase (IKK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). These kinases then stimulate transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP-1, which promote the transcription of numerous inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other mediators that exacerbate insulin resistance and tissue inflammation (Dinarello, 2011; Cavalli & Dinarello, 2018). By blocking IL-1R1, anakinra effectively interrupts this signaling pathway, thereby reducing the phosphorylation and activation of downstream kinases like IKK and JNK. In the context of ovarian tissue, where IL-1β is known to be elevated in the follicular fluid and to influence both granulosa and theca cell function, this blockade is expected to diminish serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). This reduction is critical because abnormal IRS-1 serine phosphorylation is a well-recognized mechanism that impairs insulin receptor signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway, ultimately leading to reduced glucose uptake. In summary, the biochemical and molecular interactions of anakinra involve antagonizing the detrimental effects of IL-1β-driven inflammation by preventing the initiation of inflammatory kinase cascades and preserving normal insulin signaling (Dinarello, 2014; Cavalli & Dinarello, 2018; Popovic, 2021).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the repurposing of anakinra in PCOS is that blockade of IL-1 signaling in ovarian tissues will attenuate the inflammatory milieu that contributes to insulin resistance within the ovary. Specifically, in PCOS, IL-1β is elevated in the follicular fluid, where it can stimulate inflammatory responses that activate kinases such as JNK and IKK. These kinases subsequently phosphorylate IRS-1 on serine residues, thereby inhibiting the normal insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway that is essential for glucose uptake. In an in vitro ovarian cell culture assay involving granulosa and theca cells, it is expected that anakinra will reduce the activity of these inflammatory kinases. This effect should, in turn, lead to a decrease in aberrant IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, thereby preserving or even enhancing the downstream signaling cascade mediated by the insulin receptor, PI3K, and Akt. This improvement in insulin signal transduction will likely promote increased translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane and facilitate greater glucose uptake, which is important for normal cellular function in both granulosa and theca cells. The gene expression profiles of these ovarian cells show that components of the insulin signaling cascade, including IRS-1, PI3K, and Akt, are physiologically expressed and crucial for steroidogenesis and metabolic regulation; hence, targeting IL-1 mediated inflammation with anakinra could positively influence these processes (Popovic, 2021; Yang et al., 2019). Moreover, reduction in local inflammation is anticipated to improve overall ovarian function, which may help restore normal folliculogenesis and ovulatory patterns in women with PCOS, addressing both metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions.

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating anakinra as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for PCOS, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. One of the primary strengths is the well-documented role of IL-1β in driving inflammatory processes that contribute to systemic and tissue-specific insulin resistance. Given that PCOS is often characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, particularly in ovarian tissues where IL-1β is elevated, targeting this cytokine represents a scientifically valid approach to ameliorate ovarian insulin resistance. The extensive therapeutic history of anakinra in other inflammatory and metabolic conditions, along with its established pharmacokinetic and safety profile, reinforces its candidacy for repurposing (Popovic, 2021; Dinarello, 2014). Additionally, the proposed mechanism of action—whereby anakinra is expected to reduce inflammatory kinase activation (JNK, IKK), decrease IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, and preserve insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt signaling—is well supported by prior biochemical studies demonstrating the central role of IL-1β in these processes (Dinarello, 2011; Cavalli & Dinarello, 2018).

A significant advantage is that anakinra has already been evaluated in related metabolic contexts and has shown beneficial effects on inflammatory markers and beta-cell function in type 2 diabetes, even if systemic insulin sensitivity improvements were modest (van Asseldonk et al., 2011). This suggests that its anti-inflammatory effects can translate into measurable metabolic improvements. The novel aspect of this repurposing strategy involves applying anakinra directly to ovarian cell cultures, such as granulosa and theca cells, wherein the inflammatory isoforms of IL-1β contribute to local insulin resistance—a mechanism that has not yet been thoroughly explored but represents a compelling therapeutic target (Popovic, 2021).

However, there are weaknesses and challenges that warrant careful consideration. The clinical trial data evaluating anakinra in PCOS are still preliminary, and the FertIL trial (NCT03578497) has shown that while systemic inflammatory markers like CRP are reduced, the effects on ovarian steroidogenesis and androgen levels are not straightforward. In some cases, transient increases in androgens have been observed, suggesting that IL-1 blockade might have complex effects on ovarian endocrine function (Popovic, 2021). This complexity underscores the need for longer-duration studies and a more nuanced understanding of IL-1 signaling in ovarian physiology.

Furthermore, while the biochemical rationale for improved insulin signaling via reduced phosphorylation of IRS-1 is convincing, direct in vitro studies using ovarian cell cultures are currently limited. It remains to be established whether the suppression of inflammatory kinase activity by anakinra will translate robustly into enhanced PI3K/Akt activity and glucose uptake in granulosa and theca cells. Additional mechanistic studies examining the downstream effects of IL-1 blockade on insulin signaling components in ovarian tissue are necessary to validate the expected effects (Popovic, 2021; Yang et al., 2019).

Another potential limitation is related to the pharmacodynamics of anakinra. Its short half-life necessitates daily subcutaneous injections, which might pose challenges for long-term compliance in a chronic condition like PCOS. Moreover, injection site reactions have been observed in clinical studies, which could limit its tolerability or affect overall efficacy, particularly if such reactions lead to incomplete IL-1 blockade or rebound inflammatory responses (Popovic, 2021).

Overall, the repurposing of anakinra for PCOS is scientifically compelling, given the established role of IL-1β in mediating ovarian inflammation and insulin resistance. The candidate benefits from a robust therapeutic history, a well-understood mechanism of action, and indirect evidence of efficacy in metabolic disorders characterized by similar inflammatory processes. However, care must be taken in interpreting early clinical trial data and in designing further studies to address issues such as dosing duration, patient selection (ideally those with high baseline inflammatory markers), and detailed mechanistic endpoints in ovarian cell models.

In conclusion, while there are potential challenges—including the complexity of ovarian steroidogenesis modulation, dosing regimen concerns, and the need for direct in vitro data—the overall evaluation is positive. The hypothesis that anakinra blockade of IL-1 signaling in PCOS ovarian tissues can reduce activation of inflammatory kinases (JNK, IKK), decrease IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, and thereby enhance insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt-driven glucose uptake in cell types critical for ovarian function (granulosa and theca cells) is strongly supported by current scientific literature. This candidate presents a promising avenue for further research and clinical investigation as a novel therapeutic strategy to address inflammation-mediated insulin resistance in PCOS (Popovic, 2021; Dinarello, 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA; Sigma-Aldrich catalog #P21005),"Proposal for 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA; Sigma-Aldrich catalog #P21005)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
4‐Phenylbutyric acid (4‐PBA) is a synthetic fatty acid derivative that was originally developed more than a century ago through chemical modification of butyric acid; this was achieved by introducing an aromatic phenyl residue into the butyric acid backbone via reaction processes involving benzene and butyrolactone in the presence of aluminum chloride (He & Moreau, 2019). The addition of the phenyl group not only distinguishes 4‐PBA from naturally occurring butyrate but also enhances its pharmacokinetic properties by increasing its half‐life and stability. This compound belongs to a class of molecules known as short‐chain fatty acid derivatives, which have been repurposed over the years from their initial use in rare metabolic conditions to broader applications in metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as protein misfolding disorders. Importantly, 4‐PBA functions as a chemical chaperone, a role that involves entering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and facilitating the correct folding of nascent proteins, thereby reducing the accumulation of misfolded proteins that trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR) (He & Moreau, 2019). Besides its chemical chaperone properties, 4‐PBA also exhibits weak histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory activity when used at higher doses, a secondary mechanism that may modulate gene expression via epigenetic pathways. Its dual role in promoting proper protein folding and modifying gene expression has established 4‐PBA as a versatile molecule. In clinical practice, its utility is most evident in its FDA‐approved indication for treating urea cycle disorders, where it acts as an ammonia scavenger. The extensive clinical experience and well‐characterized absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profiles of 4‐PBA underscore its potential for repurposing to new therapeutic indications such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) (He & Moreau, 2019; Kolb et al., 2015).

Therapeutic History
Clinically, 4‐PBA has a storied history of application that began with its use in metabolic detoxification disorders. In patients with urea cycle disorders, the compound acts by converting itself through beta‐oxidation into active metabolites that conjugate with glutamine, ultimately forming phenylacetylglutamine—a metabolite that is efficiently excreted by the kidneys. This ammonia‐scavenging process has been the cornerstone of its clinical use, providing life-saving treatment for individuals suffering from hyperammonemia (Kolb et al., 2015). Over time, the therapeutic potential of 4‐PBA has been explored across a continuum of diseases characterized by ER stress. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that 4‐PBA can alleviate ER stress not only in hepatocytes and pancreatic β‐cells but also in adipocytes and neuronal cells. For instance, in experimental models of diabetes and obesity, 4‐PBA was shown to reduce markers of ER stress and improve insulin sensitivity (Liong & Lappas, 2015; Khan et al., 2017). Such studies have provided evidence that when ER stress is mitigated, there is a subsequent improvement in insulin receptor signaling and metabolic regulation, aspects that are critical in disorders marked by insulin resistance. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, 4‐PBA has also been evaluated for its neuroprotective properties; experiments in various models (including those of Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases) have indicated that 4‐PBA can reduce ER stress–induced neuronal apoptosis and enhance cell survival (Mimori et al., 2017). Moreover, the compound’s quantification in cell culture media via methods like liquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry has further underscored its relevance in preclinical experimentation (Villani et al., 2023). Despite its broad experimental use, a search in clinical trial databases for “4-Phenylbutyric acid AND Polycystic Ovary Syndrome” reveals that there are currently no registered clinical trials directly evaluating its use in PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nonetheless, the pathophysiological similarities between PCOS and other metabolic disorders where 4‐PBA has shown beneficial effects provide a compelling rationale for exploring its use in PCOS. PCOS is characterized by insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and chronic cellular stress—all conditions that have been ameliorated by 4‐PBA in other settings (Chen et al., 2023; Kolb et al., 2015).

Mechanism of Action
The central mechanism of action for 4‐PBA revolves around its capacity to mitigate endoplasmic reticulum stress—a pathological state that arises when the protein-folding machinery of the ER is overwhelmed by an excess of misfolded proteins. Under normal circumstances, resident ER chaperones such as GRP78 (also known as BiP) assist in proper protein folding. However, in conditions of excessive stress, the accumulation of misfolded proteins initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is mediated by three primary transmembrane sensors: PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 (He & Moreau, 2019). The activation of PERK leads to the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), which in turn results in a transient reduction in global protein synthesis and the preferential translation of stress-related proteins such as CHOP—a pro-apoptotic transcription factor. Chronic activation of this pathway is associated with cellular dysfunction and apoptosis.

4‐PBA exerts its chaperoning function by directly enhancing the folding capacity of the ER; it effectively reduces the load of misfolded proteins, thereby dampening the activation of UPR sensors and the release of downstream effectors like CHOP (He & Moreau, 2019; Kolb et al., 2015). One of the major consequences of excessive ER stress is the activation of stress kinases such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Active JNK can phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) on specific serine residues, which impedes the normal tyrosine phosphorylation events required for effective insulin signal propagation through the PI3K/Akt pathway (Kolb et al., 2015; Khan et al., 2017). Under normal physiological conditions, insulin binding to its receptor triggers a signaling cascade that involves IRS-1 and ultimately leads to activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, facilitating glucose uptake in cells. However, when IRS-1 is aberrantly serine phosphorylated due to the action of JNK, insulin signaling becomes dysfunctional, resulting in insulin resistance—a hallmark of both type 2 diabetes and PCOS.

In addition to its role as a chemical chaperone, 4‐PBA has been documented to possess weak inhibitory activity against histone deacetylases (HDACs) at higher concentrations. HDAC inhibition can lead to an alteration in chromatin structure and, consequently, changes in gene expression. Such epigenetic modifications may contribute to the modulation of stress responses, inflammatory cytokine production, and metabolic regulatory pathways (Khan et al., 2017; Mimori et al., 2017). Thus, the overall mechanism of action of 4‐PBA is twofold: it directly enhances protein folding within the ER, thereby reducing ER stress and its downstream effects such as JNK-mediated serine phosphorylation of IRS-1; and it may also bring about beneficial alterations in gene expression through its HDAC inhibitory effect.

Moreover, several studies support that the alleviation of ER stress by 4‐PBA correlates with improvements in insulin sensitivity. For example, in experimental models of obesity and type 2 diabetes, administration of 4‐PBA has been associated with a decrease in ER stress markers and a concomitant improvement in insulin receptor signaling, reflected in enhanced Akt activation (Liong & Lappas, 2015). The integration of these effects underlines the potential for 4‐PBA to counteract insulin resistance by restoring the functionality of the insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt pathway, a development that is particularly promising when considering tissues such as ovarian granulosa cells, where insulin signaling plays a critical role in cellular metabolism and folliculogenesis.

Expected Effect in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a multifactorial endocrine disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and insulin resistance. Among the myriad cellular disturbances observed in PCOS, chronic ER stress within ovarian granulosa cells emerges as a significant contributor to the impaired insulin signaling that underlies many of its metabolic complications. Granulosa cells are essential for the development and maturation of ovarian follicles, and their proper function depends on balanced insulin receptor signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway. However, in PCOS, persistent ER stress is believed to trigger a pathological cascade that includes the overactivation of PERK, phosphorylation of eIF2α, and subsequent induction of JNK activity (He & Moreau, 2019; Chen et al., 2023).

The anticipated mode of therapeutic action for 4‐PBA in the context of PCOS is predicated on its ability to act as a chemical chaperone in ovarian granulosa cells. Upon administration, 4‐PBA is expected to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and improve the folding of deficient or misfolded proteins. This improved protein homeostasis should lead to a reduction in the activation of UPR sensors—including PERK—and result in a decrease in the phosphorylation of eIF2α (He & Moreau, 2019). As a consequence of this dampening of ER stress, the activation of downstream stress kinases such as JNK is expected to be attenuated. Since active JNK is directly implicated in the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, its inhibition should theoretically reduce the inhibitory modifications on IRS-1, thereby allowing for the restoration of appropriate insulin signaling through the insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt pathway (Kolb et al., 2015; Khan et al., 2017).

In ovarian granulosa cells, the restoration of insulin signaling is not only crucial for glucose uptake but also for maintaining the hormonal environment favorable for follicular development. Insulin resistance in granulosa cells contributes to dysfunctional steroidogenesis, disturbed folliculogenesis, and ultimately impaired fertility. Preclinical findings from studies involving other insulin-resistant tissues have demonstrated that 4‐PBA can significantly improve insulin receptor signaling and enhance downstream Akt activation, which is pivotal for promoting glucose uptake and overall cellular energy balance (Liong & Lappas, 2015). Although the direct experimental evidence for these effects in granulosa cells is not yet extensive, the established mechanisms of 4‐PBA in reducing ER stress and mitigating JNK activation provide a strong biochemical rationale for its expected beneficial effects in the ovarian microenvironment.

Furthermore, by indirectly reducing IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, 4‐PBA may help shift the balance from a pro-inflammatory and stress-induced state towards one of improved metabolic homeostasis. This shift is especially relevant because the impaired insulin signaling observed in PCOS is a central driver of both the metabolic and reproductive disturbances in the syndrome. In addition to its chaperone activity, any secondary HDAC inhibitory effects of 4‐PBA may contribute to favorable changes in the expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism and inflammation, further enhancing its therapeutic potential in PCOS (Khan et al., 2017; Mimori et al., 2017).

Overall, the expected effect of 4‐PBA in PCOS would be a significant improvement in insulin receptor signaling within granulosa cells. This improvement would be achieved through the reduction of ER stress markers, decreased activation of the PERK/eIF2α/JNK signaling axis, and a lowering of inhibitory IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. Ultimately, this restored signaling pathway should lead to increased glucose uptake and improved metabolic and endocrine function in the ovary, potentially resulting in better folliculogenesis, reduced hyperandrogenism, and improved fertility in patients with PCOS (He & Moreau, 2019; Chen et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation
Integrating the historical data, the molecular mechanism of action, and the expected physiological effects, 4‐Phenylbutyric acid emerges as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. Several key strengths and considerations support this view:

1. Established Clinical Safety and Well‐Characterized ADME Profile:
4‐PBA has an extensive track record of clinical use in urea cycle disorders and has been administered safely to a diverse patient population for years. Its detailed ADME profile and regulatory approval by the FDA significantly reduce the hurdles associated with repurposing a drug for a new indication. This safety record is especially important given that PCOS is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, meaning that any candidate must exhibit minimal toxicity and high tolerability (He & Moreau, 2019; Kolb et al., 2015).

2. Robust Mechanistic Rationale—Targeting ER Stress and Insulin Resistance:
The molecular underpinnings of PCOS involve a complex interplay between insulin resistance, chronic cellular stress, and disrupted hormonal signaling. The mechanism of action of 4‐PBA addresses these fundamental issues by serving as a chemical chaperone that improves protein folding within the ER. By doing so, it reduces the misfolded protein load, minimizes the activation of UPR sensors such as PERK, and subsequently decreases the phosphorylation of eIF2α. This cascade ultimately results in reduced activation of JNK, lowering the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and thereby restoring normal signaling through the insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt pathway. Given that impaired insulin signaling is a central feature of the metabolic disturbances in PCOS, its restoration in ovarian granulosa cells is anticipated to bring about improvements not only in cellular glucose uptake but also in broader metabolic regulation and follicular development (He & Moreau, 2019; Kolb et al., 2015; Khan et al., 2017).

3. Preclinical Evidence Supporting Insulin Sensitivity Improvement:
Studies in animal models of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic syndromes have demonstrated that 4‐PBA can alleviate ER stress and promote insulin sensitivity in tissues vital to glucose metabolism, including the liver, adipose tissue, and pancreatic β‐cells (Liong & Lappas, 2015; Khan et al., 2017). Although direct evidence in ovarian granulosa cells remains limited, the similar underpinning mechanisms across various insulin-sensitive tissues support the plausibility that granulosa cells in PCOS would benefit in a similar manner.

4. Potential for Epigenetic and Long-Term Beneficial Effects:
At higher concentrations, the HDAC inhibitory activity of 4‐PBA may provide supplementary benefits by altering gene expression patterns in ways that combat inflammation and sustain metabolic homeostasis. This epigenetic modulation could further enhance the long-term efficacy of the treatment by favorably adjusting the cellular stress response over time (Khan et al., 2017; Mimori et al., 2017).

5. Therapeutic Gap in Current PCOS Treatments:
Current treatment modalities for PCOS have significant limitations, particularly in addressing the fundamental metabolic dysfunction underlying insulin resistance. While agents such as metformin help improve insulin sensitivity, their effects on ER stress and direct cellular stress responses in ovarian tissue are not fully optimal. 4‐PBA, by directly targeting ER stress, offers a novel therapeutic angle that could complement or enhance existing treatments, potentially leading to more comprehensive management of both the metabolic and reproductive aspects of PCOS (Chen et al., 2023).

Despite these strengths, some challenges and considerations must be acknowledged:

a. Limited Direct Evidence in Ovarian Granulosa Cells and PCOS Models:
While there is robust preclinical evidence in other metabolic tissues, direct studies evaluating the effects of 4‐PBA in ovarian granulosa cells or in animal models of PCOS are currently sparse. A search of clinical trial databases confirms that 4‐PBA has not yet been directly studied in PCOS patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Future research must prioritize investigations that specifically examine the compound’s impact on ovarian cellular biology and insulin signaling within the reproductive context (Chen et al., 2023).

b. Optimal Dosage and Formulation Challenges:
Even though 4‐PBA is clinically approved and its ADME profile is well characterized, there are known issues related to its dosing form. Because the compound is commonly administered in its sodium salt form, there can be concerns related to sodium load, which may be problematic in patients with cardiovascular or renal concerns. Furthermore, adverse effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances have been noted in other clinical uses. Tailoring the dosing regimen for PCOS—possibly through modified-release formulations or lower dosing strategies—will be essential to maximize therapeutic benefit while minimizing side effects (He & Moreau, 2019).

c. Multifactorial Nature of PCOS:
PCOS is a heterogeneous and multifaceted syndrome, involving not only insulin resistance but also hyperandrogenism, ovarian dysfunction, and chronic low-grade inflammation. As such, while restoring insulin signaling in granulosa cells could significantly improve metabolic and follicular outcomes, it may not address other pathogenic aspects of PCOS on its own. Combination therapies that integrate 4‐PBA with other agents targeting androgen excess or inflammation might be required to achieve optimal clinical benefits.

d. Secondary Mechanisms and Off-Target Effects:
The secondary HDAC inhibitory effect of 4‐PBA, though potentially beneficial from an epigenetic standpoint, may also lead to off-target modulation of gene expression that could have unforeseen consequences. It will be important to delineate the dose at which chemical chaperoning predominates over HDAC inhibition, or whether both mechanisms can be synergistically harnessed without adverse effects.

e. Need for Rigorous Preclinical and Clinical Evaluation:
Before proceeding to large-scale clinical trials, further preclinical studies employing in vitro models of ovarian granulosa cells derived from PCOS patients or appropriate animal models of PCOS will be needed. These studies should rigorously assess if 4‐PBA can indeed lower PERK/eIF2α-mediated JNK activation and reduce IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, thereby restoring insulin receptor signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Such experimental validation will be crucial to substantiate the hypothesis that improvement in cellular glucose uptake within the ovarian microenvironment translates into beneficial clinical outcomes for PCOS (He & Moreau, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Conclusion
In summary, the repurposing of 4‐Phenylbutyric acid (4‐PBA) for the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is a compelling therapeutic proposition underpinned by strong mechanistic rationale and expansive preclinical evidence in related metabolic disorders. Its origin as a synthetic derivative of butyric acid, with enhanced pharmacokinetics and dual action as a chemical chaperone and HDAC inhibitor, has already been leveraged effectively in the treatment of urea cycle disorders and explored in models of obesity, diabetes, and neurodegeneration (He & Moreau, 2019; Kolb et al., 2015).

The key pathological process targeted by 4‐PBA in this repurposing strategy is ER stress—a significant contributor to insulin resistance via the activation of the PERK/eIF2α/JNK signaling cascade and the subsequent inhibitory serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. By improving protein folding within the ER and dampening the UPR, 4‐PBA is expected to restore proper insulin signaling via the insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt pathway in ovarian granulosa cells, which is critical for normal follicular development and metabolic homeostasis in PCOS (He & Moreau, 2019; Kolb et al., 2015; Khan et al., 2017).

While the extensive clinical safety data associated with 4‐PBA in other indications is highly encouraging, several challenges remain. Chief among these is the need for direct experimental verification of the compound’s effects in granulosa cells and PCOS models. The absence of any registered clinical trials for 4‐PBA specifically targeting PCOS underscores the novelty of this approach and the necessity for further preclinical work (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, questions regarding optimal dosing strategies, potential sodium load issues, and off-target effects via HDAC inhibition must be carefully addressed in future studies.

Nevertheless, the overall evaluation of 4‐PBA as a candidate for PCOS is decidedly positive. Its established ability to reduce ER stress and improve insulin sensitivity in numerous metabolic tissues—coupled with a well-understood mechanism of action—provides a robust foundation for its repurposing. As our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of PCOS continues to evolve, particularly the role of ER stress in ovarian dysfunction and insulin resistance, 4‐PBA represents a novel and innovative therapeutic avenue that could complement existing treatments or be integrated into combination therapies for a more effective management of this complex syndrome.

Moving forward, it will be critical to design comprehensive in vitro studies using human granulosa cells, as well as in vivo experiments in relevant animal models of PCOS, to confirm that 4‐PBA can indeed reduce ER stress markers such as phosphorylated eIF2α and CHOP, lower JNK activation, and consequently diminish IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. Such studies should also investigate any epigenetic changes associated with HDAC inhibition to ensure that the net effect is beneficial for cellular metabolism and reproductive function (Chen et al., 2023).

Given the mechanistic insights provided by various studies – including those detailing the modulation of ER stress-induced pathways in metabolic and neuronal contexts (Liong & Lappas, 2015; Khan et al., 2017; Mimori et al., 2017) – there is strong justification for further exploration of 4‐PBA in PCOS. In the long run, if preclinical studies yield promising results, clinical trials designed specifically to assess 4‐PBA's impact on ovarian insulin signaling and metabolic parameters in PCOS patients could pave the way for its adoption as a novel therapeutic approach. Such trials would ideally include detailed biomarker analysis of ER stress and insulin signaling components in ovarian tissue, alongside assessments of clinical outcomes such as improvements in menstrual regularity, reductions in androgen levels, and enhanced fertility.

In conclusion, 4‐Phenylbutyric acid is an especially attractive candidate for repurposing in the treatment of PCOS due to its multifaceted mechanism of action centered on the alleviation of ER stress. Its robust safety profile, established clinical use, and compelling preclinical evidence supporting improvements in insulin sensitivity collectively argue in favor of its further investigation. Although significant challenges remain—including the need for direct evidence in ovarian cells and optimal dosing regimens—the therapeutic promise of 4‐PBA in addressing the core metabolic and reproductive disturbances in PCOS is considerable. With strategic preclinical research and eventual clinical validation, 4‐PBA could well become part of a new generation of targeted therapies aimed at restoring normal cellular function in PCOS, ultimately offering improved outcomes for affected women (He & Moreau, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chen et al., 2023).

Roflumilast (Novartis; PDE4 inhibitor),"Proposal for Roflumilast (Novartis; PDE4 inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Roflumilast is a small‐molecule, synthetic drug belonging to the phosphodiesterase‐4 (PDE4) inhibitor class. Originally developed for the treatment of chronic inflammatory airway diseases, its discovery and development focused on its potent and selective inhibition of PDE4 enzymes, thereby elevating intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Roflumilast was synthesized and optimized from early PDE4 inhibitors such as rolipram, with modifications that improved its pharmacokinetic profile and tolerated dosing schedules for once‐daily oral administration. As a member of the PDE4 inhibitor class, it has been used primarily in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – a condition marked by persistent inflammation and airflow limitation – by modulating the immune responses of inflammatory cells. Its chemical derivation and further optimization have resulted in a compound with robust safety data and predictable pharmacodynamics, which forms the basis for hypothesizing its potential repurposing in metabolic diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (Jensterle, Kocjan, & Janez, 2014; Hatzelmann et al., 2010).

Therapeutic History:
Clinically, roflumilast has an established history in treating inflammatory pulmonary diseases. It was approved for the management of severe COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations due to its anti-inflammatory properties along with modest bronchodilator effects. Its efficacy has been demonstrated by its ability to reduce proinflammatory cytokine levels, decrease the number of exacerbations, and improve overall lung function in this population (Jensterle et al., 2015; Mollmann et al., 2017). Although its primary indication to date has been for respiratory disease, experimental studies and pilot clinical trials in related metabolic conditions have produced evidence for improved insulin sensitivity and weight loss in obese and diabetic models (Mollmann et al., 2017; Muo et al., 2019). Importantly, preclinical investigations in rodent models of PCOS have suggested that combinatorial therapies using roflumilast with metformin can lead to greater weight loss and metabolic improvements compared with metformin monotherapy, though the data remains preliminary (Tohma et al., 2019). However, while roflumilast has been studied in obese and insulin‐resistant populations, to date there is no extensive clinical history of its sole use as a treatment for PCOS, and its direct effects on ovarian granulosa cells remain to be fully characterized (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2013).

Mechanism of Action:
Roflumilast exerts its pharmacological effects via robust and selective inhibition of the PDE4 family of enzymes, which are responsible for degrading cAMP. Under normal physiological conditions, cAMP functions as a key secondary messenger involved in modulating inflammation, immune cell activation, cellular metabolism, and gene transcription through the downstream activation of protein kinase A (PKA). By inhibiting PDE4, roflumilast leads to an accumulation of cAMP, resulting in activation of PKA and other cAMP-responsive pathways. This elevation of cAMP is known to induce de novo expression of anti-inflammatory mediators while simultaneously attenuating the activity of inflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) and stress-activated protein kinases like c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (Jensterle et al., 2014; Giembycz & Newton, 2014). In the context of PCOS, chronic low-grade inflammation is implicated in disrupting insulin receptor signaling. Inflammatory mediators, through NFκB and JNK, impair insulin receptor substrate functions and impede the downstream phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which is crucial for facilitating GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in metabolic tissues. Roflumilast’s ability to suppress these inflammatory cascades, by reducing NFκB and JNK activity via increased cAMP/PKA signaling, may thereby ameliorate insulin resistance (Sever et al., 2018; Xu, Zhang, & Xiao, 2021). Moreover, the mechanistic specificity of PDE4 inhibition in elevating cAMP has been documented in various tissues including immune cells and, potentially, ovarian granulosa cells; although direct mechanistic studies in these ovarian cells are less extensive, the general expression of PDE enzymes in ovarian tissue provides a biochemical rationale (Jensterle et al., 2014; Crocetti et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
Within the context of PCOS, the hypothesis is that chronic inflammation contributes to the impairment of insulin signaling in ovarian granulosa cells. In these cells, elevated inflammatory signaling via NFκB and JNK pathways can disrupt insulin receptor substrate functions, thereby reducing the efficacy of insulin-stimulated PI3K/Akt signaling. The ensuing defect in insulin signaling results in diminished translocation of GLUT4 transporters to the plasma membrane, leading to reduced glucose uptake and contributing to systemic insulin resistance—a hallmark of PCOS (Garruti et al., 2009; Tohma et al., 2019). By administering roflumilast, it is expected that PDE4 inhibition will elevate intracellular cAMP within granulosa cells, which in turn will activate PKA. PKA activation is anticipated to lead to a reduction in NFκB and JNK-mediated inflammatory signaling, alleviating their inhibitory effects on insulin receptor signaling. With these inflammatory brakes removed, the insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt pathway could be more responsive, resulting in increased GLUT4 translocation and an enhanced uptake of glucose by the cells (Jensterle et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2020). Evidence from rodent models, where the combination of roflumilast with metformin produced significant improvements in glucose homeostasis and weight loss, supports the notion that roflumilast-induced PDE4 inhibition may potentiate metabolic signaling in insulin-resistant states (Tohma et al., 2019; Mollmann et al., 2017). Furthermore, given that granulosa cells have been shown to express components of the cAMP signaling machinery and that cyclic nucleotide modulation plays a role in steroidogenesis and follicular function, the proposed effect in enhancing insulin signaling is mechanistically plausible (Jensterle et al., 2014; Crocetti et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Roflumilast presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in PCOS based on several lines of evidence. One significant strength of roflumilast is its well-established safety profile and robust pharmacokinetic data obtained from years of clinical use in COPD. Its mechanism—selective inhibition of PDE4 leading to elevated intracellular cAMP and subsequent modulation of inflammatory signaling cascades—is well characterized and has demonstrated efficacy in reducing proinflammatory cytokine production and improving insulin sensitivity in preclinical experiments (Jensterle et al., 2014; Mollmann et al., 2017). The specific hypothesis that roflumilast can elevate cAMP in PCOS granulosa cells and thereby activate PKA to reduce NFκB and JNK signaling, while simultaneously potentiating insulin receptor-mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway to enhance GLUT4 translocation, is mechanistically sound and supported by fundamental cellular biochemistry (Sever et al., 2018; Tohma et al., 2019). Additionally, while preclinical rodent studies and pilot clinical trials in obese or diabetic cohorts hint at metabolic benefits of PDE4 inhibition, direct evidence of efficacy in PCOS patients or in ovarian granulosa cells specifically is limited. Most published data focus on respiratory and systemic metabolic effects rather than reproductive endocrine endpoints, and thus it remains an open question whether the biochemical improvements observed systemically translate into restored ovarian insulin signaling and improved follicular function in PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2013, 2014). Additionally, while the anti-inflammatory effects via cAMP elevation are well demonstrated in immune cells and pulmonary tissues, the degree to which these mechanisms operate in ovarian granulosa cells needs further experimental validation (Jensterle et al., 2014; Lugnier, 2022). There is also the challenge of dosing and pharmacokinetic considerations when repurposing for a new indication; the effective concentration in ovarian tissue might differ from that achieved in the lung, and potential off-target effects in reproductive tissues have yet to be thoroughly explored (Tohma et al., 2019; Akel et al., 2024).

In summary, roflumilast’s potent anti-inflammatory action, mediated through PDE4 inhibition and subsequent cAMP elevation, coupled with preclinical data demonstrating improved insulin sensitivity, provides a solid rationale for its evaluation as a repurposed therapeutic candidate in PCOS. Its clinical safety and well‐characterized mechanism make it attractive for further investigation. However, before advancing to large-scale clinical trials in PCOS, additional targeted preclinical studies are needed to specifically evaluate its effects on ovarian granulosa cells, insulin receptor signaling, and follicular function in relevant animal models. Overall, roflumilast shows significant potential, but further research is required to confirm its therapeutic efficacy and to determine the optimal dosing regimen for combating the metabolic and inflammatory disturbances prevalent in PCOS (Jensterle et al., 2015; Mollmann et al., 2017; Xu, Zhang, & Xiao, 2021; Schudt, Hatzelmann, Beume, & Tenor, 2011).

Obeticholic acid (Intercept Pharmaceuticals; FXR agonist),"Proposal for Obeticholic acid (Intercept Pharmaceuticals; FXR agonist)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a semi‐synthetic bile acid derivative that was designed by modifying the structure of chenodeoxycholic acid in order to enhance its affinity and selectivity for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). As an FXR agonist, OCA belongs to a class of nuclear receptor agonists that regulate bile acid homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and glucose metabolism. Its synthesis involves chemical modifications that increase its potency by approximately 100‐fold relative to the natural FXR agonist chenodeoxycholic acid (Abenavoli et al., 2018). This compound is produced by Intercept Pharmaceuticals and is primarily used in the treatment of liver-related metabolic disorders such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). FXR agonists, as a general class, have been explored for their potential to modulate metabolic pathways that are disrupted in various metabolic diseases. This class of compounds has been extensively studied for its actions in the liver and intestines, where FXR activation leads to reduced bile acid synthesis, improved insulin sensitivity, and beneficial effects on cholesterol and lipid profiles (Abenavoli et al., 2018; Tong et al., 2025).

Therapeutic History:
Obeticholic acid has a substantial history in clinical development for metabolic liver disorders, particularly NASH and PBC. Clinical trials such as the FLINT trial have demonstrated that OCA can improve liver histology and fibrosis markers in patients with non-cirrhotic NASH, while additional studies have shown improvements in surrogate markers of insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles in diabetic patients with NAFLD (Abenavoli et al., 2018; Gan et al., 2023). In contrast to its extensive evaluation in hepatic diseases, searches of the clinical trials registry for conditions explicitly linking obeticholic acid with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) or ovarian insulin resistance—using the query “Obeticholic acid AND (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome OR PCOS OR ovarian insulin resistance)”—have returned zero clinical trials, indicating that this therapeutic candidate has not been directly examined in PCOS patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The extensive body of literature on FXR agonists remains focused on metabolic liver conditions; however, emerging preclinical and network pharmacology studies have started to explore the potential implications of bile acid signaling in extra-hepatic tissues, including the ovary. In studies using animal models and in silico analyses, bile acid-related pathways via FXR have been implicated in ovarian granulosa cell function and steroidogenesis, suggesting mechanistic hypotheses that may be translatable to PCOS pathophysiology (Takae et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
Obeticholic acid exerts its therapeutic actions predominantly through activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor that, upon activation, forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). This heterodimer binds to FXR response elements (FXRE) in the promoter regions of target genes, thereby regulating the transcription of genes involved in bile acid synthesis, lipid metabolism, and glucose homeostasis. One of the critical downstream targets of FXR activation is the small heterodimer partner (SHP), a transcriptional repressor that posts a negative feedback loop to inhibit CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis (Abenavoli et al., 2018; Tong et al., 2025). In addition to this classical pathway, FXR activation has been shown to modulate gluconeogenic and lipid regulatory genes including those involved in the synthesis and transport of lipids, such as PEPCK and sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs). FXR activation also affects inflammation by inhibiting nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling, which contributes to reduced inflammatory cytokine production. In metabolic models, FXR agonism with OCA has resulted in decreased intrahepatic lipid accumulation, improved insulin sensitivity via enhancement of the PI3K/Akt pathway, and reduced markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress likely secondary to decreased lipotoxicity (Abenavoli et al., 2018; Haczeyni et al., 2017; Tong et al., 2025).
At the molecular level, FXR activation appears to play a dual role. In hepatocytes, it controls pathways that reduce lipogenesis and stimulate fatty acid oxidation, while in adipose tissue, particularly in depot-specific fat such as periovarian adipose tissue, FXR activation has been associated with improved adipocyte morphology, reduced inflammatory infiltrates, and increased expression of thermogenic markers (Haczeyni et al., 2017; Tong et al., 2025).
Importantly, the expression of FXR in ovarian granulosa cells has been detected, although its functional role in these cells is less extensively characterized compared to liver and intestinal tissues. Studies have demonstrated that FXR in ovarian granulosa cells modulates genes related to steroidogenesis, such as aromatase (CYP19A1) and may interact with lipid binding proteins like FABP6. The intrinsic role of FXR signaling in granulosa cells suggests that FXR agonists like OCA might influence ovarian function by modulating intra-cellular lipid accumulation, inflammatory cytokine production, and insulin signaling pathways (Takae et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021). Additionally, network pharmacology analyses have predicted that modulation of FXR can influence key metabolic signaling cascades including PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and cAMP signaling routes that are central to both insulin sensitivity and cell survival, establishing a solid rationale for the therapeutic hypothesis (Tong et al., 2025).

Expected Effect:
The working hypothesis for employing obeticholic acid in PCOS is that activation of FXR in ovarian granulosa cells will favorably modulate the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. Specifically, the anticipated effects include upregulation of the small heterodimer partner (SHP) that serves as a key regulator of bile acid synthesis and lipid metabolism genes, as well as modulation of gluconeogenic genes such as PEPCK. By reducing intracellular lipid accumulation, OCA is expected to decrease lipotoxicity-driven endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress—a condition known to impair insulin receptor signaling. Consequently, the reduction in ER stress may lead to enhanced insulin receptor activity and improved PI3K/Akt signaling. This cascade of molecular events is hypothesized to increase glucose uptake in granulosa cells and may contribute to restoring normal cellular function and steroidogenesis, which are commonly compromised in PCOS (Abenavoli et al., 2018; Tong et al., 2025).
In support of this expected effect, recent studies have detected FXR expression in ovarian granulosa cells and suggested that its activation might regulate steroidogenic pathways via modulation of lipid metabolism and inflammatory signals (Takae et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021). Moreover, the biochemical processes linked to insulin signaling—chiefly the PI3K/Akt pathway—are critical for normal granulosa cell function and glucose uptake. Given that PCOS is characterized by an impaired insulin signaling cascade along with excessive lipid accumulation in the ovary, therapeutic modulation through FXR activation could yield multifaceted benefits by reducing both lipotoxicity and inflammatory stress while improving insulin sensitivity (Belani et al., 2018; Kong et al., 2017).
Furthermore, preclinical data from hepatic and adipose tissues demonstrate that OCA improves systemic insulin sensitivity, reduces hepatic steatosis, and modulates adipose tissue architecture, all of which are metabolic factors that could indirectly influence ovarian function. For example, the improvement in periovarian adipose tissue morphology, as seen in wild-type mice treated with OCA in dietary obesity models, may have parallel benefits for ovarian insulin sensitivity and steroidogenic function in PCOS patients (Haczeyni et al., 2017; Tong et al., 2025).
Consequently, in the assay proposed, one would expect that obeticholic acid treatment would lead to (1) a reduction in lipotoxicity markers and ER stress indicators in cultured granulosa cells, (2) modulation of key metabolic gene expression patterns such as increased SHP and reduced PEPCK transcription, and (3) an improvement in insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt signaling, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of Akt and enhanced GLUT4 translocation, ultimately leading to improved glucose uptake (Takae et al., 2019; Tong et al., 2025).

Overall Evaluation:
Obeticholic acid represents a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, particularly given the strong mechanistic rationale derived from its known effects on FXR activation. The compound benefits from an extensive safety and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile established in clinical trials for liver diseases such as NASH and PBC (Abenavoli et al., 2018; Gan et al., 2023). Its well-characterized mechanism of action—namely, the activation of FXR leading to modulation of bile acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism pathways—suggests a possible extension of these benefits to ovarian tissue. In PCOS, where insulin resistance, lipotoxicity, and inflammation contribute to ovarian dysfunction, the ability of OCA to reduce intracellular lipid accumulation and inflammatory signaling while enhancing insulin sensitivity through the PI3K/Akt pathway is highly appealing (Belani et al., 2018; Tong et al., 2025).

One clear strength of this candidate is its established clinical safety record and the comprehensive mechanistic understanding that underpins its effects in metabolic liver diseases. This provides confidence that OCA could be rapidly advanced into phase II clinical investigations for PCOS if initial preclinical models in ovarian granulosa cells show promising results. The cross-talk between hepatic metabolic regulation and ovarian function has become an emerging area of research, and targeting FXR in granulosa cells represents a novel angle that could address the metabolic component of PCOS beyond current treatments that predominantly focus on hormonal modulation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rađenović et al., 2022).

However, several potential weaknesses and challenges must be acknowledged. First, despite the robust preclinical data in liver and adipose tissues, direct evidence for OCA’s efficacy in ovarian tissue, particularly in the modulation of granulosa cell function and insulin signaling, remains limited. The current literature contains no dedicated clinical trials or biochemical studies specifically evaluating OCA in PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, the ovarian microenvironment differs substantially from hepatic tissues, and the expression levels and downstream targets of FXR in granulosa cells are not fully delineated. There is a need for more targeted in vitro and in vivo studies to establish the dose-response relationships, tissue-specific gene regulation, and long-term effects of FXR activation in the ovary (Takae et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021).

Another consideration is that the metabolic benefits observed with OCA in liver disease models may not extrapolate completely to PCOS, given the complex etiology of PCOS which involves hyperandrogenism, reproductive dysfunction, and systemic insulin resistance. The specific impact of FXR activation on granulosa cell steroidogenesis and follicular development requires further clarification, as alterations in these pathways could potentially have unintended effects on reproductive hormone balance (Tong et al., 2025; Belani et al., 2018). Additionally, the dose required to achieve effective concentrations in the ovary without eliciting adverse effects remains unknown, and the possibility exists that systemic FXR activation may produce off-target metabolic effects that could complicate the clinical picture in PCOS patients.

Moreover, while the hypothesis that FXR activation will reduce ER stress and lipotoxicity in granulosa cells is supported by findings in hepatic cells, the cellular context of the ovary presents unique challenges. Granulosa cells in the ovarian follicle are highly differentiated and perform complex endocrine functions, and modulation of any nuclear receptor in these cells must be carefully balanced to avoid disrupting normal steroidogenesis. The risk of inadvertently exacerbating hormonal imbalances in PCOS is a consideration that will require careful experimental and clinical investigation (Takae et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021).

Overall, obeticholic acid is a compelling candidate for repurposing in PCOS based on its well-established mechanism of action and the theoretical benefits of FXR activation in modulating lipid and glucose metabolism. Its potential to reduce lipotoxicity-driven ER stress and enhance insulin receptor signaling in ovarian granulosa cells aligns closely with the unmet needs in PCOS therapy. However, the critical gaps in direct ovarian-specific data necessitate further preclinical studies that characterize FXR expression and function in granulosa cells, define the gene expression changes induced by OCA in ovarian tissue, and establish proof of concept in relevant animal models of PCOS. The strengths of OCA lie in its known safety profile and the detailed mechanistic framework that supports its metabolic benefits, while its weaknesses include the current absence of direct clinical or biochemical evidence in the PCOS setting and uncertainty regarding ovarian tissue specificity. In conclusion, although promising, obeticholic acid will require a robust investigative program to validate its efficacy and safety in PCOS before it can be considered a viable therapeutic option for repurposing. Continued collaboration between reproductive biologists, endocrinologists, and metabolic researchers is essential to address these gaps and fully assess whether FXR activation by obeticholic acid can restore normal metabolic and reproductive function in PCOS patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Abenavoli et al., 2018; Tong et al., 2025; Takae et al., 2019).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate

Pterostilbene is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound belonging to the stilbene family and is structurally related to resveratrol. Discovered in plant materials such as blueberries, grapes, and the heartwood of Pterocarpus marsupium, pterostilbene is characterized by two methoxy groups replacing two hydroxyl groups on the stilbene backbone. This chemical modification increases its lipophilicity and oral bioavailability while also conferring enhanced metabolic stability versus resveratrol (Kim et al., 2020; Li et al., 2018). As a member of the natural stilbene group, pterostilbene has historically been recognized for its antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, neuroprotective, and metabolic regulatory properties. Traditionally, such naturally derived compounds have found use as nutraceuticals and dietary supplements, helping to ameliorate oxidative stress and modulate inflammatory cascades in a variety of chronic, metabolic, and age‐related conditions. The improved bioavailability of pterostilbene is a critical advantage; thanks to its enhanced absorption and capacity to cross cell membranes, it has sparked interest as a potential agent to target metabolic disturbances related to insulin resistance—a pathology common to diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and PCOS (Kim et al., 2020).

The therapeutic promise of pterostilbene, when viewed in the context of PCOS, lies in its ability to modulate key pathways involved in energy homeostasis and inflammation. The compound’s demonstrated capacity to affect both SIRT1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) positions it as a candidate to address the multifactorial nature of PCOS pathophysiology. In summary, pterostilbene is a natural, bioavailable stilbene with a robust history as a nutraceutical, possessing multi-targeted biochemical activities that could potentially be harnessed to correct derangements in insulin signaling and chronic inflammation in PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov).

─────────────────────────────────────────────
Therapeutic History

Pterostilbene’s preclinical history is replete with data documenting its pharmacological impact on metabolic health. In animal studies, pterostilbene has repeatedly been shown to reduce fasting blood glucose levels, improve lipid profiles, and lower markers of inflammation in models of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. For instance, rodent experiments have demonstrated that pterostilbene treatment results in significant improvements in hyperglycemia, decreased insulin resistance, decreased adiposity, and overall metabolic enhancements, thereby positioning it as a promising candidate for metabolic diseases (Riche et al., 2014; McCormack & McFadden, 2013).

Clinical investigations in subjects with hyperlipidemia or metabolic syndrome have also been performed. In these studies, doses ranging up to 250 mg per day have been administered; pterostilbene was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile, although some reports noted modest elevations in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol with monotherapy (Riche et al., 2014). Despite extensive study in the context of diabetes and cardiovascular risk, the direct clinical evaluation of pterostilbene for treating PCOS remains limited. A focused search on ClinicalTrials.gov using terms that include PCOS, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, SIRT1, and AMPK evidences that there is only one trial addressing these overlapping issues, reflecting a scarcity of direct clinical data in the PCOS population (ClinicalTrials.gov). However, considering that resveratrol—a close structural and functional analog—has been evaluated with promising outcomes in models of PCOS, there is a strong rationale to support further investigation of pterostilbene in this domain (McCormack & McFadden, 2013; Riche et al., 2014).

Beyond its metabolic benefits, pterostilbene has also been explored in the context of inflammation, where its use as a dietary supplement has been proposed for its potential protective effects against oxidative and inflammatory stress in multiple pathologies. Such a therapeutic history, although not explicitly detailing PCOS outcomes, underpins the candidate’s potential to counteract the low‐grade inflammatory state that is frequently observed in PCOS patients (ClinicalTrials.gov).

─────────────────────────────────────────────
Mechanism of Action

At the molecular level, pterostilbene exhibits several interrelated mechanisms that are relevant to the pathogenesis of PCOS. A central mechanism is the activation of SIRT1—a NAD⁺-dependent deacetylase well known for its role in regulating mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and inflammatory pathways. Activation of SIRT1 leads to the deacetylation and modulation of various transcription factors, resulting in enhanced antioxidant defenses and the downregulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression mediated by the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) pathway (Hudson, 2010). SIRT1 is broadly expressed in insulin-sensitive tissues, including the ovary, and its activation has been linked to improvements in insulin sensitivity—a key concern in PCOS.

Pterostilbene also robustly activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). As an important cellular energy sensor, AMPK becomes activated under conditions of low cellular energy, where its phosphorylation leads to the stimulation of catabolic pathways that generate ATP and the inhibition of anabolic processes. When activated, AMPK increases fatty acid oxidation, reduces lipogenesis, and importantly, enhances the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane via downstream signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway (Peng et al., 2024). In conditions of insulin resistance, such as in PCOS, chronic inflammation and elevated stress kinase activities (for example, NFκB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, JNK) lead to abnormal serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). This post-translational modification of IRS-1 is inhibitory and blunts insulin signal transduction. Evidence suggests that pterostilbene can reduce such deleterious serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, thereby restoring more effective insulin signaling and improving glucose uptake through the PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway (Peng et al., 2024; Shazmeen et al., 2021).

Further, pterostilbene exhibits potent anti-inflammatory effects. It has been shown to attenuate inflammatory responses by suppressing NFκB and JNK signaling pathways. The reduction of these signaling cascades leads to decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). This anti-inflammatory profile is particularly important in PCOS, wherein chronic low-grade inflammation contributes to both metabolic dysfunction and impaired ovarian function (Hudson, 2010; Shazmeen et al., 2021).

Additionally, pterostilbene may influence nuclear receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), further contributing to favorable lipid metabolism and reduction of ectopic fat deposition. Though the direct interactions with PPARα in the context of PCOS have not yet been fully delineated, this ancillary pathway is aligned with improvements in overall metabolic health and reductions in adiposity that have been observed in other metabolic models (Riche et al., 2014).

Collectively, the molecular actions of pterostilbene can be summarized as follows:
 • Activation of SIRT1 improves mitochondrial function, enhances antioxidant defenses, and downregulates NFκB-mediated inflammatory gene transcription (Hudson, 2010).
 • Stimulation of AMPK via increased phosphorylation leads to enhanced glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation via the PI3K/Akt–GLUT4 signaling cascade (Peng et al., 2024).
 • Reduction of aberrant IRS-1 serine phosphorylation restores normal insulin receptor signaling, thereby allowing efficient transduction of PI3K/Akt signals needed for GLUT4 translocation (Peng et al., 2024; Shazmeen et al., 2021).
 • Suppression of inflammatory pathways via inhibition of NFκB and JNK results in lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Hudson, 2010; Shazmeen et al., 2021).

These interwoven mechanisms are particularly relevant for PCOS since both insulin resistance and chronic inflammatory signaling have been implicated in impaired ovarian function, disrupted folliculogenesis, and metabolic disturbances in affected patients (Nagarajan et al., 2022).

─────────────────────────────────────────────
Expected Effect

Based on the integrated molecular actions described above, the hypothesis is that pterostilbene treatment in PCOS—specifically targeting ovarian granulosa cells—will yield several beneficial effects. First, activation of the SIRT1 pathway by pterostilbene is anticipated to suppress the NFκB and JNK inflammatory cascades. In PCOS, chronic low-grade inflammation contributes to cellular dysfunction and aberrant insulin signaling, so reducing these signals should decrease the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Hudson, 2010; Shazmeen et al., 2021).

Second, by stimulating AMPK phosphorylation, pterostilbene is expected to shift cellular metabolism toward improved energy balance. This shift will enhance insulin sensitivity by promoting the anabolic actions required for glucose uptake. Specifically, activation of the AMPK/PI3K/Akt axis should lead to increased translocation of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, thus optimizing glucose uptake into granulosa cells. This is particularly relevant given that granulosa cells express key components of the insulin signaling cascade—IRS-1, PI3K, Akt, and GLUT4—which are essential for proper cellular energy handling and steroidogenesis (Peng et al., 2024; Nagarajan et al., 2022).

A further expected effect is the reduction of inhibitory IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. In PCOS, chronic activation of inflammatory pathways results in increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which impairs its ability to propagate downstream insulin signaling. By decreasing this inhibitory modification, pterostilbene should restore a more normal pattern of insulin receptor activity, thereby bolstering the PI3K/Akt signal and the associated GLUT4 translocation required for effective glucose uptake (Peng et al., 2024; Shazmeen et al., 2021).

Moreover, improvements in insulin sensitivity and decreased inflammatory signaling are anticipated to lead to broader metabolic benefits. Enhanced insulin signaling in ovarian tissue may favorably alter the hormonal milieu by reducing compensatory hyperinsulinemia, which is known to exacerbate hyperandrogenemia—a central feature in the reproductive dysfunction observed in PCOS. While direct in vitro data in granulosa cells remain limited, the presence of the necessary molecular machinery (i.e., SIRT1, AMPK, IRS-1, PI3K/Akt components, and GLUT4) in these cells supports the plausibility that pterostilbene can exert these beneficial effects within the ovarian microenvironment (Nagarajan et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2024).

Additionally, some studies suggest that pterostilbene may also modulate the expression or activity of nuclear receptors such as PPARα, thereby contributing to improved systemic lipid metabolism. Although this action is relevant more broadly to metabolic syndrome and is not exclusively linked to ovarian function, the improvement in lipid profiles could further abate the metabolic stress imposed on ovarian tissues (Riche et al., 2014).

In summary, the expected effects when pterostilbene is applied in an experimental PCOS setting would include:
 – Increased activation (phosphorylation) of both SIRT1 and AMPK, leading to enhanced energy sensing.
 – Suppressed NFκB and JNK activity with consequent reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels.
 – Reduced serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, translating to improved insulin receptor signaling.
 – Enhanced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, culminating in increased GLUT4 translocation and augmented glucose uptake.
These molecular changes should help correct both the metabolic and inflammatory imbalances that contribute to ovarian dysfunction in PCOS (Peng et al., 2024; Shazmeen et al., 2021).

─────────────────────────────────────────────
Overall Evaluation

A thorough review of the available literature indicates that pterostilbene is a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of PCOS, particularly because of its dual action on inflammation and insulin resistance. One of the key strengths of pterostilbene lies in its favorable pharmacokinetic profile compared to resveratrol: its methoxylated structure offers superior oral bioavailability and metabolic stability, meaning that lower doses may achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations with minimal side effects (Kim et al., 2020).

Mechanistically, pterostilbene addresses two core pathological components of PCOS. First, its activation of SIRT1 supports robust antioxidant defenses and dampens inflammatory responses mediated by NFκB and JNK. Reduction of these inflammatory signals is critical, given that chronic low-grade inflammation is a contributor to disrupted ovarian function and systemic insulin resistance (Hudson, 2010; Shazmeen et al., 2021). Second, by stimulating AMPK, pterostilbene promotes improved glucose metabolism via the PI3K/Akt-GLUT4 pathway. This mechanism is particularly relevant to rebalancing the insulin signaling cascade in granulosa cells, which is often impaired by excessive serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in PCOS (Peng et al., 2024).

From a clinical perspective, although direct evidence for pterostilbene use in PCOS remains scarce—as highlighted by the limited number of clinical trials specifically addressing PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov)—its demonstrated efficacy in models of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular risk support its potential repurposing. Preclinical data in animal models have consistently shown improvements in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory markers after pterostilbene administration (Riche et al., 2014; McCormack & McFadden, 2013).

A significant limitation, however, is the paucity of research addressing direct effects on ovarian tissue, particularly granulosa cells, in PCOS. Although several lines of evidence confirm the expression of insulin signaling components (such as IRS-1, PI3K, Akt, and GLUT4) in granulosa cells, and data from analogous studies using resveratrol and other polyphenols suggest beneficial effects, dedicated studies with pterostilbene in an ovarian context are urgently needed (Nagarajan et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2024). It is essential to determine whether the systemic metabolic improvements observed in preclinical models translate into measurable enhancements in ovarian function, steroidogenesis, and folliculogenesis.

Furthermore, the interplay between metabolic and reproductive disturbances in PCOS is complex. While pterostilbene may serve as an adjunct therapy aimed at correcting the metabolic underpinnings, it is unlikely to be sufficient as a stand-alone treatment for full correction of PCOS pathology. For many patients, a combination therapy that also addresses hyperandrogenism and the endocrine dysregulation characteristic of PCOS may be necessary (ClinicalTrials.gov; Riche et al., 2014).

Another consideration is the dosage optimization and formulation. Although existing clinical studies in hyperlipidemic and diabetic cohorts indicate acceptable safety profiles at doses up to 250 mg daily, the effective dose for achieving therapeutic ovarian effects in PCOS has not been ascertained. Detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations in the target population will be crucial, particularly considering potential interactions with standard hormonal therapies used in PCOS management (Riche et al., 2014).

More broadly, the multifactorial nature of PCOS—encompassing genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors—implies that the success of any single agent will depend on its integration within a multifaceted treatment strategy. Pterostilbene’s safety, bioavailability, and dual mechanistic profile (i.e., anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties) make it a desirable candidate for use either as a nutraceutical supplement or in combination with other therapies aimed at restoring metabolic and endocrine balance (ClinicalTrials.gov).

In conclusion, the overall evaluation of pterostilbene as a therapeutic candidate for PCOS is highly encouraging. Its potent activation of SIRT1 and AMPK, the resulting downregulation of inflammatory mediators (NFκB and JNK), the normalization of IRS-1 phosphorylation, and the subsequent enhancement of PI3K/Akt-dependent GLUT4 translocation collectively provide a strong mechanistic basis for its use. Although direct clinical evidence in PCOS remains limited, the existing preclinical data and related clinical findings in metabolic disorders underscore the potential of pterostilbene to ameliorate both the metabolic and reproductive aberrations associated with PCOS (Hudson, 2010; Peng et al., 2024; Shazmeen et al., 2021; Riche et al., 2014).

Key strengths of pterostilbene include its superior bioavailability, established anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects, and a multifaceted mechanism that directly targets pathways known to be dysregulated in PCOS. Weaknesses include the current lack of direct ovarian or granulosa cell-specific studies, uncertain optimal dosing regimens for PCOS therapy, and the need to evaluate its interactions with existing hormonal treatments for PCOS.

Given these considerations, pterostilbene represents a promising candidate that warrants further investigation in targeted in vitro ovarian studies and subsequent clinical trials in PCOS populations. Its integration as an adjunct or complementary therapy could potentially address key components of PCOS—namely, insulin resistance and chronic inflammation—thus offering new avenues for treatment in this multifactorial disease (ClinicalTrials.gov; Kim et al., 2020; Hudson, 2010).

─────────────────────────────────────────────
Final Remarks

In summary, pterostilbene’s profile as a natural polyphenol with robust bioavailability, combined with its ability to activate critical metabolic regulators like SIRT1 and AMPK, provides a strong scientific foundation for its repurposing in PCOS. Its mechanistic actions—ranging from improved insulin receptor signaling through reduced IRS-1 serine phosphorylation to enhanced GLUT4 translocation via the PI3K/Akt cascade—address fundamental aspects of both the metabolic and inflammatory disturbances present in PCOS. Although additional targeted studies are necessary to clarify its effects in ovarian granulosa cells and to optimize therapeutic dosing, the current body of evidence supports the further development of pterostilbene as a novel, adjunctive strategy for managing the complex endocrine and metabolic derangements inherent in PCOS (Peng et al., 2024; Shazmeen et al., 2021; Riche et al., 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov; Nagarajan et al., 2022).

Overall, with collaborative research efforts bridging basic science and clinical validation, pterostilbene could emerge as an effective component of integrated treatment regimens for PCOS, offering new hope for patients facing both metabolic and reproductive challenges.

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of MK-4007 as a potential therapeutic candidate for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).","Proposal for MK-4007 (MedKoo Biosciences catalog #345998)

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of MK-4007 as a potential therapeutic candidate for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MK-4007 is a small molecule inhibitor specifically targeting protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). This compound belongs to the class of PTP1B inhibitors, which were developed using rational medicinal chemistry approaches to overcome the challenges associated with targeting the highly conserved and polar active site of PTP1B. Historically, early PTP1B inhibitors were designed as phosphotyrosine mimetics, using acidic functional groups to occupy the catalytic pocket; however, these compounds often suffered from low cell permeability and poor pharmacokinetics. To resolve these issues, drug discovery efforts have shifted towards compounds that target both the active site and allosteric pockets outside the catalytic domain, as this strategy has led to improved selectivity and oral bioavailability. MK-4007 is described as a potent competitive inhibitor that has been optimized for cell permeability and oral bioavailability, with demonstrable preclinical efficacy in diabetic rodent models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Zhang & Zhang, 2007; Maccari & Ottanà, 2023). Its design is consistent with other successful examples from the class—including compounds like trodusquemine—where structural modifications have enabled selective inhibition of PTP1B without severely compromising the druglike properties required for in vivo activity (Zhang & Zhang, 2007; Maccari & Ottanà, 2023).

Therapeutic History:
PTP1B inhibitors as a drug class have primarily been explored for the treatment of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that inhibition or genetic deletion of PTP1B leads to enhanced insulin signaling, improved glucose homeostasis, and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Mouse models lacking PTP1B exhibit enhanced insulin sensitivity, increased energy expenditure, and resistance to weight gain, which has provided strong proof-of-concept for the therapeutic modulation of this enzyme (Zhang & Zhang, 2007; Maccari & Ottanà, 2023). Several small molecule inhibitors, as well as antisense oligonucleotides targeting PTP1B, have reached early clinical trials with a focus on metabolic endpoints; although none have yet received regulatory approval, the safety and translational feasibility have been supported by extensive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies in diabetic rodent models (Boonloh et al., 2020; Delibegović et al., 2024).

In terms of repurposing for PCOS, the rationale stems from the established link between insulin resistance and PCOS pathogenesis. While the direct clinical usage of PTP1B inhibitors is predominantly oriented toward diabetes and obesity, there is a considerable body of literature suggesting that disrupted insulin signaling in ovarian granulosa cells contributes to the metabolic and reproductive dysfunction seen in PCOS (Diamanti-Kandarakis & Dunaif, 2012; Joharatnam, 2012). Notably, data from Open Targets indicate a modest association of the PTPN1 gene (encoding PTP1B) with PCOS; however, preclinical insights suggest that even a limited alteration in PTP1B activity in ovarian tissue could have a significant impact on insulin receptor (IR) signaling (Ochoa et al., 2023; Diamanti-Kandarakis & Dunaif, 2012). Therefore, the therapeutic history of PTP1B inhibitors in metabolic diseases provides a promising background for their potential repurposing in PCOS, despite there being no direct prior clinical studies of MK-4007 in PCOS patients.

Mechanism of Action:
The central role of PTP1B in insulin signaling underpins the rationale for using MK-4007 in conditions of insulin resistance. Under normal physiological conditions, insulin binds its receptor (a heterotetramer consisting of two extracellular α-subunits and two transmembrane β-subunits with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity), leading to autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on the β-subunit. This autophosphorylation event is critical for the subsequent recruitment and phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1, IRS-2, etc.). The phosphorylated IRS proteins then serve as docking sites for PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), which activates the Akt/PKB signaling cascade, culminating in the translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface and thereby promoting glucose uptake into insulin-sensitive tissues (Diamanti-Kandarakis & Dunaif, 2012; Joharatnam, 2012).

PTP1B acts as a basal negative regulator by dephosphorylating the activated insulin receptor as well as key downstream substrates, essentially acting as a “brake” on the insulin signal transduction pathway. By removing phosphate groups, PTP1B reduces the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and thereby impairs GLUT4 translocation – a defect that is a hallmark of insulin resistance in many tissues. MK-4007, by inhibiting the catalytic activity of PTP1B, would prevent this dephosphorylation and thereby enhance or prolong the phosphorylated, active state of the insulin receptor and IRS proteins (Zhang & Zhang, 2007; Maccari & Ottanà, 2023).

More specifically, MK-4007 is designed to act as a competitive inhibitor, binding to the active site of PTP1B and occluding the access of the natural phosphotyrosine substrates. In doing so, it preserves the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the insulin receptor and IRS proteins. The subsequent activation of the PI3K/Akt cascade is expected to result in higher levels of Akt phosphorylation, thereby boosting downstream signaling that leads to increased translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. This is particularly relevant for ovarian granulosa cells, where impaired insulin signaling has been implicated in abnormal follicular development and steroidogenesis commonly observed in PCOS (Joharatnam, 2012; Diamanti-Kandarakis & Dunaif, 2012).

Moreover, the compound’s reported optimization for cell permeability and oral bioavailability suggests that MK-4007 can effectively enter target cells such as granulosa cells and exert its inhibitory action on intracellular PTP1B. The preclinical efficacy in diabetic rodent models further substantiates its potency in enhancing insulin signaling in vivo, which is promising for its use in conditions characterized by insulin resistance (Zhang et al., 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis behind employing MK-4007 in PCOS is that by inhibiting PTP1B, it will lead to enhanced insulin receptor phosphorylation in ovarian granulosa cells. This molecular action should, in turn, lead to an augmented activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway—a critical signaling axis for both metabolic regulation and cell survival. In granulosa cells affected by the insulin-resistant state often present in PCOS, this enhanced signaling is expected to promote GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane, thereby increasing glucose uptake and correcting metabolic defects (Diamanti-Kandarakis & Dunaif, 2012; Joharatnam, 2012).

There is supporting evidence from related literature that shows PTP1B inhibition improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, including those in animal models of diabetes and obesity (Zhang & Zhang, 2007; Maccari & Ottanà, 2023). Although PTP1B gene expression (PTPN1) in ovarian tissues has only a modest direct association with PCOS according to some datasets (Ochoa et al., 2023), the molecular rationale is compelling: even if the gene association is weak, the phosphatase’s biochemical role in dephosphorylating the insulin receptor and its substrates remains central to insulin resistance. Therefore, in in vitro assays using PCOS granulosa cells, treatment with MK-4007 should restore or enhance the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of the insulin receptor, elevate IRS-1 activity, and ultimately increase phosphorylation of Akt. This cascade facilitates the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface, potentially alleviating the insulin resistance that contributes to the disordered folliculogenesis and hyperandrogenism observed in PCOS (Joharatnam, 2012; Diamanti-Kandarakis & Dunaif, 2012).

Moreover, given the reported favorable PK/PD and safety data in rodent models, MK-4007 appears well-suited for further investigation. The cellular and animal data from diabetic models provide a strong mechanistic foundation, suggesting that similar insulin-sensitizing effects could be realized in ovarian tissues. The expected outcome in the assay would be a quantifiable increase in insulin receptor and downstream signaling molecule phosphorylation, increased GLUT4 presence at the plasma membrane, and subsequently, enhanced glucose uptake into granulosa cells (Zhang et al., 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, the prospect of repurposing MK-4007 for PCOS treatment is scientifically intriguing and supported by a solid mechanistic basis. Strengths of this therapeutic candidate include:

• The well‐established role of PTP1B in negatively regulating insulin receptor signaling, which provides a clear rationale for why its inhibition would enhance insulin sensitivity. This is particularly important in PCOS, where aberrant insulin signaling contributes not only to metabolic abnormalities but also to reproductive dysfunction (Diamanti-Kandarakis & Dunaif, 2012; Joharatnam, 2012).
• Optimized cell permeability and oral bioavailability, as reported for MK-4007, increase the likelihood that effective drug concentrations are achieved in target tissues following systemic administration (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Maccari & Ottanà, 2023).
• Preclinical efficacy in diabetic rodent models demonstrates that the drug can enhance insulin receptor phosphorylation and restore downstream signaling cascades, a finding that is directly translatable to granulosa cell function given the similar insulin signaling machinery present across insulin-responsive tissues (Zhang et al., 2016; Boonloh et al., 2020).
• The competitive inhibition of PTP1B by MK-4007 is based on well-understood molecular interactions, which has been supported by structure-based studies and the use of phosphotyrosine mimetics that improve the drug’s potency and selectivity (Zhang & Zhang, 2007; Maccari & Ottanà, 2023).

Yet, several weaknesses or challenges remain:

• Clinical associations between PTPN1 (the gene encoding PTP1B) and PCOS are modest. Data from Open Targets show only a very low overall association score between PTPN1 and PCOS, suggesting that while the mechanistic rationale is sound, the direct genetic link is not robust (Ochoa et al., 2023).
• There is currently no direct clinical or preclinical data available that evaluates MK-4007 specifically in PCOS models or in ovarian granulosa cells. Most of the supportive evidence comes from diabetic rodent models, and while there is a clear mechanistic overlap between insulin resistance in T2DM and PCOS, one must be cautious when extrapolating these results to the ovarian environment (Diamanti-Kandarakis & Dunaif, 2012; Joharatnam, 2012).
• The safety profile, although favorable in rodent models, must be thoroughly evaluated in the context of reproductive tissues, as ovarian cells can be uniquely sensitive to perturbations in metabolic signaling. Furthermore, long-term effects on ovarian steroidogenesis and follicle development will need careful investigation (Ma et al., 2011; Maccari & Ottanà, 2023).
• Finally, the effectiveness of MK-4007 in enhancing GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake in granulosa cells must be specifically assessed, since most of the available data relate to muscle, liver, and adipose tissues. Direct experiments in ovarian cell models (e.g., primary granulosa cells from PCOS patients) are necessary to validate the hypothesis (Joharatnam, 2012; Diamanti-Kandarakis & Dunaif, 2012).

In conclusion, based on the current available literature, MK-4007 demonstrates significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for PCOS. Its ability to inhibit PTP1B—a key negative regulator of insulin signaling—provides a sound mechanistic rationale for enhancing insulin receptor phosphorylation, augmenting downstream PI3K/Akt pathway activation, and ultimately increasing GLUT4-dependent glucose uptake in insulin-resistant tissues, including ovarian granulosa cells. The strengths of MK-4007 lie in its optimized pharmacokinetic properties, demonstrated preclinical efficacy in metabolic disease models, and a compelling molecular mechanism that is relevant to the insulin signaling defects observed in PCOS. However, further targeted studies are required to assess its specific efficacy and safety in ovarian cells and to establish whether the improvements in insulin signaling translate into meaningful clinical benefits for PCOS patients. These studies should include in vitro experiments using granulosa cells derived from PCOS patients, in vivo studies in PCOS animal models, and eventually carefully designed clinical trials that monitor both metabolic and reproductive endpoints.

Overall, while there is a robust scientific foundation supporting the concept, additional research dedicated to the PCOS context is necessary before proceeding with clinical development. The promise of MK-4007 as a modulator of insulin resistance makes it a candidate worth further investigation, but its ultimate success will depend on demonstrating that restoring insulin signaling in ovarian tissues thereby corrects the metabolic and reproductive abnormalities that characterize PCOS (Zhang & Zhang, 2007; Diamanti-Kandarakis & Dunaif, 2012; Joharatnam, 2012).

Cilostazol (Otsuka Pharmaceutical; PDE3 inhibitor),"Proposal for Cilostazol (Otsuka Pharmaceutical; PDE3 inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Cilostazol is a synthetic small molecule originally developed for its vasodilatory and antiplatelet properties. It belongs to the phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor class and was discovered by Otsuka Pharmaceutical as part of an effort to identify agents that could improve blood flow in peripheral arterial disease, particularly for patients with intermittent claudication. This compound is fully chemically synthesized and, as a member of the PDE inhibitor class, acts by preventing the breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) within various cell types. This class of compounds has predominantly been used to improve vascular dilation and reduce platelet aggregation. The compound’s well-established pharmacokinetic profile and safety record in cardiovascular indications have provided a strong foundation for considering its repurposing to other disorders, such as metabolic and reproductive syndromes (Baillie, 2019, pp. 7–9).

Therapeutic History:
Cilostazol is currently FDA-approved for the treatment of intermittent claudication and has been used extensively in clinical settings for its cardiovascular benefits. Over the years, numerous clinical trials have been conducted in vascular and diabetic populations, with evidence supporting its ability to improve blood flow, reduce vascular inflammation, and even ameliorate certain metabolic disturbances. The clinical trial search “Cilostazol AND PCOS OR Polycystic Ovary Syndrome” returned over 1,000 studies, demonstrating significant research interest at the intersection of cilostazol’s vascular effects and metabolic conditions reminiscent of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although there is limited direct clinical evaluation of cilostazol in PCOS specifically, preclinical investigations and indirect clinical observations—such as its effects on oocyte maturation in animal models (Li et al., 2012, pp. 3–4)—suggest overlapping pathways that are relevant to reproductive endocrinology. Additionally, related PDE inhibitors in reproductive contexts, including studies assessing PDE4 inhibition in PCOS (Jensterle et al., 2014, pp. 4–6; Jensterle et al., 2015, pp. 1–2), further support the rationale for exploring the repurposing of cilostazol in a similar metabolic and endocrine context (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Li et al., 2012, pp. 3–4; Jensterle et al., 2014, pp. 4–6).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of cilostazol is well characterized at the molecular level. Cilostazol selectively inhibits PDE3, an enzyme responsible for degrading intracellular cAMP. By blocking PDE3 activity, cilostazol leads to sustained elevation of cAMP levels within vascular smooth muscle cells and platelets, thereby promoting vasodilation and inhibiting platelet aggregation. At a detailed biochemical level, increased levels of cAMP drive activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates a range of target proteins that regulate vascular tone, anti-inflammatory responses, and cellular metabolism (Baillie, 2019, pp. 7–9).

In the context of PCOS, and particularly within ovarian theca cells, the hypothesis is that elevating cAMP would have several beneficial downstream effects. Ovarian theca cells play a critical role in androgen synthesis, and their function is modulated by cyclic nucleotide signaling. Elevated cAMP could attenuate the aberrant steroidogenic activity seen in PCOS by modifying the activity of enzymes involved in androgen synthesis. Moreover, increased cAMP levels are known to exert anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the activation of inflammatory kinases and transcription factors such as NF-κB. This anti-inflammatory action is supported by findings in vascular and metabolic tissues where cilostazol reduced expression of adhesion molecules and inflammatory mediators (Agrawal et al., 2007, p. 6).

Furthermore, activation of the cAMP/PKA axis may also intersect with insulin receptor pathways. In many tissues, elevated cAMP has been implicated in sensitizing insulin action, partly by influencing the downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling cascade. Preclinical studies in vascular and adipose tissues have demonstrated that increased cAMP can lead to improved glucose uptake via enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling (Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016, pp. 9–12). Since insulin resistance is a central component of PCOS pathophysiology, cilostazol’s ability to modulate this pathway may prove beneficial in normalizing insulin action in ovarian cells. Of note, oocyte maturation studies have shown that PDE3 inhibition results in sustained cAMP elevation that leads to reversible arrest of meiosis without impairing subsequent developmental competence (Li et al., 2012, pp. 8–9). While these studies focus on the reproductive function rather than metabolic improvements, they underscore the importance of cyclic nucleotide signaling in ovarian biology, which is relevant to the proposed mechanism in PCOS (Baillie, 2019, pp. 7–9; Agrawal et al., 2007, p. 6; Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016, pp. 9–12; Li et al., 2012, pp. 8–9).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the expected effect of cilostazol in the context of PCOS is multi-faceted. First, by inhibiting PDE3 and elevating cAMP levels in ovarian theca cells, cilostazol could modulate steroidogenesis. Elevated cAMP may reduce excessive androgen production by rebalancing intracellular signaling in theca cells, a process that has been identified as aberrant in PCOS (Liu et al., 2015, pp. 4–6). Second, the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by increased cAMP and subsequent PKA activation might reduce the pro-inflammatory state that contributes to ovarian dysfunction in PCOS. Several studies have implicated chronic low-grade inflammation in the ovarian tissue of PCOS patients, and cilostazol’s known ability to decrease inflammatory kinase activation offers a promising therapeutic angle (Agrawal et al., 2007, p. 6). Third, and perhaps most significantly for metabolic regulation, cilostazol is hypothesized to enhance insulin receptor downstream signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Preclinical evidence demonstrates that improved insulin signaling, as a result of cAMP elevation, can increase glucose uptake and improve insulin sensitivity in vascular and adipose tissues (Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016, pp. 9–12; Tohma et al., 2019, pp. 4–5). Given that insulin resistance is a key pathological feature of PCOS, particularly in theca and granulosa cells, enhancing the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade would be expected to improve ovarian metabolic function and possibly restore normal follicular development and ovulation (Liu & Zhou, 2024, pp. 9–10). Additionally, the literature on computational and gene expression profiling in PCOS suggests altered cyclic nucleotide signaling is part of the complex metabolic dysregulation in this syndrome (Liu et al., 2015, pp. 6–7). This reinforces the potential for cilostazol to act beneficially by normalizing these dysregulated pathways.

Overall Evaluation:
Cilostazol presents a promising opportunity for repurposing in the treatment of PCOS, especially for its potential to address both metabolic and reproductive aspects of the disease. One of the major strengths of this candidate is its established clinical use and FDA approval in vascular disorders, which means that its pharmacokinetic properties, safety profile, and side-effect spectrum are already well characterized. This reduces the uncertainty related to toxicity and dosing when compared to entirely novel compounds. In addition, its mechanism of elevating intracellular cAMP is supported by a substantial body of literature in both vascular and reproductive contexts. Studies demonstrating reversible effects on oocyte maturation (Li et al., 2012, pp. 8–9) and anti-inflammatory actions in metabolic tissues (Agrawal et al., 2007, p. 6) provide compelling, albeit indirect, evidence that the same mechanism may be beneficial in ovarian theca cells where abnormal insulin signaling and inflammation underlie PCOS pathology. Another strength is that the hypothesis leverages preclinical findings on PDE inhibitors’ ability to stimulate insulin receptor downstream PI3K/Akt signaling, thereby improving glucose uptake—a hallmark challenge in PCOS. Given that other PDE inhibitors, such as PDE4 inhibitors, have shown promising effects in PCOS models (Jensterle et al., 2014, pp. 4–6; Jensterle et al., 2015, pp. 1–2), there is a strong rationale to extend these observations to PDE3 inhibitors like cilostazol.

However, there are notable weaknesses and gaps. Direct clinical or preclinical data regarding cilostazol’s effect on ovarian theca cells, specifically concerning inflammation reduction, insulin signaling enhancement, and improved glucose uptake, are currently lacking. Most of the evidence for cilostazol comes from studies focused on vascular tissue and oocyte maturation; the translation of these effects to the metabolic and inflammatory dysfunctions in PCOS remains largely theoretical at this point. Moreover, while the safety profile of cilostazol is established in patients with peripheral arterial disease, its long-term effects in a reproductive setting, particularly in women with PCOS who may have distinct cardiovascular and metabolic profiles, require additional scrutiny. Furthermore, there is the possibility that off-target effects in the ovary, or differences in PDE3 isoform expression between vascular tissues and ovarian tissues, might result in unanticipated outcomes. These uncertainties underscore the need for dedicated pharmacodynamic and mechanistic studies in ovarian cell models and animal models of PCOS before advancing to clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In summary, while cilostazol has a compelling profile due to its well-characterized mechanism of increasing cAMP levels and its proven efficacy in improving insulin signaling and reducing inflammation in other tissues, its potential in PCOS specifically is still emerging. The strengths lie in its established use, known safety, and a robust mechanistic rationale that aligns with key aspects of PCOS pathogenesis—including ovarian insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism driven by aberrant theca cell function. The weaknesses center on the current paucity of direct evidence in ovarian and reproductive models of PCOS, warranting further targeted studies to validate its efficacy in this new application. Considering the significant therapeutic need in PCOS and the extensive preclinical data supporting PDE inhibition in metabolic regulation, a focused research program evaluating cilostazol’s impact on ovarian cAMP dynamics, inflammatory responses, PI3K/Akt insulin signaling, and glucose uptake in theca cells is justified. These studies would elucidate whether the favorable profile seen in vascular and adipose tissues can be replicated in the ovarian environment and potentially offer a novel, repurposed therapeutic strategy for PCOS (Baillie, 2019, pp. 7–9; Li et al., 2012, pp. 3–4; Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016, pp. 9–12; Liu et al., 2015, pp. 4–6; Jensterle et al., 2014, pp. 4–6; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of everolimus as a potential repurposed therapeutic candidate for treating Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). The following report examines the candidate from multiple perspectives using current biochemical, cellular, preclinical, and clinical insights drawn from the literature provided.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Everolimus is an orally administered, semi‐synthetic derivative of sirolimus (rapamycin) that belongs to the “rapalog” family of mTOR inhibitors. It was developed through chemical modification of rapamycin, which itself is a macrolide isolated from the soil bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus. This chemical derivatization was undertaken to improve upon the natural product’s oral bioavailability, water solubility, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics while maintaining its ability to target the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) selectively (Liu et al., 2016; Thimmanahalli, 2014). As a member of the targeted kinase inhibitor class specifically aimed at modulating intracellular signaling pathways, everolimus exerts its effects by binding intracellularly to FKBP12. The resulting everolimus–FKBP12 complex then interacts with the FKBP12–rapamycin binding (FRB) domain of mTOR, leading to the inhibition of mTORC1 activity. This mode of action has been central to therapies in other disease indications where unchecked cell proliferation, metabolic dysregulation, or abnormal cellular growth are factors. In clinical practice, everolimus has been utilized to prevent organ transplant rejection, as well as in the treatment of several cancers such as renal cell carcinoma and certain neuroendocrine tumors, as well as settings like tuberous sclerosis complex (Liu et al., 2016; Thimmanahalli, 2014). The underlying principle of mTORC1 inhibition – reducing aberrant signals that drive excessive protein synthesis, cell proliferation, and metabolic activity – is especially relevant given that PCOS is characterized by disturbances in ovarian folliculogenesis and insulin signaling.

Therapeutic History
Everolimus has a robust clinical and preclinical history in diverse therapeutic arenas. It has been widely used in the transplantation field as an immunosuppressant to prevent graft rejection. In oncology, its role in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis is well documented. Its safety and pharmacokinetic profiles have been delineated in multiple clinical trials, demonstrating manageable adverse events such as immunosuppression, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance in patient populations where these side effects are mitigated through careful dosing strategies (Hensley et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2016).

Notably, while everolimus has been approved and extensively evaluated for uses in cancer and transplant medicine, searches specifically for its use in PCOS or related ovarian metabolic dysfunctions via clinical trial registries have yielded zero results (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, preclinical investigations and mechanistic studies indicate that the mTOR signaling pathway is dysregulated in PCOS, particularly in ovarian granulosa cells. These cells are central to follicle development and insulin signaling, and dysregulation in mTOR activity can lead to the insulin resistance and follicular arrest characteristic of PCOS (Liu et al., 2016; Bajwa, 2018). Additionally, similar compounds in the rapalog class have been evaluated in contexts that mirror aspects of PCOS pathophysiology, including aberrant folliculogenesis and abnormal ovarian insulin signaling. Hence, despite the absence of direct clinical trial data in PCOS, there is sufficient rationale supporting the exploration of everolimus in this new indication.

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, everolimus exerts its activity by selectively inhibiting mTORC1. The process begins with everolimus binding to the immunophilin FKBP12 within the cell. This complex is then able to attach to the FRB domain of mTOR. Under normal circumstances, mTORC1 integrates various upstream signals such as nutrient availability, energy status, growth factors, and stress signals to regulate key downstream effectors. Among these downstream targets are p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1). When p70S6K is activated, it phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6, thereby stimulating protein synthesis and promoting cell growth and proliferation (Liu et al., 2016; Thimmanahalli, 2014).

In the ovarian microenvironment, particularly within granulosa cells, controlled mTORC1 activity is essential for proper folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation. These cells rely on mTORC1 signaling for regulated proliferation and differentiation so that follicles can progress normally. In PCOS, there is convincing evidence that hyperactivation of mTORC1 contributes to abnormal granulosa cell proliferation, disrupted follicle maturation, and defective insulin signaling. Specifically, the overactivation of mTORC1 leads to increased activity of p70S6K. This in turn causes serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), which is a negative feedback mechanism. When IRS-1 is hyperphosphorylated on serine residues, its ability to propagate signals downstream to the PI3K/Akt pathway is substantially impaired, thereby contributing to insulin resistance in the ovary (Liu et al., 2016; Sercombe, n.d.).

Moreover, proper insulin signaling is critical for stimulating the translocation of GLUT4, a glucose transporter, to the plasma membrane, ensuring efficient glucose uptake. In a state of insulin resistance, as observed in PCOS, impaired GLUT4 translocation further exacerbates metabolic dysfunction in ovarian tissues. Everolimus, by inhibiting mTORC1, is proposed to interrupt this detrimental sequence. By counteracting excessive p70S6K activity, it could reduce the aberrant serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, thereby mitigating the negative feedback loop and restoring effective PI3K/Akt signaling. The restoration of proper signaling is expected to facilitate the translocation of GLUT4, ultimately improving insulin sensitivity in granulosa cells (Liu et al., 2016; Sercombe, n.d.).

Preclinical studies provide additional support for this mode of action. In vitro ovarian models and rodent studies that simulate PCOS-like conditions have shown that modulating mTOR activity can lead to normalization of granulosa cell proliferation and improved folliculogenesis. In these models, the use of mTOR inhibitors has resulted in diminished markers of mTOR hyperactivity along with improved cellular responses in the insulin signaling cascade (Sercombe, n.d.; Bajwa, 2018).

Expected Effect
The expectation behind repurposing everolimus in PCOS is centered on its capacity to correct ovarian insulin resistance by normalizing hyperactive mTORC1 signaling in granulosa cells. In PCOS, granulosa cells often exhibit excessively active mTORC1 signaling, leading to the overactivation of p70S6K. This cascade results in increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which dampens the signaling throughput via the PI3K/Akt pathway. The diminished PI3K/Akt activity hampers insulin’s ability to stimulate GLUT4 translocation, thereby reducing glucose uptake and contributing further to insulin resistance (Liu et al., 2016; Sercombe, n.d.).

Upon administration, everolimus is expected to inhibit mTORC1 effectively, thus reducing the activity of p70S6K. With lower p70S6K activity, the inhibitory serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 would decrease. As a consequence, IRS-1 can better engage with PI3K, consequently leading to enhanced activation of Akt. Improved PI3K/Akt signaling would then restore the insulin-mediated translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface, thereby enhancing cellular glucose uptake and overall insulin sensitivity within the ovarian microenvironment (Liu et al., 2016; Sercombe, n.d.).

In the context of granulosa cell function, the normalization of these signaling pathways should promote proper cell proliferation and differentiation, thereby enabling healthier follicle development. In experimental models, the correction of granulosa cell proliferation through mTOR pathway modulation has been associated with normalized follicular dynamics, decreased cyst formation, and an improvement in markers of ovarian insulin sensitivity. This suggests that everolimus could not only address the metabolic derangements due to insulin resistance but also improve the reproductive outcomes by supporting the maturation of follicles needed for ovulation (Liu et al., 2016; Sercombe, n.d.).

It is important to note that the therapeutic action of everolimus in this setting is expected to be cytostatic rather than cytotoxic. The goal is to moderate the aberrant overproliferation of granulosa cells and restore a more normal cellular state, rather than inducing cell death. This aspect is critical in preserving the ovarian reserve and ensuring that the treatment does not adversely affect overall follicle viability. The desired outcome would be improved folliculogenesis coupled with better insulin sensitivity, which together could alleviate key clinical features of PCOS such as polycystic ovarian morphology, ovulatory dysfunction, and metabolic insufficiency (Liu et al., 2016; Sercombe, n.d.).

Overall, the expected cascade of effects starts with everolimus-mediated inhibition of mTORC1, leading to reduced p70S6K activation, which reinstates normal IRS-1 signaling. The subsequent emergence of effective PI3K/Akt activity promotes proper GLUT4 translocation and insulin sensitivity in ovarian granulosa cells, thereby contributing to a normalization of follicular development and overall metabolic balance in the ovary (Liu et al., 2016; Sercombe, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation
In evaluating everolimus as a repurposed candidate for PCOS, several strengths and challenges emerge based on the available literature.

One of the core strengths is the well-defined mechanism of action of everolimus. Its selective inhibition of mTORC1 is already well documented in oncology and transplant contexts, and the biochemical pathways that it targets are explicitly implicated in PCOS pathology. The hyperactivation of mTORC1 in ovarian granulosa cells, which leads to dysregulated p70S6K activity and subsequent negative feedback on IRS-1, provides a strong mechanistic rationale for the use of everolimus in restoring normal insulin receptor function. With the normalization of IRS-1 signaling, the downstream PI3K/Akt pathway can be reactivated, thereby promoting GLUT4 translocation and improved cellular glucose uptake. This mechanism directly addresses a critical feature of PCOS, namely insulin resistance at the ovarian level (Liu et al., 2016; Sercombe, n.d.).

Additionally, everolimus benefits from an extensive clinical history. Its use in preventing organ rejection and treating various cancers means that there is a tremendous amount of data available on its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, dosing strategies, and safety profile. Adverse effects such as immunosuppression, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance have been observed, but these are well characterized and can be managed with dose adjustments and patient monitoring (Hensley et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2016; Mahmood et al., 2013). This robust dataset provides confidence that, from a repurposing perspective, everolimus can be rapidly advanced into early-phase clinical trials for PCOS if the preclinical rationale is confirmed.

From a preclinical standpoint, several studies using in vitro ovarian models and rodent experiments demonstrate that modulation of the mTOR signaling pathway can reverse aberrant ovarian phenotypes. For instance, there is evidence that mTOR inhibitors can restore normal granulosa cell proliferation and promote proper folliculogenesis, which are crucial for ovulatory competence (Sercombe, n.d.; Bajwa, 2018). Moreover, the role of mTOR in regulating insulin signaling cascades, including PI3K/Akt and GLUT4 translocation, has been substantiated in multiple studies, lending further support to the hypothesis that everolimus could correct metabolic anomalies in PCOS (Liu et al., 2016).

Notwithstanding these strengths, several challenges must be addressed. A significant drawback is the absence of direct clinical evidence for everolimus in PCOS patients. Currently, there are no registered clinical trials specifically investigating its efficacy in the context of PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Much of the supporting data are derived from preclinical models or indirectly from studies conducted in oncology and transplant medicine. Extrapolating these findings to the complex endocrine milieu of PCOS carries inherent risks due to differences in disease pathology, patient demographics, and treatment endpoints (Liu et al., 2016; Sercombe, n.d.).

Furthermore, PCOS is a multifactorial disorder characterized not only by insulin resistance and aberrant folliculogenesis but also by hyperandrogenism, chronic low-grade inflammation, and neuroendocrine dysregulation. While everolimus targets mTORC1 and can theoretically restore proper insulin signaling, it is uncertain how effectively it will modulate the other burgeoning aspects of PCOS pathophysiology. For example, hyperandrogenism has widespread effects throughout the ovary and on systemic metabolic function, and mTOR dysregulation may represent only one facet of this complex network (Sercombe, n.d.).

Additionally, although the cytostatic nature of mTOR inhibitors is beneficial in terms of preventing overproliferation of granulosa cells, there is a risk that excessive inhibition might adversely affect normal ovarian function. Preclinical models have shown that mTOR inhibition, if not properly calibrated, can interfere with normal ovulatory processes, delay pubertal onset, or even contribute to ovarian atrophy. These risks emphasize the necessity for careful dose optimization and appropriate patient selection in any future clinical trial (Liu et al., 2016; Sercombe, n.d.).

Another potential concern centers on the systemic metabolic effects of everolimus. While the goal is to improve ovarian insulin sensitivity, everolimus is also known to induce hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in other patient populations. It is crucial to determine whether these adverse effects will be offset by the improvements in local ovarian insulin signaling or whether they might worsen the metabolic profile of patients with PCOS, who already have a predisposition to metabolic syndrome (Liu et al., 2016; Mahmood et al., 2013).

In summary, everolimus offers a compelling and scientifically rational candidate for repurposing in PCOS due to its selective inhibition of mTORC1, a key driver of the insulin signaling abnormalities and follicular dysfunction observed in this syndrome. Its mechanism—reducing p70S6K-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of IRS-1 to restore PI3K/Akt/GLUT4 signaling—addresses a fundamental defect in PCOS pathophysiology. The extensive clinical experience with everolimus in other settings provides a strong basis for safety and pharmacological predictability. However, the lack of direct clinical data in PCOS, potential risks related to off-target systemic effects, and the multifactorial nature of PCOS remain significant challenges that must be addressed through careful preclinical optimization and eventual clinical trials.

Moving forward, targeted preclinical studies should focus on evaluating everolimus in robust in vitro ovarian models and relevant rodent models of PCOS. These studies should assess not only improvements in insulin signaling and GLUT4 translocation in granulosa cells but also the broader impact on folliculogenesis and systemic metabolic parameters. Should these studies yield promising results, they would justify early-phase clinical trials in carefully selected PCOS populations with the aim of determining the therapeutic window, dosing regimen, and potential biomarkers of response. The overall promise of everolimus as a novel intervention for PCOS thus rests on its ability to rebalance ovarian insulin signaling and restore normal follicular dynamics while managing the inherent risks associated with mTOR inhibition (Liu et al., 2016; Sercombe, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hensley et al., 2020).

Overall, despite the challenges highlighted, everolimus represents a promising and rational candidate for repurposing in the treatment of PCOS. Its established mechanism, well-characterized clinical profile, and supportive preclinical evidence provide a strong foundation—if future targeted studies can confirm paracrine and systemic benefits without undue side effects. Given the substantial unmet need in PCOS treatment, particularly in addressing the metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions that drive patient morbidity, everolimus bears significant translational potential that merits further investigation.

Bardoxolone methyl (Reata Pharmaceuticals; Nrf2 activator),"Proposal for Bardoxolone methyl (Reata Pharmaceuticals; Nrf2 activator)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Bardoxolone methyl is a synthetic triterpenoid derived from natural oleanolic acid, a compound originally isolated from olive oil and medicinal plants such as Salvia. Chemically, it belongs to the class of synthetic oleanane triterpenoids that have been modified to enhance bioactivity through improved potency and pharmacokinetic characteristics. Bardoxolone methyl was designed via synthetic medicinal chemistry methods to bolster the innate antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties inherent in its natural precursor. This design strategy incorporates modifications that allow the drug to activate the transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2) robustly, thereby upregulating genes involved in cytoprotection and detoxification (Al-Sawaf et al., 2015; Camer et al., 2015).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, bardoxolone methyl has been primarily developed and evaluated in the contexts of chronic kidney disease (CKD), type 2 diabetes, and various forms of cancer. Several clinical trials have assessed its renal and metabolic benefits in patients with diabetic nephropathy and CKD, where its effects on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were documented. In oncology, early-phase clinical studies demonstrated that bardoxolone methyl modulated inflammatory pathways and exerted anticancer effects by inhibiting NF-κB signaling and inducing differentiation in tumor cells (Hong et al., 2012). Importantly, searches on ClinicalTrials.gov combining “Bardoxolone methyl OR Nrf2 activator” with terms such as “Polycystic Ovary Syndrome OR PCOS OR insulin resistance OR oxidative stress” have identified 33 clinical studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although bardoxolone methyl has not been directly used as a standard treatment in PCOS, its prominent use in diseases characterized by oxidative stress and metabolic dysregulation suggests potential applicability. Its insulin-sensitizing effects observed in metabolic disorders and improvements in renal function from clinical trials are promising indicators for drug repurposing in PCOS, a condition where oxidative stress and insulin resistance form key pathogenic mechanisms (Hai & Wang, 2011; Yagishita et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
Bardoxolone methyl’s principal mechanism of action involves the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytosol by Keap1, which tags it for proteasomal degradation. Bardoxolone methyl disrupts this interaction by electrophilically modifying cysteine residues on Keap1, thereby releasing Nrf2 from its repressor. Once liberated, Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of target genes. This induces the expression of numerous cytoprotective and antioxidant enzymes, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), superoxide dismutases, and various phase II detoxification enzymes (Al-Sawaf et al., 2015; Yagishita et al., 2020).

In addition to elevating antioxidant defenses, bardoxolone methyl inhibits NF-κB signaling, partly by direct inhibition of IKKβ. This dual action reduces the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and suppresses inflammatory kinase cascades such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Since increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate proinflammatory signals including JNK, the reduction of ROS through Nrf2 activation decreases the serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). This is crucial because serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 impairs its ability to propagate insulin signals via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which is integral to cellular glucose uptake (Dinh et al., 2015; Hong et al., 2012). Moreover, preclinical studies, including those performed in rodent high-fat diet models, have demonstrated that bardoxolone methyl can prevent hepatic steatosis and improve insulin sensitivity through these antioxidative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms (Camer et al., 2015). These molecular interactions are directly relevant to the pathophysiology of PCOS, where oxidative stress and disrupted insulin signaling in ovarian granulosa cells lead to metabolic dysfunction and reproductive disturbances (Al-Sawaf et al., 2015).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing bardoxolone methyl in the context of PCOS focuses on its ability to activate Nrf2 in ovarian granulosa cells. In these cells, enhanced Nrf2 activity is expected to upregulate a suite of antioxidant and detoxification genes, thereby reducing intra-cellular levels of reactive oxygen species and restoring redox balance (Al-Sawaf et al., 2015; Ogiso et al., 2022). The resultant attenuation of oxidative stress is anticipated to suppress the activation of stress-related kinases such as JNK. Since JNK is known to phosphorylate IRS-1 on serine residues, its suppression should reduce inhibitory phosphorylation of IRS-1. This is expected to restore the functionality of IRS-1, allowing for proper activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and subsequent glucose uptake into granulosa cells (Hai & Wang, 2011). Consequently, by mitigating these disruptions in insulin signaling, bardoxolone methyl could improve the metabolic environment within the ovary, potentially correcting insulin resistance that is often observed in PCOS patients. In support, various studies in diabetic and high-fat diet models have indicated that bardoxolone methyl improves insulin sensitivity and reduces features of metabolic syndrome by modulating these pathways (Camer et al., 2015; Dinh et al., 2015). Furthermore, the expression of Nrf2 and its downstream targets in ovarian tissue has been documented, bolstering the rationale that pharmacological activation can impact these cells directly (Yagishita et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
Bardoxolone methyl presents a compelling therapeutic candidate for repurposing in PCOS based on its well-documented mechanism of activating Nrf2 and simultaneously dampening proinflammatory signaling. One of its major strengths lies in its dual mode of action: by inducing antioxidant genes and suppressing NF-κB and JNK pathways, it offers a multifaceted approach to address both oxidative stress and insulin resistance, two core pathophysiological features of PCOS (Hong et al., 2012; Yagishita et al., 2020). Additionally, the existence of nearly 33 clinical trials exploring Nrf2 activators in metabolic, inflammatory, and oxidative stress-related contexts—although not exclusively in PCOS—supports the translational potential of this approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, there are notable challenges that must be considered. Firstly, while the preclinical and clinical data in other disease models are promising, direct evidence of efficacy in PCOS is limited. Ovarian granulosa cells have specific hormonal and paracrine architectures that may respond differently to Nrf2 modulation compared to renal or hepatic cells. The precise dosing regimen and long-term safety profile in a younger, predominantly female population—typical of PCOS patients—would need systematic evaluation. Some clinical trials of bardoxolone methyl in CKD have reported adverse events, including transient liver enzyme elevations and cardiovascular concerns in certain high-risk populations, which necessitates cautious patient selection and monitoring (Sakashita et al., 2021; de Zeeuw et al., 2013).

A further consideration is the balance between achieving sufficient Nrf2 activation to confer metabolic benefits and avoiding overactivation that could lead to undesired effects. For instance, excessive antioxidant activity might interfere with necessary redox signaling, which plays roles in normal cellular function and immune responses (Al-Sawaf et al., 2015). Moreover, it is critical to note that while bardoxolone methyl has shown insulin-sensitizing and cytoprotective properties in preclinical models, the complexity of PCOS—which encompasses hormonal dysregulation, reproductive dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances—may require combination approaches or adjunctive therapies to achieve optimal clinical outcomes (Dinh et al., 2015; Hong et al., 2012).

In summary, bardoxolone methyl is a well-characterized Nrf2 activator with a robust mechanistic rationale for repurposing in PCOS. Its ability to upregulate antioxidant defenses, suppress inflammatory signaling pathways, ameliorate oxidative stress-induced insulin resistance, and restore normal insulin receptor signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway is directly aligned with the therapeutic needs in PCOS granulosa cells (Hai & Wang, 2011; Camer et al., 2015). The repurposing strategy is further supported by extensive clinical trial data demonstrating manageable safety and favorable pharmacokinetics in other disease contexts. Nevertheless, targeted investigations specifically in PCOS models are essential to validate the hypothesis, determine optimal dosing, and fully understand the impact on ovarian physiology. Strengths of this candidate include its dual antioxidant and anti-inflammatory profile, known clinical data, and the strategic targeting of a critical pathway implicated in PCOS pathogenesis. Weaknesses or challenges include the need for careful adjustment of dosing in the reproductive-age population, potential adverse effects observed in other populations, and the requirement to translate findings from renal and cancer studies to the unique environment of ovarian granulosa cells (Dinh et al., 2015; Hong et al., 2012).

Overall, the evidence supports that bardoxolone methyl is a promising candidate for repurposing in PCOS due to its established Nrf2-dependent mechanism of action and its associated metabolic and insulin-sensitizing effects. Further focused preclinical studies and carefully designed clinical trials in PCOS patient populations are warranted to fully elucidate its utility in this indication (Yagishita et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of A-769662 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), structured in five sections, with inline citations from the provided context.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
A-769662 is a fully synthetic small‐molecule that belongs to the thienopyridone class of compounds. It was discovered through high‐throughput screening efforts aimed at identifying molecules capable of directly activating the master metabolic regulator, AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK). Unlike indirect activators such as metformin and AICAR that modify intracellular AMP:ATP ratios via mitochondrial inhibition, A-769662 directly binds to a novel allosteric regulatory site known as the ADaM (allosteric drug and metabolite) site. This unique site lies at the interface between the N-terminal lobe of the catalytic α subunit and the carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) of the β subunit of AMPK (Cool et al., 2006). Through this direct binding mechanism, the compound provides allosteric activation of the enzyme and simultaneously protects the critical Thr172 phosphorylation on the α‐subunit from dephosphorylation, both of which are required for full AMPK activity (Hardie, 2016). Marketed under Sigma-Aldrich catalog #SML0035, A-769662 has been widely used as a tool compound in preclinical studies that explore its effects on metabolic homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Moreover, with the emerging recognition of reduced AMPK activity in PCOS-derived ovarian cells, this compound is now being revisited for its potential to restore proper metabolic function in ovarian granulosa cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Because its mechanism is based on direct binding, A-769662 belongs to the class of direct allosteric AMPK activators—a class previously validated in multiple metabolic disease models, including models of insulin resistance and obesity (Cool et al., 2006).

Therapeutic History:
Preclinical evidence and investigations in rodent models have provided extensive insight into the metabolic benefits of AMPK activation using compounds like A-769662. In early studies, administration of A-769662 in animal models of type 2 diabetes and obesity resulted in enhanced insulin sensitivity, reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis, and amelioration of hyperglycemia (Cool et al., 2006). The compound was demonstrated to improve metabolic indices in insulin-resistant conditions by elevating AMPK activity in key metabolic tissues, such as the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. For example, in skeletal muscle, treatment with A-769662 was shown to stimulate the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase – a well-known downstream target of AMPK – which in turn promoted fatty acid oxidation and suppressed lipogenesis (Treebak et al., 2009). Although the majority of these studies have historically focused on tissues classically involved in energy homeostasis, further research has noted that one of the hallmarks of PCOS is reduced AMPK activity, particularly in ovarian granulosa cells. These cells are crucial for follicular development and steroidogenesis, and reduced AMPK signaling has been correlated with both impaired insulin action and abnormal steroid hormone production in PCOS (Dupont et al., 2012). Even though A-769662 itself has not been directly evaluated in extensive clinical trials for PCOS, a search in the Clinical Trial database reveals sustained interest in both A-769662 and other AMPK activators for the treatment of PCOS, highlighting the translational potential of compounds that target this pathway (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, studies in other metabolic conditions have confirmed that direct AMPK activation can lead to improvements in insulin signaling cascades, an effect that is highly desirable in addressing the ovarian insulin resistance observed in PCOS (Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016).

Mechanism of Action:
A-769662 functions by a mechanism that is distinguished by its direct allosteric activation of AMPK. The compound binds to the ADaM site on AMPK, a well-characterized pocket located at the junction of the kinase domain of the α subunit and the CBM of the β subunit. This binding is selective for β1-containing AMPK isoform complexes, which are critical in several insulin-sensitive tissues and have now been implicated in ovarian granulosa cells (Cool et al., 2006; Treebak et al., 2009). When A-769662 binds, it induces a conformational rearrangement in the AMPK holoenzyme that enhances its catalytic activity and, notably, protects the phosphorylated Thr172 residue from dephosphorylation. This post-translational modification is central to maintaining AMPK in its active state and thereby ensures continual activation of the kinase (Hardie, 2016).

Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates a host of downstream targets involved in both anabolic and catabolic processes. One of the key substrates is acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), whose phosphorylation by AMPK results in a reduction in malonyl-CoA levels and an increase in fatty acid oxidation while inhibiting processes such as lipogenesis (Chung et al., 2021). Moreover, AMPK activation intersects with the insulin signaling cascade by promoting the translocation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the plasma membrane. This effect is mediated at least in part by the enhancement of the downstream PI3K/Akt pathway. Enhanced Akt phosphorylation correlates with increased GLUT4 translocation and improved insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (Caplan, 2022).
In the context of PCOS, granulosa cells exhibit reduced AMPK activity, which compromises the insulin signaling network, ultimately leading to decreased GLUT4 translocation and defective glucose uptake. In these cells, impaired AMPK function may also contribute to dysregulated steroidogenic enzyme expression and abnormal hormone production (Dupont et al., 2012; Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016). By directly activating AMPK independently of upstream kinases such as LKB1 and CaMKK, A-769662 is positioned to restore the normal phosphorylation cascade, thereby re-establishing the metabolic balance and glucose responsiveness in granulosa cells. This restoration is expected to benefit not only the energy metabolism of these cells but also their steroidogenic functions, which are closely linked to proper ovulatory processes (Froment et al., 2022).

In biochemical detail, the binding of A-769662 to AMPK mimics the action of AMP but without the attendant increase in intracellular AMP:ATP ratios. This ensures that the activation of the kinase occurs without the potential cytotoxic consequences of cellular energy depletion. By preferentially targeting β1-containing complexes, A-769662 has the potential to act in tissues where these isoforms predominate, including the liver, muscle, and, importantly, ovarian tissue. The compound’s high degree of cell permeability and favorable pharmacokinetic properties observed in animal models suggest that it can reach intracellular AMPK pools effectively, thus producing a robust activation of the metabolic pathways necessary for insulin sensitization (Cool et al., 2006; Treebak et al., 2009; Hardie, 2016).

Expected Effect:
Based on the well-documented defects in PCOS-associated granulosa cells, the central hypothesis is that direct activation of AMPK using A-769662 will ameliorate the impaired insulin signaling observed in these cells. In PCOS, reduced AMPK activity is implicated in a cascade of metabolic disturbances, including diminished PI3K/Akt pathway activity and compromised GLUT4 translocation, which ultimately results in defective insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (Dupont et al., 2012; Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016).

When A-769662 is applied to PCOS-derived granulosa cells, it is expected first to restore the suppressed AMPK activity by re-establishing the phosphorylation status of Thr172 on the α subunit. This normalization of AMPK activity will then trigger downstream signaling events, most critically the enhancement of the PI3K/Akt phosphorylation cascade. Enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling is known to be critical for the mobilization of GLUT4 to the cell membrane, facilitating improved insulin-mediated glucose transport into the cell (Caplan, 2022). In metabolic tissues where similar mechanisms have been studied, direct activation of AMPK with A-769662 has been shown to increase glucose uptake by elevating GLUT4 translocation (Treebak et al., 2009).

In the ovarian context, specifically in granulosa cells where insulin signaling is essential for proper steroidogenesis and energy metabolism, the expected effects are multifold. First, A-769662’s direct activation of AMPK would re-establish a balanced energy state necessary for normal cellular functions. Second, by potentiating PI3K/Akt signaling, the compound would promote GLUT4 trafficking to the plasma membrane, thereby increasing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake—a defect commonly observed in PCOS granulosa cells (Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016; Froment et al., 2022). Third, correction of the insulin signaling cascade through AMPK activation may also lead to normalized expression of key steroidogenic enzymes, thereby addressing the hyperandrogenism and aberrant hormone production that are hallmarks of PCOS (Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016).

This proposed mechanistic cascade—from restoration of AMPK activity to enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling and increased GLUT4 translocation—is supported by both in vitro metabolic studies in other tissues and by emerging data in ovarian models. In fact, studies have demonstrated that reduced AMPK activity is correlated with impaired insulin responsiveness in granulosa cells, thus providing a strong rationale for the use of direct AMPK activators to reverse these effects (Dupont et al., 2012; Froment et al., 2022). Furthermore, the activation of AMPK by A-769662 occurs without triggering compensatory increases in metabolic stress, which is especially important when considering off‐target or systemic adverse consequences. As a result, the overall metabolic reprogramming induced by A-769662 is anticipated to improve both insulin sensitivity and hormonal balance in the ovaries of PCOS patients.

Overall Evaluation:
A-769662 possesses a robust mechanistic rationale for repurposing as a therapeutic agent in PCOS, primarily due to its capacity to directly activate AMPK in conditions where it is deficient. Several key strengths and areas of caution must be considered:

Strengths:
• Mechanistic Specificity and Direct Activation:
A significant strength of A-769662 is its ability to directly and selectively activate AMPK by binding to the ADaM site. This property ensures that normal AMPK function can be restored independently of upstream signaling through LKB1 or CaMKK, thereby minimizing potential variability associated with indirect activation approaches (Cool et al., 2006; Hardie, 2016). Its specificity towards β1-containing AMPK complexes means that it can be particularly effective in cells where these isoforms are prevalent, such as in the metabolic tissues studied and potentially in ovarian granulosa cells (Dupont et al., 2012).

• Preclinical Efficacy in Metabolic Models:
The body of work using A-769662 in rodent models of diabetes and obesity demonstrates that the compound can improve insulin sensitivity, lower glucose levels, and favorably modulate lipid metabolism (Cool et al., 2006; Treebak et al., 2009). Given the strong parallels between the metabolic dysfunction in these conditions and the insulin resistance observed in PCOS, there is a compelling translational rationale for its repurposing in an ovarian context (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

• Restoration of Downstream Insulin Signaling:
The anticipated chain of events—from restoring AMPK phosphorylation and activity, to enhancing PI3K/Akt phosphorylation, to ultimately promoting GLUT4 translocation—is highly attractive because it directly addresses the metabolic defects that underlie PCOS. Studies have shown that granulosa cells from PCOS patients demonstrate reduced AMPK activity and defective insulin signaling, supporting the hypothesis that boosting these pathways can reverse cellular insulin resistance and correct steroidogenic abnormalities (Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016; Froment et al., 2022; Caplan, 2022).

• Translational Feasibility and Favorable Pharmacodynamics:
The favorable cell permeability of A-769662, along with its ability to activate AMPK without elevating intracellular AMP levels or producing metabolic stress, suggests that it may have a tolerable safety profile relative to indirect activators. Existing pharmacokinetic and safety data from preclinical metabolic studies provide a foundation for repurposing, thereby potentially shortening the path to early clinical trials in PCOS contexts (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Weaknesses and Challenges:
• Limited Direct Evidence in Ovarian Models:
A primary challenge is the scarcity of direct data on A-769662’s effects in ovarian granulosa cells. Although robust preclinical evidence exists for its efficacy in liver and skeletal muscle, ovarian tissue has unique metabolic and hormonal dynamics that may affect the drug’s performance. Future studies must therefore specifically assess the impact of A-769662 on human granulosa cells isolated from PCOS patients to validate the expected improvement in AMPK activity and downstream signaling (Dupont et al., 2012; Froment et al., 2022).

• Isoform Specificity Considerations:
Because A-769662 preferentially activates AMPK complexes containing the β1 subunit, its effectiveness may vary depending on the isoform distribution present in ovarian tissue. The precise composition of AMPK heterotrimers in granulosa cells may differ from that in skeletal muscle or liver, potentially limiting the efficacy of the compound unless these differences are carefully characterized and accounted for during dosing studies (Dupont et al., 2012).

• Potential Off-Target Effects and Safety Profile:
There is some literature that suggests compounds in this class can exhibit off‐target effects, including inhibition of certain proteasomal activities or interference with membrane ATPases (Tarasiuk et al., 2022). While such effects may not be severe, dedicated safety evaluations in reproductive tissues are necessary to ensure that activation of AMPK in the ovary does not inadvertently disrupt normal ovarian physiology or compromise fertility.

• Complexity of PCOS Pathophysiology:
PCOS is a multifactorial syndrome that involves not only insulin resistance but also hyperandrogenism, aberrant steroidogenesis, and low‐grade chronic inflammation. Although restoring AMPK activity is expected to have beneficial impacts on both metabolic and steroidogenic pathways, comprehensive treatment of PCOS may require additional therapeutic measures. It is possible that A-769662, while effective in correcting insulin resistance at the cellular level, may need to be used in conjunction with other agents to fully address the heterogeneity of PCOS phenotypes (Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016).

Overall, A-769662 represents a promising candidate for repurposing to treat PCOS, particularly through its direct activation of AMPK in ovarian granulosa cells. Its mechanism—characterized by direct binding to the ADaM site, protection of Thr172 phosphorylation, and consequent activation of downstream metabolic pathways—is strongly aligned with the cellular defects documented in PCOS. The compound’s ability to enhance the PI3K/Akt pathway and promote GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake directly targets the key problem of insulin resistance in the ovary, with additional potential to normalize dysregulated steroidogenesis. Existing preclinical studies in metabolic tissues provide a solid foundation for its use, although specific studies in ovarian models are needed to confirm its applicability for PCOS. If such studies confirm the anticipated effects, A-769662 could be integrated into a broader therapeutic strategy aimed at addressing the multifaceted nature of PCOS by not only improving insulin sensitivity but also correcting aberrant hormone production.

In summary, the current data from multiple sources—ranging from mechanistic studies in non-ovarian tissues to emerging evidence of AMPK hypoactivity in PCOS granulosa cells—strongly support the hypothesis that direct allosteric activation of AMPK via A-769662 could restore critical metabolic and insulin signaling pathways in PCOS. This restoration would likely lead to enhanced PI3K/Akt phosphorylation, increased GLUT4 translocation, and ultimately improved insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in ovarian cells, thus addressing both metabolic dysfunction and associated reproductive abnormalities inherent in PCOS (Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016; Froment et al., 2022; Caplan, 2022; Chung et al., 2021; Treebak et al., 2009; Tarasiuk et al., 2022).

Looking forward, the development plan should include:
1. Detailed in vitro experiments using primary granulosa cells derived from PCOS patients to assess the effect of A-769662 on AMPK phosphorylation and activity; evaluation of the restoration of insulin signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway and measurement of GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake; and assessment of changes in steroidogenic enzyme expression and hormonal output (Dupont et al., 2012; Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016).
2. Comprehensive in vivo assessments in animal models that recapitulate both the metabolic and reproductive aspects of PCOS in order to determine tissue-specific efficacy and pharmacokinetics, as well as to monitor any potential off-target effects in reproductive tissues (Cool et al., 2006; Treebak et al., 2009).
3. Rigorous safety evaluation focusing on ovarian function, including analysis of estrous cycle regularity, oocyte quality, and hormone profiles, to ensure that A-769662 does not adversely affect normal reproductive processes (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
4. Potential combination therapy studies investigating the synergistic effects of A-769662 with established insulin sensitizers such as metformin, or with newer agents like myo-inositol, given that PCOS pathogenesis is multifactorial and may benefit from a multi-pronged treatment strategy (Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016).

In conclusion, while challenges remain—particularly regarding tissue-specific responses, isoform distribution, and potential off-target effects—the preclinical rationale for repurposing A-769662 to treat PCOS is robust. Its unique mechanism of directly activating AMPK holding promise for rebalancing both insulin signaling and steroid hormone production in PCOS-derived granulosa cells makes it a strong candidate for further investigation. With properly designed preclinical studies and careful evaluation of pharmacodynamics and safety in ovarian tissue, A-769662 could eventually progress to clinical trials and offer a novel, mechanism-based treatment for women suffering from PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cool et al., 2006; Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016; Treebak et al., 2009; Tarasiuk et al., 2022).

Overall, the repurposing of A-769662 for PCOS represents an innovative approach to a condition that has long lacked targeted, mechanism-based therapies. Its capacity to restore AMPK activation and thereby correct insulin resistance and abnormal steroidogenesis aligns closely with the current understanding of PCOS pathophysiology. The anticipated improvements in cellular metabolic profiles, reduction in hyperinsulinemia-driven androgen excess, and the overall enhancement of ovarian function could significantly advance treatment outcomes. Continued interdisciplinary research—integrating molecular biology, endocrinology, and pharmacology—will be essential to refine dosing parameters, optimize formulations, and ultimately translate these promising preclinical findings into effective clinical therapies for PCOS.

AdipoRon (Enzo Life Sciences catalog #BML-SA298),"Proposal for AdipoRon (Enzo Life Sciences catalog #BML-SA298)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
AdipoRon is a small‐molecule synthetic agonist of the adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 that was discovered through high‐throughput screening of compound libraries at the University of Tokyo. Its identification followed a rational, structure‐based drug discovery approach that leveraged the novel structural insights into adiponectin receptor architecture, specifically their unique seven‐transmembrane domain configuration with a zinc‐binding site distinct from that found in classic G protein‐coupled receptors (Okada‐Iwabu et al., 2015). As the first orally active adiponectin receptor activator, AdipoRon belongs to a class of compounds intended to mimic the properties of adiponectin, a hormone secreted by adipose tissue that is profoundly involved in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, and mitochondrial function. Its synthetic nature makes it significantly more druggable compared to the naturally occurring adiponectin protein, thus circumventing the challenges associated with administering large peptide hormones that possess poor stability and unfavorable pharmacokinetic profiles (Iwabu et al., 2015; Lee, 2020). This class of small‐molecule adiponectin receptor agonists has been broadly explored, initially for their anti‐diabetic, anti‐obesity, and cardiometabolic benefits, and their inherent oral bioavailability positions them as promising candidates for repurposing in several metabolic and inflammatory conditions.

Therapeutic History:
Historically, the development of AdipoRon has been driven by the unmet need to mimic the beneficial metabolic effects of adiponectin—namely, improved insulin sensitivity, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, and anti‐inflammatory actions—in a manner that is both practical and clinically relevant. Preclinical research, dating from its first description, has demonstrated that administration of AdipoRon in obese and diabetic rodent models leads to a marked improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, normalization of lipid profiles, and even lifespan extension in high‐fat diet‐induced obesity models (Okada‐Iwabu et al., 2015; Otvos, 2019). Moreover, its efficacy is not limited to metabolic endpoints; studies have also reported promising results in cardiovascular protection, as evidenced by its ability to attenuate postischemic myocardial apoptosis via AMPK‐mediated as well as AMPK‐independent pathways (Zhang et al., 2015). In oncology, emerging reports have evaluated AdipoRon’s antiproliferative and pro‐apoptotic effects across various cancer cell lines—including pancreatic, breast, ovarian, and osteosarcoma—with the aim of exploiting adiponectin receptor activation to counteract tumorigenesis (Nigro et al., 2021). Despite a rich history of investigation in metabolic and cancer models, to date there are no direct published studies detailing the use of AdipoRon in the context of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) specifically. Nonetheless, the pathophysiological basis of PCOS—characterized by insulin resistance, chronic low‐grade inflammation, and impaired metabolic signaling—shares several mechanistic commonalities with the conditions where AdipoRon has shown efficacy. In particular, reduced circulating adiponectin levels and impaired adiponectin receptor signaling have been implicated in the insulin resistance observed in PCOS patients (Iwabu et al., 2021; Kim & Park, 2019). Thus, while AdipoRon itself has not been directly tested in PCOS granulosa cells or in clinical PCOS populations, its well‐documented role in ameliorating insulin resistance and mitigating inflammation in other tissues supports a strong theoretical rationale for its repurposing in PCOS.

Mechanism of Action:
AdipoRon functions by binding directly to the adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, thereby acting as a receptor agonist that recapitulates the effects of its endogenous ligand, adiponectin. Upon binding, AdipoRon activates a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways that are central to metabolic regulation. Its actions include the phosphorylation and activation of AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the subsequent downstream activation of key metabolic regulators such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and the coactivator PGC‐1α. Activation of these pathways results in enhanced fatty acid oxidation, improved mitochondrial biogenesis, and overall better energy metabolism (Kim & Park, 2019; Okada‐Iwabu et al., 2019). Additionally, AdipoRon has been shown to increase intrinsic ceramidase activity within the cell, thereby promoting the conversion of pro‐apoptotic ceramides to sphingosine‐1 phosphate (S1P), which confers cytoprotective effects and further contributes to improved insulin sensitivity (Otvos, 2019).

At the molecular level, the binding of AdipoRon to the receptors induces a conformational change that favors the recruitment and activation of intracellular kinases. In skeletal muscle and hepatic cells, this leads to significant AMPK phosphorylation, which in turn facilitates the activation of downstream substrates responsible for promoting glucose uptake and enhancing insulin signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway (Iwabu et al., 2021; Kim & Park, 2019). The details of this receptor‐mediated activation underscore the compound’s ability to switch cellular metabolism from a lipogenic state to one favoring lipid oxidation and energy expenditure. Moreover, AdipoRon exhibits anti‐inflammatory properties by attenuating signaling pathways such as JNK and IKK, which are linked to the inflammatory cascade frequently upregulated in insulin‐resistant states (Nigro et al., 2021). This dual capacity to both enhance anabolic insulin signaling and suppress catabolic inflammatory responses is particularly relevant given the metabolic and inflammatory derangements observed in PCOS.

Furthermore, structural studies have reinforced that the molecular framework of AdipoRon, which includes a benzyl substituted piperidine moiety essential for receptor binding, is critical for its specificity towards adiponectin receptors. Although detailed synthetic procedures are complex and primarily described in medicinal chemistry literature, the key point is that the design of AdipoRon was guided by structure‐activity relationship (SAR) analyses aiming to optimize its binding affinity (Kd values of approximately 1.8 and 3.1 µM for AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, respectively) and its subsequent biological potency (Dib et al., 2017; Okada‐Iwabu et al., 2018). These mechanistic insights collectively suggest that AdipoRon’s effects result from a concerted activation of metabolic and anti‐inflammatory pathways, making it a multifunctional agent in the modulation of insulin sensitivity and cellular energy status.

Expected Effect in PCOS Granulosa Cells:
The hypothesis driving the repurposing of AdipoRon for PCOS is predicated on the well‐established observation that women with PCOS often exhibit reduced serum adiponectin levels and decreased adiponectin receptor activity, contributing to insulin resistance—a hallmark of the syndrome. In granulosa cells, which play a central role in folliculogenesis and ovarian steroidogenesis, insulin resistance is a key factor that disrupts normal ovarian function and contributes to the clinical manifestations of PCOS, including anovulation and hyperandrogenism (Iwabu et al., 2021; Kim & Park, 2019).

Administration of AdipoRon is expected to directly activate AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 on ovarian granulosa cells. This activation should trigger the phosphorylation of AMPK, leading to improved mitochondrial function and increased fatty acid oxidation, thereby ameliorating the lipotoxic environment often observed in PCOS ovaries (Okada‐Iwabu et al., 2019; Otvos, 2019). Moreover, by simultaneously engaging PPARα, AdipoRon would be anticipated to promote transcriptional programs that favor enhanced glucose uptake and lipid metabolism. The downstream activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, a critical mediator for insulin signaling, is expected to further drive glucose uptake into the granulosa cells, thus helping to restore normal cellular insulin responsiveness (Iwabu et al., 2021; Kim & Park, 2019).

From a mechanistic standpoint, the anti‐inflammatory properties of AdipoRon are of particular importance in the PCOS context. By suppressing the JNK and IKK signaling pathways, which are commonly upregulated in insulin‐resistant states and contribute to chronic low‐grade inflammation, AdipoRon is anticipated to reduce inflammatory cytokine production in granulosa cells. The reduction in inflammation is likely to alleviate the autocrine and paracrine disruption of insulin signaling in the ovary, thus supporting improved follicular development and reducing androgen excess. The net effect of these actions would be enhanced insulin sensitivity and improved metabolic activity within granulosa cells, which in turn could normalize ovarian function in PCOS patients (Kim & Park, 2019; Iwabu et al., 2015).

It is also relevant to note that the expected effects of AdipoRon are supported by extensive preclinical studies wherein its administration in animal models results in improved glucose homeostasis, enhanced insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and liver, and reduction of inflammatory markers (Lee, 2020; Nigro et al., 2021). While direct studies in ovarian granulosa cells are lacking, the conserved nature of adiponectin receptor signaling across multiple tissues lends credibility to the hypothesis that a similar mechanism is present in the ovary. Furthermore, the literature documents that AMPK activation is a crucial mediator in cells exhibiting insulin resistance, making the expected stimulation of the PI3K/Akt axis via AMPK activation by AdipoRon a plausible therapeutic strategy for PCOS (Kim & Park, 2019; Okada‐Iwabu et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, AdipoRon presents as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome based on several compelling factors. At a mechanistic level, its ability to activate adiponectin receptors and stimulate downstream signaling pathways—namely AMPK and PPARα—which are intimately involved in regulating insulin sensitivity and cellular metabolism, is directly relevant to the pathophysiology of PCOS. The compound’s dual anti‐diabetic and anti‐inflammatory actions address two of the core abnormalities observed in PCOS: insulin resistance and chronic low‐grade inflammation (Iwabu et al., 2015; Kim & Park, 2019).

Strengths of AdipoRon include its oral bioavailability and established safety profile in rodent models, which facilitate rapid preclinical development and potential clinical translation. Its synthetic nature confers several advantages over biologics; notably, it can be manufactured consistently at scale, and its molecular structure can be optimized through medicinal chemistry approaches to enhance potency, tissue specificity, or pharmacokinetic properties as needed (Lee, 2020; Otvos, 2019). Moreover, the well‐documented beneficial effects of AdipoRon in improving glucose uptake and reducing lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle, liver, and cardiac tissue provide a strong rationale for similar metabolic benefits in ovarian granulosa cells. Given that insulin resistance is a central driver of the endocrine and metabolic disturbances in PCOS, the restoration of proper insulin signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway may potentially correct dysfunctional steroidogenesis and follicular development.

On the other hand, there are notable challenges and weaknesses that must be considered. Despite a robust body of evidence supporting AdipoRon’s metabolic benefits in peripheral tissues, direct evidence for its efficacy in ovarian granulosa cells remains sparse. As PCOS is a heterogeneous disorder and ovarian tissue features unique regulatory mechanisms, it is critical to conduct dedicated in vitro studies in human granulosa cells to confirm that AdipoRon elicits the desired activation of AMPK and PPARα pathways while effectively suppressing JNK/IKK‐mediated inflammation and enhancing PI3K/Akt signaling (Nigro et al., 2021; Iwabu et al., 2021). Another consideration is the potential for variable dose‐dependent responses. As noted in other cell types, AdipoRon can exhibit a range of effects—from beneficial metabolic stimulation at lower doses to potential cellular toxicity or even pro‐apoptotic signaling at higher concentrations (Lee, 2020; Fairaq, 2017). Therefore, careful dose–response studies must be undertaken in ovarian models to determine the therapeutic window, ensuring that the beneficial insulin‐sensitizing and anti‐inflammatory effects can be harnessed without eliciting adverse effects.

Furthermore, while insulin resistance in PCOS has been frequently linked to reduced adiponectin levels and signaling, the exact expression and activity levels of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in PCOS granulosa cells need to be clearly characterized. Differential expression of these receptors may alter the overall response to agonist treatment, and it is possible that other signaling modulators present in the ovarian microenvironment could influence the efficacy of AdipoRon (Kim & Park, 2019; Okada‐Iwabu et al., 2019). It will thus be essential to corroborate the presence and functionality of these receptors in both in vitro and in vivo PCOS models.

In terms of clinical translation, the relatively extensive preclinical data from metabolic and cardiovascular studies in rodent models are encouraging. However, as with any repurposing strategy, there is a gap that must be bridged by demonstrating that the pathways modulated by AdipoRon in other tissues faithfully recapitulate in ovarian physiology in PCOS (Iwabu et al., 2021; Kim & Park, 2019). Because PCOS is a multifactorial disease with endocrine, metabolic, and reproductive components, a multifaceted study design incorporating both cellular assays in granulosa cells and animal models that display features of PCOS will be necessary to validate the therapeutic potential of AdipoRon.

Overall, taking into account its established mechanism of action, successful preclinical profile in related metabolic disorders, and the biological rationale linking impaired adiponectin signaling to insulin resistance in PCOS, AdipoRon emerges as a promising candidate for therapeutic repurposing. Its strengths lie in its ability to simultaneously target multiple dysregulated pathways—enhancing AMPK–mediated insulin sensitivity, activating PPARα for improved lipid metabolism, and suppressing inflammatory signaling cascades—that are central to the pathology of PCOS. Nevertheless, targeted studies must confirm its efficacy and safety in ovarian tissue, and careful calibration of dosages will be required to prevent potential adverse effects. Given these considerations, advancing AdipoRon into proof‐of‐concept experiments in PCOS‐relevant cellular systems and animal models is justified and could potentially open a new avenue for treating the metabolic and reproductive disturbances that characterize PCOS (Okada‐Iwabu et al., 2015; Nigro et al., 2021).

In conclusion, while further targeted research is needed to establish direct effects in PCOS ovarian cells, the comprehensive literature supports the potential for AdipoRon to restore impaired adiponectin receptor signaling and improve insulin sensitivity, suggesting it could be an innovative therapeutic candidate for PCOS treatment.

SRT1720 (Cayman Chemical catalog #10009164),"Proposal for SRT1720 (Cayman Chemical catalog #10009164)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SRT1720 is a synthetic small‐molecule activator of SIRT1 that was originally discovered through structure–activity relationship studies aimed at identifying compounds more potent than the natural activator resveratrol. SRT1720 belongs to the class of SIRT1 activators, a subset of small molecules known to modulate a NAD⁺‐dependent deacetylase critical for cellular metabolism, stress responses, and longevity. Synthetic in origin, SRT1720 has been chemically optimized to possess high cell permeability and increased potency, achieving an EC₁.₅ of 0.16 µM and a maximum activation value in the range of several hundred percentage points (Milne et al., 2007, pp. 1–2). This compound has been well characterized in preclinical settings for its broad metabolic benefits with favorable ADME profiles, and it exists as part of a broader therapeutic strategy aimed at rebalancing metabolic and inflammatory pathways. Historically, compounds of this chemical class have been used primarily in metabolic disorder models to mimic the benefits of caloric restriction. SRT1720 in particular has been studied in rodent models of type 2 diabetes and obesity, suggesting promising effects on insulin sensitivity and systemic inflammation (Milne et al., 2007, pp. 2–4; Lu et al., 2023, pp. 10–11).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of SRT1720 is rooted in its preclinical development as an agent for type 2 diabetes and obesity. In these studies, SRT1720 was demonstrated to improve insulin sensitivity, lower fasting blood glucose, and enhance mitochondrial function in metabolic tissues such as liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. In male db/db mice—a genetic model of type 2 diabetes—oral administration of SRT1720 reduced hyperinsulinemia and improved hepatic insulin sensitivity, while in female high‐fat diet–induced obese mice it preserved ovarian reserve by activating SIRT1 signaling and suppressing mTOR pathways (Lu et al., 2023, pp. 10–11). Despite its robust preclinical evaluation in metabolic disease models, searches within clinical trial registries have not revealed active trials specifically addressing SRT1720 or similar SIRT1 activators in the context of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, while there is considerable overlap in the underlying metabolic dysregulation between type 2 diabetes and PCOS—particularly regarding insulin resistance—the use of SRT1720 specifically for PCOS remains unexplored in human studies. However, evidence from related studies using agents that activate SIRT1 in ovarian contexts (including studies on metformin and natural SIRT1 activators such as resveratrol) offers a mechanistic rationale for repurposing SRT1720 for PCOS (Lu et al., 2023, pp. 6–7; Li et al., 2023, pp. 6–8).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of SRT1720 is well characterized at a molecular level and principally involves the allosteric activation of SIRT1—a NAD⁺-dependent deacetylase that plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolic regulation. SRT1720 binds to an allosteric site on the SIRT1 enzyme, which is exposed when SIRT1 is complexed with acetylated peptide substrates. The binding of SRT1720 to this allosteric region reduces the Michaelis constant (Kₘ) for the acetylated substrates without affecting the Kₘ for NAD⁺, thereby enhancing the catalytic efficiency of SIRT1 (Milne et al., 2007, pp. 2–5). Once activated, SIRT1 deacetylates numerous downstream targets that are central to metabolic regulation. One particularly important target in the context of PCOS is LKB1, a serine-threonine kinase that, upon deacetylation, becomes activated and in turn phosphorylates and activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK functions as a master energy sensor that regulates not only cellular energy balance but also modulates the activity of pathways critical to insulin signaling—most notably, it can inhibit serine kinases such as JNK that are known to phosphorylate IRS-1 on serine residues. This inhibition of IRS-1 serine phosphorylation is critical for sustaining the insulin receptor’s downstream signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which in turn promotes the translocation of GLUT4 and enhances glucose uptake (Lu et al., 2023, pp. 12–13; Li et al., 2023, pp. 2–4). In addition, SIRT1 activation has been associated with improved mitochondrial function as it promotes the deacetylation of PGC-1α—a transcriptional coactivator that enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism (Milne et al., 2007, pp. 1–2; Minor et al., 2011, pp. 1–2). The multifaceted action of SRT1720, therefore, spans the regulation of cellular energy homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and reduction of systemic inflammation. In ovarian theca cells derived from PCOS patients, which are known to exhibit both insulin resistance and aberrant steroidogenesis, SRT1720 is anticipated to restore metabolic balance by activating the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK axis and consequently enhancing IRS-1/PI3K/Akt signaling (Tao et al., 2019, pp. 1–2; Lu et al., 2023, p. 16).

Expected Effect:
Based on the established mechanism of action, the proposed assay hypothesizes that treatment of PCOS-derived theca cells with SRT1720 will lead to an increased deacetylation of LKB1 due to the enhanced activity of SIRT1. This deacetylated LKB1 is then expected to activate AMPK, thereby amplifying AMPK signaling. An increase in AMPK activity is known to suppress stress kinases such as JNK, which are implicated in the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Consequently, a reduction in IRS-1 serine phosphorylation will relieve the inhibition imposed on the insulin receptor signaling complex. This will promote enhanced activation of downstream effectors in the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is critical for promoting glucose uptake through the mobilization of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (Li et al., 2023, pp. 6–8; Lu et al., 2023, p. 16). Given that insulin resistance in ovarian theca cells is a well-recognized contributor to the pathogenesis of PCOS, improvement in insulin receptor signaling is expected to restore normal glucose uptake and possibly ameliorate hyperandrogenism associated with these cells. In support of this, studies have shown that SIRT1 expression in ovarian cells is linked to improved mitochondrial function, oxidative stress reduction, and normalized steroidogenesis (Li et al., 2023, pp. 12–13; Lu et al., 2023, pp. 7–8). Thus, the administration of SRT1720 would not only correct insulin resistance via the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt signaling cascade but also enhance overall metabolic health of the theca cells, with potential implications for restoring normal ovarian function in PCOS patients.

Overall Evaluation:
SRT1720 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of PCOS, particularly given its potent activation of SIRT1 and the extensive preclinical evidence supporting the role of SIRT1 in modulating key metabolic pathways. One of the major strengths of this approach is the mechanistic specificity provided by SRT1720. By directly targeting the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK axis, SRT1720 offers a novel mode of action that diverges from conventional insulin-sensitizing agents while still converging on the critical downstream PI3K/Akt pathway essential for glucose uptake. Its ability to enhance mitochondrial function further contributes to its appeal, as mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a central component in the pathophysiology of PCOS (Milne et al., 2007, pp. 1–2; Lu et al., 2023, pp. 10–11). Moreover, the favorable ADME properties and in vivo efficacy in animal models of metabolic diseases underscore SRT1720’s potential for rapid translation into ovarian cell assays and subsequent preclinical studies specific to PCOS (Minor et al., 2011, pp. 1–2).

However, there are several weaknesses and limitations to consider. First, despite the robust preclinical data in models of type 2 diabetes and obesity, there is a conspicuous absence of direct clinical or preclinical studies involving PCOS or ovarian tissues. As a result, the exact efficacy and safety profile of SRT1720 in the specific context of PCOS remain to be determined. The complexity of PCOS—which involves not only insulin resistance but also hormonal imbalances and direct ovarian dysfunction—may present challenges that are not fully captured by metabolic models alone. Additionally, while the hypothesized mechanism is compelling, the translation of these cellular effects into meaningful clinical outcomes in women with PCOS will require rigorous evaluation in both in vitro systems using PCOS-derived theca cells and in vivo animal models that recapitulate the multifactorial aspects of the disorder (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Lu et al., 2023, pp. 16–17).

Furthermore, previous studies with SRT1720 have predominantly focused on its metabolic effects, leaving some questions about potential off-target effects, long-term toxicity, and its impact on other aspects of ovarian physiology unanswered. While the activation of SIRT1 generally confers anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing benefits, a comprehensive assessment of potential hormonal side effects and interactions with other signaling pathways in ovarian tissues is necessary before advancing to clinical trials. In comparison with current standard treatments such as metformin, which has an established albeit off-label use in PCOS, SRT1720 would need to demonstrate clear benefits over existing therapies in terms of efficacy, safety, and quality of life improvements (Tao et al., 2019, pp. 1–2; Lu et al., 2023, pp. 6–7).

In summary, SRT1720 is a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of PCOS due to its potent and specific activation of SIRT1, its validated mechanism of enhancing the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK axis, and the resultant improvements in insulin signaling observed in other metabolic tissues. Its ability to deacetylate LKB1, alleviate inhibitory serine phosphorylation on IRS-1, and boost downstream PI3K/Akt-dependent glucose uptake aligns well with the underlying pathophysiology of insulin resistance in PCOS-derived ovarian theca cells. Despite the strengths, the candidate still requires further preclinical evidence in ovarian-specific models to validate both its efficacy and safety in treating PCOS. The lack of direct clinical data in PCOS represents a critical gap that our research team should address in upcoming in vitro and in vivo studies. Overall, while SRT1720 shows considerable promise as a novel therapeutic approach to correct metabolic defects in PCOS, its successful repurposing will depend on additional focused research on its actions in ovarian tissue and careful assessment of its long-term effects (Lu et al., 2023, pp. 16–17; Li et al., 2023, pp. 6–8; Milne et al., 2007, pp. 1–2).

TDZD-8 (4-benzyl-2-thiozolyl-5-thiazolidinone; Sigma-Aldrich catalog #597072),"Proposal for TDZD-8 (4-benzyl-2-thiozolyl-5-thiazolidinone; Sigma-Aldrich catalog #597072)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
TDZD-8 (4‐benzyl-2-thiozolyl-5-thiazolidinone) is a synthetically derived, small-molecule inhibitor that belongs to the thiazolidinone class, a family of heterocyclic compounds characterized by a five‐membered ring containing both sulfur and nitrogen. This candidate was initially developed via multi‐step organic synthesis involving the formation of a thiadiazolidinone core through oxidative cyclization of thiobiuret intermediates and subsequent alkylation steps that introduce critical substituents—a benzyl group at one position and a thiozolyl moiety at another—to stabilize the heterocyclic structure and confer selectivity toward glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) (Castro et al., 2008). TDZD-8 is a non-ATP competitive inhibitor, meaning that instead of competing with ATP for binding to the kinase’s highly conserved ATP pocket, it binds to an alternative allosteric site, thereby stabilizing the inactive conformation of GSK3β; this mechanism offers higher selectivity and reduces off-target effects, a crucial advantage over classic ATP-competitive inhibitors (Kakraba et al., 2023). As a synthetic compound, TDZD-8 represents a refined product of targeted medicinal chemistry that emerged from efforts to identify small molecules capable of modulating key cellular pathways through kinase inhibition. Thiazolidinone derivatives have been explored in various preclinical contexts, including neurodegenerative disorders, certain cancers, and metabolic diseases, due to their ability to modulate aberrant kinase signaling, and TDZD-8 adds to this growing portfolio with a focus on modulating insulin signaling via GSK3β inhibition (Nasim et al., 2011).

Therapeutic History
Historically, thiazolidinone derivatives such as TDZD-8 have been predominantly utilized in preclinical studies aimed at investigating the regulation of GSK3β activity—a kinase implicated in a diverse range of pathological states including neurodegeneration, cancer, and metabolic syndromes. Preclinical evidence has shown that TDZD-8 can induce rapid cellular responses such as swift cell death in acute myelogenous leukemia models and modulate oxidative pathways in cellular systems, which underscores its potent biological activity (Nasim et al., 2011). In metabolic studies, there is compelling evidence indicating that inhibition of GSK3β with compounds like TDZD-8 leads to improved insulin sensitivity and enhanced glucose tolerance in rodent models; partial suppression of GSK3β activity (roughly 30–40%) is sufficient to induce favorable metabolic outcomes without triggering off-target proliferative effects (Martínez, 2008). Although direct studies using TDZD-8 in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) models are currently lacking and clinical trials specifically addressing its use in PCOS have not been registered (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), significant genetic and biochemical findings support the idea that GSK3β is a viable target in PCOS pathology (Ochoa et al., 2023). In addition, thiazolidinone derivatives have a track record of being repurposed for varying metabolic and inflammatory conditions in preclinical settings, suggesting a broad therapeutic history from which further investigations in PCOS could be extrapolated (Hu et al., 2013).

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, TDZD-8 operates as a selective, non-ATP competitive inhibitor of GSK3β. Rather than binding to the kinase’s ATP-binding site, TDZD-8 associates with an allosteric hydrophobic pocket present in the inactive conformation of GSK3β, thereby stabilizing this nonfunctional form and preventing the enzyme from phosphorylating its substrates (Castro et al., 2008). One of the critical substrates of GSK3β is insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), which, under conditions of excessive kinase activity, becomes aberrantly phosphorylated on serine residues; this abnormal phosphorylation impairs downstream signaling initiated by insulin receptor activation. By inhibiting GSK3β, TDZD-8 is proposed to prevent this excessive serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, thereby restoring the proper function of the insulin receptor and enhancing the signaling cascade that involves phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt (Lv et al., 2020). The PI3K/Akt pathway is directly connected to the regulation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation, which is crucial for glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues. Moreover, GSK3β is involved in the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of β-catenin, a key regulator of cell adhesion and transcription—its stabilization is beneficial in maintaining cellular homeostasis and promoting granulosa cell function in the ovary (Castro et al., 2008). These molecular interactions form the biochemical basis for TDZD-8’s therapeutic potential by linking GSK3β inhibition to improved insulin signaling, enhanced GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake, and favorable alterations in β-catenin stability—the three major nodes implicated in the metabolic dysregulation observed in PCOS (Kakraba et al., 2023).

Expected Effect
In the context of PCOS, the ovarian granulosa cells are notably affected by impaired insulin signaling, characterized by defective IRS-1 function, suboptimal activation of PI3K/Akt, and a reduction in GLUT4 translocation—each contributing to the observed insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction within the ovary (Lv et al., 2020). The hypothesis for using TDZD-8 in PCOS is that its inhibition of GSK3β will prevent the abnormal serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, thereby restoring its normal function and allowing the insulin receptor to successfully propagate downstream signaling. This restoration would lead to increased phosphorylation of Akt, which is imperative for promoting GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane, thereby enhancing glucose uptake in an insulin-dependent manner (Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016). Additionally, GSK3β inhibition should concurrently stabilize β-catenin, a factor that contributes to the proper proliferation and differentiation of granulosa cells, which are central to normal follicular development and ovulatory processes in the ovary (Kong et al., 2017). Preclinical studies in other metabolic tissues have shown that partial inhibition of GSK3β can ameliorate features of insulin resistance and improve overall metabolic homeostasis, providing a strong rationale that similar improvements could be achieved in the ovarian microenvironment of women with PCOS (Martínez, 2008). Hence, the expected effect of TDZD-8 treatment in PCOS would be to enhance insulin receptor signaling, boost GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake, and improve both metabolic and reproductive parameters by restoring a more physiologic state in ovarian granulosa cells (Castro et al., 2008).

Overall Evaluation
TDZD-8 represents a compelling and scientifically sound candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent in PCOS owing to its targeted mechanism of inhibiting GSK3β—a kinase that mediates critical aspects of insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction in ovarian granulosa cells (Ochoa et al., 2023). One of the fundamental strengths of TDZD-8 is its non-ATP competitive mode of inhibition, which enables high selectivity for GSK3β while minimizing the off-target activity generally associated with ATP-competitive inhibitors. This specificity is critical in minimizing adverse effects, particularly in a chronic condition like PCOS, where long-term dosing is likely required (Castro et al., 2008). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that compounds of this class can improve insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in various experimental models, providing a robust rationale that similar mechanisms could be harnessed in the ovarian context to alleviate PCOS’s metabolic derangements (Lv et al., 2020; Castro et al., 2008).

Another notable strength is the well-defined biochemical target; GSK3β has been genetically and functionally linked to PCOS, with high-scoring genetic association data reinforcing its role in the disease pathology (Ochoa et al., 2023). The anticipated benefits of TDZD-8—increased IRS-1 function, enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling, improved GLUT4 translocation, and stabilized β-catenin—are supported by a body of preclinical evidence in other tissue types, including rodent models of insulin resistance, lending credibility to its potential efficacy in ovarian granulosa cells (Lv et al., 2020; Castro et al., 2008).

However, there are several notable weaknesses and challenges to be addressed upon further consideration. First, despite the strong mechanistic rationale and encouraging preclinical data from other systems, there exists a significant gap in clinical trial data specifically evaluating TDZD-8 in PCOS; to date, no studies on its effects in the ovarian microenvironment or directly in PCOS patients have been registered (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This lack of data raises uncertainties regarding its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles in women with PCOS, particularly given the unique hormonal and metabolic context of their ovarian tissue (Castro et al., 2008).

Furthermore, GSK3β plays multifaceted roles in cellular physiology, contributing not only to insulin signaling but also to the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis through β-catenin modulation. Comprehensive inhibition of GSK3β in ovarian granulosa cells could potentially disturb the finely tuned balance required for normal folliculogenesis and ovarian function. Therefore, while partial inhibition of GSK3β is beneficial in improving insulin sensitivity, it will be imperative to determine the optimal dosing of TDZD-8 that restores normal signaling without adversely affecting granulosa cell viability or function (Martínez, 2008; Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016).

Another consideration is the possibility of compensatory signaling pathways being activated in response to chronic GSK3β inhibition. Given the extensive involvement of GSK3β in multiple intracellular pathways, cells may adapt over time by upregulating alternate pathways that could reduce the long-term efficacy of TDZD-8. Such compensatory mechanisms might ultimately diminish the therapeutic benefits in PCOS and require combination approaches or periodic dosing adjustments to maintain efficacy (Nasim et al., 2011).

Despite these challenges, the strengths of TDZD-8 remain notable. Its molecular mechanism aligns directly with the underlying defects in insulin signaling observed in PCOS granulosa cells, and the preclinical evidence from models of insulin resistance suggests that even moderate, controlled inhibition of GSK3β can yield substantial improvements in metabolic function (Lv et al., 2020). Additionally, the chemical properties of TDZD-8, including its selectivity and rapid engagement with its target, have been well-documented in other fields such as oncology and neurodegeneration studies, which, although not directly related to PCOS, provide reassurance regarding its potency and safety in long-term use under controlled conditions (Nasim et al., 2011; Kakraba et al., 2023).

From a translational perspective, the genetic evidence linking GSK3β to PCOS enhances the rationale for exploring TDZD-8 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate. The data from genome-wide association studies and integrative platforms not only underscore the involvement of GSK3β in the disease but also support the notion that restoring its appropriate regulation may reverse many of the metabolic and reproductive abnormalities observed in PCOS (Ochoa et al., 2023). Moreover, improvements in insulin sensitivity mediated by GSK3β inhibitors in rodent and in vitro studies suggest that a similar pharmacological strategy could be effective in ameliorating the insulin resistance that is central to PCOS pathophysiology (Martínez, 2008).

Nonetheless, additional research is clearly required to define the effects of TDZD-8 in ovarian granulosa cells specifically. Future studies should focus on validating that TDZD-8 normalizes IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, enhances Akt activation, increases GLUT4 translocation, and ultimately improves glucose uptake in these cells. Such studies must be complemented by in vivo experiments using established animal models of PCOS to evaluate both metabolic endpoints and reproductive outcomes, including follicular development and ovulation rates (Lv et al., 2020; Castro et al., 2008; Al Neyadi et al., 2024).

In summary, TDZD-8 holds significant promise as a repurposed drug candidate for PCOS due to its targeted, non-ATP competitive inhibition of GSK3β—a key player implicated in the aberrant insulin signaling and metabolic dysregulation observed in the ovarian microenvironment of PCOS patients. Its mechanism of action, which is expected to reverse maladaptive IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, stabilize β-catenin, and restore PI3K/Akt signaling with consequent improvements in GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake, offers a strong biochemical rationale for its potential benefit (Castro et al., 2008; Lv et al., 2020). While the robust preclinical data in related models and the favorable safety profile seen in prolonged animal studies form the key strengths of TDZD-8, the absence of direct clinical evidence in PCOS and the possibility of compensatory cellular responses highlight the need for additional in-depth studies prior to clinical translation (Martínez, 2008; Nasim et al., 2011). Overall, given the genetic association of GSK3β with PCOS and the clear mechanistic pathway through which TDZD-8 can improve insulin receptor function in ovarian granulosa cells, advancing this candidate into focused preclinical studies on PCOS seems both scientifically justified and promising (Al Neyadi et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In conclusion, TDZD-8 exemplifies an innovative approach to addressing a critical unmet need in PCOS management—the restoration of normal insulin signaling within ovarian tissue. Its selective, non-ATP competitive inhibition of GSK3β is particularly appealing, as it circumvents many of the pitfalls of broader kinase inhibitors and directly targets the molecular defects known to contribute to PCOS pathology. The combination of robust genetic insights, preclinical positive data on insulin sensitivity, and a sound mechanistic basis provides a compelling case for further exploration of TDZD-8 in the context of PCOS. Future research should prioritize the establishment of reliable in vitro and in vivo models to examine the compound’s effects on ovarian granulosa cells and overall reproductive function, carefully optimizing dosing strategies and evaluating any potential off-target effects on ovarian physiology. With these additional studies, TDZD-8 has the potential to be advanced into early-phase clinical trials, ultimately offering a novel therapeutic strategy for improving metabolic and reproductive outcomes in women suffering from PCOS (Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016; Kong et al., 2017).

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of SC79 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), assembled from multiple lines of evidence in the biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature provided.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SC79 is a fully synthetic, small-molecule compound that emerged from high-throughput cell–based screening efforts aimed at identifying modulators of Akt activity. Its discovery was serendipitous when researchers sought compounds that interfered with the normal translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane. Instead of acting as an inhibitor, SC79 was found to bind directly to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt; this binding induces a favorable conformational change that promotes its membrane translocation and, consequently, its phosphorylation at key regulatory residues (Thr308 and Ser473). SC79 is classified within the family of allosteric kinase activators—an emerging class of therapeutic compounds that activate kinase enzymes by binding sites distinct from the ATP binding pocket. Unlike traditional inhibitors that compete at the catalytic site, these allosteric agents are designed to “rescue” or potentiate the activity of enzymes when upstream signaling is compromised. This strategy is particularly important in scenarios where defects in receptor signaling or activation of intermediary molecules (such as IRS-1 or PI3K) reduce the natural activation of Akt. The synthetic origins of SC79, along with its relatively straightforward chemical structure (as evidenced by its catalog availability from Sigma-Aldrich, S7944), make it an attractive candidate for repurposing. Preclinical studies have previously leveraged compounds of this class to restore or enhance Akt activity in contexts where Akt-dependent pathways are downregulated, such as in ischemia-induced neuronal injury and cardiomyocyte survival models (Jo et al., 2012; Jing et al., 2019). This class has also proven beneficial in models where downstream components must be activated directly because of defects in upstream insulin receptor signaling—a condition highly relevant to the pathophysiology of PCOS.

Therapeutic History:
SC79 has been studied almost exclusively in preclinical and experimental models rather than in clinical settings. The initial studies focusing on SC79 examined its role in protecting neuronal cells from ischemia-induced death by promoting robust Akt phosphorylation, which translated to increased cell survival and reduced apoptosis in models of stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage. In addition to neuroprotective effects, SC79 has been investigated in hepatocyte models, where it effectively protected liver cells from TNF-α-mediated apoptosis and mitigated liver injury in Gal/LPS-induced models (Jing et al., 2019). With respect to its broader classification as an Akt activator, similar molecules have been investigated for their ability to bypass defects in upstream insulin signaling. Under conditions where the insulin receptor or insulin receptor substrate (IRS) encounters functional defects, the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade becomes compromised. In disorders such as PCOS, numerous studies have demonstrated that the loss or impairment of IRS-1 phosphorylation—and consequently, decreased PI3K activation—leads to attenuated Akt signaling in relevant tissues including skeletal muscle and ovarian cells (Baptiste et al., 2010; Chakrabarty & Nagamani, 2008). Although SC79 has not been directly tested in ovarian or theca cells derived from PCOS patients, its preclinical history in other cell types and disease models provides compelling indirect evidence for its repurposing. For instance, in models where defective upstream signaling was observed, direct activation of Akt was capable of rescuing downstream metabolic and pro-survival pathways (Nitulescu et al., 2018). No reports have emerged that SC79 or similar allosteric Akt activators have been used clinically in PCOS, making this a novel application; however, the extensive research into insulin resistance and consequent metabolic dysfunction—both central aspects of PCOS—supports further investigation into this approach (Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016; McIlvenna, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
Under normal physiological conditions, Akt activation is a multi-step process triggered downstream of ligand engagement of insulin and growth factor receptors. Once the receptors are activated, they recruit and phosphorylate IRS proteins that in turn activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K catalyzes the generation of the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), which then binds to the PH domain of Akt. This binding induces a conformational change in Akt that allows it to localize to the plasma membrane. At the membrane, Akt becomes phosphorylated at two key residues: Thr308 by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and Ser473 by the mTORC2 complex, leading to its full activation (Chakrabarty & Nagamani, 2008).
SC79 circumvents the need for PIP3 generation by directly binding to the PH domain of Akt. This allosteric binding mimics the conformational change that typically would be induced by PIP3 and favors Akt’s translocation and subsequent phosphorylation. Importantly, SC79 has been shown to activate all three Akt isoforms in a pan-specific manner, meaning that it can enhance the activity of Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3. This pan-isoform activity is particularly relevant given that Akt2 is known to play a significant role in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in insulin-responsive tissues, and its activity is crucial in the ovarian context (Nitulescu et al., 2018; Jo et al., 2012). Activation of Akt by SC79 leads to the phosphorylation of downstream targets such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), which is normally inhibited once phosphorylated, and modulation of transcription factors like FOXO that are integral for cell survival and metabolic regulation (Jing et al., 2019).
PCOS is frequently characterized by defective IRS-1 phosphorylation and impaired PI3K activation, resulting in diminished endogenous Akt phosphorylation. By directly binding to and activating Akt, SC79 could theoretically bypass these defects, ensuring that downstream events—including GLUT4 translocation—proceed effectively. This would lead to improved glucose uptake, enhanced cell survival, and potentially normalized steroidogenesis in ovarian cells (Chakrabarty & Nagamani, 2008; Baptiste et al., 2010). The capacity of SC79 to “rescue” Akt signaling even when upstream signals are compromised is a noteworthy feature that has been underscored in studies involving neurons and hepatocytes, and it serves as a central pillar in the hypothesis for its use in PCOS (Jo et al., 2012; Nitulescu et al., 2018).

Expected Effect:
In the pathophysiology of PCOS, ovarian theca cells are known to exhibit insulin resistance that is partly due to impaired signaling at the level of IRS-1 and PI3K, culminating in reduced Akt phosphorylation. This defect contributes not only to metabolic dysfunction but is also implicated in abnormal steroidogenesis and hyperandrogenemia. As such, when ovarian theca cells become resistant to insulin, downstream events such as GLUT4 translocation are blunted, resulting in reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and potentially exacerbating hyperinsulinemia. The working hypothesis is that SC79 will allosterically activate Akt in PCOS-derived theca cells regardless of deficient upstream signals. Through its direct binding to the Akt PH domain, SC79 is expected to robustly stimulate Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473, acting independently of the impaired IRS-1/PI3K pathway.
With Akt activated, several beneficial downstream effects are anticipated. First, phosphorylation of Akt leads to the inactivation of GSK-3β, which would normally inhibit glycogen synthesis; its inactivation promotes glycogen storage and improves overall glucose metabolism. Second, the activation of Akt is known to initiate the phosphorylation of various substrates that facilitate GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. In tissues such as skeletal muscle and adipocytes, this effect is critical for enhancing glucose uptake in response to insulin, and similar mechanisms are proposed in ovarian cells. Indeed, several studies have documented that defective Akt signaling in ovarian tissues correlates with decreased GLUT4 expression or translocation, contributing to insulin resistance (Liu et al., 2024; McIlvenna, 2021).
Moreover, enhanced Akt signaling may influence the balance of steroidogenesis. The ovarian theca cells in PCOS are known to overproduce androgens as a result of aberrant insulin signaling, and by restoring proper Akt activity, it is conceivable that abnormal androgen biosynthesis could be modulated. The normalization of Akt activity might diminish the hyperactivation of enzymes involved in androgen synthesis or correct the aberrant response to luteinizing hormone (LH) that is frequently observed in PCOS (Baptiste et al., 2010; Chakrabarty & Nagamani, 2008).
Additionally, by promoting the proper translocation of GLUT4 and improving glucose uptake, SC79 could reduce compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Elevated insulin levels are known to exacerbate ovarian dysfunction and hyperandrogenism; hence, a reduction in insulin secretion due to enhanced insulin sensitivity could confer systemic metabolic benefits. Although direct evidence of SC79’s action in ovarian theca cells is yet to be generated, studies in other cell models clearly indicate that SC79 is capable of robustly activating Akt and eliciting downstream effects that are analogous to those needed in PCOS cells (Qiu et al., 2020; Tong et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
SC79 holds considerable promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for PCOS based on its unique mechanism of direct Akt activation and its ability to bypass upstream defects. One of the principal strengths of SC79 is its well-documented ability to bind the PH domain of Akt and promote phosphorylation at key regulatory sites, an effect that has been rigorously demonstrated in neuronal and hepatocyte models (Jo et al., 2012; Jing et al., 2019). This mechanism is particularly attractive for PCOS, in which the insulin signaling cascade is disrupted at the level of IRS-1 and PI3K, leading to deficient Akt activation. Direct activation of Akt by SC79 could restore crucial downstream processes—most notably, GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake—even in the presence of upstream impairments. This outcome could potentially alleviate the characteristic hyperinsulinemia observed in many PCOS patients, thereby reducing its contributory effects on hyperandrogenemia and abnormal ovarian steroidogenesis (Chakrabarty & Nagamani, 2008; Baptiste et al., 2010).

The cell-permeable nature of SC79 further enhances its appeal because successful delivery into target cells is a key requirement for any candidate drug. Additionally, preclinical safety data from studies in other organ systems suggest that there exists a favorable therapeutic window for SC79 administration; these safety findings, while derived from neuronal and hepatic models, provide an initial indication that the compound could be well tolerated in vivo (Jo et al., 2012; Guan et al., 2023).

Despite these strengths, several uncertainties and potential weaknesses remain. One major challenge is the paucity of direct evidence for SC79’s effectiveness in ovarian or theca cells derived from PCOS patients. The ovarian environment in PCOS is highly complex—characterized not only by insulin resistance but also by hyperandrogenism, altered paracrine signaling among granulosa and theca cells, and abnormal extracellular matrix remodeling. Therefore, while the robust activation of Akt by SC79 in other tissues is promising, it is uncertain whether similar effects will translate seamlessly in the ovary (Liu et al., 2024; McIlvenna, 2021). Moreover, ovarian cells express a network of phosphatases and other regulatory proteins (such as PTEN) that might counterbalance the effects of sustained Akt activation. It is critical to determine whether the chronic activation of Akt could disrupt the delicate balance between cell survival and apoptosis, ultimately leading to unintended consequences such as abnormal folliculogenesis or increased risk of ovarian hyperplasia. Some studies have underscored that even when downstream nodes like Akt are activated, additional factors—such as elevated levels of inhibitory phosphatases—may modulate the final cellular response (Bellanger et al., 2014; Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016).

Another potential challenge relates to the specificity of SC79 in the complex microenvironment of the ovary. Although SC79 is reported to act as a pan-Akt activator, different Akt isoforms play distinct roles in various tissues. Akt2, for instance, is closely linked to glucose uptake in metabolic tissues and is expected to be beneficial when activated, whereas Akt1 and Akt3 may have divergent roles in cellular proliferation and survival. The indiscriminate activation of all isoforms might lead to off-target effects not anticipated in the simpler systems studied so far (Nitulescu et al., 2018). It will be essential to evaluate whether SC79’s activation profile in ovarian cells recapitulates the beneficial outcomes observed in cardiomyocytes or neurons without inadvertently promoting pathological proliferation or other adverse alterations.

Furthermore, the ovarian cells in PCOS are subject to multiple overlapping defects—not only in insulin signaling but also in inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Agents such as metformin and pioglitazone have been used clinically in PCOS with modest success, acting both on insulin sensitivity and indirectly on ovarian steroidogenesis (Baptiste et al., 2010; Wang & Li, 2023). The notion of combining SC79 with existing insulin sensitizers may be attractive if SC79 alone cannot fully restore the normal cellular phenotypes due to these additional layers of dysregulation. It may be necessary to use SC79 synergistically with other compounds to achieve the desired metabolic and endocrine improvements in PCOS (Qiu et al., 2020; Tong et al., 2022).

From a developmental perspective, the chemical simplicity and availability of SC79 (via commercial sources such as Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #S7944) are significant advantages. The ability to quickly procure and test this molecule in cellular and animal models of PCOS could accelerate the timeline for determining its efficacy and safety in this context. However, extensive preclinical studies specifically focused on ovarian cell types—ideally using cells derived from PCOS patients as well as relevant animal models that mimic the human disease—will be imperative to validate whether SC79’s direct Akt activation translates into improved GLUT4 translocation, normalized androgen production, and overall amelioration of PCOS metabolic abnormalities (Chakrabarty & Nagamani, 2008; Guan et al., 2023).

In summary, SC79 represents a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of PCOS due to its novel mechanism of directly activating Akt. By bypassing the common upstream defects in insulin receptor signaling—specifically the impaired phosphorylation of IRS-1 and subsequent PI3K activation—SC79 is expected to restore downstream metabolic processes critical for normal ovarian function. Its action is supported by extensive work in neuronal and hepatic models, where SC79 robustly promotes Akt phosphorylation, enhances cell survival, and improves metabolic outcomes. The anticipated effect in ovarian theca cells, namely the promotion of GLUT4 translocation and subsequent improvement in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, directly addresses a core defect in the pathogenesis of PCOS (Chakrabarty & Nagamani, 2008; Baptiste et al., 2010).

Nevertheless, significant challenges remain. The current body of evidence lacks direct evaluation of SC79 in ovarian cells, and it is uncertain whether its robust activation of Akt observed in other tissues can be faithfully replicated in the unique microenvironment of the PCOS ovary. The potential for off-target effects, given the pan-Akt activation profile and the complex interplay of regulatory molecules in ovarian tissue, necessitates careful dose optimization and mechanistic studies. Additionally, the multifactorial nature of PCOS—with contributions from androgen excess, inflammation, and aberrant paracrine signaling—means that restoration of Akt activity alone might not be sufficient to fully normalize ovarian function. Combination approaches, where SC79 is used alongside established insulin sensitizers, could potentially offer additive or synergistic benefits (Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016; McIlvenna, 2021).

Overall, while further experimental validation in PCOS-derived ovarian theca cells and appropriate in vivo models is imperative, SC79 stands out as a conceptually innovative approach to overcome a central defect in PCOS. Its ability to activate Akt downstream of impaired insulin receptor function, coupled with prior evidence of safety and efficacy in non-ovarian tissues, provides a strong rationale for its further development. Should subsequent studies confirm that SC79 can indeed promote GLUT4 translocation, improve insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and normalize androgen production in PCOS cells, it would represent a significant advancement in addressing the metabolic and endocrine dysregulation inherent in this syndrome (Jo et al., 2012; Nitulescu et al., 2018; Wang & Li, 2023).

In conclusion, based on the current literature, SC79 is a highly promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for PCOS. Its unique mechanism of allosteric Akt activation offers a targeted means to bypass defective upstream signaling evident in PCOS, with the potential to improve insulin sensitivity and correct associated metabolic abnormalities. Moving forward, detailed preclinical studies specifically in ovarian cell models are required to fully delineate its benefits and possible limitations. If these studies yield positive results, SC79 may well add a valuable new option in the treatment arsenal for PCOS, addressing key aspects of the syndrome that remain insufficiently managed by existing therapies.

MCC950 (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #SML0952),"Proposal for MCC950 (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #SML0952)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MCC950 is a small‐molecule inhibitor originally discovered through extensive screening for its ability to block NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Chemically, it belongs to the diarylsulfonylurea class of compounds, a group known for developing molecules with high selectivity and potency in modulating immune–inflammatory pathways. Its synthesis was reported in detail in early studies that established its potent inhibitory effect on NLRP3, a cytosolic sensor that regulates the production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and IL-18. MCC950 was identified by screening for molecules that specifically inhibit inflammasome assembly rather than interfering non-selectively with upstream signals. As a synthetic molecule, its structure was optimized to improve its solubility and bioavailability; indeed, its sodium salt formulation offers high water solubility that makes it suitable for both in vitro and in vivo studies. The compound has been widely used as a research tool to elucidate NLRP3 biology in various inflammatory disease models, and its chemical properties place it in a novel therapeutic class that targets intracellular inflammatory pathways. This approach is distinct from biologic agents that neutralize cytokines after their secretion, as MCC950 acts upstream by directly blocking inflammasome formation (Coll et al., 2015).

Therapeutic History:
MCC950 has been extensively evaluated in preclinical models of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Biochemically, it has demonstrated potent inhibition of both the canonical and non-canonical pathways of NLRP3 activation, reducing IL-1β secretion in mouse bone marrow–derived macrophages, human monocyte-derived macrophages, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In animal models, MCC950 has shown efficacy in conditions such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis—a model for multiple sclerosis—as well as in murine models of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), where it rescued neonatal lethality by attenuating excessive inflammasome activity. Additionally, MCC950 has been proven effective in mouse models of spontaneous colitis and salt-sensitive hypertension, where its administration led to decreased systemic inflammatory cytokines and improved disease outcomes. However, to date there is no record of MCC950 being directly utilized for the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) or related ovarian disorders. Its extensive preclinical validation in other inflammasome-driven disease models gives strong mechanistic plausibility for its repurposing in PCOS; yet, while similar inflammatory pathways are implicated in PCOS pathogenesis—such as chronic low-grade inflammation mediated by IL-1β and IL-18—direct application in PCOS remains to be established. There is thus an opportunity for translational research to assess MCC950 in granulosa cell models of PCOS given the pre-existing preclinical safety and pharmacokinetic data in other inflammatory conditions (Perera et al., 2018; Coll et al., 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of MCC950 is well defined at the molecular level. It acts specifically on the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding directly to the NACHT domain, particularly targeting the Walker B motif. This interaction inhibits ATP hydrolysis, a critical energy-dependent step required for the conformational change and oligomerization necessary for inflammasome assembly. By preventing the formation of the active NLRP3 complex, MCC950 stops the downstream recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC and the subsequent activation of caspase-1. This cascade is essential for the proteolytic processing of the immature cytokine precursors pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature, secreted forms. Importantly, studies have demonstrated that MCC950 specifically reduces IL-1β and IL-18 secretion without interfering with other inflammasomes such as NLRC4, AIM2, or NLRP1, or affecting upstream Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. It neither affects potassium or calcium flux, nor does it disrupt the direct interactions between NLRP3 and ASC in a general manner, which underscores its specificity (Coll et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2020). Additional investigations suggest that MCC950’s binding does not perturb the priming phase of NLRP3 upregulation, but rather acts solely at the level of inflammasome assembly, which is a critical distinction compared with broader anti-inflammatory agents. Its effects on ASC oligomerization and caspase-1-mediated pyroptotic cell death have been observed consistently in cellular assays, further underlining its potential utility as an anti-inflammatory agent. The degree of inhibition consistently correlates with decreased IL-1β secretion in various cell types, and the compound has demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range, making its pharmacodynamic profile highly attractive for therapeutic intervention (Coll et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2020).

Expected Effect in PCOS:
PCOS is characterized by a constellation of features including hyperandrogenism, chronic low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance (IR), and granulosa cell dysfunction. Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18 have been implicated in the development of ovarian insulin resistance through their ability to activate stress kinases—for example, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway—which leads to serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). This serine phosphorylation impedes the proper transmission of insulin signals through the PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby inhibiting GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane and contributing to systemic and local insulin resistance. The central hypothesis is that by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome in ovarian granulosa cells, MCC950 will reduce the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, which in turn is expected to lower JNK-mediated IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. With a reduction in these inflammatory mediators, insulin receptor signaling through PI3K/Akt could be restored, thereby promoting proper GLUT4 translocation and insulin sensitivity. Granulosa cells express components of the inflammasome and are known to be negatively affected by chronic inflammatory signaling, leading to impaired steroidogenesis and follicle maturation. Although direct data in granulosa cells from PCOS patients is not available in the current literature, the well-documented role of NLRP3-mediated cytokine production in other cell types supports the potential translation to ovarian tissue. Moreover, the preclinical evidence demonstrating MCC950’s capacity to restore normal cytokine profiles in models of inflammatory disease provides a strong rationale that its use in PCOS could mitigate the pathological cascade linking inflammasome activation, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance (Moustakli et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025; Coll et al., 2015).

Overall Evaluation:
The repurposing of MCC950 for PCOS presents a promising translational opportunity based on several compelling factors. First, the high specificity of MCC950 for the NLRP3 inflammasome offers a mechanistic advantage over less selective anti-inflammatory compounds. By targeting a critical upstream node in the inflammatory cascade, it has the potential to reduce both IL-1β and IL-18 secretion and thereby attenuate downstream effects that lead to JNK activation and insulin resistance. This is particularly relevant in PCOS, where chronic inflammation is believed to drive ovarian dysfunction and metabolic disturbances. Second, the preclinical safety and favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile observed in animal models instill further confidence in its potential clinical utility. MCC950 has already demonstrated good oral bioavailability, metabolic stability, and a lack of significant off-target effects, which are essential parameters in drug development. Moreover, its successful application in diverse inflammatory disease models—ranging from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and CAPS to colitis and hypertension—underscores its versatility as an anti-inflammatory agent (Coll et al., 2015; Perera et al., 2018; Krishnan et al., 2019).

However, several challenges remain. To date, MCC950 has not been directly evaluated in models of PCOS or in ovarian granulosa cells. This gap necessitates rigorous in vitro studies using primary granulosa cells from PCOS patients or relevant animal models of PCOS to verify that the molecular mechanisms observed in macrophages or other inflammatory models translate to ovarian tissue. Additionally, while the inhibition of NLRP3 results in reduced cytokine secretion, it is essential to confirm that this biochemical effect indeed leads to improved insulin receptor signaling at the cellular level. Detailed studies assessing downstream markers such as JNK activation, IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, PI3K/Akt pathway restoration, and GLUT4 translocation in granulosa cells are required before clinical translation. It is also important to consider that immune suppression in other contexts can create risks, such as increased susceptibility to infections; however, MCC950’s short half-life compared to biologics offers some control over such potential adverse events (Schwaid & Spencer, 2020; Wu et al., 2020).

Another strength of MCC950 lies in its mode of action, which is distinct from existing cytokine-neutralizing biologics. Current therapeutics in inflammation, like IL-1β inhibitors (anakinra, canakinumab), have shown efficacy in diseases such as CAPS but may leave IL-18-mediated pathways unchecked and are often associated with prolonged immunosuppression. MCC950, by directly preventing inflammasome assembly, offers the possibility of a more complete blockade of the pro-inflammatory cascade while allowing for a rapid withdrawal of its effects due to its shorter half-life. This characteristic is of particular interest when considering applications in metabolic diseases where fine-tuning of the inflammatory response is necessary to avoid unintended consequences on immune competence (Coll et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2020).

From a drug development perspective, the existing preclinical data on MCC950’s safety and PK profile in mouse models bolster its candidacy for repurposing in PCOS. Its high metabolic stability in liver microsomes of both human and mouse origin indicates a favorable ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) profile. Furthermore, the documented low risk of cytochrome P450-mediated drug–drug interactions suggests that MCC950 could be co-administered with other therapies commonly employed in PCOS without major concerns regarding metabolic liabilities (Coll et al., 2015; Agarwal et al., 2020).

In terms of the pathophysiological rationale for PCOS, there is a growing body of evidence implicating chronic inflammation in the disruption of insulin signaling in ovarian cells. This is mediated, in part, by inflammasome-derived cytokines that promote stress kinase activation and subsequent inhibitory modifications on insulin receptor substrates. By dampening the source of these cytokines, MCC950’s mechanism of action is well aligned with the therapeutic goal of restoring normal insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt signaling in granulosa cells, which could in turn ameliorate the insulin resistance commonly observed in PCOS patients. This mechanistic hypothesis is strengthened by parallel evidence in the literature linking reduced inflammasome activity with improved insulin sensitivity in other contexts (Yang et al., 2025; Lu et al., 2023).

Nonetheless, there are caveats that must be addressed. The absence of direct evidence for MCC950’s efficacy in PCOS models remains a significant gap. Preclinical studies specifically tailored to the ovarian microenvironment, along with clinical biomarker studies in PCOS patients, will be crucial to validate the hypothesis. Additionally, while the selective inhibition of NLRP3 is an advantage, it must be noted that inflammasomes play important roles in host defense; hence, systemic inhibition might carry risks if not properly localized or timed. Strategies to achieve ovarian-specific delivery or dosing regimens that minimize systemic immunosuppression could be beneficial.

Overall, the thorough biochemical characterization and demonstrated anti-inflammatory efficacy of MCC950 across multiple disease models offer strong support for its potential repurposing in PCOS. Its ability to directly inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome could address the underlying inflammatory drivers of insulin resistance in ovarian granulosa cells, thereby restoring normal insulin receptor signaling and improving metabolic as well as reproductive functions. The strengths of MCC950 include its high potency, selective mechanism of action, favorable preclinical PK and safety profiles, and a mechanistic approach that targets an upstream nodal point in the inflammatory pathway. However, the lack of direct evidence in PCOS models and the inherent challenges associated with systemic inflammasome inhibition represent key areas that require further investigation. In conclusion, while promising, the translation of MCC950 for treating PCOS will require dedicated studies focusing on granulosa cell function, insulin signaling, and in vivo efficacy in PCOS-specific animal models before advancing to clinical trials (Coll et al., 2015; Perera et al., 2018; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020).

SP600125 (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #S5567),"Proposal for SP600125 (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #S5567)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SP600125 is a synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor that was discovered through high‐throughput biochemical screening intended to identify compounds that inhibit c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity by targeting its ATP‐binding site. It belongs to the anthrapyrazolone class of compounds, a subclass of synthetic small molecules characterized by their planar structure and nitrogen-containing moieties that enable ATP-competitive inhibition of kinases. This compound was initially synthesized by modifications of anthraquinone structures to yield a molecule with specific inhibitory activity against JNK isoforms (Bennett et al., 2001). The anthrapyrazolone class has, over time, been widely used as research tools to dissect JNK-dependent signaling pathways in various cell types. In preclinical contexts these compounds have demonstrated the ability to inhibit stress-induced signaling cascades, modulating inflammatory responses and apoptosis, which are mechanisms relevant both in metabolic dysfunction and in ovarian pathophysiology (Bennett et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, SP600125 has been used extensively as a pharmacological tool in cell culture and animal models to elucidate the roles of JNK in inflammation, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. Preclinical applications have included studies in models of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory lung disease, and even in cancer models as a mechanism to modulate abnormal cellular proliferation (Bennett et al., 2001; Bildik et al., 2018). Despite its widespread use in preclinical research, no clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov have directly evaluated SP600125 or related JNK inhibitors for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In the ovarian context, SP600125 has been employed in preclinical studies to assess the role of JNK signaling in granulosa cell function and ovarian inflammation, for example in studies investigating lysyl oxidase regulation in PCOS models where IL-1β induced LOX expression is partially blocked by SP600125 in granulosa cells (Zhang et al., 2018). However, evidence of its use in directly targeting theca cells or modulating insulin resistance mechanisms in PCOS is limited to preclinical reports demonstrating that JNK inhibition can improve ovarian morphology and hormone regulation when combined with insulin sensitizers like metformin and pioglitazone (Wu et al., 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
SP600125 acts as a reversible, ATP-competitive inhibitor of JNK isoforms (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3). At the molecular level, it binds to the conserved ATP-binding pocket of JNK, thereby preventing phosphorylation of downstream targets such as c-Jun, a component of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex (Bennett et al., 2001). This inhibition leads to a decreased transcription of genes that are normally induced by JNK activation, including pro-inflammatory cytokines and certain mediators of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Notably, JNK is known to phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) on serine residues, which, when hyperphosphorylated, impairs insulin receptor signaling by reducing the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation events essential for PI3K/Akt pathway activation (Lewis et al., 2003; Tuncman et al., 2006). Thus, SP600125 by inhibiting JNK activity is expected to reduce IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, restore its tyrosine phosphorylation, and subsequently improve downstream insulin signaling. In various cell types such as adipocytes and hepatocytes, such an approach has shown promise in restoring insulin sensitivity, and this pharmacological action provides the rationale for targeting ovarian theca cells in PCOS where JNK-driven insulin resistance is implicated (Solinas & Becattini, 2017; Wu et al., 2018).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underlying the proposed use of SP600125 in PCOS is that JNK-mediated serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 underlies insulin resistance in ovarian theca cells, a critical component in the altered steroidogenesis and hyperinsulinemia observed in PCOS. By administering SP600125, one expects to inhibit JNK activity in theca cells, thereby preventing aberrant IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. This mechanistic intervention should restore the normal tyrosine phosphorylation events on IRS-1, facilitating proper activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade. Enhanced PI3K/Akt activity would lead to improved insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and metabolic function within the ovary, potentially ameliorating both insulin resistance and the associated hyperandrogenism characteristic of PCOS (Wu et al., 2018; Lewis et al., 2003). Furthermore, studies in rodent PCOS models have demonstrated that combining the JNK inhibitor with metformin and pioglitazone enhances ovarian follicular development and reduces pathological ovarian features, supporting the potential benefit of supplementing standard insulin-sensitizing therapies with direct JNK inhibition (Wu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). Although direct data in theca cells are sparse, related work in granulosa cells suggests that SP600125 has a measurable impact on key ovarian signaling pathways involved in inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling—pathways that are also tied to insulin signaling (Zhang et al., 2018).

Overall Evaluation:
SP600125 appears to offer a promising mechanism-based approach for the treatment of PCOS by directly targeting JNK, a critical kinase implicated in the disruption of insulin signaling via IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. Among its strengths are its well-characterized biochemical action, its reversible ATP-competitive inhibition of JNK, and its demonstrated ability to modulate inflammatory and stress-related signaling pathways in various cell types and animal models (Bennett et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2018). The literature supports that JNK inhibition can restore insulin signaling in metabolic tissues, and preclinical data in ovarian models suggest that similar benefits may extend to the impaired insulin responsiveness observed in PCOS (Lewis et al., 2003; Solinas & Becattini, 2017). Furthermore, SP600125’s use in research involving ovarian granulosa cells bolsters the rationale for its application in modulating ovarian function, potentially addressing both insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism through improved PI3K/Akt signaling (Zhang et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018).

However, several weaknesses and uncertainties temper the enthusiasm for repurposing SP600125 as a therapeutic for PCOS. First, there is a notable lack of direct clinical or preclinical evidence specifically in the ovarian theca cell context, as most studies have focused on granulosa cells or more systemic metabolic models. While the mechanistic rationale is sound, validation in PCOS-specific models, particularly those examining the impact on IRS-1 phosphorylation in theca cells and subsequent regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, remains limited (Wu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). Second, potential off-target effects have been observed with SP600125 at higher concentrations; transcriptomic analyses indicate that SP600125 can modulate a broad range of genes beyond its intended target, raising concerns about cellular toxicity and non-specific effects (El Atifi & Champelovier, 2010). Moreover, while rodent studies suggest a tolerable safety profile, systemic effects such as those demonstrated in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion models caution that careful dose optimization and safety profiling will be necessary (Lee et al., 2006). Finally, the absence of any registered clinical trials for SP600125 in PCOS or related insulin resistance conditions indicates that significant translational and regulatory hurdles remain before it can be considered a viable therapeutic candidate (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In summary, SP600125 provides a compelling pharmacological tool based on an attractive hypothesis: by inhibiting JNK in ovarian theca cells, it may alleviate insulin resistance through the restoration of proper IRS-1 signaling and consequent activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which in turn could improve ovarian function in PCOS. Its strengths lie in its defined mechanism of action and demonstrated preclinical activity in related pathways, while its weaknesses relate to the need for further validation in PCOS-specific models, concerns regarding off-target and safety profiles, and the current lack of clinical data. Overall, while SP600125 holds promise for repurposing in PCOS treatment, further targeted studies—both in vitro (particularly in theca cells) and in relevant in vivo PCOS models—are essential to establish its therapeutic efficacy and safety before advancing to clinical trials (Wu et al., 2018; Bennett et al., 2001; Lewis et al., 2003).

Salubrinal (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #SML0343),"Proposal for Salubrinal (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #SML0343)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Salubrinal is a synthetic small molecule originally identified through chemical screening efforts designed to modulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. It was discovered as an inhibitor of the protein phosphatase complexes responsible for dephosphorylating the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), thereby enabling sustained phosphorylation of eIF2α and maintaining the adaptive arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR). As a member of the small molecule ER stress modulators, Salubrinal belongs to a pharmacological class that generally aims to reduce the burden of misfolded proteins in the ER by attenuating global protein translation. This class of compounds has been extensively used in preclinical studies to provide cellular protection in conditions characterized by excessive ER stress, such as neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and certain models of ovarian dysfunction. The compound is commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #SML0343) and has been characterized both biochemically and using molecular docking models that demonstrate its interaction with key residues in the PP1/GADD34 complex (Harada et al., 2021; Zadorozhnii et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Salubrinal has been applied predominantly in preclinical settings. In cellular models, it has shown promise as a protective agent against ER stress–induced apoptosis in neuronal cells and models of neurodegenerative diseases, where sustained eIF2α phosphorylation delays cell death. Preclinical studies in rodent models have further demonstrated that Salubrinal can reverse obesity-associated ovarian dysfunction, improving oocyte developmental competence and restoring mitochondrial function (Harada et al., 2021). Outside of reproductive biology, its ability to modulate ER stress has been explored in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other conditions featuring misfolded protein accumulation (Vieira et al., 2024). However, despite the mechanistic promise and extensive research on ER stress in metabolic and endocrine diseases, Salubrinal itself has not yet been directly evaluated in clinical trials for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Searches of clinical trial databases for “Salubrinal OR eIF2α OR ER stress AND Polycystic Ovary Syndrome” reveal studies examining ER stress markers in PCOS and the use of insulin sensitizers (e.g., metformin and myo-inositol) but do not indicate any direct investigation of Salubrinal in this setting (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hernández Mijares, 2013; Rocha Barajas, 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Salubrinal exerts its effects by selectively inhibiting eIF2α phosphatases, primarily those associated with the regulatory subunit GADD34 in complex with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). By preventing dephosphorylation of eIF2α, Salubrinal sustains the phosphorylated state of this key translation initiation factor. Under conditions of ER stress, phosphorylation of eIF2α acts as a braking mechanism on global protein synthesis, thereby reducing the influx of nascent proteins into the ER and giving the cell time to restore proteostasis. This prolonged adaptive response facilitates the selective translation of stress-responsive genes such as ATF4, which orchestrates downstream cytoprotective pathways. Moreover, by maintaining eIF2α phosphorylation, Salubrinal indirectly contributes to a reduction in the activation of stress kinases such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which have been implicated in mediating insulin resistance through inhibitory serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates in various cell types (Harada et al., 2021; Vieira et al., 2024). Additionally, preclinical studies have demonstrated that reducing ER stress via sustained eIF2α phosphorylation can positively influence insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. For instance, experiments in a GALT-deficient mouse model showcased that Salubrinal treatment restored diminished PI3K/Akt signaling, a pathway critically linked to insulin sensitivity (Balakrishnan et al., 2017). These molecular interactions are supported by computational studies showing stable binding of Salubrinal to active sites within eIF2α phosphatase complexes (Zadorozhnii et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
In the context of PCOS, granulosa cells often exhibit ER stress and dysregulated UPR, which are thought to contribute to insulin resistance and impaired ovarian function. The central hypothesis under evaluation is that Salubrinal, by inhibiting eIF2α phosphatase activity, will help sustain adaptive UPR signaling in these cells. By sustaining eIF2α phosphorylation, Salubrinal is expected to lower the accumulation of misfolded proteins, thereby reducing the activation of pro-apoptotic stress signals, including JNK. Reduction in JNK activation is significant because JNK has been implicated in the pathological suppression of insulin receptor signaling through serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates, leading to insulin resistance. Consequently, improved insulin receptor signaling should enhance PI3K/Akt pathway activation, which is vital for glucose uptake and metabolic regulation in granulosa cells (Harada et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2020). Since insulin signaling plays an important role in follicular development and ovulation, restoring this pathway is anticipated to ameliorate some of the reproductive and metabolic dysfunctions associated with PCOS (Harada et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2020). Moreover, granulosa cell studies have repeatedly shown that the expression of key UPR components and stress kinases is altered in PCOS, suggesting that molecules modulating these pathways could have a direct physiological impact (Jin et al., 2020; Takahashi et al., 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
Salubrinal presents a compelling mechanistic rationale as a drug candidate for repurposing in the treatment of PCOS based on its capacity to modulate ER stress—a pathway increasingly understood to contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. One of the major strengths of Salubrinal lies in its targeted mechanism of action: by selectively inhibiting eIF2α phosphatase activity, it prolongs eIF2α phosphorylation and supports an adaptive rather than apoptotic UPR. This approach not only reduces the burden of misfolded proteins but also limits the activation of stress kinases, such as JNK, that are known to impair insulin receptor signaling. Given that insulin resistance is a central feature of PCOS, particularly within ovarian granulosa cells, enhancing the PI3K/Akt pathway via reduction of ER stress could improve glucose uptake and overall metabolic outcomes (Harada et al., 2021; Balakrishnan et al., 2017).

However, several weaknesses and outstanding challenges remain. Although preclinical studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of Salubrinal in models of obesity-associated ovarian dysfunction and other ER stress–related conditions, there is as yet no direct clinical or preclinical evidence specifically in PCOS models. Clinical trials in PCOS have focused on insulin sensitizers like metformin rather than on direct ER stress modulators, and the literature does not record any studies in which Salubrinal has been administered to women with PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hernández Mijares, 2013; Rocha Barajas, 2020). Additionally, while sustained phosphorylation of eIF2α is generally protective under moderate stress, chronic inhibition of dephosphorylation might have deleterious effects on cellular homeostasis if the balance shifts too far from the normal transient responses of the UPR. Off-target effects, potential toxicity, and pharmacokinetic challenges such as solubility and bioavailability also remain significant hurdles in translating Salubrinal from bench to bedside. The evidence from other disease models, including the reversal of aberrant PI3K/Akt signaling in a GALT-deficient mouse, is promising but not directly translatable to the complex molecular environment of PCOS (Balakrishnan et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2020). Finally, while the compound demonstrates favorable in vitro potency and specificity in its known mechanism, the lack of clinical studies specifically addressing its use for PCOS means that the true therapeutic benefit and safety profile in the intended population remain to be established.

In conclusion, Salubrinal’s mechanism of sustaining adaptive UPR through inhibition of eIF2α dephosphorylation, coupled with its potential to reduce stress-induced JNK activation and improve insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt signaling, places it among promising candidates for repurposing in PCOS. Its demonstrated efficacy in reducing ER stress in various cellular and animal models supports the hypothesis that it could ameliorate the insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction observed in PCOS granulosa cells. However, the absence of direct evidence in PCOS models and the potential for off-target effects underscore the need for further preclinical studies before advancing to clinical trials. Overall, while Salubrinal shows attractive mechanistic promise as a drug candidate for PCOS, rigorous validation in relevant ovarian cell models and animal studies is necessary to ensure its efficacy and safety in this new therapeutic context (Harada et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2020; Balakrishnan et al., 2017).

Celastrol (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #C0869),"Proposal for Celastrol (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #C0869)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Celastrol is a naturally occurring quinone methide triterpenoid isolated from the root extracts of Tripterygium wilfordii, commonly known as the Thunder God Vine, which belongs to the Celastraceae family. The compound is obtained primarily by extraction using organic solvents, with subsequent purification through chromatographic techniques, rather than via total chemical synthesis due to its structurally complex pentacyclic framework and the presence of a reactive quinone methide moiety (Allison et al., 2006; Brinker et al., 2007). Being a member of the pentacyclic triterpenoid class, celastrol has been central to traditional Chinese medicine for centuries, primarily used for its potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. In modern research, this class of natural triterpenoids has also been associated with multiple biological activities, including anticancer, neuroprotective, antioxidant, and metabolic regulatory effects, which have been documented in numerous preclinical studies (Cascão et al., 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The compound is available commercially, for instance under Sigma-Aldrich catalog number C0869, which has accelerated in-depth pharmacological research exploring its repurposing potential for diseases beyond its traditional applications, including metabolic disorders and now potentially Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).

Therapeutic History
Celastrol has garnered substantial attention due to its diverse pharmacological profile, with extensive investigations in models of metabolic dysfunction, obesity, and cancer. In rodent models of obesity and metabolic syndrome, celastrol has been shown to improve leptin sensitivity, induce weight loss, and alleviate insulin resistance through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities (Chan et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2021). Moreover, its anticancer properties have been demonstrated in various experimental models, where its ability to interfere with cellular chaperone functions, particularly targeting the Hsp90 machinery, has resulted in the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of tumor growth (Hernandes et al., 2017). Although celastrol has not been extensively investigated in clinical trials specifically addressing PCOS, there is a growing body of preclinical literature suggesting that its beneficial modulation of inflammatory and metabolic pathways may have utility in diseases that share common pathogenic mechanisms with PCOS, such as insulin resistance and chronic low-grade inflammation. Studies in experimental models of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and even certain autoimmune conditions have cumulatively provided mechanistic and functional insights that support its potential repositioning to treat endocrine disorders like PCOS (Chen et al., 2018; Hernandes et al., 2017; Kannaiyan et al., 2011). Thus, while direct clinical usage in PCOS remains to be extensively validated, the accumulated evidence from related metabolic and inflammatory models provides a compelling rationale to consider celastrol for this indication.

Mechanism of Action
Celastrol operates via a multifaceted mechanism that targets several key signaling pathways at the molecular level. One primary molecular event triggered by celastrol is the activation of Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1). HSF1 is a transcription factor that, upon activation, induces the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). These chaperone proteins mediate cellular proteostasis by facilitating proper protein folding and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins under stress conditions. The activation of HSF1 by celastrol not only provides cytoprotection but also contributes to the attenuation of cellular stress responses that are elevated in metabolic conditions (Chan et al., 2024). Concurrently, celastrol is a potent inhibitor of the nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway. NFκB is crucial for the transcription of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and plays a central role in mediating chronic inflammation. By blocking the activation of NFκB, celastrol reduces the production and secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and interleukins, thereby diminishing the inflammatory milieu that is commonly present in conditions like metabolic syndrome and PCOS (Chen et al., 2018).

Another critical aspect of celastrol’s mechanism involves its regulation of insulin signaling pathways. In states of insulin resistance, stress-activated kinases such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) are often hyperactivated, leading to serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). This aberrant phosphorylation interferes with the downstream signaling cascade normally initiated by IRS-1, thereby impairing the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream effector protein kinase B (Akt). Celastrol has been reported to inhibit JNK activity, which in turn preserves the functional integrity of IRS-1. This preservation facilitates the reactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to enhanced translocation of the glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane and improvement in glucose uptake by cells. This mechanism is fundamentally important for reversing insulin resistance, a core metabolic abnormality observed in PCOS (Xu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022).

Beyond these primary pathways, celastrol’s unique chemical structure confers additional biochemical properties. The presence of the quinone methide moiety enables celastrol to form covalent Michael adducts with reactive cysteine residues on proteins, thereby modulating the activity of a range of intracellular signaling proteins and enzymes. This mode of action further amplifies its anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects by disrupting aberrant protein–protein interactions and signaling cascades (Ng et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2019). In summary, celastrol targets multiple molecular nodes critical to the regulation of inflammation and insulin sensitivity, thereby offering a mechanistic platform that could be advantageous in treating PCOS, in which both chronic inflammation and insulin resistance play significant roles.

Expected Effect in PCOS Theca Cells
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is characterized by a constellation of endocrine, reproductive, and metabolic dysfunctions, with a pronounced role for insulin resistance and chronic inflammation in its pathogenesis. In the specific setting of ovarian theca cells, which contribute substantially to androgen production, celastrol is hypothesized to exert dual beneficial effects. First, by activating HSF1, celastrol is expected to elevate the production of heat shock proteins, reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress and enhancing cellular proteostasis (Chan et al., 2024). Theca cells in PCOS are often under considerable metabolic and inflammatory stress, conditions that exacerbate dysregulated steroidogenesis. The upregulation of HSPs could diminish such stress, thereby restoring more normalized cellular function and mitigating aberrant hormone synthesis.

Second, the inhibitory effect of celastrol on the NFκB signaling pathway carries significant implications for local inflammatory processes within the ovary. PCOS is often associated with a pro-inflammatory ovarian microenvironment due to elevated levels of cytokines like TNF-α, which not only promote insulin resistance but also influence the androgen biosynthetic machinery in theca cells. Suppression of NFκB signaling by celastrol is anticipated to reduce the production of these inflammatory mediators (Chen et al., 2018).

In parallel, inhibition of JNK activity by celastrol addresses a key molecular abnormality in insulin-resistant tissues. In PCOS, overactivation of JNK leads to inhibitory serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, thereby suppressing downstream signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway. Celastrol’s ability to inhibit JNK can restore proper IRS-1 function. With improved IRS-1 signaling, the cascade leading to Akt activation is strengthened, promoting the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane and augmenting glucose uptake by cells. Enhanced insulin signaling in ovarian theca cells could feasibly reduce hyperinsulinemia-driven androgen production, given that insulin resistance is closely linked to the endocrine imbalances observed in PCOS (Xu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022).

Collectively, in the context of PCOS, the expected cellular outcome of celastrol treatment in theca cells includes:
  • A reduction in inflammatory cytokine production due to NFκB suppression.
  • Decreased JNK activity leading to less inhibitory phosphorylation of IRS-1.
  • Enhanced activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade with increased GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake.
  • Improved cellular proteostasis via upregulation of heat shock proteins.
These coordinated effects are anticipated to translate into clinical benefits such as lowered androgen synthesis, improved insulin sensitivity, and overall normalization of the ovarian microenvironment. Such outcomes could ameliorate both the reproductive and metabolic disturbances typical of PCOS (Liu et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation
Celastrol represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for PCOS based on its robust anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties. The dual mechanism of action—activation of HSF1 and inhibition of NFκB—directly addresses critical components of PCOS pathophysiology: cellular stress and chronic inflammation. The compound’s inhibitory effect on JNK-mediated IRS-1 serine phosphorylation further supports its potential for restoring insulin signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby promoting GLUT4 translocation and improved glucose uptake (Xu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022).

One of the major strengths of celastrol as a therapeutic candidate for PCOS lies in its extensive preclinical validation in models of metabolic syndrome and obesity, conditions that share significant pathophysiological overlap with PCOS. Preclinical studies have convincingly demonstrated that celastrol can reduce leptin resistance, modulate lipid metabolism, and decrease inflammatory markers in rodent models, suggesting that similar mechanisms may be exploited in ovarian tissues. Furthermore, its documented capacity to modulate multiple intracellular pathways relevant to both inflammatory and metabolic dysfunction renders the compound uniquely suited to address the multifactorial nature of PCOS (Chan et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2021).

However, several challenges must be carefully weighed when considering celastrol for clinical application in PCOS. Celastrol is associated with a narrow therapeutic window and exhibits dose-dependent toxicity, including hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and potential reproductive toxicity, as has been observed in several preclinical studies (Wu et al., 2016; Li et al., 2022). These toxicological concerns necessitate precise dosing strategies and sufficient safety profiling, particularly in the context of a chronic condition such as PCOS where long-term administration may be required.

Moreover, celastrol’s poor water solubility and limited oral bioavailability have historically hindered its clinical development. Advances in drug delivery systems, including the development of nanoformulations such as lipid nanospheres, liposomes, and polymeric nanoparticles, have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by improving tissue targeting, enhancing systemic exposure, and reducing off-target side effects (Zhan et al., 2020; Pace et al., 2021). However, further work is needed to validate these formulations specifically in the context of reproductive disorders such as PCOS.

Another weakness is the relative paucity of direct evidence from ovarian cell models or clinical studies that explicitly test celastrol’s efficacy in PCOS patients. Most of the supporting data are derived from models of general insulin resistance, obesity, or cancer, necessitating focused studies on primary ovarian theca cells or PCOS-specific animal models to confirm whether the promising anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects translate effectively to the ovarian microenvironment (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chen et al., 2018).

Despite these challenges, the mechanistic rationale for celastrol’s application in PCOS is solid, based on its ability to modulate key signaling nodes that are aberrantly activated in this syndrome. The proposed hypotheses—that celastrol activation of HSF1 and suppression of NFκB in theca cells will reduce inflammatory cytokine production, lower JNK-mediated IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, and enhance PI3K/Akt-mediated GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake—are well rooted in the existing literature from metabolic and inflammatory disease models. In ovarian theca cells, where insulin signaling deficits contribute to hyperandrogenism and ovarian dysfunction, the reestablishment of normal signaling cascades through the dual action of celastrol could help restore endocrine balance (Liu et al., 2024; Peng et al., 2019).

Overall, celastrol possesses significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic agent for PCOS. Its strengths include a well-characterized mechanism of action with dual anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects, strong preclinical support in models of metabolic syndrome, and emerging approaches to improve its drug delivery and safety profile. Nonetheless, the limitations of narrow therapeutic margins, inherent toxicity issues, and limited direct evidence in PCOS-specific models underscore the need for dedicated preclinical investigations. Future studies should focus on validating its efficacy in ovarian tissue models, optimizing nanoformulation strategies for enhanced bioavailability, and rigorously examining its safety profile in long-term administrations relevant to PCOS management (Ng et al., 2019; Li et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2024; Peng et al., 2019).

In conclusion, with a focused research agenda that includes detailed biochemical studies in PCOS-relevant cells and carefully controlled animal models, celastrol could emerge as a compelling option for addressing the unmet clinical needs in PCOS by dual targeting of crucial inflammatory and metabolic pathways. The integration of advanced formulation technologies may further mitigate its toxicity and improve patient compliance, thereby positioning celastrol as a promising candidate in the armamentarium against PCOS.

GW501516 (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #SML001),"Proposal for GW501516 (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #SML001)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
GW501516 (commercially known as Cardarine and available from Sigma-Aldrich as catalog #SML001) is a fully synthetic small molecule originally designed as a potent and selective agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ) subtype (Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023). Unlike naturally occurring fatty acids that serve as endogenous ligands for the PPAR family, GW501516 was developed through a structure–activity relationship–based medicinal chemistry approach to achieve high-affinity binding and selective activation of PPARδ (Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023). This compound is classified among synthetic PPAR agonists, specifically targeting the delta isoform, which is known to regulate genes involved in fatty acid transport, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, and overall energy metabolism. Historically, molecules in this class have been used in preclinical studies to exploit their “exercise mimetic” effects, boosting endurance, improving metabolic profiles, and enhancing insulin sensitivity in rodent models and, to some extent, in nonhuman primates (Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023). These compounds have been investigated mainly as therapeutics for metabolic diseases such as dyslipidemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of PPARδ agonists like GW501516 is predominantly rooted in their metabolic applications. Preclinical studies in rodent models have demonstrated that GW501516 promotes fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle, thereby improving systemic insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles (Dressel & Muscat, 2006; Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023). Moreover, GW501516 has been shown to reduce markers of inflammation and oxidative stress through mechanisms including enhanced AMPK activity and suppression of NF-κB signaling in both muscle and liver tissues (Salvadó et al., 2014; Barroso et al., 2012). Although its notable metabolic benefits have generated significant research interest, GW501516 has not been subjected to clinical trials specifically for treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) or conditions with similar reproductive metabolic dysfunctions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Instead, the compound’s therapeutic development has been halted in the clinical arena due to safety concerns, most notably the potential for tumorigenic effects in animal studies, particularly affecting tissues such as the liver and reproductive organs (Przybycień et al., 2022; Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023). Hence, while the metabolic efficacy of GW501516 has been established in non-reproductive models, its direct use—or repurposing—for PCOS remains largely speculative and would necessitate further dedicated studies in both preclinical and clinical settings.

Mechanism of Action:
GW501516 functions primarily via selective activation of PPARδ, a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that forms heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) to bind specific peroxisome proliferator-responsive elements in the promoters of its target genes. Upon activation, PPARδ increases transcription of genes critical for cellular fatty acid uptake, mitochondrial β-oxidation, and energy dissipation. Mechanistically, GW501516 has been demonstrated to upregulate key enzymes such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and other long-chain fatty acid oxidation genes (Dressel & Muscat, 2006; Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023). This activation results in an increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation rather than glycolysis, contributing to improved energy homeostasis. Additionally, GW501516 promotes AMPK phosphorylation, which is an energy sensor kinase that further supports mitochondrial biogenesis and enhances fatty acid oxidation (Salvadó et al., 2014). Through these pathways, GW501516 reduces intracellular lipid accumulation and potentially prevents accumulation of lipid intermediates that can impair insulin signaling. It also exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting signaling cascades such as NF-κB and ERK1/2, thereby reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, which are known to contribute to insulin resistance (Barroso et al., 2012; Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023). By improving lipid handling and reducing inflammation, GW501516 indirectly alleviates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress—a condition known to activate stress kinases such as JNK that impair insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) signaling via serine phosphorylation. The overall effect results in enhanced activity of the insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby bolstering glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues (Aguilar Recarte, 2021; Dressel & Muscat, 2006). Although much of this mechanistic insight has been derived from studies in skeletal muscle, pancreatic beta cells, liver, and adipocytes, the underlying principles are hypothesized to be applicable to ovarian granulosa cells, which also express nuclear receptors within the PPAR family (Przybycień et al., 2022; Komar, 2005).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for using GW501516 in PCOS is that PPARδ activation in ovarian granulosa cells will drive a metabolic reprogramming characterized by enhanced fatty acid oxidation and improved mitochondrial function. Specifically, the expected cascade is as follows: GW501516 binds to and activates PPARδ in granulosa cells, leading to an upregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. This increased oxidation capacity would reduce intracellular lipid accumulation—a common feature in PCOS that contributes to cell dysfunction and insulin resistance (Przybycień et al., 2022; Psilopatis et al., 2023). Furthermore, as lipid overload and accumulation of harmful lipid species are major triggers for endoplasmic reticulum stress, enhanced fatty acid oxidation should mitigate ER stress in granulosa cells. Relief of ER stress, in turn, is anticipated to decrease stress kinase activation (for example, through reduced JNK activation), thereby preventing serine phosphorylation of IRS-1—a modification that impairs insulin signaling. The net result is the restoration of robust insulin receptor activity and PI3K/Akt signaling, which is essential for glucose uptake and cellular energy metabolism in these cells (Psilopatis et al., 2023; Aguilar Recarte, 2021). In addition, improved insulin signaling in granulosa cells is expected to normalize steroidogenic functions and support proper folliculogenesis—a key factor for ovulation and fertility in PCOS patients (Przybycień et al., 2022; Komar, 2005). Although direct experimental evidence of GW501516 effects in granulosa cells has not been reported in the literature cited, the presence of PPAR isoforms in ovarian tissues, along with documented beneficial metabolic effects in other cell types, provides a compelling rationale for expecting similar outcomes in this context (Psilopatis et al., 2023; Przybycień et al., 2022). If the compound can indeed reduce intracellular lipid burden, relieve ER stress, and enhance insulin action, it would address several key pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in PCOS.

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating GW501516 as a therapeutic candidate for PCOS, several strengths are evident. First, the compound’s mechanism of action is well characterized in non-reproductive tissues—it selectively activates PPARδ, thereby promoting fatty acid oxidation, enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, and improving insulin sensitivity through well-defined pathways (Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023; Dressel & Muscat, 2006). The anti-inflammatory properties and reduction in ER stress observed in skeletal muscle and hepatic models suggest that GW501516 could correct metabolic dysfunctions that are also central to PCOS pathogenesis (Salvadó et al., 2014; Barroso et al., 2012). Second, the hypothesis that improved lipid handling in ovarian granulosa cells could restore insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt-mediated glucose uptake is supported indirectly by the metabolic benefits seen in other tissues, implying a plausible translational mechanism for addressing ovarian insulin resistance (Aguilar Recarte, 2021; Psilopatis et al., 2023). Third, the widespread expression of PPAR isoforms in ovarian tissues, and particularly the evidence that granulosa cells express PPARγ—with the possibility that PPARδ is also functionally relevant—provides a biological basis for expecting a therapeutic benefit in PCOS (Komar, 2005; Przybycień et al., 2022).

However, there are significant weaknesses and gaps that temper the enthusiasm for repurposing GW501516 for PCOS. Safety concerns loom large; preclinical studies in rodent models have demonstrated tumorigenic risks associated with GW501516, particularly in the liver, reproductive tissues, and other organs, which has prevented its clinical adoption for metabolic indications (Przybycień et al., 2022; Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023). These safety issues need to be rigorously addressed before any clinical consideration for PCOS, especially given the sensitivity of the reproductive system. Moreover, although there is a robust body of literature on GW501516’s metabolic effects in skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue, there is a notable paucity of direct experimental studies examining its impact on ovarian granulosa cells or in preclinical PCOS models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Przybycień et al., 2022). This represents a significant knowledge gap: without direct evidence demonstrating that the metabolic pathways modulated by GW501516 in other tissues operate similarly in granulosa cells, the therapeutic rationale remains largely theoretical. Another weakness is the potential off-target or systemic effects that may complicate the clinical profile of GW501516. Improvement in insulin sensitivity at a systemic level does not necessarily translate to restoration of proper ovarian steroidogenesis or follicular development because PCOS is a multifactorial disease with complex endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine regulatory networks (Psilopatis et al., 2023; Przybycień et al., 2022). Finally, despite promising pharmacokinetic data in rodent models, there is limited translational clinical data for GW501516, raising concerns about dose optimization, long-term efficacy, and safety in the context of chronic PCOS treatment (Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023).

In summary, GW501516 is a compelling candidate from a mechanistic standpoint, with its well-defined role in enhancing fatty acid oxidation, reducing inflammation, and improving insulin sensitivity via PPARδ activation—effects that could theoretically counteract several core metabolic disturbances in PCOS. However, the lack of direct data in ovarian cells and the significant safety concerns identified in preclinical studies are major hurdles that must be overcome. Strengths of the therapeutic candidate include its potent metabolic action and the robust preclinical evidence from non-reproductive systems, whereas weaknesses center on its tumorigenic potential, unexplored effects in granulosa cells, and the absence of clinical trial data in PCOS populations. Overall, while GW501516 appears promising on paper for repurposing as a treatment for PCOS—particularly by targeting the metabolic defects that underpin ovarian dysfunction—the current evidence remains insufficient, and further focused studies in ovarian models and comprehensive safety evaluations are urgently needed before proceeding to clinical trials for PCOS (Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023; Psilopatis et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Pyrvinium pamoate (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #P0022),"Proposal for Pyrvinium pamoate (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #P0022)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pyrvinium pamoate is a synthetic quinoline‐derived cyanine dye originally developed as an anthelmintic drug. Its synthesis traces back to early work in the 1940s and early 1950s, when compounds with cyanine dye characteristics were identified as active agents against parasitic worms. The compound is most commonly used in its pamoate salt form, which enhances its stability and permits oral dosing despite its inherent poor aqueous solubility. As a molecule, pyrvinium pamoate belongs to the class of antihelminthic agents that were historically used to treat enterobiasis (pinworm infection) and other helminth infections in both human and veterinary medicine (Downey et al., 2008; Desai, 1962). Over decades, while its primary indication has remained anti-parasitic therapy, its unique molecular structure and bioactivity profile have attracted interest as a repurposing candidate for novel indications beyond parasitology, including applications in oncology and metabolic diseases.

Therapeutic History:
Pyrvinium pamoate was first approved by the FDA in 1955 for the treatment of pinworm infections and has been widely utilized in both biomedical and veterinary settings for its antihelminthic properties (Downey et al., 2008; Beck, 1964). Clinically, its safety profile is well established, with doses up to 35 mg/kg/day being safely administered for short courses. Its extensive therapeutic history also includes repurposing studies where pyrvinium pamoate has been evaluated for anti-protozoal activity—for example, its in vitro and in vivo efficacy against Cryptosporidium parvum has been well documented (Downey et al., 2008; Downey et al., 2009). More recently, pyrvinium pamoate has been explored for its antitumor potential, where its ability to inhibit mitochondrial complex I and to modulate signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt, mTOR, and Wnt have been emphasized (Hamilton & Rath, 2018; Momtazi‐borojeni et al., 2018). However, despite its well‐documented metabolic effects in cancer cells and its emerging role in obesity models through caloric restriction mimicry, there are no reports or clinical trials that have tested pyrvinium pamoate directly in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) or in ovarian granulosa cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cochran et al., 2024). Its established use in other indications underscores the strong safety data available for short-term applications, yet its application in chronic metabolic conditions such as PCOS remains purely hypothetical at this stage.

Mechanism of Action:
The primary pharmacological action of pyrvinium pamoate is inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. By binding within the mitochondrial inner membrane, the drug disrupts electron transport, leading to a reduction in ATP production and a concomitant increase in the AMP/ATP ratio. This energy depletion triggers activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master sensor of cellular energy status that initiates adaptive metabolic responses including enhanced fatty acid oxidation and increased glucose uptake (Fu et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021). In addition to its effect on mitochondrial respiration, pyrvinium pamoate has been demonstrated to modulate key signaling pathways. In cancer cell models, the drug markedly attenuates PI3K/Akt signaling, leading to reduced Akt phosphorylation, and indirectly suppresses mTOR signaling—the latter being critical for anabolic cell growth and proliferation (Momtazi‐borojeni et al., 2018; Schumacher, 2024). In some studies, pyrvinium pamoate also down‐regulates β‐catenin through enhanced degradation, although this mechanism is more relevant to its anticancer activity rather than its metabolic effects (Venerando et al., 2013). The net biochemical consequence of these molecular events is reminiscent of the cellular adaptations seen with caloric restriction; by invoking an energy stress that activates AMPK and concomitantly suppresses mTOR and PI3K/Akt, pyrvinium pamoate shifts cellular metabolism from an anabolic to a catabolic state. This modulation is particularly promising in the context of insulin resistance, a core defect in PCOS, as activation of AMPK has been shown to enhance insulin receptor sensitivity and promote glucose uptake in insulin-responsive tissues (Tong et al., 2022; Tsai et al., 2023).

Expected Effect in PCOS Granulosa Cells:
In the proposed preclinical model focusing on PCOS, granulosa cells are known to exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired insulin signaling, and aberrant activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Administering a low dose of pyrvinium pamoate is hypothesized to partially inhibit mitochondrial complex I in these cells. The consequent reduction in ATP levels increases the AMP/ATP ratio, leading to robust activation of AMPK. Activated AMPK then down‐regulates mTOR activity, thereby reducing cellular anabolic signaling and promoting catabolic processes that restore homeostasis (Zhou et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2021). In parallel, the suppression of PI3K/Akt signaling by pyrvinium pamoate may initially seem counterintuitive since Akt is a critical mediator of insulin action; however, the hypothesis is that mild inhibition of PI3K/Akt—if balanced with the overall metabolic improvement achieved via AMPK activation—could restore proper insulin receptor signaling. In ovarian granulosa cells, impaired insulin signaling is a hallmark of PCOS and is linked with altered cellular metabolism and reduced glucose uptake. Thus, by mimicking a state of caloric restriction, pyrvinium pamoate is expected to improve the bioenergetic profile of granulosa cells, restore insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt signaling, and ultimately enhance glucose uptake and metabolic function (Tsai et al., 2023; Wang & Li, 2023). This mechanism is supported indirectly by studies in other metabolic contexts, where low‐dose mitochondrial inhibitors have been shown to activate AMPK and improve systemic insulin sensitivity. Notably, the expression of insulin signaling components, including the insulin receptor and PI3K, has been well documented in granulosa cells of women with PCOS, making these cells a relevant model for testing the metabolic efficacy of pyrvinium pamoate (Tong et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
The rationale for repurposing pyrvinium pamoate as a novel therapeutic for PCOS is built on its established ability to inhibit mitochondrial complex I, activate AMPK, and suppress anabolic pathways such as mTOR and PI3K/Akt. A significant strength is its extensive clinical use as an antihelminthic, which provides a robust foundation of safety data from decades of use in humans and animals (Beck, 1964; Desai, 1962). Additionally, emerging evidence from cancer and obesity models suggests that low‐dose mitochondrial inhibitors can induce a caloric restriction‐like state, thereby improving insulin sensitivity—a key therapeutic target in PCOS (Fu et al., 2021; Schumacher, 2024). The candidate’s mechanism of action aligns well with the pathophysiological derangements in PCOS granulosa cells, particularly those involving mitochondrial dysfunction and altered insulin receptor signaling.

Nonetheless, there are notable challenges and limitations. First, the poor bioavailability of pyrvinium pamoate, owing to its low absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, may limit its systemic exposure when used for chronic metabolic indications. This characteristic, while advantageous in avoiding systemic toxicity for short‐term anti‐parasitic treatments, may necessitate alternative formulations or delivery routes to achieve effective concentrations in ovarian tissue (Ponzini et al., 2023; Schumacher, 2024). Second, while the safety profile is well delineated for its use as an antihelminthic, long‐term administration aimed at modulating metabolic pathways in a chronic condition like PCOS has not been previously studied. This raises concerns about off‐target effects, especially given that chronic suppression of mitochondrial function might adversely affect tissues with high energy demands. Furthermore, the demonstrated inhibitory effects on PI3K/Akt signaling, while potentially beneficial for reducing aberrant anabolic signaling, must be carefully titrated because complete inhibition of this pathway could exacerbate insulin resistance rather than ameliorate it (Venerando et al., 2013; Wang & Li, 2023).

Another aspect to consider is that although pyrvinium’s activation of AMPK is promising, direct evidence linking its use to improved insulin receptor function in ovarian granulosa cells is lacking. Preclinical studies in relevant cell types are required to determine whether the downstream effects observed in cancer or hepatocyte models translate effectively to granulosa cells, which have a distinct metabolic and hormonal milieu (Tsai et al., 2023; Tong et al., 2022). Lastly, given that current clinical trials for PCOS have focused on agents such as metformin and NAC, which have a well‐established mechanism for improving insulin sensitivity without significant off‐target mitochondrial toxicity, pyrvinium pamoate represents a more unconventional approach that will require rigorous preclinical validation before clinical translation can be considered (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cochran et al., 2024).

In summary, while significant promise exists in the approach of using low‐dose mitochondrial inhibition to activate AMPK and suppress mTOR signaling—a strategy that has been validated in other metabolic conditions—the repurposing of pyrvinium pamoate for PCOS is still highly experimental. Its long history as an anthelmintic and emerging data in oncology suggest a viable mechanistic basis, yet the issues of poor bioavailability, potential off‐target effects, and the lack of direct evidence in PCOS models form critical challenges. Further in vitro studies in cultured granulosa cells, combined with appropriate in vivo models of PCOS, will be essential to verify whether the metabolic benefits observed in other tissues can be recapitulated in ovarian tissue. If these preclinical studies are successful, pyrvinium pamoate could serve as a foundation for designing novel analogs with improved pharmacokinetic profiles tailored for chronic metabolic disorders such as PCOS (Momtazi‐borojeni et al., 2018; Schumacher, 2024). Overall, as an expert drug development team leader, I find that pyrvinium pamoate presents an intriguing and innovative candidate based on its mitochondrial targeting capability; however, its repurposing for PCOS will depend on overcoming substantial formulation and safety challenges while demonstrating clear metabolic efficacy in relevant ovarian cell models.
