Query: Inflammatory and immune dysregulation in PCOS pathogenesis: pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles, NF-κB and JAK/STAT pathway activation in ovarian stromal and adipose-derived cells, toll-like receptor expression, and cell-based assay methodologies to quantify inflammatory signaling and cytokine secretion dynamics

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a multifactorial endocrine disorder in which chronic low‐grade inflammation and immune dysregulation are central to its pathogenesis. Key to this process is a disturbed pro‐inflammatory cytokine profile, characterized by elevated levels of IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, and IL-6, with consistent evidence showing increased cytokine secretion by ovarian granulosa cells and in the follicular fluid, thereby creating an altered microenvironment that disrupts follicular development (liu2021thereleaseof pages 1-2, velez2021inflammationandreproductive pages 4-5).

Inflammatory signaling in PCOS largely involves the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), a transcription factor that is critical for driving the expression of a range of pro-inflammatory genes. In ovarian stromal and adipose-derived cells, NF-κB pathway activation occurs via multiple stimuli, including Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation. For example, TLR4 is frequently upregulated and activated upon encountering PAMPs or DAMPs; this receptor triggers downstream recruitment of adaptor proteins, leading to the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65, its subsequent nuclear translocation, and the induction of cytokine transcription (wang2023signalingpathwaysand pages 5-6, sun2022tlr4nfκbsignalingcontributes pages 13-15). Alongside NF-κB, the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway has also been implicated, with its activation contributing to cytokine signaling amplification, although details on its precise dynamics in PCOS remain less extensively characterized within ovarian and adipose tissues (liu2024investigatingtherole pages 17-18, velez2021inflammationandreproductive pages 5-6).

Adipose tissue inflammation, in particular, plays a pivotal role in systemic and ovarian pathophysiology in PCOS. Enlarged adipocytes and a shift in macrophage polarization from the anti-inflammatory M2 to the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype result in the release of cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1, which further promote NF-κB activation and mediate insulin resistance. Additionally, free fatty acids released from hypertrophic adipocytes activate TLR4 signaling—fostering a feed-forward inflammatory loop that exacerbates metabolic dysfunction (stojanovic2024frommetabolismto pages 1-2, stojanovic2024frommetabolismto pages 2-4).

Cell-based assay methodologies for quantifying inflammation and cytokine secretion dynamics in PCOS integrate several complementary techniques designed to provide both quantitative and mechanistic insights. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is routinely employed to profile inflammatory gene expression in isolated ovarian stromal and adipose-derived cells, while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) quantify secreted cytokines in serum and follicular fluid (liu2024investigatingtherole pages 17-18, velez2021inflammationandreproductive pages 4-5). Western blotting and immunofluorescence techniques are used to assess the activation status of signaling molecules such as phosphorylated NF-κB p65, and the formation of inflammasome complexes. Recent studies have also applied integrated RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses coupled with bioinformatics tools like Metascape and Cytoscape to elucidate the network interactions between cytokines, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT pathway components, thus offering a system-level understanding of inflammatory dysregulation in PCOS (liu2024investigatingtherole pages 18-19, szukiewicz2022modulationofthe pages 11-13).

Overall, the interplay between a pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu, NF-κB and JAK/STAT signaling pathway activation, and abnormal TLR expression constitutes a central pathogenic mechanism in PCOS. The application of diverse cell-based assays has allowed researchers to quantify these dynamic signaling events and cytokine secretions, thereby providing both diagnostic insights and therapeutic targets designed to ameliorate ovarian and metabolic dysfunctions associated with this syndrome (velez2021inflammationandreproductive pages 6-7, sun2022tlr4nfκbsignalingcontributes pages 13-15).
