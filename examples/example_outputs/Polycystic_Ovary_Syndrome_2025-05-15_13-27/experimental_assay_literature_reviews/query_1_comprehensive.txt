Query: Comprehensive review of intracellular signaling pathways dysregulated in PCOS ovarian granulosa and theca cells including insulin receptor, PI3K/Akt, MAPK, AMPK, androgen receptor cross-talk, and downstream transcription factors relevant for cell culture assay design

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by complex intracellular signaling dysregulation in ovarian granulosa and theca cells. A comprehensive understanding of these pathways—from the insulin receptor to downstream transcription factors—is essential for designing robust cell culture assays that model the disease.

Insulin receptor (IR) signaling abnormalities are central to PCOS pathology. Altered IR function in PCOS is typified by decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and increased serine phosphorylation of both the receptor and its substrate proteins (e.g., IRS1/2), leading to insulin resistance even in non-adipose tissues. Genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic modifications further exacerbate these defects, setting the stage for disrupted metabolic signaling in ovarian cells (wang2023androgenexcessa pages 2-3, wang2023signalingpathwaysand pages 2-4). Cell culture assays must therefore assess IR expression and phosphorylation status as a primary endpoint.

Downstream of the insulin receptor, the PI3K/Akt pathway is critical in regulating cell survival, proliferation, and metabolic homeostasis. Insulin or IGF-1 binding leads to IRS-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which in turn phosphorylates Akt. Activated Akt modulates a number of downstream targets including the forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors. In PCOS, altered Akt activity and consequent dysregulation of FOXO factors (with FOXO1 being notably upregulated in granulosa cells) contribute to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and aberrant follicular development (ryu2019animalmodelsfor pages 15-17, zhang2023essentialroleof pages 17-18). A cell culture assay replicating PCOS conditions should therefore quantify both the phosphorylated forms of Akt and the expression or phosphorylation state of FOXO proteins.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, particularly via its ERK, p38, and JNK branches, is also prominently dysregulated in PCOS. MAPK signaling in ovarian cells contributes to the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In granulosa cells, stress stimuli and inflammatory mediators can lead to aberrant MAPK activation. Given this pathway’s role in mediating responses to hyperinsulinemia and oxidative stress, its cross-talk with other pathways such as PI3K/Akt is critical; thus, measuring phosphorylated ERK, p38, and JNK levels is advisable in PCOS cell culture models (wang2023signalingpathwaysand pages 10-12, ryu2019animalmodelsfor pages 13-15).

Adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as an energy sensor and plays an essential role in regulating cellular energy balance. In PCOS, impaired AMPK signaling contributes to diminished insulin sensitivity and metabolic imbalances in ovarian cells. Reduced AMPK expression or phosphorylation is associated with disrupted steroidogenesis and altered lipid metabolism in granulosa cells. Therefore, incorporating AMPK activity assays can provide insights into the metabolic defects associated with PCOS (mcilvenna2021polycysticovarysyndrome pages 71-74, zhang2023essentialroleof pages 17-18).

Androgen receptor (AR) cross-talk is another pivotal element in PCOS. Hyperandrogenemia and AR dysregulation not only affect steroidogenic enzyme expression (e.g., CYP17, aromatase) but also interact with insulin signaling pathways. This cross-talk exacerbates both metabolic dysfunction and follicular arrest. AR signaling influences downstream transcription factors, including SF-1 and components of the NF-κB pathway, thereby modifying gene expression profiles crucial for follicle development (wang2023androgenexcessa pages 14-14, ryu2019animalmodelsfor pages 24-26).

Downstream transcription factors such as FOXO, SF-1, NF-κB, and others play integrative roles by translating the altered signaling cascades into changes in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis. Their regulation offers potential readouts for PCOS in vitro models. Assays designed to capture these dynamics should include measurements of both transcription factor expression and post-translational modifications, which reflect the integrated cellular response to dysregulated upstream signaling (luo2021theroleof pages 6-6, mcilvenna2021polycysticovarysyndrome pages 36-39).

In summary, an effective cell culture assay for PCOS should integrate multiple endpoints: the phosphorylation status of the insulin receptor and its substrates, PI3K/Akt activation and downstream FOXO regulation, MAPK pathway activity via ERK, p38, and JNK, AMPK signaling status reflecting energy balance, and androgen receptor activity along with key transcription factor outputs. This integrated approach mirrors the multifactorial etiology of PCOS and provides a platform for robust mechanistic and therapeutic investigations (ryu2019animalmodelsfor pages 15-17, wang2023androgenexcessa pages 2-3).
