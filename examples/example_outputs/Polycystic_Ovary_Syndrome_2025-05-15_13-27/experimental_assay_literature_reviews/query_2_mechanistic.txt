Query: Mechanistic studies on hyperandrogenism-mediated effects on human ovarian follicular cells: molecular basis of steroidogenesis enzyme regulation, LH/FSH receptor signaling, CYP17A1 and CYP19A1 transcriptional networks, androgen receptor coactivators, and potential in vitro phenotypic readout parameters

Hyperandrogenism in PCOS drives several molecular alterations in human ovarian follicular cells through direct effects on steroidogenic enzyme regulation, gonadotropin receptor signaling, and androgen receptor (AR) coactivator networks. At the core of this dysregulation is an imbalance in steroidogenesis. LH stimulation of theca cells upregulates enzymes such as CYP17A1, which catalyzes androgen production, whereas granulosa cells suffer from reduced expression and aberrant regulation of CYP19A1 (aromatase), leading to impaired conversion of androgens into estrogens (wang2023androgenexcessa pages 2-3, wang2023androgenexcessa pages 7-9).

The molecular basis of steroidogenic enzyme regulation is further complicated by the influence of insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinemia selectively exaggerates the expression of CYP17A1 and other steroidogenic proteins through enhanced PI3K/AKT and MAPK-ERK pathway signaling. This results in potentiation of androgen synthesis while simultaneously perturbing local ovarian insulin receptor expression and function (wang2023androgenexcessa pages 2-3, wang2023androgenexcessa pages 10-11).

Gonadotropin receptor signaling is also altered under hyperandrogenic conditions. Elevated LH levels and a concomitant reduction in FSH receptor (FSHR) expression have been observed, shifting the balance of gonadotropin signals. The reduced FSH responsiveness in granulosa cells further diminishes CYP19A1 expression, compounding the estrogen deficiency observed in PCOS. This LH/FSHR imbalance not only affects steroidogenic enzyme transcription networks but also leads to altered cellular proliferation and survival cues within the ovarian follicle (devillers2023androgenreceptorsignaling pages 10-12, wang2023androgenexcessa pages 3-4).

At the transcriptional level, the networks controlling CYP17A1 and CYP19A1 are modulated by direct AR signaling and its associated coactivators. When androgens bind to AR, the resulting receptor complex undergoes conformational changes and nuclear translocation. However, under chronic hyperandrogenic exposure, there is an increase in K48-linked polyubiquitination of AR in granulosa cells, leading to its proteasomal degradation. In contrast, intracellular abundance of coactivators such as FHL2—overexpressed under DHT stimulation—further modulates transcriptional activity by acting as a co-repressor or coactivator depending on context. Moreover, splice variants of AR (e.g., Ins-AR and Del-AR) with altered domains can delay nuclear import and modify the transcriptional regulation of downstream targets, including CYP17A1 (upregulated) and CYP19A1 (downregulated) (wang2023androgenexcessa pages 9-10, wang2023androgenexcessa pages 13-14).

The impact of hyperandrogenism on ovarian follicular cells can be comprehensively evaluated in vitro utilizing several phenotypic readouts. Common approaches include:
• Quantitative measurement of steroid hormone levels (androgens and estrogens) via immunoassays.
• Gene expression analysis of key steroidogenic enzymes (CYP17A1, CYP19A1), gonadotropin receptors (FSHR, LHCGR), and AR mRNA levels by RT-qPCR.
• Reporter gene assays to monitor AR transcriptional activity and assessment of coactivator interactions.
• Western blotting and phosphorylation assays to determine the activation status of signaling proteins, such as ERK1/2 and components of the PI3K/AKT cascade.
• Functional assays including follicular growth in 3D culture systems and granulosa cell proliferation and apoptosis, often monitored via cell cycle regulators like Cyclin D2 and Cdkn1b (p27KIP1) (devillers2023androgenreceptorsignaling pages 9-10, wang2023androgenexcessa pages 7-9).

Collectively, these molecular and cellular parameters establish a framework for understanding hyperandrogenism-mediated effects on ovarian follicular cells. They highlight the interplay between steroidogenic enzyme regulation, altered gonadotropin receptor signaling, transcriptional network imbalances driven by AR and its coactivators, and the downstream functional consequences observable using well‐characterized in vitro phenotypic assays (wang2023androgenexcessa pages 13-14, devillers2023androgenreceptorsignaling pages 10-12).
