Proposal for 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA; Sigma-Aldrich catalog #P21005)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
4‐Phenylbutyric acid (4‐PBA) is a synthetic fatty acid derivative that was originally developed more than a century ago through chemical modification of butyric acid; this was achieved by introducing an aromatic phenyl residue into the butyric acid backbone via reaction processes involving benzene and butyrolactone in the presence of aluminum chloride (He & Moreau, 2019). The addition of the phenyl group not only distinguishes 4‐PBA from naturally occurring butyrate but also enhances its pharmacokinetic properties by increasing its half‐life and stability. This compound belongs to a class of molecules known as short‐chain fatty acid derivatives, which have been repurposed over the years from their initial use in rare metabolic conditions to broader applications in metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as protein misfolding disorders. Importantly, 4‐PBA functions as a chemical chaperone, a role that involves entering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and facilitating the correct folding of nascent proteins, thereby reducing the accumulation of misfolded proteins that trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR) (He & Moreau, 2019). Besides its chemical chaperone properties, 4‐PBA also exhibits weak histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory activity when used at higher doses, a secondary mechanism that may modulate gene expression via epigenetic pathways. Its dual role in promoting proper protein folding and modifying gene expression has established 4‐PBA as a versatile molecule. In clinical practice, its utility is most evident in its FDA‐approved indication for treating urea cycle disorders, where it acts as an ammonia scavenger. The extensive clinical experience and well‐characterized absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profiles of 4‐PBA underscore its potential for repurposing to new therapeutic indications such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) (He & Moreau, 2019; Kolb et al., 2015).

Therapeutic History
Clinically, 4‐PBA has a storied history of application that began with its use in metabolic detoxification disorders. In patients with urea cycle disorders, the compound acts by converting itself through beta‐oxidation into active metabolites that conjugate with glutamine, ultimately forming phenylacetylglutamine—a metabolite that is efficiently excreted by the kidneys. This ammonia‐scavenging process has been the cornerstone of its clinical use, providing life-saving treatment for individuals suffering from hyperammonemia (Kolb et al., 2015). Over time, the therapeutic potential of 4‐PBA has been explored across a continuum of diseases characterized by ER stress. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that 4‐PBA can alleviate ER stress not only in hepatocytes and pancreatic β‐cells but also in adipocytes and neuronal cells. For instance, in experimental models of diabetes and obesity, 4‐PBA was shown to reduce markers of ER stress and improve insulin sensitivity (Liong & Lappas, 2015; Khan et al., 2017). Such studies have provided evidence that when ER stress is mitigated, there is a subsequent improvement in insulin receptor signaling and metabolic regulation, aspects that are critical in disorders marked by insulin resistance. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, 4‐PBA has also been evaluated for its neuroprotective properties; experiments in various models (including those of Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases) have indicated that 4‐PBA can reduce ER stress–induced neuronal apoptosis and enhance cell survival (Mimori et al., 2017). Moreover, the compound’s quantification in cell culture media via methods like liquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry has further underscored its relevance in preclinical experimentation (Villani et al., 2023). Despite its broad experimental use, a search in clinical trial databases for “4-Phenylbutyric acid AND Polycystic Ovary Syndrome” reveals that there are currently no registered clinical trials directly evaluating its use in PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nonetheless, the pathophysiological similarities between PCOS and other metabolic disorders where 4‐PBA has shown beneficial effects provide a compelling rationale for exploring its use in PCOS. PCOS is characterized by insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and chronic cellular stress—all conditions that have been ameliorated by 4‐PBA in other settings (Chen et al., 2023; Kolb et al., 2015).

Mechanism of Action
The central mechanism of action for 4‐PBA revolves around its capacity to mitigate endoplasmic reticulum stress—a pathological state that arises when the protein-folding machinery of the ER is overwhelmed by an excess of misfolded proteins. Under normal circumstances, resident ER chaperones such as GRP78 (also known as BiP) assist in proper protein folding. However, in conditions of excessive stress, the accumulation of misfolded proteins initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is mediated by three primary transmembrane sensors: PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 (He & Moreau, 2019). The activation of PERK leads to the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), which in turn results in a transient reduction in global protein synthesis and the preferential translation of stress-related proteins such as CHOP—a pro-apoptotic transcription factor. Chronic activation of this pathway is associated with cellular dysfunction and apoptosis.

4‐PBA exerts its chaperoning function by directly enhancing the folding capacity of the ER; it effectively reduces the load of misfolded proteins, thereby dampening the activation of UPR sensors and the release of downstream effectors like CHOP (He & Moreau, 2019; Kolb et al., 2015). One of the major consequences of excessive ER stress is the activation of stress kinases such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Active JNK can phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) on specific serine residues, which impedes the normal tyrosine phosphorylation events required for effective insulin signal propagation through the PI3K/Akt pathway (Kolb et al., 2015; Khan et al., 2017). Under normal physiological conditions, insulin binding to its receptor triggers a signaling cascade that involves IRS-1 and ultimately leads to activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, facilitating glucose uptake in cells. However, when IRS-1 is aberrantly serine phosphorylated due to the action of JNK, insulin signaling becomes dysfunctional, resulting in insulin resistance—a hallmark of both type 2 diabetes and PCOS.

In addition to its role as a chemical chaperone, 4‐PBA has been documented to possess weak inhibitory activity against histone deacetylases (HDACs) at higher concentrations. HDAC inhibition can lead to an alteration in chromatin structure and, consequently, changes in gene expression. Such epigenetic modifications may contribute to the modulation of stress responses, inflammatory cytokine production, and metabolic regulatory pathways (Khan et al., 2017; Mimori et al., 2017). Thus, the overall mechanism of action of 4‐PBA is twofold: it directly enhances protein folding within the ER, thereby reducing ER stress and its downstream effects such as JNK-mediated serine phosphorylation of IRS-1; and it may also bring about beneficial alterations in gene expression through its HDAC inhibitory effect.

Moreover, several studies support that the alleviation of ER stress by 4‐PBA correlates with improvements in insulin sensitivity. For example, in experimental models of obesity and type 2 diabetes, administration of 4‐PBA has been associated with a decrease in ER stress markers and a concomitant improvement in insulin receptor signaling, reflected in enhanced Akt activation (Liong & Lappas, 2015). The integration of these effects underlines the potential for 4‐PBA to counteract insulin resistance by restoring the functionality of the insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt pathway, a development that is particularly promising when considering tissues such as ovarian granulosa cells, where insulin signaling plays a critical role in cellular metabolism and folliculogenesis.

Expected Effect in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a multifactorial endocrine disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and insulin resistance. Among the myriad cellular disturbances observed in PCOS, chronic ER stress within ovarian granulosa cells emerges as a significant contributor to the impaired insulin signaling that underlies many of its metabolic complications. Granulosa cells are essential for the development and maturation of ovarian follicles, and their proper function depends on balanced insulin receptor signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway. However, in PCOS, persistent ER stress is believed to trigger a pathological cascade that includes the overactivation of PERK, phosphorylation of eIF2α, and subsequent induction of JNK activity (He & Moreau, 2019; Chen et al., 2023).

The anticipated mode of therapeutic action for 4‐PBA in the context of PCOS is predicated on its ability to act as a chemical chaperone in ovarian granulosa cells. Upon administration, 4‐PBA is expected to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and improve the folding of deficient or misfolded proteins. This improved protein homeostasis should lead to a reduction in the activation of UPR sensors—including PERK—and result in a decrease in the phosphorylation of eIF2α (He & Moreau, 2019). As a consequence of this dampening of ER stress, the activation of downstream stress kinases such as JNK is expected to be attenuated. Since active JNK is directly implicated in the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, its inhibition should theoretically reduce the inhibitory modifications on IRS-1, thereby allowing for the restoration of appropriate insulin signaling through the insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt pathway (Kolb et al., 2015; Khan et al., 2017).

In ovarian granulosa cells, the restoration of insulin signaling is not only crucial for glucose uptake but also for maintaining the hormonal environment favorable for follicular development. Insulin resistance in granulosa cells contributes to dysfunctional steroidogenesis, disturbed folliculogenesis, and ultimately impaired fertility. Preclinical findings from studies involving other insulin-resistant tissues have demonstrated that 4‐PBA can significantly improve insulin receptor signaling and enhance downstream Akt activation, which is pivotal for promoting glucose uptake and overall cellular energy balance (Liong & Lappas, 2015). Although the direct experimental evidence for these effects in granulosa cells is not yet extensive, the established mechanisms of 4‐PBA in reducing ER stress and mitigating JNK activation provide a strong biochemical rationale for its expected beneficial effects in the ovarian microenvironment.

Furthermore, by indirectly reducing IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, 4‐PBA may help shift the balance from a pro-inflammatory and stress-induced state towards one of improved metabolic homeostasis. This shift is especially relevant because the impaired insulin signaling observed in PCOS is a central driver of both the metabolic and reproductive disturbances in the syndrome. In addition to its chaperone activity, any secondary HDAC inhibitory effects of 4‐PBA may contribute to favorable changes in the expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism and inflammation, further enhancing its therapeutic potential in PCOS (Khan et al., 2017; Mimori et al., 2017).

Overall, the expected effect of 4‐PBA in PCOS would be a significant improvement in insulin receptor signaling within granulosa cells. This improvement would be achieved through the reduction of ER stress markers, decreased activation of the PERK/eIF2α/JNK signaling axis, and a lowering of inhibitory IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. Ultimately, this restored signaling pathway should lead to increased glucose uptake and improved metabolic and endocrine function in the ovary, potentially resulting in better folliculogenesis, reduced hyperandrogenism, and improved fertility in patients with PCOS (He & Moreau, 2019; Chen et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation
Integrating the historical data, the molecular mechanism of action, and the expected physiological effects, 4‐Phenylbutyric acid emerges as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. Several key strengths and considerations support this view:

1. Established Clinical Safety and Well‐Characterized ADME Profile:
4‐PBA has an extensive track record of clinical use in urea cycle disorders and has been administered safely to a diverse patient population for years. Its detailed ADME profile and regulatory approval by the FDA significantly reduce the hurdles associated with repurposing a drug for a new indication. This safety record is especially important given that PCOS is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, meaning that any candidate must exhibit minimal toxicity and high tolerability (He & Moreau, 2019; Kolb et al., 2015).

2. Robust Mechanistic Rationale—Targeting ER Stress and Insulin Resistance:
The molecular underpinnings of PCOS involve a complex interplay between insulin resistance, chronic cellular stress, and disrupted hormonal signaling. The mechanism of action of 4‐PBA addresses these fundamental issues by serving as a chemical chaperone that improves protein folding within the ER. By doing so, it reduces the misfolded protein load, minimizes the activation of UPR sensors such as PERK, and subsequently decreases the phosphorylation of eIF2α. This cascade ultimately results in reduced activation of JNK, lowering the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and thereby restoring normal signaling through the insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt pathway. Given that impaired insulin signaling is a central feature of the metabolic disturbances in PCOS, its restoration in ovarian granulosa cells is anticipated to bring about improvements not only in cellular glucose uptake but also in broader metabolic regulation and follicular development (He & Moreau, 2019; Kolb et al., 2015; Khan et al., 2017).

3. Preclinical Evidence Supporting Insulin Sensitivity Improvement:
Studies in animal models of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic syndromes have demonstrated that 4‐PBA can alleviate ER stress and promote insulin sensitivity in tissues vital to glucose metabolism, including the liver, adipose tissue, and pancreatic β‐cells (Liong & Lappas, 2015; Khan et al., 2017). Although direct evidence in ovarian granulosa cells remains limited, the similar underpinning mechanisms across various insulin-sensitive tissues support the plausibility that granulosa cells in PCOS would benefit in a similar manner.

4. Potential for Epigenetic and Long-Term Beneficial Effects:
At higher concentrations, the HDAC inhibitory activity of 4‐PBA may provide supplementary benefits by altering gene expression patterns in ways that combat inflammation and sustain metabolic homeostasis. This epigenetic modulation could further enhance the long-term efficacy of the treatment by favorably adjusting the cellular stress response over time (Khan et al., 2017; Mimori et al., 2017).

5. Therapeutic Gap in Current PCOS Treatments:
Current treatment modalities for PCOS have significant limitations, particularly in addressing the fundamental metabolic dysfunction underlying insulin resistance. While agents such as metformin help improve insulin sensitivity, their effects on ER stress and direct cellular stress responses in ovarian tissue are not fully optimal. 4‐PBA, by directly targeting ER stress, offers a novel therapeutic angle that could complement or enhance existing treatments, potentially leading to more comprehensive management of both the metabolic and reproductive aspects of PCOS (Chen et al., 2023).

Despite these strengths, some challenges and considerations must be acknowledged:

a. Limited Direct Evidence in Ovarian Granulosa Cells and PCOS Models:
While there is robust preclinical evidence in other metabolic tissues, direct studies evaluating the effects of 4‐PBA in ovarian granulosa cells or in animal models of PCOS are currently sparse. A search of clinical trial databases confirms that 4‐PBA has not yet been directly studied in PCOS patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Future research must prioritize investigations that specifically examine the compound’s impact on ovarian cellular biology and insulin signaling within the reproductive context (Chen et al., 2023).

b. Optimal Dosage and Formulation Challenges:
Even though 4‐PBA is clinically approved and its ADME profile is well characterized, there are known issues related to its dosing form. Because the compound is commonly administered in its sodium salt form, there can be concerns related to sodium load, which may be problematic in patients with cardiovascular or renal concerns. Furthermore, adverse effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances have been noted in other clinical uses. Tailoring the dosing regimen for PCOS—possibly through modified-release formulations or lower dosing strategies—will be essential to maximize therapeutic benefit while minimizing side effects (He & Moreau, 2019).

c. Multifactorial Nature of PCOS:
PCOS is a heterogeneous and multifaceted syndrome, involving not only insulin resistance but also hyperandrogenism, ovarian dysfunction, and chronic low-grade inflammation. As such, while restoring insulin signaling in granulosa cells could significantly improve metabolic and follicular outcomes, it may not address other pathogenic aspects of PCOS on its own. Combination therapies that integrate 4‐PBA with other agents targeting androgen excess or inflammation might be required to achieve optimal clinical benefits.

d. Secondary Mechanisms and Off-Target Effects:
The secondary HDAC inhibitory effect of 4‐PBA, though potentially beneficial from an epigenetic standpoint, may also lead to off-target modulation of gene expression that could have unforeseen consequences. It will be important to delineate the dose at which chemical chaperoning predominates over HDAC inhibition, or whether both mechanisms can be synergistically harnessed without adverse effects.

e. Need for Rigorous Preclinical and Clinical Evaluation:
Before proceeding to large-scale clinical trials, further preclinical studies employing in vitro models of ovarian granulosa cells derived from PCOS patients or appropriate animal models of PCOS will be needed. These studies should rigorously assess if 4‐PBA can indeed lower PERK/eIF2α-mediated JNK activation and reduce IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, thereby restoring insulin receptor signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Such experimental validation will be crucial to substantiate the hypothesis that improvement in cellular glucose uptake within the ovarian microenvironment translates into beneficial clinical outcomes for PCOS (He & Moreau, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Conclusion
In summary, the repurposing of 4‐Phenylbutyric acid (4‐PBA) for the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is a compelling therapeutic proposition underpinned by strong mechanistic rationale and expansive preclinical evidence in related metabolic disorders. Its origin as a synthetic derivative of butyric acid, with enhanced pharmacokinetics and dual action as a chemical chaperone and HDAC inhibitor, has already been leveraged effectively in the treatment of urea cycle disorders and explored in models of obesity, diabetes, and neurodegeneration (He & Moreau, 2019; Kolb et al., 2015).

The key pathological process targeted by 4‐PBA in this repurposing strategy is ER stress—a significant contributor to insulin resistance via the activation of the PERK/eIF2α/JNK signaling cascade and the subsequent inhibitory serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. By improving protein folding within the ER and dampening the UPR, 4‐PBA is expected to restore proper insulin signaling via the insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt pathway in ovarian granulosa cells, which is critical for normal follicular development and metabolic homeostasis in PCOS (He & Moreau, 2019; Kolb et al., 2015; Khan et al., 2017).

While the extensive clinical safety data associated with 4‐PBA in other indications is highly encouraging, several challenges remain. Chief among these is the need for direct experimental verification of the compound’s effects in granulosa cells and PCOS models. The absence of any registered clinical trials for 4‐PBA specifically targeting PCOS underscores the novelty of this approach and the necessity for further preclinical work (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, questions regarding optimal dosing strategies, potential sodium load issues, and off-target effects via HDAC inhibition must be carefully addressed in future studies.

Nevertheless, the overall evaluation of 4‐PBA as a candidate for PCOS is decidedly positive. Its established ability to reduce ER stress and improve insulin sensitivity in numerous metabolic tissues—coupled with a well-understood mechanism of action—provides a robust foundation for its repurposing. As our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of PCOS continues to evolve, particularly the role of ER stress in ovarian dysfunction and insulin resistance, 4‐PBA represents a novel and innovative therapeutic avenue that could complement existing treatments or be integrated into combination therapies for a more effective management of this complex syndrome.

Moving forward, it will be critical to design comprehensive in vitro studies using human granulosa cells, as well as in vivo experiments in relevant animal models of PCOS, to confirm that 4‐PBA can indeed reduce ER stress markers such as phosphorylated eIF2α and CHOP, lower JNK activation, and consequently diminish IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. Such studies should also investigate any epigenetic changes associated with HDAC inhibition to ensure that the net effect is beneficial for cellular metabolism and reproductive function (Chen et al., 2023).

Given the mechanistic insights provided by various studies – including those detailing the modulation of ER stress-induced pathways in metabolic and neuronal contexts (Liong & Lappas, 2015; Khan et al., 2017; Mimori et al., 2017) – there is strong justification for further exploration of 4‐PBA in PCOS. In the long run, if preclinical studies yield promising results, clinical trials designed specifically to assess 4‐PBA's impact on ovarian insulin signaling and metabolic parameters in PCOS patients could pave the way for its adoption as a novel therapeutic approach. Such trials would ideally include detailed biomarker analysis of ER stress and insulin signaling components in ovarian tissue, alongside assessments of clinical outcomes such as improvements in menstrual regularity, reductions in androgen levels, and enhanced fertility.

In conclusion, 4‐Phenylbutyric acid is an especially attractive candidate for repurposing in the treatment of PCOS due to its multifaceted mechanism of action centered on the alleviation of ER stress. Its robust safety profile, established clinical use, and compelling preclinical evidence supporting improvements in insulin sensitivity collectively argue in favor of its further investigation. Although significant challenges remain—including the need for direct evidence in ovarian cells and optimal dosing regimens—the therapeutic promise of 4‐PBA in addressing the core metabolic and reproductive disturbances in PCOS is considerable. With strategic preclinical research and eventual clinical validation, 4‐PBA could well become part of a new generation of targeted therapies aimed at restoring normal cellular function in PCOS, ultimately offering improved outcomes for affected women (He & Moreau, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chen et al., 2023).
