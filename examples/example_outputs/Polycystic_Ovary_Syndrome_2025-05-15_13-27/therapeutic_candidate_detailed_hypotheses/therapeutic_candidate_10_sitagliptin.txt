Proposal for Sitagliptin (Merck; DPP-4 inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sitagliptin is a synthetic, orally administered small‐molecule inhibitor originally developed by Merck, and it belongs to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor class that has been widely utilized for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to its ability to enhance the activity of incretin hormones (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This compound was discovered through medicinal chemistry optimization efforts aimed at specifically and reversibly inhibiting the DPP-4 enzyme, leading to extended half-life and increased bioavailability of endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (Daneshjou et al., 2020). As a member of the DPP-4 inhibitor class, sitagliptin has a well-characterized pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and has been approved in many countries for glucose management in patients with T2DM (Devin et al., 2020). The synthetic origins of sitagliptin involve structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies that targeted the DPP-4 enzyme’s active site to achieve high selectivity and potency, setting the foundation for its subsequent clinical development (Ferjan et al., 2017). Its chemical structure features a β-amino acid core that is central to binding the catalytic domain of DPP-4, and this molecular framework distinguishes it from other antihyperglycemic agents (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Clinically, sitagliptin has been used extensively in the treatment of T2DM where its ability to increase circulating GLP-1 levels leads to an improvement in post-prandial insulin secretion and glycemic control (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Several clinical studies and trials, including those registered as NCT03122041 and NCT05972928, have evaluated sitagliptin in subsets of patients with metabolic dysregulation, including populations with risk factors akin to those seen in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023). Preclinical investigations and early clinical data in PCOS populations have pointed to the potential for sitagliptin to improve ovarian function and insulin sensitivity; for example, rodent models of PCOS have shown that DPP-4 inhibition by sitagliptin improves glucose uptake and ovarian histology, suggesting a beneficial role in correcting metabolic and reproductive abnormalities (Daneshjou et al., 2020). In addition to its established use in T2DM, sitagliptin has been evaluated for off-label applications in conditions characterized by insulin resistance, including PCOS, where its role in indirectly modulating ovarian insulin sensitivity is of significant interest (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020). Although the majority of the therapeutic history for sitagliptin involves metabolic disease, emerging data support its repurposing for PCOS, wherein insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism are central features (Daneshjou et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, sitagliptin exerts its biological effect by selectively inhibiting DPP-4, an enzyme responsible for the rapid cleavage and inactivation of incretin hormones such as GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) (Devin et al., 2020). By preventing GLP-1 degradation, sitagliptin prolongs the hormone’s circulating half-life, thereby enhancing its insulinotropic effects in a glucose-dependent manner (Ferjan et al., 2017). The elevated endogenous GLP-1 then binds to its receptor (GLP-1R) on pancreatic beta cells, triggering a cascade that involves the generation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and subsequent activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (Sun et al., 2020). This activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway not only facilitates insulin secretion but also promotes cross-talk with the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, which is critically involved in cell survival, energy metabolism, and insulin sensitization (Liu et al., 2024). In ovarian granulosa cells, these pathways are particularly important because the PI3K/Akt cascade has been implicated in promoting cellular proliferation, steroidogenesis, and overall follicular development (Sun et al., 2020). Additionally, enhanced GLP-1 signaling through increased cAMP levels has been associated with reduced activity of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) pathway, thereby attenuating pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and chronic low-grade inflammation, which are known contributors to PCOS pathophysiology (Devin et al., 2020). Collectively, these molecular interactions offer a plausible explanation for how sitagliptin might improve insulin sensitivity in ovarian tissue, reduce inflammation, and thereby ameliorate multiple metabolic and reproductive derangements observed in PCOS (Khan et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis underpinning the repurposing of sitagliptin for PCOS is that by elevating endogenous GLP-1 levels, the compound will enhance insulin sensitivity in ovarian granulosa cells via a cAMP/PKA-dependent amplification of PI3K/Akt signaling and reduce NFκB-mediated inflammatory activity (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In ovarian granulosa cells, improved insulin sensitivity is expected to promote better glucose uptake and improved steroidogenesis, ultimately leading to normalized follicular development and ovulation; these cells express both the GLP-1 receptor and components of the downstream signaling cascades, such as PKA and Akt, which have been documented in preclinical studies (Daneshjou et al., 2020). Moreover, the capacity of sitagliptin to reduce visceral adipose tissue, as demonstrated in clinical investigations, may assist in lowering systemic insulin resistance, an important driver of hyperandrogenism in PCOS (Devin et al., 2020). By reducing the inflammatory environment through inhibition of NFκB, sitagliptin could further mitigate the ovarian tissue inflammation that contributes to impaired granulosa cell function and folliculogenesis, thereby potentially restoring normal endocrine and reproductive function (Liu et al., 2024). The expected outcome in a clinical assay would be an improvement in ovarian insulin sensitivity marked by enhanced early insulin secretion, lowered post-prandial blood glucose, and favorable shifts in ovarian hormone profiles, as well as improved histological features such as reduced cyst formation and normalized granulosa cell apoptosis (Yadegari, 2021). Additionally, reductions in visceral adiposity and improved metabolic markers indirectly support an improved ovarian microenvironment that favors better follicular maturation (Devin et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, sitagliptin represents a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of PCOS due to its well-established safety profile, extensive clinical use in T2DM, and the compelling molecular rationale that supports its repurposing for metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions associated with PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). The strengths of sitagliptin include its ability to enhance endogenous GLP-1 levels, thereby indirectly activating cAMP/PKA-dependent and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways that are critical for both pancreatic beta cell and ovarian granulosa cell function (Devin et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). This mechanism not only improves insulin secretion and sensitivity but also has the added potential to reduce chronic inflammation via NFκB suppression, which may further contribute to the restoration of normal ovarian function (Liu et al., 2024). Furthermore, clinical data from studies in related metabolic disorders have demonstrated sitagliptin’s efficacy in reducing hyperglycemia, visceral fat, and some inflammatory markers, supporting its potential utility in PCOS where insulin resistance and visceral adiposity are major pathological features (Daneshjou et al., 2021; Devin et al., 2020).

Nevertheless, several weaknesses and unanswered questions must be considered. Although preclinical models and early-phase clinical investigations offer promising signals, direct evidence of sitagliptin’s impact on ovarian granulosa cell signaling—specifically through cAMP/PKA–PI3K/Akt and NFκB pathways—in human PCOS patients remains limited (Daneshjou et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). Additionally, while the drug’s metabolic benefits in reducing visceral adiposity and improving beta cell function are clear in diabetic populations, translating these benefits to the reproductive aspects of PCOS, such as folliculogenesis and ovulation, requires further rigorous clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Daneshjou et al., 2021). There is also the challenge of distinguishing the direct effects on ovarian tissue from systemic improvements in insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, as improvements in these metabolic parameters may not directly translate to enhanced reproductive outcomes (Devin et al., 2020).

Moreover, although the theoretical framework based on GLP-1 signaling is robust, the degree to which sitagliptin can modulate the intracellular signaling cascade within the ovarian microenvironment—particularly through PKA–mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and suppression of NFκB—is not fully elucidated in clinical settings (Khan et al., 2022; Devin et al., 2020). Another consideration is the relative magnitude of the anti-inflammatory effects; while some studies in diabetic populations show a reduction in inflammatory cytokines with DPP-4 inhibitors, similar outcomes have not been consistently observed in PCOS trials, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory efficacy may be context-dependent (Devin et al., 2020). Additionally, complex pathophysiological factors in PCOS, including hyperandrogenism, chronic low-grade inflammation, and ovarian stromal fibrosis, may require combination therapy strategies or adjunct treatments alongside sitagliptin to achieve meaningful clinical improvements (Wang et al., 2019).

On the strength side, sitagliptin’s mechanism of action via DPP-4 inhibition is well understood and has been demonstrated to have favorable safety and tolerability in numerous studies over extended periods in T2DM populations, providing a strong clinical foundation for its repurposing (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Ferjan et al., 2017). The drug’s oral administration route and once-daily dosing regimen also present practical advantages in terms of patient compliance compared to injectable therapies such as GLP-1 receptor agonists (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Furthermore, the potential dual benefits of improved metabolic control and possible positive effects on ovarian function position sitagliptin as a multifaceted therapeutic agent that could address both the endocrine and metabolic components of PCOS (Daneshjou et al., 2021; Devin et al., 2020).

In summary, the repurposing of sitagliptin for PCOS is supported by a strong biochemical rationale, which is centered on the enhancement of endogenous GLP-1 levels leading to improved insulin sensitivity and anti-inflammatory effects through cAMP/PKA and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. This mechanism is expected to translate into improved ovarian granulosa cell function and normalized follicular development, thereby potentially alleviating both the metabolic and reproductive abnormalities associated with PCOS (Liu et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2020). However, while the preclinical evidence and indirect clinical data from metabolic studies are promising, further dedicated clinical trials in PCOS populations are necessary to validate these effects and to delineate the specific pathways involved in ovarian tissues (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; Mukherjee et al., 2023). The overall strengths of sitagliptin, including its established safety profile, oral dosing convenience, and mechanistic plausibility via incretin enhancement, make it a promising candidate for drug repurposing in PCOS; yet, challenges remain in establishing direct efficacy in improving reproductive outcomes independently from metabolic improvements (Etrusco et al., 2024).

Given the potential for sitagliptin to correct metabolic disturbances that are intimately linked to the pathogenesis of PCOS, and the supportive preclinical data demonstrating improved ovarian histology and decreased apoptosis in animal models, it is recommended that a comprehensive clinical evaluation be pursued. This evaluation should include mechanistic studies focusing on the cAMP/PKA-dependent activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in ovarian granulosa cells and assessment of NFκB-mediated inflammatory responses to ensure that the hypothesized benefits can be realized in the human PCOS population (Devin et al., 2020; Yadegari, 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Sitagliptin demonstrates considerable promise as a repurposed drug candidate for PCOS treatment. Its long history of safe use in type 2 diabetes, coupled with its clear mechanism of action that involves elevation of GLP-1 levels, points to a potential therapeutic benefit in improving insulin sensitivity, reducing visceral adiposity, and possibly restoring normal ovarian function in PCOS patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). The strengths of this candidate include its well-defined pharmacological profile, the convergence of metabolic and reproductive benefits through incretin enhancement, and the convenience of oral administration that favors patient adherence (Devin et al., 2020; Ferjan et al., 2017).

However, potential weaknesses arise from the need for more direct evidence linking sitagliptin’s biochemical actions specifically to improved ovarian granulosa cell function and reduced NFκB-mediated inflammation in a clinical PCOS context (Daneshjou et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). Additionally, while metabolic improvements in glucose handling and visceral adiposity have been consistently observed, the translational impact on fertility and ovulatory function in PCOS remains to be definitively established (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Daneshjou et al., 2021). In light of these considerations, further mechanistic and clinical studies are warranted to fully validate sitagliptin’s efficacy in PCOS and to clarify the intracellular signaling dynamics in ovarian tissues (Liu et al., 2024; Mukherjee et al., 2023).

In conclusion, sitagliptin has a robust scientific foundation supporting its potential repurposing for PCOS. Its mechanism via DPP-4 inhibition and consequent elevation of endogenous GLP-1 suggests a beneficial role in enhancing insulin sensitivity through cAMP/PKA-dependent amplification of PI3K/Akt signaling and possible attenuation of NFκB-driven inflammation, which are critical processes implicated in the pathogenesis of PCOS (Khan et al., 2022; Devin et al., 2020). The candidate’s favorable safety profile, extensive clinical history in diabetes, and emerging preclinical data in PCOS models make it an attractive drug candidate worthy of further investigation in controlled clinical trials that specifically target the ovarian and reproductive endpoints of PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Etrusco et al., 2024).
