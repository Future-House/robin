Proposal for Bardoxolone methyl (Reata Pharmaceuticals; Nrf2 activator)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Bardoxolone methyl is a synthetic triterpenoid derived from natural oleanolic acid, a compound originally isolated from olive oil and medicinal plants such as Salvia. Chemically, it belongs to the class of synthetic oleanane triterpenoids that have been modified to enhance bioactivity through improved potency and pharmacokinetic characteristics. Bardoxolone methyl was designed via synthetic medicinal chemistry methods to bolster the innate antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties inherent in its natural precursor. This design strategy incorporates modifications that allow the drug to activate the transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2) robustly, thereby upregulating genes involved in cytoprotection and detoxification (Al-Sawaf et al., 2015; Camer et al., 2015).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, bardoxolone methyl has been primarily developed and evaluated in the contexts of chronic kidney disease (CKD), type 2 diabetes, and various forms of cancer. Several clinical trials have assessed its renal and metabolic benefits in patients with diabetic nephropathy and CKD, where its effects on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were documented. In oncology, early-phase clinical studies demonstrated that bardoxolone methyl modulated inflammatory pathways and exerted anticancer effects by inhibiting NF-κB signaling and inducing differentiation in tumor cells (Hong et al., 2012). Importantly, searches on ClinicalTrials.gov combining “Bardoxolone methyl OR Nrf2 activator” with terms such as “Polycystic Ovary Syndrome OR PCOS OR insulin resistance OR oxidative stress” have identified 33 clinical studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although bardoxolone methyl has not been directly used as a standard treatment in PCOS, its prominent use in diseases characterized by oxidative stress and metabolic dysregulation suggests potential applicability. Its insulin-sensitizing effects observed in metabolic disorders and improvements in renal function from clinical trials are promising indicators for drug repurposing in PCOS, a condition where oxidative stress and insulin resistance form key pathogenic mechanisms (Hai & Wang, 2011; Yagishita et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
Bardoxolone methyl’s principal mechanism of action involves the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytosol by Keap1, which tags it for proteasomal degradation. Bardoxolone methyl disrupts this interaction by electrophilically modifying cysteine residues on Keap1, thereby releasing Nrf2 from its repressor. Once liberated, Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of target genes. This induces the expression of numerous cytoprotective and antioxidant enzymes, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), superoxide dismutases, and various phase II detoxification enzymes (Al-Sawaf et al., 2015; Yagishita et al., 2020).

In addition to elevating antioxidant defenses, bardoxolone methyl inhibits NF-κB signaling, partly by direct inhibition of IKKβ. This dual action reduces the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and suppresses inflammatory kinase cascades such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Since increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate proinflammatory signals including JNK, the reduction of ROS through Nrf2 activation decreases the serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). This is crucial because serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 impairs its ability to propagate insulin signals via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which is integral to cellular glucose uptake (Dinh et al., 2015; Hong et al., 2012). Moreover, preclinical studies, including those performed in rodent high-fat diet models, have demonstrated that bardoxolone methyl can prevent hepatic steatosis and improve insulin sensitivity through these antioxidative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms (Camer et al., 2015). These molecular interactions are directly relevant to the pathophysiology of PCOS, where oxidative stress and disrupted insulin signaling in ovarian granulosa cells lead to metabolic dysfunction and reproductive disturbances (Al-Sawaf et al., 2015).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing bardoxolone methyl in the context of PCOS focuses on its ability to activate Nrf2 in ovarian granulosa cells. In these cells, enhanced Nrf2 activity is expected to upregulate a suite of antioxidant and detoxification genes, thereby reducing intra-cellular levels of reactive oxygen species and restoring redox balance (Al-Sawaf et al., 2015; Ogiso et al., 2022). The resultant attenuation of oxidative stress is anticipated to suppress the activation of stress-related kinases such as JNK. Since JNK is known to phosphorylate IRS-1 on serine residues, its suppression should reduce inhibitory phosphorylation of IRS-1. This is expected to restore the functionality of IRS-1, allowing for proper activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and subsequent glucose uptake into granulosa cells (Hai & Wang, 2011). Consequently, by mitigating these disruptions in insulin signaling, bardoxolone methyl could improve the metabolic environment within the ovary, potentially correcting insulin resistance that is often observed in PCOS patients. In support, various studies in diabetic and high-fat diet models have indicated that bardoxolone methyl improves insulin sensitivity and reduces features of metabolic syndrome by modulating these pathways (Camer et al., 2015; Dinh et al., 2015). Furthermore, the expression of Nrf2 and its downstream targets in ovarian tissue has been documented, bolstering the rationale that pharmacological activation can impact these cells directly (Yagishita et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
Bardoxolone methyl presents a compelling therapeutic candidate for repurposing in PCOS based on its well-documented mechanism of activating Nrf2 and simultaneously dampening proinflammatory signaling. One of its major strengths lies in its dual mode of action: by inducing antioxidant genes and suppressing NF-κB and JNK pathways, it offers a multifaceted approach to address both oxidative stress and insulin resistance, two core pathophysiological features of PCOS (Hong et al., 2012; Yagishita et al., 2020). Additionally, the existence of nearly 33 clinical trials exploring Nrf2 activators in metabolic, inflammatory, and oxidative stress-related contexts—although not exclusively in PCOS—supports the translational potential of this approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, there are notable challenges that must be considered. Firstly, while the preclinical and clinical data in other disease models are promising, direct evidence of efficacy in PCOS is limited. Ovarian granulosa cells have specific hormonal and paracrine architectures that may respond differently to Nrf2 modulation compared to renal or hepatic cells. The precise dosing regimen and long-term safety profile in a younger, predominantly female population—typical of PCOS patients—would need systematic evaluation. Some clinical trials of bardoxolone methyl in CKD have reported adverse events, including transient liver enzyme elevations and cardiovascular concerns in certain high-risk populations, which necessitates cautious patient selection and monitoring (Sakashita et al., 2021; de Zeeuw et al., 2013).

A further consideration is the balance between achieving sufficient Nrf2 activation to confer metabolic benefits and avoiding overactivation that could lead to undesired effects. For instance, excessive antioxidant activity might interfere with necessary redox signaling, which plays roles in normal cellular function and immune responses (Al-Sawaf et al., 2015). Moreover, it is critical to note that while bardoxolone methyl has shown insulin-sensitizing and cytoprotective properties in preclinical models, the complexity of PCOS—which encompasses hormonal dysregulation, reproductive dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances—may require combination approaches or adjunctive therapies to achieve optimal clinical outcomes (Dinh et al., 2015; Hong et al., 2012).

In summary, bardoxolone methyl is a well-characterized Nrf2 activator with a robust mechanistic rationale for repurposing in PCOS. Its ability to upregulate antioxidant defenses, suppress inflammatory signaling pathways, ameliorate oxidative stress-induced insulin resistance, and restore normal insulin receptor signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway is directly aligned with the therapeutic needs in PCOS granulosa cells (Hai & Wang, 2011; Camer et al., 2015). The repurposing strategy is further supported by extensive clinical trial data demonstrating manageable safety and favorable pharmacokinetics in other disease contexts. Nevertheless, targeted investigations specifically in PCOS models are essential to validate the hypothesis, determine optimal dosing, and fully understand the impact on ovarian physiology. Strengths of this candidate include its dual antioxidant and anti-inflammatory profile, known clinical data, and the strategic targeting of a critical pathway implicated in PCOS pathogenesis. Weaknesses or challenges include the need for careful adjustment of dosing in the reproductive-age population, potential adverse effects observed in other populations, and the requirement to translate findings from renal and cancer studies to the unique environment of ovarian granulosa cells (Dinh et al., 2015; Hong et al., 2012).

Overall, the evidence supports that bardoxolone methyl is a promising candidate for repurposing in PCOS due to its established Nrf2-dependent mechanism of action and its associated metabolic and insulin-sensitizing effects. Further focused preclinical studies and carefully designed clinical trials in PCOS patient populations are warranted to fully elucidate its utility in this indication (Yagishita et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
