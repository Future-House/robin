Proposal for Dapagliflozin (AstraZeneca; SGLT2 inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dapagliflozin is a synthetic, orally available small‐molecule inhibitor belonging to the sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor class developed originally for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This compound was discovered and optimized by AstraZeneca through a series of medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at deriving molecules capable of selectively inhibiting SGLT2, the transporter responsible for approximately 90% of renal glucose reabsorption. By competitively inhibiting the SGLT2 protein in the proximal renal tubule, dapagliflozin promotes glycosuria and thereby lowers plasma glucose levels via an insulin-independent mechanism (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Because its mechanism does not rely on pancreatic insulin secretion, dapagliflozin effectively reduces hyperglycemia even in patients with impaired beta-cell function. Over the years, dapagliflozin and its molecular family have been widely utilized to improve glycemic control in diabetic populations, as well as to confer additional cardioprotective and renoprotective benefits. The compound’s well-defined pharmacokinetics, including high oral bioavailability and a favorable once-daily dosing profile, make it an attractive candidate for repurposing into other metabolic conditions. In the case of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), there is a theoretical rationale whereby reducing systemic hyperinsulinemia with dapagliflozin may indirectly normalize ovarian steroidogenesis—a promising avenue given the limitations of existing therapies (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Rakic et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Dapagliflozin’s initial therapeutic use was in T2DM, where its role in reducing renal glucose reabsorption led to substantial glycemic benefits along with weight loss, reduced blood pressure, and decreased cardiovascular risk. Extensive clinical trials in diabetic populations have established its safety profile, delineating common adverse events such as genital mycotic infections and the very rare occurrences of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. Its clinical utility has also been extended to patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease, owing to its ability to favorably modify metabolic and hemodynamic parameters (Pruett et al., 2023). More recently, emerging clinical observations have indicated that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors in PCOS patients is accompanied by reductions in insulin resistance as measured by HOMA-IR, modest weight reduction, and improvements in androgen profiles—findings that parallel those observed with established agents such as metformin (Mrabet et al., 2024). Clinical trials conducted in women with PCOS, such as those registered under ClinicalTrials.gov (2016) and ClinicalTrials.gov (2024), have investigated combinations of dapagliflozin with other agents, as well as dapagliflozin monotherapy, to assess its impact on metabolic, endocrine, and reproductive endpoints. These trials have reported promising trends in improved insulin sensitivity and favorable changes in body composition, although the available data remain preliminary (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024). There is also supportive evidence from systematic reviews and small randomized trials that have compared dapagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors with metformin and GLP-1 receptor agonists in women with PCOS, indicating that the class effect might indeed offer benefits in managing hyperinsulinemia-driven hyperandrogenism, despite inter-study variability (Mrabet et al., 2024; Marinkovic-Radosevic et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
The therapeutic benefit of dapagliflozin is fundamentally rooted in its ability to inhibit the SGLT2 protein in the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney. At the molecular level, dapagliflozin binds to SGLT2 with high affinity and selectivity, thereby preventing the reabsorption of filtered glucose. This inhibition results in increased urinary glucose excretion (glycosuria), leading to a reduction in plasma glucose levels independently of insulin release. The ensuing reduction in blood glucose also diminishes the compensatory hyperinsulinemia that is a hallmark not only of T2DM but also of PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Unknown Reference).

In PCOS, hyperinsulinemia is a critical driver of ovarian dysfunction. Insulin directly augments the synthesis of androgens by stimulating the ovarian theca cells through activation of the insulin receptor and its downstream signaling cascades. Of particular note is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which is essential for insulin-mediated glucose uptake in granulosa cells. In the hyperinsulinemic state commonly seen in PCOS, granulosa cells exhibit impaired insulin receptor (IR) sensitivity and diminished PI3K/Akt pathway activation, leading to suboptimal glucose uptake and follicular dysfunction (Rakic et al., 2023).

By reducing plasma insulin levels, dapagliflozin theoretically interrupts this pathological loop. A decrease in systemic hyperinsulinemia should translate into reduced insulin-mediated stimulation of the ovarian theca cells, thus lowering androgen production. Concurrently, lower circulating insulin levels may alleviate the chronic overstimulation of granulosa cells, promoting restoration of normal insulin receptor sensitivity and reactivation of the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade required for proper follicular development and ovulation (Rakic et al., 2023; Mrabet et al., 2024). Furthermore, preclinical studies, such as those conducted in rodent models, have provided evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors can mitigate inflammation and improve mitochondrial function in tissues relevant to metabolic control, which indirectly supports ovarian metabolic health (Zhang et al., 2024). Although direct molecular evidence detailing the effects of dapagliflozin on the ovarian theca and granulosa cells remains sparse, the compound’s established metabolic actions and animal model findings strongly suggest potential downstream restoration of normal ovarian insulin signaling—particularly via PI3K/Akt pathways (Rakic et al., 2023).

Expected Effect:
In the context of the proposed hypothesis, the expected effect of dapagliflozin in PCOS centers on its ability to diminish systemic hyperinsulinemia, thereby decreasing insulin-driven androgen production in theca cells. As insulin acts synergistically with luteinizing hormone (LH) to stimulate theca cell steroidogenesis, a reduction in circulating insulin should theoretically lead to lower levels of circulating androgens, including total testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) (Mrabet et al., 2024; Rakic et al., 2023). In clinical settings, patients with PCOS treated with SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated improvements in metabolic parameters such as body weight reduction and enhanced insulin sensitivity, reflected in improved HOMA-IR scores. These metabolic benefits are anticipated to translate into endocrine improvements; specifically, lower insulin concentrations may reduce the hyperstimulation of ovarian theca cells, thereby decreasing androgen excess—a central driver of both reproductive and metabolic dysfunction in PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Mrabet et al., 2024).

The indirect effect on granulosa cells is equally significant. Granulosa cells in PCOS have been documented to show impaired insulin action due to decreased sensitivity of the insulin receptor and disrupted PI3K/Akt signaling, which is responsible for glucose uptake necessary for follicular maturation. With dapagliflozin lowering systemic insulin levels, it is expected that the insulin receptors on granulosa cells may regain their responsiveness. Re-establishing normal PI3K/Akt-mediated glucose uptake is critical for restoring follicular function and thereby improving ovulation and menstrual regularity (Rakic et al., 2023). In animal models, improvements in ovulatory function and normalized LH secretion have been observed with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, lending further support to the expected reproductive benefits in PCOS (Zhang et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025). Thus, the overall expected effects of dapagliflozin in PCOS are dual-pronged: targeting the metabolic derangements by reducing hyperinsulinemia and weight, while also addressing the reproductive dysfunction by indirectly reducing androgen production and restoring granulosa cell insulin sensitivity.

Overall Evaluation:
Dapagliflozin emerges as a promising repurposing candidate for the treatment of PCOS on several fronts. The strengths of this therapeutic candidate include its established mechanism of action, well-characterized safety and pharmacokinetic profile, and documented beneficial effects on glycemic control and weight reduction in diabetic populations. The compound’s insulin-independent mode of action—mediated via SGLT2 inhibition—effectively lowers plasma glucose and, consequently, plasma insulin levels. In PCOS, where hyperinsulinemia is a major pathogenic driver of both metabolic and reproductive dysfunction, this reduction has the potential to decrease insulin-mediated androgen synthesis in ovarian theca cells, which is a unique mechanism compared to existing insulin sensitizers such as metformin (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Rakic et al., 2023).

Additionally, clinical trials and systematic reviews have provided preliminary evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin, are associated with improvements in metabolic parameters such as weight loss and HOMA-IR indices in PCOS patients (Mrabet et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024). These metabolic improvements are significant, as they address the underlying insulin resistance that not only contributes to hyperandrogenism but also predisposes patients to long-term cardiovascular and metabolic disease. The cardiometabolic benefits observed with dapagliflozin in other patient cohorts further strengthen the rationale for its use in PCOS, a condition that carries an increased risk for cardiovascular complications (Pruett et al., 2023).

Mechanistically, while direct evidence of dapagliflozin’s effects on ovarian cellular signaling (specifically regarding the PI3K/Akt pathway in granulosa cells) remains limited, the overall rationale is compelling. By lowering systemic insulin levels, dapagliflozin should alleviate the excessive activation of insulin receptors on ovarian theca cells, thereby reducing the insulin-mediated overproduction of androgens—a key factor in PCOS pathogenesis. Furthermore, improved insulin sensitivity in granulosa cells could restore normal glucose uptake and follicular maturation, potentially improving ovulatory function and menstrual regularity (Rakic et al., 2023; Mrabet et al., 2024). Preclinical models offer supportive evidence for these effects, though more direct studies in human ovarian cells are needed.

On the safety side, dapagliflozin’s adverse event profile is well known from its use in T2DM, with common issues being manageable genitourinary infections and rare occurrences of ketoacidosis. Given that the metabolic and endocrine dysfunctions in PCOS overlap significantly with those seen in diabetic populations, the favorable safety profile in the latter provides confidence for repurposing—provided that vigilance is maintained for any differential effects in a reproductive-aged, non-diabetic population (Rakic et al., 2023; Mrabet et al., 2024).

However, there are several weaknesses and uncertainties associated with dapagliflozin’s repurposing for PCOS. The number of well-powered, long-term clinical trials investigating its impact specifically on reproductive endpoints in PCOS patients is limited. Existing studies often comprise small sample sizes and show variability in hormonal outcomes, with some trials reporting nonsignificant changes in hyperandrogenism when compared to established treatments like metformin (Mrabet et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Another concern is the lack of direct mechanistic studies in ovarian tissues, leaving a gap in our understanding of how effectively dapagliflozin may restore insulin receptor function and PI3K/Akt signaling in granulosa cells. This mechanistic gap necessitates further preclinical research to clearly demonstrate its impact at the cellular level (Rakic et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2025).

Additionally, clinical heterogeneity in PCOS—stemming from variable diagnostic criteria (Rotterdam versus NIH), patient BMI, baseline insulin resistance, and differences in metabolic phenotypes—could influence the response to dapagliflozin. Thus, while the hypothesized benefits are promising, careful patient selection and stratification will be essential for any clinical trial evaluating this candidate in PCOS. Furthermore, while the overall safety profile is positive, special consideration must be given to the potential reproductive and long-term endocrine effects in a population where fertility and ovarian function are of paramount concern (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Mrabet et al., 2024).

In summary, dapagliflozin represents a potentially transformative therapeutic candidate for PCOS, leveraging its ability to reduce systemic hyperinsulinemia and thereby address a central pathogenetic mechanism of the syndrome. Its strengths lie in its proven metabolic benefits, robust safety record in diabetes and heart failure populations, and the clear biochemical rationale linking insulin reduction to decreased ovarian androgen production and improved insulin sensitivity in granulosa cells. Weaknesses include the current paucity of direct mechanistic data in ovarian tissue, variability in clinical outcomes from early studies, and the need for larger, well-controlled clinical trials to firmly establish its efficacy and safety specific to PCOS. Given these considerations, dapagliflozin is a promising candidate that warrants further targeted investigation both preclinically and clinically to validate its role as a repurposed treatment for PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Mrabet et al., 2024; Rakic et al., 2023; Pruett et al., 2023).
