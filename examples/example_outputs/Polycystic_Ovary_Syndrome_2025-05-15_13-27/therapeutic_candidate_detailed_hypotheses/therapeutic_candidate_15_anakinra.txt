Proposal for Anakinra (Kineret; IL-1 receptor antagonist)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Anakinra, marketed as Kineret, is a recombinant formulation of the endogenous interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) originally isolated from human urine and later produced via recombinant DNA technology. It belongs to the class of biologic anti-inflammatory compounds designed to inhibit interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling. This drug was discovered based on the observation that a naturally occurring inhibitor of IL-1 could counteract the deleterious effects of excessive IL-1 activity in inflammatory diseases. Anakinra is synthesized recombinantly in Escherichia coli and subsequently purified, maintaining the crucial non-glycosylated structure similar to the native IL-1 receptor antagonist. Biologically, the compound functions by binding competitively to the interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1), effectively blocking the binding of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β, thereby mitigating downstream inflammatory signaling cascades. This therapeutic class, cytokine blockers, has been widely used for treating chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, and other autoinflammatory disorders, and has additionally found applications in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes by addressing IL-1–driven systemic inflammation (Popovic, 2021; Dinarello, 2014).

Therapeutic History:
Anakinra has an extensive therapeutic history, initially approved for rheumatoid arthritis and several autoinflammatory conditions. Its clinical efficacy in damping inflammatory responses has been demonstrated by its ability to lower systemic inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and to improve overall clinical symptoms in patients with these conditions (Popovic, 2021; Cavalli & Dinarello, 2018). Clinical trials have also explored its role in metabolic diseases, notably in type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, where IL-1–mediated inflammation contributes to islet β-cell demise and insulin resistance. Recent clinical investigations have even extended to repurposing anakinra in conditions characterized by low-grade chronic inflammation and insulin resistance, such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). In fact, emerging clinical trial data, including the FertIL trial (NCT03578497), have assessed the effects of IL-1 receptor antagonism in women with PCOS, indicating that while systemic inflammation is reduced, changes in hyperandrogenemia and ovarian steroidogenesis are more complex (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; Popovic, 2021). Although the direct application of anakinra in PCOS has not yet been widely adopted, preclinical and early clinical findings suggest a promising potential for this drug candidate in modulating ovarian inflammation and possibly improving insulin sensitivity in PCOS patients (Popovic, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
Anakinra exerts its therapeutic action by mimicking the biological activity of the natural interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. At a molecular level, anakinra binds to IL-1R1 with high affinity, thereby preventing IL-1β—and to a lesser extent, IL-1α—from engaging its receptor. The binding of IL-1β to its receptor normally initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling events mediated by adaptor proteins such as MyD88, leading to the activation of inflammatory kinases including IκB kinase (IKK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). These kinases then stimulate transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP-1, which promote the transcription of numerous inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other mediators that exacerbate insulin resistance and tissue inflammation (Dinarello, 2011; Cavalli & Dinarello, 2018). By blocking IL-1R1, anakinra effectively interrupts this signaling pathway, thereby reducing the phosphorylation and activation of downstream kinases like IKK and JNK. In the context of ovarian tissue, where IL-1β is known to be elevated in the follicular fluid and to influence both granulosa and theca cell function, this blockade is expected to diminish serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). This reduction is critical because abnormal IRS-1 serine phosphorylation is a well-recognized mechanism that impairs insulin receptor signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway, ultimately leading to reduced glucose uptake. In summary, the biochemical and molecular interactions of anakinra involve antagonizing the detrimental effects of IL-1β-driven inflammation by preventing the initiation of inflammatory kinase cascades and preserving normal insulin signaling (Dinarello, 2014; Cavalli & Dinarello, 2018; Popovic, 2021).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the repurposing of anakinra in PCOS is that blockade of IL-1 signaling in ovarian tissues will attenuate the inflammatory milieu that contributes to insulin resistance within the ovary. Specifically, in PCOS, IL-1β is elevated in the follicular fluid, where it can stimulate inflammatory responses that activate kinases such as JNK and IKK. These kinases subsequently phosphorylate IRS-1 on serine residues, thereby inhibiting the normal insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway that is essential for glucose uptake. In an in vitro ovarian cell culture assay involving granulosa and theca cells, it is expected that anakinra will reduce the activity of these inflammatory kinases. This effect should, in turn, lead to a decrease in aberrant IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, thereby preserving or even enhancing the downstream signaling cascade mediated by the insulin receptor, PI3K, and Akt. This improvement in insulin signal transduction will likely promote increased translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane and facilitate greater glucose uptake, which is important for normal cellular function in both granulosa and theca cells. The gene expression profiles of these ovarian cells show that components of the insulin signaling cascade, including IRS-1, PI3K, and Akt, are physiologically expressed and crucial for steroidogenesis and metabolic regulation; hence, targeting IL-1 mediated inflammation with anakinra could positively influence these processes (Popovic, 2021; Yang et al., 2019). Moreover, reduction in local inflammation is anticipated to improve overall ovarian function, which may help restore normal folliculogenesis and ovulatory patterns in women with PCOS, addressing both metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions.

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating anakinra as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for PCOS, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. One of the primary strengths is the well-documented role of IL-1β in driving inflammatory processes that contribute to systemic and tissue-specific insulin resistance. Given that PCOS is often characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, particularly in ovarian tissues where IL-1β is elevated, targeting this cytokine represents a scientifically valid approach to ameliorate ovarian insulin resistance. The extensive therapeutic history of anakinra in other inflammatory and metabolic conditions, along with its established pharmacokinetic and safety profile, reinforces its candidacy for repurposing (Popovic, 2021; Dinarello, 2014). Additionally, the proposed mechanism of action—whereby anakinra is expected to reduce inflammatory kinase activation (JNK, IKK), decrease IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, and preserve insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt signaling—is well supported by prior biochemical studies demonstrating the central role of IL-1β in these processes (Dinarello, 2011; Cavalli & Dinarello, 2018).

A significant advantage is that anakinra has already been evaluated in related metabolic contexts and has shown beneficial effects on inflammatory markers and beta-cell function in type 2 diabetes, even if systemic insulin sensitivity improvements were modest (van Asseldonk et al., 2011). This suggests that its anti-inflammatory effects can translate into measurable metabolic improvements. The novel aspect of this repurposing strategy involves applying anakinra directly to ovarian cell cultures, such as granulosa and theca cells, wherein the inflammatory isoforms of IL-1β contribute to local insulin resistance—a mechanism that has not yet been thoroughly explored but represents a compelling therapeutic target (Popovic, 2021).

However, there are weaknesses and challenges that warrant careful consideration. The clinical trial data evaluating anakinra in PCOS are still preliminary, and the FertIL trial (NCT03578497) has shown that while systemic inflammatory markers like CRP are reduced, the effects on ovarian steroidogenesis and androgen levels are not straightforward. In some cases, transient increases in androgens have been observed, suggesting that IL-1 blockade might have complex effects on ovarian endocrine function (Popovic, 2021). This complexity underscores the need for longer-duration studies and a more nuanced understanding of IL-1 signaling in ovarian physiology.

Furthermore, while the biochemical rationale for improved insulin signaling via reduced phosphorylation of IRS-1 is convincing, direct in vitro studies using ovarian cell cultures are currently limited. It remains to be established whether the suppression of inflammatory kinase activity by anakinra will translate robustly into enhanced PI3K/Akt activity and glucose uptake in granulosa and theca cells. Additional mechanistic studies examining the downstream effects of IL-1 blockade on insulin signaling components in ovarian tissue are necessary to validate the expected effects (Popovic, 2021; Yang et al., 2019).

Another potential limitation is related to the pharmacodynamics of anakinra. Its short half-life necessitates daily subcutaneous injections, which might pose challenges for long-term compliance in a chronic condition like PCOS. Moreover, injection site reactions have been observed in clinical studies, which could limit its tolerability or affect overall efficacy, particularly if such reactions lead to incomplete IL-1 blockade or rebound inflammatory responses (Popovic, 2021).

Overall, the repurposing of anakinra for PCOS is scientifically compelling, given the established role of IL-1β in mediating ovarian inflammation and insulin resistance. The candidate benefits from a robust therapeutic history, a well-understood mechanism of action, and indirect evidence of efficacy in metabolic disorders characterized by similar inflammatory processes. However, care must be taken in interpreting early clinical trial data and in designing further studies to address issues such as dosing duration, patient selection (ideally those with high baseline inflammatory markers), and detailed mechanistic endpoints in ovarian cell models.

In conclusion, while there are potential challenges—including the complexity of ovarian steroidogenesis modulation, dosing regimen concerns, and the need for direct in vitro data—the overall evaluation is positive. The hypothesis that anakinra blockade of IL-1 signaling in PCOS ovarian tissues can reduce activation of inflammatory kinases (JNK, IKK), decrease IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, and thereby enhance insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt-driven glucose uptake in cell types critical for ovarian function (granulosa and theca cells) is strongly supported by current scientific literature. This candidate presents a promising avenue for further research and clinical investigation as a novel therapeutic strategy to address inflammation-mediated insulin resistance in PCOS (Popovic, 2021; Dinarello, 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
