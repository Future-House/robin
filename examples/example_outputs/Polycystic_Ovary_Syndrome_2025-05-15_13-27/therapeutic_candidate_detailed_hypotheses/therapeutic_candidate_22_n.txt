Proposal for N-Acetylcysteine (NAC; Sigma-Aldrich catalog #A7250)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an acetylated derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid L-cysteine. Initially discovered for its mucolytic properties and later recognized for its potent antioxidant capacity, NAC is synthesized by acetylating cysteine, thereby increasing its stability, solubility, and oral bioavailability. As a member of the antioxidant and thiol donor class of drugs, NAC is widely used as an antidote in acetaminophen overdose due to its ability to replenish intracellular glutathione (GSH) and to directly scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). Its chemical structure, which includes a free sulfhydryl group, allows it to interact with electrophilic compounds and serve as a reducing agent. Over the years, the compound has been repurposed for various clinical applications including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver pathologies, and recently, endocrine and metabolic disorders such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) (Salehpour et al., 2009). This compound is commercially available; for example, Sigma-Aldrich catalog #A7250 supplies a standardized, pharmaceutical grade material that has been utilized in numerous preclinical and clinical studies. The class of antioxidant compounds to which NAC belongs has a long history of investigation in mitigating oxidative damage in various tissues, and its ability to serve as a glutathione precursor is central to its application in conditions where oxidative stress and inflammation play pathophysiological roles (Salehpour et al., 2009; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, NAC has been used for its mucolytic effects in respiratory disorders and as an effective antidote for acetaminophen toxicity due to its property of restoring glutathione levels in hepatic tissues. In recent decades, its use has expanded toward conditions characterized by heightened oxidative stress and inflammation. Clinical investigations have begun to explore its role in metabolic diseases, particularly in PCOS—a multifactorial endocrine disorder characterized by insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, and chronic low-grade inflammation. Several clinical trials have been registered to evaluate NAC in PCOS settings. For instance, the clinical study registered under NCT01008046 conducted by Mansoura University investigated NAC combined with clomiphene citrate (CC) in clomiphene-resistant PCOS patients, reporting improvements in ovulation rate and pregnancy outcomes (Mansoura University, 2007). Similarly, NCT02239107, conducted by Assiut University, evaluated NAC as an adjuvant therapy following laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) in clomiphene-resistant PCOS women, with favorable outcomes in terms of follicular development and ovulation (Badran, 2012). More recently, a trial registered as NCT06836128 compared combined NAC and metformin therapy versus metformin alone, showing promising effects on endocrine-metabolic markers and ovulatory function (Talat, 2025). In addition to these clinical studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have also summarized that NAC supplementation leads to improvements in insulin sensitivity, follicular development, and hormonal profiles in PCOS patients (Asl et al., 2023; Song et al., 2020). Moreover, comparative studies between NAC and the standard insulin-sensitizing agent metformin have indicated that NAC can exert comparable or even superior benefits in certain metabolic parameters while displaying an excellent safety profile and minimal adverse effects, thereby positioning NAC as a promising alternative or adjunctive therapy in PCOS management (Chandil et al., 2019; Salehpour et al., 2009). Overall, the therapeutic history of NAC demonstrates growing evidence of its repurposing for treating PCOS and related metabolic disturbances, supported by preclinical findings, small-scale clinical trials, and meta-analytical reviews that collectively encourage further investigation (Mansoura University, 2007; Badran, 2012; Talat, 2025; Salehpour et al., 2009; Chandil et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
The principal mechanism of action of NAC involves its capacity to restore intracellular antioxidant defense by serving as a precursor for glutathione synthesis. Glutathione, a critical tripeptide, is essential for neutralizing reactive oxygen species and maintaining redox balance within cells. In the context of PCOS, oxidative stress has been implicated as a major contributor to insulin resistance, particularly in ovarian granulosa cells. This oxidative stress can lead to the activation of stress-activated protein kinases such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and IκB kinase (IKK). Activation of these kinases results in the serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), which impairs its ability to mediate downstream insulin signaling via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway (Askari, 2019). In a normal insulin signaling cascade, IRS-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues which facilitates the binding and activation of PI3K, thereby promoting Akt phosphorylation and downstream signaling events. One key downstream effect is the translocation of the glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane, a crucial step for glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues such as skeletal muscle and, importantly, ovarian granulosa cells. Impairments in this pathway contribute to insulin resistance—a hallmark of PCOS. NAC, by reducing ROS levels, directly scavenges free radicals and reinstates a reduced intracellular environment conducive to proper IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation rather than the inhibitory serine phosphorylation induced by JNK and IKK activation (Cheraghi et al., 2017; Salehpour et al., 2009). Restoration of the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt signaling cascade improves GLUT4 translocation and enhances cellular glucose uptake (Fang et al., 2024; Rafiee et al., 2022). Although some studies have not directly measured molecular endpoints such as JNK or IKK phosphorylation in granulosa cells in clinical settings, the overall biochemical evidence supports that NAC exerts its beneficial metabolic effects via these redox-sensitive pathways (Fang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). In summary, NAC’s mechanism is multifaceted: it replenishes glutathione, quenches ROS, downregulates stress kinase activity (JNK, IKK), reduces aberrant IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, and restores insulin receptor signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway—ultimately ensuring effective GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues (Askari, 2019; Cheraghi et al., 2017; Salehpour et al., 2009; Fang et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
Based on the proposed hypothesis, NAC is expected to exert a multifactorial therapeutic effect in PCOS through its antioxidant activity on ovarian granulosa cells. Specifically, by scavenging ROS and replenishing glutathione pools, NAC should lower the ROS-driven activation of JNK and IKK pathways. This reduction in oxidative stress-mediated kinase activity is anticipated to prevent the deleterious serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, thereby restoring proper tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade. With enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling, the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane is expected to improve, thus increasing glucose uptake in granulosa cells. Improved glucose uptake is critical because granulosa cell metabolic competence is directly linked to follicular development and successful ovulation. Several clinical studies in PCOS have correlated NAC supplementation with improved insulin sensitivity, decreased serum testosterone levels, and enhanced ovulatory rates. For instance, clinical trials such as those registered under NCT01008046 and NCT02239107 demonstrated that NAC, when administered in combination with clomiphene citrate, significantly enhanced ovulation and pregnancy rates in clomiphene-resistant PCOS patients (Mansoura University, 2007; Badran, 2012). Additionally, meta-analyses have indicated that NAC treatment results in favorable metabolic and hormonal shifts, including decreased fasting blood glucose, reduced hyperinsulinemia, and lowered total testosterone levels (Asl et al., 2023; Song et al., 2020). In vitro studies suggest that granulosa cells express high levels of the insulin signaling components such as IRS-1, PI3K, and GLUT4, and these are precisely the molecules that the NAC-mediated antioxidant mechanism is aimed to normalize (Fang et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
The accumulated evidence indicates that NAC is a promising therapeutic candidate for PCOS. Among its notable strengths is its excellent safety profile, low cost, and established oral bioavailability. The mechanism of action, which centers on reducing oxidative stress and improving insulin signaling, directly addresses a validated component of PCOS pathophysiology. Clinical trials (e.g., NCT01008046, NCT02239107, NCT06836128) have provided encouraging preliminary data, demonstrating that NAC supplementation can enhance ovulatory function and improve metabolic and hormonal parameters in PCOS patients. These findings are supported by biochemical studies that elucidate how NAC replenishes glutathione and attenuates stress kinase activity, thereby restoring the normal insulin receptor signaling cascade necessary for GLUT4 translocation and cellular glucose uptake (Salehpour et al., 2009; Askari, 2019; Fang et al., 2024).

However, several weaknesses remain. While the preclinical and early clinical data are compelling, many studies have been conducted in relatively small and heterogeneous populations, and longer-term trials are needed to fully establish the efficacy and safety of NAC as a monotherapy or as an adjuvant treatment in PCOS. There is also some variability in the reported outcomes, and the detailed molecular mechanisms in human ovarian tissue, particularly concerning the specific modulation of JNK and IKK pathways, need further elucidation. In addition, although NAC appears to have beneficial effects when combined with other ovulation-inducing agents such as clomiphene citrate, its optimal dosing regimen and long-term impact on metabolic parameters require further research. Despite these limitations, the converging lines of evidence—from in vitro mechanistic studies to in vivo animal models and early-phase clinical trials—strongly support further investigation of NAC for PCOS. The drug candidate’s mechanistic specificity to redox-sensing pathways and its ability to address insulin resistance in granulosa cells offer a scientifically plausible and clinically relevant approach to managing the metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions observed in PCOS (Cheraghi et al., 2017; Song et al., 2020; Talat, 2025).

In conclusion, NAC represents a well-validated candidate for repurposing in the treatment of PCOS. The compound’s ability to reduce oxidative stress, improve insulin sensitivity, and restore normal ovarian function aligns well with the therapeutic needs in PCOS management. Its excellent safety profile, low cost, and oral dosing are additional practical advantages that support rapid clinical translation. Given the encouraging clinical trial signals and the robust mechanistic rationale, further large-scale, long-term randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm its efficacy and to optimize treatment protocols. Overall, NAC stands out as a promising agent with the potential to address both the metabolic and reproductive derangements in PCOS, making it a strong candidate for continued development and eventual clinical implementation in this patient population (Mansoura University, 2007; Badran, 2012; Asl et al., 2023; Song et al., 2020; Salehpour et al., 2009).
