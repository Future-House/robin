Proposal for Empagliflozin (Boehringer Ingelheim; SGLT2 inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Empagliflozin is a small molecule belonging to the sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor class, originally discovered and developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This compound was synthesized based on the principle of inhibiting the SGLT2 protein found in the proximal renal tubule, thereby reducing glucose reabsorption and promoting glycosuria. The development of SGLT2 inhibitors followed the observation that reducing renal glucose uptake could lower plasma glucose levels independent of insulin secretion. Empagliflozin, manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim, benefits from extensive clinical data regarding its pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). As a member of a class of antidiabetic agents that have been well characterized in diabetic and metabolic syndrome populations, empagliflozin has shown beneficial effects in terms of weight reduction, improvements in insulin sensitivity, and cardiovascular protection. Its high specificity for the SGLT2 isoform minimizes off‐target effects and contributes to a favorable safety profile in women. This background provides a suitable foundation to evaluate its repurposing for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) given the overlap in metabolic dysregulation, particularly hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, between T2DM and PCOS (Zhang et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Empagliflozin has a long history of clinical use in the treatment of T2DM and has been extensively studied in large-scale clinical trials, where it has been shown to improve glycemic control, reduce body weight, and decrease cardiovascular risk factors. Its use in patients with metabolic syndrome has also been well documented, and it has demonstrated consistent benefits in reducing hyperglycemia via glycosuria. In recent years, several clinical trials have begun to explore the repurposing of empagliflozin for conditions beyond T2DM. Notably, trials such as NCT03008551 and NCT05200793 have evaluated the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin, in women with PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). These studies focus on biochemical parameters such as fasting insulin levels, HOMA‐IR scores, and hormonal profiles, indicating that the drug not only induces weight loss but may also exert beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and circulating androgen levels in PCOS patients (Mahmoud et al., 2023, pp. 1–2; Marinkovic-Radosevic et al., 2021, pp. 2–4). Furthermore, meta-analytic data and preliminary clinical trial evidence have provided early indications that SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce hyperinsulinemia, a central feature of PCOS pathology (Mrabet et al., 2024, pp. 1–2).

Mechanism of Action:
The molecular mechanism of empagliflozin is well understood and centers on its inhibition of the SGLT2 protein in the kidney’s proximal tubules. SGLT2 is responsible for approximately 90% of renal glucose reabsorption; by inhibiting this transporter, empagliflozin induces glycosuria, which reduces blood glucose levels in an insulin-independent manner. The resultant decrease in plasma glucose concentration leads to a lower insulin demand from pancreatic β‐cells, consequently reducing systemic hyperinsulinemia. This is particularly relevant for PCOS, where hyperinsulinemia is known to exacerbate ovarian androgen production. In hyperinsulinemic states, excess insulin acts synergistically with luteinizing hormone (LH) to stimulate theca cell androgen production, while also reducing hepatic synthesis of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), thereby increasing free circulating testosterone. By mitigating hyperinsulinemia, empagliflozin indirectly diminishes these androgenogenic processes and may help restore insulin sensitivity in ovarian tissues, including granulosa cells.

At the molecular level, studies have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors such as empagliflozin improve insulin sensitivity not only systemically but also via modulation of intracellular signaling pathways. For instance, glucose removal via glycosuria is associated with reductions in glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity, conditions known to impair insulin receptor signaling. In animal models of PCOS, interventions with empagliflozin—alone or in combination with metformin—have been linked to upregulation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in ovarian tissue. Activation of the AMPK/SIRT1 axis is critical for improving mitochondrial function, reducing inflammatory cytokine production, and ultimately enhancing insulin signaling in target tissues such as ovarian granulosa cells (Mahmoud et al., 2023, pp. 12–13; Rakic et al., 2023, pp. 10–12). These molecular interactions are promising because insulin receptor desensitization in granulosa cells is implicated in abnormal ovarian glucose uptake and impaired follicular development in PCOS. In addition, empagliflozin’s metabolic actions include modest effects on body fat distribution, which may further improve the metabolic milieu pertinent to ovarian function (Marinkovic-Radosevic et al., 2021, pp. 6–8; Rakic et al., 2023, pp. 7–8). The drug’s pharmacokinetic profile, characterized by good oral bioavailability, predictable half-life, and renal clearance, supports its application in chronic diseases such as PCOS where long-term metabolic modulation is desired (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis that empagliflozin-induced glycosuria will reduce systemic hyperinsulinemia, the expected effect in PCOS patients is a reduction in insulin-driven ovarian androgen production. In PCOS, hyperinsulinemia not only increases androgen secretion by the ovaries but also contributes to ovarian insulin resistance by desensitizing insulin receptors on granulosa cells. The reduction in circulating insulin levels is anticipated to restore more normal insulin receptor function in these cells, enhancing their ability to uptake glucose effectively and potentially normalizing follicular development. Clinical trials have shown that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors leads to improvements in weight, insulin sensitivity measured by HOMA-IR, and reduced circulating insulin levels (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023). Preclinical studies further corroborate these findings, as combination therapy with metformin and empagliflozin in rat models of PCOS has demonstrated improvements in ovarian morphology—such as fewer cystic follicles and increased granulosa cell layer thickness—with concurrent reductions in circulating testosterone and inflammatory markers (Mahmoud et al., 2023, pp. 15–16; Marinkovic-Radosevic et al., 2021, pp. 4–5).

Moreover, by lowering systemic insulin, empagliflozin may indirectly affect the ovarian microenvironment by reducing the insulin–LH synergy that typically drives excessive androgen synthesis. This would result in reduced free androgen levels, due in part to an increase in SHBG production by the liver. Such changes would be beneficial in alleviating the clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism, including hirsutism, acne, and menstrual irregularities. On a cellular level, improvement in insulin signaling within granulosa cells may be reflected in enhanced glucose uptake and restored energy balance within ovarian follicles, thereby promoting normal oocyte maturation and ovulation (Mrabet et al., 2024, pp. 8–9; Rakic et al., 2023, pp. 8–9). Given that the expression of insulin receptors in ovarian granulosa cells is well documented, and considering that insulin signaling pathways are intricately involved in proper follicular development, the expected outcome is a dual benefit encompassing both systemic metabolic improvements and direct ovarian benefits.

Overall Evaluation:
Empagliflozin shows considerable promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for PCOS based on its well-defined pharmacologic actions in T2DM and metabolic syndrome. Its primary strength lies in its ability to reduce plasma glucose independently of insulin secretion and thereby lower systemic hyperinsulinemia. This reduction can have downstream benefits on ovarian androgen production, which is central to the pathophysiology of PCOS. Additionally, the favorable safety, PK/PD profiles, and extensive clinical experience in diabetic populations support its translational application in women with PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). Preclinical studies in PCOS animal models have provided encouraging data—showing that empagliflozin, especially when used in combination with metformin, can improve ovarian histology and reduce inflammatory markers that exacerbate PCOS pathology (Mahmoud et al., 2023, p. 17; Marinkovic-Radosevic et al., 2021, pp. 2–4).

However, several challenges remain. Although the mechanism of action in reducing hyperglycemia via SGLT2 inhibition is well established, direct evidence linking empagliflozin to improved granulosa cell insulin signaling and reduced ovarian androgen synthesis in humans is still limited. Most current studies come from T2DM cohorts or animal models, and while these provide a proof-of-concept, further dedicated clinical trials in PCOS populations are necessary to confirm efficacy and elucidate the detailed molecular effects on ovarian tissue. For instance, trials such as NCT03008551 and NCT06576375 are beginning to address these endpoints (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024).

Another potential weakness is that many of the anticipated benefits are indirect. While a reduction in hyperinsulinemia is expected to lessen ovarian androgen production via decreased insulin–LH synergy, the extent to which this mechanism translates to clinically meaningful improvements in ovulation and menstrual regulation remains to be fully determined. Additionally, while empagliflozin is known to produce consistent weight loss and metabolic improvements, its impact on inflammatory markers within the ovarian microenvironment is less clear, and inflammation remains a central component in PCOS pathogenesis. Some studies report that empagliflozin can reduce systemic inflammation through modulation of the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway, yet robust ovarian-specific data are lacking (Rakic et al., 2023, pp. 12–13; Mrabet et al., 2024, pp. 9–10).

Despite these shortcomings, the overall evaluation is cautiously optimistic. The indirect modulation of ovarian insulin resistance via systemic metabolic improvements represents an innovative strategy to tackle PCOS, a condition for which current therapeutic options are limited and often come with undesirable side effects. Empagliflozin’s well-established safety profile in women, along with its potential for dual benefits in both glycemic control and androgen regulation, underscores its attractiveness as a candidate for further investigation. The existing literature supports the rationale that lowering hyperinsulinemia through SGLT2 inhibition can effectively mitigate one of the key drivers of PCOS pathology, offering a novel approach that complements existing treatments such as metformin (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023; Marinkovic-Radosevic et al., 2021, pp. 1–2; Rakic et al., 2023, pp. 13–14).

In summary, empagliflozin presents a compelling candidate for repurposing in PCOS therapy. Its strengths include a robust mechanistic rationale based on glycosuria-induced reductions in systemic hyperinsulinemia, potential benefits on ovarian androgen synthesis, a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile in women, and supportive preclinical as well as early clinical trial data. The key weaknesses to be addressed in future research are the need for direct evidence of improved granulosa cell insulin signaling, more comprehensive assessments of ovarian hormonal changes, and the clarification of the molecular pathways within ovarian tissue that are influenced by this therapy. Overall, continued investment in clinical trials and mechanistic studies is warranted to validate empagliflozin as a therapeutic option for PCOS and to delineate the optimal treatment paradigms—alone or in combination with existing agents such as metformin—that may lead to improved reproductive and metabolic outcomes in this patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023; Mahmoud et al., 2023, pp. 1–2; Marinkovic-Radosevic et al., 2021, pp. 2–4; Rakic et al., 2023, pp. 7–8).
