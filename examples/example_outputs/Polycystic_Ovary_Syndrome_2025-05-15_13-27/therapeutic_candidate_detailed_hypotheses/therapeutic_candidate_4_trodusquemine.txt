Proposal for Trodusquemine (MSI-1436; Tocris Bioscience catalog #5993)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate: Trodusquemine (MSI‐1436) is a naturally derived aminosterol originally isolated from the dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias) and subsequently characterized for its multiple biomedical activities. Its discovery emanated from marine natural product research, where compounds such as squalamine and trodusquemine were identified for their unique structure comprising a steroid skeleton conjugated with a polyamine moiety. In trodusquemine the polyamine component is specifically a spermine side chain, which confers a higher positive charge relative to its close analogue squalamine, where a spermidine is present; this structural difference significantly enhances membrane interactions and impacts its biological function (Babak & Ahn, 2021; Barbut et al., 2024). Trodusquemine belongs to the aminosterol class of compounds—a group that has been historically investigated for antimicrobial, neuroprotective, and metabolic regulatory effects. Over time, this class has been repurposed and optimized to target key regulatory enzymes involved in metabolism, with trodusquemine emerging as a potent, selective, and reversible allosteric inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) (Kyriakou, 2017; Limbocker et al., 2022). Its manufacturing has been facilitated by both natural extraction and synthetic approaches that allow systematic chemical modifications in search of improved pharmacokinetic properties, an approach that has generated analogues like DPM-1001 with enhanced oral bioavailability while maintaining a similar mechanism of action (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Négrel & Brunel, 2021).

Therapeutic History: Biochemically, trodusquemine has been studied broadly in the context of obesity, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. Preclinical studies in rodents have shown that it acts to reduce food intake, bring about fat-specific weight loss, improve insulin sensitivity, and reverse hepatic steatosis by ameliorating insulin resistance at both peripheral and central levels, as documented in diet-induced obese and genetically obese mouse models (Lantz et al., 2010; Maccari & Ottanà, 2023). Its effectiveness in improving insulin receptor phosphorylation is attributed to its inhibition of PTP1B—a well-validated negative regulator of insulin and leptin signaling pathways—thus restoring downstream signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway (Barbut et al., 2024; He et al., 2012). Clinically, trodusquemine has been evaluated in Phase I trials primarily focused on type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, in which it demonstrated promising safety and pharmacokinetic profiles (Genaera Corporation, 2008; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, in oncology settings trodusquemine has been examined for its potential anticancer properties, particularly in HER2-positive breast cancer, given the role of PTP1B in tumorigenic signaling (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Kyriakou, 2017). Despite extensive investigation into its metabolic and neuroprotective benefits, there is no published record of trodusquemine being explicitly trialed for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) or ovarian insulin resistance; however, the shared metabolic derangements in insulin-resistant tissues suggest a promising opportunity to explore its efficacy in PCOS-related contexts (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action: The therapeutic mechanism of trodusquemine is rooted in its allosteric inhibition of PTP1B, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates insulin and leptin receptors, attenuating downstream metabolic signaling. Biochemical studies have precisely mapped its binding to non-catalytic regions of PTP1B, particularly involving the C-terminal helix α9 and a secondary site near helix α7, where its binding induces conformational changes that stabilize an inactive enzyme conformation (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Babak & Ahn, 2021). This allosteric mode of inhibition avoids the challenges encountered with active site-directed inhibitors that often suffer from poor bioavailability due to the highly charged nature of the catalytic site and the need for phosphotyrosine mimetics (He et al., 2012; Limbocker et al., 2022). In addition, trodusquemine interacts with cellular membranes due to its amphipathic and cationic nature, enabling it not only to modulate PTP1B activity in the cytosol but also to affect membrane properties, which may indirectly decrease insulin resistance by influencing receptor localization and function (Barbut et al., 2024; Capitini et al., 2022). On a molecular level, when PTP1B is inhibited, the insulin receptor (IR) remains phosphorylated for longer periods, thereby amplifying downstream PI3K/Akt signaling which is critical for glucose uptake mediated by GLUT4 translocation in insulin-sensitive tissues (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Lantz et al., 2010). This mechanism has been well documented in various in vivo and in vitro models where enhanced phosphorylation of the IR and downstream targets was observed after trodusquemine treatment (Barbut et al., 2024; Kyriakou, 2017). Given that insulin resistance is a central pathophysiological mechanism in PCOS, and that granulosa cells from PCOS ovaries exhibit altered insulin signaling with upregulated PTP1B activity, the hypothesized effect is well supported by the detailed biochemical interactions of trodusquemine (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Limbocker et al., 2019).

Expected Effect: The proposed hypothesis is that trodusquemine will selectively inhibit PTP1B in PCOS-derived granulosa cells, which should consequently enhance insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and activate downstream PI3K/Akt signaling. This cascade is expected to improve GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake, thereby alleviating ovarian insulin resistance—a critical component of PCOS pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical animal models and cell-based assays have already demonstrated that trodusquemine’s inhibition of PTP1B results in improved insulin sensitivity, reduced ER stress, and favorable metabolic outcomes, including significant weight loss and enhanced hepatic and muscle insulin signaling (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Barbut et al., 2024). In the specific case of PCOS, ovarian granulosa cells play a pivotal role in folliculogenesis and steroid hormone production, and dysregulation of insulin signaling in these cells is linked to aberrant follicle development and anovulation. By enhancing insulin receptor phosphorylation and promoting effective downstream signaling in these cells, trodusquemine could restore normal glucose handling and cellular metabolism, which would be a significant therapeutic advance for PCOS management (Barbut et al., 2024; Maccari & Ottanà, 2023). Furthermore, granulosa cells are known to express PTP1B, and its inhibition has been correlated with improved insulin sensitivity in other tissues; therefore, similar effects in granulosa cells can be anticipated based on these mechanistic findings (Kyriakou, 2017; Négrel & Brunel, 2021).

Overall Evaluation: In evaluating trodusquemine for repurposing in PCOS, several strengths and challenges emerge. Among the primary strengths is the robust evidence supporting trodusquemine’s role as a selective allosteric inhibitor of PTP1B, with a well-characterized mechanism of action that enhances insulin receptor signaling and downstream PI3K/Akt pathway activity. This property directly addresses the insulin resistance observed in PCOS ovarian tissues, as increased PTP1B activity is known to negatively impact insulin signaling (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Babak & Ahn, 2021). Additionally, the extensive preclinical studies demonstrating favorable safety, tolerability, and efficacy in metabolic disease models—combined with early-phase clinical trial data in obesity and diabetes—provide significant translational potential for trodusquemine in a new indication such as PCOS (Genaera Corporation, 2008; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The compound’s membrane-active properties and its ability to engage with intracellular targets effectively further support its potential to ameliorate complex metabolic dysfunctions in ovarian cells (Capitini et al., 2022; Barbut et al., 2024).

In terms of weaknesses, the primary gap in the current body of literature is the lack of direct evidence for trodusquemine’s efficacy in PCOS or ovarian insulin resistance specifically, with most studies focused on diabetes, obesity, and neurodegenerative conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Maccari & Ottanà, 2023). Moreover, the unique physiology of ovarian granulosa cells and their microenvironment may introduce nuances that differ from systemic or hepatic insulin resistance, necessitating dedicated studies to confirm the mechanistic hypothesis in this cell type (Barbut et al., 2024; Limbocker et al., 2022). There is also a need to elucidate the compound’s long-term effects on ovarian steroidogenesis and follicular development, as any negative impact on these processes could potentially limit its clinical utility in PCOS patients. Additionally, while the preclinical safety profile is encouraging, the translation of these findings to the ovarian context requires careful dose optimization and pharmacodynamic evaluation to avoid off-target effects or adverse impacts on reproductive function (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Kyriakou, 2017).

Overall, trodusquemine represents a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of PCOS, particularly given the crucial role of insulin resistance in the pathophysiology of the syndrome. Its selective allosteric inhibition of PTP1B is directly relevant to improving insulin receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling—a mechanism that, if successfully translated to PCOS-derived granulosa cells, could restore normal metabolic function and improve clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, further targeted preclinical studies using ovarian cell lines and in vivo PCOS models are essential to validate this hypothesis and define optimal therapeutic parameters. In conclusion, based on the extensive literature spanning its molecular discovery, biochemical characterization, and robust preclinical evaluation in related metabolic disorders, trodusquemine holds considerable potential as a novel therapeutic candidate for PCOS, albeit with the current caveat that direct ovarian studies are required to substantiate its effectiveness in this specific indication (Maccari & Ottanà, 2023; Barbut et al., 2024; Kyriakou, 2017).
