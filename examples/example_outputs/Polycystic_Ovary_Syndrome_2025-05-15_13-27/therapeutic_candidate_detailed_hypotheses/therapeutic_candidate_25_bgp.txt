Proposal for BGP-15 (N-desmethyltacrolimus; Active Biochem catalog #A-3010)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
BGP-15, also known as N-desmethyltacrolimus, is a small molecule pharmacological agent originally developed as an insulin sensitizer with a unique profile based on its ability to upregulate heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72). It is synthetically derived from tacrolimus by removal of a methyl group, resulting in a compound with distinct immunomodulatory and chaperone-inducing properties. As a nicotinic amidoxime derivative, BGP-15 belongs to a class of non-steroidal, low molecular weight compounds that modulate cellular stress responses via the heat shock pathway. The synthetic origins of BGP-15 involve modification of macrolide immunosuppressants to both reduce immunosuppressive activity and enhance its potential as a cytoprotective agent by promoting molecular chaperone expression. Within its class, these compounds have been explored primarily for their ability to protect cells against various metabolic stresses, improve mitochondrial physiology, and enhance insulin receptor signaling in different tissues. This approach—to repurpose an agent once investigated for ischemia–reperfusion injury and other stress‐related conditions for metabolic diseases such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)—demonstrates innovation in drug repurposing strategies by leveraging established safety and pharmacokinetic profiles obtained in earlier phase clinical studies (Artasensi, 2022; Pető et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, BGP-15 has undergone extensive preclinical evaluation in animal models of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and cardiac dysfunction. Preclinical studies in various rodent models—including Zucker obese, Goto-Kakizaki, and cholesterol-fed rabbits—have demonstrated its ability to improve insulin sensitivity and ameliorate metabolic disturbances, effects that are mediated in part by induction of Hsp72 and inhibition of stress kinases. Clinical phase II trials in insulin-resistant patients have established a favorable safety profile and predictable pharmacokinetics when administered orally, thereby supporting its continued development as an insulin sensitizer. Although BGP-15 has not been exclusively studied in a large cohort of PCOS patients, considerable indirect evidence exists from clinical trials that have evaluated metabolic endpoints relevant to PCOS—for example, improvements in glucose uptake and reductions in systemic inflammatory markers have been documented in populations with insulin resistance. The compound has also been investigated in contexts where atypical antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects were prominent, further highlighting its capacity to mitigate insulin resistance and dyslipidemia through Hsp72 induction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Literáti-Nagy et al., 2012; Pető et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of BGP-15 is multifaceted and centers on its ability to function as a heat shock protein co-inducer. At the molecular level, BGP-15 facilitates the stabilization and activity of heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1), which is the principal transcriptional activator of stress-inducible heat shock proteins such as Hsp72. Once induced, Hsp72 acts as a molecular chaperone that improves proteostasis by assisting in proper protein folding and by preventing the aggregation or degradation of critical proteins, such as components of the insulin receptor complex. Moreover, Hsp72 stabilizes the insulin receptor by protecting insulin receptor substrates from stress-induced degradation; this is crucial in tissues like the ovary where insulin signaling is required to maintain metabolic and endocrine balance. In addition to these chaperoning functions, BGP-15 has been shown to inhibit the activation of stress kinases, notably c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). JNK activation, which is typically elevated under conditions of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, promotes serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS), thereby inhibiting insulin signal transduction. By suppressing JNK activity, BGP-15 facilitates the preservation of IRS integrity and enables effective downstream signaling via the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. This signaling cascade is essential for the translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter to the plasma membrane—a step that is directly linked to insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Biochemical studies in animal models have demonstrated that by inducing Hsp72 and decreasing JNK activity, BGP-15 leads to enhanced GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface in insulin-responsive tissues, resulting in improved glucose uptake and overall metabolic homeostasis (Artasensi, 2022; Literáti-Nagy et al., 2014; Pető et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis in our proposal is that BGP-15 will induce Hsp72 in ovarian cells affected by PCOS, thereby stabilizing the insulin receptor and preventing its degradation under conditions of cellular stress. In PCOS, insulin resistance is a pivotal pathogenic feature that contributes to hyperinsulinemia and subsequent ovarian dysfunction, including aberrant androgen production. By enhancing the expression of Hsp72, BGP-15 is expected to protect the insulin receptor from stress-induced phosphorylation events mediated by JNK, consequently reinstating effective insulin signal transduction through the PI3K/Akt pathway. An improved PI3K/Akt signaling cascade would promote GLUT4 translocation and augment glucose uptake, thus correcting the underlying insulin resistance commonly observed in PCOS. Preclinical rodent models have shown that BGP-15 administration can result in improved insulin sensitivity not only systemically but also in tissues such as the ovary, where restoration of insulin receptor stability might contribute to improved ovarian function and reduction in hyperandrogenism. Although direct assays in isolated ovarian cells from PCOS patients remain to be performed, available data confirm that insulin receptor and GLUT4 expression are notably affected in PCOS, providing an ideal context wherein Hsp72 induction by BGP-15 could exert beneficial effects. Evidence from studies in metabolic contexts indicates that these heat shock proteins—particularly Hsp72—are expressed in ovarian tissues and their upregulation correlates with improved cellular stress responses and glucose metabolism. Thus, we anticipate that treatment with BGP-15 will lead to a reduction in JNK activation, enhanced insulin receptor signalling, and improved ovarian insulin sensitivity, which in turn might ameliorate the endocrine imbalances associated with PCOS (Niinuma et al., 2023; Pető et al., 2020; Sára, 2012).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of BGP-15 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for PCOS is highly promising based on its comprehensive preclinical and early clinical data. Among the strengths of BGP-15 is its well-characterized mechanism of action centered on Hsp72 induction, which directly addresses a key aspect of PCOS pathophysiology—insulin resistance arising from defective insulin receptor stability and subsequent impairment of downstream signaling cascades. Preclinical evidence supports that BGP-15 improves insulin sensitivity by stabilizing the receptor, reducing stress kinase (JNK) activity, and enhancing GLUT4 translocation, a mechanistic package that is particularly relevant in the context of PCOS where ovarian insulin resistance plays a central role. Additionally, early clinical studies have demonstrated that BGP-15 possesses a favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile in humans, thereby reducing the translational risk associated with repurposing. The compound’s prior investigations in other insulin-resistant conditions, along with its documented efficacy in animal models of metabolic syndrome and diabetes, add further support to its potential utility for treating PCOS (Literáti-Nagy et al., 2014; Mittermayer et al., 2015; Pető et al., 2020).

A notable advantage of BGP-15 is that its mechanism—that of enhancing cellular chaperone systems rather than acting through receptor agonism or inhibition of metabolic enzymes—does not overlap with the adverse cardiovascular and hepatic side effects that have been problematic for other insulin sensitizers, such as thiazolidinediones. By targeting fundamental cellular stress response pathways, BGP-15 may offer a more sustainable improvement in insulin sensitivity without the significant safety liabilities observed with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists. The compound’s ability to modulate JNK activity is particularly encouraging because JNK is a critical mediator of inflammation and insulin resistance, both of which contribute to the ovarian dysfunction seen in PCOS (Henstridge et al., 2014).

However, several challenges remain. While the preclinical animal data are supportive and the safety data from phase II studies in human insulin-resistant populations are encouraging, direct evidence of efficacy in PCOS-specific models or in women with PCOS is limited. Although there are indications from clinical trial databases and related metabolic studies that BGP-15 is being evaluated for metabolic disturbances relevant to PCOS, dedicated clinical studies in PCOS populations will be necessary to confirm its therapeutic benefit in terms of both metabolic and endocrine endpoints. In addition, although the mechanistic rationale is compelling, the precise molecular events in ovarian tissues—including the potential effects on steroidogenesis and follicular dynamics—need to be more thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, the extent of Hsp72 upregulation required to produce a clinically significant improvement in insulin receptor function and ovarian insulin sensitivity remains to be defined. Another potential weakness is that while the drug has been shown to enhance GLUT4 translocation in peripheral tissues, ovarian cells might have distinct signaling dynamics that could limit the translatability of systemic findings to ovarian function. Finally, while adverse effects have not emerged as intractable issues in previous studies, long-term safety and pharmacokinetics specifically in a reproductive-aged female population must be rigorously assessed (Levente, 2013; Takahashi et al., 2017).

In summary, BGP-15 presents a strong candidate for repurposing for PCOS treatment owing to its novel chaperone-based mechanism which targets the underlying insulin resistance that drives many of the endocrine disturbances in PCOS. Its capacity to induce Hsp72, thereby stabilizing the insulin receptor, reducing JNK activation, and facilitating PI3K/Akt-mediated GLUT4 translocation, offers a mechanistically sound approach to restoring metabolic and potentially reproductive function. The preclinical studies across rodent models, along with clinical phase II data demonstrating safety and favorable pharmacokinetic properties, provide a solid foundation for advancing BGP-15 into further clinical evaluation specifically targeting PCOS. Future work should focus on detailed mechanistic studies in ovarian cell models from PCOS patients, as well as carefully designed, controlled clinical trials in this population to validate efficacy endpoints beyond general insulin sensitization, including improvements in ovulatory function, androgen levels, and overall reproductive outcomes (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Niinuma et al., 2023; Pető et al., 2020).

Overall, the strengths of BGP-15 lie in its innovative mode of action, established safety in early clinical trials, and preclinical evidence of metabolic benefits, while its weaknesses include the current lack of direct clinical evidence in the specific PCOS population and uncertainty about the detailed ovarian molecular response to Hsp72 induction. However, given the significant need for improved insulin sensitizers in PCOS and the promising mechanistic rationale, BGP-15 merits further targeted investigation and clinical validation as a novel therapeutic candidate for PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Henstridge et al., 2014; Pető et al., 2020).
