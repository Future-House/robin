Proposal for SRT1720 (Cayman Chemical catalog #10009164)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SRT1720 is a synthetic small‐molecule activator of SIRT1 that was originally discovered through structure–activity relationship studies aimed at identifying compounds more potent than the natural activator resveratrol. SRT1720 belongs to the class of SIRT1 activators, a subset of small molecules known to modulate a NAD⁺‐dependent deacetylase critical for cellular metabolism, stress responses, and longevity. Synthetic in origin, SRT1720 has been chemically optimized to possess high cell permeability and increased potency, achieving an EC₁.₅ of 0.16 µM and a maximum activation value in the range of several hundred percentage points (Milne et al., 2007, pp. 1–2). This compound has been well characterized in preclinical settings for its broad metabolic benefits with favorable ADME profiles, and it exists as part of a broader therapeutic strategy aimed at rebalancing metabolic and inflammatory pathways. Historically, compounds of this chemical class have been used primarily in metabolic disorder models to mimic the benefits of caloric restriction. SRT1720 in particular has been studied in rodent models of type 2 diabetes and obesity, suggesting promising effects on insulin sensitivity and systemic inflammation (Milne et al., 2007, pp. 2–4; Lu et al., 2023, pp. 10–11).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of SRT1720 is rooted in its preclinical development as an agent for type 2 diabetes and obesity. In these studies, SRT1720 was demonstrated to improve insulin sensitivity, lower fasting blood glucose, and enhance mitochondrial function in metabolic tissues such as liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. In male db/db mice—a genetic model of type 2 diabetes—oral administration of SRT1720 reduced hyperinsulinemia and improved hepatic insulin sensitivity, while in female high‐fat diet–induced obese mice it preserved ovarian reserve by activating SIRT1 signaling and suppressing mTOR pathways (Lu et al., 2023, pp. 10–11). Despite its robust preclinical evaluation in metabolic disease models, searches within clinical trial registries have not revealed active trials specifically addressing SRT1720 or similar SIRT1 activators in the context of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, while there is considerable overlap in the underlying metabolic dysregulation between type 2 diabetes and PCOS—particularly regarding insulin resistance—the use of SRT1720 specifically for PCOS remains unexplored in human studies. However, evidence from related studies using agents that activate SIRT1 in ovarian contexts (including studies on metformin and natural SIRT1 activators such as resveratrol) offers a mechanistic rationale for repurposing SRT1720 for PCOS (Lu et al., 2023, pp. 6–7; Li et al., 2023, pp. 6–8).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of SRT1720 is well characterized at a molecular level and principally involves the allosteric activation of SIRT1—a NAD⁺-dependent deacetylase that plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolic regulation. SRT1720 binds to an allosteric site on the SIRT1 enzyme, which is exposed when SIRT1 is complexed with acetylated peptide substrates. The binding of SRT1720 to this allosteric region reduces the Michaelis constant (Kₘ) for the acetylated substrates without affecting the Kₘ for NAD⁺, thereby enhancing the catalytic efficiency of SIRT1 (Milne et al., 2007, pp. 2–5). Once activated, SIRT1 deacetylates numerous downstream targets that are central to metabolic regulation. One particularly important target in the context of PCOS is LKB1, a serine-threonine kinase that, upon deacetylation, becomes activated and in turn phosphorylates and activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK functions as a master energy sensor that regulates not only cellular energy balance but also modulates the activity of pathways critical to insulin signaling—most notably, it can inhibit serine kinases such as JNK that are known to phosphorylate IRS-1 on serine residues. This inhibition of IRS-1 serine phosphorylation is critical for sustaining the insulin receptor’s downstream signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which in turn promotes the translocation of GLUT4 and enhances glucose uptake (Lu et al., 2023, pp. 12–13; Li et al., 2023, pp. 2–4). In addition, SIRT1 activation has been associated with improved mitochondrial function as it promotes the deacetylation of PGC-1α—a transcriptional coactivator that enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism (Milne et al., 2007, pp. 1–2; Minor et al., 2011, pp. 1–2). The multifaceted action of SRT1720, therefore, spans the regulation of cellular energy homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and reduction of systemic inflammation. In ovarian theca cells derived from PCOS patients, which are known to exhibit both insulin resistance and aberrant steroidogenesis, SRT1720 is anticipated to restore metabolic balance by activating the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK axis and consequently enhancing IRS-1/PI3K/Akt signaling (Tao et al., 2019, pp. 1–2; Lu et al., 2023, p. 16).

Expected Effect:
Based on the established mechanism of action, the proposed assay hypothesizes that treatment of PCOS-derived theca cells with SRT1720 will lead to an increased deacetylation of LKB1 due to the enhanced activity of SIRT1. This deacetylated LKB1 is then expected to activate AMPK, thereby amplifying AMPK signaling. An increase in AMPK activity is known to suppress stress kinases such as JNK, which are implicated in the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Consequently, a reduction in IRS-1 serine phosphorylation will relieve the inhibition imposed on the insulin receptor signaling complex. This will promote enhanced activation of downstream effectors in the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is critical for promoting glucose uptake through the mobilization of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (Li et al., 2023, pp. 6–8; Lu et al., 2023, p. 16). Given that insulin resistance in ovarian theca cells is a well-recognized contributor to the pathogenesis of PCOS, improvement in insulin receptor signaling is expected to restore normal glucose uptake and possibly ameliorate hyperandrogenism associated with these cells. In support of this, studies have shown that SIRT1 expression in ovarian cells is linked to improved mitochondrial function, oxidative stress reduction, and normalized steroidogenesis (Li et al., 2023, pp. 12–13; Lu et al., 2023, pp. 7–8). Thus, the administration of SRT1720 would not only correct insulin resistance via the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt signaling cascade but also enhance overall metabolic health of the theca cells, with potential implications for restoring normal ovarian function in PCOS patients.

Overall Evaluation:
SRT1720 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of PCOS, particularly given its potent activation of SIRT1 and the extensive preclinical evidence supporting the role of SIRT1 in modulating key metabolic pathways. One of the major strengths of this approach is the mechanistic specificity provided by SRT1720. By directly targeting the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK axis, SRT1720 offers a novel mode of action that diverges from conventional insulin-sensitizing agents while still converging on the critical downstream PI3K/Akt pathway essential for glucose uptake. Its ability to enhance mitochondrial function further contributes to its appeal, as mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a central component in the pathophysiology of PCOS (Milne et al., 2007, pp. 1–2; Lu et al., 2023, pp. 10–11). Moreover, the favorable ADME properties and in vivo efficacy in animal models of metabolic diseases underscore SRT1720’s potential for rapid translation into ovarian cell assays and subsequent preclinical studies specific to PCOS (Minor et al., 2011, pp. 1–2).

However, there are several weaknesses and limitations to consider. First, despite the robust preclinical data in models of type 2 diabetes and obesity, there is a conspicuous absence of direct clinical or preclinical studies involving PCOS or ovarian tissues. As a result, the exact efficacy and safety profile of SRT1720 in the specific context of PCOS remain to be determined. The complexity of PCOS—which involves not only insulin resistance but also hormonal imbalances and direct ovarian dysfunction—may present challenges that are not fully captured by metabolic models alone. Additionally, while the hypothesized mechanism is compelling, the translation of these cellular effects into meaningful clinical outcomes in women with PCOS will require rigorous evaluation in both in vitro systems using PCOS-derived theca cells and in vivo animal models that recapitulate the multifactorial aspects of the disorder (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Lu et al., 2023, pp. 16–17).

Furthermore, previous studies with SRT1720 have predominantly focused on its metabolic effects, leaving some questions about potential off-target effects, long-term toxicity, and its impact on other aspects of ovarian physiology unanswered. While the activation of SIRT1 generally confers anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing benefits, a comprehensive assessment of potential hormonal side effects and interactions with other signaling pathways in ovarian tissues is necessary before advancing to clinical trials. In comparison with current standard treatments such as metformin, which has an established albeit off-label use in PCOS, SRT1720 would need to demonstrate clear benefits over existing therapies in terms of efficacy, safety, and quality of life improvements (Tao et al., 2019, pp. 1–2; Lu et al., 2023, pp. 6–7).

In summary, SRT1720 is a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of PCOS due to its potent and specific activation of SIRT1, its validated mechanism of enhancing the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK axis, and the resultant improvements in insulin signaling observed in other metabolic tissues. Its ability to deacetylate LKB1, alleviate inhibitory serine phosphorylation on IRS-1, and boost downstream PI3K/Akt-dependent glucose uptake aligns well with the underlying pathophysiology of insulin resistance in PCOS-derived ovarian theca cells. Despite the strengths, the candidate still requires further preclinical evidence in ovarian-specific models to validate both its efficacy and safety in treating PCOS. The lack of direct clinical data in PCOS represents a critical gap that our research team should address in upcoming in vitro and in vivo studies. Overall, while SRT1720 shows considerable promise as a novel therapeutic approach to correct metabolic defects in PCOS, its successful repurposing will depend on additional focused research on its actions in ovarian tissue and careful assessment of its long-term effects (Lu et al., 2023, pp. 16–17; Li et al., 2023, pp. 6–8; Milne et al., 2007, pp. 1–2).
