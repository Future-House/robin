Proposal for Celastrol (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #C0869)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Celastrol is a naturally occurring quinone methide triterpenoid isolated from the root extracts of Tripterygium wilfordii, commonly known as the Thunder God Vine, which belongs to the Celastraceae family. The compound is obtained primarily by extraction using organic solvents, with subsequent purification through chromatographic techniques, rather than via total chemical synthesis due to its structurally complex pentacyclic framework and the presence of a reactive quinone methide moiety (Allison et al., 2006; Brinker et al., 2007). Being a member of the pentacyclic triterpenoid class, celastrol has been central to traditional Chinese medicine for centuries, primarily used for its potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. In modern research, this class of natural triterpenoids has also been associated with multiple biological activities, including anticancer, neuroprotective, antioxidant, and metabolic regulatory effects, which have been documented in numerous preclinical studies (Cascão et al., 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The compound is available commercially, for instance under Sigma-Aldrich catalog number C0869, which has accelerated in-depth pharmacological research exploring its repurposing potential for diseases beyond its traditional applications, including metabolic disorders and now potentially Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).

Therapeutic History
Celastrol has garnered substantial attention due to its diverse pharmacological profile, with extensive investigations in models of metabolic dysfunction, obesity, and cancer. In rodent models of obesity and metabolic syndrome, celastrol has been shown to improve leptin sensitivity, induce weight loss, and alleviate insulin resistance through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities (Chan et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2021). Moreover, its anticancer properties have been demonstrated in various experimental models, where its ability to interfere with cellular chaperone functions, particularly targeting the Hsp90 machinery, has resulted in the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of tumor growth (Hernandes et al., 2017). Although celastrol has not been extensively investigated in clinical trials specifically addressing PCOS, there is a growing body of preclinical literature suggesting that its beneficial modulation of inflammatory and metabolic pathways may have utility in diseases that share common pathogenic mechanisms with PCOS, such as insulin resistance and chronic low-grade inflammation. Studies in experimental models of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and even certain autoimmune conditions have cumulatively provided mechanistic and functional insights that support its potential repositioning to treat endocrine disorders like PCOS (Chen et al., 2018; Hernandes et al., 2017; Kannaiyan et al., 2011). Thus, while direct clinical usage in PCOS remains to be extensively validated, the accumulated evidence from related metabolic and inflammatory models provides a compelling rationale to consider celastrol for this indication.

Mechanism of Action
Celastrol operates via a multifaceted mechanism that targets several key signaling pathways at the molecular level. One primary molecular event triggered by celastrol is the activation of Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1). HSF1 is a transcription factor that, upon activation, induces the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). These chaperone proteins mediate cellular proteostasis by facilitating proper protein folding and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins under stress conditions. The activation of HSF1 by celastrol not only provides cytoprotection but also contributes to the attenuation of cellular stress responses that are elevated in metabolic conditions (Chan et al., 2024). Concurrently, celastrol is a potent inhibitor of the nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway. NFκB is crucial for the transcription of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and plays a central role in mediating chronic inflammation. By blocking the activation of NFκB, celastrol reduces the production and secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and interleukins, thereby diminishing the inflammatory milieu that is commonly present in conditions like metabolic syndrome and PCOS (Chen et al., 2018).

Another critical aspect of celastrol’s mechanism involves its regulation of insulin signaling pathways. In states of insulin resistance, stress-activated kinases such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) are often hyperactivated, leading to serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). This aberrant phosphorylation interferes with the downstream signaling cascade normally initiated by IRS-1, thereby impairing the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream effector protein kinase B (Akt). Celastrol has been reported to inhibit JNK activity, which in turn preserves the functional integrity of IRS-1. This preservation facilitates the reactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to enhanced translocation of the glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane and improvement in glucose uptake by cells. This mechanism is fundamentally important for reversing insulin resistance, a core metabolic abnormality observed in PCOS (Xu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022).

Beyond these primary pathways, celastrol’s unique chemical structure confers additional biochemical properties. The presence of the quinone methide moiety enables celastrol to form covalent Michael adducts with reactive cysteine residues on proteins, thereby modulating the activity of a range of intracellular signaling proteins and enzymes. This mode of action further amplifies its anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects by disrupting aberrant protein–protein interactions and signaling cascades (Ng et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2019). In summary, celastrol targets multiple molecular nodes critical to the regulation of inflammation and insulin sensitivity, thereby offering a mechanistic platform that could be advantageous in treating PCOS, in which both chronic inflammation and insulin resistance play significant roles.

Expected Effect in PCOS Theca Cells
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is characterized by a constellation of endocrine, reproductive, and metabolic dysfunctions, with a pronounced role for insulin resistance and chronic inflammation in its pathogenesis. In the specific setting of ovarian theca cells, which contribute substantially to androgen production, celastrol is hypothesized to exert dual beneficial effects. First, by activating HSF1, celastrol is expected to elevate the production of heat shock proteins, reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress and enhancing cellular proteostasis (Chan et al., 2024). Theca cells in PCOS are often under considerable metabolic and inflammatory stress, conditions that exacerbate dysregulated steroidogenesis. The upregulation of HSPs could diminish such stress, thereby restoring more normalized cellular function and mitigating aberrant hormone synthesis.

Second, the inhibitory effect of celastrol on the NFκB signaling pathway carries significant implications for local inflammatory processes within the ovary. PCOS is often associated with a pro-inflammatory ovarian microenvironment due to elevated levels of cytokines like TNF-α, which not only promote insulin resistance but also influence the androgen biosynthetic machinery in theca cells. Suppression of NFκB signaling by celastrol is anticipated to reduce the production of these inflammatory mediators (Chen et al., 2018).

In parallel, inhibition of JNK activity by celastrol addresses a key molecular abnormality in insulin-resistant tissues. In PCOS, overactivation of JNK leads to inhibitory serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, thereby suppressing downstream signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway. Celastrol’s ability to inhibit JNK can restore proper IRS-1 function. With improved IRS-1 signaling, the cascade leading to Akt activation is strengthened, promoting the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane and augmenting glucose uptake by cells. Enhanced insulin signaling in ovarian theca cells could feasibly reduce hyperinsulinemia-driven androgen production, given that insulin resistance is closely linked to the endocrine imbalances observed in PCOS (Xu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022).

Collectively, in the context of PCOS, the expected cellular outcome of celastrol treatment in theca cells includes:
  • A reduction in inflammatory cytokine production due to NFκB suppression.
  • Decreased JNK activity leading to less inhibitory phosphorylation of IRS-1.
  • Enhanced activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade with increased GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake.
  • Improved cellular proteostasis via upregulation of heat shock proteins.
These coordinated effects are anticipated to translate into clinical benefits such as lowered androgen synthesis, improved insulin sensitivity, and overall normalization of the ovarian microenvironment. Such outcomes could ameliorate both the reproductive and metabolic disturbances typical of PCOS (Liu et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation
Celastrol represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for PCOS based on its robust anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties. The dual mechanism of action—activation of HSF1 and inhibition of NFκB—directly addresses critical components of PCOS pathophysiology: cellular stress and chronic inflammation. The compound’s inhibitory effect on JNK-mediated IRS-1 serine phosphorylation further supports its potential for restoring insulin signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby promoting GLUT4 translocation and improved glucose uptake (Xu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022).

One of the major strengths of celastrol as a therapeutic candidate for PCOS lies in its extensive preclinical validation in models of metabolic syndrome and obesity, conditions that share significant pathophysiological overlap with PCOS. Preclinical studies have convincingly demonstrated that celastrol can reduce leptin resistance, modulate lipid metabolism, and decrease inflammatory markers in rodent models, suggesting that similar mechanisms may be exploited in ovarian tissues. Furthermore, its documented capacity to modulate multiple intracellular pathways relevant to both inflammatory and metabolic dysfunction renders the compound uniquely suited to address the multifactorial nature of PCOS (Chan et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2021).

However, several challenges must be carefully weighed when considering celastrol for clinical application in PCOS. Celastrol is associated with a narrow therapeutic window and exhibits dose-dependent toxicity, including hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and potential reproductive toxicity, as has been observed in several preclinical studies (Wu et al., 2016; Li et al., 2022). These toxicological concerns necessitate precise dosing strategies and sufficient safety profiling, particularly in the context of a chronic condition such as PCOS where long-term administration may be required.

Moreover, celastrol’s poor water solubility and limited oral bioavailability have historically hindered its clinical development. Advances in drug delivery systems, including the development of nanoformulations such as lipid nanospheres, liposomes, and polymeric nanoparticles, have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by improving tissue targeting, enhancing systemic exposure, and reducing off-target side effects (Zhan et al., 2020; Pace et al., 2021). However, further work is needed to validate these formulations specifically in the context of reproductive disorders such as PCOS.

Another weakness is the relative paucity of direct evidence from ovarian cell models or clinical studies that explicitly test celastrol’s efficacy in PCOS patients. Most of the supporting data are derived from models of general insulin resistance, obesity, or cancer, necessitating focused studies on primary ovarian theca cells or PCOS-specific animal models to confirm whether the promising anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects translate effectively to the ovarian microenvironment (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chen et al., 2018).

Despite these challenges, the mechanistic rationale for celastrol’s application in PCOS is solid, based on its ability to modulate key signaling nodes that are aberrantly activated in this syndrome. The proposed hypotheses—that celastrol activation of HSF1 and suppression of NFκB in theca cells will reduce inflammatory cytokine production, lower JNK-mediated IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, and enhance PI3K/Akt-mediated GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake—are well rooted in the existing literature from metabolic and inflammatory disease models. In ovarian theca cells, where insulin signaling deficits contribute to hyperandrogenism and ovarian dysfunction, the reestablishment of normal signaling cascades through the dual action of celastrol could help restore endocrine balance (Liu et al., 2024; Peng et al., 2019).

Overall, celastrol possesses significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic agent for PCOS. Its strengths include a well-characterized mechanism of action with dual anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects, strong preclinical support in models of metabolic syndrome, and emerging approaches to improve its drug delivery and safety profile. Nonetheless, the limitations of narrow therapeutic margins, inherent toxicity issues, and limited direct evidence in PCOS-specific models underscore the need for dedicated preclinical investigations. Future studies should focus on validating its efficacy in ovarian tissue models, optimizing nanoformulation strategies for enhanced bioavailability, and rigorously examining its safety profile in long-term administrations relevant to PCOS management (Ng et al., 2019; Li et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2024; Peng et al., 2019).

In conclusion, with a focused research agenda that includes detailed biochemical studies in PCOS-relevant cells and carefully controlled animal models, celastrol could emerge as a compelling option for addressing the unmet clinical needs in PCOS by dual targeting of crucial inflammatory and metabolic pathways. The integration of advanced formulation technologies may further mitigate its toxicity and improve patient compliance, thereby positioning celastrol as a promising candidate in the armamentarium against PCOS.
