Proposal for Obeticholic acid (Intercept Pharmaceuticals; FXR agonist)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a semi‐synthetic bile acid derivative that was designed by modifying the structure of chenodeoxycholic acid in order to enhance its affinity and selectivity for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). As an FXR agonist, OCA belongs to a class of nuclear receptor agonists that regulate bile acid homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and glucose metabolism. Its synthesis involves chemical modifications that increase its potency by approximately 100‐fold relative to the natural FXR agonist chenodeoxycholic acid (Abenavoli et al., 2018). This compound is produced by Intercept Pharmaceuticals and is primarily used in the treatment of liver-related metabolic disorders such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). FXR agonists, as a general class, have been explored for their potential to modulate metabolic pathways that are disrupted in various metabolic diseases. This class of compounds has been extensively studied for its actions in the liver and intestines, where FXR activation leads to reduced bile acid synthesis, improved insulin sensitivity, and beneficial effects on cholesterol and lipid profiles (Abenavoli et al., 2018; Tong et al., 2025).

Therapeutic History:
Obeticholic acid has a substantial history in clinical development for metabolic liver disorders, particularly NASH and PBC. Clinical trials such as the FLINT trial have demonstrated that OCA can improve liver histology and fibrosis markers in patients with non-cirrhotic NASH, while additional studies have shown improvements in surrogate markers of insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles in diabetic patients with NAFLD (Abenavoli et al., 2018; Gan et al., 2023). In contrast to its extensive evaluation in hepatic diseases, searches of the clinical trials registry for conditions explicitly linking obeticholic acid with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) or ovarian insulin resistance—using the query “Obeticholic acid AND (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome OR PCOS OR ovarian insulin resistance)”—have returned zero clinical trials, indicating that this therapeutic candidate has not been directly examined in PCOS patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The extensive body of literature on FXR agonists remains focused on metabolic liver conditions; however, emerging preclinical and network pharmacology studies have started to explore the potential implications of bile acid signaling in extra-hepatic tissues, including the ovary. In studies using animal models and in silico analyses, bile acid-related pathways via FXR have been implicated in ovarian granulosa cell function and steroidogenesis, suggesting mechanistic hypotheses that may be translatable to PCOS pathophysiology (Takae et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
Obeticholic acid exerts its therapeutic actions predominantly through activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor that, upon activation, forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). This heterodimer binds to FXR response elements (FXRE) in the promoter regions of target genes, thereby regulating the transcription of genes involved in bile acid synthesis, lipid metabolism, and glucose homeostasis. One of the critical downstream targets of FXR activation is the small heterodimer partner (SHP), a transcriptional repressor that posts a negative feedback loop to inhibit CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis (Abenavoli et al., 2018; Tong et al., 2025). In addition to this classical pathway, FXR activation has been shown to modulate gluconeogenic and lipid regulatory genes including those involved in the synthesis and transport of lipids, such as PEPCK and sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs). FXR activation also affects inflammation by inhibiting nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling, which contributes to reduced inflammatory cytokine production. In metabolic models, FXR agonism with OCA has resulted in decreased intrahepatic lipid accumulation, improved insulin sensitivity via enhancement of the PI3K/Akt pathway, and reduced markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress likely secondary to decreased lipotoxicity (Abenavoli et al., 2018; Haczeyni et al., 2017; Tong et al., 2025).
At the molecular level, FXR activation appears to play a dual role. In hepatocytes, it controls pathways that reduce lipogenesis and stimulate fatty acid oxidation, while in adipose tissue, particularly in depot-specific fat such as periovarian adipose tissue, FXR activation has been associated with improved adipocyte morphology, reduced inflammatory infiltrates, and increased expression of thermogenic markers (Haczeyni et al., 2017; Tong et al., 2025).
Importantly, the expression of FXR in ovarian granulosa cells has been detected, although its functional role in these cells is less extensively characterized compared to liver and intestinal tissues. Studies have demonstrated that FXR in ovarian granulosa cells modulates genes related to steroidogenesis, such as aromatase (CYP19A1) and may interact with lipid binding proteins like FABP6. The intrinsic role of FXR signaling in granulosa cells suggests that FXR agonists like OCA might influence ovarian function by modulating intra-cellular lipid accumulation, inflammatory cytokine production, and insulin signaling pathways (Takae et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021). Additionally, network pharmacology analyses have predicted that modulation of FXR can influence key metabolic signaling cascades including PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and cAMP signaling routes that are central to both insulin sensitivity and cell survival, establishing a solid rationale for the therapeutic hypothesis (Tong et al., 2025).

Expected Effect:
The working hypothesis for employing obeticholic acid in PCOS is that activation of FXR in ovarian granulosa cells will favorably modulate the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. Specifically, the anticipated effects include upregulation of the small heterodimer partner (SHP) that serves as a key regulator of bile acid synthesis and lipid metabolism genes, as well as modulation of gluconeogenic genes such as PEPCK. By reducing intracellular lipid accumulation, OCA is expected to decrease lipotoxicity-driven endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress—a condition known to impair insulin receptor signaling. Consequently, the reduction in ER stress may lead to enhanced insulin receptor activity and improved PI3K/Akt signaling. This cascade of molecular events is hypothesized to increase glucose uptake in granulosa cells and may contribute to restoring normal cellular function and steroidogenesis, which are commonly compromised in PCOS (Abenavoli et al., 2018; Tong et al., 2025).
In support of this expected effect, recent studies have detected FXR expression in ovarian granulosa cells and suggested that its activation might regulate steroidogenic pathways via modulation of lipid metabolism and inflammatory signals (Takae et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021). Moreover, the biochemical processes linked to insulin signaling—chiefly the PI3K/Akt pathway—are critical for normal granulosa cell function and glucose uptake. Given that PCOS is characterized by an impaired insulin signaling cascade along with excessive lipid accumulation in the ovary, therapeutic modulation through FXR activation could yield multifaceted benefits by reducing both lipotoxicity and inflammatory stress while improving insulin sensitivity (Belani et al., 2018; Kong et al., 2017).
Furthermore, preclinical data from hepatic and adipose tissues demonstrate that OCA improves systemic insulin sensitivity, reduces hepatic steatosis, and modulates adipose tissue architecture, all of which are metabolic factors that could indirectly influence ovarian function. For example, the improvement in periovarian adipose tissue morphology, as seen in wild-type mice treated with OCA in dietary obesity models, may have parallel benefits for ovarian insulin sensitivity and steroidogenic function in PCOS patients (Haczeyni et al., 2017; Tong et al., 2025).
Consequently, in the assay proposed, one would expect that obeticholic acid treatment would lead to (1) a reduction in lipotoxicity markers and ER stress indicators in cultured granulosa cells, (2) modulation of key metabolic gene expression patterns such as increased SHP and reduced PEPCK transcription, and (3) an improvement in insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt signaling, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of Akt and enhanced GLUT4 translocation, ultimately leading to improved glucose uptake (Takae et al., 2019; Tong et al., 2025).

Overall Evaluation:
Obeticholic acid represents a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, particularly given the strong mechanistic rationale derived from its known effects on FXR activation. The compound benefits from an extensive safety and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile established in clinical trials for liver diseases such as NASH and PBC (Abenavoli et al., 2018; Gan et al., 2023). Its well-characterized mechanism of action—namely, the activation of FXR leading to modulation of bile acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism pathways—suggests a possible extension of these benefits to ovarian tissue. In PCOS, where insulin resistance, lipotoxicity, and inflammation contribute to ovarian dysfunction, the ability of OCA to reduce intracellular lipid accumulation and inflammatory signaling while enhancing insulin sensitivity through the PI3K/Akt pathway is highly appealing (Belani et al., 2018; Tong et al., 2025).

One clear strength of this candidate is its established clinical safety record and the comprehensive mechanistic understanding that underpins its effects in metabolic liver diseases. This provides confidence that OCA could be rapidly advanced into phase II clinical investigations for PCOS if initial preclinical models in ovarian granulosa cells show promising results. The cross-talk between hepatic metabolic regulation and ovarian function has become an emerging area of research, and targeting FXR in granulosa cells represents a novel angle that could address the metabolic component of PCOS beyond current treatments that predominantly focus on hormonal modulation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rađenović et al., 2022).

However, several potential weaknesses and challenges must be acknowledged. First, despite the robust preclinical data in liver and adipose tissues, direct evidence for OCA’s efficacy in ovarian tissue, particularly in the modulation of granulosa cell function and insulin signaling, remains limited. The current literature contains no dedicated clinical trials or biochemical studies specifically evaluating OCA in PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, the ovarian microenvironment differs substantially from hepatic tissues, and the expression levels and downstream targets of FXR in granulosa cells are not fully delineated. There is a need for more targeted in vitro and in vivo studies to establish the dose-response relationships, tissue-specific gene regulation, and long-term effects of FXR activation in the ovary (Takae et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021).

Another consideration is that the metabolic benefits observed with OCA in liver disease models may not extrapolate completely to PCOS, given the complex etiology of PCOS which involves hyperandrogenism, reproductive dysfunction, and systemic insulin resistance. The specific impact of FXR activation on granulosa cell steroidogenesis and follicular development requires further clarification, as alterations in these pathways could potentially have unintended effects on reproductive hormone balance (Tong et al., 2025; Belani et al., 2018). Additionally, the dose required to achieve effective concentrations in the ovary without eliciting adverse effects remains unknown, and the possibility exists that systemic FXR activation may produce off-target metabolic effects that could complicate the clinical picture in PCOS patients.

Moreover, while the hypothesis that FXR activation will reduce ER stress and lipotoxicity in granulosa cells is supported by findings in hepatic cells, the cellular context of the ovary presents unique challenges. Granulosa cells in the ovarian follicle are highly differentiated and perform complex endocrine functions, and modulation of any nuclear receptor in these cells must be carefully balanced to avoid disrupting normal steroidogenesis. The risk of inadvertently exacerbating hormonal imbalances in PCOS is a consideration that will require careful experimental and clinical investigation (Takae et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021).

Overall, obeticholic acid is a compelling candidate for repurposing in PCOS based on its well-established mechanism of action and the theoretical benefits of FXR activation in modulating lipid and glucose metabolism. Its potential to reduce lipotoxicity-driven ER stress and enhance insulin receptor signaling in ovarian granulosa cells aligns closely with the unmet needs in PCOS therapy. However, the critical gaps in direct ovarian-specific data necessitate further preclinical studies that characterize FXR expression and function in granulosa cells, define the gene expression changes induced by OCA in ovarian tissue, and establish proof of concept in relevant animal models of PCOS. The strengths of OCA lie in its known safety profile and the detailed mechanistic framework that supports its metabolic benefits, while its weaknesses include the current absence of direct clinical or biochemical evidence in the PCOS setting and uncertainty regarding ovarian tissue specificity. In conclusion, although promising, obeticholic acid will require a robust investigative program to validate its efficacy and safety in PCOS before it can be considered a viable therapeutic option for repurposing. Continued collaboration between reproductive biologists, endocrinologists, and metabolic researchers is essential to address these gaps and fully assess whether FXR activation by obeticholic acid can restore normal metabolic and reproductive function in PCOS patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Abenavoli et al., 2018; Tong et al., 2025; Takae et al., 2019).
