Proposal for AdipoRon (Enzo Life Sciences catalog #BML-SA298)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
AdipoRon is a small‐molecule synthetic agonist of the adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 that was discovered through high‐throughput screening of compound libraries at the University of Tokyo. Its identification followed a rational, structure‐based drug discovery approach that leveraged the novel structural insights into adiponectin receptor architecture, specifically their unique seven‐transmembrane domain configuration with a zinc‐binding site distinct from that found in classic G protein‐coupled receptors (Okada‐Iwabu et al., 2015). As the first orally active adiponectin receptor activator, AdipoRon belongs to a class of compounds intended to mimic the properties of adiponectin, a hormone secreted by adipose tissue that is profoundly involved in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, and mitochondrial function. Its synthetic nature makes it significantly more druggable compared to the naturally occurring adiponectin protein, thus circumventing the challenges associated with administering large peptide hormones that possess poor stability and unfavorable pharmacokinetic profiles (Iwabu et al., 2015; Lee, 2020). This class of small‐molecule adiponectin receptor agonists has been broadly explored, initially for their anti‐diabetic, anti‐obesity, and cardiometabolic benefits, and their inherent oral bioavailability positions them as promising candidates for repurposing in several metabolic and inflammatory conditions.

Therapeutic History:
Historically, the development of AdipoRon has been driven by the unmet need to mimic the beneficial metabolic effects of adiponectin—namely, improved insulin sensitivity, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, and anti‐inflammatory actions—in a manner that is both practical and clinically relevant. Preclinical research, dating from its first description, has demonstrated that administration of AdipoRon in obese and diabetic rodent models leads to a marked improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, normalization of lipid profiles, and even lifespan extension in high‐fat diet‐induced obesity models (Okada‐Iwabu et al., 2015; Otvos, 2019). Moreover, its efficacy is not limited to metabolic endpoints; studies have also reported promising results in cardiovascular protection, as evidenced by its ability to attenuate postischemic myocardial apoptosis via AMPK‐mediated as well as AMPK‐independent pathways (Zhang et al., 2015). In oncology, emerging reports have evaluated AdipoRon’s antiproliferative and pro‐apoptotic effects across various cancer cell lines—including pancreatic, breast, ovarian, and osteosarcoma—with the aim of exploiting adiponectin receptor activation to counteract tumorigenesis (Nigro et al., 2021). Despite a rich history of investigation in metabolic and cancer models, to date there are no direct published studies detailing the use of AdipoRon in the context of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) specifically. Nonetheless, the pathophysiological basis of PCOS—characterized by insulin resistance, chronic low‐grade inflammation, and impaired metabolic signaling—shares several mechanistic commonalities with the conditions where AdipoRon has shown efficacy. In particular, reduced circulating adiponectin levels and impaired adiponectin receptor signaling have been implicated in the insulin resistance observed in PCOS patients (Iwabu et al., 2021; Kim & Park, 2019). Thus, while AdipoRon itself has not been directly tested in PCOS granulosa cells or in clinical PCOS populations, its well‐documented role in ameliorating insulin resistance and mitigating inflammation in other tissues supports a strong theoretical rationale for its repurposing in PCOS.

Mechanism of Action:
AdipoRon functions by binding directly to the adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, thereby acting as a receptor agonist that recapitulates the effects of its endogenous ligand, adiponectin. Upon binding, AdipoRon activates a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways that are central to metabolic regulation. Its actions include the phosphorylation and activation of AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the subsequent downstream activation of key metabolic regulators such as peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and the coactivator PGC‐1α. Activation of these pathways results in enhanced fatty acid oxidation, improved mitochondrial biogenesis, and overall better energy metabolism (Kim & Park, 2019; Okada‐Iwabu et al., 2019). Additionally, AdipoRon has been shown to increase intrinsic ceramidase activity within the cell, thereby promoting the conversion of pro‐apoptotic ceramides to sphingosine‐1 phosphate (S1P), which confers cytoprotective effects and further contributes to improved insulin sensitivity (Otvos, 2019).

At the molecular level, the binding of AdipoRon to the receptors induces a conformational change that favors the recruitment and activation of intracellular kinases. In skeletal muscle and hepatic cells, this leads to significant AMPK phosphorylation, which in turn facilitates the activation of downstream substrates responsible for promoting glucose uptake and enhancing insulin signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway (Iwabu et al., 2021; Kim & Park, 2019). The details of this receptor‐mediated activation underscore the compound’s ability to switch cellular metabolism from a lipogenic state to one favoring lipid oxidation and energy expenditure. Moreover, AdipoRon exhibits anti‐inflammatory properties by attenuating signaling pathways such as JNK and IKK, which are linked to the inflammatory cascade frequently upregulated in insulin‐resistant states (Nigro et al., 2021). This dual capacity to both enhance anabolic insulin signaling and suppress catabolic inflammatory responses is particularly relevant given the metabolic and inflammatory derangements observed in PCOS.

Furthermore, structural studies have reinforced that the molecular framework of AdipoRon, which includes a benzyl substituted piperidine moiety essential for receptor binding, is critical for its specificity towards adiponectin receptors. Although detailed synthetic procedures are complex and primarily described in medicinal chemistry literature, the key point is that the design of AdipoRon was guided by structure‐activity relationship (SAR) analyses aiming to optimize its binding affinity (Kd values of approximately 1.8 and 3.1 µM for AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, respectively) and its subsequent biological potency (Dib et al., 2017; Okada‐Iwabu et al., 2018). These mechanistic insights collectively suggest that AdipoRon’s effects result from a concerted activation of metabolic and anti‐inflammatory pathways, making it a multifunctional agent in the modulation of insulin sensitivity and cellular energy status.

Expected Effect in PCOS Granulosa Cells:
The hypothesis driving the repurposing of AdipoRon for PCOS is predicated on the well‐established observation that women with PCOS often exhibit reduced serum adiponectin levels and decreased adiponectin receptor activity, contributing to insulin resistance—a hallmark of the syndrome. In granulosa cells, which play a central role in folliculogenesis and ovarian steroidogenesis, insulin resistance is a key factor that disrupts normal ovarian function and contributes to the clinical manifestations of PCOS, including anovulation and hyperandrogenism (Iwabu et al., 2021; Kim & Park, 2019).

Administration of AdipoRon is expected to directly activate AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 on ovarian granulosa cells. This activation should trigger the phosphorylation of AMPK, leading to improved mitochondrial function and increased fatty acid oxidation, thereby ameliorating the lipotoxic environment often observed in PCOS ovaries (Okada‐Iwabu et al., 2019; Otvos, 2019). Moreover, by simultaneously engaging PPARα, AdipoRon would be anticipated to promote transcriptional programs that favor enhanced glucose uptake and lipid metabolism. The downstream activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, a critical mediator for insulin signaling, is expected to further drive glucose uptake into the granulosa cells, thus helping to restore normal cellular insulin responsiveness (Iwabu et al., 2021; Kim & Park, 2019).

From a mechanistic standpoint, the anti‐inflammatory properties of AdipoRon are of particular importance in the PCOS context. By suppressing the JNK and IKK signaling pathways, which are commonly upregulated in insulin‐resistant states and contribute to chronic low‐grade inflammation, AdipoRon is anticipated to reduce inflammatory cytokine production in granulosa cells. The reduction in inflammation is likely to alleviate the autocrine and paracrine disruption of insulin signaling in the ovary, thus supporting improved follicular development and reducing androgen excess. The net effect of these actions would be enhanced insulin sensitivity and improved metabolic activity within granulosa cells, which in turn could normalize ovarian function in PCOS patients (Kim & Park, 2019; Iwabu et al., 2015).

It is also relevant to note that the expected effects of AdipoRon are supported by extensive preclinical studies wherein its administration in animal models results in improved glucose homeostasis, enhanced insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and liver, and reduction of inflammatory markers (Lee, 2020; Nigro et al., 2021). While direct studies in ovarian granulosa cells are lacking, the conserved nature of adiponectin receptor signaling across multiple tissues lends credibility to the hypothesis that a similar mechanism is present in the ovary. Furthermore, the literature documents that AMPK activation is a crucial mediator in cells exhibiting insulin resistance, making the expected stimulation of the PI3K/Akt axis via AMPK activation by AdipoRon a plausible therapeutic strategy for PCOS (Kim & Park, 2019; Okada‐Iwabu et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, AdipoRon presents as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome based on several compelling factors. At a mechanistic level, its ability to activate adiponectin receptors and stimulate downstream signaling pathways—namely AMPK and PPARα—which are intimately involved in regulating insulin sensitivity and cellular metabolism, is directly relevant to the pathophysiology of PCOS. The compound’s dual anti‐diabetic and anti‐inflammatory actions address two of the core abnormalities observed in PCOS: insulin resistance and chronic low‐grade inflammation (Iwabu et al., 2015; Kim & Park, 2019).

Strengths of AdipoRon include its oral bioavailability and established safety profile in rodent models, which facilitate rapid preclinical development and potential clinical translation. Its synthetic nature confers several advantages over biologics; notably, it can be manufactured consistently at scale, and its molecular structure can be optimized through medicinal chemistry approaches to enhance potency, tissue specificity, or pharmacokinetic properties as needed (Lee, 2020; Otvos, 2019). Moreover, the well‐documented beneficial effects of AdipoRon in improving glucose uptake and reducing lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle, liver, and cardiac tissue provide a strong rationale for similar metabolic benefits in ovarian granulosa cells. Given that insulin resistance is a central driver of the endocrine and metabolic disturbances in PCOS, the restoration of proper insulin signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway may potentially correct dysfunctional steroidogenesis and follicular development.

On the other hand, there are notable challenges and weaknesses that must be considered. Despite a robust body of evidence supporting AdipoRon’s metabolic benefits in peripheral tissues, direct evidence for its efficacy in ovarian granulosa cells remains sparse. As PCOS is a heterogeneous disorder and ovarian tissue features unique regulatory mechanisms, it is critical to conduct dedicated in vitro studies in human granulosa cells to confirm that AdipoRon elicits the desired activation of AMPK and PPARα pathways while effectively suppressing JNK/IKK‐mediated inflammation and enhancing PI3K/Akt signaling (Nigro et al., 2021; Iwabu et al., 2021). Another consideration is the potential for variable dose‐dependent responses. As noted in other cell types, AdipoRon can exhibit a range of effects—from beneficial metabolic stimulation at lower doses to potential cellular toxicity or even pro‐apoptotic signaling at higher concentrations (Lee, 2020; Fairaq, 2017). Therefore, careful dose–response studies must be undertaken in ovarian models to determine the therapeutic window, ensuring that the beneficial insulin‐sensitizing and anti‐inflammatory effects can be harnessed without eliciting adverse effects.

Furthermore, while insulin resistance in PCOS has been frequently linked to reduced adiponectin levels and signaling, the exact expression and activity levels of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in PCOS granulosa cells need to be clearly characterized. Differential expression of these receptors may alter the overall response to agonist treatment, and it is possible that other signaling modulators present in the ovarian microenvironment could influence the efficacy of AdipoRon (Kim & Park, 2019; Okada‐Iwabu et al., 2019). It will thus be essential to corroborate the presence and functionality of these receptors in both in vitro and in vivo PCOS models.

In terms of clinical translation, the relatively extensive preclinical data from metabolic and cardiovascular studies in rodent models are encouraging. However, as with any repurposing strategy, there is a gap that must be bridged by demonstrating that the pathways modulated by AdipoRon in other tissues faithfully recapitulate in ovarian physiology in PCOS (Iwabu et al., 2021; Kim & Park, 2019). Because PCOS is a multifactorial disease with endocrine, metabolic, and reproductive components, a multifaceted study design incorporating both cellular assays in granulosa cells and animal models that display features of PCOS will be necessary to validate the therapeutic potential of AdipoRon.

Overall, taking into account its established mechanism of action, successful preclinical profile in related metabolic disorders, and the biological rationale linking impaired adiponectin signaling to insulin resistance in PCOS, AdipoRon emerges as a promising candidate for therapeutic repurposing. Its strengths lie in its ability to simultaneously target multiple dysregulated pathways—enhancing AMPK–mediated insulin sensitivity, activating PPARα for improved lipid metabolism, and suppressing inflammatory signaling cascades—that are central to the pathology of PCOS. Nevertheless, targeted studies must confirm its efficacy and safety in ovarian tissue, and careful calibration of dosages will be required to prevent potential adverse effects. Given these considerations, advancing AdipoRon into proof‐of‐concept experiments in PCOS‐relevant cellular systems and animal models is justified and could potentially open a new avenue for treating the metabolic and reproductive disturbances that characterize PCOS (Okada‐Iwabu et al., 2015; Nigro et al., 2021).

In conclusion, while further targeted research is needed to establish direct effects in PCOS ovarian cells, the comprehensive literature supports the potential for AdipoRon to restore impaired adiponectin receptor signaling and improve insulin sensitivity, suggesting it could be an innovative therapeutic candidate for PCOS treatment.
