Proposal for Salubrinal (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #SML0343)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Salubrinal is a synthetic small molecule originally identified through chemical screening efforts designed to modulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. It was discovered as an inhibitor of the protein phosphatase complexes responsible for dephosphorylating the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), thereby enabling sustained phosphorylation of eIF2α and maintaining the adaptive arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR). As a member of the small molecule ER stress modulators, Salubrinal belongs to a pharmacological class that generally aims to reduce the burden of misfolded proteins in the ER by attenuating global protein translation. This class of compounds has been extensively used in preclinical studies to provide cellular protection in conditions characterized by excessive ER stress, such as neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and certain models of ovarian dysfunction. The compound is commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #SML0343) and has been characterized both biochemically and using molecular docking models that demonstrate its interaction with key residues in the PP1/GADD34 complex (Harada et al., 2021; Zadorozhnii et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Salubrinal has been applied predominantly in preclinical settings. In cellular models, it has shown promise as a protective agent against ER stress–induced apoptosis in neuronal cells and models of neurodegenerative diseases, where sustained eIF2α phosphorylation delays cell death. Preclinical studies in rodent models have further demonstrated that Salubrinal can reverse obesity-associated ovarian dysfunction, improving oocyte developmental competence and restoring mitochondrial function (Harada et al., 2021). Outside of reproductive biology, its ability to modulate ER stress has been explored in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other conditions featuring misfolded protein accumulation (Vieira et al., 2024). However, despite the mechanistic promise and extensive research on ER stress in metabolic and endocrine diseases, Salubrinal itself has not yet been directly evaluated in clinical trials for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Searches of clinical trial databases for “Salubrinal OR eIF2α OR ER stress AND Polycystic Ovary Syndrome” reveal studies examining ER stress markers in PCOS and the use of insulin sensitizers (e.g., metformin and myo-inositol) but do not indicate any direct investigation of Salubrinal in this setting (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hernández Mijares, 2013; Rocha Barajas, 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Salubrinal exerts its effects by selectively inhibiting eIF2α phosphatases, primarily those associated with the regulatory subunit GADD34 in complex with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). By preventing dephosphorylation of eIF2α, Salubrinal sustains the phosphorylated state of this key translation initiation factor. Under conditions of ER stress, phosphorylation of eIF2α acts as a braking mechanism on global protein synthesis, thereby reducing the influx of nascent proteins into the ER and giving the cell time to restore proteostasis. This prolonged adaptive response facilitates the selective translation of stress-responsive genes such as ATF4, which orchestrates downstream cytoprotective pathways. Moreover, by maintaining eIF2α phosphorylation, Salubrinal indirectly contributes to a reduction in the activation of stress kinases such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which have been implicated in mediating insulin resistance through inhibitory serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates in various cell types (Harada et al., 2021; Vieira et al., 2024). Additionally, preclinical studies have demonstrated that reducing ER stress via sustained eIF2α phosphorylation can positively influence insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. For instance, experiments in a GALT-deficient mouse model showcased that Salubrinal treatment restored diminished PI3K/Akt signaling, a pathway critically linked to insulin sensitivity (Balakrishnan et al., 2017). These molecular interactions are supported by computational studies showing stable binding of Salubrinal to active sites within eIF2α phosphatase complexes (Zadorozhnii et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
In the context of PCOS, granulosa cells often exhibit ER stress and dysregulated UPR, which are thought to contribute to insulin resistance and impaired ovarian function. The central hypothesis under evaluation is that Salubrinal, by inhibiting eIF2α phosphatase activity, will help sustain adaptive UPR signaling in these cells. By sustaining eIF2α phosphorylation, Salubrinal is expected to lower the accumulation of misfolded proteins, thereby reducing the activation of pro-apoptotic stress signals, including JNK. Reduction in JNK activation is significant because JNK has been implicated in the pathological suppression of insulin receptor signaling through serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates, leading to insulin resistance. Consequently, improved insulin receptor signaling should enhance PI3K/Akt pathway activation, which is vital for glucose uptake and metabolic regulation in granulosa cells (Harada et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2020). Since insulin signaling plays an important role in follicular development and ovulation, restoring this pathway is anticipated to ameliorate some of the reproductive and metabolic dysfunctions associated with PCOS (Harada et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2020). Moreover, granulosa cell studies have repeatedly shown that the expression of key UPR components and stress kinases is altered in PCOS, suggesting that molecules modulating these pathways could have a direct physiological impact (Jin et al., 2020; Takahashi et al., 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
Salubrinal presents a compelling mechanistic rationale as a drug candidate for repurposing in the treatment of PCOS based on its capacity to modulate ER stress—a pathway increasingly understood to contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. One of the major strengths of Salubrinal lies in its targeted mechanism of action: by selectively inhibiting eIF2α phosphatase activity, it prolongs eIF2α phosphorylation and supports an adaptive rather than apoptotic UPR. This approach not only reduces the burden of misfolded proteins but also limits the activation of stress kinases, such as JNK, that are known to impair insulin receptor signaling. Given that insulin resistance is a central feature of PCOS, particularly within ovarian granulosa cells, enhancing the PI3K/Akt pathway via reduction of ER stress could improve glucose uptake and overall metabolic outcomes (Harada et al., 2021; Balakrishnan et al., 2017).

However, several weaknesses and outstanding challenges remain. Although preclinical studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of Salubrinal in models of obesity-associated ovarian dysfunction and other ER stress–related conditions, there is as yet no direct clinical or preclinical evidence specifically in PCOS models. Clinical trials in PCOS have focused on insulin sensitizers like metformin rather than on direct ER stress modulators, and the literature does not record any studies in which Salubrinal has been administered to women with PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hernández Mijares, 2013; Rocha Barajas, 2020). Additionally, while sustained phosphorylation of eIF2α is generally protective under moderate stress, chronic inhibition of dephosphorylation might have deleterious effects on cellular homeostasis if the balance shifts too far from the normal transient responses of the UPR. Off-target effects, potential toxicity, and pharmacokinetic challenges such as solubility and bioavailability also remain significant hurdles in translating Salubrinal from bench to bedside. The evidence from other disease models, including the reversal of aberrant PI3K/Akt signaling in a GALT-deficient mouse, is promising but not directly translatable to the complex molecular environment of PCOS (Balakrishnan et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2020). Finally, while the compound demonstrates favorable in vitro potency and specificity in its known mechanism, the lack of clinical studies specifically addressing its use for PCOS means that the true therapeutic benefit and safety profile in the intended population remain to be established.

In conclusion, Salubrinal’s mechanism of sustaining adaptive UPR through inhibition of eIF2α dephosphorylation, coupled with its potential to reduce stress-induced JNK activation and improve insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt signaling, places it among promising candidates for repurposing in PCOS. Its demonstrated efficacy in reducing ER stress in various cellular and animal models supports the hypothesis that it could ameliorate the insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction observed in PCOS granulosa cells. However, the absence of direct evidence in PCOS models and the potential for off-target effects underscore the need for further preclinical studies before advancing to clinical trials. Overall, while Salubrinal shows attractive mechanistic promise as a drug candidate for PCOS, rigorous validation in relevant ovarian cell models and animal studies is necessary to ensure its efficacy and safety in this new therapeutic context (Harada et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2020; Balakrishnan et al., 2017).
