Proposal for Roflumilast (Novartis; PDE4 inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Roflumilast is a small‐molecule, synthetic drug belonging to the phosphodiesterase‐4 (PDE4) inhibitor class. Originally developed for the treatment of chronic inflammatory airway diseases, its discovery and development focused on its potent and selective inhibition of PDE4 enzymes, thereby elevating intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Roflumilast was synthesized and optimized from early PDE4 inhibitors such as rolipram, with modifications that improved its pharmacokinetic profile and tolerated dosing schedules for once‐daily oral administration. As a member of the PDE4 inhibitor class, it has been used primarily in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – a condition marked by persistent inflammation and airflow limitation – by modulating the immune responses of inflammatory cells. Its chemical derivation and further optimization have resulted in a compound with robust safety data and predictable pharmacodynamics, which forms the basis for hypothesizing its potential repurposing in metabolic diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (Jensterle, Kocjan, & Janez, 2014; Hatzelmann et al., 2010).

Therapeutic History:
Clinically, roflumilast has an established history in treating inflammatory pulmonary diseases. It was approved for the management of severe COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations due to its anti-inflammatory properties along with modest bronchodilator effects. Its efficacy has been demonstrated by its ability to reduce proinflammatory cytokine levels, decrease the number of exacerbations, and improve overall lung function in this population (Jensterle et al., 2015; Mollmann et al., 2017). Although its primary indication to date has been for respiratory disease, experimental studies and pilot clinical trials in related metabolic conditions have produced evidence for improved insulin sensitivity and weight loss in obese and diabetic models (Mollmann et al., 2017; Muo et al., 2019). Importantly, preclinical investigations in rodent models of PCOS have suggested that combinatorial therapies using roflumilast with metformin can lead to greater weight loss and metabolic improvements compared with metformin monotherapy, though the data remains preliminary (Tohma et al., 2019). However, while roflumilast has been studied in obese and insulin‐resistant populations, to date there is no extensive clinical history of its sole use as a treatment for PCOS, and its direct effects on ovarian granulosa cells remain to be fully characterized (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2013).

Mechanism of Action:
Roflumilast exerts its pharmacological effects via robust and selective inhibition of the PDE4 family of enzymes, which are responsible for degrading cAMP. Under normal physiological conditions, cAMP functions as a key secondary messenger involved in modulating inflammation, immune cell activation, cellular metabolism, and gene transcription through the downstream activation of protein kinase A (PKA). By inhibiting PDE4, roflumilast leads to an accumulation of cAMP, resulting in activation of PKA and other cAMP-responsive pathways. This elevation of cAMP is known to induce de novo expression of anti-inflammatory mediators while simultaneously attenuating the activity of inflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) and stress-activated protein kinases like c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (Jensterle et al., 2014; Giembycz & Newton, 2014). In the context of PCOS, chronic low-grade inflammation is implicated in disrupting insulin receptor signaling. Inflammatory mediators, through NFκB and JNK, impair insulin receptor substrate functions and impede the downstream phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which is crucial for facilitating GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in metabolic tissues. Roflumilast’s ability to suppress these inflammatory cascades, by reducing NFκB and JNK activity via increased cAMP/PKA signaling, may thereby ameliorate insulin resistance (Sever et al., 2018; Xu, Zhang, & Xiao, 2021). Moreover, the mechanistic specificity of PDE4 inhibition in elevating cAMP has been documented in various tissues including immune cells and, potentially, ovarian granulosa cells; although direct mechanistic studies in these ovarian cells are less extensive, the general expression of PDE enzymes in ovarian tissue provides a biochemical rationale (Jensterle et al., 2014; Crocetti et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
Within the context of PCOS, the hypothesis is that chronic inflammation contributes to the impairment of insulin signaling in ovarian granulosa cells. In these cells, elevated inflammatory signaling via NFκB and JNK pathways can disrupt insulin receptor substrate functions, thereby reducing the efficacy of insulin-stimulated PI3K/Akt signaling. The ensuing defect in insulin signaling results in diminished translocation of GLUT4 transporters to the plasma membrane, leading to reduced glucose uptake and contributing to systemic insulin resistance—a hallmark of PCOS (Garruti et al., 2009; Tohma et al., 2019). By administering roflumilast, it is expected that PDE4 inhibition will elevate intracellular cAMP within granulosa cells, which in turn will activate PKA. PKA activation is anticipated to lead to a reduction in NFκB and JNK-mediated inflammatory signaling, alleviating their inhibitory effects on insulin receptor signaling. With these inflammatory brakes removed, the insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt pathway could be more responsive, resulting in increased GLUT4 translocation and an enhanced uptake of glucose by the cells (Jensterle et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2020). Evidence from rodent models, where the combination of roflumilast with metformin produced significant improvements in glucose homeostasis and weight loss, supports the notion that roflumilast-induced PDE4 inhibition may potentiate metabolic signaling in insulin-resistant states (Tohma et al., 2019; Mollmann et al., 2017). Furthermore, given that granulosa cells have been shown to express components of the cAMP signaling machinery and that cyclic nucleotide modulation plays a role in steroidogenesis and follicular function, the proposed effect in enhancing insulin signaling is mechanistically plausible (Jensterle et al., 2014; Crocetti et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Roflumilast presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in PCOS based on several lines of evidence. One significant strength of roflumilast is its well-established safety profile and robust pharmacokinetic data obtained from years of clinical use in COPD. Its mechanism—selective inhibition of PDE4 leading to elevated intracellular cAMP and subsequent modulation of inflammatory signaling cascades—is well characterized and has demonstrated efficacy in reducing proinflammatory cytokine production and improving insulin sensitivity in preclinical experiments (Jensterle et al., 2014; Mollmann et al., 2017). The specific hypothesis that roflumilast can elevate cAMP in PCOS granulosa cells and thereby activate PKA to reduce NFκB and JNK signaling, while simultaneously potentiating insulin receptor-mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway to enhance GLUT4 translocation, is mechanistically sound and supported by fundamental cellular biochemistry (Sever et al., 2018; Tohma et al., 2019). Additionally, while preclinical rodent studies and pilot clinical trials in obese or diabetic cohorts hint at metabolic benefits of PDE4 inhibition, direct evidence of efficacy in PCOS patients or in ovarian granulosa cells specifically is limited. Most published data focus on respiratory and systemic metabolic effects rather than reproductive endocrine endpoints, and thus it remains an open question whether the biochemical improvements observed systemically translate into restored ovarian insulin signaling and improved follicular function in PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2013, 2014). Additionally, while the anti-inflammatory effects via cAMP elevation are well demonstrated in immune cells and pulmonary tissues, the degree to which these mechanisms operate in ovarian granulosa cells needs further experimental validation (Jensterle et al., 2014; Lugnier, 2022). There is also the challenge of dosing and pharmacokinetic considerations when repurposing for a new indication; the effective concentration in ovarian tissue might differ from that achieved in the lung, and potential off-target effects in reproductive tissues have yet to be thoroughly explored (Tohma et al., 2019; Akel et al., 2024).

In summary, roflumilast’s potent anti-inflammatory action, mediated through PDE4 inhibition and subsequent cAMP elevation, coupled with preclinical data demonstrating improved insulin sensitivity, provides a solid rationale for its evaluation as a repurposed therapeutic candidate in PCOS. Its clinical safety and well‐characterized mechanism make it attractive for further investigation. However, before advancing to large-scale clinical trials in PCOS, additional targeted preclinical studies are needed to specifically evaluate its effects on ovarian granulosa cells, insulin receptor signaling, and follicular function in relevant animal models. Overall, roflumilast shows significant potential, but further research is required to confirm its therapeutic efficacy and to determine the optimal dosing regimen for combating the metabolic and inflammatory disturbances prevalent in PCOS (Jensterle et al., 2015; Mollmann et al., 2017; Xu, Zhang, & Xiao, 2021; Schudt, Hatzelmann, Beume, & Tenor, 2011).
