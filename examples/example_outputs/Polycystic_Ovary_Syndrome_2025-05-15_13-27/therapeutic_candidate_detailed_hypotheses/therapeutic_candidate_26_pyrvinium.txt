Proposal for Pyrvinium pamoate (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #P0022)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pyrvinium pamoate is a synthetic quinoline‐derived cyanine dye originally developed as an anthelmintic drug. Its synthesis traces back to early work in the 1940s and early 1950s, when compounds with cyanine dye characteristics were identified as active agents against parasitic worms. The compound is most commonly used in its pamoate salt form, which enhances its stability and permits oral dosing despite its inherent poor aqueous solubility. As a molecule, pyrvinium pamoate belongs to the class of antihelminthic agents that were historically used to treat enterobiasis (pinworm infection) and other helminth infections in both human and veterinary medicine (Downey et al., 2008; Desai, 1962). Over decades, while its primary indication has remained anti-parasitic therapy, its unique molecular structure and bioactivity profile have attracted interest as a repurposing candidate for novel indications beyond parasitology, including applications in oncology and metabolic diseases.

Therapeutic History:
Pyrvinium pamoate was first approved by the FDA in 1955 for the treatment of pinworm infections and has been widely utilized in both biomedical and veterinary settings for its antihelminthic properties (Downey et al., 2008; Beck, 1964). Clinically, its safety profile is well established, with doses up to 35 mg/kg/day being safely administered for short courses. Its extensive therapeutic history also includes repurposing studies where pyrvinium pamoate has been evaluated for anti-protozoal activity—for example, its in vitro and in vivo efficacy against Cryptosporidium parvum has been well documented (Downey et al., 2008; Downey et al., 2009). More recently, pyrvinium pamoate has been explored for its antitumor potential, where its ability to inhibit mitochondrial complex I and to modulate signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt, mTOR, and Wnt have been emphasized (Hamilton & Rath, 2018; Momtazi‐borojeni et al., 2018). However, despite its well‐documented metabolic effects in cancer cells and its emerging role in obesity models through caloric restriction mimicry, there are no reports or clinical trials that have tested pyrvinium pamoate directly in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) or in ovarian granulosa cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cochran et al., 2024). Its established use in other indications underscores the strong safety data available for short-term applications, yet its application in chronic metabolic conditions such as PCOS remains purely hypothetical at this stage.

Mechanism of Action:
The primary pharmacological action of pyrvinium pamoate is inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. By binding within the mitochondrial inner membrane, the drug disrupts electron transport, leading to a reduction in ATP production and a concomitant increase in the AMP/ATP ratio. This energy depletion triggers activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master sensor of cellular energy status that initiates adaptive metabolic responses including enhanced fatty acid oxidation and increased glucose uptake (Fu et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021). In addition to its effect on mitochondrial respiration, pyrvinium pamoate has been demonstrated to modulate key signaling pathways. In cancer cell models, the drug markedly attenuates PI3K/Akt signaling, leading to reduced Akt phosphorylation, and indirectly suppresses mTOR signaling—the latter being critical for anabolic cell growth and proliferation (Momtazi‐borojeni et al., 2018; Schumacher, 2024). In some studies, pyrvinium pamoate also down‐regulates β‐catenin through enhanced degradation, although this mechanism is more relevant to its anticancer activity rather than its metabolic effects (Venerando et al., 2013). The net biochemical consequence of these molecular events is reminiscent of the cellular adaptations seen with caloric restriction; by invoking an energy stress that activates AMPK and concomitantly suppresses mTOR and PI3K/Akt, pyrvinium pamoate shifts cellular metabolism from an anabolic to a catabolic state. This modulation is particularly promising in the context of insulin resistance, a core defect in PCOS, as activation of AMPK has been shown to enhance insulin receptor sensitivity and promote glucose uptake in insulin-responsive tissues (Tong et al., 2022; Tsai et al., 2023).

Expected Effect in PCOS Granulosa Cells:
In the proposed preclinical model focusing on PCOS, granulosa cells are known to exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired insulin signaling, and aberrant activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Administering a low dose of pyrvinium pamoate is hypothesized to partially inhibit mitochondrial complex I in these cells. The consequent reduction in ATP levels increases the AMP/ATP ratio, leading to robust activation of AMPK. Activated AMPK then down‐regulates mTOR activity, thereby reducing cellular anabolic signaling and promoting catabolic processes that restore homeostasis (Zhou et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2021). In parallel, the suppression of PI3K/Akt signaling by pyrvinium pamoate may initially seem counterintuitive since Akt is a critical mediator of insulin action; however, the hypothesis is that mild inhibition of PI3K/Akt—if balanced with the overall metabolic improvement achieved via AMPK activation—could restore proper insulin receptor signaling. In ovarian granulosa cells, impaired insulin signaling is a hallmark of PCOS and is linked with altered cellular metabolism and reduced glucose uptake. Thus, by mimicking a state of caloric restriction, pyrvinium pamoate is expected to improve the bioenergetic profile of granulosa cells, restore insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt signaling, and ultimately enhance glucose uptake and metabolic function (Tsai et al., 2023; Wang & Li, 2023). This mechanism is supported indirectly by studies in other metabolic contexts, where low‐dose mitochondrial inhibitors have been shown to activate AMPK and improve systemic insulin sensitivity. Notably, the expression of insulin signaling components, including the insulin receptor and PI3K, has been well documented in granulosa cells of women with PCOS, making these cells a relevant model for testing the metabolic efficacy of pyrvinium pamoate (Tong et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
The rationale for repurposing pyrvinium pamoate as a novel therapeutic for PCOS is built on its established ability to inhibit mitochondrial complex I, activate AMPK, and suppress anabolic pathways such as mTOR and PI3K/Akt. A significant strength is its extensive clinical use as an antihelminthic, which provides a robust foundation of safety data from decades of use in humans and animals (Beck, 1964; Desai, 1962). Additionally, emerging evidence from cancer and obesity models suggests that low‐dose mitochondrial inhibitors can induce a caloric restriction‐like state, thereby improving insulin sensitivity—a key therapeutic target in PCOS (Fu et al., 2021; Schumacher, 2024). The candidate’s mechanism of action aligns well with the pathophysiological derangements in PCOS granulosa cells, particularly those involving mitochondrial dysfunction and altered insulin receptor signaling.

Nonetheless, there are notable challenges and limitations. First, the poor bioavailability of pyrvinium pamoate, owing to its low absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, may limit its systemic exposure when used for chronic metabolic indications. This characteristic, while advantageous in avoiding systemic toxicity for short‐term anti‐parasitic treatments, may necessitate alternative formulations or delivery routes to achieve effective concentrations in ovarian tissue (Ponzini et al., 2023; Schumacher, 2024). Second, while the safety profile is well delineated for its use as an antihelminthic, long‐term administration aimed at modulating metabolic pathways in a chronic condition like PCOS has not been previously studied. This raises concerns about off‐target effects, especially given that chronic suppression of mitochondrial function might adversely affect tissues with high energy demands. Furthermore, the demonstrated inhibitory effects on PI3K/Akt signaling, while potentially beneficial for reducing aberrant anabolic signaling, must be carefully titrated because complete inhibition of this pathway could exacerbate insulin resistance rather than ameliorate it (Venerando et al., 2013; Wang & Li, 2023).

Another aspect to consider is that although pyrvinium’s activation of AMPK is promising, direct evidence linking its use to improved insulin receptor function in ovarian granulosa cells is lacking. Preclinical studies in relevant cell types are required to determine whether the downstream effects observed in cancer or hepatocyte models translate effectively to granulosa cells, which have a distinct metabolic and hormonal milieu (Tsai et al., 2023; Tong et al., 2022). Lastly, given that current clinical trials for PCOS have focused on agents such as metformin and NAC, which have a well‐established mechanism for improving insulin sensitivity without significant off‐target mitochondrial toxicity, pyrvinium pamoate represents a more unconventional approach that will require rigorous preclinical validation before clinical translation can be considered (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cochran et al., 2024).

In summary, while significant promise exists in the approach of using low‐dose mitochondrial inhibition to activate AMPK and suppress mTOR signaling—a strategy that has been validated in other metabolic conditions—the repurposing of pyrvinium pamoate for PCOS is still highly experimental. Its long history as an anthelmintic and emerging data in oncology suggest a viable mechanistic basis, yet the issues of poor bioavailability, potential off‐target effects, and the lack of direct evidence in PCOS models form critical challenges. Further in vitro studies in cultured granulosa cells, combined with appropriate in vivo models of PCOS, will be essential to verify whether the metabolic benefits observed in other tissues can be recapitulated in ovarian tissue. If these preclinical studies are successful, pyrvinium pamoate could serve as a foundation for designing novel analogs with improved pharmacokinetic profiles tailored for chronic metabolic disorders such as PCOS (Momtazi‐borojeni et al., 2018; Schumacher, 2024). Overall, as an expert drug development team leader, I find that pyrvinium pamoate presents an intriguing and innovative candidate based on its mitochondrial targeting capability; however, its repurposing for PCOS will depend on overcoming substantial formulation and safety challenges while demonstrating clear metabolic efficacy in relevant ovarian cell models.
