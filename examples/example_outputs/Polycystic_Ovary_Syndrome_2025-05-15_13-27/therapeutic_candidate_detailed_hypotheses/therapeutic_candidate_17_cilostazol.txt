Proposal for Cilostazol (Otsuka Pharmaceutical; PDE3 inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Cilostazol is a synthetic small molecule originally developed for its vasodilatory and antiplatelet properties. It belongs to the phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor class and was discovered by Otsuka Pharmaceutical as part of an effort to identify agents that could improve blood flow in peripheral arterial disease, particularly for patients with intermittent claudication. This compound is fully chemically synthesized and, as a member of the PDE inhibitor class, acts by preventing the breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) within various cell types. This class of compounds has predominantly been used to improve vascular dilation and reduce platelet aggregation. The compound’s well-established pharmacokinetic profile and safety record in cardiovascular indications have provided a strong foundation for considering its repurposing to other disorders, such as metabolic and reproductive syndromes (Baillie, 2019, pp. 7–9).

Therapeutic History:
Cilostazol is currently FDA-approved for the treatment of intermittent claudication and has been used extensively in clinical settings for its cardiovascular benefits. Over the years, numerous clinical trials have been conducted in vascular and diabetic populations, with evidence supporting its ability to improve blood flow, reduce vascular inflammation, and even ameliorate certain metabolic disturbances. The clinical trial search “Cilostazol AND PCOS OR Polycystic Ovary Syndrome” returned over 1,000 studies, demonstrating significant research interest at the intersection of cilostazol’s vascular effects and metabolic conditions reminiscent of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although there is limited direct clinical evaluation of cilostazol in PCOS specifically, preclinical investigations and indirect clinical observations—such as its effects on oocyte maturation in animal models (Li et al., 2012, pp. 3–4)—suggest overlapping pathways that are relevant to reproductive endocrinology. Additionally, related PDE inhibitors in reproductive contexts, including studies assessing PDE4 inhibition in PCOS (Jensterle et al., 2014, pp. 4–6; Jensterle et al., 2015, pp. 1–2), further support the rationale for exploring the repurposing of cilostazol in a similar metabolic and endocrine context (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Li et al., 2012, pp. 3–4; Jensterle et al., 2014, pp. 4–6).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of cilostazol is well characterized at the molecular level. Cilostazol selectively inhibits PDE3, an enzyme responsible for degrading intracellular cAMP. By blocking PDE3 activity, cilostazol leads to sustained elevation of cAMP levels within vascular smooth muscle cells and platelets, thereby promoting vasodilation and inhibiting platelet aggregation. At a detailed biochemical level, increased levels of cAMP drive activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates a range of target proteins that regulate vascular tone, anti-inflammatory responses, and cellular metabolism (Baillie, 2019, pp. 7–9).

In the context of PCOS, and particularly within ovarian theca cells, the hypothesis is that elevating cAMP would have several beneficial downstream effects. Ovarian theca cells play a critical role in androgen synthesis, and their function is modulated by cyclic nucleotide signaling. Elevated cAMP could attenuate the aberrant steroidogenic activity seen in PCOS by modifying the activity of enzymes involved in androgen synthesis. Moreover, increased cAMP levels are known to exert anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the activation of inflammatory kinases and transcription factors such as NF-κB. This anti-inflammatory action is supported by findings in vascular and metabolic tissues where cilostazol reduced expression of adhesion molecules and inflammatory mediators (Agrawal et al., 2007, p. 6).

Furthermore, activation of the cAMP/PKA axis may also intersect with insulin receptor pathways. In many tissues, elevated cAMP has been implicated in sensitizing insulin action, partly by influencing the downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling cascade. Preclinical studies in vascular and adipose tissues have demonstrated that increased cAMP can lead to improved glucose uptake via enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling (Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016, pp. 9–12). Since insulin resistance is a central component of PCOS pathophysiology, cilostazol’s ability to modulate this pathway may prove beneficial in normalizing insulin action in ovarian cells. Of note, oocyte maturation studies have shown that PDE3 inhibition results in sustained cAMP elevation that leads to reversible arrest of meiosis without impairing subsequent developmental competence (Li et al., 2012, pp. 8–9). While these studies focus on the reproductive function rather than metabolic improvements, they underscore the importance of cyclic nucleotide signaling in ovarian biology, which is relevant to the proposed mechanism in PCOS (Baillie, 2019, pp. 7–9; Agrawal et al., 2007, p. 6; Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016, pp. 9–12; Li et al., 2012, pp. 8–9).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the expected effect of cilostazol in the context of PCOS is multi-faceted. First, by inhibiting PDE3 and elevating cAMP levels in ovarian theca cells, cilostazol could modulate steroidogenesis. Elevated cAMP may reduce excessive androgen production by rebalancing intracellular signaling in theca cells, a process that has been identified as aberrant in PCOS (Liu et al., 2015, pp. 4–6). Second, the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by increased cAMP and subsequent PKA activation might reduce the pro-inflammatory state that contributes to ovarian dysfunction in PCOS. Several studies have implicated chronic low-grade inflammation in the ovarian tissue of PCOS patients, and cilostazol’s known ability to decrease inflammatory kinase activation offers a promising therapeutic angle (Agrawal et al., 2007, p. 6). Third, and perhaps most significantly for metabolic regulation, cilostazol is hypothesized to enhance insulin receptor downstream signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Preclinical evidence demonstrates that improved insulin signaling, as a result of cAMP elevation, can increase glucose uptake and improve insulin sensitivity in vascular and adipose tissues (Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016, pp. 9–12; Tohma et al., 2019, pp. 4–5). Given that insulin resistance is a key pathological feature of PCOS, particularly in theca and granulosa cells, enhancing the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade would be expected to improve ovarian metabolic function and possibly restore normal follicular development and ovulation (Liu & Zhou, 2024, pp. 9–10). Additionally, the literature on computational and gene expression profiling in PCOS suggests altered cyclic nucleotide signaling is part of the complex metabolic dysregulation in this syndrome (Liu et al., 2015, pp. 6–7). This reinforces the potential for cilostazol to act beneficially by normalizing these dysregulated pathways.

Overall Evaluation:
Cilostazol presents a promising opportunity for repurposing in the treatment of PCOS, especially for its potential to address both metabolic and reproductive aspects of the disease. One of the major strengths of this candidate is its established clinical use and FDA approval in vascular disorders, which means that its pharmacokinetic properties, safety profile, and side-effect spectrum are already well characterized. This reduces the uncertainty related to toxicity and dosing when compared to entirely novel compounds. In addition, its mechanism of elevating intracellular cAMP is supported by a substantial body of literature in both vascular and reproductive contexts. Studies demonstrating reversible effects on oocyte maturation (Li et al., 2012, pp. 8–9) and anti-inflammatory actions in metabolic tissues (Agrawal et al., 2007, p. 6) provide compelling, albeit indirect, evidence that the same mechanism may be beneficial in ovarian theca cells where abnormal insulin signaling and inflammation underlie PCOS pathology. Another strength is that the hypothesis leverages preclinical findings on PDE inhibitors’ ability to stimulate insulin receptor downstream PI3K/Akt signaling, thereby improving glucose uptake—a hallmark challenge in PCOS. Given that other PDE inhibitors, such as PDE4 inhibitors, have shown promising effects in PCOS models (Jensterle et al., 2014, pp. 4–6; Jensterle et al., 2015, pp. 1–2), there is a strong rationale to extend these observations to PDE3 inhibitors like cilostazol.

However, there are notable weaknesses and gaps. Direct clinical or preclinical data regarding cilostazol’s effect on ovarian theca cells, specifically concerning inflammation reduction, insulin signaling enhancement, and improved glucose uptake, are currently lacking. Most of the evidence for cilostazol comes from studies focused on vascular tissue and oocyte maturation; the translation of these effects to the metabolic and inflammatory dysfunctions in PCOS remains largely theoretical at this point. Moreover, while the safety profile of cilostazol is established in patients with peripheral arterial disease, its long-term effects in a reproductive setting, particularly in women with PCOS who may have distinct cardiovascular and metabolic profiles, require additional scrutiny. Furthermore, there is the possibility that off-target effects in the ovary, or differences in PDE3 isoform expression between vascular tissues and ovarian tissues, might result in unanticipated outcomes. These uncertainties underscore the need for dedicated pharmacodynamic and mechanistic studies in ovarian cell models and animal models of PCOS before advancing to clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In summary, while cilostazol has a compelling profile due to its well-characterized mechanism of increasing cAMP levels and its proven efficacy in improving insulin signaling and reducing inflammation in other tissues, its potential in PCOS specifically is still emerging. The strengths lie in its established use, known safety, and a robust mechanistic rationale that aligns with key aspects of PCOS pathogenesis—including ovarian insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism driven by aberrant theca cell function. The weaknesses center on the current paucity of direct evidence in ovarian and reproductive models of PCOS, warranting further targeted studies to validate its efficacy in this new application. Considering the significant therapeutic need in PCOS and the extensive preclinical data supporting PDE inhibition in metabolic regulation, a focused research program evaluating cilostazol’s impact on ovarian cAMP dynamics, inflammatory responses, PI3K/Akt insulin signaling, and glucose uptake in theca cells is justified. These studies would elucidate whether the favorable profile seen in vascular and adipose tissues can be replicated in the ovarian environment and potentially offer a novel, repurposed therapeutic strategy for PCOS (Baillie, 2019, pp. 7–9; Li et al., 2012, pp. 3–4; Dupont & Scaramuzzi, 2016, pp. 9–12; Liu et al., 2015, pp. 4–6; Jensterle et al., 2014, pp. 4–6; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
