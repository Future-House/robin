Query: Studies reporting the use of insulin sensitizing small molecules in PCOS-derived granulosa or theca cell insulin uptake and signaling assays, including target validation data, mechanistic specificity, pharmacodynamics, and ADME/safety profiles

While several reports document the use of insulin‐sensitizing agents such as metformin, thiazolidinediones, myo‐inositol (MI), D‑chiro‐inositol (DCI), and berberine in the context of PCOS, the available literature consistently indicates that direct studies employing PCOS‑derived granulosa or theca cell models to measure insulin uptake and signaling are lacking. In essence, although insulin sensitizers are well characterized in terms of their actions on canonical pathways (e.g., PI3K/Akt, AMPK, MAPK) and are supported by clinical data, explicit target validation, comprehensive mechanistic details, pharmacodynamic parameters, and ADME/safety profiles derived specifically from granulosa or theca cell insulin uptake and signaling assays have not been reported.

For example, Wang and Li (2023) catalog a number of insulin‐sensitizing compounds and link them with relevant signaling pathways in PCOS. They mention agents like metformin (in combination with selenium nanoparticles), berberine, and myo‐inositol, which target the PI3K/Akt, MAPK, IL6/STAT3, and AMPK pathways. However, they clearly note that direct mechanistic specificity, target validation in isolated ovarian cell assays, detailed pharmacodynamic parameters, and ADME/safety data are not provided in their excerpt and that further primary data are required (wang2023signalingpathwaysand pages 18-19).

Similarly, the study by Cabrera‑Cruz et al. (2020) provides detailed mechanistic insights into myo‑inositol’s role by demonstrating its capacity to activate AMPK and increase GLUT‑4 expression in human endometrial cells exposed to a PCOS environment. Although the pathways explored—such as the involvement of the SMIT‑1 transporter and IPMK/LKB1-dependent AMPK activation—are central to insulin signaling, the investigation is limited to endometrial cells rather than granulosa or theca cells (cabreracruz2020theinsulinsensitizingmechanism pages 16-19).

Reviews by Davinelli et al. (2020) and Lauretta et al. (2016) similarly discuss the systemic and molecular effects of insulin‐sensitizing molecules (including the roles of metformin, TZDs, and inositols) on metabolic, endocrine, and even oncogenic endpoints. They refer to several mechanistic pathways that underlie the therapeutic action of these compounds, yet they consistently state that there is a paucity of data from direct insulin uptake or signaling assays conducted in PCOS-derived granulosa or theca cells. These sources specifically mention that the detailed target validation studies, as well as rigorous assessments of pharmacodynamics, ADME parameters, and safety profiles at the cell-specific level, remain to be detailed (lauretta2016insulinsensitizerspolycysticovary pages 14-15, romualdi2020whatisnew pages 5-6).

In addition, studies such as that by Gupta et al. (2016) have shown that pioglitazone enhances the insulin-stimulated release of a D‑chiro‑inositol-containing inositolphosphoglycan mediator in women with PCOS. While this supports the systemic insulin-sensitizing action of such molecules, it does not extend to direct assays involving granulosa or theca cells, nor does it provide comprehensive data on in vitro target engagement or ADME and safety profiles in these specific ovarian cell types (gupta2016pioglitazonetherapyincreases pages 1-2).

Finally, while broader reviews on ovarian insulin action (e.g., Diamanti‑Kandarakis and Dunaif, 2012) underscore that insulin signaling remains active in granulosa and theca cells despite systemic insulin resistance, these works do not furnish the detailed, cell-based experimental endpoint data (insulin uptake, signaling, and target validation) required to fully characterize the pharmacological profiles of these small molecules in ovarian tissues (diamantikandarakis2012insulinresistanceand pages 21-22).

In summary, the current literature illustrates the systemic and in vitro mechanistic actions of insulin sensitizers in PCOS via well-established signaling pathways, yet it lacks direct, detailed reporting on insulin uptake and signaling assays in PCOS-derived granulosa or theca cells complete with target validation, pharmacodynamics, and ADME/safety profiles. Therefore, further cell-specific studies are warranted to definitively establish these parameters (wang2023signalingpathwaysand pages 18-19, lauretta2016insulinsensitizerspolycysticovary pages 1-2).
