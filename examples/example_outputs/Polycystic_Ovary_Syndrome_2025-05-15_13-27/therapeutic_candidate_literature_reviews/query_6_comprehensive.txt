Query: Comprehensive analyses of insulin signaling pathway dysregulation in PCOS ovarian tissues: IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, PI3K-Akt pathway attenuation, GLUT4 translocation deficiency, including molecular mechanisms, genetic polymorphisms, and functional consequences in granulosa cells

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by a constellation of reproductive and metabolic abnormalities in which insulin signaling dysregulation plays a pivotal role, particularly in ovarian granulosa cells. (walters2022keysignallingpathways pages 1-2) In normal physiology, the binding of insulin to its receptor triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), which then activates downstream effectors such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt), ultimately culminating in the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and facilitating glucose uptake. (bednarz2022theroleof pages 5-7)

In PCOS ovarian tissues, however, this process is markedly impaired. Increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is a well-documented modification that inhibits its normal tyrosine phosphorylation, thereby diminishing its ability to properly recruit and activate PI3K. (alduraywish2024efficacyofmetformin pages 5-7) This aberrant serine phosphorylation is often mediated by inflammatory kinases and factors such as TNF-α, which activate serine kinases including JNK and ERK, further compounding the defect in IRS-1 function. (bednarz2022theroleof pages 4-5)

The subsequent attenuation of the PI3K-Akt signaling cascade is central to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in PCOS. (zeng2020polycysticovariansyndrome pages 11-15) Reduced activation of PI3K-Akt not only affects metabolic pathways critical for glucose utilization but also impairs cellular survival and proliferation signals that are essential in granulosa cells. (nisa2024molecularmechanismsin pages 5-7) The compromised activity of this pathway primarily results in a deficiency in the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane, thereby reducing glucose uptake. (wang2023signalingpathwaysand pages 5-6)

Genetic polymorphisms further exacerbate these molecular defects. Variants in key genes such as the insulin receptor gene (INSR), IRS-1, and possibly CAPN10 have been implicated in altering protein function or expression, predisposing affected women to more pronounced insulin resistance. (nisa2024molecularmechanismsin pages 4-5) Although specific genetic variants such as rs2059807 in INSR are not uniformly characterized across studies, there is a consensus that such polymorphisms contribute to the heterogeneity in insulin signaling efficacy and PCOS phenotype severity. (merhi2019implicationsandfuture pages 4-6)

The functional consequences of these molecular alterations in granulosa cells are far reaching. Reduced insulin signaling efficacy due to both IRS-1 serine hyperphosphorylation and downstream PI3K-Akt pathway attenuation leads to decreased GLUT4 translocation, culminating in impaired glucose uptake. (szukiewicz2022modulationofthe pages 13-14) This metabolic inadequacy in granulosa cells disrupts their normal steroidogenic function and compromises follicular development, contributing to follicular arrest and anovulation—a hallmark of PCOS. (wang2019hyperandrogenemiaandinsulin pages 6-9)

Moreover, the interplay between hyperinsulinemia and ovarian steroidogenesis further fuels a vicious cycle. Hyperinsulinemia itself, driven by systemic insulin resistance, can enhance ovarian androgen production directly and indirectly by lowering hepatic sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, which further increases free androgen concentrations. (alduraywish2024efficacyofmetformin pages 5-7) This hormonal imbalance not only perpetuates the insulin resistance but also exacerbates the reproductive dysfunction, resulting in a spectrum of clinical manifestations from menstrual irregularities to infertility. (wang2023signalingpathwaysand pages 1-2)

In summary, the converging evidence points to a central role of aberrant IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, the consequential attenuation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and deficient GLUT4 translocation as key molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance in PCOS ovarian tissues. These molecular defects, compounded by genetic predispositions, lead to significant functional impairments in granulosa cells that manifest clinically as disrupted folliculogenesis, hyperandrogenism, and anovulation.
