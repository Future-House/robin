Query: Longitudinal clinical and preclinical evidence correlating ovarian insulin resistance biomarkers with PCOS severity, reproductive outcomes, and metabolic profiles: identification of predictive biomarkers and molecular targets for rational insulin sensitizer development

Longitudinal clinical and preclinical evidence indicates that ovarian insulin resistance (IR) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is linked to a cascade of hormonal, metabolic, and reproductive dysfunctions, and that specific biomarkers may provide predictive insights for disease severity as well as targets for rational insulin sensitizer development (calcaterra2021polycysticovarysyndrome pages 10-11, dumesic2022polycysticovarysyndrome pages 1-2).

Hyperinsulinemia and ovarian IR in PCOS contribute significantly to hyperandrogenism by enhancing the activity of enzymes such as cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase (CYP17A1) in ovarian theca cells, resulting in increased androgen synthesis (calcaterra2021polycysticovarysyndrome pages 10-11). Concomitantly, reductions in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) amplify the bioavailability of free testosterone, thereby exacerbating clinical hyperandrogenism—all of which are key features of PCOS that can be tracked over time to assess progression and therapeutic response (genazzani2015pcosandinsulin pages 30-32).

The interplay between metabolic and reproductive abnormalities is further compounded by obesity-induced low-grade inflammation and lipotoxicity. Elevated free fatty acids (FFAs) and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) not only worsen IR but also disrupt follicular development and steroidogenesis (jeanes2017metabolicconsequencesof pages 3-4, amisi2022markersofinsulin pages 8-9). These inflammatory and metabolic markers, when monitored longitudinally, offer potential as early indicators of disease severity and progression in PCOS.

Additional predictive biomarkers include various adipocytokines released by adipose tissue. For example, adiponectin—particularly its high molecular weight form—is generally reduced in PCOS, correlating inversely with insulin resistance and affecting reproductive and cardiovascular outcomes (amisi2022markersofinsulin pages 8-9, jeanes2017metabolicconsequencesof pages 3-4). Other adipokines such as apelin, copeptin, and irisin have shown altered levels in PCOS patients, with their modulation by insulin sensitizers like metformin suggesting both predictive and therapeutic roles (amisi2022markersofinsulin pages 20-22).

Emerging evidence from clinical trials, such as the FEMAIL study (NCT04912648), is examining novel androgen subclasses like 11-oxygenated androgens (e.g., 11-ketotestosterone), which appear to maintain insulin resistance into later life and may offer further insight into metabolic risk stratification in PCOS (NCT04912648). Although this is one of the few longitudinal studies, it illustrates the evolving focus on integrating detailed hormonal profiling and non-targeted serum metabolomics to develop risk prediction models for diabetes and other metabolic outcomes in PCOS.

Furthermore, other biomarkers including fasting insulin levels, homeostatic model assessment indices (HOMA-IR), lipid ratios (TC/HDL-c, TG/HDL-c), and growth factors like hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in ovarian follicular fluid have been correlated with both ovarian dysfunction and adverse reproductive outcomes. Expression of markers such as the LH/FSH ratio has also been linked to oocyte maturation rates and infertility, providing additional layers of molecular insight for targeted insulin sensitizer development (genazzani2015pcosandinsulin pages 13-18, genazzani2015pcosandinsulin pages 18-21).

Novel adipokines such as lipocalin-2 and fibroblast growth factors (FGF19, FGF21) add to the complexity, with some studies indicating that they are altered in PCOS and may correlate with cardiovascular risk and diabetes progression (kruszewska2022reviewofnovel pages 1-2, kruszewska2022reviewofnovel pages 25-25). While findings across studies are sometimes contradictory, these markers underscore the multifaceted nature of PCOS and highlight multiple potential molecular targets—including insulin receptor signaling components and steroidogenic enzymes—for the rational design of insulin sensitizers.

Collectively, longitudinal studies underscore the importance of integrating metabolic, hormonal, and inflammatory biomarkers to stratify PCOS severity, predict reproductive outcomes, and guide therapeutic interventions. However, further robust, well-designed longitudinal clinical and preclinical studies remain critical to conclusively validate these biomarkers and molecular targets, ensuring effective and personalized treatment strategies for PCOS (amisi2022markersofinsulin pages 9-10, genazzani2015pcosandinsulin pages 26-28).
