Query: Genetic and functional studies linking androgen receptor signaling alterations and adipokine imbalances with insulin resistance in PCOS ovaries, focusing on molecular mechanisms driving impaired glucose uptake and signaling in ovarian cell subpopulations

Genetic and functional studies implicate altered androgen receptor (AR) signaling and adipokine imbalances as critical drivers of insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), affecting ovarian cell subpopulations responsible for glucose uptake and metabolism. Androgen receptor signaling, when dysregulated, disrupts normal insulin receptor (IR) activity by altering phosphorylation cascades critical for downstream signaling. Specifically, AR overactivity has been associated with increased serine phosphorylation and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of IR substrates—mainly insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins—which impairs activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. This pathway is central to insulin-stimulated translocation of glucose transporters, such as GLUT4, thereby reducing glucose uptake in ovarian cells such as granulosa and theca cells (zhao2023insulinresistancein pages 2-4, unluhizarci2021roleofinsulin pages 2-4).

Genetic studies reveal that altered expression of AR-related genes, including the downregulation of transcriptional repressors like ANKRD1, is linked to hyperandrogenemia and insulin resistance. In subcutaneous (SC) abdominal adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) from women with PCOS, differential expression of genes that regulate AR function and adipogenesis has been noted, with both upregulation and downregulation of AR-modulated transcripts. These alterations in gene expression correlate strongly with serum testosterone and insulin levels, suggesting that similar molecular disturbances in AR signaling may extend to ovarian cells and contribute to impaired insulin action (dumesic2019adiposeinsulinresistance pages 8-9, dumesic2019adiposeinsulinresistance pages 9-10).

Adipokine imbalances further exacerbate insulin resistance. Adipokines are bioactive peptides secreted by adipose tissue, among which adiponectin holds notable insulin-sensitizing properties. In PCOS, circulating levels of high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin are reduced, which in turn diminishes insulin sensitivity. The suppression of adiponectin secretion has been mechanistically linked to androgen excess, thereby reinforcing both systemic and local insulin resistance. Although the primary data derive from adipose tissue analyses showing that androgen-induced alterations in adipokine profiles contribute to dysfunctional insulin signaling, these mechanisms are likely mirrored in ovarian tissues where similar endocrine and paracrine signals regulate glucose metabolism (dumesic2019adiposeinsulinresistance pages 1-2, unluhizarci2021roleofinsulin pages 5-6).

At the functional level, studies have established that androgen excess induces abnormal gene expression patterns affecting lipid metabolism and extracellular matrix remodeling. These changes promote exaggerated lipid accumulation and adipocyte hyperplasia, mechanisms that are thought to disrupt normal insulin-mediated glucose uptake. In ovarian cell subpopulations, similar pathways may lead to impaired glucose utilization due to lipotoxicity and altered kinase activity that compromises the insulin signaling cascade. Animal models further reinforce the interplay between AR signaling and insulin sensitivity; for instance, global AR knockout rescues PCOS phenotypes by normalizing ovarian steroidogenesis and restoring insulin sensitivity, which underscores the extra-ovarian as well as intra-ovarian roles of AR in modulating insulin action (esmael2022greywickanew pages 81-85, parker2023pathophysiologicaleffectsof pages 16-18).

In summary, the convergence of genetic alterations in AR signaling and dysregulated adipokine secretion establishes a self-reinforcing cycle in PCOS. This cycle drives selective insulin resistance by impairing IR signaling pathways—principally the PI3K/AKT pathway—and consequently hinders glucose uptake in ovarian cell subpopulations. These molecular deficits offer a mechanistic explanation for the metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions observed in PCOS, further emphasizing the need for therapeutic strategies that target both androgen signaling and adipokine imbalances (dumesic2019adiposeinsulinresistance pages 6-7, zhao2023insulinresistancein pages 13-14).
