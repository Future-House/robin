Query: Mechanistic insights into the crosstalk between cellular energy sensors (AMPK, mTOR, SIRT1) and insulin receptor signaling in PCOS ovarian cell models: implications for targeted activation of insulin sensitization pathways and evidence of pathway-specific pharmacological modulation

The integration of cellular energy sensors with insulin receptor signaling in PCOS ovarian cells has emerged as a central mechanistic axis underpinning both metabolic and reproductive dysfunction. At the core of this crosstalk, AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis by sensing the AMP:ATP ratio and engaging catabolic pathways, while concurrently inhibiting anabolic processes via downstream targets such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (assaf2022roleofampkmtor pages 2-4). AMPK activation not only restores energy balance but also enhances the phosphorylation status of insulin receptor substrate components, leading to improved downstream PI3K/AKT signaling that is essential for glucose uptake and cell survival (tsai2023currentadvancesin pages 14-16).

In PCOS, disrupted energy metabolism is characterized by diminished AMPK activity and an overactivation of mTOR signaling. This imbalance results in aberrant insulin signaling, where impaired AMPK fails to sufficiently inhibit mTOR, thereby promoting excessive granulosa cell proliferation, altered steroidogenic enzyme expression, and insulin resistance (tsai2023currentadvancesin pages 16-17). Evidence indicates that pharmacological agents such as metformin, melatonin, and myo-inositol act by restoring AMPK activity; metformin, for example, inhibits mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, which leads to increased AMPK activation and subsequent reduction of mTOR phosphorylation (dabravolski2021mitochondrialdysfunctionand pages 6-7, cabreracruz2020theinsulinsensitizingmechanism pages 16-19).

SIRT1, a NAD⁺-dependent deacetylase, further coordinates this regulatory network by deacetylating upstream kinases like LKB1, thereby facilitating AMPK activation; reciprocally, AMPK enhances SIRT1 activity via its effects on cellular NAD⁺ levels (li2023regulationofsirt1 pages 6-8). This bidirectional relationship between SIRT1 and AMPK establishes a reinforcing loop that sustains metabolic homeostasis and mitigates oxidative stress—a key contributor to insulin resistance in ovarian cells (wang2023signalingpathwaysand pages 24-24). Furthermore, SIRT1 modulates the expression of genes downstream of PI3K/AKT, helping to rebalance insulin receptor signaling and improve glucose transporter expression, such as GLUT4, which is paramount for insulin sensitization (cabreracruz2020theinsulinsensitizingmechanism pages 19-22).

Additionally, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis, which is directly activated by insulin receptor engagement, is intricately linked with energy sensor pathways. Under normal physiological conditions, insulin binding leads to activation of PI3K and AKT, promoting GLUT4 translocation and cellular glucose uptake. However, in the context of PCOS, hyperactivation of mTOR driven by low AMPK activity disrupts this pathway, exacerbating insulin resistance and impairing follicular development (tsai2023currentadvancesin pages 9-11, wang2023signalingpathwaysand pages 8-9).

Targeted pharmacological modulation can selectively re-engage these pathways. Agents such as sulforaphane and other nutraceutical compounds have been shown to activate the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway, while traditional medicines like Guizhi Fuling Wan and modern compounds such as berberine act on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, offering evidence of pathway-specific modulation aimed at restoring insulin sensitivity (lee2023increasedigfbp2levels pages 8-10, giaccari2024anupdateon pages 8-9). This evidence collectively supports the potential of a therapeutic strategy based on enhancing AMPK and SIRT1 activity while concurrently dampening mTOR signaling. Such an approach could normalize insulin receptor signaling, reduce hyperandrogenism via improved granulosa cell metabolism, and ultimately ameliorate both metabolic and reproductive manifestations of PCOS (OpenTargets Search: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome-AMPK,mTOR,SIRT1,Insulin Receptor, tsai2023currentadvancesin pages 8-9).

In summary, the mechanistic interplay among AMPK, mTOR, and SIRT1 with insulin receptor signaling constitutes a fundamental pathway in PCOS pathology. The available evidence underscores that pharmacological activation of AMPK and SIRT1, alongside inhibition of hyperactive mTOR, can reestablish insulin sensitization—a promising target for therapeutic intervention in PCOS ovarian cell models.
