Query: Role of inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and hyperandrogenism in disrupting insulin-mediated glucose uptake and downstream signaling in granulosa and theca cells of PCOS patients: mechanistic studies identifying novel modulators of insulin sensitization

Inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and hyperandrogenism collectively disrupt insulin-mediated glucose uptake and downstream signaling in ovarian granulosa and theca cells through multiple interconnected mechanisms. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β are elevated in PCOS and initiate serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS), rather than the activating tyrosine phosphorylation. This modification impairs the insulin receptor’s ability to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, thereby reducing GLUT4 translocation and subsequent glucose uptake in ovarian cells (unluhizarci2021roleofinsulin pages 5-6).

Oxidative stress, characterized by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation markers such as malondialdehyde (MDA), further compromises insulin signaling. Elevated ROS levels induce the activation of stress-responsive kinases like c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and IκB kinase (IKK), leading to additional serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and exacerbating insulin resistance in granulosa and theca cells (sengupta2024polycysticovarysyndrome pages 3-4). Moreover, oxidative stress contributes to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by promoting protein misfolding and activating the unfolded protein response, which further diminishes downstream insulin signaling capacity (NCT02302326).

Hyperandrogenism, a defining feature of PCOS, aggravates these disruptions through its direct actions on ovarian steroidogenesis and by intensifying the inflammatory milieu. Excess androgens produced primarily by theca cells, often through upregulation of steroidogenic enzymes such as cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase (CYP17A1), have been shown to synergize with hyperinsulinemia, further impairing insulin signaling pathways. The heightened androgen levels attenuate insulin-mediated responses in granulosa cells by interfering with normal receptor function and downstream cascades, thereby contributing to follicular dysfunction and anovulation (NCT03229408).

Interventional studies have begun to identify potential modulators that target these mechanisms to restore insulin sensitivity. For instance, the anti-inflammatory drug salsalate has demonstrated the ability to inhibit nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB)-mediated cytokine production, resulting in a significant reduction in human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG)-stimulated ovarian androgen secretion and normalization of basal testosterone levels in lean, insulin-sensitive women with PCOS (NCT03229408). This finding underscores the therapeutic potential of directly targeting inflammatory pathways to normalize insulin signaling in ovarian cells.

Nutritional interventions also hold promise. Inositol stereoisomers, particularly in a 40:1 combination of myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol, have been found to act as insulin second messengers, thereby improving insulin sensitivity and ovarian function. Other agents such as vitamin D, zinc, and curcumin are being evaluated for their combined anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which may further restore proper insulin signaling by reducing oxidative stress and counteracting the deleterious effects of hyperandrogenism (NCT06551285).

On the molecular front, recent mechanistic studies have also identified novel targets including specific microRNAs (miRNAs) that modulate IRS expression or activity. For example, miR-145 overexpression has been implicated in inhibiting IRS-1 and MAPK/ERK signaling in granulosa cells, suggesting that modulation of miRNA expression may present a novel means to improve insulin signaling (kumar2023mechanismandrecent pages 6-8).

Overall, the interplay among pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative damage, and excessive androgen exposure disrupts the finely tuned insulin-mediated glucose uptake mechanisms in granulosa and theca cells through alterations in IRS phosphorylation, impaired PI3K/Akt signaling, and insufficient GLUT4 response. Therapeutic approaches targeting these pathways – whether through anti-inflammatory agents, antioxidants, or miRNA modulators – show promise in restoring insulin sensitivity and improving ovarian function in PCOS (sengupta2024polycysticovarysyndrome pages 3-4, NCT02302326).
