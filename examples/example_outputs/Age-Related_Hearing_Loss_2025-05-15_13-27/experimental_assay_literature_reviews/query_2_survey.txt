Query: Survey available in vitro cochlear cell culture models, including immortalized hair cell lines, primary organ of Corti explants, stem-cell-derived inner ear organoids, and co-culture systems, detailing their advantages, limitations, and suitability for mechanistic drug screening assays

Immortalized hair cell lines are a simple, reproducible in vitro model that facilitates high-throughput mechanistic drug screening by providing a homogeneous and easy-to-maintain cell population. However, these lines often fail to recapitulate the full three-dimensional architecture and complex physiology of native cochlear hair cells, which can limit their utility when detailed functional phenotyping is required (duranalonso2020stemcellbasedapproaches pages 5-6, shah2024moderninvitro pages 11-13).

Primary organ of Corti explants, derived directly from cochlear tissue, offer a far more physiologically relevant model due to the maintenance of native tissue architecture, intercellular interactions, and the presence of supporting cells in their natural microenvironment. This model allows researchers to observe authentic developmental stages, cell-to-cell communication, and responses to drug toxicity or regenerative cues. On the downside, these explants are limited by donor tissue availability, short lifespan in culture, and notable variability between samples, which restricts their scalability for high-throughput screening assays (duranalonso2020stemcellbasedapproaches pages 7-8, shah2024moderninvitro pages 9-10).

Stem-cell-derived inner ear organoids have emerged as a cutting-edge model that successfully balances the need for physiological relevance with scalability. These organoids are generated using human or mouse pluripotent stem cells (including hESCs, hiPSCs, mESCs, and miPSCs) through carefully orchestrated step-wise induction protocols involving key growth factors such as FGF, IGF1, and retinoic acid, along with modulation of Wnt and Notch signaling pathways. Such organoids recapitulate many aspects of inner ear development, including the formation of sensory epithelia containing hair cell (HC)-like and supporting cells, and are well-suited for mechanistic drug screening due to their capacity to mimic in vivo signaling, genetic disease phenotypes, and functional properties like mechanotransduction. However, these models often face challenges regarding heterogeneity and incomplete maturation, which may affect the precise modeling of cochlear-specific functions (duranalonso2020stemcellbasedapproaches pages 14-15, shah2024moderninvitro pages 4-6).

Co-culture systems represent another innovative approach that combines different cell types, such as hair cell-like cells with supporting cells or neural elements, to better mimic the complex intercellular interactions present in the cochlear environment. This multifaceted strategy improves the physiological fidelity of in vitro models by enabling studies of cell–cell connectivity, synapse formation, and paracrine signaling. Co-culture systems can be particularly useful for elucidating mechanistic insights into the integration and survival of transplanted cells in regenerative therapies, yet their inherent complexity may complicate assay standardization and throughput, thereby limiting their application in large-scale drug screening efforts (duranalonso2020stemcellbasedapproaches pages 10-11, shah2024moderninvitro pages 13-14).

Comparing these models, immortalized hair cell lines serve as an excellent starting point for preliminary screenings that require reproducibility and ease of manipulation, even though they often lack full native functionality. Primary organ of Corti explants are optimal when the aim is to study cell behavior in a near-physiological context, but their practical limitations—especially concerning tissue source and culture duration—can be a bottleneck in expansive screening studies. Stem-cell-derived inner ear organoids provide a promising middle ground, combining aspects of developmental biology with genetic and functional relevance, although further optimization is needed to achieve fully mature cochlear phenotypes. Co-culture systems, by incorporating multiple cell types, offer the most comprehensive simulation of in vivo conditions, yet they demand more intricate handling and pose challenges in standardization across experiments (duranalonso2020stemcellbasedapproaches pages 11-13, shah2024moderninvitro pages 10-11).

In summary, the selection of an in vitro cochlear cell culture model for mechanistic drug screening assays ultimately depends on the specific experimental requirements. Researchers must carefully balance the trade-offs between ease of use, physiological relevance, cell maturation, and scalability. Each system—immortalized cell lines, primary explants, stem cell-derived organoids, and co-culture platforms—provides unique advantages and in-built limitations, and a combined or hierarchical strategy employing multiple models may be necessary to comprehensively address the complexities of inner ear biology and advance therapeutic discovery (duranalonso2020stemcellbasedapproaches pages 15-17, shah2024moderninvitro pages 2-4).
