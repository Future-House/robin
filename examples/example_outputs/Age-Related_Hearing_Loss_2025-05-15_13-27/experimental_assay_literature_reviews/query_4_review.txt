Query: Review bulk and single-cell transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiling studies of aged versus young cochlear tissues to identify conserved targets and signaling networks that can serve as readouts in mechanistic high-content cell-based assays

Bulk transcriptomic studies comparing aged and young cochlear tissues have consistently revealed that aging is associated with a widespread downregulation of gene expression, particularly in mechanosensory hair cells. For example, Liu et al. demonstrated that both inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs) exhibit decreased transcriptional activity characterized by diminished expression of genes linked to DNA repair (e.g., H2ax, Mcm6), histone modification, and other epigenetic regulators. This reduction likely reflects increased epigenetic silencing during aging and has functional implications for genomic stability and hair cell specialization (liu2022molecularandcytological pages 10-11). In addition, bulk profiling by Liu et al. incorporated proteomic analyses via immunocytochemistry and advanced imaging techniques to correlate changes in key proteins—such as prestin (SLC26A5) and KCNQ4—with altered mechanical properties including reduced electromotility and compliance in OHCs (liu2022molecularandcytological pages 15-16, liu2022molecularandcytological pages 8-10).

Integrating these data with single-cell transcriptomics further refines our understanding of cochlear aging. Zhang et al. applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect cellular heterogeneity across cochlear tissues, identifying 18 distinct cell clusters. Their analysis revealed that aged cochlear cells display differential expression of genes involved in key signaling pathways such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. For instance, upregulation of factors like Enpp2 and Saa3 contrasts with the downregulation of Cxcl10 and Ccl5, suggesting that immune modulation is a significant component of age-related changes. Moreover, pathway enrichment highlighted the involvement of PI3K-Akt, Toll-like receptor, and Rap1 signaling, all of which are crucial for cell survival and inflammatory responses (zhang2024singlecellrna pages 2-4, zhang2024singlecellrna pages 7-9).

A complementary study using single nucleus RNA sequencing by Boussaty et al. expanded the cell-type resolution, identifying over 60 cochlear cell types in an aged outbred mouse model. This study not only confirmed conserved transcriptomic signatures involving oxidative stress and inflammatory responses but also suggested that specific subpopulations (e.g., subsets of hair cells and stria vascularis cells) are more vulnerable to aging. Their data support the premise that both genetic and epigenetic regulators implicated in bulk studies also exhibit cell-type-specific patterns, thereby serving as robust readouts in high-content cell-based assays (boussaty2023cochleartranscriptomeanalysis pages 1-2).

Additional insights come from transcriptome-guided drug repurposing studies by Schubert et al., which identified distinct sets of differentially expressed genes in various cochlear substructures. The dissection of transcriptomes from the organ of Corti/spiral ganglion neurons and the stria vascularis/satellite glia demonstrated that immune and neuronal regulatory networks are distinctly altered with age. These conserved targets, including signaling molecules involved in immune response and gap-junction function, are promising candidates for mechanistic readouts in high-content assays (schubert2022transcriptomeguidedidentificationof pages 4-6, schubert2022transcriptomeguidedidentificationof pages 7-9).

Although direct metabolomic profiling is less represented in these studies, the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic datasets with emerging metabolomic analyses—as suggested by the overarching multi-omics approach—could further validate conserved metabolic pathways (e.g., those linked to energy metabolism and oxidative stress) as readouts. In addition, data from the Open Targets Platform underscores several genetically and epigenetically associated targets (e.g., SLC26A5, CDH23) that have robust links to age-related hearing loss, providing additional layers of validation for use in high-content assays (OpenTargets Search).

Together, these studies converge on a set of conserved molecular targets and signaling networks—including transcriptional regulators (Cbx3, Foxo3), DNA repair components (H2ax, Mcm6), ion channels and motor proteins (prestin, KCNQ4), and inflammatory mediators (Trem2, Enpp2, Saa3)—which can serve as reliable mechanistic endpoints in high-content cell-based assays aimed at elucidating and eventually mitigating cochlear aging.
