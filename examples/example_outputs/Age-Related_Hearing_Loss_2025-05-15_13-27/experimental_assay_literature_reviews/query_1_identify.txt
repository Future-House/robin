Query: Identify and characterize the primary cellular and molecular mechanisms contributing to cochlear hair cell senescence and apoptosis in age-related hearing loss, including oxidative stress pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction, pro-inflammatory signaling, and DNA damage responses

Cochlear hair cell senescence and apoptosis in age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) arise from a complex convergence of multiple interrelated cellular and molecular mechanisms. The primary mechanisms include oxidative stress pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction, pro‐inflammatory signaling, and DNA damage responses.

Oxidative stress constitutes a central driving factor in ARHL. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated by both mitochondrial electron transport chain leakage and NADPH oxidases, overwhelm the cellular antioxidant defenses in cochlear hair cells. This overproduction of ROS induces lipid peroxidation, oxidizes proteins, and causes extensive damage to both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. The oxidative damage not only disrupts normal cellular functions but also directly contributes to apoptosis through activation of ROS‐sensitive signaling pathways (maniaci2024hearinglossand pages 3-6, paciello2023redoximbalanceas pages 7-8).

Closely linked to this oxidative milieu is mitochondrial dysfunction. In the aging cochlea, mitochondria exhibit impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reduced ATP production, and elevated ROS generation. Damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and alterations in key electron transport chain subunits (e.g., COX1 and COX4) create a detrimental feedback loop where mitochondrial defects amplify ROS production, further compromising mitochondrial and cellular integrity. This cascade ultimately activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway through the accumulation of pro-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins (such as Bax and Bak) and p53-mediated signaling, leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and subsequent cytochrome c release (bazard2021cochlearinflammagingin pages 9-11, ege2024theroleof pages 10-11, morrill2020lossofbcl6 pages 26-31).

Pro-inflammatory signaling further exacerbates cochlear hair cell damage. Sustained, low-grade inflammation—or “inflammaging”—is characterized by chronic activation of innate immune responses and the upregulation of cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-6. These cytokines activate downstream transcription factors such as NF-κB, which in turn promote additional ROS generation and further sensitization of cells to apoptotic cues. The inflammatory milieu can also predispose cells to alternative cell death modes like necroptosis, which, by releasing intracellular contents, perpetuate a cycle of inflammation and cell damage (bazard2021cochlearinflammagingin pages 9-11, paciello2023redoximbalanceas pages 19-20).

DNA damage responses add another crucial layer to this multifactorial process. The accumulation of DNA lesions—driven both by ROS and by impaired repair mechanisms in the aging cochlea—activates key sensor kinases (ATM and ATR), which then trigger downstream effectors such as p53. Activated p53 enforces cell cycle arrest, promotes the transcription of pro-apoptotic factors (e.g., PUMA), and, when damage is irreparable, pushes the cell toward apoptosis. In addition, persistent DNA damage in cochlear hair cells results in genomic instability and cellular senescence, both of which contribute to the gradual decline in auditory function (ege2024theroleof pages 2-3, ege2024theroleof pages 21-22).

In summary, the progression of ARHL is precipitated by a deleterious interplay of oxidative stress–mediated ROS production, mitochondrial dysfunction that fuels further oxidative injury, a pro-inflammatory environment that magnifies cellular damage, and cumulative DNA damage responses that tilt the balance from repair to apoptosis. This multifaceted pathological framework, underscored by evidence from multiple molecular studies, points to therapeutic interventions—such as antioxidants, mitochondrial rescue strategies, and anti-inflammatory agents—as promising avenues to mitigate cochlear hair cell degeneration in aging populations (ege2024theroleof pages 18-19, liu2022molecularandcytological pages 1-3, maniaci2024hearinglossand pages 14-15).
