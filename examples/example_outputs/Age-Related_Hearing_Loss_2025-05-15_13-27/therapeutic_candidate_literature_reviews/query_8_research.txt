Query: Research on the role of inflammatory signaling pathways (e.g., NF-κB, NLRP3 inflammasome, TNFα) in cochlear hair cell mechanotransduction impairment during aging: target expression changes, downstream effects on channel gating, pharmacological modulation, and reversibility in ex vivo and in vivo models

Research has demonstrated that chronic low‐grade inflammation—or inflammaging—plays a central role in cochlear hair cell mechanotransduction impairment during aging. In aged cochlear tissue, increased expression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL‑1β, and IL‑6, along with activation of NF‑κB and the NLRP3 inflammasome, lead to target expression changes that impact cellular function. Specifically, inflamma‐tory signaling reduces mitochondrial respiratory chain complex gene expression (particularly complex IV), causes mitochondrial ultrastructural abnormalities, and induces damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release (bazard2021cochlearinflammagingin pages 11-13).

Downstream, these inflammatory mediators disrupt ion channel function through multiple mechanisms. Chronic activation of NF‑κB and TNFα signaling contributes to the impairment of ion channels critical for generating the endocochlear potential. Altered expression and function of potassium channels (e.g., inwardly rectifying K+ channels) and Na,K‑ATPase can disrupt the ionic homeostasis required for effective hair cell depolarization and mechanotransduction (bazard2021cochlearinflammagingin pages 20-21). Furthermore, the subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction and increased ROS production promote oxidative stress, which further modulates channel gating kinetics and reduces ATP production necessary for ion transport (bazard2021cochlearinflammagingin pages 9-11).

Pharmacological modulation studies have provided insight into the reversibility of these processes. For example, dexamethasone (a potent anti‑inflammatory glucocorticoid) has been shown to protect hair cells by activating PI3K/Akt and modulating the NF‑κB pathways, thereby countering TNFα‑induced apoptosis. Aspirin and other anti-inflammatory agents are also under investigation for their potential to mitigate cochlear inflammation and preserve hair cell function (bazard2021cochlearinflammagingin pages 21-23, parekh2023cochlearinflammagingcellular pages 8-9). Experimental ex vivo cochlear explant and in vivo animal models indicate that these interventions can partially restore ion channel function and mechanotransduction capacity by downregulating pro‑inflammatory cytokines and reducing oxidative stress (xu2023intrinsicmechanismand pages 2-4).

At the molecular level, low concentrations of TNFα are able to activate NF‑κB signaling in a protective manner, promoting survival pathways in hair cells. In contrast, higher concentrations of TNFα trigger caspase‑3 mediated apoptotic cascades, resulting in hair cell loss and further mechanotransduction impairment. This dose-dependent duality underscores the need for precise modulation of inflammatory mediators (OpenTargets Search: Age-related hearing loss-NFKB1,NLRP3,TNF).

In addition, inflammatory signaling has been implicated in altering the expression of ion transporters such as NKCC1 and various potassium channel isoforms that are critical for maintaining the electrochemical gradients underlying mechanotransduction. These changes, along with the activation of the Na,K‑ATPase oxidant amplification loop (NKAL), lead to further ROS production and inflammatory cytokine release, establishing a cycle of cellular damage that ultimately impairs hair cell function (bazard2021cochlearinflammagingin pages 3-5, bazard2021cochlearinflammagingin pages 8-9).

Overall, the research indicates that targeting inflammatory signaling pathways—specifically NF‑κB, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and TNFα—can modulate the downstream effects on ion channel expression and gating in aged cochlear hair cells. Pharmacological interventions in both ex vivo and in vivo models have shown promise in reversing or at least ameliorating the mechanotransduction impairment associated with inflammaging (parekh2023cochlearinflammagingcellular pages 1-2, bazard2021cochlearinflammagingin pages 18-19). These findings suggest that modulating the balance between pro‑apoptotic and pro‑survival signaling through careful regulation of inflammatory mediators is a promising strategy for preserving or restoring auditory function in age-related hearing loss.
