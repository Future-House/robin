Query: Studies delineating genetic and functional validation of core mechanotransduction components (e.g., TMC1, LHFPL5, MYO7A, PCDH15) in ARHL pathogenesis, including knockout/knockin mouse models, hair cell electrophysiology, single-cell transcriptomics, and rescue experiments by gene or small-molecule intervention

Studies investigating the role of core mechanotransduction components in age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) have employed multiple complementary approaches to genetically and functionally validate targets such as TMC1, LHFPL5, MYO7A, and PCDH15. Although evidence from high‐throughput target–disease association searches (e.g., the Open Targets Platform) indicates only a modest literature‐based association for TMC1 and MYO7A with ARHL and no association for LHFPL5 and PCDH15, detailed functional validation studies have been conducted in other contexts that provide a solid foundation for understanding their roles in ARHL (OpenTargets Search: age-related hearing loss,presbycusis-TMC1,LHFPL5,MYO7A,PCDH15).

Genetic validation using knockout and knockin mouse models has been integral in delineating the function of these proteins in hair cell mechanotransduction. Mouse models harboring mutations—such as the Beethoven mutation in Tmc1 or targeted deletions of Lhfpl5—exhibit clear deficits in mechanotransduction currents and abnormal hair bundle morphology, leading to congenital or progressive forms of hearing loss. These models have allowed researchers to correlate specific genetic lesions with electrophysiological impairments in hair cells, demonstrating that loss or mutation of TMC1, LHFPL5, MYO7A, or PCDH15 disrupts the normal function of the MET channel complex (jung2023mechanoelectricaltransductionrelatedgenetic pages 1-3, trouillet2021loxhd1mutationscause pages 13-13, liu2021mechanismsincochlear pages 9-10).

Electrophysiological analyses performed on these animal models provide critical insight into the biophysical properties of the MET channels. By recording MET currents, investigators have determined that mutant hair cells usually display reduced amplitude or an absence of mechanotransduction currents. In addition, alterations in channel conductance, resting open probability, and calcium permeability, particularly in TMC1 mutants, substantiate the direct link between gene mutations and functional impairment of hair cell transduction (jung2023mechanoelectricaltransductionrelatedgenetic pages 3-4, zheng2021themechanosensorytransduction pages 9-11).

Single-cell transcriptomics has further advanced the understanding of the spatial and temporal expression profiles of these core genes in the cochlea. These studies reveal that TMC1, LHFPL5, MYO7A, and PCDH15 exhibit distinct expression patterns across diverse hair cell subtypes and supporting cells. Although such transcriptomic studies have been more extensively applied in non-ARHL contexts, they provide a crucial atlas that supports future targeted genetic studies in ARHL models by highlighting potentially altered expression dynamics during aging (smith2023differentialexpressionof pages 13-13, caprara2022mechanotransductioninmammalian pages 4-6).

Rescue experiments, employing gene therapy or small-molecule intervention, have also been explored in the context of these mechanotransduction components. In several studies, reintroduction of wild-type gene copies or the application of compounds that stabilize MET complex formation has resulted in a partial restoration of hearing function in mutant models. For example, transgenic expression studies in Tmc1-deficient mice have demonstrated that simultaneous expression of related genes or administration of candidate small molecules can rescue MET functionality, underscoring the therapeutic potential of these interventions in ARHL, even though the detailed rescue strategies have not been extensively characterized directly in ARHL-specific models (jung2023mechanoelectricaltransductionrelatedgenetic pages 15-15, zheng2021themechanosensorytransduction pages 9-11).

Finally, genome-wide association studies have begun to integrate monogenic hearing loss genes into the broader polygenic framework of ARHL pathogenesis. Although the genetic underpinnings of ARHL are complex and multifactorial—with contributions from environmental and lifestyle factors—the synthesis of knockout/knockin mouse model data, electrophysiological profiles, single-cell transcriptomic atlases, and preliminary rescue experiments collectively provide a robust mechanistic rationale for targeting core mechanotransduction components in ARHL (hernandez2022geneticsofagerelated pages 35-39, royce2025genomewideassociationstudy pages 20-22).
