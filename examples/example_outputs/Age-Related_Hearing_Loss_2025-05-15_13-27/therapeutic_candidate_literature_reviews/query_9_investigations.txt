Query: Investigations of age-related alterations in cochlear hair cell membrane biophysics, including lipid raft composition, membrane stiffness, and mechanotransducer channel gating properties, with potential identification of small molecules that modulate membrane fluidity to restore transduction

Investigations into age-related alterations in cochlear hair cell membrane biophysics reveal that modifications in lipid raft composition, membrane stiffness, and mechanotransducer channel gating properties are central to the declines observed in auditory function with aging (gao2022kiaa1024lminar2isessential pages 24-25). One pivotal factor is cholesterol, whose distribution within the hair bundles is tightly regulated by proteins such as Kiaa1024l/minar2; dysregulation of cholesterol is shown to affect membrane stiffness and lipid raft integrity, thereby modulating the mechanotransduction process (gao2022kiaa1024lminar2isessential pages 27-28).

The membrane biophysical changes are not static but dynamically regulated by components of the mechanotransduction (MET) complex. Specifically, TMC1 and TMC2, while traditionally known as pore-forming subunits, have been implicated in scramblase activity that lowers membrane viscosity, thereby facilitating rapid and efficient channel gating (george2024dynamicmodulationof pages 1-5). In the absence or malfunction of these proteins, as seen in various genetic models, altered membrane viscosity and increased stiffness have been documented, potentially leading to reduced energy transmission during sound transduction (george2024dynamicmodulationof pages 16-20).

The regulation of the lipid environment, particularly the balance between scramblase and flippase activities in the stereocilia, appears to be crucial for maintaining optimal membrane fluidity. Active scramblase function, which is dependent on the open conformation of MET channels, can dynamically decrease membrane viscosity, lowering the energetic barrier required for channel gating (george2024dynamicmodulationof pages 26-30). Conversely, an independent mechanism involving ATP-dependent lipid flippases can increase viscosity, suggesting that age-related shifts in the balance of these activities might contribute to the deterioration of hair cell function over time (george2024dynamicmodulationof pages 30-34).

In addition to intrinsic protein functions, pharmacological interventions that target membrane cholesterol levels provide further evidence of the critical link between lipid composition and auditory transduction. For instance, agents like hydroxypropyl-Î²-cyclodextrin, when misapplied, have been found to disrupt membrane cholesterol homeostasis, resulting in hair cell damage and hearing loss (gao2022kiaa1024lminar2isessential pages 27-28). This observation underscores the potential for identifying small molecules that are capable of modulating membrane fluidity in a controlled manner to restore proper mechanotransduction dynamics.

Investigations also suggest that age-related alterations in lipid raft composition, a factor influencing channel cooperativity and adaptation, may directly affect the gating properties of MET channels. Altered lipid raft domains can lead to changes in the spatial organization of the mechanotransduction apparatus, thereby reducing the sensitivity and response rates of hair cells (caprara2022mechanotransductioninmammalian pages 19-21). This interplay between membrane microdomains and channel kinetics forms the basis for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at counteracting the effects of aging on cochlear biophysics.

Given the complex modulation of membrane viscosity by scramblases, flippases, and cholesterol management, small molecules that specifically balance these interactions represent a promising approach to restore transduction functionality in aged cochlear hair cells. Future research is needed to identify and optimize such compounds, with the goal of reestablishing healthy membrane fluidity and robust mechanotransducer channel gating to mitigate age-related auditory decline (gao2022kiaa1024lminar2isessential pages 25-26, george2024dynamicmodulationof pages 44-46).
