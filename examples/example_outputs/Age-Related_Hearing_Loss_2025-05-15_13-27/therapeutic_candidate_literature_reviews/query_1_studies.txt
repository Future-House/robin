Query: Studies of small-molecule screening campaigns employing mechanotransduction assays in cochlear hair cell models of ARHL, including libraries tested, screening parameters, hit validation, target deconvolution, and performance in ex vivo organ of Corti cultures

Studies employing mechanotransduction assays in cochlear hair cell models for age-related hearing loss (ARHL) have developed multifaceted screening pipelines that integrate computational in silico methods with rigorous in vitro and ex vivo functional assays. One prominent approach used by De-la-Torre et al. focused on identifying druggable binding sites on the TMC1 protein—a critical component of the mechanotransduction (MET) channel—and on discovering small molecules that modulate its function. In this study, two compound libraries were interrogated: a massive non-FDA-approved ZINC20 library with over 230 million 3D compounds and an in-house curated set of 1,789 FDA-approved drugs. Compounds were preprocessed using LigPrep and Epik to simulate ionization states at physiological pH, and a two-step pharmacophore-based virtual screening (PBVS) was performed with an initial filter based on strict RMSD and molecular weight criteria. Hits meeting these criteria were further evaluated using Phase software to compute a Total-PhaseScreenScore (TPSS) and were filtered by docking thresholds determined as two standard deviations above the mean. These molecules then underwent molecular docking (via Glide with the OPLS_2005 force field) and binding free energy estimation using MM-GBSA to refine their predicted interactions at the TMC1 channel pore. Final candidates were validated in ex vivo cochlear explants using AM1-43 dye uptake assays to measure MET channel activity, ensuring that compounds directly modulated mechanotransduction without compromising hair cell viability (delatorre2025identificationofdruggable pages 16-18, delatorre2025identificationofdruggable pages 18-19).

Complementary studies by Kenyon et al. adopted a phenotypic screening campaign initially utilizing 10,240 compounds from the Life Chemicals Diversity Set. Their strategy began with zebrafish lateral line hair-cell assays at 25 μM, where hits were identified based on their capacity to protect against aminoglycoside-induced toxicity. These hits were further validated in mouse cochlear explants. Detailed electrophysiological recordings were performed to assess MET channel currents, and mechanistic deconvolution revealed that effective compounds often shared structural motifs—such as dual aromatic moieties bridged by cyclic amines (piperidine or piperazine) and benzimidazole groups—that were critical for high-affinity binding to the MET channel. In addition to electrophysiology, uptake assays using gentamicin-Texas Red (GTTR) confirmed that these compounds reduced aminoglycoside entry into hair cells, and in vivo experiments using transtympanic injections further corroborated their protective effects without adverse effects on bacterial sensitivity (kenyon2021identificationofa pages 2-4, kenyon2021identificationofa pages 10-12, kenyon2021identificationofa pages 14-16, kenyon2021identificationofa pages 19-20).

Additional phenotypic screening efforts, such as those explored by Chowdhury et al., concentrated on urea-thiophene carboxamide compounds. Their structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies, which involved over 300 analogs, pinpointed critical substituents—like the p-chlorophenyl urea moiety—that are essential for preserving hair cell architecture in the face of ototoxic insults. While these studies were primarily directed at aminoglycoside-induced damage, their optimization methodologies and validation in organotypic cochlear cultures provide further insight into compound performance in settings relevant to ARHL (chowdhury2018phenotypicoptimizationof pages 11-12).

Other complementary screening campaigns, including kinase inhibitor libraries and antioxidant screens, have employed neonatal organ of Corti micro-explants. For example, Ryals et al. used transgenic mouse cochlear micro-explants to test a series of kinase inhibitors at various concentrations to identify targets that modulate hair cell survival. Similarly, Noack et al. utilized an antioxidant screen to assess the impact of redox-active compounds on gentamicin-induced hair cell toxicity. Although these studies were conducted in models of acute ototoxicity rather than ARHL per se, their methodologies—including rigorous dosing, survival quantification, and precise electrophysiological and imaging techniques—offer a framework that can be adapted to ARHL research (ryals2017akinaseinhibitor pages 2-4, noack2017anantioxidantscreen pages 1-2).

In summary, the integrated pipelines combine high-throughput virtual and phenotypic screening with downstream hit validation in ex vivo organ of Corti cultures. These approaches include:
 • Large, well-curated compound libraries and rigorous in silico filtering methods.
 • Defined screening parameters such as precise compound concentrations, incubation times, and electrophysiological assessments of MET channel activity.
 • Target deconvolution via molecular docking, binding energy calculations, and structural clustering.
 • Functional validation in physiologically relevant ex vivo cochlear explants using dye uptake assays and electrophysiology to confirm the efficacy and mechanism of action against ototoxic insults, with implications toward ARHL interventions (delatorre2025identificationofdruggable pages 16-18, kenyon2021identificationofa pages 10-12).
