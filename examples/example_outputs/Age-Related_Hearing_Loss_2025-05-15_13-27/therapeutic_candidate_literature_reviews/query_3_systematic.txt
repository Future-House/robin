Query: Systematic reviews or meta-analyses of pharmacologic interventions aimed at modulating hair cell mechanotransduction channels (e.g., TMC1/TMC2 regulators), including evidence of functional rescue, direct binding assays, electrophysiological confirmation, and pharmacokinetic profiling in preclinical studies

The available evidence does not include any systematic reviews or meta-analyses that specifically compile and evaluate pharmacologic interventions targeting hair cell mechanotransduction channels, such as TMC1/TMC2 regulators. Most of the referenced studies are primary research reports presenting integrated in silico, ex vivo, and electrophysiological investigations rather than comprehensive evidence syntheses.

For example, De-la-Torre et al. (delatorre2025identificationofdruggable pages 1-3, delatorre2025identificationofdruggable pages 3-4, delatorre2025identificationofdruggable pages 12-14, delatorre2025identificationofdruggable pages 16-18, delatorre2025identificationofdruggable pages 36-40) describe an integrated pipeline that uses computational pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking with MM-GBSA binding energy estimates, and functional assays in cochlear explants to identify small molecules that modulate TMC1 function. Although the studies present evidence of candidate compounds that reduce AM1-43 dye uptake—a proxy for functional rescue—and include virtual binding analyses, they do not offer a systematic aggregation of data across studies. There is no meta-analytical synthesis of direct binding assays, electrophysiology, or pharmacokinetic profiling.

Similarly, the preclinical work detailed by Ma (ma2025protectiveeffectsof pages 3-6, ma2025protectiveeffectsof pages 6-6, ma2025protectiveeffectsof pages 6-8) focuses on the protective effects of MET channel blockers against ototoxic insults (e.g., aminoglycosides and cisplatin) and provides in vitro functional rescue data via dye uptake or electrophysiological measurements. However, these studies are presented as standalone investigations rather than parts of an overall systematic review or meta-analysis.

Further, while Rivetti et al. (rivetti2023aminoglycosidesrelatedototoxicitymechanisms pages 5-7), Breglio (breglio2017mechanismsofclinical pages 245-245, breglio2017mechanismsofclinical pages 47-52), and Kros and Steyger (kros2019aminoglycosideandcisplatininduced pages 8-9) provide important context regarding ototoxicity mechanisms and protective strategies involving MET channel blockers, none of these documents compile or synthesize preclinical evidence—including direct binding assays, electrophysiological confirmation, and pharmacokinetic profiling—into a systematic review or meta-analysis.

Finally, works such as Yang et al. (yang2025aforcesensitiveadhesion pages 19-20) and Zheng and Holt (zheng2021themechanosensorytransduction pages 21-25) further detail molecular and functional characterizations of hair cell mechanotransduction complexes but do not extend to systematic evidence gathering on pharmacologic interventions.

In summary, while there is a growing body of primary preclinical research that addresses the inhibition and modulation of TMC1/TMC2 channels through various experimental and computational methods, the literature provided does not include any systematic reviews or meta-analyses that meet the criteria of aggregating functional rescue data, direct binding assays, electrophysiological confirmation, and pharmacokinetic profiling for these pharmacologic interventions.
