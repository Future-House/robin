Query: In vivo and ex vivo studies of calcium homeostasis dysregulation in aged cochlear hair cells: altered expression or function of TRPV channels, PMCA, SERCA pumps, buffering proteins, impact on mechanotransduction adaptation, and pharmacological rescue strategies

A growing body of in vivo and ex vivo evidence indicates that dysregulation of calcium homeostasis in aged cochlear hair cells results from altered expression and/or function of key calcium‐handling proteins and channels, including TRPV channels, plasma membrane Ca²⁺‐ATPases (PMCA), sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺‐ATPases (SERCA), and calcium buffering proteins. These molecular changes impact the adaptive response of mechanotransduction, ultimately contributing to progressive hearing dysfunction.

TRPV channels, particularly TRPV1 and TRPV4, are integral to the regulation of calcium influx during normal mechanotransduction. TRPV1, when activated by agonists such as capsaicin, can lead to transient depolarization and subsequent alterations in hair cell responsiveness, while TRPV4 contributes indirectly, for example by influencing the endocochlear potential (Ramkumar2022Transientreceptorpotential pages 2-3, Forst2016CharacterizationofCation pages 172-174). Although the direct effects of aging on TRPV channel expression in cochlear hair cells remain less explicitly defined, the observed vulnerability of hair cells to acoustic overstimulation and ototoxic agents suggests that age-associated changes in TRPV channel function may exacerbate calcium overload and impair mechanotransduction adaptation.

The PMCA family, and specifically the PMCA2 isoform, plays a pivotal role in extruding Ca²⁺ from the cytosol. Aging appears to be associated with diminished PMCA2 function, which compromises Ca²⁺ clearance from the hair cells. Deficient PMCA2 activity has been linked to auditory deficits as even subtle reductions in PMCA expression are known to disrupt the precise Ca²⁺ control necessary for resetting mechanotransduction channels (Stafford2017ThePlasmaMembrane pages 9-10, Murtha2024AbsenceofOncomodulin pages 17-17). Reduced PMCA function results in elevated intracellular Ca²⁺ levels that not only disturb the dynamic regulation required for rapid adaptation of the transduction apparatus but also potentiate cytotoxic pathways.

Compensatory mechanisms appear to involve SERCA pumps. Studies in neuronal models have demonstrated that a decline in PMCA activity is frequently accompanied by an upregulation of SERCA isoforms, such as SERCA2 and SERCA3, which sequester Ca²⁺ into the endoplasmic reticulum. Although direct evidence in cochlear hair cells is limited, these findings from analogous systems suggest that increased SERCA pump activity may buffer the cytosolic Ca²⁺ overload but at the expense of altering calcium dynamics critical for rapid adaptation during sustained mechanotransduction (Boczek2019ThePuzzlingRole pages 14-15, Boczek2019ThePuzzlingRole pages 5-6).

Calcium buffering proteins, particularly oncomodulin, are also central to maintaining intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis. Oncomodulin, an EF-hand Ca²⁺-binding protein highly concentrated in outer hair cells, not only buffers intracellular Ca²⁺ but is precisely localized to regions critical for cell motility and synaptic signaling. The absence or reduction of oncomodulin leads to diminished buffering capacity, increased vulnerability to noise-induced cell death, and progressive cochlear dysfunction (Tong2016OncomodulinEFhand pages 1-2, Murtha2024AbsenceofOncomodulin pages 15-16). Such losses undermine the cell’s ability to respond adaptively during prolonged mechanical stimulation.

Pharmacological rescue strategies are aimed at restoring Ca²⁺ homeostasis to rescue mechanotransduction adaptation. Interventions include agents that enhance PMCA function or modulate SERCA activity to optimize intracellular calcium clearance. For example, the application of drugs that either promote rapid Ca²⁺ extrusion or prevent excessive Ca²⁺ accumulation in mitochondria may mitigate calcium-dependent cytotoxicity. Additionally, pharmacological modulation of TRPV channels using specific antagonists (e.g., capsazepine to counteract TRPV1-mediated Ca²⁺ influx) offers a plausible approach to prevent the deleterious consequences of calcium overload (Ramkumar2022Transientreceptorpotential pages 2-3, Forst2016CharacterizationofCation pages 172-174). Overall, these strategies underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting the molecular constituents of calcium regulation to preserve mechanotransduction fidelity in aged cochlear hair cells.
