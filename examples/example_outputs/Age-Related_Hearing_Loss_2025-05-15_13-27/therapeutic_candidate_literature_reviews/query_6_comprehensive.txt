Query: Comprehensive reviews of molecular pathways implicated in age-related cochlear hair cell mechanotransduction decline, focusing on oxidative stress, mitochondrial bioenergetics dysfunction, ion channel dysregulation, cytoskeletal remodeling, and altered membrane lipid composition with in vivo aging model evidence

Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is fundamentally driven by the degeneration of cochlear hair cells (HCs) owing to the convergence of multiple interconnected molecular pathways. Key mechanisms include oxidative stress, mitochondrial bioenergetics dysfunction, ion channel dysregulation, cytoskeletal remodeling, and altered membrane lipid composition. In vivo aging models provide strong evidence for these pathways, making them promising therapeutic targets.

Oxidative stress emerges as a central contributor to HC degeneration. Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during normal mitochondrial respiration overwhelm dwindling antioxidant defenses in aged cochlear cells, resulting in damage to mitochondrial DNA, proteins, and lipids. This oxidative damage activates apoptotic signaling cascades involving pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAK and BAX, thereby accelerating HC death. In vivo models—such as SAMP8 and C57BL/6J mice—demonstrate that increased oxidative stress correlates with elevated auditory brainstem response thresholds and overt cochlear degeneration (ege2024theroleof pages 2-3, ege2024theroleof pages 7-8).

Mitochondrial bioenergetics dysfunction is also key in ARHL. Aged hair cells show impaired mitochondrial function, with reduced ATP production and defective mitophagy that lead to a buildup of damaged mitochondria. Disruptions in key regulators like BNIP3L/NIX and DRP-1 undermine quality control mechanisms, which further intensify ROS accumulation and apoptotic events. These bioenergetic deficits directly compromise the energy-dependent process of mechanotransduction in hair cells. Experiments using in vivo aging models consistently reveal that mitochondrial impairments are strongly associated with hearing loss progression (ege2024theroleof pages 7-8, ege2024theroleof pages 11-13).

Ion channel dysregulation plays a critical role in diminishing hair cell mechanotransduction. Proper auditory processing relies on the precise regulation of ion channels, including Na,K-ATPase, NKCC1 cotransporters, and various potassium channels (Kir, Kv, and BK_Ca) that sustain the endocochlear potential. In the aging cochlea, reductions in the expression and function of these channels disturb ionic balance, leading to inefficient depolarization and impaired HC responsiveness. Animal studies over multiple in vivo models show that inflammatory processes and oxidative stress exacerbate ion channel dysfunction, thereby linking channel dysregulation directly to mechanotransduction decline (bazard2021cochlearinflammagingin pages 8-9, bazard2021cochlearinflammagingin pages 9-11).

Cytoskeletal remodeling is another factor influencing mechanotransduction efficiency. Structural changes such as stereocilia elongation, fusion, and disarray have been observed in aged hair cells. These cytoskeletal modifications adversely affect the mechanotransduction apparatus, further impairing the ability of hair cells to convert mechanical sound stimuli into neural signals. Although the exact molecular triggers for cytoskeletal changes require further elucidation, current evidence supports their role in the mechanical deterioration of the cochlea (ege2024theroleof pages 2-3, ege2024theroleof pages 3-6).

Finally, there is emerging evidence that altered membrane lipid composition impacts hair cell function. Changes in the lipid milieu of the HC membrane can affect its fluidity and the performance of embedded mechanotransduction channels. These modifications may disrupt the proper localization and activity of ion channels and receptor proteins, compounding the adverse effects of oxidative and inflammatory insults. While specific details on lipid alterations are less extensively documented than other pathways, the observed changes in membrane composition in aged cochlear cells point to an additional layer of mechanistic decline (ege2024theroleof pages 2-3, ege2024theroleof pages 18-19).

Overall, comprehensive reviews integrating data from in vivo aging models consistently highlight that the interplay among oxidative stress, mitochondrial bioenergetics dysfunction, ion channel dysregulation, cytoskeletal remodeling, and altered membrane lipid composition underpins the decline in cochlear hair cell mechanotransduction with aging (ege2024theroleof pages 21-22, bazard2021cochlearinflammagingin pages 1-2). This intricate network delineates multiple potential intervention points for the development of targeted therapies to mitigate ARHL.
