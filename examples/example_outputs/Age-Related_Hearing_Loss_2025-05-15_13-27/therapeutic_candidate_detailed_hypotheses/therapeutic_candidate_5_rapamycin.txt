Proposal for Rapamycin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rapamycin, also known as sirolimus, is a naturally occurring macrolide originally isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus and later developed as a potent inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) (Cortada et al., 2021). It belongs to the class of mTOR inhibitors, a therapeutic category that modulates cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, and autophagy by binding to the immunophilin FKBP12 and forming a complex with mTOR, thus blocking substrate access and downstream signaling (Fu et al., 2018). Historically, rapamycin was developed as an immunosuppressant to prevent organ transplant rejection and has since been repurposed in various areas including oncology and anti-aging research (Ege et al., 2024). Its discovery and optimization led to widespread clinical use owing to its demonstrated capacity to modulate key cellular stress and survival pathways, making it an attractive candidate for diseases with an aging component, such as Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) (Altschuler et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Rapamycin has an extensive therapeutic history, first entering clinical practice as an immunosuppressive agent and later being explored for its anti-proliferative effects in cancer due to its ability to inhibit mTOR signaling (Fu et al., 2018). In preclinical studies, rapamycin has shown significant promise in delaying aging-related phenotypes including improved mitochondrial quality control and enhanced autophagy, which are central to its proposed benefits in age-associated diseases (Ege et al., 2024). Specifically for hearing loss, a body of work in rodent models such as C57BL/6J and UMHET4 mice has demonstrated that dietary rapamycin can delay the progression of ARHL, preserve cochlear hair cell function, and reduce auditory threshold shifts (Altschuler et al., 2021). While rapamycin itself has not yet been approved for ARHL in humans, the compound’s repurposing has been supported by both preclinical biochemical and auditory outcome studies, and several clinical trial searches indicate emerging interest in its potential for treating sensorineural deficits (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At its molecular core, rapamycin exerts its therapeutic effect by binding to FKBP12, which subsequently interacts with the mTORC1 complex to inhibit its kinase activity; this inhibition downregulates phosphorylation of downstream effectors such as S6 kinase and 4E-BP1, leading to a global reduction in protein synthesis and cellular growth (Fu et al., 2018). In cochlear biology, mTORC1 has been implicated in the regulation of autophagy—a critical process for the removal of damaged proteins and dysfunctional organelles including mitochondria. In aged cochlear hair cells, dysregulated mTORC1 signaling is believed to result in impaired mitophagy, leading to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and consequent bioenergetic failure (Ege et al., 2024). By inhibiting mTORC1, rapamycin induces autophagy and stimulates the clearance of damaged mitochondria, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and the ATP-dependent functions required for effective mechanotransduction (Saegusa et al., 2020). This autophagy induction has also been linked to the removal of protein aggregates and improved lysosomal function in cochlear cells, thereby reducing oxidative stress and stabilizing ion channel dynamics critical for hair cell function (Fu et al., 2018). It is also important to note that while rapamycin predominantly targets mTORC1, excessive dosage may also impact mTORC2, leading to unintended effects on Akt signaling and hair cell survival, highlighting the need for careful dose optimization (Fu et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis proposes that by inducing autophagy, rapamycin will clear damaged mitochondria in aged cochlear hair cells, thereby reducing intracellular ROS levels and restoring the energy balance required for proper functionality of mechanotransduction (MET) channels (Ege et al., 2024). In the cochlea, efficient operation of MET channels is ATP-dependent, especially for processes like the PMCA-mediated Ca²⁺ extrusion and the gating mechanism that ensures proper mechanoelectrical conversion in hair cells (Altschuler et al., 2021). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that rapamycin treatment at appropriate doses (approximately 1–5 mg/kg in rodent models) leads to improved auditory brainstem response thresholds and delays the progression of ARHL, most likely by rescuing mitochondrial bioenergetics (Fu et al., 2018). Additionally, dosing studies in cochlear outer sulcus cells have shown that low-dose rapamycin can robustly activate autophagy without significant toxicity, suggesting that it is possible to achieve beneficial effects on mitochondrial clearance and ROS reduction at doses that are safe and well-tolerated (Saegusa et al., 2020). Therefore, in the proposed assay, we would expect rapamycin to improve mechanotransduction by facilitating the removal of damaged mitochondria, reducing oxidative stress, and restoring ATP levels, which in turn may enhance MET channel function and overall hair cell viability (Ege et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Rapamycin presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss, given its well-documented ability to modulate mTORC1 signaling—a pathway increasingly implicated in the pathology of cochlear aging (Fu et al., 2018; Ege et al., 2024). One of the primary strengths of this therapeutic candidate is its ability to induce autophagy and mitophagy, thereby clearing damaged mitochondria and reducing oxidative stress, which are both central to maintaining the bioenergetics essential for hair cell function (Saegusa et al., 2020). Preclinical studies in mouse models have shown that rapamycin can delay the onset of ARHL and preserve auditory function, which supports the mechanistic hypothesis proposed by our research team (Altschuler et al., 2021). Its prior use in other human diseases provides a wealth of clinical pharmacokinetic and dosing information that can be leveraged to design future trials for hearing loss, although its immunosuppressive properties and potential off-target effects at higher doses, particularly regarding mTORC2 inhibition, are notable weaknesses (Fu et al., 2022). Additionally, differential effects in various regions of the cochlea and in vitro studies showing potential hair cell toxicity at elevated dosages call for careful titration and monitoring of therapeutic windows (Leitmeyer et al., 2015). Overall, despite these challenges, the molecular rationale supporting rapamycin’s use in improving mitochondrial homeostasis and restoring ATP-dependent mechanotransduction in aged cochlear hair cells is robust and warrants further detailed investigation, both in extended preclinical studies and eventually in controlled clinical trials (Cortada et al., 2021; Ege et al., 2024). In summary, while rapamycin’s strengths lie in its well-established mechanism of inducing autophagy and its demonstrable benefits in delaying ARHL in animal models, careful consideration of dosing, potential immunosuppression, and the need to avoid mTORC2 inhibition are critical to its successful application in this novel therapeutic area (Fu et al., 2022).
