Proposal for Etanercept

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Etanercept (Enbrel®) is a biologic drug that belongs to the class of soluble tumor necrosis factor–α (TNFα) receptor fusion proteins. It is a recombinant fusion protein composed of the extracellular ligand-binding portion of the human TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) linked to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G₁ (IgG₁). Originally developed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and psoriasis, etanercept functions by binding circulating TNFα with high affinity, effectively sequestering the cytokine and preventing its interaction with cell surface TNF receptors (Rahman et al., 2001; Ren & Stankovic, 2018). The molecule is synthesized using recombinant DNA technology in mammalian cell expression systems, which ensures proper protein folding, glycosylation, and biological activity. As a member of the class of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), etanercept has been extensively used in clinical settings for addressing chronic inflammatory conditions; thus, its well-established safety profile and pharmacokinetic properties (with an approximate half-life of 70 hours) make it an attractive candidate for repurposing in other inflammatory-mediated diseases such as Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) (Rahman et al., 2001; Ren & Stankovic, 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Etanercept has a broad therapeutic history, primarily in the management of immune-mediated diseases. It was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and has subsequently been used for psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and plaque psoriasis. Extensive clinical data from these therapeutic areas have established both its efficacy and safety profile in modulating TNFα-driven inflammation (Rahman et al., 2001; Ren & Stankovic, 2018). In the auditory domain, although dedicated clinical trials examining etanercept for Age-Related Hearing Loss have not been registered—evidenced by the results from clinical trial database searches that yielded zero registered clinical trials for etanercept in the context of hearing loss—the drug has been investigated preclinically for its otoprotective potential (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical studies in animal models, such as those examining noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), have demonstrated that etanercept can improve cochlear blood flow, reduce inflammatory cytokine release, and preserve auditory function by mitigating microcirculatory disturbances in the cochlea (Arpornchayanon et al., 2013; Rodrigues et al., 2020). In addition, early-phase pilot studies in immune-mediated cochleovestibular disorders have explored its use, demonstrating some stabilization or modest improvements in hearing in conditions that have also been associated with inflammatory processes in the inner ear (Rahman et al., 2001; Matteson et al., 2005). However, in some trials—such as those in autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED)—the clinical efficacy for hearing improvement was only modest or inconsistent, suggesting that while modulation of TNFα signaling is a relevant therapeutic strategy, further work is needed to optimize dosing regimens and delivery methods for auditory indications (Pyykkö et al., 2007; Ren & Stankovic, 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
Etanercept’s mechanism of action is well-characterized at the molecular level. Under normal pathological conditions, TNFα is produced by various immune cells in response to inflammatory stimuli, and it exists in both a transmembrane and a soluble form. TNFα exerts its biological effects by binding to two primary receptors: TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), which contains a death domain and mediates apoptosis and inflammatory signaling, and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2), which is mainly involved in activating cell proliferation and survival pathways (Pyykkö et al., 2007; Ren & Stankovic, 2018). Etanercept acts as a decoy receptor by binding soluble TNFα through its extracellular ligand-binding domain, thereby preventing TNFα from engaging with its cell surface receptors and initiating downstream signaling cascades such as the activation of caspases and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Pyykkö et al., 2007; Ren & Stankovic, 2018). This blockade neutralizes the potent proinflammatory and pro-apoptotic effects of TNFα, including the activation of the TNFR1/TRADD complex that leads to caspase activation, mitochondrial damage, and eventual apoptotic cell death in target tissues (Aminpour et al., 2005; Ren & Stankovic, 2018). In the cochlea, elevated TNFα levels are associated with inflammatory damage, impaired microcirculation, and reduced functioning of Na,K-ATPase and potassium channels that are critical for maintaining the endocochlear potential (Parekh & Kaur, 2023). By sequestering TNFα, etanercept is expected to curb these deleterious pathways, protecting cochlear hair cells and the supporting structures from inflammation-driven oxidative stress and apoptosis (Ren & Stankovic, 2018; Kalinec et al., 2017).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underlying the repurposing of etanercept for Age-Related Hearing Loss is that by neutralizing TNFα, the drug will protect the mechanotransduction (MET) process in aging cochleae. In aged cochlear tissues, chronic low-grade inflammation, often referred to as inflammaging, leads to an increase in TNFα, which in turn activates death signaling pathways mediated primarily through TNFR1. This activation causes caspase-mediated apoptosis, increases ROS production, and ultimately triggers oxidative damage to key cochlear components such as hair cells and supporting structures. The resultant impairment in Na,K-ATPase and potassium channel function leads to a diminished endocochlear potential and a reduction in MET current amplitude (Parekh & Kaur, 2023). Preclinical studies have shown that local delivery of etanercept, such as intraperilymphatic injections in guinea pigs, can improve cochlear blood flow, preserve hair cell integrity, and mitigate threshold shifts in auditory brainstem responses following ototoxic insults like cisplatin treatment (Arpornchayanon et al., 2013; Mukherjea et al., 2015). Based on these findings, it is expected that etanercept will reduce the activation of apoptotic pathways and oxidative damage in the aged cochlea, thereby preserving ion channel function, maintaining the endocochlear potential, and ultimately protecting the MET currents necessary for normal auditory transduction. Considering that TNFα is known to be upregulated in various models of cochlear pathology, including noise-induced hearing loss and inflammation-related cochlear degeneration, the anticipated effect of etanercept would be to slow the progression of ARHL by reducing the chronic inflammatory environment within the cochlea (Ren & Stankovic, 2018; Kalinec et al., 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
Etanercept represents a promising repurposed candidate for the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss based on its established mechanism of TNFα blockade, its proven safety profile in systemic inflammatory diseases, and its preclinical efficacy in models of cochlear injury. One of the primary strengths of using etanercept as a therapeutic candidate for ARHL is its ability to selectively neutralize TNFα, a cytokine strongly implicated in the inflammatory and apoptotic pathways that contribute to cochlear degeneration. Its mechanism as a decoy receptor allows for the inhibition of TNFα-induced caspase activation and ROS production, processes known to impair both hair cell viability and the function of the Na,K-ATPase and potassium channels required to maintain the endocochlear potential (Pyykkö et al., 2007; Ren & Stankovic, 2018). Furthermore, etanercept’s established human safety profile and its relatively long half-life provide a considerable advantage over many experimental otoprotective compounds that may face challenges in clinical translation. The feasibility of localized dosing—such as intratympanic or intraperilymphatic delivery—could minimize systemic immunosuppression and maximize local therapeutic concentrations in the inner ear, as demonstrated by preclinical studies showing protection against cisplatin ototoxicity and noise-induced hearing loss (Arpornchayanon et al., 2013; Mukherjea et al., 2015).

However, there are also weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Although preclinical studies provide encouraging evidence, there is a notable absence of registered clinical trials specifically targeting etanercept for ARHL, and the clinical data from studies in immune-mediated cochleovestibular disorders have shown mixed results regarding hearing improvement (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rahman et al., 2001; Matteson et al., 2005). The translational gap from acute models of noise-induced or ototoxic hearing loss to the chronic, multifactorial pathology of ARHL remains significant. Age-related hearing loss is influenced not only by inflammatory pathways but also by numerous genetic, environmental, and metabolic factors that may limit the efficacy of solely targeting TNFα. Additionally, the optimal route, timing, and dosing regimen for etanercept delivery in the inner ear need to be rigorously defined to ensure that sufficient drug concentrations reach the target cells within the cochlea without causing off-target effects or systemic immunosuppression (Ren & Stankovic, 2018; Kalinec et al., 2017).

Another challenge is that while etanercept’s inhibition of TNFα is well documented in the context of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, its effects on mechanotransduction currents and ion channel regulation in the aging cochlea remain largely inferential and have not been subjected to extensive direct experimental validation. The hypothesis that etanercept will preserve MET currents by preventing TNFα-mediated disruption of potassium channel function and Na,K-ATPase activity is supported by preclinical data linking TNFα to cochlear inflammation and apoptosis (Parekh & Kaur, 2023), but further mechanistic studies are necessary. Such studies should encompass detailed molecular assays to assess ion channel expression, measurements of endocochlear potential, and evaluations of MET current amplitude in aging animal models treated with etanercept (Ren & Stankovic, 2018; Kalinec et al., 2017).

In summary, etanercept displays several compelling features as a candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss. Its synthetic origin as a recombinant TNFα receptor fusion protein, proven anti-inflammatory mechanism via TNFα neutralization, extensive therapeutic history in systemic inflammatory diseases, and supportive preclinical evidence in models of cochlear injury collectively position it as an attractive candidate for further investigation. Nonetheless, significant gaps remain regarding its specific application in the pathophysiology of ARHL. Future research directions should include rigorous preclinical studies using animal models of cochlear aging to directly assess the effects of etanercept on mechanotransduction, ion channel function, and endocochlear potential. Additionally, optimization of drug delivery methods to target the inner ear while minimizing systemic exposure will be critical for translating preclinical benefits into effective clinical therapies for ARHL (Arpornchayanon et al., 2013; Mukherjea et al., 2015; Parekh & Kaur, 2023). Overall, while etanercept shows promise based on its molecular mechanism and preliminary data in analogous models of cochlear damage, further comprehensive studies are warranted to fully define its role and efficacy in mitigating age-related declines in auditory function.
