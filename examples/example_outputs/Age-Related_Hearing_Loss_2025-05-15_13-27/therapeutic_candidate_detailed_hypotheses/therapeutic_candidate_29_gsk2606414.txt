Proposal for GSK2606414

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
GSK2606414 is a fully synthetic, small-molecule inhibitor originally discovered through efforts to target the unfolded protein response (UPR) at the level of its sensor, PERK (protein kinase RNA‐like endoplasmic reticulum kinase). This compound was developed by GlaxoSmithKline and belongs to the class of PERK inhibitors that have become instrumental in investigating the molecular consequences of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in neurodegenerative disease models. The synthesis of GSK2606414 involved high-throughput screening methods of chemical libraries with subsequent optimization for potency, selectivity, and in vivo bioavailability. Within the context of drug discovery, the PERK inhibitor class has traditionally been applied in preclinical models of neurodegeneration—such as models of Parkinson’s disease, prion disease, Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome, frontotemporal dementia, and tauopathies—where chronic ER stress and UPR hyperactivation drive cell death. As such, GSK2606414 stands as a prototype compound among PERK inhibitors (Gundu et al., 2022; Grande et al., 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, GSK2606414 has been explored extensively in the realm of neurodegenerative research. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in a number of preclinical studies where inhibition of the PERK pathway led to decreased phosphorylation of eIF2α and reduced levels of downstream pro-apoptotic factors such as ATF4 and CHOP. For instance, in models of high glucose-induced neurotoxicity, treatment with GSK2606414 significantly attenuated the PERK/p-eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP signaling cascade and improved mitochondrial function in mouse neuroblastoma (N2A) cells (Gundu et al., 2022). In mouse models of Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome and tauopathies, chronic administration of GSK2606414 resulted in neuroprotection, delayed motor deficits, and preservation of neuronal integrity (Grande et al., 2018). Despite these promising findings in neurodegeneration, a search on ClinicalTrials.gov for GSK2606414 or PERK inhibitors in the context of hearing loss has returned no registered clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). To date, there is no direct evidence from clinical or preclinical studies addressing Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) per se; however, the common pathogenic mechanism of chronic ER stress—leading to CHOP-mediated apoptosis—has been implicated in cochlear hair cell degeneration in ARHL and noise-induced hearing loss (Li et al., 2024). Thus, while GSK2606414 has a rich history in neuroprotective studies, its repurposing for ARHL remains an untested but mechanistically plausible hypothesis.

Mechanism of Action:
GSK2606414 operates by selectively binding to the kinase domain of PERK, thereby inhibiting its autophosphorylation and subsequent downstream signaling. Under conditions of ER stress, PERK becomes activated and phosphorylates eIF2α (eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha), a modification that results in global translational attenuation. This reduction in protein synthesis is initially adaptive, as it decreases the influx of nascent proteins into a stressed ER. However, prolonged activation of PERK leads to sustained eIF2α phosphorylation, increased translation of ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4), and ultimately induction of CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), a pro-apoptotic transcription factor (Gundu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2024). CHOP plays a pivotal role in ER stress-induced apoptosis by upregulating pro-apoptotic genes, downregulating anti-apoptotic factors such as Bcl-2, and contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction through further generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In several neurodegeneration studies, administration of GSK2606414 has been shown to reduce levels of phosphorylated PERK, eIF2α, ATF4, and CHOP, thereby mitigating apoptotic signaling and improving cell survival (Grande et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2015). Furthermore, by alleviating translational repression, GSK2606414 helps restore normal protein synthesis rates which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis, including the biogenesis and function of mitochondria—a process that is particularly important in energy-demanding cells such as neurons and auditory hair cells (Gundu et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
In the context of Age-Related Hearing Loss, the hypothesis is that chronic ER stress in aged cochlear hair cells triggers the PERK-eIF2α-CHOP pathway, leading to apoptosis and loss of mechanotransduction (MET) channel integrity. The expected effect of GSK2606414 is to attenuate the hyperactivation of this signaling cascade in cochlear hair cells. By inhibiting PERK, the drug would reduce eIF2α phosphorylation, thereby diminishing the upregulation of ATF4 and subsequent CHOP-mediated apoptotic signaling. This reduction in ER stress-induced apoptosis is expected to preserve the viability of cochlear hair cells and maintain the structural and functional integrity of the mechanotransduction channels, which are essential for auditory signal transduction (Li et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2016). Experimental data in neurodegeneration models have already shown that treatment with GSK2606414 at doses around 50 mg/kg can lower markers of ER stress and promote cell survival (Grande et al., 2018). Although direct preclinical evidence in auditory models is lacking, mechanistic parallels exist: similar to neuronal cells, cochlear hair cells are highly susceptible to ER stress-mediated apoptosis, as evidenced by increased CHOP expression in models of noise-induced and genetically driven hearing loss (Hu et al., 2016; Kalinec et al., 2014). Moreover, preservation of mitochondrial function by GSK2606414, through upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis markers, could further enhance cell survival in the metabolically active hair cells (Gundu et al., 2022). Thus, the drug is anticipated to act by downregulating maladaptive UPR signaling—thereby preventing CHOP-mediated apoptosis and preserving mechanotransduction channel architecture—which may translate into functional protection against ARHL.

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, GSK2606414 represents a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss due to its well-documented role in modulating ER stress and UPR signaling. The strengths of this therapeutic candidate include a robust mechanistic rationale: chronic ER stress leading to activation of the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP axis is a shared pathological feature in both neurodegeneration and cochlear hair cell loss. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated that GSK2606414 can decrease phosphorylation of PERK and its downstream effectors, thereby reducing pro-apoptotic signaling and rescuing cell survival in models of high glucose-induced neurotoxicity and mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases (Gundu et al., 2022; Grande et al., 2018). Given that auditory hair cells in the aging cochlea are particularly vulnerable to ER stress-induced apoptosis, inhibition of PERK by GSK2606414 may be a viable strategy to preserve these cells and maintain mechanotransduction channel functionality. Additionally, neuroprotection achieved in models of Parkinson’s disease and frontotemporal dementia further supports the potential utility of this compound in mitigating cellular loss due to chronic ER stress (Mercado et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2015).

However, significant weaknesses and challenges must also be considered. A major concern is the dual role of PERK signaling: while its chronic activation can lead to detrimental apoptosis via CHOP induction, the PERK pathway also has an adaptive function by attenuating protein load during acute ER stress. Therefore, complete inhibition of PERK may impair its protective aspects, which could lead to unforeseen negative cellular outcomes, particularly in tissues where a balanced UPR is critical (Athanasiou et al., 2017; Li et al., 2024). Additionally, side effects observed in neurodegenerative models—including pancreatic toxicity, weight loss, and off-target effects on kinases such as RIPK1—raise concerns about the long-term safety of GSK2606414 (Rozpędek-Kamińska et al., 2020; Mercado et al., 2018). The lack of any current clinical trials specifically targeting hearing loss with this compound further underscores the need for cautious preclinical evaluation in auditory models before moving to clinical stages (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Moreover, the specific dosing regimen, pharmacokinetics, and tissue distribution of GSK2606414 in the inner ear remain to be elucidated. While certain dosing paradigms (e.g., approximately 50 mg/kg in mice) have shown efficacy in reducing ER stress markers in neural models (Grande et al., 2018), the cochlea has unique anatomical and physiological properties that may demand a different therapeutic window. There is also the possibility that inhibiting PERK might inadvertently disrupt the delicate balance between pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signals in the aging cochlea, where the UPR is already dysregulated as part of the aging process (Li et al., 2024; Ege et al., 2024).

In conclusion, GSK2606414 holds significant promise as a candidate for repurposing in Age-Related Hearing Loss due to its targeted mechanism of attenuating the PERK-mediated arm of the UPR, thereby reducing CHOP-driven apoptosis and potentially preserving both cochlear hair cell viability and mechanotransduction channel integrity. The biochemical rationale is supported by extensive preclinical studies in neurodegenerative models showing that inhibition of PERK improves cellular survival and function (Gundu et al., 2022; Grande et al., 2018). Nevertheless, several critical challenges—including the potential for off-target toxicity, the dual nature of PERK signaling, and the lack of direct data in auditory systems—must be addressed through rigorous preclinical studies using relevant ARHL models. In parallel, alternative strategies such as modulating downstream effectors (for instance, the use of agents like ISRIB which act further downstream and may have a reduced toxicity profile) should be considered. Overall, while GSK2606414 is mechanistically attractive for combating ER stress-induced damage in aging hair cells, its translation to clinical application in ARHL will require careful dose optimization, side-effect profiling, and targeted delivery assessments to ensure that the beneficial effects on hair cell survival are not offset by detrimental systemic toxicity (Mercado et al., 2018; Park et al., 2024).
