Proposal for CDN1163

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
CDN1163 is a synthetically derived small-molecule drug belonging to the quinoline‐amide class of compounds that was discovered through high‐throughput screening methodologies employing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays designed to identify direct activators of SERCA (the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺‐ATPase). This molecule specifically targets SERCA2 isoforms and has been demonstrated to activate the ATPase activity of SERCA across multiple isoforms, including SERCA1a, SERCA2a, and SERCA2b. Its chemical structure, characterized by a quinoline core with amide substitutions, confers favorable cell permeability, metabolic stability, and a lack of significant off‐target activities on other ion channels, as established in several biochemical studies (Sordi et al., 2021). The general class of small-molecule SERCA activators has been explored predominantly in the context of cardiac and metabolic diseases, where increasing intracellular Ca²⁺ reuptake into the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) improves Ca²⁺ homeostasis and alleviates ER stress. Typically, drug candidates in this class have been screened for their ability to enhance ATP-dependent Ca²⁺ transport and to potentially reverse pathological conditions associated with Ca²⁺ dysregulation (Kang et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
The utilization of SERCA activators as therapeutic agents has been mostly centered around cardiovascular and metabolic indications. For example, compounds such as istaroxime have been studied to stimulate SERCA2a in the heart to improve contractility and relaxation in heart failure. Additionally, pyridone derivatives and other allosteric modulators have shown promise in preclinical models of diabetes and metabolic syndrome by reducing ER stress and correcting Ca²⁺ handling deficits. CDN1163 in particular has been demonstrated to significantly stimulate SERCA ATPase activity in native microsomal preparations and reconstituted proteoliposomes, with an effective concentration (EC₅₀) in the micromolar range (approximately 6 μM) and a reproducible enhancement of Ca²⁺ transport even under physiologically low Ca²⁺ conditions (Sordi et al., 2021). Although the clinical trial search using keywords “CDN1163 OR SERCA2 activator OR ATP2A2 AND hearing loss OR auditory OR cochlea” returned thousands of studies that underscore the extensive clinical interest in modulating SERCA2 for multiple disease contexts, direct clinical or preclinical evidence related to Age‐Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) is limited (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In the auditory field, there is emerging evidence that SERCA2 is expressed in cochlear hair cells and that its dysfunction may contribute to intracellular Ca²⁺ dysregulation associated with age-related degeneration (Li et al., 2018; Pinheiro et al., 2021). However, while SERCA activators have shown promise in other systems, there is as yet no comprehensive history of their direct use in hearing loss, with most evidence coming from mechanistic studies and analogies drawn from cardiac and metabolic models.

Mechanism of Action:
CDN1163 functions by directly binding to SERCA enzymes within the lipid bilayer of the ER/SR membranes. Mechanistic studies indicate that it interacts at a site likely located in the transmembrane domain of SERCA, where its lipophilic character enables it to stably associate with the membrane environment and modulate the protein’s conformation (Sordi et al., 2021; Seflova et al., 2024). Once bound, CDN1163 increases the ATPase activity of SERCA, thereby enhancing the rate of Ca²⁺ translocation from the cytoplasm into the ER. This improved Ca²⁺ uptake has been quantified as a roughly 30% increase in SERCA’s maximal activity under saturating Ca²⁺ conditions, with an observed potentiation even at low physiological Ca²⁺ concentrations (Sordi et al., 2021). The compound’s action is reversible, suggesting that its modulatory effects are allosteric rather than due to permanent modification of the enzyme. Importantly, studies have demonstrated that CDN1163 does not disrupt the functional interaction between SERCA and its endogenous regulatory proteins such as phospholamban (PLN), which is critical for maintaining precise control over Ca²⁺ cycling in tissues like the heart (Sordi et al., 2021). By promoting a conformational state of SERCA that favors Ca²⁺ binding and subsequent transport, CDN1163 accelerates the clearance of cytosolic Ca²⁺ and mitigates ER stress—a process that is critical in preventing cellular dysfunction in conditions marked by Ca²⁺ overload (Rahate et al., 2020).

At the molecular level, the compound exhibits a Hill coefficient near 3, which implies cooperative binding dynamics, possibly indicating the involvement of multiple binding sites or a conformationally sensitive transition within the SERCA protein. This cooperative binding contributes to the robust activation of SERCA activity, even at micromolar levels of CDN1163 (Sordi et al., 2021). Structurally, the binding of CDN1163 is thought to stabilize an “active” conformation of the SERCA enzyme, thereby lowering the activation energy for the conformational changes required for Ca²⁺ transport. This mechanism contrasts with traditional inhibitors of SERCA such as thapsigargin, which block the pump’s activity by binding to its Ca²⁺-binding sites and preventing Ca²⁺ translocation (Rahate et al., 2020; Seflova et al., 2024). Moreover, the compound’s supportive data from fluorescence-based assays provide evidence that the stereochemistry and lipophilic attributes of CDN1163 are crucial for its effective penetration of the lipid bilayer and subsequent engagement with the SERCA protein (Aguayo-Ortiz et al., 2021).

Expected Effect in the Assay and on Hair Cell Function:
The working hypothesis for employing CDN1163 as a therapeutic agent in Age-Related Hearing Loss is predicated on its capacity to enhance ER Ca²⁺ uptake and thereby improve intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis in cochlear hair cells. Aging hair cells are known to accumulate Ca²⁺ dysregulation due to a decline in the activity of Ca²⁺ extrusion mechanisms, such as PMCA2; to some extent, this is compensated by an upregulation of SERCA expression, although insufficient activity can still lead to Ca²⁺ overload and subsequent cellular stress (Pinheiro et al., 2021). In this context, CDN1163 is expected to robustly stimulate the SERCA2 isoform present in the ER of hair cells, accelerating the reuptake of Ca²⁺ from the cytosol. This action is anticipated to lower the amplitude of cytosolic Ca²⁺ transients during mechanotransduction, thereby preventing the deleterious downstream signaling cascades that lead to hair cell death and MET (mechanotransduction) channel adaptation failure. Indeed, evidence from biochemical studies shows that CDN1163 can lower cytosolic Ca²⁺ peaks through enhanced SERCA activity at concentrations around 10 μM (Sordi et al., 2021).

In the proposed assay, hair cells derived from aged animal models (or relevant in vitro hair cell models) would be treated with CDN1163 to evaluate its effect on intracellular Ca²⁺ dynamics, using Ca²⁺-sensitive dyes or genetically encoded calcium indicators. It is expected that treated cells will demonstrate reduced cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels and a restoration of normal Ca²⁺ transient kinetics, which are critical for maintaining the proper operation and adaptation of MET channels (Murtha et al., 2024; Dörje, 2024). Given the central role of Ca²⁺ in supporting mechanotransduction and synaptic transmission in hair cells, improved Ca²⁺ handling mediated by CDN1163 is also predicted to preserve the integrity of mechanotransduction currents that typically decline with age. Additionally, because intracellular Ca²⁺ overload is a known trigger for ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), enhanced SERCA activity is likely to reduce ER stress markers and slow down the degenerative progression in the cochlear sensory epithelium (Li et al., 2018).

The expression of SERCA2 in cochlear hair cells is supported by literature, and several studies have indicated that ER Ca²⁺ regulation is critical for hair cell survival. Although direct studies with CDN1163 in auditory models remain limited, the mechanism of action observed in cardiac and hepatic models can be extrapolated to suggest that SERCA2 activation in the cochlea may similarly improve Ca²⁺ homeostasis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Therefore, by lowering cytosolic Ca²⁺ peaks and normalizing the intracellular Ca²⁺ levels, CDN1163 could prevent the Ca²⁺ overload that contributes to MET channel dysfunction and eventual hair cell apoptosis, resulting in the preservation of hearing function despite the aging process.

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, CDN1163 is a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate that demonstrates significant potential for the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss based on its mechanistic role in restoring intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis. One of the primary strengths of CDN1163 is its direct and selective activation of SERCA2, which is pivotal for Ca²⁺ reuptake into the ER—a process that is compromised in aging hair cells due to decreased PMCA2 activity and other age-related alterations in Ca²⁺ handling (Sordi et al., 2021; Pinheiro et al., 2021). Its ability to stimulate SERCA activity in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner, while maintaining the integrity of SERCA’s interaction with its regulatory proteins, suggests that it is capable of enhancing Ca²⁺ clearance without disrupting normal cellular signaling pathways (Sordi et al., 2021; Rahate et al., 2020).

In terms of therapeutic history, while CDN1163 has been predominantly evaluated in the context of cardiac and metabolic dysfunction, extensive preclinical pharmacological studies have provided robust support for its capability to modulate intracellular Ca²⁺ levels effectively (Kang et al., 2016; Dahl et al., 2023). Although there is limited direct clinical or preclinical evidence in auditory models, the large number of related clinical trials targeting SERCA2 processes (as indicated by search queries) reflects a strong interest and potential for SERCA modulation across various disease contexts, including those affecting sensory systems. This translational potential, coupled with the mechanistic rationale that improved ER Ca²⁺ uptake can stabilize MET currents and protect hair cells from Ca²⁺ overload-induced degeneration, makes CDN1163 a compelling candidate for further investigation in ARHL (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Furthermore, the biochemical data indicating that CDN1163 enhances ATP-dependent Ca²⁺ transport with high potency (EC₅₀ around 6 μM) and demonstrates cooperative binding dynamics is suggestive of therapeutic efficacy at achievable dosing concentrations (Sordi et al., 2021; Seflova et al., 2024). Its favorable properties, including high membrane permeability and minimal off-target effects, further bolster its profile as a drug candidate for repurposing. One potential weakness, however, is the current paucity of direct auditory research that examines the effects of CDN1163 on cochlear hair cell Ca²⁺ homeostasis and mechanotransduction. While the extrapolation from cardiac and metabolic studies is promising, targeted in vitro and in vivo experiments in auditory cells will be critical to validate the hypothesis that SERCA2 activation can indeed preserve MET currents and prevent ARHL (Li et al., 2024; Park et al., 2024).

Another consideration is the need to establish a detailed pharmacokinetic and safety profile for CDN1163 in the context of the inner ear. Although its safety has been suggested in other models—particularly in terms of lacking cardiotoxicity such as hERG channel inhibition—specific evaluations in cochlear tissues are necessary to rule out potential ototoxicity or off-target effects on other ion channels critical for auditory function (Aguayo-Ortiz et al., 2021; Rahate et al., 2020).

In summary, CDN1163 represents a strong candidate for repurposing as a treatment for Age-Related Hearing Loss. Its mechanism—enhancing SERCA2-mediated Ca²⁺ uptake to stabilize intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis—directly addresses one of the molecular underpinnings of hair cell degeneration, namely, the failure of Ca²⁺ regulation leading to MET adaptation failure and cytotoxic cascades. The existing preclinical data in non-auditory tissues, combined with supportive evidence regarding the importance of Ca²⁺ handling in cochlear function, provide a robust rationale for advancing this compound into further auditory-specific studies. The strengths of CDN1163 lie in its potent, direct, and selective activation of SERCA as well as its favorable pharmacological profile, whereas its weaknesses include the current lack of direct experimental evidence in auditory models and the need for thorough in vivo safety and pharmacokinetic analyses in the inner ear. Ultimately, further detailed studies—both in vitro using hair cell assays and in vivo in animal models of ARHL—will be essential to fully validate its therapeutic potential for preserving mechanotransduction currents and preventing age-related auditory decline (Dörje, 2024; Li et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
