Proposal for Trehalose

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Trehalose is a naturally occurring nonreducing disaccharide, composed of two glucose molecules linked in an α,α-1,1-glycosidic bond, which is widely distributed in many organisms—including bacteria, fungi, plants, and invertebrates—but is not endogenously synthesized by mammals (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Traditionally, trehalose has been used in those organisms as a stress protectant because of its ability to stabilize proteins and cellular membranes under adverse conditions. Chemically, it is inexpensive and generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA, with extensive use as a dietary excipient and sweetener. Trehalose belongs to the class of carbohydrate-based therapeutic compounds and is increasingly recognized as an mTOR‐independent autophagy enhancer. This unique property distinguishes it from other autophagy inducers, such as rapamycin, which rely on mTOR inhibition and are associated with off-target effects including immune suppression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Lotfi et al., 2018). Trehalose’s capacity to promote autophagic clearance stems from its ability to activate the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, thereby enhancing the degradation of damaged proteins and dysfunctional organelles. Its molecular structure affords it the ability to interact with and stabilize membrane components, which is critical for preserving cell integrity under stress, and lends support to its potential use in conditions characterized by aberrant protein accumulation and membrane rigidity, such as age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) (Wang et al., 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Trehalose has been studied extensively in biochemical, preclinical, and clinical contexts for a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and certain lysosomal storage disorders. In these contexts, it has demonstrated the ability to reduce protein aggregation, clear dysfunctional mitochondria, and decrease oxidative stress via enhanced autophagy and proteostasis (Lotfi et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020). Preclinical studies using cell and animal models have shown that trehalose can reduce aggregation-prone proteins—such as alpha-synuclein, amyloid-β, and TDP-43—improving neuronal viability (Ye et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018). Although there are no registered clinical trials directly targeting ARHL with trehalose (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), the wealth of data supporting its neuroprotective and proteostatic effects in neurodegenerative models lays a strong translational foundation for its repurposing in the field of auditory research. Additionally, interventions that have been effective in other age-related neurodegenerative contexts may be particularly relevant for ARHL, given that similar age-dependent defects in autophagy and mitochondrial function are implicated in both conditions (Ege et al., 2024; Fu & Chai, 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, trehalose acts as an autophagy enhancer through an mTOR-independent mechanism. Unlike rapamycin, which inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and thereby indirectly stimulates autophagy, trehalose bypasses the mTOR pathway. Instead, trehalose directly facilitates autophagic flux in cells by activating transcription factor EB (TFEB), which serves as a master regulator governing lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy gene expression (Fu & Chai, 2019; Ye et al., 2019). Upon activation, TFEB translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where it upregulates genes involved in autophagosome formation, lysosomal function, and the clearance of damaged proteins and organelles. This process is particularly crucial in postmitotic cells such as cochlear hair cells, which rely on efficient autophagic clearance to maintain proteostasis and mitochondrial quality over the long lifespan of the cell (Ege et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023).

In aging cochlear hair cells, impaired autophagy leads to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, misfolded proteins, and oxidized lipids. These cellular debris, if not removed timely, can cause membrane stiffness and disrupt mechanotransduction—the process by which hair cells convert mechanical stimuli from sound waves into electrical signals. Trehalose is hypothesized to counteract these deleterious changes by promoting the clearance of aggregated proteins and defective organelles, and by restoring the normal biophysical properties of the hair cell membrane (Ege et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023). Moreover, by stabilizing membrane fluidity, trehalose may help maintain the dynamic behavior of mechanotransduction (MET) channels, which are essential for auditory function. Activation of TFEB has been associated with improved lysosomal acidification and function, further aiding in the degradation of cellular waste and providing cytoprotective effects in multiple neurodegenerative contexts (Fu & Chai, 2019; Lotfi et al., 2018).

Additional research supports that trehalose exerts beneficial effects without interfering with mTOR signaling pathways, potentially avoiding the adverse effects linked with mTOR inhibitors, such as immunosuppression. Instead, it induces autophagy by mechanisms that may involve stabilizing membranes and proteins directly and indirectly influencing other stress response pathways—from heat shock protein response to antioxidant defenses (Wang et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2021). Importantly, transcription factors and signaling molecules crucial for cochlear cell maintenance, including those associated with mitochondrial quality control (e.g., PGC-1α) and cellular antioxidative responses (e.g., SIRT1), may interact with trehalose-mediated autophagic mechanisms, thus preserving cell structure and function under conditions of age-related stress (Ege et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis is that trehalose, at a therapeutically relevant concentration—such as 100 mM in culture systems—will promote the clearance of damaged proteins and organelles in aging cochlear hair cells by enhancing autophagic flux, independent of mTOR inhibition. By stimulating nuclear translocation of TFEB, trehalose is expected to upregulate the suite of genes responsible for lysosomal biogenesis and the autophagy pathway, thereby facilitating the degradation of oxidatively modified proteins, fragmented mitochondria, and lipid aggregates. As a result, the buildup of cytotoxic aggregates that can stiffen the cell membrane and interfere with mechanotransduction channel dynamics will be reduced (Ege et al., 2024; Fu & Chai, 2019).

In practical terms, in vitro assays (e.g., using cultured cochlear hair cells or auditory cell lines) should reveal an increase in autophagy markers such as LC3-II and a decrease in the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins upon trehalose treatment. Additionally, activation and nuclear localization of TFEB can be monitored through immunofluorescence assays, with expectations of a significant increase in nuclear TFEB signal after treatment with trehalose (Ye et al., 2019; Fu & Chai, 2019). The removal of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy should help restore mitochondrial membrane potential and overall energy homeostasis in these cells, thereby protecting against further oxidative injury. This restoration is crucial because mitochondrial dysfunction is a key driver of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which exacerbates cellular damage and contributes to the progression of ARHL (Li et al., 2023).

Regarding mechanotransduction channels, well-maintained membrane fluidity underlies the rapid conformational changes of the MET channels, essential for converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals in auditory hair cells. Trehalose’s ability to stabilize membranes is expected to preserve this fluidity, thereby maintaining proper MET channel gating and ensuring normal auditory function. The anticipated outcome is that long-term trehalose administration, by preserving the structural and functional integrity of cochlear hair cells, would slow or even prevent the progression of ARHL in preclinical models (Ege et al., 2024; Tavanai et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Trehalose emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss based on an extensive body of preclinical evidence that highlights the significance of autophagy and proteostasis in maintaining cochlear cell integrity. One of the strengths of trehalose is its ability to enhance autophagy through an mTOR-independent pathway, which specifically involves the activation and nuclear translocation of TFEB. This mechanism not only facilitates the clearance of damaged and aggregated proteins and mitochondria but also helps maintain membrane fluidity—an essential factor for the proper function of mechanotransduction channels in cochlear hair cells (Fu & Chai, 2019; Ege et al., 2024).

Additionally, trehalose has a well-established safety profile, partly because it has been used as a dietary supplement and excipient for many years, reducing the risk associated with early translational studies in ARHL. Its protective effects in models of neurodegenerative diseases, where proteostasis and autophagic dysfunction are central to the pathology, further support the hypothesis that it could be beneficial in the context of ARHL (Lotfi et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020).

However, several challenges remain. First, while there is abundant preclinical evidence of trehalose’s autophagy-inducing capacity in various neurodegenerative contexts, direct evidence in models of age-related hearing loss is sparse. Clinical trials specifically targeting ARHL using trehalose are lacking, and it remains to be seen whether the mechanisms observed in neuronal and other postmitotic cells are fully translatable to cochlear hair cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ege et al., 2024). Second, the optimal dosing, administration route (e.g., oral versus intravenous), and long-term safety profile specific to the auditory system require further investigation. The concentration of trehalose that effectively induces autophagy in vitro (e.g., 100 mM) may not directly translate into a feasible dosing regimen in vivo without further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies (Fu & Chai, 2019; Tavanai et al., 2024).

Moreover, while activation of TFEB is a promising mechanism for enhancing lysosomal and autophagic function, the complex interplay between autophagy, cellular senescence, and apoptosis in aging cochlear cells necessitates careful evaluation. Overactivation of autophagy could, under certain circumstances, lead to autophagic cell death if not properly regulated (Ege et al., 2024; He et al., 2021).

Another consideration is the long-term impact of trehalose on mitochondrial quality control. Since mitochondrial dysfunction is a major contributor to ARHL—with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative damage—the ability of trehalose to restore mitochondrial dynamics is of paramount importance. Evidence from related studies suggests that enhanced autophagy via TFEB activation promotes mitophagy and reduces oxidative stress (Li et al., 2023).

Finally, despite the strong theoretical foundation for repurposing trehalose in ARHL, the translation from cell culture and non-auditory models to preclinical animal models of hearing loss remains an essential step. The auditory system has unique physiological and biophysical characteristics; thus, demonstration of efficacy in an appropriate ARHL model is crucial to validate the hypothesis that trehalose can preserve mechanotransduction channel dynamics by maintaining membrane fluidity and cytoskeletal architecture (Ege et al., 2024; Tavanai et al., 2024).

In summary, the overall evaluation of trehalose as a therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss is promising. Its distinct mechanism of mTOR-independent autophagy enhancement via TFEB activation offers a targeted method to promote proteostasis, mitochondrial quality control, and the preservation of membrane fluidity in aging cochlear hair cells (Fu & Chai, 2019; Ege et al., 2024). The strengths of trehalose include its natural origin, excellent safety profile, and demonstrated efficacy in reducing protein aggregation and oxidative stress in multiple neurodegenerative models (Lotfi et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020). However, significant gaps remain in the direct application of trehalose to ARHL models, particularly regarding dosing, long-term safety in the auditory system, and the precise interplay of autophagic mechanisms in cochlear cells. Future research must focus on preclinical studies using appropriate animal models of ARHL, detailed analyses of mitochondrial and membrane biophysics in the cochlea, and eventually, clinical trials to establish its efficacy and safety for hearing preservation (Ege et al., 2024; Tavanai et al., 2024).

Overall, trehalose remains a strong candidate for repurposing to treat ARHL, but its translational potential will depend on bridging the gap between the promising molecular mechanisms observed in vitro and in non-auditory models, and robust preclinical and clinical evidence in auditory systems. This candidate merits further detailed investigation and could offer an innovative strategy for protecting cochlear hair cells from age-related degeneration through enhancement of autophagic clearance and maintenance of membrane dynamics (Ege et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2015).
