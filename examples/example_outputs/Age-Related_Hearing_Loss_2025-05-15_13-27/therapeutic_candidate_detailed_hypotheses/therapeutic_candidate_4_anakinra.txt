Proposal for Anakinra

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Anakinra is a recombinant human interleukin‐1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) developed as a biologic drug that competitively binds to the type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1), thereby preventing its interaction with the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-1α. It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in bacterial or eukaryotic expression systems and marketed under the trade name Kineret®. This therapeutic candidate falls within the class of biologics and, more specifically, cytokine inhibitors, which have been commonly employed for the treatment of several inflammatory conditions. The molecular design of Anakinra is based on the natural human IL-1Ra protein but with slight modifications that facilitate its stability and allow for consistent production in cell-based systems. Being a synthetic protein, it bypasses the potential antigenicity associated with non-human-derived compounds, which has proven crucial for its acceptance in clinical practice. This class of compounds has previously been used in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, autoinflammatory syndromes (e.g., Muckle-Wells syndrome), and autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED), where chronic inflammation is a prominent disease driver (Dinarello, 2018; Cavalli & Dinarello, 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Anakinra has been well studied in several inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Clinically, it has been administered to patients with rheumatoid arthritis and various autoinflammatory disorders—including cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) such as Muckle-Wells syndrome—and has demonstrated pronounced efficacy in reducing systemic inflammation by neutralizing IL-1 signaling (Dinarello, 2018; Cavalli & Dinarello, 2018). There is a well-documented clinical precedent for its use in steroid-resistant autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED), where its capacity to block IL-1β has resulted in clinically measurable improvements in audiometric parameters. For example, clinical trials utilizing Anakinra in patients with corticosteroid-resistant AIED have indicated improved hearing thresholds and stabilization of inflammatory marker profiles (Chang et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although its established historical use has primarily focused on autoimmune and other inflammatory conditions—in particular where NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays a role—there is, to date, no direct clinical application of Anakinra in treating Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) per se. However, the immunomodulatory rationale extended from its success in autoimmune inner ear disorders suggests an opportunity for repurposing Anakinra to target the inflammatory component of ARHL, especially given the growing evidence implicating IL-1-driven inflammation and inflammasome activation in cochlear aging (Cavalli & Dinarello, 2018; Mukherjea et al., 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Anakinra exerts its effects by binding to the IL-1R1 receptor with high affinity, preventing the binding and subsequent signaling of both IL-1β and IL-1α. Under physiological conditions, binding of IL-1β/IL-1α to IL-1R1 triggers downstream cascades that culminate in the activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways, propagating an inflammatory response through upregulation of additional cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. By competitively inhibiting this receptor, Anakinra essentially intercepts the inflammatory signal at an early stage, thereby reducing the activation of caspase-1 and subsequent processing of pro-IL-1β into its mature form. This action not only dampens inflammation but also indirectly interferes with inflammasome activation, notably the NLRP3 inflammasome, which has been shown to be closely linked with mitochondrial dysfunction and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cochlear cells (Guo et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023). On a biochemical level, the interruption of IL-1 signaling mitigates the inflammatory cascade that would otherwise lead to increased mitochondrial ROS production. Elevated ROS levels are known to impair the functionality of critical ion pumps such as plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), consequentially disturbing intracellular calcium homeostasis—a key factor in the mechanotransduction process of cochlear hair cells. Therefore, by preventing these downstream events, Anakinra may help preserve the structural and functional integrity of hair cell mechanotransduction machinery, potentially reducing inflammatory stress-induced ion channel dysregulation and mitochondrial impairment observed in aging cells (Hu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis under evaluation posits that Anakinra’s inhibition of IL-1β/IL-1α signaling will prevent the inflammasome-driven inflammatory cascade in the aging cochlea, thereby preserving hair cell mechanotransduction. In practical terms, the expected outcome is that by blocking the initiation of IL-1-dependent inflammatory responses, Anakinra will reduce mitochondrial dysfunction—a key event triggered by excessive ROS generation—and thereby maintain the proper function of ion channels that are essential for the specialized mechanotransduction currents in cochlear hair cells. This preservation of ion homeostasis is critical because aberrant calcium signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction have been strongly implicated in the pathology of ARHL, where chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) contributes to the deterioration of cochlear structures (Qiu et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2023). Additionally, evidence from in vivo animal studies suggests that IL-1 receptor antagonism can mitigate inflammatory cell infiltration and reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, which are central to the cascade resulting in hair cell degeneration. Although direct studies measuring the preservation of mechanotransduction in aged hair cells following Anakinra treatment are currently limited, the mechanistic rationale is supported by findings in models of noise-induced hearing loss and autoimmune inner ear disease where similar inflammatory pathways are disrupted (Chang et al., 2020; Cavalli & Dinarello, 2018). Thus, in systems where Anakinra has been administered—whether intratympanically in animal models or subcutaneously in clinical settings—it is reasonable to expect that similar pathways may be modulated in the aged cochlea, reducing oxidative stress and stabilizing the activity of ion channels required for efficient mechanotransduction.

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, Anakinra represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss. Its strengths lie in its well-characterized mode of action as a specific IL-1 receptor antagonist, which has been shown to modulate inflammatory responses in a number of disease contexts. The robust clinical history of Anakinra in inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune inner ear pathologies, lends support to the notion that it could be effective in mitigating the inflammatory component of ARHL. The molecular rationale—that IL-1β contributes significantly to inflammasome activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and subsequent dysregulation of ion channels in cochlear hair cells—is biologically plausible and is supported by data from studies examining related hearing disorders (Dinarello, 2018; Guo et al., 2022). In addition, preclinical dosing information, including administration routes such as intratympanic application in ototoxicity models, underscores the technical feasibility of targeting the inner ear with Anakinra, potentially offering local control of inflammation while minimizing systemic side effects (Mukherjea et al., 2015; Lye et al., 2023).

However, several weaknesses and uncertainties remain. While there is supporting evidence that Anakinra can reduce inflammation and protect against hearing loss in models of autoimmune inner ear disease and noise-induced injury, the direct application of Anakinra to ARHL has not been fully established. The pathophysiology of ARHL is multifactorial; aside from inflammation, age-related hearing loss involves cumulative oxidative stress, genetic predispositions, and other degenerative changes that may not be entirely addressed through IL-1 blockade alone (Hu et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2024). Furthermore, while the inhibition of IL-1 signaling might reduce inflammasome activity and preserve mitochondrial function, direct evidence linking these molecular events to the maintenance of mechanotransduction in aged cochlear hair cells is currently lacking from both preclinical and clinical studies. Additional challenges include the need for accurately targeted drug delivery to the cochlea in aging patients and the potential for dosing regimens that differ from those established in younger, inflammatory conditions (Chang et al., 2020; Dinarello, 2018).

Moreover, while the concept of blocking IL-1 signaling to maintain the function of PMCA and SERCA pumps and thus preserve intracellular calcium homeostasis is theoretically attractive, the detailed quantitative impact on hair cell ion channel function, mitochondrial activity, and ultimately mechanotransduction is yet to be fully characterized. This gap highlights the necessity for further basic research and well-designed preclinical studies investigating the effects of Anakinra on aged cochlear hair cells specifically. In future studies, it would be critical to ascertain whether Anakinra can indeed prevent the subtle changes in ion channel regulation and mitochondrial dynamics that are observed during cochlear aging, and whether such interventions translate into measurable improvements in auditory function (Li et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2023).

On balance, Anakinra’s established safety profile and its mechanistic relevance in modulating IL-1-driven inflammatory responses make it an attractive candidate for further investigation in ARHL. Its repurposing for age-related cochlear disorders is scientifically justified by the increasing evidence that chronic inflammation and inflammasome activation are central to the progression of ARHL. Nonetheless, the proposal must contend with the inherent complexity of aging-related pathologies and the need for robust experimental validation that directly correlates IL-1 blockade with the preservation of cochlear hair cell mechanotransduction. Therefore, while Anakinra shows promise based on its known biology and previous clinical uses, the therapeutic candidate would benefit from additional targeted studies that bridge the gap between established outcomes in inflammatory inner ear diseases and the unique pathophysiological features associated with age-related cochlear degeneration (Kim et al., 2021; Lye et al., 2023).

Overall, our evaluation concludes that Anakinra is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of ARHL via its inhibition of IL-1 signaling. Its mechanism of action—blocking IL-1β/IL-1α interactions at the receptor level, thereby potentially preventing inflammasome activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ion channel dysregulation—presents a compelling rationale for repurposing this agent to preserve cochlear hair cell mechanotransduction in the aging inner ear. However, the translational potential of this approach is contingent upon further dedicated studies that specifically assess its impact on aged cochlear cells and evaluate long-term auditory outcomes in ARHL models. With these considerations in mind, the next logical step in our program would be to design rigorous preclinical studies that directly test the efficacy of Anakinra in preventing or reversing age-related degenerative changes in cochlear hair cells, ultimately leading to improved hearing function in aging populations (Qiu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2022).
