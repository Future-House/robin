Proposal for AICAR

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
AICAR (5‐aminoimidazole‐4‐carboxamide ribonucleotide) is an adenosine analog that was discovered in the early 1990s as a tool to probe cellular energy metabolism, and it has since been characterized as a cell‐permeable pharmacological activator of AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Višnjić et al., 2021). Chemically, AICAR is a ribonucleoside that, upon entering cells via adenosine transporters, is phosphorylated by adenosine kinase to yield ZMP (5‐aminoimidazole‐4‐carboxamide ribonucleotide, also known as AICA ribotide). ZMP mimics AMP in its structure and function; it binds to the γ‐subunit of AMPK, thereby causing allosteric activation, promoting phosphorylation at Thr172 (Green, 2013). This compound belongs to the class of nucleoside analogs and metabolic modulators which impact cellular energy homeostasis, and similar compounds in this line have been used in preclinical and clinical settings primarily for metabolic disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction. AICAR was originally synthesized and developed as a research tool, and over time its potential for therapeutic repurposing emerged as its profound impact on cellular energetics and mitochondrial quality control was elucidated (Višnjić et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, AICAR has been extensively studied in a variety of preclinical models focused on metabolic regulation and mitochondrial diseases. It has been used to probe the pathways involved in glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis in tissues such as skeletal muscle and the heart (Green, 2013). Clinical trials have investigated AICAR in conditions like type 2 diabetes, where its ability to acutely increase AMPK activity translates into improved glucose uptake and metabolic regulation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). For instance, an early clinical trial conducted by the Baker Heart Research Institute (Baker Heart Research Institute, 2002) evaluated AICAR’s impact on leg glucose uptake in diabetic patients, demonstrating that AICAR-induced AMPK activation leads to enhanced GLUT-4 translocation and improved metabolism in skeletal muscle (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, preclinical studies in models of mitochondrial myopathy demonstrated that sustained AICAR treatment improves mitochondrial function by increasing cytochrome c oxidase activity and even delaying disease onset through mechanisms that involve enhanced tissue regeneration (El-Hattab et al., 2017; Peralta et al., 2016). Although AICAR has not been directly used in clinical trials for Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL), its well-documented effects on AMPK activation and subsequent upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant responses are highly relevant to cochlear health. Studies in auditory research have noted that age-related declines in mitochondrial function and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) are hallmarks of cochlear degeneration (Ege et al., 2024), suggesting that a repurposed agent like AICAR might be effective in counteracting these cellular deficits.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, AICAR exerts its effects primarily by activating AMPK, the cell’s central metabolic sensor. Once phosphorylated intracellularly to ZMP, AICAR structurally mimics AMP and binds to the γ-subunit of AMPK, thereby relieving autoinhibition of the catalytic α-subunit and facilitating its phosphorylation at Thr172 by upstream kinases such as LKB1 (Višnjić et al., 2021; Green, 2013). This activation of AMPK triggers a cascade of downstream events. One of the most important downstream effects is the promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis through the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). PGC-1α is a master transcriptional coactivator that, when activated by AMPK, translocates to the nucleus and upregulates the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial replication and function (Cortada et al., 2021; Višnjić et al., 2021). Additionally, AMPK activation by AICAR leads to inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which simultaneously promotes autophagy and mitophagy. These processes are essential for the removal of damaged organelles, particularly mitochondria, thereby reducing oxidative stress and preserving cellular function (Green, 2013; Moore et al., 2020). In tissues with high metabolic demand such as cochlear hair cells, this regulation is essential to maintain ATP levels needed for Ca²⁺-dependent processes like the operation of plasma membrane Ca²⁺ pumps (PMCA) and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase (SERCA), which in turn modulate mechanotransduction channel gating (Ege et al., 2024).

Beyond its effect on AMPK, AICAR exhibits several AMPK-independent actions. At high intracellular concentrations, AICAR (or its metabolite ZMP) can interact with other AMP-sensitive enzymes. These interactions include modulation of nucleotide synthesis pathways, where interference with enzymes such as UMP synthase can affect pyrimidine synthesis and cell proliferation (Višnjić et al., 2021). These off-target effects, while sometimes contributing to its antitumor activities (as seen in various cancer models), are generally secondary to its metabolic actions in the context of energy homeostasis. The delicate balance between its AMPK-dependent and independent effects ultimately influences its overall therapeutic potential and limits, making dosing and route of administration critical considerations in any translation to new applications such as ARHL (Višnjić et al., 2021; Moore et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
For Age-Related Hearing Loss, the current hypothesis is that AICAR will restore the energy balance in cochlear hair cells by activating AMPK, leading to the following expected beneficial outcomes:
1. Enhanced Mitochondrial Biogenesis: Activation of AMPK by AICAR is anticipated to lead to increased phosphorylation and activation of PGC-1α, which in turn promotes mitochondrial replication and function. Given that studies in various models have shown upregulation of mitochondrial markers and improved oxidative capacity following AICAR treatment (Cortada et al., 2021; Peralta et al., 2016), similar results might be expected in aged cochlear explants where mitochondrial dysfunction is a common occurrence in ARHL. Increased mitochondrial biogenesis would boost ATP production necessary for maintaining proper ion gradients, ensuring that mechanotransduction channels operate efficiently (Cortada et al., 2021).

2. Reduction in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS): Mitochondrial dysfunction in aging cochlear cells leads to an accumulation of ROS, which damages cellular components and accelerates hair cell loss. By activating AMPK, AICAR is expected to reduce ROS levels indirectly through improved mitochondrial turnover and by upregulation of antioxidant defenses, as has been demonstrated in neuronal cultures using AICAR–a finding that is supportive of its potential in mitigating oxidative stress in the inner ear (Hu & Ma, 2021; Ege et al., 2024). Reduced oxidative stress would help in preserving the integrity and function of cochlear hair cells and supporting cells.

3. Preservation of ATP-Dependent Processes: The cochlear hair cell function depends crucially on the energy provided by mitochondria to support ATP-dependent processes such as Ca²⁺ pumping by PMCA and SERCA, which are essential for rapid adaptation of the mechanotransduction (MET) channels (Ege et al., 2024; Cortada et al., 2021). Since ARHL is characterized by a decline in ATP levels due to mitochondrial inefficiency, activation of AMPK by AICAR would help in restoring energy levels, thereby maintaining Ca²⁺ homeostasis and proper mechanotransduction kinetics. In vitro assays using aged cochlear explants have demonstrated deficits in mechanotransduction that correlate with reduced AMPK activity, and preliminary evidence suggests that AICAR at 500 μM can increase AMPK phosphorylation and upregulate PGC-1α, offering a mechanistic basis for these expected benefits (Ege et al., 2024; Cortada et al., 2021).

4. Support of Cellular Homeostasis and Cell Survival: By promoting both mitochondrial regeneration and autophagy, AICAR helps the cell eliminate damaged organelles, thereby reducing the triggers for apoptosis. In the context of cochlear aging, where cellular damage and apoptosis contribute to progressive hearing loss, AMPK activation can tilt the balance towards maintenance of cellular integrity and function (Hill, 2015; Hu & Ma, 2021). This dual effect not only improves the metabolic capacity but also contributes to the structural preservation of the efferent synaptic connections necessary for hearing.

Overall Evaluation:
AICAR presents as a promising repurposed candidate for ARHL for several reasons. First, its molecular mechanism is well understood: by activating AMPK, AICAR stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1α, improves cellular energy homeostasis, and induces protective autophagy pathways that are crucial for combating oxidative stress (Green, 2013; Višnjić et al., 2021). These mechanisms address the central pathophysiological features of ARHL, namely mitochondrial dysfunction, energy depletion, and oxidative cellular damage (Ege et al., 2024).

Strengths of AICAR include its water solubility and cell permeability, advantageous properties that support its use in ex vivo and in vivo models, as well as its already established safety profile in several clinical studies for metabolic diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Baker Heart Research Institute, 2002). The compound has been extensively studied in varied systems such as muscle, cardiac tissue, and neuronal cultures, thereby providing a robust background of data supporting its potential to restore energy balance in high metabolic demand cells like cochlear hair cells (El-Hattab et al., 2017; Peralta et al., 2016). Moreover, data from recent auditory research indicates that reduced AMPK activity correlates with functional deficits in mechanotransduction in aged cochlear explants (Ege et al., 2024), which supports the rationale for an AMPK activator to reverse such deficits.

However, several challenges and weaknesses must be considered. AICAR, though effective in preclinical models, has demonstrated complex pharmacodynamics due to its AMPK-independent effects at high intracellular concentrations, which may result in unintended metabolic disturbances (Višnjić et al., 2021; Moore et al., 2020). Optimization of dose, timing, and targeted delivery is critical to ensure that the beneficial effects on mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative stress reduction are not counterbalanced by off-target or pro-apoptotic actions. Furthermore, direct evidence of AICAR’s protective effects in cochlear hair cells remains limited in the literature; most studies have focused on its role in muscle, cardiac, and cancer cells (Hill, 2015; Hu & Ma, 2021). Therefore, dedicated preclinical studies using aged cochlear explants and in vivo animal models specific to ARHL will be necessary to validate its efficacy and to determine the optimal therapeutic window. Lastly, potential pharmacokinetic challenges related to achieving sufficient local concentrations in the inner ear, given the presence of the blood-labyrinth barrier, must be addressed to ensure effective drug delivery (Wu et al., 2023; Okur & Djalilian, 2022).

In summary, AICAR exhibits a robust mechanism of action as an AMPK activator that enhances mitochondrial function, reduces oxidative stress, and supports energy-dependent cellular processes in high-demand cells such as cochlear hair cells. The expected effects in restoring proper mechanotransduction and protecting against oxidative and metabolic stress make it a compelling candidate for ARHL treatment (Cortada et al., 2021; Ege et al., 2024). Its prior therapeutic history in metabolic and mitochondrial diseases provides a foundation for repurposing, although direct application in hearing loss must be further substantiated through focused experimental studies. Overall, while AICAR shows significant promise, its complex bioactivity mandates rigorous preclinical evaluation to optimize its pharmacodynamics and delivery specifically for age-related cochlear protection before advancing to clinical trials for ARHL (Green, 2013; Peralta et al., 2016).
