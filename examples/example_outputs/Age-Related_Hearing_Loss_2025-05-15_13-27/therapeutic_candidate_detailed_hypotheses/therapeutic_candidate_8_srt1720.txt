Proposal for SRT1720

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SRT1720 is a fully synthetic small molecule identified as a potent allosteric activator of SIRT1, a NAD⁺–dependent histone deacetylase that plays a pivotal role in multiple cellular processes including energy homeostasis, stress response, mitochondrial biogenesis, and longevity regulation (Koo, Richter, & Tan, 2024). Initially discovered through high-throughput screening campaigns and further optimized via medicinal chemistry, this compound was designed to mimic the beneficial effects observed in caloric restriction models, thereby offering promising improvements in metabolic function and cellular stress resilience (Koo et al., 2024). SRT1720 belongs to the class of SIRT1 activators, a group of therapeutic candidates that have been widely investigated for their capacity to enhance mitochondrial function by deacetylating and thereby activating downstream substrates such as PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as other targets that contribute to oxidative stress reduction and improved cellular apoptosis resistance (Koo et al., 2024). The compound’s molecular design allows it to bind to a unique allosteric site on SIRT1, distinct from the NAD⁺ binding pocket, enabling an increase in SIRT1 catalytic efficiency that results in the deacetylation of multiple critical downstream proteins without significant interference with other cellular kinases or unrelated pathways (Koo et al., 2024). Importantly, SRT1720 was originally developed with the goal of ameliorating age-related metabolic disorders, and its robust preclinical effects in extending lifespan and enhancing mitochondrial function have provided a strong rationale for its repurposing toward additional applications, including age-related hearing loss (ARHL) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of SRT1720 is marked by extensive preclinical evaluation in models of metabolic dysfunction and age-related decline, where chronic administration of the compound in rodent models has been shown to significantly improve mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress markers, and even extend lifespan by approximately 8.8% in mice maintained on regular diets (Koo et al., 2024). In addition to its metabolic benefits, SRT1720 has been studied in models of acute ototoxic insult; for instance, in vitro experiments using HEI-OC1 auditory cells exposed to the ototoxic chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin have demonstrated that treatment with SRT1720 results in increased expression of SIRT1 and a corresponding enhancement of autophagy, as evidenced by elevated LC3-II and reduced accumulation of p62 protein, markers that reflect improved cellular clearance and organelle turnover (Koo et al., 2024). These in vitro findings have been recapitulated in animal studies using zebrafish lateral line hair cell models, where SRT1720 treatment led to a statistically significant increase in hair cell survival following cisplatin exposure, indicating its potential protective effects within sensory systems (Koo et al., 2024). Furthermore, in murine models such as the C57BL/6 strain—a well-established model for studying sensorineural and age-related hearing loss—administration of SRT1720 prior to cisplatin challenge was associated with reductions in auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold elevations measured across several frequency ranges (4, 8, 16, and 32 kHz) and lower losses of cochlear hair cells, suggesting that the compound can mitigate acute ototoxic damage (Koo et al., 2024). Although most historical data with SRT1720 have focused on metabolic endpoints and acute ototoxic models, these studies collectively establish a mechanistic basis for repurposing the agent in ARHL, a condition that shares common pathological features such as mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and signal transduction deficits in cochlear hair cells (Pang et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of SRT1720 is firmly rooted in its ability to serve as an allosteric activator of SIRT1, which is a central regulator of cellular metabolic and stress response pathways (Koo et al., 2024). SIRT1 functions by deacetylating a diverse range of substrate proteins including transcriptional coactivators such as PGC-1α, members of the FOXO family, and the tumor suppressor p53, thereby modulating a broad spectrum of cellular processes including energy metabolism, apoptosis, and the oxidative stress response (Koo et al., 2024). Specifically, when SRT1720 binds to SIRT1, it enhances the deacetylase activity of SIRT1, leading to a more robust deacetylation of PGC-1α; the deacetylated form of PGC-1α is then activated and migrates into the nucleus where it promotes the transcription of genes required for mitochondrial biogenesis and function, including the upregulation of components of the electron transport chain (Zheng et al., 2024). This cascade not only results in an increased number of mitochondria but also improves the efficiency of mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, which is vital for sustaining the high energy demands of cochlear hair cells engaged in mechanotransduction (Koo et al., 2024).

Furthermore, activation of SIRT1 by SRT1720 has been shown to indirectly influence the autophagic machinery within cells. In HEI-OC1 auditory cells, SRT1720 treatment leads to an increase in the autophagy marker LC3-II while reducing the levels of p62, a protein that is degraded during autophagic flux; this reflects an enhanced clearance of damaged proteins and organelles, including dysfunctional mitochondria, resulting in improved cellular homeostasis (Koo et al., 2024). This autophagic response is particularly important in the context of aging, where the accumulation of damaged cellular components contributes to heightened oxidative stress and cellular senescence. By promoting autophagy, SRT1720 helps maintain the integrity of the mitochondrial population, thereby preserving the bioenergetic capacities of cells (Koo et al., 2024).

In addition to its effects on mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy, SRT1720 modulates the Nrf2 signaling pathway—a crucial regulator of the antioxidant response. Under conditions of oxidative stress, Nrf2 is typically sequestered in the cytoplasm and targeted for degradation; however, upon deacetylation by activated SIRT1, Nrf2 is stabilized and translocates into the nucleus where it binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoters of genes encoding key antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (Zheng et al., 2024). The upregulation of these antioxidant enzymes considerably reduces intracellular ROS levels, thereby preventing the oxidative modifications of critical cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and DNA (Zheng et al., 2024). This dual mechanism—heightening mitochondrial quality and amplifying antioxidant defenses—creates a cellular environment that is more resilient to the cumulative oxidative stress seen in aging cochlear cells (Zheng et al., 2024).

Beyond these core mechanisms, SRT1720 may also exert additional beneficial effects by modulating other factors involved in cellular survival. For instance, SIRT1 deacetylates and suppresses the activity of pro-apoptotic proteins such as p53, thereby reducing apoptosis in stressed cells (Liu et al., 2022). In the specialized context of cochlear hair cells, which rely heavily on consistent ATP production and a pristine oxidative environment to sustain mechanotransduction processes mediated by ion channels like TMC1/TMC2, these molecular effects can help maintain not only cell viability but also the fine structural and functional properties of the mechanotransduction complex (Koo et al., 2024). These detailed molecular interactions provide a compelling mechanistic framework for how SRT1720 could theoretically counteract the progressive decline in cochlear function observed with aging (Pang et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
Based on its well-defined mechanism of action, SRT1720 is expected to exert several beneficial effects in the context of age-related hearing loss (ARHL). At the cellular level, the activation of SIRT1 by SRT1720 should result in the robust deacetylation of PGC-1α, leading to the upregulation of genes critical for mitochondrial biogenesis and function (Zheng et al., 2024). This increase in mitochondrial number and function is anticipated to raise intracellular ATP levels, stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and support the energy-intensive process of mechanotransduction in cochlear hair cells, where ion channels such as TMC1 and TMC2 require a steady ATP supply to operate efficiently (Koo et al., 2024).

In addition, SRT1720 is expected to boost the antioxidant capacity of cochlear cells through the activation of the Nrf2 pathway. The subsequent upregulation of endogenous antioxidant enzymes like SOD, CAT, and GPX will diminish the accumulation of ROS, thereby reducing lipid peroxidation markers such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) (Zheng et al., 2024). This reduction in oxidative stress is particularly crucial for protecting the delicate stereocilia and other mechanotransduction structures, which are highly susceptible to ROS-mediated damage that can compromise the fidelity of auditory signal transduction (Zheng et al., 2024).

Furthermore, improvements in autophagy induced by SRT1720 are likely to promote the clearance of damaged proteins and dysfunctional mitochondria, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and reducing the pro-apoptotic burden in aged cochlear hair cells (Koo et al., 2024). This benefit is of utmost importance in aging tissues, where inefficient autophagic clearance can lead to the accumulation of cellular debris and further exacerbate oxidative damage, eventually culminating in cell death and loss of auditory function (Koo et al., 2024).

Functionally, these cellular effects should translate into measurable improvements in auditory physiology. Preclinical studies utilizing acute models of ototoxicity have demonstrated that SRT1720 treatment leads to lower auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold shifts and preservation of hair cell numbers (Koo et al., 2024). In the context of ARHL, where chronic oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction progressively undermine the structural and functional integrity of the cochlea, it is anticipated that SRT1720 will help sustain mechanotransduction by preserving hair cell survival and ensuring the optimal performance of ion channels involved in hearing (Pang et al., 2019). Moreover, the stabilization of plasma membrane Ca²⁺ ATPase (PMCA) activity due to maintained ATP levels and the protection of TMC channel gating mechanisms are expected to further support the fidelity of the mechano-electrical transduction (MET) current, which is fundamental to auditory signal conversion (Koo et al., 2024).

In vitro assays using HEI-OC1 auditory cell lines subjected to oxidative stress via agents such as hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) have shown that SRT1720 reduces mitochondrial ROS production, improves cell viability, and enhances markers of autophagic flux; these effects collectively are expected to counteract the damage induced by chronic ROS accumulation in aged cochlear hair cells (Koo et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024). Therefore, in an age-related experimental paradigm, one would predict that treatment with SRT1720 could lead to a sustained preservation of ABR parameters, improved synaptic integrity evident from the maintenance of ribbon synapses, and overall stabilization of cochlear bioenergetics, all contributing to the retention of auditory function (Zheng et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of SRT1720 as a therapeutic candidate for ARHL presents a multi-faceted picture, combining robust mechanistic insight and promising preclinical evidence with certain challenges that warrant further investigation. On the strength side, SRT1720’s well-characterized role as a SIRT1 activator provides a strong molecular rationale for its use in combating ARHL. Activation of SIRT1 is known to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis via deacetylation and activation of PGC-1α, a process that is critical for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis in high-demand cells such as cochlear hair cells (Koo et al., 2024). This is further corroborated by evidence showing that SRT1720 induces autophagy, thereby facilitating the removal of damaged organelles and protecting cells against cumulative oxidative stress (Koo et al., 2024). The compound’s ability to bolster the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway adds another layer of protection by upregulating detoxifying enzymes, reducing ROS, and preventing oxidative damage to cellular macromolecules and the mechanotransduction apparatus (Zheng et al., 2024).

Furthermore, preclinical studies using SRT1720 in acute ototoxic models have demonstrated significant protective effects on auditory function, including reduced ABR threshold shifts and preservation of hair cell populations, which is promising given the similarities between the molecular insults of acute ototoxicity and the cumulative oxidative damage seen in ARHL (Koo et al., 2024). Additionally, related compounds—such as resveratrol, another SIRT1 activator—have shown efficacy in models of auditory degeneration, thereby strengthening the rationale for employing SRT1720 in this context (Pang et al., 2019).

However, several weaknesses remain that must be addressed before SRT1720 can be considered a viable therapeutic option for ARHL. One key issue is that the majority of existing efficacy studies with SRT1720 have been conducted in models of acute ototoxicity (for example, cisplatin-induced damage) rather than in chronic, age-related models. ARHL is a complex, multifactorial disorder characterized by gradual and progressive changes in cochlear structure and function, and it remains to be demonstrated whether the beneficial mechanisms observed in acute models will translate effectively to these chronic conditions (Koo et al., 2024).

Another challenge is the pharmacokinetic profile of SRT1720, particularly regarding its delivery to the inner ear. The blood–labyrinth barrier poses a significant obstacle for systemic drug delivery, and although approaches like round-window injections have been explored in animal studies, these methods may not be directly applicable to human therapy without further optimization and safety validation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Some studies also raise questions about the specificity of SRT1720’s action on SIRT1, with suggestions that off-target effects or intermediary pathways might contribute to its overall efficacy; this mechanistic uncertainty necessitates additional research to confirm that the protective effects observed are indeed due to targeted SIRT1 activation (Koo et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2022).

Moreover, long-term safety data concerning chronic SIRT1 activation in cochlear tissues are limited. Although enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and increased autophagic flux are advantageous in the short term, sustained overactivation could potentially disrupt the delicate balance of cellular homeostasis or trigger compensatory mechanisms that might undermine therapeutic efficacy over time. As ARHL typically occurs over decades, thorough longitudinal studies in relevant animal models are required before proceeding to clinical trials (Koo et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024).

Despite these outstanding questions, the mechanistic and preclinical evidence reviewed here makes a compelling case for further investigation of SRT1720 in the context of ARHL. Its capacity to enhance mitochondrial quality control, reduce ROS-mediated damage, and ultimately preserve the structural and functional integrity of cochlear hair cells directly addresses the core pathophysiological processes underlying age-related auditory decline (Pang et al., 2019; Koo et al., 2024). The hypothesis that SRT1720 will maintain ATP production, support PMCA activity, and stabilize the gating behavior of key mechanotransduction channels such as TMC1/TMC2 is grounded in well-established biochemical principles and supported by the extensive literature on SIRT1-mediated benefits in high-energy-demand tissues (Koo et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024).

In summary, SRT1720 exhibits several strengths as a candidate for repurposing toward age-related hearing loss. These strengths include a well-defined mechanism of action involving SIRT1 activation that promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, enhances cellular antioxidant defenses via the Nrf2 pathway, and supports autophagy that together preserve cochlear hair cell function and integrity. The preclinical evidence in acute ototoxicity models—while not directly representative of chronic ARHL—provides encouraging proof-of-concept data that justify further exploration in age-related models. Challenges remain, particularly regarding optimal drug delivery to the inner ear, long-term safety, and definitive demonstration of efficacy in chronic aging models. Nonetheless, given the significant overlap in the pathological mechanisms of acute ototoxic damage and ARHL, continued investigation into SRT1720’s effects on the aging cochlea is well warranted (Koo et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Ege, Tao, & North, 2024).

Overall, the comprehensive literature review supports additional preclinical and eventually clinical investigations of SRT1720 as a therapeutic candidate for ARHL. Its targeted activation of SIRT1, leading to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved autophagic clearance, and robust antioxidant defense, addresses fundamental aspects of cochlear degeneration observed in aging. Future studies should concentrate on establishing its pharmacokinetics within the inner ear, refining dosing strategies to optimize tissue penetration while minimizing systemic toxicity, and performing long-term efficacy studies in animal models that accurately recapitulate the chronic progression of ARHL. If these investigations ultimately confirm the anticipated benefits of SRT1720, the compound could become a valuable intervention for preserving mechanotransduction capacities, thereby delaying or preventing the decline in auditory function that significantly impacts the quality of life in aging populations (Koo et al., 2024; Pang et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In conclusion, SRT1720 presents a scientifically sound and mechanistically promising approach for tackling age-related hearing loss. Its multifaceted actions—enhancing mitochondrial quality control via PGC-1α deacetylation, upregulating antioxidant enzymes through Nrf2 stabilization, and facilitating autophagic flux to remove damaged organelles—directly target the processes that underlie cochlear hair cell dysfunction in the aging ear. While additional preclinical research is essential to address unresolved issues about long-term safety, delivery routes, and specific efficacy in chronic hearing loss models, the existing body of evidence provides a robust foundation for the continued development of SRT1720 as a repurposed drug candidate in ARHL. With carefully designed studies and a strategic translational roadmap, SRT1720 could offer a novel, mechanism-based therapeutic option that significantly improves auditory health and quality of life for the aging population (Koo et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Ege, Tao, & North, 2024).
