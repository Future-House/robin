Proposal for Sildenafil

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of sildenafil as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for age‐related hearing loss.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sildenafil, widely known under its trade name Viagra®, is a synthetic small‐molecule drug that belongs to the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor class. Initially discovered and developed as an agent to treat erectile dysfunction, sildenafil was designed following early observations with the compound zaprinast, with subsequent chemical refinements yielding improved potency and selectivity toward the PDE5 isoenzyme. This class of compounds functions by competitively inhibiting PDE5, an enzyme normally responsible for hydrolyzing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) into 5′-GMP; inhibition of this enzyme results in sustained elevations in intracellular cGMP levels. Elevated cGMP, in turn, potently activates downstream targets such as cGMP‐dependent protein kinase (PKG), which mediates smooth muscle relaxation through the regulation of intracellular calcium and other effectors. Originally, the clinical success of PDE5 inhibitors in promoting vasodilation—by enhancing nitric oxide (NO)/soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC)/cGMP signaling—led to their approval for erectile dysfunction and later for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The underlying mechanisms of these drugs have been well documented in vascular smooth muscle tissues, and there is now emerging theoretical interest in applying these vasodilatory properties in the inner ear. In particular, the stria vascularis, a highly vascularized structure essential for maintaining the ionic composition of the endolymph and the endocochlear potential, expresses PDE5 and other components of the NO/cGMP pathway. This anatomical and molecular presence suggests that modulating cGMP levels may improve cochlear microvascular perfusion, and thereby enhance nutrient and antioxidant delivery to hair cells. Thus, despite its well‐established clinical uses in vascular disorders, there is a potentially new indication in age‐related cochlear ischemia and metabolic insufficiency leading to sensorineural hearing loss (ElHady et al., 2023; Manna et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
Sildenafil’s clinical journey began with its approval in the late 1990s for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, evolving rapidly into a therapeutic mainstay in vascular modulation. Over subsequent years, its use was extended to pulmonary arterial hypertension, where its ability to enhance NO-mediated vasodilation produced measurable improvements in pulmonary hemodynamics. In these domains, sildenafil’s mechanism—rooted in the modulation of cGMP—has been extensively validated in both clinical and biochemical studies, and its pharmacokinetic profile, dosing regimens, and safety data have been well characterized in multiple patient populations. Despite this broad therapeutic history in vascular and pulmonary contexts, the application of sildenafil for auditory indications remains in its early stages. A systematic search of clinical trial registries using the query “AREA[InterventionName]sildenafil AND (AREA[Condition]"hearing loss" OR AREA[Condition]"age-related hearing loss" OR AREA[Condition]presbycusis)” returned no results, highlighting that no controlled clinical evaluations have been undertaken for its use in hearing loss (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical data in the auditory domain have yielded mixed outcomes. For instance, animal models have reported both protective and damaging effects on hearing following PDE5 inhibition. One set of studies indicates that sildenafil can modulate distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds under acute noise challenge conditions, suggesting that enhanced cochlear perfusion might confer protection against noise-induced hearing damage (Aljeraisi, 2024). Conversely, other investigations report histopathological damage to the organ of Corti, including cellular disorganization and degenerative changes following high-dose or prolonged sildenafil administration (Zittoon, 2022; Manna et al., 2019). Collectively, while sildenafil has a long and successful history in addressing vascular dysfunction, its use in treating age‐related hearing loss remains controversial and largely unexplored outside of experimental models (Manna et al., 2019; Tanaka et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, sildenafil acts as a competitive inhibitor of PDE5, thereby preventing the breakdown of intracellular cGMP. Normally, nitric oxide (NO) released from endothelial cells activates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) to catalyze the conversion of GTP to cGMP. Elevated cGMP activates downstream signaling via protein kinase G (PKG), which phosphorylates target proteins and leads to a cascade of events culminating in smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. This well-established mechanism is the cornerstone of sildenafil’s therapeutic effects in erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension (ElHady et al., 2023). In the cochlear context, key components of this pathway, including NO, sGC, cGMP, and PKG, are expressed in vascular structures such as the stria vascularis as well as in cochlear hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons. These findings suggest a potential role for increased cGMP in augmenting cochlear blood flow and thereby supporting cellular function (Manna et al., 2019). The hypothesis for repurposing sildenafil for age-related hearing loss builds upon this mechanistic framework: by elevating intracochlear cGMP, sildenafil could facilitate enhanced vasodilation within the stria vascularis, which would be expected to improve perfusion, nutrient delivery, and antioxidant access to metabolically stressed hair cells. Such improved blood–labyrinth barrier function may in turn mitigate ischemia-driven dysfunction of mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channels—a critical process in auditory signal conversion (ElHady et al., 2023; Manna et al., 2019).

However, it is important to note that while the amplification of cGMP signaling can yield beneficial vascular effects, several preclinical studies have raised concerns about potential adverse consequences. Excessive accumulation of cGMP may trigger pro-apoptotic pathways involving caspase-3 and p38 MAP kinases, leading to cellular toxicity and structural damage within the organ of Corti (Zittoon, 2022; Manna et al., 2019). These findings underscore a delicate therapeutic balance in which the beneficial vasodilatory and antioxidant-delivery effects of sildenafil must be carefully weighed against risks of ototoxicity. The dualism of the NO/cGMP pathway in the cochlea is further complicated by the context-dependent response of inner ear cells—where increased NO can, in some circumstances, result in oxidative damage and apoptosis rather than cytoprotection (Wester et al., 2018). Hence, while the established molecular interactions offer a robust rationale for the drug’s proposed protective effects in age-related hearing loss, they also point to the need for defining a narrow and precise therapeutic window to avoid off-target cytotoxic effects.

Expected Effect:
The therapeutic hypothesis posits that sildenafil will elevate intracochlear cGMP levels, leading to a cascade of improvements in cochlear microcirculation. Under normal aging conditions, a decline in cochlear blood flow contributes to energy deficits in hair cells, impairing their ability to maintain the endocochlear potential and the function of mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channels. By inhibiting PDE5, sildenafil is expected to result in sustained vasodilation within the stria vascularis. This vasodilation would increase perfusion and, consequently, improve the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and crucially, endogenous antioxidants. Elevated antioxidant delivery is hypothesized to protect against mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress that are implicated in the deterioration of MET channel function observed in age-related hearing loss (Aljeraisi, 2024; Wester et al., 2018).

From a functional perspective, the expected outcomes in preclinical assays would include stabilization or improvement in distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), which serve as sensitive indicators of outer hair cell integrity, as well as reduced auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold shifts after a cochlear insult. For example, some animal studies have noted that acute administration of sildenafil at doses approximating 10 mg/kg shows a decrease in noise-induced ABR threshold shifts, suggesting that improved cochlear perfusion can mitigate transient auditory damage (Aljeraisi, 2024; Wester et al., 2018). Biochemical endpoints may include decreased markers of oxidative stress and improved mitochondrial integrity in cochlear hair cells. In addition, the presence of key components of the NO/cGMP pathway, such as PKG and cGMP-dependent effectors in the cochlea, supports the hypothesis that sildenafil’s action could lead to meaningful enhancements in local blood flow and cellular homeostasis (Manna et al., 2019).

Moreover, it is anticipated that by bolstering vascular function and antioxidant delivery, sildenafil might preserve the structure and function of the organ of Corti. Histopathologic assessments in animal models could demonstrate improved cellular architecture in the stria vascularis and hair cells compared to untreated or ototoxin-exposed controls, even in the face of age-related degenerative processes. In this context, protective endpoints would include not only electrophysiological measures such as DPOAE and ABR but also biochemical assays for antioxidant enzyme activity and immunohistochemical markers of cochlear cell survival. The overall expected therapeutic effect, therefore, is a multifaceted improvement in cochlear function that simultaneously addresses the vascular insufficiency and oxidative stress that underlie age-related auditory decline.

Overall Evaluation:
Sildenafil presents as a highly intriguing and promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of age-related hearing loss, yet its ultimate clinical utility remains uncertain due to a complex interplay of beneficial and potentially deleterious effects. On the one hand, its well-established mechanism as a PDE5 inhibitor provides a clear scientific rationale for improving cochlear microcirculation. The extensive clinical validation in erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension, coupled with preclinical data indicating that acute sildenafil administration can reduce noise-induced ABR threshold shifts, lend support to the notion that enhancing NO/cGMP signaling can positively affect cochlear function (ElHady et al., 2023; Aljeraisi, 2024). The expected benefits—improved blood flow in the stria vascularis, enhanced delivery of endogenous antioxidants, and preservation of mitochondrial and hair cell function—are all mechanistically plausible and address key aspects of the pathophysiology of age-related hearing loss.

On the other hand, the dualistic nature of sildenafil’s action raises significant concerns. Several preclinical studies have reported that excessive or prolonged elevation of cGMP may lead to ototoxic effects, including histopathological damage in cochlear structures such as the organ of Corti. Documented findings of cellular disorganization, vacuolation, and nuclear degeneration in animal studies imply that if dosing is not carefully controlled, sildenafil may induce adverse auditory outcomes rather than confer protection (Zittoon, 2022; Manna et al., 2019). Moreover, clinical case reports and retrospective pharmacovigilance incidents have noted sudden sensorineural hearing loss associated with PDE5 inhibitor use, highlighting that the therapeutic window might be narrow in the delicate environment of the inner ear (Manna et al., 2019; Tanaka et al., 2019).

An additional challenge is the absence of clinical trial data addressing the use of sildenafil in auditory disorders. The current literature, as reflected in systematic clinical trial searches, shows no active or completed studies evaluating sildenafil specifically for age-related hearing loss or presbycusis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Consequently, the translational potential of sildenafil for this indication remains unverified, and its benefits observed in preclinical models (e.g., reductions in ABR threshold shifts in acute models) may not directly correlate with improvements in the chronic and multifactorial pathology of presbycusis.

Furthermore, the heterogeneity inherent in age-related hearing loss complicates the repurposing strategy. Presbycusis results from a confluence of factors—including cumulative noise exposure, genetic predisposition, and vascular insufficiency—so that a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to be effective. Sildenafil might benefit a subset of patients in whom reduced cochlear perfusion is the primary driver of hair cell degeneration. However, without the identification of predictive biomarkers and targeted patient stratification, clinical trials may yield equivocal outcomes.

Lastly, it is critical to emphasize that determining an optimal dosing regimen is paramount. While acute dosing in animal models has demonstrated some protective effects, the chronic dosing required for managing a progressive condition like age-related hearing loss could raise safety issues. Long-term administration studies, with meticulous monitoring of both auditory function (using electrophysiological assays such as ABR and DPOAE) and cochlear histopathology, are essential to ascertain that sildenafil does not inadvertently provoke ototoxicity through off-target effects of excessive cGMP elevation (Wester et al., 2018; Manna et al., 2019).

Overall, sildenafil emerges as a candidate with a sound mechanistic rationale—leveraging its established NO/cGMP-mediated vasodilatory effects to possibly restore cochlear perfusion, reduce oxidative stress, and support hair cell function in the aging ear. Its strengths lie in the well-documented efficacy of PDE5 inhibition in vascular disorders, the presence of relevant molecular targets in the cochlea, and promising preclinical evidence suggesting that improved blood flow may protect against transient auditory insults (ElHady et al., 2023; Aljeraisi, 2024). At the same time, considerable weaknesses and gaps in our current knowledge persist. The risk of ototoxicity, as indicated by both animal studies and adverse event reports, raises a cautionary flag; the absence of dedicated clinical trials leaves the safety and efficacy profile in the auditory domain largely uncharted; and the complexity of presbycusis as a multifactorial disease means that efficacy may be limited to specific subgroups of patients.

Given these factors, the overall evaluation of sildenafil as a therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss is one of guarded optimism. On balance, while the theoretical framework is biologically plausible and supported by select preclinical findings, the potential for deleterious cochlear effects underscores the necessity for rigorous dose-finding, safety studies, and well-controlled preclinical models before advancing to human clinical trials. Future experimental designs should incorporate comprehensive electrophysiological assessments (including ABR and DPOAE measurements), detailed histological evaluations of cochlear structures, and biochemical assays for oxidative stress and mitochondrial function. Such studies will be critical to delineate the precise therapeutic window in which sildenafil’s vasodilatory and antioxidant-delivery benefits outweigh its ototoxic risks. Moreover, combination therapeutic strategies involving sildenafil along with agents that bolster antioxidant defenses or stabilize the blood-labyrinth barrier might help widen this window and offer superior protection against age-related auditory decline.

In conclusion, while sildenafil’s established role as a PDE5 inhibitor and its ability to enhance NO/cGMP signaling provide a strong scientific rationale for its potential utility in mitigating ischemia-driven hearing loss, its dualistic effects on the cochlea necessitate a cautious and methodical approach. The absence of clinical trial data in the auditory field further mandates that future research focus intensively on preclinical safety and efficacy endpoints. Only with such a rigorous and structured investigation can the true therapeutic potential of sildenafil for age-related hearing loss be determined, balancing its promise to rescue hair cell function via improved microvascular perfusion against the inherent risks of ototoxicity observed in some models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ElHady et al., 2023; Wester et al., 2018).
