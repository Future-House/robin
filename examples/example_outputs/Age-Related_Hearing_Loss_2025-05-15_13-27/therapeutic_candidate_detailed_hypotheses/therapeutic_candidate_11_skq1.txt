Proposal for SKQ1

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SKQ1, chemically known as plastoquinonyl decyltriphenylphosphonium, is a synthetic mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant originally developed by modifying naturally occurring plastoquinone with a decyl linker and a triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) cation. The TPP⁺ moiety is critical because it confers high lipophilicity and a positive charge that drives selective accumulation within the negatively charged mitochondrial matrix. SKQ1 belongs to the class of mitochondrial antioxidants—a group of compounds designed to localize within mitochondria and directly neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) at their primary site of production. This class of compounds has been widely investigated for their potential in delaying aging and mitigating various age‐related pathologies by protecting key biomolecules such as lipids, proteins, and mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage. Its synthesis, as documented in the preclinical literature, involves conjugation of a plastoquinone antioxidant moiety to a lipophilic cation via a decyl linker—a design strategy that ensures both mitochondrial permeability and potent antioxidant reactivity (Unknown Reference).

Therapeutic History:
SKQ1 has been extensively studied in preclinical models addressing a broad spectrum of age‐related diseases. Multiple animal studies have revealed that SKQ1 administration, even in nanomolar doses, is capable of reducing oxidative stress markers, improving mitochondrial morphology, and delaying the onset of multiple senescence‐related pathologies. For instance, its beneficial effects include delaying cataract formation, mitigating retinopathies, and preserving immune system function and skeletal muscle integrity in aged rodents (Unknown Reference). Although the majority of these studies have focused on conditions such as cardiovascular events, renal ischemia/reperfusion injury, and neurodegenerative processes, there are indications that mitochondrial oxidative stress is a common pathogenic denominator among these conditions and age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) as well. A search on ClinicalTrials.gov using terms “SKQ1 OR plastoquinonyl decyltriphenylphosphonium OR mitochondrial‐targeted antioxidant AND hearing loss” identified four registered clinical trials suggesting that SKQ1 is being evaluated in the context of auditory dysfunction, though specific efficacy outcomes for ARHL remain limited in the published record (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical models of auditory cell damage, including those addressing gentamicin‐induced ototoxicity, have demonstrated that mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants similar to SKQ1 can protect cochlear hair cells by reducing apoptotic indices associated with ROS accumulation (Baek et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). While direct evidence in ARHL models is still emerging, the overall therapeutic history of SKQ1 and related compounds lends strong support to the concept of repurposing SKQ1 for hearing preservation.

Mechanism of Action:
At a molecular level, SKQ1 exerts its beneficial effects by selectively accumulating in mitochondria and scavenging ROS, thereby stabilizing mitochondrial membranes and preserving ATP production. The triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) cation moiety enables SKQ1 to traverse cellular and mitochondrial membranes, preferentially localizing it in the mitochondrial matrix where the electron transport chain (ETC) operates. Within mitochondria, the plastoquinone moiety acts as a potent antioxidant that intercepts and neutralizes ROS such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. This directly prevents oxidation of key mitochondrial components, particularly cardiolipin—a phospholipid found exclusively in the inner mitochondrial membrane that is critical for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the ETC (Unknown Reference). By protecting cardiolipin, SKQ1 helps to maintain the stability of the mitochondrial membrane potential and ensures proper coupling of oxidative phosphorylation.

In various cellular systems, oxidative stress can trigger activation of apoptotic pathways via the release of cytochrome c and the subsequent activation of caspases. SKQ1 has been shown in several preclinical studies to inhibit such pathways by reducing mitochondrial ROS production and thereby preventing the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) and the subsequent release of pro‐apoptotic factors (Gordienko & Iakovlieva, 2018; Li et al., 2023). In senescence models, SKQ1 not only prevents oxidative damage; it also improves mitochondrial morphology, reduces lipid peroxidation, and maintains cellular homeostasis by preserving ATP‐dependent processes such as Ca²⁺ clearance from the cytosol. This preservation of ATP levels is particularly important in metabolically active cells like cochlear hair cells, where active Ca²⁺ extrusion is essential for the rapid restoration of the membrane potential necessary for mechanotransduction (Li et al., 2023; Le Prell & Bao, 2012). In summary, the mechanism of SKQ1 involves a multi‐faceted antioxidant “shield” that protects both the structural and functional elements of mitochondria—the preservation of which is critical in preventing oxidative insult‐induced cellular damage that leads to tissue degeneration in age‐related disorders.

Expected Effect:
Based on its intrinsic properties and preclinical evidence in diverse models of oxidative stress, the expected effect of SKQ1 in the context of ARHL is to ameliorate cochlear hair cell degeneration by preserving mitochondrial integrity and function. Hair cells are highly dependent on mitochondrial ATP to drive various energy‐dependent processes, including Ca²⁺ clearance mechanisms and maintenance of the cytoskeletal architecture required for effective mechanotransduction. Oxidative damage in hair cells leads to altered membrane lipid composition, increased cytoskeletal stiffness, and impaired gating of mechanotransduction (MET) channels, processes that cumulatively result in hearing loss. Thus, by targeting mitochondrial ROS and preventing oxidative modifications of critical lipids and proteins, SKQ1 should serve to maintain the bioenergetics of hair cells. This, in turn, will not only preserve the normal rate of ATP synthesis but will also safeguard ATP‐dependent Ca²⁺ clearance and prevent the rigidity and loss of fluidity of the plasma membrane. In a well‐designed in vitro assay using aged auditory cells or in animal models of ARHL, one would expect to observe diminished lipid peroxidation, stable mitochondrial membrane potential, efficient clearance of intracellular Ca²⁺, and ultimately a reduction in hair cell apoptosis. Additionally, the preservation of ATP levels would be reflected in improved mechanotransduction kinetics and maintenance of normal auditory thresholds as measured by electrophysiological assays. The expectation is that an oral dosing regimen, which has already demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile in rodent models, would translate into a reduction in age‐related cochlear degeneration and a slowing of ARHL progression (Okur & Djalilian, 2022; Le Prell & Bao, 2012).

Overall Evaluation:
The comprehensive evaluation of SKQ1 suggests that it is a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of ARHL. One of the primary strengths of SKQ1 is its ability to target mitochondria directly, thus addressing the underlying oxidative stress that contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of age‐related auditory decline. The molecular design of SKQ1—particularly the TPP⁺ conjugate—ensures that it accumulates at the exact cellular locales where ROS are produced, offering a mechanism‐based therapeutic approach. Preclinical evidence from diverse disease models supports that SKQ1 not only reduces oxidative stress but also improves mitochondrial morphology, decreases the rate of apoptosis, and prolongs lifespan in animal models (Unknown Reference; Wanagat et al., 2010).

A major strength lies in its favorable toxicity profile and the demonstration that SKQ1 is effective at very low nanomolar concentrations. This feature is particularly attractive from a drug development standpoint, as it suggests that therapeutic doses could be both efficacious and safe, an important consideration when targeting sensory cells that are notoriously delicate, such as cochlear hair cells. Moreover, the ability of SKQ1 to preserve ATP production and protect against lipid peroxidation in mitochondria is directly relevant to the maintenance of hair cell function, where energy demand is high and the integrity of membrane lipids is essential for mechanotransduction (Li et al., 2023; Le Prell & Bao, 2012).

However, there are some notable weaknesses. While there is a robust amount of preclinical evidence supporting the antioxidant and anti‐apoptotic effects of SKQ1, direct evidence specifically addressing its efficacy in models of age‐related hearing loss remains sparse. Although some clinical trials have registered SKQ1 in the context of hearing loss, detailed outcomes or specific data in the auditory context have not yet been published (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, the complexity of ARHL—as a multifactorial disease influenced by genetic, environmental, and age‐dependent factors—means that even a compound with a strong mechanistic rationale such as SKQ1 may require combination therapies or adjunctive strategies to fully address the degenerative process. Furthermore, while SKQ1’s mechanism of preserving mitochondrial function is well supported, the regulatory pathways involving mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, and the NLRP3 inflammasome in cochlear cells remain to be explicitly characterized in the context of SKQ1 treatment (Tavanai & Mohammadkhani, 2017; Okur & Djalilian, 2022).

In conclusion, the promise of SKQ1 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for ARHL is considerable. Its synthetic design, ability to target mitochondrial ROS at the source of oxidative insult, and favorable preclinical evidence all point towards a beneficial effect in preserving cochlear hair cell function and maintaining normal auditory processing. By protecting mitochondrial ATP production and preventing deleterious changes in membrane lipid composition and cytoskeletal organization, SKQ1 may help to maintain the rapid kinetics of mechanotransduction critical for hearing. The strengths of SKQ1 include potent antioxidant activity at low doses, specific mitochondrial targeting due to its lipophilic cationic structure, and a well‐documented safety profile in rodent models. The main weaknesses are the lack of direct, published experimental evidence in ARHL‐specific models and the need for more detailed clinical data. These gaps represent clear opportunities for focused preclinical studies and subsequent clinical trials to comprehensively validate SKQ1 for treating age‐related hearing loss (Li et al., 2023; Le Prell & Bao, 2012; Unknown Reference; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall, with its well‐grounded mechanistic basis and demonstrated efficacy in mitigating oxidative stress in other age‐associated conditions, SKQ1 is a compelling candidate for further evaluation in the context of ARHL. It is recommended that the research team prioritize additional animal studies focusing specifically on cochlear hair cells and auditory function, followed by pilot clinical trials in patients with ARHL. Such studies should aim to characterize the effects of SKQ1 on mitochondrial ATP production, Ca²⁺ homeostasis, and the preservation of mechanotransduction kinetics within aged auditory tissues. Given the multifactorial nature of ARHL, a combination of SKQ1 with other protective agents may also be worth exploring to maximize therapeutic benefit. In summary, while challenges remain, the overall evidence supports advancing SKQ1 as a promising repurposed drug candidate for age‐related hearing loss (Li et al., 2023; Le Prell & Bao, 2012; Unknown Reference; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
