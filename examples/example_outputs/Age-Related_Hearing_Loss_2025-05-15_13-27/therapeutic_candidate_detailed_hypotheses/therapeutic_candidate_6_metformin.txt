Proposal for Metformin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Metformin (Sigma #D150959) is a small‐molecule biguanide originally derived from the French lilac (Galega officinalis), which has been chemically optimized to yield a highly soluble, orally bioavailable formulation approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This compound belongs to the biguanide class and is well known for its antihyperglycemic properties that improve insulin sensitivity and lower hepatic glucose production. Metformin’s synthesis and subsequent formulation have undergone decades of refinement, ensuring an excellent safety profile in humans, as evidenced by its widespread clinical use. In recent years, the paradigm of repurposing metformin has extended into aging research due to its systemic metabolic effects and its ability to modulate key cellular pathways implicated in aging, including the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Large-scale epidemiological analyses and preclinical studies have demonstrated that metformin may yield beneficial effects in age-related pathologies beyond diabetes, such as neurodegeneration and cardiovascular disease, providing a compelling rationale for its evaluation in Age-Related Hearing Loss (Cheng et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Originally approved for type 2 diabetes, metformin has been utilized for several decades in clinical practice, with extensive post-marketing surveillance establishing its safety and tolerability. In biochemical and clinical studies, metformin’s anti-aging effects have been attributed to its capacity to activate AMPK, reduce oxidative stress, and modulate inflammatory pathways, with several preclinical models showing improvements in mitochondrial function and lifespan extension in model organisms. Although its traditional use is for glycemic control, recent animal studies have investigated its potential protective effects on sensory systems; for instance, experiments using rodent models of noise-induced hearing loss have demonstrated that metformin can reduce auditory threshold shifts and outer hair cell degeneration (Kennedy et al., 2023). Furthermore, studies such as those by Cai et al. have shown that metformin attenuates D-galactose-induced aging processes—including oxidative stress and neurodegeneration—in the auditory system, thereby providing indirect evidence for potential utility in ARHL (Cai et al., 2020). However, while noise-induced hearing loss models are not a direct substitute for ARHL, the underlying mechanisms involving mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage, and cellular apoptosis are shared between these conditions. This convergence has spurred interest in exploring metformin as a candidate to mitigate progressive hearing loss in aging populations, although direct clinical trials specific to ARHL are yet to be conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
Metformin exerts its primary biochemical effects through activation of the cellular energy sensor AMPK. Inhibition of mitochondrial complex I by metformin leads to an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio which in turn triggers LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of the AMPK α-subunit at threonine 172, culminating in robust AMPK activation. Activated AMPK then orchestrates a suite of downstream effects, including upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α), which is central to mitochondrial biogenesis. This pathway is particularly significant in post-mitotic cells with high energetic demands such as cochlear hair cells, where maintaining mitochondrial function is critical for normal mechanotransduction. In addition to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, AMPK activation by metformin leads to upregulation of antioxidant defense systems, reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and inhibition of pro-apoptotic pathways, thereby conserving cellular integrity under stress conditions (Ege et al., 2024).

At the molecular level, metformin’s actions extend to indirectly preserving the function of ATP-dependent ion pumps such as the plasma membrane Ca²⁺-ATPase isoform 2 (PMCA2), which is critically involved in calcium clearance and homeostasis in cochlear hair cells. As mitochondrial dysfunction in aging hair cells leads to ATP depletion, decreased PMCA2 activity may result in disturbed intracellular Ca²⁺ regulation, culminating in impaired mechanotransduction currents. By enhancing mitochondrial respiration and sustaining ATP production through AMPK-mediated pathways, metformin is hypothesized to preserve PMCA2 function and overall calcium homeostasis in the aging cochlea (Ege et al., 2024). Moreover, modulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) via AMPK/ERK1/2 signaling, as observed in some preclinical studies, may further support neuronal and cochlear cell survival (Cai et al., 2020). Metformin’s pleiotropic actions—spanning autophagy induction, reduction in cellular senescence, and anti-inflammatory signaling via NF-κB inhibition—paint a comprehensive picture of its molecular interactions that may collectively mitigate attributes of ARHL (Cheng et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
In the context of ARHL, the expected pharmacodynamic effect of metformin is multifaceted. By activating AMPK in cochlear hair cells, metformin is anticipated to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby increasing the number and function of mitochondria required for sustaining high metabolic demand and ATP-dependent processes. Enhanced mitochondrial function directly translates into reduced oxidative stress as mitochondria become more efficient in electron transport and ATP production, minimizing leakage of electrons that typically generate ROS. This reduction in oxidative stress is expected to curtail cumulative oxidative damage—a major contributor to ARHL—thereby preserving cell structure and function (Ege et al., 2024).

Moreover, metformin is hypothesized to preserve PMCA2 function by maintaining intracellular ATP levels necessary for the operation of this critical calcium pump. The preservation of PMCA2 is vital for proper calcium extrusion from hair cells, ensuring that the Ca²⁺ concentrations remain within physiologically tolerable limits to support sustained mechanotransduction. Given that dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and consequent alterations in resting intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations are implicated in the pathogenesis of ARHL, maintaining PMCA2 efficacy would be directly correlated with improved auditory function (Ege et al., 2024). Experimental studies in aged rodent models, where metformin was administered at doses approximating 200 mg/kg/day, have demonstrated upregulation of PGC-1α and improvements in mitochondrial integrity, thus lending support to the biochemical rationale behind its application for ARHL (Cai et al., 2020).

In addition, the expected anti-inflammatory properties of metformin, through reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, may contribute to a neuroprotective environment in the cochlea. Chronic inflammation is a well-documented factor in aging tissues and can exacerbate oxidative damage and apoptosis in sensory cells. Attenuation of inflammatory signaling would therefore be expected to further reduce the progression of hair cell degeneration, maintain cochlear synapse integrity, and ultimately preserve hearing function (Ege et al., 2024; Kennedy et al., 2023).

Overall, the cellular assay is predicted to reveal that metformin treatment in aged cochlear cells results in increased AMPK phosphorylation, higher expression of mitochondrial biogenesis markers such as PGC-1α, and decreased accumulation of ROS. Concomitantly, preservation of PMCA2 function should manifest as improved Ca²⁺ clearance dynamics, enhanced cellular viability, and sustained mechanotransduction currents, all of which are critical parameters in the maintenance of cochlear function (Ege et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Metformin presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for ARHL owing to its well-established safety profile, extensive clinical history in diabetes, and emerging evidence supporting its anti-aging and neuroprotective effects. The strengths of metformin for ARHL lie in its multifactorial mechanism of action, which encompasses AMPK activation, mitochondrial biogenesis, antioxidant defense enhancement, and potential preservation of essential ion pump functions such as that of PMCA2. Preclinical data from noise-induced hearing loss models, as well as studies on D-galactose-induced aging models, provide biochemical and cellular evidence that activation of AMPK leads to improved mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress—key factors implicated in the pathogenesis of ARHL (Cai et al., 2020; Ege et al., 2024).

In addition, metformin’s anti-inflammatory properties add another layer of benefit, given that chronic low-grade inflammation is a hallmark of aging and contributes to cellular degeneration in the auditory system. The compound’s capacity to modulate multiple aging pathways—ranging from inhibition of mTOR and insulin/IGF-1 signaling to upregulation of autophagy and downregulation of pro-apoptotic signals—supports a comprehensive therapeutic profile that theoretically targets several pathological processes underlying ARHL (Cheng et al., 2022).

However, there are also notable weaknesses and uncertainties associated with metformin’s repurposing for ARHL. First, despite robust biochemical rationale, direct clinical evidence demonstrating metformin’s protective effects specifically on age-related cochlear degeneration remains limited. Most of the supportive data come from animal models of noise-induced hearing loss or general neurodegeneration, which may not completely recapitulate the multifactorial etiology of ARHL. Moreover, while studies have indicated that metformin improves mitochondrial markers and reduces oxidative stress in neural tissues, evidence directly showing preservation of PMCA2 activity or maintenance of mechanotransduction currents in cochlear hair cells is still largely inferential (Cai et al., 2020; Ege et al., 2024; Kennedy et al., 2023).

Another potential limitation is the observed sex-specific efficacy in preclinical studies. Data from noise-induced hearing loss models have shown that metformin’s otoprotective effects appear robust in male mice but less so or absent in females, suggesting that hormonal differences may modulate drug action. This sex difference could complicate translation into clinical settings and necessitates further investigation into optimizing dosing regimens and understanding underlying mechanisms contributing to this variability (Kennedy et al., 2023).

Furthermore, while the hypothesis that improved mitochondrial biogenesis and reduced oxidative stress will maintain PMCA2 function is compelling, direct studies measuring PMCA2 levels or activity in metformin-treated cochlear hair cells are sparse. Future work should aim to incorporate precise biochemical assays to assess PMCA2 function and correlate these findings with mechanotransduction efficacy, ideally in both in vitro hair cell models and in vivo aged animal models (Ege et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2022).

In conclusion, metformin exhibits considerable promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss through its multifaceted actions on AMPK activation, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress reduction. Its long history of clinical use and safety in diabetic patients provide further translational appeal. Nevertheless, additional targeted studies—both at the molecular level in cochlear hair cells and in clinically relevant animal models of ARHL—are warranted to validate the mechanistic hypothesis, particularly regarding the preservation of PMCA2-mediated calcium clearance and the maintenance of mechanotransduction currents. Overall, while the preclinical data are encouraging, addressing the challenges and gaps identified will be crucial to determine whether metformin can be successfully repositioned as a therapeutic intervention for ARHL (Cai et al., 2020; Ege et al., 2024; Kennedy et al., 2023).
