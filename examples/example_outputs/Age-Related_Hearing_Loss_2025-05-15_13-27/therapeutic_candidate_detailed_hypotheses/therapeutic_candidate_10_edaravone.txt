Proposal for Edaravone

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Edaravone (Radicut®), developed and marketed by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, is a synthetic free radical scavenger initially discovered and optimized for its neuroprotective properties in the context of acute ischemic stroke. It belongs to the class of radical scavengers—small-molecule antioxidants—that have been widely used in several clinical settings to ameliorate oxidative damage in neurons. Edaravone’s chemical structure enables it to quench reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals, thereby reducing lipid peroxidation and protecting cell membranes from oxidative injury. The synthesis of edaravone was achieved by optimizing the characteristics of α-keto amide derivatives to achieve high solubility and potent free radical scavenging activity under both normoxic and ischemic conditions. As a member of this class, it has been used primarily in Japan and subsequently worldwide in stroke therapy, and more recently, its utility has been examined in conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The candidate’s applicability to Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) is hypothesized based on the shared pathogenic mechanism of oxidative stress in both brain ischemia and cochlear degeneration (Lin et al., 2011; Lynch & Kil, 2005).

Therapeutic History:
Edaravone has an established history as an intravenously administered therapeutic agent for acute ischemic stroke, where a dose of approximately 3 mg/kg is employed to neutralize injurious ROS generated during the ischemic cascade. In clinical settings, its use has been associated with a reduction in oxidative stress biomarkers and improved neurological outcomes in stroke patients. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that in models of ototoxicity—specifically gentamicin-induced hearing loss in guinea pigs—edaravone administration can preserve auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds and improve overall hair cell viability. However, comprehensive searches of the ClinicalTrials.gov database specifically using queries such as “Clinical Trial Search: Edaravone AND (hearing loss OR cochlea OR otoprotection OR age-related hearing loss OR auditory)” have yielded no registered clinical trials directly investigating edaravone for hearing loss, highlighting a significant translational gap. Moreover, extensive reviews and evidence tables compiled in the literature up to 2017, for example in the work by Hammill (2017), have not documented edaravone as a tested agent for ARHL in humans; it has appeared only in preclinical models (e.g., guinea pig studies showing prophylaxis/rescue effects) and as an item in comparative tables alongside other antioxidants. Similarly, in reviews focusing on cisplatin-induced hearing loss, edaravone has not been subjected to large-scale clinical evaluation, although it has been mentioned as an experimental compound with potential antioxidant properties in auditory contexts. This pattern underscores the fact that while edaravone’s therapeutic history is robust in stroke and limited ototoxicity models, its application to ARHL remains theoretical and primarily supported by preclinical and biochemical evidence (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hammill, 2017; Kishimoto-Urata et al., 2022; Lynch & Kil, 2005).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, edaravone functions by directly scavenging ROS such as hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and peroxyl radicals, which are central mediators of oxidative damage. The mechanism involves the donation of an electron or hydrogen atom from edaravone to the free radicals, thereby neutralizing them and averting the propagation of lipid peroxidation in cellular membranes. In the context of cochlear hair cells, oxidative stress is known to induce cytoskeletal remodeling and lipid raft disruption—both critical for the integrity of the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channels. MET channels, which are responsible for converting mechanical vibrations from sound into electrical signals, rely on intact lipid components and an organized actin cytoskeleton. Damage to these structural components by ROS leads to impaired channel gating and diminished hearing sensitivity. Edaravone, by reducing the levels of ROS, is hypothesized to prevent such lipid peroxidation and preserve the cytoskeletal architecture; for example, experimental data from ex vivo cochlear explants treated with concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 μM of edaravone have shown reduced intracellular ROS accumulation and improved hair cell viability under oxidative insults. On a broader biochemical scale, edaravone’s antioxidant activity may also involve the modulation of intracellular signaling pathways activated by oxidative stress, such as the NF-κB pathway, which regulates inflammatory responses and apoptosis in cochlear cells. Additionally, by preserving mitochondrial function—which is often compromised under conditions of oxidative stress—edaravone could maintain ATP production and the energy supply necessary for the operation of the MET apparatus in hair cells. Although the exact molecular interactions between edaravone and the specific molecular components of the MET channel complex have not been fully elucidated in the literature, its capacity to protect lipid-rich environments and prevent actin remodeling supports the notion that it can stabilize the complex’s architecture and function (Hammill, 2017; Kishimoto-Urata et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2011; Lynch & Kil, 2005).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothecated mechanism, the proposed effect of edaravone in the context of ARHL would be multifaceted. First and foremost, by scavenging excessive ROS in aging cochlear hair cells, edaravone could reduce the cumulative oxidative damage that leads to lipid peroxidation, a process critical in the degradation of cell membrane integrity. This action is particularly relevant given that oxidative stress is a well-documented driver in both noise-induced and age-related hair cell damage. Secondly, by preventing the peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipids in the plasma membrane, edaravone would help maintain the delicate balance of the lipid raft domains in which MET channels reside. Preservation of lipid raft architecture is essential to sustain the optimal gating of these channels, thereby contributing to the proper transduction of mechanical signals into neural impulses. Thirdly, edaravone’s radical-scavenging activity is expected to protect the actin cytoskeleton within hair cells—specifically, the actin core of stereocilia, which is essential for structural support and signal transduction. Ex vivo experiments with cochlear explants have indicated that treatment with edaravone reduces oxidative markers and preserves hair cell viability, confirming its direct impact on the cellular components underlying auditory function. In in vivo animal models, particularly in studies examining drug-induced ototoxicity using aminoglycosides such as gentamicin, edaravone has demonstrated promising otoprotective effects by reducing threshold shifts in auditory brainstem responses. While these effects have been documented in animal models, the extrapolation to ARHL—where chronic, cumulative oxidative stress leads to progressive hair cell loss—suggests that edaravone could mitigate the deterioration of cochlear structures over time, thereby preserving hearing function. The expected outcome in an assay system evaluating ARHL would therefore include reduced ROS levels in aging hair cells, maintenance of membrane lipid integrity and actin cytoskeleton organization, stabilization of MET channel function, and overall improved auditory thresholds in functional tests. Given that key proteins involved in hair cell signaling and integrity, such as those forming the MET complex, are known to be expressed in cochlear hair cells, edaravone’s antioxidant action is theoretically positioned to counteract the molecular cascade leading to ARHL (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hammill, 2017; Kishimoto-Urata et al., 2022; Lynch & Kil, 2005).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, the candidate edaravone presents a biologically plausible and promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss based on its well-characterized antioxidant properties. One of the major strengths of edaravone is its robust free radical scavenging capability, which has been extensively documented in the context of acute ischemic stroke and ALS. This property directly addresses a key pathological mechanism implicated in ARHL—namely, the excessive production of ROS that leads to lipid peroxidation, cytoskeletal disorganization, and subsequent hair cell dysfunction. The preclinical evidence from cochlear explant studies and animal models demonstrating reduced ROS levels and preserved hair cell integrity following edaravone treatment supports its potential efficacy (Kishimoto-Urata et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2011; Lynch & Kil, 2005).

Another strength lies in the mechanistic rationale for preserving mechanotransduction. Since MET channels are highly sensitive to the biochemical milieu of the cell membrane, preventing oxidative modifications of lipids and the actin cytoskeleton is crucial for maintaining these channels’ function. By protecting lipid rafts and cytoskeletal structures, edaravone is expected to sustain the conversion of mechanical sound stimuli into electrical signals, which is critical for hearing. This aspect is particularly innovative in the context of ARHL, where progressive loss of cellular integrity leads to diminished hearing sensitivity (Hammill, 2017; Kishimoto-Urata et al., 2022).

However, there are weaknesses and uncertainties that need to be considered. Despite promising preclinical data, there is a clear lack of clinical trials exploring edaravone’s use in hearing loss or ARHL specifically, as evidenced by multiple database searches that returned negative results for edaravone in this context. This absence of clinical evidence creates a translational gap that must be bridged by carefully designed phase I/II clinical studies. Furthermore, while edaravone’s dosing regimen (typically 3 mg/kg intravenously in stroke) is well established in neurologic indications, the optimal dosing, delivery mechanism, and pharmacokinetic profile for targeting cochlear tissues remain undefined. The inner ear’s unique anatomical barriers, such as the blood–labyrinth barrier, may require innovative drug delivery systems such as nanoparticle formulations or local (intratympanic) administration, as suggested by some preclinical studies that incorporate novel delivery vehicles for otoprotective agents (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hammill, 2017; Kishimoto-Urata et al., 2022; Lynch & Kil, 2005). Additionally, while the theoretical benefits on MET channel preservation are compelling, detailed molecular studies specifically demonstrating edaravone’s impact on the actin core of stereocilia and lipid raft integrity in cochlear hair cells are still limited. These gaps in the data highlight the need for more targeted mechanistic studies to confirm that edaravone’s antioxidant actions translate into clinically meaningful preservation of hearing function in the context of ARHL.

In summary, edaravone’s strong antioxidant profile, combined with preclinical evidence supporting its protective effects in ototoxicity models, underpins a compelling mechanistic rationale for its repurposing in ARHL. Strengths of this therapeutic candidate include its established clinical use in other oxidative stress-related conditions, its molecular ability to neutralize ROS, and its potential to physically stabilize the structures critical to mechanotransduction in cochlear hair cells. Weaknesses, however, relate largely to the paucity of direct clinical evidence in hearing loss, uncertainties regarding optimal delivery to the inner ear, and the need for further studies to elucidate its precise molecular interactions within cochlear tissues. Overall, while edaravone is a promising candidate supported by substantial biochemical and preclinical rationales (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hammill, 2017; Kishimoto-Urata et al., 2022; Lynch & Kil, 2005), advancing this candidate for ARHL will require a dedicated research program involving both enhanced preclinical mechanistic studies in relevant animal models and early-phase clinical trials to establish its safety, optimal dosing, and functional efficacy in preserving cochlear structure and hearing function.
