Proposal for Nicotinamide Riboside

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a naturally occurring derivative of vitamin B3 that was initially discovered during studies of NAD⁺ metabolism and nicotinamide salvage pathways. Found in trace amounts in naturally occurring sources such as milk, yeast, and certain vegetables, NR has been isolated and subsequently synthesized using biochemical extraction techniques and chemo‐enzymatic methods that yield high‐purity products suitable for both preclinical studies and clinical use (Alegre & Pastore, 2023). As a member of the nutraceutical and dietary supplement class of compounds, NR is specifically designed to boost intracellular levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺)—a critical coenzyme involved in cellular energy metabolism, glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as in maintaining redox homeostasis (Alegre & Pastore, 2023). Unlike other NAD⁺ precursors that rely on the Preiss–Handler pathway, NR is metabolized primarily via a dedicated pathway involving nicotinamide riboside kinases (NRK1 and NRK2), which convert it into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and subsequently into NAD⁺ (Alegre & Pastore, 2023). This unique metabolic route has increased interest in NR as a repurposed drug candidate, especially because it exhibits a high degree of oral bioavailability in both animal models and humans, making it an attractive candidate for chronic administration in conditions associated with NAD⁺ decline, such as Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) (Alegre & Pastore, 2023; Sharma et al., 2022). In the current context of drug development for ARHL, NR is being explored as a means to replenish NAD⁺ pools in cochlear hair cells, thereby mitigating age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage that are thought to contribute to auditory decline.

Therapeutic History:
Over the past decade, extensive biochemical, preclinical, and emerging clinical investigations have focused on the therapeutic potential of NR across a range of conditions in which NAD⁺ depletion plays a central role. Preclinical studies in animal models have demonstrated that NR supplementation can counteract high-fat diet-induced obesity, improve glucose homeostasis, enhance lipid metabolism, and stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis; these outcomes are particularly important in the context of aging, where decreased mitochondrial function and reduced NAD⁺ levels contribute to metabolic decline (Sharma et al., 2022; Biswas & Biotechnology Kiosk, 2020). In rodent models, increased NAD⁺ availability through NR supplementation has been linked to improvements in muscle function and overall energy metabolism, thereby extending lifespan and enhancing healthspan. Clinical studies in healthy human subjects have further established that NR is well tolerated, with doses up to 1 gram per day leading to significant increases in blood NAD⁺ levels and favorable changes in transcriptomic profiles that suggest reduced systemic inflammation (Airhart et al., 2017; Nakagawa-Nagahama et al., 2023). Although most clinical trials with NR have focused on metabolic and neurodegenerative endpoints, preclinical studies specifically examining ARHL have shown promising evidence. In aged murine models, NR supplementation has been observed to elevate cochlear NAD⁺ levels, improve auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds, and reduce synaptic degeneration in cochlear hair cells (Okur et al., 2023; Ege et al., 2024). Despite the absence of dedicated human trials in ARHL (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), the robust body of preclinical data in related neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders provides a solid scientific basis for pursuing NR as a treatment for age-related auditory decline.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, nicotinamide riboside serves as a direct precursor for the biosynthesis of NAD⁺. Once administered orally, NR is absorbed by target cells and phosphorylated by nicotinamide riboside kinases NKR1 and NKR2, yielding nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NMN is then enzymatically converted into NAD⁺ via nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) (Alegre & Pastore, 2023). This surge in intracellular NAD⁺ concentrations plays a pivotal role in activating NAD⁺-dependent enzymes, particularly the sirtuin family of deacetylases, with SIRT1 and SIRT3 being of major interest in the context of aging and mitochondrial quality control (Lloret & Beal, 2019).

SIRT1, which primarily resides in the nucleus, deacetylates target proteins such as PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. The deacetylation process enhances PGC-1α activity, leading to the transcription of genes that drive mitochondrial replication, repair, and efficient energy production. Meanwhile, SIRT3, localized to the mitochondria itself, deacetylates key metabolic enzymes that are central to preserving mitochondrial membrane potential and reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Ege et al., 2024; Lloret & Beal, 2019). Given that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are critical contributors to hair cell degeneration in ARHL, the activation of these sirtuin pathways by NR is expected to restore mitochondrial integrity, improve redox balance, and enhance cellular repair mechanisms in the cochlea.

In addition to its effects on sirtuin activation, NR has been shown to influence metabolic pathways associated with lipid handling in cochlear cells. Recent studies indicate that NR modulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathways, leading to further upregulation of lipid droplet-associated proteins such as CIDEC and PLIN1 (Ege et al., 2024; Okur et al., 2023). This regulation of lipid metabolism may serve to create an additional energy reservoir within cells and protect against lipid peroxidation—a process that can exacerbate oxidative damage in metabolically active tissues like the cochlea.

While direct modulation of mechanotransduction (MET) channel proteins such as TMC1 and TMC2 by NR has not been definitively demonstrated, the general improvement in mitochondrial quality and the reduction of oxidative stress through NR-induced NAD⁺ replenishment may indirectly stabilize these critical channels. As mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS accumulation have been implicated in the disruption of MET channel function, NR's potential to restore the bioenergetic profile of cochlear hair cells through sirtuin-mediated deacetylation and improved lipid metabolism represents a compelling rationale for its use in ARHL (Ege et al., 2024; Sharma et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the repurposing of nicotinamide riboside for Age-Related Hearing Loss is that NR supplementation will restore and maintain sufficient intracellular NAD⁺ levels in cochlear hair cells, thereby reactivating critical sirtuin pathways and improving mitochondrial performance. In the proposed treatment model, NR is expected to boost NAD⁺ levels in aged cochlear cells, resulting in enhanced deacetylation of PGC-1α by SIRT1 and SIRT3 activation within the mitochondria. This cascade of molecular events is predicted to promote mitochondrial biogenesis, improve ATP production, and reduce oxidative stress through more efficient scavenging of ROS. In turn, these effects should provide a more stable cellular environment that can sustain the energy-dependent processes critical for mechanotransduction.

In preclinical murine models, administration of NR at doses approximating 500 mg/kg/day has been shown to elevate cochlear NAD⁺ levels significantly. This biochemical restoration correlates with improved auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds, as evidenced by increased amplitudes in Wave I and Wave III, which reflect cochlear and auditory nerve function, respectively (Okur et al., 2023). The maintenance of synaptic ribbon counts in the inner hair cells—which serve as key anatomical markers for synaptic integrity—is another expected outcome of NR treatment that supports the notion of restored communication between hair cells and auditory neurons.

Moreover, the activation of PPAR signaling pathways by NR may enhance the expression of lipid droplet-associated proteins like CIDEC and PLIN1. These proteins are implicated in the regulation of cellular energy storage and metabolism, providing an additional layer of protection against the oxidative challenges that occur in aging cochlear cells (Ege et al., 2024; Biswas & Biotechnology Kiosk, 2020). Although direct assessments of MET channel proteins (TMC1 and TMC2) remain to be fully elucidated, the preservation of mitochondrial function and reduction in ROS are crucial for the proper functioning of these channels, thereby potentially maintaining normal mechanotransduction and auditory perception (Okur et al., 2023; Ege et al., 2024).

Furthermore, NR’s influence on reducing hair cell apoptosis could contribute to an overall preservation of cochlear structure and function. By mitigating the processes that lead to synaptic loss and neuronal degradation, NR is anticipated not only to halt further auditory decline but also, to some extent, reverse some aspects of the damage incurred during aging. The cumulative effect of these cellular and biochemical improvements would be measured by advanced electrophysiological techniques such as ABR testing, coupled with histological assessments showing reduced synaptic ribbon loss and lower incidence of hair cell death (Okur et al., 2023; Ege et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
The current literature provides a robust scientific rationale for repurposing nicotinamide riboside as a therapeutic candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss. One of the strongest aspects of NR is its natural derivation from vitamin B3 and its efficient, well-characterized synthesis and purification routes, which facilitate its use as an orally bioavailable nutraceutical. The compound’s reputation for safety and tolerability in both preclinical and early-phase clinical studies further supports its translational potential (Alegre & Pastore, 2023; Sharma et al., 2022).

Mechanistically, the ability of NR to restore NAD⁺ levels and thereby enhance the activity of NAD⁺-dependent sirtuins such as SIRT1 and SIRT3 is particularly attractive in the context of ARHL. These sirtuin pathways are well established as mediators of mitochondrial quality control, with SIRT1 promoting the deacetylation and activation of PGC-1α to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and SIRT3 directly safeguarding mitochondrial enzymes against oxidative damage (Lloret & Beal, 2019; Ege et al., 2024). Given that the pathophysiology of ARHL involves mitochondrial dysfunction, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and subsequent impairment of energy-dependent processes in cochlear hair cells, targeting these pathways is a logical approach.

Preclinical studies have already demonstrated that NR supplementation can partially restore cochlear NAD⁺ levels in aged mice, with corresponding improvements in auditory function as measured by ABR thresholds and preservation of synaptic structures (Okur et al., 2023). These findings suggest that NR has a multidimensional mode of action that addresses several critical mechanisms implicated in cochlear aging, including metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. The indirect benefits that may accrue to MET channel proteins such as TMC1 and TMC2 via enhanced mitochondrial quality and decreased ROS further underscore the potential for NR to restore mechanotransduction in aged ears (Ege et al., 2024; Biswas & Biotechnology Kiosk, 2020).

From a therapeutic history standpoint, although NR has not yet been evaluated in dedicated clinical trials for ARHL, its extensive study in metabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular conditions establishes a well-documented safety profile and efficacy in improving cellular bioenergetics. The absence of human clinical data specifically for ARHL constitutes a notable gap, but the encouraging preclinical data and the overlap in the underlying molecular mechanisms provide a compelling rationale for further investigation. Future clinical trials targeting auditory outcomes in elderly patients will be essential to validate the findings from animal models and to optimize dosing regimens that translate the murine benefits into human therapeutics (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

One potential challenge in the clinical translation of NR for ARHL lies in the variability of dosing strategies observed in preclinical models. In mice, doses around 500 mg/kg/day have shown promising results; however, careful pharmacokinetic and dose-escalation studies will be necessary to ensure similar efficacy and safety in humans over long-term administration. Furthermore, while the activation of sirtuins and the subsequent downstream effects on mitochondrial function are well supported, the direct mechanistic links to the stabilization or upregulation of MET channel proteins, including TMC1 and TMC2, remain inferential at present. This represents an area where additional targeted research is warranted to elucidate the precise molecular interactions involved.

In summary, the strengths of nicotinamide riboside as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss are considerable. Its natural origin, efficient synthesis, proven oral bioavailability, and extensively characterized mechanism of action—which includes the restoration of NAD⁺ levels leading to sirtuin activation, improved mitochondrial biogenesis, and reduced oxidative stress—provide a sound scientific basis for its application in ARHL (Alegre & Pastore, 2023; Ege et al., 2024). Preclinical evidence from murine models indicating improved auditory function and preservation of synaptic integrity offers further support to the concept that NR may be capable of not only halting further auditory decline but also potentially reversing some aspects of cochlear degeneration (Okur et al., 2023).

However, notable weaknesses include the current lack of direct clinical evidence in human ARHL, the need for further clarification of NR’s direct effects on mechanotransduction channel proteins, and uncertainties related to optimal dosing regimens for long-term administration in elderly populations. Addressing these gaps through dedicated clinical studies will be essential to advance NR from a promising candidate in preclinical research to a validated therapy for ARHL.

Overall, the convergence of metabolic, mitochondrial, and oxidative stress pathways in the pathogenesis of ARHL creates a unique opportunity for NR to be repurposed as a therapeutic intervention in this domain. The extensive preclinical data, combined with a favorable safety profile documented in human studies addressing related conditions, makes a compelling argument for further investment in research on NR in the context of age-related auditory decline. Future studies should incorporate rigorous assessments of auditory function, molecular markers for sirtuin activity, mitochondrial quality, and direct analyses of MET channel integrity to fully delineate the therapeutic benefits and mechanisms of NR in ARHL. The evidence to date suggests that NR not only holds promise for preserving auditory function but may also offer broader benefits in terms of overall cellular health and longevity, making it a strong candidate for inclusion in the drug development pipeline targeting Age-Related Hearing Loss (Alegre & Pastore, 2023; Ege et al., 2024; Okur et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2022).

In conclusion, based on the comprehensive review of biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature available, nicotinamide riboside demonstrates significant potential for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss. Its multifaceted mechanism of action—encompassing NAD⁺ replenishment, sirtuin pathway activation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and oxidative stress mitigation—addresses several of the fundamental pathophysiological processes underlying age-related auditory decline. While the lack of direct clinical evidence in human ARHL is a limitation, the robust preclinical data and established safety profile in humans across related indications provide a strong foundation for further investigation. Advancing NR through targeted clinical trials with well-defined auditory endpoints will be instrumental in determining whether the promising results observed in animal models can be replicated in the human population. Given the significant unmet need for effective treatments for ARHL and the compelling mechanistic rationale supporting NR’s therapeutic effects, it is recommended that further research, including dose optimization, long-term safety evaluation, and direct assessments of target proteins such as TMC1 and TMC2, be prioritized. This strategy could ultimately lead to a novel, clinically valid approach in mitigating age-related hearing loss, thereby greatly improving quality of life in the aging population (Alegre & Pastore, 2023; Ege et al., 2024; Okur et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2022).
