Proposal for N-acetylcysteine

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) is a small, thiol-containing molecule originally derived as a deacetylated form of the naturally occurring amino acid L‐cysteine. It can be synthesized via chemical acetylation of cysteine, yielding a compound that both serves as an antioxidant and a precursor for intracellular glutathione synthesis. NAC belongs to a class of compounds known as thiol antioxidants, which are widely used in medicine both as mucolytic agents (for example, in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and as an antidote in acetaminophen overdose. Over the past several decades the clinical utility of NAC has been well established due to its capacity to replenish intracellular pools of glutathione (GSH), a major endogenously produced antioxidant. This class of compounds has also been explored for their cytoprotective properties in settings of oxidative stress beyond liver toxicity, and in several ototoxicity and noise-induced injury models, making them attractive candidates for repurposing in sensorineural conditions like age-related hearing loss (Ackah et al., 2010; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007).

Therapeutic History:
NAC has a long history of use both in clinical and preclinical settings. Clinically, NAC is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for acetaminophen overdose because of its proven ability to rapidly restore hepatic GSH levels and neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, NAC is used as a mucolytic agent via its direct disruption of disulfide bonds in mucus glycoproteins. Over the years, substantial preclinical research has investigated its role in preventing cochlear damage induced by noise, aminoglycoside antibiotics, and platinum-based chemotherapy agents. For example, in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), several studies using animal models have demonstrated that NAC can attenuate temporary threshold shifts and reduce outer hair cell (OHC) loss by replenishing glutathione, thereby counteracting ROS overproduction following acoustic stress (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007; Jackson et al., 2010). Moreover, genetic mouse models with glutathione metabolism deficiencies have shown that supplementation with NAC prevents progressive inner hair cell (IHC) degeneration and preserves auditory brainstem response thresholds, suggesting a protective mechanism reliant on oxidative stress mitigation (Ding et al., 2016). Although NAC has not been extensively tested in dedicated clinical trials for ARHL, exploratory trials and preclinical studies in models of presbycusis have been undertaken. For instance, in the senescence-accelerated prone 8 (SAMP8) mouse model, NAC treatment via drinking water produced significantly lower auditory brainstem thresholds and improved hair cell survival, with indications of reduced cochlear oxidative stress (Marie et al., 2018). Additionally, systematic reviews of antioxidants in different forms of sensorineural hearing loss have identified NAC as a promising candidate, albeit with some variability in effect depending on the etiology of hearing loss (Abbasi et al., 2021; Kranzer et al., 2015). Thus, while NAC’s historical use has been robust in other indications, its repurposing for ARHL builds on a growing body of preclinical evidence that links oxidative stress—notably glutathione depletion—with cochlear degeneration.

Mechanism of Action:
The principal mechanism of action of NAC in the context of auditory protection is its role as a glutathione precursor. Intracellular glutathione, a tripeptide composed of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine, is the major antioxidant in most cell types and is essential for neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during cellular metabolism. NAC provides cysteine, the rate-limiting substrate for glutathione synthesis, thereby restoring depleted GSH levels that occur in cochlear hair cells during oxidative stress (Ding et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2021). As cochlear hair cells age, they experience a decline in antioxidant defense, leading to enhanced lipid peroxidation and oxidation of key cellular components such as membrane proteins and ion channels. Recent studies have demonstrated that the depletion of intracellular glutathione in aged hair cells exacerbates oxidative damage, which alters the function of the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) apparatus and impairs calcium regulatory proteins like PMCA2 (plasma membrane Ca²⁺-ATPase 2) and SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase) (Ackah et al., 2010; Bai et al., 2022). NAC’s antioxidant properties extend beyond mere glutathione replenishment; its free thiol group enables direct scavenging of highly reactive radicals such as hydroxyl and hypochlorous acid radicals, thereby reducing lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in the cochlear cellular membranes (Baek et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022). In preclinical auditory explant models, NAC administration was correlated with reduced activation of pro-apoptotic pathways such as caspase cascades, particularly in settings of ototoxic drug exposure and noise trauma (Bai et al., 2021; Moon et al., 2011). Furthermore, by mitigating ROS accumulation, NAC indirectly prevents the oxidative inactivation of calcium handling proteins. Oxidative modification of PMCA2 and SERCA can lead to disrupted calcium homeostasis, which in turn affects the gating of the MET channel, an essential component for mechanoelectrical transduction in hair cells. Although direct interaction of NAC with these specific ion pumps has not been fully elucidated in the literature, studies suggest that preserving the redox environment facilitates proper function of these proteins (Ding et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2021). Thus, the multifaceted biochemical actions of NAC—increasing glutathione, scavenging ROS, and indirectly supporting membrane protein functionality—form the basis for its anticipated otoprotective effects in aging cochlear hair cells.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis driving the repurposing of NAC for ARHL is that by restoring intracellular glutathione and neutralizing ROS, it can prevent or mitigate oxidative damage in aging cochlear hair cells. In the proposed assay, application of NAC at a concentration range of 100–500 μM is expected to replenish depleted GSH levels in aged hair cells, thereby reducing lipid peroxidation of membrane lipids and minimizing protein oxidation of critical components such as the MET channel complex (Unknown Reference). Preclinical evidence from ototoxicity models has demonstrated that NAC treatment preserves hair cell viability and maintains auditory thresholds, even in models where glutathione metabolism is compromised (Ding et al., 2016; Marie et al., 2018). It is anticipated that NAC will yield observable improvements in cell viability assays, lower levels of biochemical markers of oxidative stress (e.g., lipid peroxidation products), and preservation of electrophysiological indicators of cochlear function such as auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds. Expression of key proteins like PMCA2 and SERCA are known to be present and necessary for normal cochlear function. Although direct measurements of MET channel activity, PMCA2, or SERCA function were not detailed in the context provided, the literature consistently implicates oxidative stress-induced disruption of these proteins as central to ARHL pathology (Ackah et al., 2010; Bai et al., 2022). Therefore, by protecting the integrity of these ion handling systems through GSH restoration and ROS neutralization, NAC is expected to maintain proper calcium homeostasis and ensure efficient gating of the MET channels. The anticipated effect is a delay in the progression of ARHL, as demonstrated by preserved auditory function in aging animal models. The observed improvements in both in vitro cochlear explant models and in vivo measurements in noise-induced hearing loss models support this expectation (Bai et al., 2021; Jackson et al., 2010).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, NAC emerges as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss, with several key strengths supporting its potential. Its well-established clinical safety profile—proven through decades of use in acetaminophen overdose and as a mucolytic—ensures that the risk of adverse effects is relatively low when compared to many novel compounds (Ackah et al., 2010; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007). Preclinical studies in diverse models of ototoxicity and noise-induced hearing loss have consistently demonstrated that NAC provides otoprotection by replenishing intracellular glutathione and mitigating ROS-mediated damage, which is mechanistically relevant to ARHL. The extensive literature supporting NAC’s ability to reduce lipid peroxidation, prevent activation of apoptotic pathways in cochlear hair cells, and indirectly maintain the functionality of critical protein complexes such as the MET channel complex, PMCA2, and SERCA collectively provide robust biochemical and preclinical evidence (Ding et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2022). In the proposed model, NAC is expected to restore redox homeostasis by delivering cysteine for GSH synthesis, counteracting age-associated oxidative stress that contributes to cochlear hair cell degeneration and, consequently, auditory dysfunction.

A notable strength of NAC is its multimodal mechanism of action. Not only does it serve as a precursor for glutathione synthesis, but its intrinsic free radical scavenging properties also directly neutralize deleterious ROS, thereby enhancing overall cellular resistance to oxidative insult (Baek et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2021). Furthermore, the compound’s indirect effects on maintaining calcium homeostatic proteins such as PMCA2 and SERCA—key players in sustaining the normal function of cochlear hair cells via proper calcium regulation—reinforce its potential utility in preserving the complex process of mechanotransduction that is impaired in aging (Ding et al., 2016). Its documented efficacy in various animal studies, including in models with glutathione depletion and preclinical models of both noise-induced damage and ototoxicity, adds significant weight to the rationale for its repurposing in ARHL (Marie et al., 2018; Abbasi et al., 2021).

Nevertheless, several weaknesses must also be considered. Despite extensive preclinical evidence, there is currently limited direct clinical research specifically targeting age-related hearing loss with NAC. Most clinical data relate to its use in acute insults such as sudden sensorineural hearing loss or noise-induced hearing loss (Bai et al., 2022; Kranzer et al., 2015). Additionally, while the proposed mechanism implicates preservation of MET channel function and calcium homeostasis via protection of PMCA2 and SERCA, the current literature does not offer detailed mechanistic studies that explicitly delineate these interactions in the context of aging cochlear cells. Such gaps underscore the need for future targeted studies to directly assess the effects of NAC on these molecular targets in ARHL models. Moreover, the optimal dosing range (100–500 μM in vitro) needs careful translation to relevant in vivo dosing regimens that can achieve the desired therapeutic concentrations in cochlear tissues without eliciting off-target effects (Ding et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2021).

In summary, NAC’s robust safety profile, historical use in related indications, and compelling preclinical evidence supporting its antioxidant and cytoprotective functions make it an attractive candidate for repurposing in age-related hearing loss. Its ability to replenish intracellular glutathione, neutralize ROS, and potentially stabilize key proteins involved in mechanotransduction and calcium homeostasis aligns well with the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ARHL. However, the relative scarcity of direct clinical studies on ARHL and the need for more detailed mechanistic insights—particularly regarding the preservation of MET channel function and the modulation of PMCA2 and SERCA activity—represent important challenges that must be addressed in future research. Overall, based on the comprehensive literature review across biochemical, preclinical, and clinical domains, NAC appears to be a highly promising therapeutic candidate with strong potential for preventing or slowing the progression of age-related hearing loss (Ding et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2022; Marie et al., 2018).
