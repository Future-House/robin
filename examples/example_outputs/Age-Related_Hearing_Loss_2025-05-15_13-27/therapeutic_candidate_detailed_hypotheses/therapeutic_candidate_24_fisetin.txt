Proposal for Fisetin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fisetin is a naturally occurring flavonol found in a variety of fruits and vegetables such as strawberries, apples, and onions. It belongs to the flavonoid class of polyphenolic compounds that have been widely investigated for their antioxidant and senolytic properties. Fisetin was initially discovered through phytochemical studies and later isolated for its potential to modulate cellular aging. As a senolytic, fisetin has been shown to selectively eliminate senescent cells in various tissues in rodent models, while its antioxidant properties contribute to the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitigation of oxidative damage. This dual functionality—senolysis and antioxidation—is the hallmark of its class; other flavonols have been used in diverse experimental settings to modulate aging and inflammation in preclinical studies (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 26–27; Castañeda et al., 2019, pp. 5–8).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, flavonols such as quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin have been explored in both clinical and experimental contexts for a range of age-related disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and vascular dysfunction. Fisetin, in particular, has been evaluated in aged rodent models where oral administration at doses between 20 and 50 mg/kg led to a reduction in senescence markers like p16^INK4a and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) in multiple organs. Although there are no reported clinical trials or registered studies directly evaluating fisetin for age-related hearing loss (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), its pharmacological profile provides a strong rationale for repurposing this compound in auditory research. Previous evidence from related flavonols in traditional oriental medicine indicates that compounds with similar antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms contribute to protecting cochlear structures and preserving hearing function (Castañeda et al., 2019, pp. 24–28; Ege et al., 2024, pp. 3–6).

Mechanism of Action:
Fisetin exerts its effects through multiple mechanisms at the molecular level. Foremost, it acts as a senolytic by targeting and clearing senescent cells. Senescent cells accumulate in aging tissues and secrete a pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that disrupts normal tissue homeostasis. In animal models, fisetin administration has been observed to reduce the expression of senescence markers, which is associated with a decrease in inflammatory cytokines. This is particularly relevant for the aging cochlea, where inflammation and disrupted ion channel function contribute to the deterioration of mechanotransduction.
In parallel, fisetin is a potent antioxidant that directly scavenges reactive oxygen species. The accumulation of ROS in cochlear hair cells leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and subsequent apoptotic cell death. By reducing ROS levels, fisetin helps to maintain cellular membrane integrity and preserves the structure and function of hair cell stereocilia that house the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channels critical for auditory function. Its ability to modulate pathways involving NRF2, SIRT1, and the PI3K/Akt axis has been reported in other tissues, suggesting that similar protective molecular interactions could occur in cochlear cells (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 26–27; Koo et al., 2024, pp. 16–17).
Moreover, fisetin’s senolytic action is thought to indirectly improve the antioxidant defense system by eliminating cells that contribute disproportionally to inflammation and oxidative stress. This clearance of dysfunctional senescent supporting cells in the cochlea could reduce the release of SASP factors that interfere with the expression of ion channels and alter membrane lipid composition, thereby preserving the delicate balance required for efficient mechanotransduction (Yang et al., 2022, pp. 12–13; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 15–16).

Expected Effect:
In the context of age-related hearing loss, the expected outcome of fisetin treatment is multifaceted. By clearing senescent cells from the cochlea, fisetin should reduce the local burden of inflammatory cytokines and SASP mediators that disrupt cochlear homeostasis and impair the function of supporting cells. This, in turn, would help maintain the structural integrity of the cochlear sensory epithelium and preserve the function of hair cells. The antioxidant properties of fisetin are anticipated to protect the hair cell stereocilia from ROS-mediated damage, thereby stabilizing the MET channels and ensuring proper ion channel gating and membrane integrity. The expected biochemical effects include reduced expression of pro-inflammatory markers, decreased lipid peroxidation in cochlear membranes, and restoration of mitochondrial function in hair cells and supporting cells. These outcomes are based on the broader literature indicating that modulation of oxidative stress and cellular senescence is critical for delaying cochlear degeneration (Paciello et al., 2023, pp. 16–18; Teraoka et al., 2024, pp. 9–10).
Molecular targets relevant in the auditory system include the expression of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in both hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons, as these sirtuins have been strongly associated with protecting against oxidative stress and apoptosis in cochlear tissues. Fisetin’s previously demonstrated impact on these pathways supports its anticipated role in preserving mechanotransduction in the inner ear (Koo et al., 2024, pp. 4–5; Ege et al., 2024, pp. 11–13).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on a comprehensive review of the literature, fisetin shows significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss. The strengths of fisetin lie in its dual mechanism of action; it not only functions as a senolytic agent capable of clearing detrimental senescent cells but also exhibits robust antioxidant properties that can mitigate ROS-induced damage. These mechanisms are highly relevant to the pathophysiological processes observed in the aging cochlea, where cellular senescence, SASP-mediated inflammation, and oxidative stress play major roles in the deterioration of auditory function. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic profile evidenced by efficacious dosing in rodent models (20–50 mg/kg orally) adds to its translational potential for further preclinical studies.
However, there are some weaknesses to consider. Direct evidence for fisetin’s efficacy specifically in models of hearing loss remains sparse, and no clinical trials currently evaluate its use in auditory degeneration (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while the biochemical framework is promising, the inner ear presents unique challenges regarding drug delivery and bioavailability, especially in targeting the cochlear microenvironment without off-target effects. There may also be concerns related to the optimal dosing required to achieve sufficient senolytic and antioxidant effects in the cochlea compared to other organs. Despite these challenges, parallels drawn from studies on related flavonols and senolytics in age-related diseases provide a mechanistic rationale that supports further investigation. Overall, fisetin represents a compelling candidate for the treatment of age-related hearing loss, warranting additional preclinical validation and more targeted in vitro and in vivo studies to elucidate its specific effects on cochlear tissue homeostasis and mechanotransduction integrity (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 26–27; Castañeda et al., 2019, pp. 24–28; Koo et al., 2024, pp. 22–23).
