Proposal for Quercetin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Quercetin (Sigma #Q4951) is a naturally occurring flavonoid widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and various medicinal plants. It belongs to the polyphenol class of compounds, which has been extensively studied for its antioxidant properties and, more recently, for senolytic activity when used in combination with other agents such as dasatinib. Quercetin was originally isolated from plant sources through phytochemical screening and has since been synthetically reproduced and purified for experimental and clinical research. Compounds in the flavonoid family, such as quercetin, have historically been used for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects in various diseases, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurodegenerative disorders (Liu et al., 2021). Its inclusion in senolytic cocktails alongside dasatinib highlights its capacity to modulate aging pathways by selectively eliminating senescent cells, which is a property that has generated significant interest in repurposing it for age-related conditions including Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL).

Therapeutic History:
Quercetin has a rich history of investigation as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent in both preclinical and clinical settings. Its biochemical actions have been documented in numerous animal and in vitro studies where it has offered protection against oxidative damage in various tissues. In auditory research, quercetin has been evaluated for its otoprotective effects in models of drug-induced ototoxicity—the compound has been shown to protect against cisplatin-induced hair cell loss in zebrafish embryos and guinea pig cochlea, suggesting potential benefits for auditory cells (Liu et al., 2021; Castañeda et al., 2019). Furthermore, within traditional oriental medicine, quercetin, as a constituent of Ginkgo biloba extract, has been part of therapeutic formulas that improve auditory thresholds and preserve cochlear function in rodent models (Castañeda et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2024). Its senolytic activity, especially when combined with dasatinib, has been demonstrated in settings other than the cochlea, such as in pulmonary and renal tissues, indicating its broader applicability as a senotherapeutic (Williams et al., 2024). Although its use specifically in ARHL has been primarily preclinical—with no registered clinical trials targeting hearing loss (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—the compound’s documented effects in protecting cochlear cells from oxidative insults suggest promise. Additionally, the oral dosing studies in mice indicate that quercetin is taken up by the cochlea without overt toxicity, further supporting its potential repurposing for ARHL (Shi et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
Quercetin exerts its beneficial effects through multiple interrelated molecular mechanisms. Primarily, it acts as a potent antioxidant. At the biochemical level, quercetin scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) by donating electrons and hydrogen atoms via its hydroxyl groups, effectively neutralizing free radicals and preventing lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes (Tavanai & Mohammadkhani, 2017; Deepika & Maurya, 2022). This free radical scavenging is particularly critical in the cochlea, where oxidative stress is a well-established mediator of hair cell damage and consequent hearing loss. The compound is also known to activate endogenous antioxidant defense pathways, including the Nrf2 signaling cascade, which results in the upregulation of cytoprotective enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutathione S-transferases, thereby providing a sustained defense against oxidative insult (Liu et al., 2021; Sánchez-Rodríguez et al., 2016).

In addition to its direct antioxidant property, quercetin exhibits senolytic activity; it selectively induces apoptosis in senescent cells through modulation of key regulators such as p16^INK4a, p21, p53, and by influencing the AMPK pathway, which in turn may restore cellular homeostasis (Liu et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2024). The clearance of senescent cells is particularly significant in the context of ARHL because senescent cells in the cochlea can secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix-degrading enzymes (the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, SASP) that exacerbate local tissue damage and impair mechanotransduction. Therefore, quercetin’s ability to reduce the burden of senescent cells may contribute to preserving a healthy cochlear microenvironment.

Moreover, quercetin has been demonstrated to interact directly with ion channels implicated in auditory function. Molecular docking studies have revealed that quercetin stably binds to the activation pocket of key potassium channels such as Kv7.4 and the large-conductance Ca^2+-activated potassium (BK) channels (Shi et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2022). These channels are essential for maintaining ionic homeostasis in the cochlea, facilitating proper repolarization of hair cells after mechanotransduction, and ensuring the precise timing of auditory signal transduction. By potentiating the activity of these channels, quercetin may help maintain or even enhance the delicate balance required for normal cochlear function.

On a cytoskeletal level, lipid peroxidation of membrane components in stereocilia—innovative mechanotransducing structures of hair cells—leads to increased membrane stiffness and impaired gating of the mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) channels. Quercetin’s antioxidant properties help to prevent lipid peroxidation, thereby preserving membrane fluidity and stabilizing the association between the membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton (Gao et al., 2022, as cited in the hypothesis; Shi et al., 2024). Collectively, these molecular interactions place quercetin as a multi-mechanistic compound that targets oxidative stress, cellular senescence, and ion channel modulation with potential benefits for maintaining both structural and functional integrity of cochlear cells.

Expected Effect:
Within the context of the proposed assay, it is anticipated that quercetin at a concentration of approximately 50 μM will effectively reduce oxidative stress in the cochlea by scavenging free radicals and thereby protecting against lipid peroxidation in the stereocilia membranes. This antioxidant activity is expected to prevent the stiffening of the plasma membrane, which is crucial to maintaining the functionality of MET channels—proteins that are expressed in cochlear hair cells and are essential for mechanotransduction (Shi et al., 2024; Sánchez-Rodríguez et al., 2016).

Furthermore, based on its senolytic properties demonstrated in other tissues, quercetin is hypothesized to selectively clear senescent cells within the aging cochlea. Senescent cells in the cochlea contribute to a pro-inflammatory microenvironment through the secretion of SASP factors that can disrupt normal cochlear function. By reducing the burden of these cells, quercetin would be expected to lower local inflammation and restore a state of homeostasis, thereby protecting hair cells and supporting the integrity of the cellular architecture necessary for proper mechanotransduction (Liu et al., 2021; Ege et al., 2024).

In support of this, preclinical evidence from rodent models indicates that oral administration of quercetin leads to cochlear uptake without significant toxicity, and, when combined with dasatinib, similar senolytic cocktails have shown efficacy in clearing senescent cell populations (Williams et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024). Additionally, molecular docking analyses have confirmed that quercetin interacts with potassium channels such as Kv7.4, which are crucial for auditory processing, suggesting that its binding may help stabilize ion channel function in aged cochlear cells (Shi et al., 2024; Castañeda et al., 2019).

Thus, the expected outcome in the proposed experimental assay is a dual benefit: a reduction in oxidative stress markers (e.g., lower lipid peroxidation levels and reduced production of ROS) and a selective depletion of senescent cochlear cells, leading to the preservation of the mechanotransduction apparatus of the auditory hair cells. This should, in turn, result in improved auditory function as measured by electrophysiological parameters and possibly histological analyses of cochlear tissue integrity.

Overall Evaluation:
Quercetin presents as an attractive therapeutic candidate for ARHL due to its multi-modal mode of action, which includes potent antioxidant activity, senolytic effects, and the modulation of key ion channels involved in auditory mechanotransduction. One of the major strengths of quercetin is its natural origin and long history of safe use in dietary and medicinal contexts, which is supported by extensive preclinical data demonstrating its ability to reduce oxidative stress–induced damage in various tissues, including auditory structures (Liu et al., 2021; Castañeda et al., 2019). Its capacity to scavenge ROS and prevent lipid peroxidation is well documented, and these actions are particularly relevant to the preservation of mechanotransduction in cochlear hair cells, which are highly sensitive to oxidative insults (Tavanai & Mohammadkhani, 2017).

Another significant strength lies in its reported senolytic activity. Although direct evidence for quercetin clearing senescent cells specifically in the cochlea is not yet robust, the mechanism—largely elucidated in other tissues involving the upregulation of apoptosis in senescent cells via modulation of p16, p21, and AMPK signaling—offers a promising avenue for intervention in ARHL, where chronic inflammation and cellular senescence play critical roles (Liu et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2024). The added potential to modulate potassium channels (Kv7.4 and BK channels) enhances its profile by directly impacting cochlear ionic homeostasis and mechanotransduction, which are central to auditory function (Shi et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2022).

However, several weaknesses and challenges need to be acknowledged. First, despite the promising preclinical data, there is a notable absence of clinical trial evidence directly assessing quercetin for ARHL (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This gap highlights the need for rigorous clinical studies to validate its efficacy and safety in human patients suffering from ARHL. Second, while the antioxidant and senolytic properties of quercetin are well characterized in many contexts, the complexity of the cochlear microenvironment and the intricacies of mechanotransduction mean that the translation of these effects to sustained auditory function preservation may be challenging. For instance, the relationship between lipid peroxidation in stereocilia membranes and the gating of MET channels, although theoretically supported, requires more precise mechanistic and kinetic studies to determine whether quercetin can effectively maintain the dynamic membrane interactions over prolonged periods (Shi et al., 2024; Castañeda et al., 2019).

Another consideration involves the dosing and potential off-target effects of quercetin. While studies indicate that concentrations around 50 μM can be effective in vitro and that oral dosing in mice results in cochlear uptake without toxicity, the optimal dosing regimen in humans remains uncertain. Moreover, quercetin has been shown in some studies to exert pro-oxidant effects at high concentrations, which could potentially exacerbate oxidative damage if not properly controlled (Deepika & Maurya, 2022). This dual nature necessitates careful dose optimization and a thorough evaluation of its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the cochlear context.

From a mechanistic standpoint, while the interactions of quercetin with cellular antioxidant pathways, senescence markers, and ion channels are encouraging, the evidence supporting its direct action on the mechanotransduction apparatus is still largely indirect. Most studies have focused on the overall protection of hair cells and the preservation of auditory thresholds rather than a detailed analysis of MET channel function and stereocilia structural integrity. Thus, further studies explicitly designed to assess mechanotransduction parameters in the aging cochlea will be crucial.

In summary, the overall evaluation of quercetin as a therapeutic candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss is cautiously optimistic. The compound’s natural origin, established antioxidant capacity, potential senolytic activity, and interactions with key ion channels make it a promising candidate for further investigation. However, significant research gaps remain, particularly in translating preclinical findings to the clinical setting and in elucidating its precise effects on mechanotransduction in cochlear hair cells. Future studies should focus on detailed mechanistic investigations, dose optimization, and carefully designed clinical trials to determine whether quercetin can be effectively repurposed to mitigate ARHL (Liu et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ege et al., 2024).

Overall, quercetin presents a multifaceted therapeutic strategy for ARHL by addressing both the oxidative and senescence components of cochlear degeneration while potentially stabilizing the ion channel activity necessary for mechanotransduction. These features offer a strong rationale for further preclinical and clinical development, despite the current gaps in direct evidence regarding senolytic clearance in cochlear cells and the explicit preservation of mechanotransduction dynamics.
