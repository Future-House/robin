Proposal for Rolipram

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rolipram is a synthetic small‐molecule drug that serves as a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase‐4 (PDE4), a key enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in various cell types. Rolipram was originally discovered in the early 1980s, emerging from extensive pharmacological investigations into PDEs, and rapidly established itself as the prototypical PDE4 inhibitor due to its high selectivity for the PDE4 enzyme family (Neale, 2012). Structurally, rolipram belongs to the class of PDE4 inhibitors, compounds that have been widely studied for their capacity to elevate intracellular cAMP levels by blocking its degradation; this cascade is crucial for modulating inflammatory responses, neuronal plasticity, and cell survival. The compound is well known for its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, a property that has allowed it to be tested in various central nervous system (CNS) indications such as depression, cognitive impairment, and neurodegenerative diseases (Schudt et al., 2011). As a member of the PDE4 inhibitor class, rolipram shares several common features with its successors and analogues in its ability to modulate cellular signaling via cAMP, but it is historically noted for both its potent biochemical activity and a challenging tolerability profile due to side effects such as nausea and emesis. Given its extensive history and proven bioactivity in modulating cAMP-dependent pathways, rolipram has been proposed for repurposing as a therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss (ARHL) based on the rationale that increasing cAMP levels in cochlear cells could counteract inflammation-driven degeneration; this candidate hypothesis focuses on elevating cAMP in cochlear hair cells and supporting cells, thereby activating protein kinase A (PKA)–mediated phosphorylation of CREB, suppressing NF-κB signaling and ultimately reducing inflammatory damage that contributes to mechanotransduction (MET) channel downregulation in aged ears (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Rolipram’s therapeutic history spans several decades of preclinical and early clinical testing, primarily in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative contexts. In the past, rolipram was explored for its antidepressant effects and as a potential neuroprotective agent in models of spinal cord injury, Alzheimer’s disease, and other conditions characterized by excessive inflammation and neuronal loss (Schudt et al., 2011; Hemachandran et al., 2024). Preclinical studies using animal models have demonstrated the efficacy of rolipram in raising intracellular cAMP levels, thereby activating downstream PKA signaling and promoting CREB phosphorylation; these events are well known to support neuronal survival, axonal regeneration, and synaptic plasticity (Kranz et al., 2014; Hemachandran, 2019). In the context of hearing research specifically, although direct clinical trial data remain sparse—as evidenced by a recent search on ClinicalTrials.gov showing no listed trials for rolipram in hearing disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—a number of preclinical studies have investigated rolipram in cochlear explant models and animal studies related to synaptic regeneration after noise-induced injury (Hemachandran, 2019; Hemachandran et al., 2024). These studies indicate that rolipram can promote the regeneration of afferent synapses connecting inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), a process likely mediated through cAMP/PKA signaling pathways. Additionally, related literature on PDE4 inhibitors has demonstrated their anti-inflammatory capabilities in other models ranging from central nervous system lesions to autoimmune disorders (Crocetti et al., 2022), thereby providing supplementary evidence of their potential benefits in inflammatory conditions that could extend to the cochlea. Overall, while rolipram has not yet been used in clinical settings specifically targeting ARHL, its preclinical profile—spanning both central and peripheral neural protection—provides a strong rationale for further investigation as a repurposed therapeutic candidate in the field of hearing loss.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, rolipram exerts its pharmacological effects by selectively inhibiting PDE4, thereby preventing the hydrolysis of cAMP into its inactive form, 5’AMP. The resultant increase in intracellular cAMP concentrations triggers the activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates various substrates including the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) (Kranz et al., 2014; Hemachandran et al., 2024). This phosphorylation of CREB is particularly important because it enhances the transcription of genes associated with cell survival, neurotrophism, and anti-apoptotic signaling. Another key aspect of rolipram’s mechanism is its ability to downregulate proinflammatory signaling pathways. Elevated cAMP levels result in the suppression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity, a pivotal transcription factor involved in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β (Crocetti et al., 2022; Heckman et al., 2015). This dual action—upregulation of neuroprotective gene expression via the PKA/CREB axis and simultaneous inhibition of NF-κB–mediated proinflammatory cytokine transcription—forms the biochemical basis by which rolipram can reduce inflammation. In the context of cochlear cells, which include sensory hair cells, supporting cells, and spiral ganglion neurons, these intracellular signaling pathways are essential not only for maintaining synaptic function and cell viability but also for preserving the function and expression of ion channels critical for mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) (Hemachandran, 2019; Kranz et al., 2014). Increased levels of cAMP in these cell types are expected to enhance the structural and functional integrity of the actin cytoskeleton, facilitate synaptic repair, and counteract the age-related downregulation of ion channels necessary for proper auditory transduction. Together, these molecular interactions provide a compelling mechanistic rationale for the use of rolipram in mitigating the deleterious effects of cochlear inflammaging, a process characterized by chronic, low-grade inflammation that contributes to age-related hearing loss (Bazard et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
Based on its well-documented mechanism of action, rolipram is hypothesized to elicit several beneficial effects in the cochlea that might counteract the pathophysiology of ARHL. First, by inhibiting PDE4 and elevating intracellular cAMP levels, rolipram is expected to activate PKA, resulting in the phosphorylation of CREB. Enhanced CREB activity will stimulate the transcription of genes involved in cellular survival and synaptogenesis, which may promote the regeneration of cochlear synapses that are typically compromised by chronic noise exposure and aging (Hemachandran et al., 2024; Hemachandran, 2019). The elevation of cAMP will also have an anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing NF-κB signaling and reducing the local production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β—cytokines that are elevated in aged cochlear tissues and contribute to the dysregulation of ion channel expression and function (Crocetti et al., 2022; Bazard et al., 2021). Specifically, the reduction in these inflammatory mediators is anticipated to spare the normal expression and function of MET channels, which are critical for translating mechanical sound vibrations into neural signals; this is particularly important since inflammation-driven MET channel downregulation is one of the contributors to the progressive loss of auditory sensitivity observed in ARHL. Moreover, the enhancement of cytoskeletal dynamics via CREB-dependent transcription may further contribute to the stabilization of hair cell and supporting cell architecture, thereby preserving the overall mechanical and electrical integrity of the cochlear sensory epithelium (Heckman et al., 2015). Preclinical studies in rodent models have suggested that systemic administration of rolipram at doses around 0.5 mg/kg can increase cochlear cAMP levels and promote regenerative responses, although precise dosing regimens and effects on the aged cochlea remain to be fully defined (Hemachandran et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Therefore, the expected overall effect of rolipram in an assay designed for ARHL would include enhanced synaptic repair, reduced inflammatory cytokine expression, preservation of MET channel function, and ultimately stabilization or improvement of auditory function in aged ears.

Overall Evaluation:
Evaluating rolipram as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss reveals a blend of promising molecular rationale with certain translational challenges that must be addressed in further research. One of the major strengths of rolipram is its well-characterized mechanism of action. As a prototypical PDE4 inhibitor, rolipram has been shown across multiple studies to elevate intracellular cAMP levels, thereby activating the PKA/CREB signaling cascade that promotes neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity (Kranz et al., 2014; Hemachandran et al., 2024). This increase in cAMP is also associated with the suppression of proinflammatory NF-κB signaling and the subsequent reduction in cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β, which are critical mediators of chronic inflammation in aging tissues—including the cochlea (Crocetti et al., 2022; Bazard et al., 2021). Given that inflammation and dysregulation of ion channel expression play a pivotal role in the deterioration of auditory function with age, rolipram’s ability to modulate these cellular processes positions it as a highly attractive candidate for combating the mechanisms underlying ARHL.

Moreover, several preclinical studies, including work on cochlear explants and noise-induced synaptopathy models, provide encouraging evidence that PDE4 inhibition with rolipram can promote synaptic regeneration and functional recovery in auditory circuits (Hemachandran, 2019; Hemachandran et al., 2024). Additionally, its CNS-permeant properties and the feasibility of systemic administration are advantageous for non-invasive delivery to the inner ear, an important consideration given the challenges associated with direct cochlear drug delivery (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Taken together, these features underscore rolipram’s potential to not only protect cochlear cells from inflammatory damage but also to actively promote repair mechanisms that could mitigate the progression of ARHL.

However, there are notable weaknesses and challenges that temper this optimism. Historically, rolipram has been associated with a narrow therapeutic window due to significant side effects such as nausea and emesis, which have limited its clinical utility in CNS disorders (Schudt et al., 2011; Neale, 2012). The same side-effect profile could potentially limit its use as a long-term therapy in elderly populations if systemic exposure is not carefully managed. Furthermore, although there is promising preclinical evidence in non-cochlear systems and some indirect data from cochlear models, direct clinical evidence or dedicated in vivo studies specifically addressing the impact of rolipram on age-related cochlear dysfunction are still lacking (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kranz et al., 2014). There is also the challenge of ensuring that the effective concentrations required to achieve cochlear anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects are safely attainable without provoking systemic adverse effects.

Another consideration is the complexity of the inflammatory processes in the aged cochlea. Recent studies have highlighted the multifactorial nature of cochlear inflammaging, involving mitochondrial dysfunction, ion channel dysregulation, and the activation of inflammasomes (Bazard et al., 2021). While rolipram’s modulation of cAMP/PKA/CREB and NF-κB pathways is well established, it remains to be fully elucidated how these effects translate to the intricate microenvironment of the aging cochlea, where interactions among hair cells, supporting cells, and neural components are critical. It will be important to establish not only that rolipram can elevate cAMP in these specific cell types but also that such elevation translates to measurable improvements in ion channel function—for instance, by preserving the normal activity of MET channels, which are essential for mechanotransduction (Hemachandran et al., 2024).

Despite these challenges, strategies to overcome rolipram’s limitations are available. For instance, formulation approaches such as targeted delivery via lipidic nanocapsules have been explored to enhance drug uptake into cochlear cells while minimizing systemic exposure and side effects (Meyer et al., 2012). Such targeted delivery systems could prove particularly useful in the context of ARHL, where localization of the therapeutic effect to the inner ear might allow for lower overall dosing and improved tolerability. Additionally, the development of next-generation PDE4 inhibitors with improved selectivity profiles (minimizing PDE4D-mediated emesis while retaining PDE4B inhibition) may offer a way to harness the beneficial effects of rolipram’s mechanism without incurring its most problematic side effects (Crocetti et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2013).

In summary, the overall evaluation of rolipram as a therapeutic candidate for ARHL is cautiously optimistic. On the strength side, rolipram has a robust and well-documented mechanism of action involving the elevation of intracellular cAMP, activation of the PKA/CREB axis, and concomitant suppression of proinflammatory NF-κB signaling—key pathways that are implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related cochlear degeneration and the downregulation of critical ion channels such as those involved in MET (Kranz et al., 2014; Hemachandran et al., 2024; Bazard et al., 2021). Preclinical data, including studies on synaptic regeneration in cochlear explants and noise-induced injury models, support the notion that PDE4 inhibition can be beneficial for auditory function. Rolipram’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and be administered systemically further enhances its appeal as a minimally invasive therapeutic option. On the weakness side, the historical clinical limitations related to side effects such as nausea and emesis, the lack of direct clinical data in ARHL populations, and the need for optimized, localized cochlear delivery present significant challenges that must be addressed before rolipram can be considered a viable long-term treatment for age-related hearing loss (Schudt et al., 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Thus, while rolipram presents a compelling biochemical rationale and comes with encouraging preclinical evidence with regard to its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective actions in various neural tissues, its application in ARHL will require further dedicated studies. Specifically, there is a need for detailed in vivo investigations in aged animal models that elucidate rolipram’s effect on cochlear cAMP levels, downstream PKA/CREB signaling, preservation of MET channel expression, and overall auditory function. Additionally, exploring advanced drug delivery systems to restrict rolipram’s action to the inner ear could mitigate systemic side effects and improve its tolerability profile in the elderly. If these challenges can be overcome, rolipram or its next-generation analogues might emerge as promising candidates for slowing or reversing the progression of ARHL, addressing a significant unmet medical need in our aging population.

Overall, the strategic repurposing of rolipram for age-related hearing loss is supported by a strong mechanistic foundation and encouraging preclinical data, though clinical translation will depend on overcoming its historical side-effect challenges and validating its efficacy in cochlear-specific contexts. Further research, including rigorous preclinical studies with targeted delivery approaches, is warranted before advancing into human clinical trials.
