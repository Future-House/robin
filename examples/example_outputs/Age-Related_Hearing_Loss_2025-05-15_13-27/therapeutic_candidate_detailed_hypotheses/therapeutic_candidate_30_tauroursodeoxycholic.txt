Proposal for Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid (TUDCA)

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid (TUDCA) as a promising repurposed candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL), organized into detailed sections addressing its overall characteristics, historical uses, molecular mechanisms, expected cellular effects in cochlear hair cells, and an overall assessment of its strengths and limitations.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
TUDCA is a hydrophilic bile acid derivative that is naturally produced in the liver through the conjugation of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) with taurine. Originally isolated from bear bile in traditional Chinese medicine, TUDCA has long been recognized for its hepatoprotective effects and its ability to modulate cellular stress. Modern synthetic processes now yield high‐purity TUDCA (e.g., Sigma #T0261), ensuring reproducibility in research and clinical applications. This compound belongs to the bile acid class—a group of endogenous steroids typically involved in lipid digestion and cholesterol homeostasis—but which in recent decades has been re‐characterized as active signaling molecules. These bile acids are known to influence metabolic regulation, inflammation, and apoptosis through their actions as chemical chaperones and modulators of intracellular signaling pathways. In particular, TUDCA has been extensively studied for its ability to modulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses and the unfolded protein response (UPR), which are processes critical for the survival of numerous cell types under chronic stress conditions (Boatright et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History
Historically, TUDCA has been used clinically to treat cholestatic liver diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis. In these indications, its role in reducing bile acid toxicity and preventing hepatocyte apoptosis has been well documented. Multiple clinical studies have confirmed its safety and tolerability in patients, which strongly implies a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in humans. Over the past decade, TUDCA’s potential has been expanded beyond hepatology into domains of neuroprotection and cytoprotection. Preclinical studies have documented that TUDCA can reduce apoptosis in models of neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). For instance, in retinal models of neurodegeneration and even in animal models for ALS, TUDCA has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and provide neuronal protection via its anti-apoptotic and ER-stress mitigating effects (Boatright et al., 2019; Fu et al., 2021). Although TUDCA has not yet been applied directly in clinical settings for Age-Related Hearing Loss, several preclinical studies have investigated its effects in auditory systems. In particular, experiments using cochlear explants have shown that high concentrations (~500 μM) of TUDCA reduce apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducers such as tunicamycin, while preserving the delicate stereocilia structure critical for mechanotransduction (Hu et al., 2016). The fact that TUDCA has proven efficacious in multiple disease models, ranging from liver diseases to neurodegenerative conditions, suggests that its repurposing for ARHL is plausible given that the underlying molecular pathologies—ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage, and apoptosis—are common to these conditions (Chester et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, TUDCA functions through multiple converging mechanisms that ultimately protect cells from apoptosis triggered by cellular stress. As a chemical chaperone, TUDCA assists in stabilizing protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby mitigating the accumulation of misfolded proteins—a critical event that triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). Under stress conditions, UPR sensors such as PERK, IRE1α, and ATF6 become activated, leading to increased expression of pro-apoptotic factors such as CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein). TUDCA effectively inhibits the induction of CHOP, thereby preventing the downstream cascade that leads to mitochondrial membrane destabilization and caspase activation (Boatright et al., 2019; Kusaczuk, 2019).

Another key aspect of TUDCA’s protective profile is its modulation of intracellular calcium (Ca²⁺) homeostasis. Calcium imbalance in the ER can lead to uncontrolled release of Ca²⁺ into the cytosol, which in turn causes mitochondrial overload and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). TUDCA supports the function of calcium pumps such as the plasma membrane Ca²⁺-ATPase (PMCA) and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA), thereby helping maintain optimal Ca²⁺ concentrations within the ER (Boatright et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2016). By preventing abnormal Ca²⁺ efflux, TUDCA reduces the risk of mitochondrial dysfunction and the activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Through stabilization of ER Ca²⁺, it indirectly supports ATP production by maintaining mitochondrial function (Kusaczuk, 2019; Lamm et al., 2025).

In addition to its chemical chaperone and Ca²⁺-stabilizing activities, TUDCA exerts anti-inflammatory effects by engaging with specific bile acid receptors. Receptors such as TGR5 (also known as GPBAR1) are expressed in many cell types, including neurons and possibly supporting cells in sensory organs. Activation of TGR5 increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP), which leads to downstream anti-inflammatory signaling cascades and the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (Boatright et al., 2019; Khalaf et al., 2022).

Furthermore, TUDCA preserves mitochondrial-ER crosstalk, a critical component in maintaining the health and function of cells under stress. Mitochondrial integrity is essential for preventing the release of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and cytochrome c. In cochlear hair cells, this preservation is vital since the mitochondria not only supply energy for active processes such as Ca²⁺ clearance but also help maintain the structural integrity of highly specialized cellular components like stereocilia (Hu et al., 2016). TUDCA’s ability to support mitochondrial membrane potential and reduce ROS production further underscores its multi-targeted approach against cell death (Duscha, 2015).

Collectively, these actions create an intracellular environment that is resistant to the detrimental effects of chronic ER stress, oxidative damage, and defective Ca²⁺ handling—a profile that is hypothesized to be especially beneficial for aging cochlear hair cells, which experience progressive cellular damage during the natural aging process (Khalaf et al., 2022).

Expected Effect in Cochlear Hair Cells and Assay
In the context of Age-Related Hearing Loss, cochlear hair cells undergo degeneration partly due to an aberrant chronic activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) resulting from ER stress, coupled with mitochondrial dysfunction and cytoskeletal disarray. The stereocilia of hair cells are crucial for mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) and are highly dependent on proper Ca²⁺ homeostasis and robust ATP production. High levels of ER stress and subsequent ROS production can impair these critical processes. Based on in vitro data, treatment of hair cell explants with TUDCA at approximately 500 μM has been shown to significantly reduce apoptosis induced by agents such as tunicamycin, an ER stress inducer, thereby preserving the stereocilia structure (Hu et al., 2016).

In more detail, the proposed mechanism in cochlear hair cells involves TUDCA alleviating UPR activation by limiting the expression of CHOP, reducing the activation of caspases (notably caspase-3 and caspase-9), and maintaining ER Ca²⁺ in a range that avoids hypocalcemic stress on mitochondria (Boatright et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2016). As a result, the mitochondrial-ER crosstalk is conserved, ensuring that oxidative phosphorylation processes remain efficient, and ROS levels remain low. This preservation of mitochondrial function is indispensable for supporting ATP-dependent processes such as Ca²⁺ clearance mediated by PMCA and SERCA, which are necessary for the resetting of hair cell membrane potentials following mechanotransduction events (Kusaczuk, 2019; Lamm et al., 2025).

Furthermore, TUDCA’s action on bile acid receptors like TGR5 may also influence local inflammatory responses within the cochlea. Downregulation of inflammatory markers can further contribute to a reduction in cell stress and improve the overall survival of hair cells. Thus, the expected effect in the proposed assays is multifold: reduced ER stress marker expression, inhibition of apoptotic signaling, preserved cytoskeletal architecture (especially stereocilia), and sustained mitochondrial function leading to improved Ca²⁺ clearance and mechanotransduction—each of which cumulatively would slow or arrest the progressive loss of hair cells that underpins ARHL (Fu et al., 2021; Chester et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation
In our comprehensive evaluation, TUDCA emerges as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss based on several converging lines of evidence. First, its natural origin as an endogenous bile acid conjugate and its longstanding clinical usage in liver disease provide a robust safety profile. This historical clinical use supports the feasibility of reallocation of TUDCA into a new therapeutic category with reduced developmental risk (Boatright et al., 2019).

Second, its therapeutic history spans multiple organ systems and disease models. TUDCA has demonstrated efficacy in reducing ER stress–mediated apoptosis in hepatocytes, neurons, and retinal cells. The underlying mechanisms—such as inhibition of CHOP induction, stabilization of ER Ca²⁺ levels, reduction of ROS production, and preservation of mitochondrial function—are all processes that are similarly compromised in aging cochlear hair cells (Boatright et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2016). Although there is no direct clinical data in ARHL, analogous preclinical models in retinal degeneration and genetic forms of deafness establish a foundation upon which TUDCA’s effects in the auditory system can be hypothesized (Chester et al., 2021).

Third, the mechanism of action of TUDCA is well characterized and ideally suited for addressing the cellular challenges encountered in ARHL. Its chemical chaperone activity helps alleviate the UPR burden by ensuring proper protein folding, while its capacity to maintain intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis mitigates the downstream effects of ER stress. In addition, by stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential and preserving the delicate balance between the ER and mitochondria, TUDCA prevents activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathways that lead to hair cell loss. This multifactorial protective action is supported by both biochemical assays and in vitro studies in cochlear explants, where TUDCA treatment preserves the structural integrity of stereocilia that is essential for proper mechanotransduction (Kusaczuk, 2019; Hu et al., 2016).

Fourth, the expected effect in the ARHL assay is clear: TUDCA is anticipated to reduce ER stress markers, inhibit pro-apoptotic signaling (as reflected by lowered caspase activation), and maintain the cytoskeletal architecture of hair cells. Preservation of stereocilia is particularly critical given that any alteration in their structure undermines the mechanotransduction machinery responsible for converting sound vibrations into an electrical signal (Hu et al., 2016). In parallel, improved mitochondrial function through sustained ATP production supports the operation of Ca²⁺-clearing pumps, thereby aiding the rapid repolarization necessary for hair cell function (Lamm et al., 2025).

Despite these compelling strengths, there remain several challenges. The most significant gap is the lack of direct in vivo evidence in ARHL models. While preclinical data in cochlear explants and genetic deafness models are encouraging, they do not fully recapitulate the complexity of human ARHL, which involves chronic, progressive changes over many years. Moreover, optimal dosing for the inner ear, particularly given the anatomical challenges such as the blood-labyrinth barrier, remains to be fully determined. Pharmacokinetic studies in the cochlear environment and targeted drug delivery strategies will be essential to translate the in vitro efficacy of TUDCA into successful in vivo applications (Shah et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2016).

Another consideration is the heterogeneity of ARHL itself. Age-related cochlear degeneration may be influenced by a host of factors beyond ER stress and apoptosis – for example, genetic predisposition, noise exposure history, metabolic dysregulation, and vascular changes. Although TUDCA’s broad-spectrum cytoprotective actions are a strength, they may not address every pathological facet of ARHL. Therefore, while TUDCA’s mechanism—centered on ER stress reduction, mitochondrial preservation, and anti-apoptotic signaling—provides a strong rationale, it may be most effective as part of a combinatorial therapeutic approach rather than as a monotherapy (Daruich et al., 2022; Gronbeck et al., 2016).

In summary, the convergent data from multiple domains suggest that TUDCA is a highly promising candidate for repurposing in Age-Related Hearing Loss. Its established clinical safety in liver disease, combined with robust preclinical evidence demonstrating neuroprotective and cytoprotective effects in retinal, neuronal, and cochlear models of degeneration, builds a compelling case for further investigation. Mechanistically, TUDCA’s ability to act as a chemical chaperone, stabilize ER Ca²⁺ homeostasis, facilitate mitochondrial-ER crosstalk, and reduce oxidative and apoptotic cues fits well with the known pathophysiological processes underlying the progressive loss of cochlear hair cells in ARHL. The anticipated effects—namely, reduced ER stress marker activation, preservation of stereocilia structure, and maintenance of efficient Ca²⁺ clearance—are well supported by available data, although additional in vivo studies and optimization of drug delivery remain necessary steps before clinical translation (Boatright et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2016; Kusaczuk, 2019).

Given these considerations, our recommendation is to pursue further preclinical evaluation of TUDCA in animal models of ARHL. Key studies should include detailed pharmacokinetic analyses in the inner ear, dose-response curves to ascertain the minimal effective concentration that yields hair cell protection, and evaluation of long-term outcomes on hearing function and stereocilia integrity. Parallel investigations into combinatorial strategies with other protective agents may also prove useful given the multifactorial nature of ARHL pathology. If successful, moving forward into clinical trial design for a repurposed indication in ARHL could offer a novel, mechanistically rational intervention for a common and debilitating age-related condition (Chester et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2020; Vang et al., 2014).

Overall, while certain translational challenges remain, TUDCA’s broad mechanistic profile, documented safety record, and preliminary evidence of efficacy in protecting sensory cell structures strongly support its candidacy as a therapeutic intervention for Age-Related Hearing Loss. Continued research and deliberate preclinical studies will be vital to ensure that the promising in vitro effects of TUDCA can be effectively harnessed to preserve auditory function in aging populations.
