Proposal for Capsazepine

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Capsazepine is a synthetic analogue derived from capsaicin, originally developed to inhibit the activity of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptor. As a member of the vanilloid receptor antagonists, capsazepine specifically belongs to a class of compounds designed to block capsaicin-induced activation of TRPV1 channels (Steyger, 2003; Yang et al., 2019). Its chemical synthesis capitalized on the known structure–activity relationships of capsaicin analogues, leading to a compound that competitively antagonizes TRPV1 while exhibiting a pharmacological profile that can also affect other ion channels under certain conditions (Yamamura et al., 2004). Historically, this class of compounds has been extensively used in pain research and neurophysiology studies, owing to their ability to modulate calcium (Ca²⁺) influx in sensory neurons and thereby inhibit neurogenic inflammation, a mechanism that has prompted interest in their application to other conditions characterized by pathological Ca²⁺ entry (Steyger, 2003).

Therapeutic History:
Capsazepine’s primary use to date has been in preclinical research models focusing on pain, inflammation, and ototoxicity. In the auditory system, for example, it has been widely employed as an experimental tool in inner ear preparations to block the effects of capsaicin and resiniferatoxin on cochlear TRPV1 channels, thereby modulating cochlear sensitivity (Steyger, 2003; Zheng et al., 2003). Studies using capsazepine in animal models have demonstrated its capacity to prevent capsaicin-mediated reductions in cochlear microphonic potentials and to normalize parameters such as evoked otoacoustic emissions by antagonizing TRPV1 activation in outer hair cells, which are critical for auditory amplification (Steyger, 2003; Zheng et al., 2003). More recently, TRPV1 antagonism has been proposed as a strategy to combat ototoxicity induced by drugs such as cisplatin, where excessive TRPV1 activation contributes to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell death; silencing TRPV1 with either capsazepine or siRNA has been shown to protect cochlear hair cells in these models (Mukherjea et al., 2008; Mukherjea et al., 2011). However, to date there are no registered clinical trials specifically evaluating capsazepine for the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) or similar auditory pathologies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This indicates that although the drug has a strong preclinical foundation in modulating TRPV1 signaling in the cochlea, its clinical application to ARHL remains to be fully explored.

Mechanism of Action:
Capsazepine acts as a competitive antagonist at the TRPV1 receptor, a nonselective cation channel that is highly permeable to Ca²⁺. Under physiological conditions, TRPV1 is activated by various stimuli, including capsaicin, heat, and acidic pH, leading to a rapid influx of Ca²⁺ into cells. In cochlear hair cells, which depend on tightly regulated Ca²⁺ signaling for mechanotransduction and the proper adaptation of the mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) channels, excessive Ca²⁺ entry through TRPV1 can disrupt cytosolic homeostasis. This dysregulation is thought to activate calcium-dependent proteases like calpain, ultimately contributing to cytoskeletal damage and impaired hair cell function (Ramkumar et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2003). At a molecular level, once capsazepine binds to TRPV1, it prevents the receptor from undergoing the conformational changes necessary for channel opening, effectively blocking the pathological Ca²⁺ influx during stress conditions. This antagonistic action has been well characterized in sensory neurons as well as in isolated cochlear tissue preparations (Steyger, 2003; Zheng et al., 2003). Furthermore, there is evidence that by inhibiting TRPV1, capsazepine may help preserve local phosphoinositide levels in the cell membrane, which is important because alterations in membrane phosphoinositides can affect the function of other mechanosensitive channels such as Piezo channels, potentially influencing mechanotransduction processes (Borbiro et al., 2015). Additional studies have shown that at concentrations as low as 5 μM, capsazepine is effective in blocking TRPV1 currents in sensory cells, thereby limiting excessive Ca²⁺ entry (Yang et al., 2019). While its primary mechanism of antagonism is through direct receptor blockade, off-target effects have been reported such as modulation of HCN channels (Gill et al., 2004) and activation of specific sodium channels under acidic conditions (Yamamura et al., 2004), but these effects are usually context dependent and may require careful titration in in vivo systems.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for the potential use of capsazepine in ARHL is that by inhibiting pathological TRPV1-mediated Ca²⁺ influx in aging hair cells, the drug will prevent Ca²⁺ overload that can compromise the adaptation and proper gating of MET channels. In mature cochlear hair cells, MET channels are crucial for converting mechanical stimuli into receptor potentials, and their function is exquisitely sensitive to intracellular Ca²⁺ levels. Excessive Ca²⁺ influx, as might occur when TRPV1 is hyperactivated by age-associated stressors such as oxidative damage or inflammatory mediators, can lead to sustained high intracellular Ca²⁺ levels that impair the rapid adaptation kinetics of MET channels (Ramkumar et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2003). By blocking these channels, capsazepine is expected to preserve normal Ca²⁺ homeostasis in hair cells, maintain appropriate cytoskeletal dynamics, and prevent the activation of calpain-mediated proteolysis, which has been implicated in age-related degradation of hair cell structure (Mukherjea et al., 2011). This preservation of Ca²⁺ signaling would theoretically support sustained mechanotransduction and, subsequently, better auditory function over time. Additionally, there is supporting evidence that TRPV1 is expressed in the organ of Corti—including outer hair cells (OHCs), inner hair cells (IHCs), and supporting cells—indicating the plausibility that its antagonism could directly influence the adaptive responses of these sensory cells (Zheng et al., 2003; Steyger, 2003). In inner ear models where TRPV1 antagonists have been used, the preservation of cochlear potentials and modulation of blood flow indirectly suggest a protective effect against ototoxic insults (Steyger, 2003; Zheng et al., 2003). Therefore, in the ARHL context, capsazepine is expected to act by maintaining hair cell integrity through the prevention of Ca²⁺ overload, thereby ensuring that MET channel adaptation kinetics remain within a range that supports proper mechanotransduction.

Overall Evaluation:
Capsazepine holds promise as a therapeutic candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss based on its well-characterized ability to block TRPV1-mediated Ca²⁺ influx. One of the major strengths of this candidate is the extensive preclinical evidence supporting the role of TRPV1 in mediating pathological Ca²⁺ entry that can lead to hair cell dysfunction in various models of cochlear injury, including those induced by cisplatin and possibly noise exposure (Mukherjea et al., 2008; Mukherjea et al., 2011). Capsazepine’s capacity to normalize electrophysiological parameters in the cochlea by antagonizing TRPV1 has been demonstrated through experiments involving changes in cochlear microphonics and otoacoustic emissions (Steyger, 2003; Zheng et al., 2003). In the context of ARHL, where cumulative oxidative stress and inflammatory processes lead to dysregulation of Ca²⁺ homeostasis, the proposed mechanism by which capsazepine preserves MET channel kinetics is both biologically plausible and supported by mechanistic studies showing TRPV1’s involvement in sensory transduction (Ramkumar et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2003).

The strengths of capsazepine include its high specificity as a TRPV1 antagonist, its established preclinical use in inner ear research, and its ability to acutely modulate Ca²⁺ influx at concentrations (approximately 5 μM) that are relevant in these experimental settings (Yang et al., 2019; Steyger, 2003). Its synthetic origin and historical use in pain models lend additional credibility to its potential repurposing for ARHL. Moreover, the mechanistic insights provided by studies on TRPV1’s gating properties and its regulation of phosphoinositide-dependent signaling pathways suggest that blocking TRPV1 may also indirectly preserve the functionality of mechanosensitive channels like Piezo, which could be beneficial for maintaining hair cell mechanotransduction (Borbiro et al., 2015).

However, there are also notable weaknesses and challenges. First, capsazepine has not been clinically validated for auditory indications, and no clinical trials have directly examined its efficacy in ARHL (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The translational leap from acute ototoxicity paradigms (for example, cisplatin-induced injury) to the chronic, multifactorial degeneration observed in ARHL remains a significant hurdle. Additionally, while the compound is effective in blocking TRPV1, its off-target effects on channels such as HCN and ENaC—as observed in some studies—raise concerns about potential unintended actions that could affect cochlear or systemic functions (Gill et al., 2004; Yamamura et al., 2004). Such off-target effects might prove problematic in a chronic treatment regimen aimed at elderly populations, who are often more susceptible to side effects. There is also the fact that ARHL is a complex, multifactorial condition, and while dysregulation of Ca²⁺ signaling is one component, other factors such as cumulative oxidative damage, vascular changes, and genetic predispositions play significant roles. Therefore, capsazepine’s effects might only address a subset of the pathological processes underlying ARHL.

Overall, the preclinical data support the hypothesis that TRPV1 contributes significantly to cochlear Ca²⁺ dysregulation and that its inhibition by capsazepine can mitigate deleterious Ca²⁺ overload in hair cells (Ramkumar et al., 2022; Steyger, 2003). This provides a strong mechanistic rationale for further investigation. The next logical steps would include comprehensive in vivo studies in aging animal models to assess long-term safety, optimal dosing, and efficacy of capsazepine in preserving hearing function. It will also be important to evaluate whether capsazepine can effectively maintain MET channel adaptation over time without disrupting normal cochlear physiology and whether any off-target effects can be minimized through formulation or dosing strategies.

In summary, while capsazepine has promising attributes as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss, significant further preclinical and eventually clinical studies are warranted to establish its efficacy and safety profile in this new indication. Its strengths lie in its well-defined mechanism of TRPV1 antagonism and its demonstrated protective effects in inner ear models, whereas its weaknesses include the lack of direct clinical evidence for ARHL, potential off-target effects, and the complex pathophysiology of ARHL that extend beyond Ca²⁺ dysregulation. Based on the current literature, capsazepine represents a scientifically sound candidate warranting additional investigation in models of aging-induced auditory degeneration (Mukherjea et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2003; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
