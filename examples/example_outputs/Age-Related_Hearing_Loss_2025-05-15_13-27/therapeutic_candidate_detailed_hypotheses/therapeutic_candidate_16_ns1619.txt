Proposal for NS1619

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
NS1619 is a synthetic benzimidazolone compound originally identified and characterized as a potent opener of large‐conductance calcium‐activated potassium (BK) channels (also called BKCa channels or KCa1.1), which are encoded by the KCNMA1 gene. Its chemical synthesis was performed via rational drug design approaches that aimed to produce molecules capable of increasing the open probability of BK channels, thereby hyperpolarizing cells and influencing cellular excitability. As a member of the synthetic BK channel opener class, NS1619 belongs to a group of compounds that have been widely employed in biomedical research to probe the function of BK channels not only in neuronal and vascular contexts but also in models of ischemia/reperfusion injury and other forms of cell stress. Its development and subsequent application in neuroprotection studies underscore its utility as a pharmacological tool to modulate ion channel function, and its structural and functional characteristics have served as a prototype for further chemical exploration in the field (Katakam, 2008, pp. 1–2; Shieh et al., 2003, pp. 8–9).

Therapeutic History:
NS1619 has been extensively used in preclinical investigations, particularly in the context of neuronal preconditioning and protection against ischemic injury. In several studies, NS1619 was shown to activate BK channels in various cell types, thereby modulating action potential firing and influencing intracellular calcium handling through membrane hyperpolarization. Early research in neuronal models demonstrated that administration of NS1619 could induce immediate or delayed neuroprotective effects by affecting mitochondrial function and attenuating excitotoxicity; these effects are believed to be mediated by its ability to trigger mild mitochondrial depolarization and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, ultimately engaging pro-survival signaling cascades (Gáspár et al., 2009, pp. 4–6; Katakam, 2008, pp. 1–2). Furthermore, in a recent study involving cochlear hair cells, peroxisome deficiency was found to reduce BK channel expression, a pathology that correlated with hearing loss in genetically modified mice; notably, pharmacological activation of BK channels using NS1619 (along with NS11021) restored auditory function in these models, thereby providing proof-of-concept evidence that BK channel activation may ameliorate sensorineural hearing deficits (Fu et al., 2023, pp. 9–11). However, systematic clinical data supporting NS1619’s use for Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) or presbycusis remain sparse, and most of the therapeutic experience with this compound is derived from acute neuronal or cardiac preconditioning studies rather than long-term interventions in auditory systems.

Mechanism of Action:
NS1619’s primary mechanism involves the pharmacological activation of BK channels. Under physiological conditions, BK channels couple membrane depolarization and intracellular calcium increases to produce a significant potassium efflux, which is critical for rapid repolarization and stabilization of the membrane potential. NS1619 increases the open probability of BK channels, thereby promoting K⁺ efflux and leading to cellular hyperpolarization. This hyperpolarization is expected to counteract prolonged depolarization events, thereby reducing the influx of Ca²⁺ through voltage-dependent calcium channels and mechanotransduction (MET) channels. At the molecular level, NS1619 binds to BK channels and facilitates a conformational change that favors channel opening without significantly altering single-channel conductance; rather, it augments both the mean open time and the frequency of channel activation (Shieh et al., 2003, pp. 8–9). In neuronal models, the protective effects of NS1619 have been partially attributed to its off-target effects such as mild mitochondrial depolarization and ROS generation, which may activate intracellular cascades involving the PI3K/Akt pathway and subsequently inhibit apoptosis via reduced caspase activation (Katakam, 2008, pp. 10–11). It is important to note, however, that while NS1619 is classically described as a BK channel opener, its precise molecular interactions in different tissues can vary, and some studies suggest that its effects on mitochondrial respiration and cellular energy balance may arise independently of direct BK channel activation.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for employing NS1619 in the treatment of ARHL is that by specifically increasing BK channel activity in cochlear hair cells, NS1619 will facilitate rapid repolarization of these cells following mechano‐electrical transduction events. In aged hair cells, impaired function of the plasma membrane Ca²⁺ ATPase (PMCA2) and prolonged opening of MET channels contribute to pathological intracellular Ca²⁺ accumulation, leading to cytotoxicity, excitotoxic damage, and defective adaptation kinetics in the sensory apparatus. By activating BK channels, NS1619 is anticipated to produce hyperpolarization that limits further Ca²⁺ influx during prolonged depolarizations, thereby restoring the rapid closure of MET channels and preserving the cell’s ability to adapt to continuous mechanical stimulation. This is particularly relevant in the aged cochlea where excitation–relaxation cycles are compromised, and maintaining appropriate ion channel function is critical for auditory signal fidelity. BK channels have been shown to contribute significantly to hair cell repolarization and efficient neurotransmitter release, and their reduced expression or dysfunction – as demonstrated in genetic or chemically-induced models – correlates with hearing deficits. Therefore, by restoring BK channel function with NS1619, one expects an improvement in auditory brainstem response outcomes and potentially a reduction in progressive hearing loss symptoms associated with age-dependent decline in ion channel function (Fu et al., 2023, pp. 9–11; Pinheiro et al., 2021, pp. 5–6).

Overall Evaluation:
NS1619 presents a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss based on its well-documented ability to activate BK channels, thereby facilitating cellular repolarization and mitigating Ca²⁺ overload – a key pathological mechanism implicated in hair cell degeneration in aging. One major strength of NS1619 is its established use as a research tool in various models of neuroprotection, which provides a substantial mechanistic rationale for its application to auditory system preservation. Evidence from peroxisome deficiency models in cochlear hair cells suggests that BK channel enhancement can restore auditory function, lending support to the underlying hypothesis that similar mechanisms of cellular protection may apply in ARHL (Fu et al., 2023, pp. 9–11). Additionally, the synthetic origin and precise molecular mechanism of NS1619 confer a well-defined structure–function relationship that can be further optimized for selectivity and potency in auditory tissues.

Nevertheless, there are notable weaknesses that must be addressed. NS1619 has been reported to exhibit off-target effects, including alterations in mitochondrial function and inhibition of L-type Ca²⁺ channels at higher concentrations, which may limit its therapeutic index (Van et al., 2024, pp. 27–28; Gáspár et al., 2009, pp. 4–6). These nonselective actions may lead to unintended consequences in long-term administration, especially in a clinical setting where chronic treatment is required for ARHL. Moreover, while there is promising preclinical evidence in certain models of hearing loss, there is a lack of direct clinical trial data or extensive in vivo studies specifically addressing NS1619’s efficacy in age-related auditory decline. The compound’s pharmacokinetic profile, tissue-specific permeability (including inner ear barriers), and potential systemic effects require thorough investigation before advancing into later stages of drug development. Another consideration is that age-related hearing loss is multifactorial in nature; while targeting BK channels may alleviate some aspects of the pathophysiology, other contributing factors such as synaptopathy, oxidative damage, and changes in cochlear homeostasis may not be fully addressed by BK channel modulation alone (Bazard et al., 2021, pp. 13–15; Pinheiro et al., 2021, pp. 8–9).

In summary, NS1619 is a well-characterized synthetic BK channel opener with a substantial body of preclinical evidence supporting its role in modulating cellular excitability and providing neuroprotection through enhanced potassium efflux and membrane repolarization. Its ability to potentially restore the rapid adaptation kinetics of MET channels in aged cochlear hair cells by reducing intracellular Ca²⁺ overload is consistent with the mechanistic needs dictated by ARHL pathology. However, challenges such as off-target effects, limited direct evidence in ARHL models, and the need for robust pharmacokinetic and safety profiles present significant hurdles. Given these factors, NS1619 merits further investigation in well-controlled preclinical studies specifically designed to assess its impact on cochlear hair cell function and long-term auditory outcomes in age-related hearing loss (Katakam, 2008, pp. 11–12; Van et al., 2024, pp. 10–11; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
