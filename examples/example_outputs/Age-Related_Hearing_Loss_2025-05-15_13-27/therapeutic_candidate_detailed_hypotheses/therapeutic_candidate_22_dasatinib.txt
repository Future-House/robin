Proposal for Dasatinib

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dasatinib, marketed under the name Sprycel®, is a second‐generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) originally developed for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome‐positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Derived synthetically by medicinal chemistry methods and formulated based on structure–activity relationships observed in earlier TKIs, dasatinib was designed to inhibit BCR‐ABL and several other tyrosine kinases including members of the Src family, c-kit, EPHA2, and PDGF receptors (Rivera-Torres & San José, 2019). Dasatinib belongs to a class of small-molecule compounds that exert their effects by binding to the ATP-binding pockets of target kinases, thereby blocking phosphorylation events that are critical for the signaling pathways driving cellular proliferation and survival. In recent years, beyond its established use as an anticancer agent, dasatinib has been repurposed due to its senolytic properties—that is, its ability to selectively induce apoptosis in senescent cells by targeting the anti-apoptotic pathways (Hickson et al., 2019; Islam et al., 2023). The rationale for its repurposing in age-related diseases such as Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) is based on the emerging understanding that senescent cells accumulate in various organs with aging and contribute to tissue degeneration via their senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Dasatinib’s chemical structure and kinase inhibition profile position it as a promising candidate to remove these deleterious cell populations and restore tissue homeostasis (Kirkland & Tchkonia, 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Dasatinib has a well-established history in the oncology field and has been evaluated and used in clinical practice for the treatment of CML and ALL due to its potent inhibition of BCR-ABL and multiple other kinases that drive malignant cellular proliferation. Clinical trials and post-marketing studies have documented its efficacy in reducing leukemic cell burden, while also outlining its side effect profile which includes myelosuppression, pleural effusions, and occasionally pulmonary arterial hypertension (Rivera-Torres & San José, 2019). Over the past several years, attention has turned to the possibility of repurposing dasatinib for non-oncologic conditions, particularly those associated with aging. Preclinical studies in rodent models have demonstrated that dasatinib, particularly when combined with natural polyphenols like quercetin, can effectively clear senescent cells from multiple tissues (Ege et al., 2024; Meiners et al., 2024). For instance, in aged mice, administration of dasatinib at doses as low as 5 mg/kg has been observed to decrease the expression of senescence markers in several tissues including adipose tissue and muscle, suggesting a role in prolonging healthspan (Ege et al., 2024). Although its use specifically for Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) has not yet reached the level of clinical trials—as confirmed by our Clinical Trial Search: Dasatinib AND (hearing loss OR cochlea OR age-related hearing loss OR presbycusis)—the mechanistic rationale and preclinical evidence in other age-related conditions provide a strong basis for exploring its application in the auditory field (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ege et al., 2024). Additionally, related research in cellular senescence and therapeutic interventions targeting the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) further supports investigating dasatinib’s ability to mitigate chronic inflammation in age-associated diseases (Bermúdez & Varela-Nieto, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
Dasatinib exerts its biological activity through a multi-targeted inhibition of tyrosine kinases, which include BCR-ABL, Src family kinases, c-kit, and PDGF receptors. The compound binds competitively to the ATP-binding site of these kinases, thereby blocking downstream phosphorylation events critical for survival and proliferation signals in both cancer and, importantly for our interest, senescent cells (Rivera-Torres & San José, 2019). Senescent cells are characterized by their resistance to apoptosis, largely due to the upregulation of anti-apoptotic pathways, often referred to as senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways (SCAPs). Dasatinib disrupts these pathways by inhibiting kinases that drive prosurvival signals. For example, dasatinib interferes with Src-mediated signaling, which not only is essential for oncogenic survival but also plays a role in maintaining the viability of senescent cells that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines (Hickson et al., 2019; Konstantinou et al., 2024). Moreover, the combination of dasatinib with quercetin has been shown to produce a synergistic senolytic effect, where quercetin acts to target additional survival signals—by inhibiting kinases such as PI3K/AKT and downregulating members of the BCL-2 family—thereby facilitating the apoptotic clearance of senescent cells (Rattanaprukskul et al., 2025; Hickson et al., 2019). In aged tissues, senescent cells secrete a complex array of inflammatory proteins, growth factors, and proteases (collectively known as SASP), which contribute to local tissue degeneration, chronic inflammation, and impaired cellular function (Ege et al., 2024; Bermúdez & Varela-Nieto, 2021). By selectively inducing apoptosis in these cells, dasatinib can reduce the burden of SASP factors, thereby lowering levels of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that are known to disrupt the normal function of mechanotransduction channels in cochlear hair cells (Ege et al., 2024; Hayashi et al., 2023). The intricate interplay between senescence, inflammation, and degeneration in several tissues supports the biochemical hypothesis that dasatinib’s inhibition of kinase signaling can lead to downstream improvements in tissue homeostasis via reduced oxidative stress and restoration of regenerative capacities (Ege et al., 2024; Hickson et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
According to our hypothesis, dasatinib is expected to exert a protective effect on the aging cochlea by selectively eliminating senescent cells within both the hair cell populations and the supporting cellular elements. The accumulation of senescent cells in the cochlea has been implicated in the elevation of local SASP factors, which include pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6), matrix-degrading enzymes (MMPs), and other factors that can directly compromise the mechanotransduction (MET) channels in hair cells (Ege et al., 2024). By clearing these cells, dasatinib should reduce the chronic inflammatory milieu, restore redox homeostasis, and lower the oxidative burden—a scenario supported by preclinical studies in other tissues where senolytic treatment resulted in improved tissue function and decreased inflammation (Ege et al., 2024; Hickson et al., 2019). Specifically, the expected outcome in our assay is that dasatinib, possibly administered alone at an optimized dose (prior studies in mice have used around 5 mg/kg), will lead to a decrease in markers of senescence such as p16^INK4a and p21^CIP1, as well as a concomitant reduction in SASP factor levels. This reduction, in turn, should create a pro-homeostatic microenvironment in the cochlea where surviving hair cells maintain robust mechanotransduction capabilities, reflected in improved auditory function and preservation of hair cell integrity (Ege et al., 2024). Furthermore, known expression profiles indicate that elements of the anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory pathways targeted by dasatinib are indeed active in cochlear cells, including those essential for hair cell function and survival (Ege et al., 2024; Hayashi et al., 2023). By lowering the levels of SASP-related cytokines, dasatinib is anticipated to also reduce secondary inflammatory cascades and oxidative stress, further mitigating damage to the mechanosensory structures of the inner ear (Ege et al., 2024; Hickson et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, dasatinib is a compelling candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss due to its well-characterized senolytic activity and ability to modulate pro-survival and inflammatory pathways. One major strength of dasatinib lies in its broad-spectrum inhibition of tyrosine kinases—particularly those involved in maintaining the survival of senescent cells. Preclinical data in various tissues have demonstrated that intermittent dosing regimens of dasatinib (often in combination with quercetin) can effectively reduce senescent cell burdens and lower SASP factor levels, leading to overall improvements in tissue function and reduced chronic inflammation (Hickson et al., 2019; Ege et al., 2024). Given the role of senescence and SASP in damaging the hair cells and supporting structures in the cochlea, these findings lend robust mechanistic credibility to the hypothesis that dasatinib could help preserve mechanotransduction by lowering local inflammatory insults (Ege et al., 2024). Additionally, previous dosing studies in rodent models have shown that even at relatively low doses, dasatinib can induce significant clearance of senescent cells without undue toxicity, which is promising for translational applications in ARHL (Ege et al., 2024; Godoy et al., 2024).

However, there are also potential weaknesses and risks to consider. Dasatinib’s primary indication in oncology means that its safety profile has been established in cancer patients rather than in a population with a degenerative, non-malignant condition like ARHL. Its adverse effects—such as myelosuppression, pleural effusions, and potential cardiovascular complications—necessitate careful consideration when repurposing it for a chronic, age-related application (Rivera-Torres & San José, 2019). Furthermore, while the senolytic clearance of cells has been shown to provide systemic benefits, there is currently no direct clinical trial evidence demonstrating that dasatinib can reverse or halt cochlear degeneration. The absence of any registered clinical trials specifically addressing hearing loss with dasatinib signals that significant preclinical work in auditory models is required before clinical translation can be considered (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ege et al., 2024). Moreover, while combining dasatinib with quercetin has often produced synergistic effects in preclinical models, it remains to be fully established whether dasatinib alone can achieve the desired cochlear effects or whether a combinatorial approach will be necessary (Ege et al., 2024; Rattanaprukskul et al., 2025).

Biochemically, the mechanism by which dasatinib is expected to work in the cochlea is well supported by evidence from other tissues—its capacity to disable kinase pathways involved in the anti-apoptotic protection of senescent cells, reduce SASP-related inflammatory cytokines, and thus lower chronic inflammation and oxidative stress (Konstantinou et al., 2024; Hickson et al., 2019). These biochemical effects are anticipated to create an environment conducive to hair cell survival, potentially preserving mechanotransduction functionality by mitigating inflammation-induced MET channel dysfunction (Ege et al., 2024). In addition, the broader literature on cellular senescence supports the idea that removal of senescent cells can restore tissue homeostasis, improve regenerative capacities, and reduce the cascading effects of inflammatory mediators, all of which are critical for maintaining cochlear integrity in aging (Ege et al., 2024; Hayashi et al., 2023).

Overall, dasatinib represents a strong candidate for further investigation in the context of ARHL based on its established senolytic properties, its proven ability to reduce systemic and tissue-specific inflammatory markers, and the mechanistic rationale that links chronic inflammation and cellular senescence to cochlear hair cell degeneration (Ege et al., 2024; Meiners et al., 2024). The strengths include its well-known pharmacological profile in oncology, significant preclinical efficacy in reducing senescent cell burden (as demonstrated by reductions in p16^INK4a and p21^CIP1), and evidence from several studies indicating that the clearance of senescent cells can ameliorate age-related tissue dysfunction (Hickson et al., 2019; Ege et al., 2024). Key challenges remain in adapting an anti-cancer agent for chronic use in an elderly population with ARHL, ensuring safety at potentially lower doses over extended periods, and establishing direct preclinical efficacy in auditory models. Further studies—both in vitro using cochlear cell cultures and in vivo using animal models that closely mimic the human aging cochlea—are imperative to validate whether dasatinib can indeed lower SASP-driven inflammation and protect surviving hair cells to maintain mechanotransduction (Ege et al., 2024; Godoy et al., 2024; Hickson et al., 2019).

In conclusion, the preclinical mechanistic evidence supports dasatinib’s potential role in targeting senescent cells for Age-Related Hearing Loss by reducing the secretion of inflammatory SASP factors and thereby protecting hair cell function. Its established clinical use in oncology provides a detailed understanding of its pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, although this same profile poses challenges for chronic use in non-malignant conditions. The absence of direct clinical studies in ARHL highlights the need for further targeted animal and cell-based studies to rigorously evaluate its efficacy and safety in the auditory system. Given the available evidence from various sources (Ege et al., 2024; Hickson et al., 2019; Konstantinou et al., 2024), dasatinib’s repurposing warrants further investigation with a strategic research plan encompassing detailed preclinical auditory models, potential combinatorial use with senomorphic compounds such as quercetin, and careful dose optimization to maximize benefit while minimizing systemic adverse effects. Overall, dasatinib is a promising therapeutic candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss that, if its senolytic and anti-inflammatory properties can be successfully harnessed in the cochlea, may help preserve hair cell mechanotransduction and slow the progression of ARHL.
