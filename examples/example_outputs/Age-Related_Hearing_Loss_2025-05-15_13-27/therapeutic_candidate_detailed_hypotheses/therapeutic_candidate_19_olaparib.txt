Proposal for Olaparib

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Olaparib (Lynparza®) is a synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor of poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) discovered during the development of targeted oncology therapies. It belongs to the class of PARP inhibitors, which are designed to bind competitively at the NAD⁺ catalytic site of PARP1 and PARP2. Olaparib was originally synthesized to exploit the concept of synthetic lethality in BRCA-mutated cancers by preventing PARylation, thereby impeding single-strand DNA break repair and leading to the accumulation of double-strand breaks in cells deficient in homologous recombination repair. Its chemical structure was developed based on structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies, and it has been extensively characterized in preclinical studies before being approved for clinical oncology applications (Bochum et al., 2018). In the broader context, PARP inhibitors have been used predominantly in oncology; however, their mechanism of action—namely, interfering with the cellular response to DNA damage by preventing NAD⁺ consumption through PARylation—opens up the possibility for repurposing in diseases where excessive PARP1 activation leads to NAD⁺ depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction. In our proposed strategy, Olaparib is hypothesized to prevent age-related NAD⁺ depletion in cochlear hair cells, thereby preserving the activity of NAD⁺-dependent sirtuins that are essential for mitochondrial maintenance and resistance to oxidative stress (Ege et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Olaparib has garnered extensive clinical experience as a therapeutic agent in oncology. It has been approved for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer and has demonstrated efficacy in other BRCA-mutated malignancies. Phase I trials, such as the one reported in the final report of a phase I study combining Olaparib with cetuximab and radiation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, have highlighted its safety profile and pharmacokinetic properties in a patient population with advanced disease (Karam et al., 2018). Despite its widespread use in oncology, there are no clinical studies or veterinary reports to date that have evaluated its efficacy for hearing loss, including age-related hearing loss or cochlear dysfunction. Indeed, a search of ClinicalTrials.gov under “Olaparib AND (hearing loss OR cochlear OR age-related hearing loss OR presbycusis)” revealed no current investigations directly targeting these auditory conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nonetheless, preclinical evidence and the emerging conceptual framework regarding the role of PARP1 activation in cellular aging suggest that its mechanism might be translated to conditions beyond cancer, including the degenerative processes observed in the aging cochlea (Ege et al., 2024; Okur et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Olaparib functions by binding to the catalytic domain of PARP1. PARP1 is normally activated in response to DNA damage—especially single-strand breaks—and catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose units from NAD⁺ onto various acceptor proteins via a process called poly-ADP ribosylation (PARylation). By competitively binding to the NAD⁺ binding site, Olaparib inhibits PARP1’s enzymatic activity, thereby preventing the assembly of PAR chains on target proteins. This mechanism effectively blocks the recruitment of DNA repair proteins to sites of damage. In the context of aging cochlear cells, excessive activation of PARP1 (as can be triggered by cumulative oxidative DNA damage) may lead to significant depletion of intracellular NAD⁺ pools. NAD⁺ is an essential cofactor for various metabolic processes, most notably for the activity of sirtuins such as SIRT1 and SIRT3, which are NAD⁺-dependent deacetylases critically involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) management, and autophagy regulation (Ege et al., 2024; Song et al., 2016). Inhibition of PARP1 by Olaparib is proposed to prevent this NAD⁺ depletion, thereby facilitating the maintenance of sirtuin activity. This, in turn, supports mitochondrial respiratory function and ATP production—which are vital for mechanotransduction in cochlear hair cells—and reduces the onset of PARP1-mediated cell death pathways, such as parthanatos. Additionally, this inhibition may lower oxidative stress and improve mitochondrial dynamics through indirect preservation of the NAD⁺ pool (Bochum et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed application for age-related hearing loss, it is anticipated that Olaparib will exert multiple beneficial effects on cochlear physiology. First, by inhibiting PARP1, Olaparib will reduce the rate of NAD⁺ consumption in response to age- and ROS-induced DNA damage in cochlear hair cells, thereby preserving intracellular NAD⁺ levels. This preservation is expected to maintain the activity of key sirtuins (notably SIRT1 and SIRT3), both of which have been demonstrated to play protective roles in auditory tissues by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, reducing oxidative damage, and promoting autophagic clearance of damaged organelles (Ege et al., 2024; Pang et al., 2019). Maintenance of ATP production via improved mitochondrial respiration is vital for supporting the energetically demanding mechanotransduction process in hair cells, particularly in high-frequency regions of the cochlea where energy demands are high. Moreover, by preventing the formation of excessive PAR polymers, as observed in preclinical studies where Olaparib reduced PAR polymer formation at doses around 50 mg/kg/day in rodents, the drug could potentially mitigate cell death triggered by the cascade of events following PARP1 overactivation (Ege et al., 2024). This improved cellular environment is hypothesized to ultimately preserve the structural and functional integrity of cochlear hair cells, thereby slowing or preventing the progression of age-related hearing loss. Importantly, sirtuin activity (and specifically the expression of SIRT1 and SIRT3) has been documented in auditory tissues, highlighting the relevance of the NAD⁺-sirtuin axis in cochlear health (Ege et al., 2024; Han et al., 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
Our comprehensive review suggests that Olaparib is a promising candidate for repurposing in the context of age-related hearing loss. One of its major strengths lies in its robust and well-characterized mechanism of action in inhibiting PARP1, which is central to the prevention of NAD⁺ depletion in cells exposed to cumulative oxidative stress—a common feature in aging tissues, including the cochlea (Ege et al., 2024; Song et al., 2016). The established safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of Olaparib from its extensive use in oncology also add to its appeal for repurposing, as this reduces the uncertainty regarding toxicity and systemic effects when considering translational applications (Bochum et al., 2018; Karam et al., 2018).

However, several weaknesses and challenges must be noted. To date, there is no preclinical or clinical data directly assessing the efficacy of Olaparib in preserving cochlear structure or function in hearing loss models. The extrapolation from oncology to auditory protection is mechanistically appealing but remains speculative until validated in dedicated animal models of cochlear aging. In particular, the expression and activity profiles of PARP1 and related NAD⁺-dependent enzymes in cochlear hair cells have been characterized in the context of aging (Ege et al., 2024), but direct studies measuring the impact of PARP1 inhibition in these tissues are lacking. Moreover, dosing regimens effective in cancer treatment might not translate directly to the nuanced requirements of long-term therapy for age-related hearing loss, where chronic, low-dose intervention may be necessary to prevent gradual cellular decline (Okur et al., 2023).

It is also important to consider that while Olaparib’s effects on NAD⁺ conservation and sirtuin activation have been demonstrated in models showing improved mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress (Brown et al., 2014; Ege et al., 2024), the auditory cell environment may exhibit unique pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties that influence drug distribution, retention, and efficacy. Approaches such as localized delivery to the cochlea or formulation modifications may be necessary to achieve optimal therapeutic concentrations without systemic side effects.

In terms of expected cellular outcomes, preserving NAD⁺ levels and supporting sirtuin-mediated mitochondrial repair are both promising mechanisms for forestalling the degenerative cascade in cochlear hair cells. The maintenance of mitochondrial health is essential not only for energy production but also for managing reactive oxygen species and ensuring effective cellular repair mechanisms. The proposed effect of Olaparib in maintaining mechanotransduction capacity via sustained ATP production and improved mitochondrial respiration is highly relevant given that auditory transduction is an energy-intensive process (Ege et al., 2024; Pang et al., 2019). Therefore, preventing cell death through inhibition of PARP1-mediated pathways such as parthanatos could maintain functional hair cell populations and, by extension, preserve hearing.

Overall, the strengths of Olaparib for the treatment of age-related hearing loss lie in its clearly defined molecular target (PARP1), the established link between PARP1 activity and NAD⁺ depletion in aging cells, and supportive evidence from related studies demonstrating that preservation of NAD⁺ levels can enhance sirtuin function and mitochondrial integrity (Ege et al., 2024; Pang et al., 2019). Conversely, the weaknesses are centered on the lack of direct preclinical auditory data, uncertainties related to chronic dosing in non-cancer populations, and the potential challenge of achieving effective drug delivery in cochlear tissues.

In conclusion, while Olaparib is a well-established PARP1 inhibitor with documented efficacy in oncology, its mechanism of preserving NAD⁺ pools and supporting sirtuin activity provides a compelling rationale for investigation in age-related hearing loss. The current literature supports the notion that excessive PARP1 activation contributes to cochlear cell aging via NAD⁺ depletion, and thus targeting this pathway could ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction, reduce oxidative stress, and preserve the mechanotransductive machinery of hair cells (Ege et al., 2024; Han et al., 2016; Okur et al., 2023). However, critical gaps in direct auditory research remain, necessitating comprehensive preclinical validation in relevant animal models. Future studies should focus on determining the optimal dose for cochlear protection, evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy profiles in auditory tissues, and assessing whether localized drug delivery methods can maximize cochlear uptake while minimizing systemic exposure. Given these considerations, Olaparib represents a promising candidate that warrants further investigation as a repurposed therapeutic agent to prevent or slow the progression of age-related hearing loss (Ege et al., 2024; Okur et al., 2023).
