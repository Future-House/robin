Nicotinamide Riboside,"Proposal for Nicotinamide Riboside

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a naturally occurring derivative of vitamin B3 that was initially discovered during studies of NAD⁺ metabolism and nicotinamide salvage pathways. Found in trace amounts in naturally occurring sources such as milk, yeast, and certain vegetables, NR has been isolated and subsequently synthesized using biochemical extraction techniques and chemo‐enzymatic methods that yield high‐purity products suitable for both preclinical studies and clinical use (Alegre & Pastore, 2023). As a member of the nutraceutical and dietary supplement class of compounds, NR is specifically designed to boost intracellular levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺)—a critical coenzyme involved in cellular energy metabolism, glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as in maintaining redox homeostasis (Alegre & Pastore, 2023). Unlike other NAD⁺ precursors that rely on the Preiss–Handler pathway, NR is metabolized primarily via a dedicated pathway involving nicotinamide riboside kinases (NRK1 and NRK2), which convert it into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and subsequently into NAD⁺ (Alegre & Pastore, 2023). This unique metabolic route has increased interest in NR as a repurposed drug candidate, especially because it exhibits a high degree of oral bioavailability in both animal models and humans, making it an attractive candidate for chronic administration in conditions associated with NAD⁺ decline, such as Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) (Alegre & Pastore, 2023; Sharma et al., 2022). In the current context of drug development for ARHL, NR is being explored as a means to replenish NAD⁺ pools in cochlear hair cells, thereby mitigating age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage that are thought to contribute to auditory decline.

Therapeutic History:
Over the past decade, extensive biochemical, preclinical, and emerging clinical investigations have focused on the therapeutic potential of NR across a range of conditions in which NAD⁺ depletion plays a central role. Preclinical studies in animal models have demonstrated that NR supplementation can counteract high-fat diet-induced obesity, improve glucose homeostasis, enhance lipid metabolism, and stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis; these outcomes are particularly important in the context of aging, where decreased mitochondrial function and reduced NAD⁺ levels contribute to metabolic decline (Sharma et al., 2022; Biswas & Biotechnology Kiosk, 2020). In rodent models, increased NAD⁺ availability through NR supplementation has been linked to improvements in muscle function and overall energy metabolism, thereby extending lifespan and enhancing healthspan. Clinical studies in healthy human subjects have further established that NR is well tolerated, with doses up to 1 gram per day leading to significant increases in blood NAD⁺ levels and favorable changes in transcriptomic profiles that suggest reduced systemic inflammation (Airhart et al., 2017; Nakagawa-Nagahama et al., 2023). Although most clinical trials with NR have focused on metabolic and neurodegenerative endpoints, preclinical studies specifically examining ARHL have shown promising evidence. In aged murine models, NR supplementation has been observed to elevate cochlear NAD⁺ levels, improve auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds, and reduce synaptic degeneration in cochlear hair cells (Okur et al., 2023; Ege et al., 2024). Despite the absence of dedicated human trials in ARHL (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), the robust body of preclinical data in related neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders provides a solid scientific basis for pursuing NR as a treatment for age-related auditory decline.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, nicotinamide riboside serves as a direct precursor for the biosynthesis of NAD⁺. Once administered orally, NR is absorbed by target cells and phosphorylated by nicotinamide riboside kinases NKR1 and NKR2, yielding nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NMN is then enzymatically converted into NAD⁺ via nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) (Alegre & Pastore, 2023). This surge in intracellular NAD⁺ concentrations plays a pivotal role in activating NAD⁺-dependent enzymes, particularly the sirtuin family of deacetylases, with SIRT1 and SIRT3 being of major interest in the context of aging and mitochondrial quality control (Lloret & Beal, 2019).

SIRT1, which primarily resides in the nucleus, deacetylates target proteins such as PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. The deacetylation process enhances PGC-1α activity, leading to the transcription of genes that drive mitochondrial replication, repair, and efficient energy production. Meanwhile, SIRT3, localized to the mitochondria itself, deacetylates key metabolic enzymes that are central to preserving mitochondrial membrane potential and reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Ege et al., 2024; Lloret & Beal, 2019). Given that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are critical contributors to hair cell degeneration in ARHL, the activation of these sirtuin pathways by NR is expected to restore mitochondrial integrity, improve redox balance, and enhance cellular repair mechanisms in the cochlea.

In addition to its effects on sirtuin activation, NR has been shown to influence metabolic pathways associated with lipid handling in cochlear cells. Recent studies indicate that NR modulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathways, leading to further upregulation of lipid droplet-associated proteins such as CIDEC and PLIN1 (Ege et al., 2024; Okur et al., 2023). This regulation of lipid metabolism may serve to create an additional energy reservoir within cells and protect against lipid peroxidation—a process that can exacerbate oxidative damage in metabolically active tissues like the cochlea.

While direct modulation of mechanotransduction (MET) channel proteins such as TMC1 and TMC2 by NR has not been definitively demonstrated, the general improvement in mitochondrial quality and the reduction of oxidative stress through NR-induced NAD⁺ replenishment may indirectly stabilize these critical channels. As mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS accumulation have been implicated in the disruption of MET channel function, NR's potential to restore the bioenergetic profile of cochlear hair cells through sirtuin-mediated deacetylation and improved lipid metabolism represents a compelling rationale for its use in ARHL (Ege et al., 2024; Sharma et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the repurposing of nicotinamide riboside for Age-Related Hearing Loss is that NR supplementation will restore and maintain sufficient intracellular NAD⁺ levels in cochlear hair cells, thereby reactivating critical sirtuin pathways and improving mitochondrial performance. In the proposed treatment model, NR is expected to boost NAD⁺ levels in aged cochlear cells, resulting in enhanced deacetylation of PGC-1α by SIRT1 and SIRT3 activation within the mitochondria. This cascade of molecular events is predicted to promote mitochondrial biogenesis, improve ATP production, and reduce oxidative stress through more efficient scavenging of ROS. In turn, these effects should provide a more stable cellular environment that can sustain the energy-dependent processes critical for mechanotransduction.

In preclinical murine models, administration of NR at doses approximating 500 mg/kg/day has been shown to elevate cochlear NAD⁺ levels significantly. This biochemical restoration correlates with improved auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds, as evidenced by increased amplitudes in Wave I and Wave III, which reflect cochlear and auditory nerve function, respectively (Okur et al., 2023). The maintenance of synaptic ribbon counts in the inner hair cells—which serve as key anatomical markers for synaptic integrity—is another expected outcome of NR treatment that supports the notion of restored communication between hair cells and auditory neurons.

Moreover, the activation of PPAR signaling pathways by NR may enhance the expression of lipid droplet-associated proteins like CIDEC and PLIN1. These proteins are implicated in the regulation of cellular energy storage and metabolism, providing an additional layer of protection against the oxidative challenges that occur in aging cochlear cells (Ege et al., 2024; Biswas & Biotechnology Kiosk, 2020). Although direct assessments of MET channel proteins (TMC1 and TMC2) remain to be fully elucidated, the preservation of mitochondrial function and reduction in ROS are crucial for the proper functioning of these channels, thereby potentially maintaining normal mechanotransduction and auditory perception (Okur et al., 2023; Ege et al., 2024).

Furthermore, NR’s influence on reducing hair cell apoptosis could contribute to an overall preservation of cochlear structure and function. By mitigating the processes that lead to synaptic loss and neuronal degradation, NR is anticipated not only to halt further auditory decline but also, to some extent, reverse some aspects of the damage incurred during aging. The cumulative effect of these cellular and biochemical improvements would be measured by advanced electrophysiological techniques such as ABR testing, coupled with histological assessments showing reduced synaptic ribbon loss and lower incidence of hair cell death (Okur et al., 2023; Ege et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
The current literature provides a robust scientific rationale for repurposing nicotinamide riboside as a therapeutic candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss. One of the strongest aspects of NR is its natural derivation from vitamin B3 and its efficient, well-characterized synthesis and purification routes, which facilitate its use as an orally bioavailable nutraceutical. The compound’s reputation for safety and tolerability in both preclinical and early-phase clinical studies further supports its translational potential (Alegre & Pastore, 2023; Sharma et al., 2022).

Mechanistically, the ability of NR to restore NAD⁺ levels and thereby enhance the activity of NAD⁺-dependent sirtuins such as SIRT1 and SIRT3 is particularly attractive in the context of ARHL. These sirtuin pathways are well established as mediators of mitochondrial quality control, with SIRT1 promoting the deacetylation and activation of PGC-1α to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and SIRT3 directly safeguarding mitochondrial enzymes against oxidative damage (Lloret & Beal, 2019; Ege et al., 2024). Given that the pathophysiology of ARHL involves mitochondrial dysfunction, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and subsequent impairment of energy-dependent processes in cochlear hair cells, targeting these pathways is a logical approach.

Preclinical studies have already demonstrated that NR supplementation can partially restore cochlear NAD⁺ levels in aged mice, with corresponding improvements in auditory function as measured by ABR thresholds and preservation of synaptic structures (Okur et al., 2023). These findings suggest that NR has a multidimensional mode of action that addresses several critical mechanisms implicated in cochlear aging, including metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. The indirect benefits that may accrue to MET channel proteins such as TMC1 and TMC2 via enhanced mitochondrial quality and decreased ROS further underscore the potential for NR to restore mechanotransduction in aged ears (Ege et al., 2024; Biswas & Biotechnology Kiosk, 2020).

From a therapeutic history standpoint, although NR has not yet been evaluated in dedicated clinical trials for ARHL, its extensive study in metabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular conditions establishes a well-documented safety profile and efficacy in improving cellular bioenergetics. The absence of human clinical data specifically for ARHL constitutes a notable gap, but the encouraging preclinical data and the overlap in the underlying molecular mechanisms provide a compelling rationale for further investigation. Future clinical trials targeting auditory outcomes in elderly patients will be essential to validate the findings from animal models and to optimize dosing regimens that translate the murine benefits into human therapeutics (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

One potential challenge in the clinical translation of NR for ARHL lies in the variability of dosing strategies observed in preclinical models. In mice, doses around 500 mg/kg/day have shown promising results; however, careful pharmacokinetic and dose-escalation studies will be necessary to ensure similar efficacy and safety in humans over long-term administration. Furthermore, while the activation of sirtuins and the subsequent downstream effects on mitochondrial function are well supported, the direct mechanistic links to the stabilization or upregulation of MET channel proteins, including TMC1 and TMC2, remain inferential at present. This represents an area where additional targeted research is warranted to elucidate the precise molecular interactions involved.

In summary, the strengths of nicotinamide riboside as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss are considerable. Its natural origin, efficient synthesis, proven oral bioavailability, and extensively characterized mechanism of action—which includes the restoration of NAD⁺ levels leading to sirtuin activation, improved mitochondrial biogenesis, and reduced oxidative stress—provide a sound scientific basis for its application in ARHL (Alegre & Pastore, 2023; Ege et al., 2024). Preclinical evidence from murine models indicating improved auditory function and preservation of synaptic integrity offers further support to the concept that NR may be capable of not only halting further auditory decline but also potentially reversing some aspects of cochlear degeneration (Okur et al., 2023).

However, notable weaknesses include the current lack of direct clinical evidence in human ARHL, the need for further clarification of NR’s direct effects on mechanotransduction channel proteins, and uncertainties related to optimal dosing regimens for long-term administration in elderly populations. Addressing these gaps through dedicated clinical studies will be essential to advance NR from a promising candidate in preclinical research to a validated therapy for ARHL.

Overall, the convergence of metabolic, mitochondrial, and oxidative stress pathways in the pathogenesis of ARHL creates a unique opportunity for NR to be repurposed as a therapeutic intervention in this domain. The extensive preclinical data, combined with a favorable safety profile documented in human studies addressing related conditions, makes a compelling argument for further investment in research on NR in the context of age-related auditory decline. Future studies should incorporate rigorous assessments of auditory function, molecular markers for sirtuin activity, mitochondrial quality, and direct analyses of MET channel integrity to fully delineate the therapeutic benefits and mechanisms of NR in ARHL. The evidence to date suggests that NR not only holds promise for preserving auditory function but may also offer broader benefits in terms of overall cellular health and longevity, making it a strong candidate for inclusion in the drug development pipeline targeting Age-Related Hearing Loss (Alegre & Pastore, 2023; Ege et al., 2024; Okur et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2022).

In conclusion, based on the comprehensive review of biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature available, nicotinamide riboside demonstrates significant potential for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss. Its multifaceted mechanism of action—encompassing NAD⁺ replenishment, sirtuin pathway activation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and oxidative stress mitigation—addresses several of the fundamental pathophysiological processes underlying age-related auditory decline. While the lack of direct clinical evidence in human ARHL is a limitation, the robust preclinical data and established safety profile in humans across related indications provide a strong foundation for further investigation. Advancing NR through targeted clinical trials with well-defined auditory endpoints will be instrumental in determining whether the promising results observed in animal models can be replicated in the human population. Given the significant unmet need for effective treatments for ARHL and the compelling mechanistic rationale supporting NR’s therapeutic effects, it is recommended that further research, including dose optimization, long-term safety evaluation, and direct assessments of target proteins such as TMC1 and TMC2, be prioritized. This strategy could ultimately lead to a novel, clinically valid approach in mitigating age-related hearing loss, thereby greatly improving quality of life in the aging population (Alegre & Pastore, 2023; Ege et al., 2024; Okur et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2022).

N-acetylcysteine,"Proposal for N-acetylcysteine

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) is a small, thiol-containing molecule originally derived as a deacetylated form of the naturally occurring amino acid L‐cysteine. It can be synthesized via chemical acetylation of cysteine, yielding a compound that both serves as an antioxidant and a precursor for intracellular glutathione synthesis. NAC belongs to a class of compounds known as thiol antioxidants, which are widely used in medicine both as mucolytic agents (for example, in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and as an antidote in acetaminophen overdose. Over the past several decades the clinical utility of NAC has been well established due to its capacity to replenish intracellular pools of glutathione (GSH), a major endogenously produced antioxidant. This class of compounds has also been explored for their cytoprotective properties in settings of oxidative stress beyond liver toxicity, and in several ototoxicity and noise-induced injury models, making them attractive candidates for repurposing in sensorineural conditions like age-related hearing loss (Ackah et al., 2010; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007).

Therapeutic History:
NAC has a long history of use both in clinical and preclinical settings. Clinically, NAC is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for acetaminophen overdose because of its proven ability to rapidly restore hepatic GSH levels and neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, NAC is used as a mucolytic agent via its direct disruption of disulfide bonds in mucus glycoproteins. Over the years, substantial preclinical research has investigated its role in preventing cochlear damage induced by noise, aminoglycoside antibiotics, and platinum-based chemotherapy agents. For example, in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), several studies using animal models have demonstrated that NAC can attenuate temporary threshold shifts and reduce outer hair cell (OHC) loss by replenishing glutathione, thereby counteracting ROS overproduction following acoustic stress (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007; Jackson et al., 2010). Moreover, genetic mouse models with glutathione metabolism deficiencies have shown that supplementation with NAC prevents progressive inner hair cell (IHC) degeneration and preserves auditory brainstem response thresholds, suggesting a protective mechanism reliant on oxidative stress mitigation (Ding et al., 2016). Although NAC has not been extensively tested in dedicated clinical trials for ARHL, exploratory trials and preclinical studies in models of presbycusis have been undertaken. For instance, in the senescence-accelerated prone 8 (SAMP8) mouse model, NAC treatment via drinking water produced significantly lower auditory brainstem thresholds and improved hair cell survival, with indications of reduced cochlear oxidative stress (Marie et al., 2018). Additionally, systematic reviews of antioxidants in different forms of sensorineural hearing loss have identified NAC as a promising candidate, albeit with some variability in effect depending on the etiology of hearing loss (Abbasi et al., 2021; Kranzer et al., 2015). Thus, while NAC’s historical use has been robust in other indications, its repurposing for ARHL builds on a growing body of preclinical evidence that links oxidative stress—notably glutathione depletion—with cochlear degeneration.

Mechanism of Action:
The principal mechanism of action of NAC in the context of auditory protection is its role as a glutathione precursor. Intracellular glutathione, a tripeptide composed of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine, is the major antioxidant in most cell types and is essential for neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during cellular metabolism. NAC provides cysteine, the rate-limiting substrate for glutathione synthesis, thereby restoring depleted GSH levels that occur in cochlear hair cells during oxidative stress (Ding et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2021). As cochlear hair cells age, they experience a decline in antioxidant defense, leading to enhanced lipid peroxidation and oxidation of key cellular components such as membrane proteins and ion channels. Recent studies have demonstrated that the depletion of intracellular glutathione in aged hair cells exacerbates oxidative damage, which alters the function of the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) apparatus and impairs calcium regulatory proteins like PMCA2 (plasma membrane Ca²⁺-ATPase 2) and SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase) (Ackah et al., 2010; Bai et al., 2022). NAC’s antioxidant properties extend beyond mere glutathione replenishment; its free thiol group enables direct scavenging of highly reactive radicals such as hydroxyl and hypochlorous acid radicals, thereby reducing lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in the cochlear cellular membranes (Baek et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022). In preclinical auditory explant models, NAC administration was correlated with reduced activation of pro-apoptotic pathways such as caspase cascades, particularly in settings of ototoxic drug exposure and noise trauma (Bai et al., 2021; Moon et al., 2011). Furthermore, by mitigating ROS accumulation, NAC indirectly prevents the oxidative inactivation of calcium handling proteins. Oxidative modification of PMCA2 and SERCA can lead to disrupted calcium homeostasis, which in turn affects the gating of the MET channel, an essential component for mechanoelectrical transduction in hair cells. Although direct interaction of NAC with these specific ion pumps has not been fully elucidated in the literature, studies suggest that preserving the redox environment facilitates proper function of these proteins (Ding et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2021). Thus, the multifaceted biochemical actions of NAC—increasing glutathione, scavenging ROS, and indirectly supporting membrane protein functionality—form the basis for its anticipated otoprotective effects in aging cochlear hair cells.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis driving the repurposing of NAC for ARHL is that by restoring intracellular glutathione and neutralizing ROS, it can prevent or mitigate oxidative damage in aging cochlear hair cells. In the proposed assay, application of NAC at a concentration range of 100–500 μM is expected to replenish depleted GSH levels in aged hair cells, thereby reducing lipid peroxidation of membrane lipids and minimizing protein oxidation of critical components such as the MET channel complex (Unknown Reference). Preclinical evidence from ototoxicity models has demonstrated that NAC treatment preserves hair cell viability and maintains auditory thresholds, even in models where glutathione metabolism is compromised (Ding et al., 2016; Marie et al., 2018). It is anticipated that NAC will yield observable improvements in cell viability assays, lower levels of biochemical markers of oxidative stress (e.g., lipid peroxidation products), and preservation of electrophysiological indicators of cochlear function such as auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds. Expression of key proteins like PMCA2 and SERCA are known to be present and necessary for normal cochlear function. Although direct measurements of MET channel activity, PMCA2, or SERCA function were not detailed in the context provided, the literature consistently implicates oxidative stress-induced disruption of these proteins as central to ARHL pathology (Ackah et al., 2010; Bai et al., 2022). Therefore, by protecting the integrity of these ion handling systems through GSH restoration and ROS neutralization, NAC is expected to maintain proper calcium homeostasis and ensure efficient gating of the MET channels. The anticipated effect is a delay in the progression of ARHL, as demonstrated by preserved auditory function in aging animal models. The observed improvements in both in vitro cochlear explant models and in vivo measurements in noise-induced hearing loss models support this expectation (Bai et al., 2021; Jackson et al., 2010).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, NAC emerges as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss, with several key strengths supporting its potential. Its well-established clinical safety profile—proven through decades of use in acetaminophen overdose and as a mucolytic—ensures that the risk of adverse effects is relatively low when compared to many novel compounds (Ackah et al., 2010; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007). Preclinical studies in diverse models of ototoxicity and noise-induced hearing loss have consistently demonstrated that NAC provides otoprotection by replenishing intracellular glutathione and mitigating ROS-mediated damage, which is mechanistically relevant to ARHL. The extensive literature supporting NAC’s ability to reduce lipid peroxidation, prevent activation of apoptotic pathways in cochlear hair cells, and indirectly maintain the functionality of critical protein complexes such as the MET channel complex, PMCA2, and SERCA collectively provide robust biochemical and preclinical evidence (Ding et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2022). In the proposed model, NAC is expected to restore redox homeostasis by delivering cysteine for GSH synthesis, counteracting age-associated oxidative stress that contributes to cochlear hair cell degeneration and, consequently, auditory dysfunction.

A notable strength of NAC is its multimodal mechanism of action. Not only does it serve as a precursor for glutathione synthesis, but its intrinsic free radical scavenging properties also directly neutralize deleterious ROS, thereby enhancing overall cellular resistance to oxidative insult (Baek et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2021). Furthermore, the compound’s indirect effects on maintaining calcium homeostatic proteins such as PMCA2 and SERCA—key players in sustaining the normal function of cochlear hair cells via proper calcium regulation—reinforce its potential utility in preserving the complex process of mechanotransduction that is impaired in aging (Ding et al., 2016). Its documented efficacy in various animal studies, including in models with glutathione depletion and preclinical models of both noise-induced damage and ototoxicity, adds significant weight to the rationale for its repurposing in ARHL (Marie et al., 2018; Abbasi et al., 2021).

Nevertheless, several weaknesses must also be considered. Despite extensive preclinical evidence, there is currently limited direct clinical research specifically targeting age-related hearing loss with NAC. Most clinical data relate to its use in acute insults such as sudden sensorineural hearing loss or noise-induced hearing loss (Bai et al., 2022; Kranzer et al., 2015). Additionally, while the proposed mechanism implicates preservation of MET channel function and calcium homeostasis via protection of PMCA2 and SERCA, the current literature does not offer detailed mechanistic studies that explicitly delineate these interactions in the context of aging cochlear cells. Such gaps underscore the need for future targeted studies to directly assess the effects of NAC on these molecular targets in ARHL models. Moreover, the optimal dosing range (100–500 μM in vitro) needs careful translation to relevant in vivo dosing regimens that can achieve the desired therapeutic concentrations in cochlear tissues without eliciting off-target effects (Ding et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2021).

In summary, NAC’s robust safety profile, historical use in related indications, and compelling preclinical evidence supporting its antioxidant and cytoprotective functions make it an attractive candidate for repurposing in age-related hearing loss. Its ability to replenish intracellular glutathione, neutralize ROS, and potentially stabilize key proteins involved in mechanotransduction and calcium homeostasis aligns well with the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ARHL. However, the relative scarcity of direct clinical studies on ARHL and the need for more detailed mechanistic insights—particularly regarding the preservation of MET channel function and the modulation of PMCA2 and SERCA activity—represent important challenges that must be addressed in future research. Overall, based on the comprehensive literature review across biochemical, preclinical, and clinical domains, NAC appears to be a highly promising therapeutic candidate with strong potential for preventing or slowing the progression of age-related hearing loss (Ding et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2022; Marie et al., 2018).

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid (TUDCA) as a promising repurposed candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL), organized into detailed sections addressing its overall characteristics, historical uses, molecular mechanisms, expected cellular effects in cochlear hair cells, and an overall assessment of its strengths and limitations.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
TUDCA is a hydrophilic bile acid derivative that is naturally produced in the liver through the conjugation of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) with taurine. Originally isolated from bear bile in traditional Chinese medicine, TUDCA has long been recognized for its hepatoprotective effects and its ability to modulate cellular stress. Modern synthetic processes now yield high‐purity TUDCA (e.g., Sigma #T0261), ensuring reproducibility in research and clinical applications. This compound belongs to the bile acid class—a group of endogenous steroids typically involved in lipid digestion and cholesterol homeostasis—but which in recent decades has been re‐characterized as active signaling molecules. These bile acids are known to influence metabolic regulation, inflammation, and apoptosis through their actions as chemical chaperones and modulators of intracellular signaling pathways. In particular, TUDCA has been extensively studied for its ability to modulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses and the unfolded protein response (UPR), which are processes critical for the survival of numerous cell types under chronic stress conditions (Boatright et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History
Historically, TUDCA has been used clinically to treat cholestatic liver diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis. In these indications, its role in reducing bile acid toxicity and preventing hepatocyte apoptosis has been well documented. Multiple clinical studies have confirmed its safety and tolerability in patients, which strongly implies a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in humans. Over the past decade, TUDCA’s potential has been expanded beyond hepatology into domains of neuroprotection and cytoprotection. Preclinical studies have documented that TUDCA can reduce apoptosis in models of neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). For instance, in retinal models of neurodegeneration and even in animal models for ALS, TUDCA has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and provide neuronal protection via its anti-apoptotic and ER-stress mitigating effects (Boatright et al., 2019; Fu et al., 2021). Although TUDCA has not yet been applied directly in clinical settings for Age-Related Hearing Loss, several preclinical studies have investigated its effects in auditory systems. In particular, experiments using cochlear explants have shown that high concentrations (~500 μM) of TUDCA reduce apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducers such as tunicamycin, while preserving the delicate stereocilia structure critical for mechanotransduction (Hu et al., 2016). The fact that TUDCA has proven efficacious in multiple disease models, ranging from liver diseases to neurodegenerative conditions, suggests that its repurposing for ARHL is plausible given that the underlying molecular pathologies—ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage, and apoptosis—are common to these conditions (Chester et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, TUDCA functions through multiple converging mechanisms that ultimately protect cells from apoptosis triggered by cellular stress. As a chemical chaperone, TUDCA assists in stabilizing protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby mitigating the accumulation of misfolded proteins—a critical event that triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). Under stress conditions, UPR sensors such as PERK, IRE1α, and ATF6 become activated, leading to increased expression of pro-apoptotic factors such as CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein). TUDCA effectively inhibits the induction of CHOP, thereby preventing the downstream cascade that leads to mitochondrial membrane destabilization and caspase activation (Boatright et al., 2019; Kusaczuk, 2019).

Another key aspect of TUDCA’s protective profile is its modulation of intracellular calcium (Ca²⁺) homeostasis. Calcium imbalance in the ER can lead to uncontrolled release of Ca²⁺ into the cytosol, which in turn causes mitochondrial overload and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). TUDCA supports the function of calcium pumps such as the plasma membrane Ca²⁺-ATPase (PMCA) and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA), thereby helping maintain optimal Ca²⁺ concentrations within the ER (Boatright et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2016). By preventing abnormal Ca²⁺ efflux, TUDCA reduces the risk of mitochondrial dysfunction and the activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Through stabilization of ER Ca²⁺, it indirectly supports ATP production by maintaining mitochondrial function (Kusaczuk, 2019; Lamm et al., 2025).

In addition to its chemical chaperone and Ca²⁺-stabilizing activities, TUDCA exerts anti-inflammatory effects by engaging with specific bile acid receptors. Receptors such as TGR5 (also known as GPBAR1) are expressed in many cell types, including neurons and possibly supporting cells in sensory organs. Activation of TGR5 increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP), which leads to downstream anti-inflammatory signaling cascades and the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (Boatright et al., 2019; Khalaf et al., 2022).

Furthermore, TUDCA preserves mitochondrial-ER crosstalk, a critical component in maintaining the health and function of cells under stress. Mitochondrial integrity is essential for preventing the release of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and cytochrome c. In cochlear hair cells, this preservation is vital since the mitochondria not only supply energy for active processes such as Ca²⁺ clearance but also help maintain the structural integrity of highly specialized cellular components like stereocilia (Hu et al., 2016). TUDCA’s ability to support mitochondrial membrane potential and reduce ROS production further underscores its multi-targeted approach against cell death (Duscha, 2015).

Collectively, these actions create an intracellular environment that is resistant to the detrimental effects of chronic ER stress, oxidative damage, and defective Ca²⁺ handling—a profile that is hypothesized to be especially beneficial for aging cochlear hair cells, which experience progressive cellular damage during the natural aging process (Khalaf et al., 2022).

Expected Effect in Cochlear Hair Cells and Assay
In the context of Age-Related Hearing Loss, cochlear hair cells undergo degeneration partly due to an aberrant chronic activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) resulting from ER stress, coupled with mitochondrial dysfunction and cytoskeletal disarray. The stereocilia of hair cells are crucial for mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) and are highly dependent on proper Ca²⁺ homeostasis and robust ATP production. High levels of ER stress and subsequent ROS production can impair these critical processes. Based on in vitro data, treatment of hair cell explants with TUDCA at approximately 500 μM has been shown to significantly reduce apoptosis induced by agents such as tunicamycin, an ER stress inducer, thereby preserving the stereocilia structure (Hu et al., 2016).

In more detail, the proposed mechanism in cochlear hair cells involves TUDCA alleviating UPR activation by limiting the expression of CHOP, reducing the activation of caspases (notably caspase-3 and caspase-9), and maintaining ER Ca²⁺ in a range that avoids hypocalcemic stress on mitochondria (Boatright et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2016). As a result, the mitochondrial-ER crosstalk is conserved, ensuring that oxidative phosphorylation processes remain efficient, and ROS levels remain low. This preservation of mitochondrial function is indispensable for supporting ATP-dependent processes such as Ca²⁺ clearance mediated by PMCA and SERCA, which are necessary for the resetting of hair cell membrane potentials following mechanotransduction events (Kusaczuk, 2019; Lamm et al., 2025).

Furthermore, TUDCA’s action on bile acid receptors like TGR5 may also influence local inflammatory responses within the cochlea. Downregulation of inflammatory markers can further contribute to a reduction in cell stress and improve the overall survival of hair cells. Thus, the expected effect in the proposed assays is multifold: reduced ER stress marker expression, inhibition of apoptotic signaling, preserved cytoskeletal architecture (especially stereocilia), and sustained mitochondrial function leading to improved Ca²⁺ clearance and mechanotransduction—each of which cumulatively would slow or arrest the progressive loss of hair cells that underpins ARHL (Fu et al., 2021; Chester et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation
In our comprehensive evaluation, TUDCA emerges as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss based on several converging lines of evidence. First, its natural origin as an endogenous bile acid conjugate and its longstanding clinical usage in liver disease provide a robust safety profile. This historical clinical use supports the feasibility of reallocation of TUDCA into a new therapeutic category with reduced developmental risk (Boatright et al., 2019).

Second, its therapeutic history spans multiple organ systems and disease models. TUDCA has demonstrated efficacy in reducing ER stress–mediated apoptosis in hepatocytes, neurons, and retinal cells. The underlying mechanisms—such as inhibition of CHOP induction, stabilization of ER Ca²⁺ levels, reduction of ROS production, and preservation of mitochondrial function—are all processes that are similarly compromised in aging cochlear hair cells (Boatright et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2016). Although there is no direct clinical data in ARHL, analogous preclinical models in retinal degeneration and genetic forms of deafness establish a foundation upon which TUDCA’s effects in the auditory system can be hypothesized (Chester et al., 2021).

Third, the mechanism of action of TUDCA is well characterized and ideally suited for addressing the cellular challenges encountered in ARHL. Its chemical chaperone activity helps alleviate the UPR burden by ensuring proper protein folding, while its capacity to maintain intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis mitigates the downstream effects of ER stress. In addition, by stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential and preserving the delicate balance between the ER and mitochondria, TUDCA prevents activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathways that lead to hair cell loss. This multifactorial protective action is supported by both biochemical assays and in vitro studies in cochlear explants, where TUDCA treatment preserves the structural integrity of stereocilia that is essential for proper mechanotransduction (Kusaczuk, 2019; Hu et al., 2016).

Fourth, the expected effect in the ARHL assay is clear: TUDCA is anticipated to reduce ER stress markers, inhibit pro-apoptotic signaling (as reflected by lowered caspase activation), and maintain the cytoskeletal architecture of hair cells. Preservation of stereocilia is particularly critical given that any alteration in their structure undermines the mechanotransduction machinery responsible for converting sound vibrations into an electrical signal (Hu et al., 2016). In parallel, improved mitochondrial function through sustained ATP production supports the operation of Ca²⁺-clearing pumps, thereby aiding the rapid repolarization necessary for hair cell function (Lamm et al., 2025).

Despite these compelling strengths, there remain several challenges. The most significant gap is the lack of direct in vivo evidence in ARHL models. While preclinical data in cochlear explants and genetic deafness models are encouraging, they do not fully recapitulate the complexity of human ARHL, which involves chronic, progressive changes over many years. Moreover, optimal dosing for the inner ear, particularly given the anatomical challenges such as the blood-labyrinth barrier, remains to be fully determined. Pharmacokinetic studies in the cochlear environment and targeted drug delivery strategies will be essential to translate the in vitro efficacy of TUDCA into successful in vivo applications (Shah et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2016).

Another consideration is the heterogeneity of ARHL itself. Age-related cochlear degeneration may be influenced by a host of factors beyond ER stress and apoptosis – for example, genetic predisposition, noise exposure history, metabolic dysregulation, and vascular changes. Although TUDCA’s broad-spectrum cytoprotective actions are a strength, they may not address every pathological facet of ARHL. Therefore, while TUDCA’s mechanism—centered on ER stress reduction, mitochondrial preservation, and anti-apoptotic signaling—provides a strong rationale, it may be most effective as part of a combinatorial therapeutic approach rather than as a monotherapy (Daruich et al., 2022; Gronbeck et al., 2016).

In summary, the convergent data from multiple domains suggest that TUDCA is a highly promising candidate for repurposing in Age-Related Hearing Loss. Its established clinical safety in liver disease, combined with robust preclinical evidence demonstrating neuroprotective and cytoprotective effects in retinal, neuronal, and cochlear models of degeneration, builds a compelling case for further investigation. Mechanistically, TUDCA’s ability to act as a chemical chaperone, stabilize ER Ca²⁺ homeostasis, facilitate mitochondrial-ER crosstalk, and reduce oxidative and apoptotic cues fits well with the known pathophysiological processes underlying the progressive loss of cochlear hair cells in ARHL. The anticipated effects—namely, reduced ER stress marker activation, preservation of stereocilia structure, and maintenance of efficient Ca²⁺ clearance—are well supported by available data, although additional in vivo studies and optimization of drug delivery remain necessary steps before clinical translation (Boatright et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2016; Kusaczuk, 2019).

Given these considerations, our recommendation is to pursue further preclinical evaluation of TUDCA in animal models of ARHL. Key studies should include detailed pharmacokinetic analyses in the inner ear, dose-response curves to ascertain the minimal effective concentration that yields hair cell protection, and evaluation of long-term outcomes on hearing function and stereocilia integrity. Parallel investigations into combinatorial strategies with other protective agents may also prove useful given the multifactorial nature of ARHL pathology. If successful, moving forward into clinical trial design for a repurposed indication in ARHL could offer a novel, mechanistically rational intervention for a common and debilitating age-related condition (Chester et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2020; Vang et al., 2014).

Overall, while certain translational challenges remain, TUDCA’s broad mechanistic profile, documented safety record, and preliminary evidence of efficacy in protecting sensory cell structures strongly support its candidacy as a therapeutic intervention for Age-Related Hearing Loss. Continued research and deliberate preclinical studies will be vital to ensure that the promising in vitro effects of TUDCA can be effectively harnessed to preserve auditory function in aging populations.

Metformin,"Proposal for Metformin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Metformin (Sigma #D150959) is a small‐molecule biguanide originally derived from the French lilac (Galega officinalis), which has been chemically optimized to yield a highly soluble, orally bioavailable formulation approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This compound belongs to the biguanide class and is well known for its antihyperglycemic properties that improve insulin sensitivity and lower hepatic glucose production. Metformin’s synthesis and subsequent formulation have undergone decades of refinement, ensuring an excellent safety profile in humans, as evidenced by its widespread clinical use. In recent years, the paradigm of repurposing metformin has extended into aging research due to its systemic metabolic effects and its ability to modulate key cellular pathways implicated in aging, including the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Large-scale epidemiological analyses and preclinical studies have demonstrated that metformin may yield beneficial effects in age-related pathologies beyond diabetes, such as neurodegeneration and cardiovascular disease, providing a compelling rationale for its evaluation in Age-Related Hearing Loss (Cheng et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Originally approved for type 2 diabetes, metformin has been utilized for several decades in clinical practice, with extensive post-marketing surveillance establishing its safety and tolerability. In biochemical and clinical studies, metformin’s anti-aging effects have been attributed to its capacity to activate AMPK, reduce oxidative stress, and modulate inflammatory pathways, with several preclinical models showing improvements in mitochondrial function and lifespan extension in model organisms. Although its traditional use is for glycemic control, recent animal studies have investigated its potential protective effects on sensory systems; for instance, experiments using rodent models of noise-induced hearing loss have demonstrated that metformin can reduce auditory threshold shifts and outer hair cell degeneration (Kennedy et al., 2023). Furthermore, studies such as those by Cai et al. have shown that metformin attenuates D-galactose-induced aging processes—including oxidative stress and neurodegeneration—in the auditory system, thereby providing indirect evidence for potential utility in ARHL (Cai et al., 2020). However, while noise-induced hearing loss models are not a direct substitute for ARHL, the underlying mechanisms involving mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage, and cellular apoptosis are shared between these conditions. This convergence has spurred interest in exploring metformin as a candidate to mitigate progressive hearing loss in aging populations, although direct clinical trials specific to ARHL are yet to be conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
Metformin exerts its primary biochemical effects through activation of the cellular energy sensor AMPK. Inhibition of mitochondrial complex I by metformin leads to an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio which in turn triggers LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of the AMPK α-subunit at threonine 172, culminating in robust AMPK activation. Activated AMPK then orchestrates a suite of downstream effects, including upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α), which is central to mitochondrial biogenesis. This pathway is particularly significant in post-mitotic cells with high energetic demands such as cochlear hair cells, where maintaining mitochondrial function is critical for normal mechanotransduction. In addition to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, AMPK activation by metformin leads to upregulation of antioxidant defense systems, reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and inhibition of pro-apoptotic pathways, thereby conserving cellular integrity under stress conditions (Ege et al., 2024).

At the molecular level, metformin’s actions extend to indirectly preserving the function of ATP-dependent ion pumps such as the plasma membrane Ca²⁺-ATPase isoform 2 (PMCA2), which is critically involved in calcium clearance and homeostasis in cochlear hair cells. As mitochondrial dysfunction in aging hair cells leads to ATP depletion, decreased PMCA2 activity may result in disturbed intracellular Ca²⁺ regulation, culminating in impaired mechanotransduction currents. By enhancing mitochondrial respiration and sustaining ATP production through AMPK-mediated pathways, metformin is hypothesized to preserve PMCA2 function and overall calcium homeostasis in the aging cochlea (Ege et al., 2024). Moreover, modulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) via AMPK/ERK1/2 signaling, as observed in some preclinical studies, may further support neuronal and cochlear cell survival (Cai et al., 2020). Metformin’s pleiotropic actions—spanning autophagy induction, reduction in cellular senescence, and anti-inflammatory signaling via NF-κB inhibition—paint a comprehensive picture of its molecular interactions that may collectively mitigate attributes of ARHL (Cheng et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
In the context of ARHL, the expected pharmacodynamic effect of metformin is multifaceted. By activating AMPK in cochlear hair cells, metformin is anticipated to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby increasing the number and function of mitochondria required for sustaining high metabolic demand and ATP-dependent processes. Enhanced mitochondrial function directly translates into reduced oxidative stress as mitochondria become more efficient in electron transport and ATP production, minimizing leakage of electrons that typically generate ROS. This reduction in oxidative stress is expected to curtail cumulative oxidative damage—a major contributor to ARHL—thereby preserving cell structure and function (Ege et al., 2024).

Moreover, metformin is hypothesized to preserve PMCA2 function by maintaining intracellular ATP levels necessary for the operation of this critical calcium pump. The preservation of PMCA2 is vital for proper calcium extrusion from hair cells, ensuring that the Ca²⁺ concentrations remain within physiologically tolerable limits to support sustained mechanotransduction. Given that dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and consequent alterations in resting intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations are implicated in the pathogenesis of ARHL, maintaining PMCA2 efficacy would be directly correlated with improved auditory function (Ege et al., 2024). Experimental studies in aged rodent models, where metformin was administered at doses approximating 200 mg/kg/day, have demonstrated upregulation of PGC-1α and improvements in mitochondrial integrity, thus lending support to the biochemical rationale behind its application for ARHL (Cai et al., 2020).

In addition, the expected anti-inflammatory properties of metformin, through reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, may contribute to a neuroprotective environment in the cochlea. Chronic inflammation is a well-documented factor in aging tissues and can exacerbate oxidative damage and apoptosis in sensory cells. Attenuation of inflammatory signaling would therefore be expected to further reduce the progression of hair cell degeneration, maintain cochlear synapse integrity, and ultimately preserve hearing function (Ege et al., 2024; Kennedy et al., 2023).

Overall, the cellular assay is predicted to reveal that metformin treatment in aged cochlear cells results in increased AMPK phosphorylation, higher expression of mitochondrial biogenesis markers such as PGC-1α, and decreased accumulation of ROS. Concomitantly, preservation of PMCA2 function should manifest as improved Ca²⁺ clearance dynamics, enhanced cellular viability, and sustained mechanotransduction currents, all of which are critical parameters in the maintenance of cochlear function (Ege et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Metformin presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for ARHL owing to its well-established safety profile, extensive clinical history in diabetes, and emerging evidence supporting its anti-aging and neuroprotective effects. The strengths of metformin for ARHL lie in its multifactorial mechanism of action, which encompasses AMPK activation, mitochondrial biogenesis, antioxidant defense enhancement, and potential preservation of essential ion pump functions such as that of PMCA2. Preclinical data from noise-induced hearing loss models, as well as studies on D-galactose-induced aging models, provide biochemical and cellular evidence that activation of AMPK leads to improved mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress—key factors implicated in the pathogenesis of ARHL (Cai et al., 2020; Ege et al., 2024).

In addition, metformin’s anti-inflammatory properties add another layer of benefit, given that chronic low-grade inflammation is a hallmark of aging and contributes to cellular degeneration in the auditory system. The compound’s capacity to modulate multiple aging pathways—ranging from inhibition of mTOR and insulin/IGF-1 signaling to upregulation of autophagy and downregulation of pro-apoptotic signals—supports a comprehensive therapeutic profile that theoretically targets several pathological processes underlying ARHL (Cheng et al., 2022).

However, there are also notable weaknesses and uncertainties associated with metformin’s repurposing for ARHL. First, despite robust biochemical rationale, direct clinical evidence demonstrating metformin’s protective effects specifically on age-related cochlear degeneration remains limited. Most of the supportive data come from animal models of noise-induced hearing loss or general neurodegeneration, which may not completely recapitulate the multifactorial etiology of ARHL. Moreover, while studies have indicated that metformin improves mitochondrial markers and reduces oxidative stress in neural tissues, evidence directly showing preservation of PMCA2 activity or maintenance of mechanotransduction currents in cochlear hair cells is still largely inferential (Cai et al., 2020; Ege et al., 2024; Kennedy et al., 2023).

Another potential limitation is the observed sex-specific efficacy in preclinical studies. Data from noise-induced hearing loss models have shown that metformin’s otoprotective effects appear robust in male mice but less so or absent in females, suggesting that hormonal differences may modulate drug action. This sex difference could complicate translation into clinical settings and necessitates further investigation into optimizing dosing regimens and understanding underlying mechanisms contributing to this variability (Kennedy et al., 2023).

Furthermore, while the hypothesis that improved mitochondrial biogenesis and reduced oxidative stress will maintain PMCA2 function is compelling, direct studies measuring PMCA2 levels or activity in metformin-treated cochlear hair cells are sparse. Future work should aim to incorporate precise biochemical assays to assess PMCA2 function and correlate these findings with mechanotransduction efficacy, ideally in both in vitro hair cell models and in vivo aged animal models (Ege et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2022).

In conclusion, metformin exhibits considerable promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss through its multifaceted actions on AMPK activation, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress reduction. Its long history of clinical use and safety in diabetic patients provide further translational appeal. Nevertheless, additional targeted studies—both at the molecular level in cochlear hair cells and in clinically relevant animal models of ARHL—are warranted to validate the mechanistic hypothesis, particularly regarding the preservation of PMCA2-mediated calcium clearance and the maintenance of mechanotransduction currents. Overall, while the preclinical data are encouraging, addressing the challenges and gaps identified will be crucial to determine whether metformin can be successfully repositioned as a therapeutic intervention for ARHL (Cai et al., 2020; Ege et al., 2024; Kennedy et al., 2023).

Rapamycin,"Proposal for Rapamycin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rapamycin, also known as sirolimus, is a naturally occurring macrolide originally isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus and later developed as a potent inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) (Cortada et al., 2021). It belongs to the class of mTOR inhibitors, a therapeutic category that modulates cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, and autophagy by binding to the immunophilin FKBP12 and forming a complex with mTOR, thus blocking substrate access and downstream signaling (Fu et al., 2018). Historically, rapamycin was developed as an immunosuppressant to prevent organ transplant rejection and has since been repurposed in various areas including oncology and anti-aging research (Ege et al., 2024). Its discovery and optimization led to widespread clinical use owing to its demonstrated capacity to modulate key cellular stress and survival pathways, making it an attractive candidate for diseases with an aging component, such as Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) (Altschuler et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Rapamycin has an extensive therapeutic history, first entering clinical practice as an immunosuppressive agent and later being explored for its anti-proliferative effects in cancer due to its ability to inhibit mTOR signaling (Fu et al., 2018). In preclinical studies, rapamycin has shown significant promise in delaying aging-related phenotypes including improved mitochondrial quality control and enhanced autophagy, which are central to its proposed benefits in age-associated diseases (Ege et al., 2024). Specifically for hearing loss, a body of work in rodent models such as C57BL/6J and UMHET4 mice has demonstrated that dietary rapamycin can delay the progression of ARHL, preserve cochlear hair cell function, and reduce auditory threshold shifts (Altschuler et al., 2021). While rapamycin itself has not yet been approved for ARHL in humans, the compound’s repurposing has been supported by both preclinical biochemical and auditory outcome studies, and several clinical trial searches indicate emerging interest in its potential for treating sensorineural deficits (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At its molecular core, rapamycin exerts its therapeutic effect by binding to FKBP12, which subsequently interacts with the mTORC1 complex to inhibit its kinase activity; this inhibition downregulates phosphorylation of downstream effectors such as S6 kinase and 4E-BP1, leading to a global reduction in protein synthesis and cellular growth (Fu et al., 2018). In cochlear biology, mTORC1 has been implicated in the regulation of autophagy—a critical process for the removal of damaged proteins and dysfunctional organelles including mitochondria. In aged cochlear hair cells, dysregulated mTORC1 signaling is believed to result in impaired mitophagy, leading to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and consequent bioenergetic failure (Ege et al., 2024). By inhibiting mTORC1, rapamycin induces autophagy and stimulates the clearance of damaged mitochondria, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and the ATP-dependent functions required for effective mechanotransduction (Saegusa et al., 2020). This autophagy induction has also been linked to the removal of protein aggregates and improved lysosomal function in cochlear cells, thereby reducing oxidative stress and stabilizing ion channel dynamics critical for hair cell function (Fu et al., 2018). It is also important to note that while rapamycin predominantly targets mTORC1, excessive dosage may also impact mTORC2, leading to unintended effects on Akt signaling and hair cell survival, highlighting the need for careful dose optimization (Fu et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis proposes that by inducing autophagy, rapamycin will clear damaged mitochondria in aged cochlear hair cells, thereby reducing intracellular ROS levels and restoring the energy balance required for proper functionality of mechanotransduction (MET) channels (Ege et al., 2024). In the cochlea, efficient operation of MET channels is ATP-dependent, especially for processes like the PMCA-mediated Ca²⁺ extrusion and the gating mechanism that ensures proper mechanoelectrical conversion in hair cells (Altschuler et al., 2021). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that rapamycin treatment at appropriate doses (approximately 1–5 mg/kg in rodent models) leads to improved auditory brainstem response thresholds and delays the progression of ARHL, most likely by rescuing mitochondrial bioenergetics (Fu et al., 2018). Additionally, dosing studies in cochlear outer sulcus cells have shown that low-dose rapamycin can robustly activate autophagy without significant toxicity, suggesting that it is possible to achieve beneficial effects on mitochondrial clearance and ROS reduction at doses that are safe and well-tolerated (Saegusa et al., 2020). Therefore, in the proposed assay, we would expect rapamycin to improve mechanotransduction by facilitating the removal of damaged mitochondria, reducing oxidative stress, and restoring ATP levels, which in turn may enhance MET channel function and overall hair cell viability (Ege et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Rapamycin presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss, given its well-documented ability to modulate mTORC1 signaling—a pathway increasingly implicated in the pathology of cochlear aging (Fu et al., 2018; Ege et al., 2024). One of the primary strengths of this therapeutic candidate is its ability to induce autophagy and mitophagy, thereby clearing damaged mitochondria and reducing oxidative stress, which are both central to maintaining the bioenergetics essential for hair cell function (Saegusa et al., 2020). Preclinical studies in mouse models have shown that rapamycin can delay the onset of ARHL and preserve auditory function, which supports the mechanistic hypothesis proposed by our research team (Altschuler et al., 2021). Its prior use in other human diseases provides a wealth of clinical pharmacokinetic and dosing information that can be leveraged to design future trials for hearing loss, although its immunosuppressive properties and potential off-target effects at higher doses, particularly regarding mTORC2 inhibition, are notable weaknesses (Fu et al., 2022). Additionally, differential effects in various regions of the cochlea and in vitro studies showing potential hair cell toxicity at elevated dosages call for careful titration and monitoring of therapeutic windows (Leitmeyer et al., 2015). Overall, despite these challenges, the molecular rationale supporting rapamycin’s use in improving mitochondrial homeostasis and restoring ATP-dependent mechanotransduction in aged cochlear hair cells is robust and warrants further detailed investigation, both in extended preclinical studies and eventually in controlled clinical trials (Cortada et al., 2021; Ege et al., 2024). In summary, while rapamycin’s strengths lie in its well-established mechanism of inducing autophagy and its demonstrable benefits in delaying ARHL in animal models, careful consideration of dosing, potential immunosuppression, and the need to avoid mTORC2 inhibition are critical to its successful application in this novel therapeutic area (Fu et al., 2022).

MitoQ,"Proposal for MitoQ

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MitoQ (mitoquinone) is a synthetic, mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant originally derived from the naturally occurring antioxidant coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone). Its design involves chemically conjugating the antioxidant moiety of ubiquinone covalently to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) cation via an aliphatic linker, typically a 10‐carbon chain. This design exploits the large negative mitochondrial membrane potential (approximately –140 to –180 mV) to drive the selective and robust accumulation of MitoQ within the mitochondrial matrix. The TPP⁺ moiety renders MitoQ highly membrane‐permeable, enabling rapid transit across phospholipid bilayers and resulting in a several hundred–fold enrichment within mitochondria relative to the cytosol. As such, MitoQ belongs to the class of “mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants,” a group of compounds that have been synthetically developed to overcome the limitations of conventional antioxidants—namely, their poor cellular and mitochondrial uptake and nonspecific distribution. The rational design behind this class of compounds has its roots in addressing the shortcomings of agents such as native coenzyme Q10, which, despite its inherent antioxidant properties, often fails to reach and concentrate in mitochondria in sufficient amounts to counteract oxidative stress effectively (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Bottani et al., 2020; Ojano‐Dirain et al., 2014).

Therapeutic History:
MitoQ has been the subject of extensive biochemical, preclinical, and limited clinical evaluations in various disease models characterized by mitochondrial oxidative stress. In early in vitro studies and animal models, MitoQ demonstrated superior efficacy in preventing mitochondrial oxidative damage compared to untargeted antioxidants. It was originally developed to specifically address oxidative insults in environments where reactive oxygen species (ROS) are overproduced, such as in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases. In neurodegenerative paradigms, for example, MitoQ has been evaluated for its neuroprotective properties in models of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trial in PD patients did not show significant clinical benefit despite confirming safety and tolerability, these studies nevertheless established that MitoQ can reach target tissues—including the brain—when administered orally at doses that result in a measurable biological effect (Tate et al., 2017; Williamson & Davison, 2020). In addition, preclinical studies in rodent models of aminoglycoside‐induced ototoxicity have demonstrated that mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants can reduce cochlear hair cell damage, preserve hearing thresholds, and modulate proapoptotic signaling pathways; specifically, MitoQ administered orally in guinea pigs reduced hearing loss by attenuating oxidative protein damage and lowering expression of proapoptotic markers (Ojano‐Dirain et al., 2014). Although direct clinical evaluations for age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) are not yet available, the robust therapeutic history of MitoQ in conditions where mitochondrial oxidative stress is a critical driver of pathology suggests that it could be repurposed for ARHL. In other related contexts, MitoQ has been used in animal studies to ameliorate liver damage in hepatitis C models, decrease vascular dysfunction in aged rodents, and improve mitochondrial bioenergetics in various tissues (Amorim et al., 2018). This body of work provides a promising basis for considering MitoQ as a candidate for ARHL, a disease where mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage play a key role.

Mechanism of Action:
The molecular mechanism underlying the action of MitoQ is rooted in its unique chemical structure and its interactions within the mitochondrial environment. Upon administration, MitoQ is rapidly taken up by cells and, due to its lipophilic TPP⁺ conjugate, is driven by the mitochondrial membrane potential to accumulate selectively in the mitochondrial matrix—up to several hundred–fold relative to the cytosol (Murphy, 2008; Ojano‐Dirain et al., 2014). Once inside mitochondria, MitoQ is incorporated into the inner mitochondrial membrane, where its antioxidant ubiquinone moiety is positioned to intercept ROS at their primary site of production. The electron transport chain (ETC), particularly complex II (succinate dehydrogenase), reduces the ubiquinone component of MitoQ to the active antioxidant form, known as mitoquinol (MitoQH₂) (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Bottani et al., 2020). This reduction process is critical because the active, reduced form is capable of scavenging a variety of reactive oxygen species—including superoxide, peroxynitrite, and lipid peroxyl radicals—that are involved in damaging mitochondrial lipids, proteins, and DNA. In its redox cycle, once MitoQH₂ neutralizes ROS, it is oxidized back to its original ubiquinone form, whereupon it can be continually recycled by the mitochondrial ETC. Importantly, unlike endogenous coenzyme Q10, MitoQ does not participate in electron transport but functions solely as a renewable antioxidant, protecting crucial mitochondrial components from oxidative damage without interfering with normal respiratory processes (Cochemé et al., 2007; Apostolova & Victor, 2015). This targeted mechanism also helps maintain mitochondrial membrane potential, which is essential not only for ATP generation but also for Ca²⁺ buffering and other homeostatic functions critical to hair cell survival and function in the cochlea.

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis presented, the primary expectation is that MitoQ will accumulate within the mitochondria of cochlear hair cells, where it will function to scavenge ROS generated during normal metabolic activity—especially in the context of age‐related mitochondrial dysfunction. In aged cochleae, mitochondrial oxidative stress is believed to contribute to hair cell degeneration and a decline in the functionality of mechanotransduction (MET) channels, which are essential for the conversion of mechanical stimuli (sound) into electrical signals. By preventing oxidative modifications of mitochondrial DNA, proteins, and lipid membranes, MitoQ is expected to preserve the structural integrity and bioenergetic function of hair cell mitochondria. This, in turn, should help maintain the proper operation of MET channels by ensuring an adequate supply of ATP necessary for ion channel regulation and Ca²⁺ buffering—a critical process because even subtle ionic imbalances can lead to impaired mechanotransduction and eventual hair cell death (Xu & Yang, 2024; Zhang et al., 2018). Additionally, the preservation of mitochondrial integrity is likely to mitigate activation of apoptotic pathways that are triggered by oxidative damage; in other disease models, MitoQ has been shown to reduce proapoptotic protein activation and improve mitochondrial enzyme status in stressed tissues (Ismail et al., 2020; Ojano‐Dirain et al., 2014). In the context of ARHL, where age‐related decline in mitochondrial function is thought to underlie hair cell loss and reduced auditory sensitivity, the expected outcome is improved cellular survival, sustained MET channel function, and overall preservation of hearing capacity. Thus, if administered in an ARHL model—whether in aged rodents or ultimately in human subjects—MitoQ is hypothesized to mitigate the cascade of mitochondrial oxidative damage, thereby preserving the functionality of key cochlear structures, reducing hair cell degeneration, and maintaining auditory transduction efficacy.

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating MitoQ as a therapeutic candidate for Age‐Related Hearing Loss, several strengths and weaknesses can be outlined based on the existing corpus of literature. One of the primary strengths of MitoQ is its well‐established mechanism of mitochondrial targeting and its ability to accumulate selectively in mitochondria where oxidative stress is highest. The design that links the ubiquinone antioxidant moiety to a TPP⁺ cation has been repeatedly validated in both in vitro and in vivo systems, demonstrating enhanced bioavailability and selective mitochondrial uptake. This is particularly significant in the context of ARHL, where mitochondrial oxidative damage is a central pathogenic mechanism (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Bottani et al., 2020). Additionally, the therapeutic history of MitoQ reveals that it has been used safely in a number of preclinical models—with documented efficacy in reducing oxidative damage in neural tissues, vascular systems, liver, and even in experimental models of aminoglycoside‐induced ototoxicity. The capacity of MitoQ to cross the blood‐brain barrier and to distribute to various tissues, including the inner ear, bodes well for its repurposing as a treatment for ARHL (Ojano‐Dirain et al., 2014; Tate et al., 2017).

On the mechanistic front, the detailed biochemistry of MitoQ—its reduction by complex II, redox cycling between the active and oxidized forms, and its continuous ability to neutralize ROS—provides a clear molecular rationale for its use against mitochondrial oxidative damage. In the specialized context of cochlear hair cells, where mitochondrial integrity is essential for maintaining mechanotransduction, such mechanisms are expected to translate into functional preservation. The hypothesis that MitoQ will maintain MET channel integrity by protecting the energy supply and Ca²⁺ buffering capacity of hair cell mitochondria is well supported by biochemical principles and analogous models in neurodegenerative research (Murphy, 2008; Ojano‐Dirain et al., 2014).

Nevertheless, there are notable challenges and weaknesses associated with the use of MitoQ in the context of ARHL. One potential limitation is that the effectiveness of MitoQ is heavily dependent on the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane potential. In aged cells, mitochondrial depolarization is a common occurrence; if the membrane potential is significantly diminished, the driving force for TPP⁺‐mediated accumulation of MitoQ may be compromised, potentially reducing its therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, while the safety profile of MitoQ is favorable in the context of long‐term preclinical studies and early phase clinical trials, its efficacy in human neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease has been disappointing in some trials. This inconsistency raises concerns about whether the improvements seen in controlled animal models will translate to the more complex and heterogeneous pathology of age‐related hearing loss (Ismail et al., 2020; Williamson & Davison, 2020).

Another concern relates to dosing and potential prooxidant effects at higher concentrations. While many studies have noted that MitoQ is effective at lower doses (for example, 500 μM in drinking water for rodent models), there is evidence that at supra‐physiological levels, the redox cycling of MitoQ might paradoxically generate ROS. Careful titration of dose will be essential to ensure that antioxidant benefits are not offset by inadvertent prooxidant outcomes—a balance that would be critical in a clinical setting for ARHL (Cheng et al., 2023; Cochemé et al., 2007).

Furthermore, while there is substantial evidence on the protective effects of mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants in animal models of ototoxicity (e.g., gentamicin‐induced damage), direct studies focusing on idiopathic or age‐related hearing loss are less common. ARHL is a multifactorial condition that may involve not only oxidative stress but also complex metabolic, inflammatory, and genetic factors. As such, while MitoQ addresses one critical aspect of the pathophysiology—the mitochondrial oxidative damage—it might need to be combined with other therapies to fully mitigate the multifaceted degenerative changes seen in the aging cochlea (Amorim et al., 2018; Ojano‐Dirain et al., 2014).

From the perspective of drug development and repurposing, the advantages of MitoQ are significant. Its extensive preclinical validation in multiple models of oxidative stress, coupled with demonstrated oral bioavailability and tissue penetration including into brain and potentially inner ear tissues, make it an attractive candidate for further investigation in ARHL. The established safety profile from clinical trials in related neurodegenerative settings and its commercial availability as a dietary supplement further support its feasibility for repurposing. However, future studies will need to focus on detailed pharmacokinetic evaluations in the cochlear milieu, dose optimization tailored to the aging auditory system, and controlled efficacy studies in aged animal models of hearing loss to bridge the gap between preclinical promise and clinical applicability.

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, MitoQ represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Age‐Related Hearing Loss due to its unique ability to target and protect mitochondria from oxidative stress. Its synthetic design—linking a ubiquinone antioxidant to a TPP⁺ cation—has been shown to confer superior cellular uptake and mitochondrial accumulation, which is critical for neutralizing ROS at their primary site of generation (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Bottani et al., 2020). The extensive therapeutic history in models of mitochondrial dysfunction, neurodegeneration, vascular disorders, and even ototoxicity serves as a favorable foundation for its repurposing in ARHL (Amorim et al., 2018; Tate et al., 2017).

Mechanistically, MitoQ’s redox cycling within mitochondria, mediated by complex II, delivers potent ROS scavenging capacity that is directly relevant to the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity in aged cochlear hair cells. This protection is expected to preserve the energy supply, Ca²⁺ buffering, and overall function of mechanotransduction channels vital for auditory signaling (Murphy, 2008; Ojano‐Dirain et al., 2014). The hypothesis that MitoQ will inhibit mitochondrial DNA and protein oxidation, thereby maintaining the integrity of the mechanotransduction apparatus in hair cells, is firmly grounded in the documented biochemical actions of mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Xu & Yang, 2024).

Nonetheless, challenges remain. The reliance on an intact mitochondrial membrane potential for optimal MitoQ uptake raises concerns in aged tissues where such potentials are known to decline. Moreover, the mixed clinical outcomes in related neurodegenerative diseases caution that beneficial preclinical effects may not always fully predict clinical efficacy. Dosing regimens will require careful optimization to avoid potential prooxidant effects that have been noted at higher concentrations (Cheng et al., 2023; Cochemé et al., 2007). The multifactorial nature of ARHL also suggests that while MitoQ may address a key pathogenic mechanism, it might ultimately need to be integrated into a combinatorial therapeutic strategy to yield significant clinical improvements.

In conclusion, the current literature strongly supports further investigation of MitoQ as a candidate for the treatment of Age‐Related Hearing Loss. Its robust biochemical rationale, supported by extensive preclinical data and favorable tissue targeting, makes it an attractive candidate for repurposing in the context of ARHL. However, rigorous studies—particularly those focused on cochlear pharmacokinetics, dosing in aged auditory tissues, and functional outcome measurements in appropriate animal models—will be essential to definitively validate its potential. The overall strengths of MitoQ, notably its mitochondrial targeting, potent antioxidant activity, and documented safety in multiple models, outweigh the challenges that remain. Thus, MitoQ merits advancement to further preclinical trials aimed at delineating its efficacy in preserving hair cell function and mechanotransduction in the aging cochlea (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Bottani et al., 2020; Ojano‐Dirain et al., 2014; Williamson & Davison, 2020).

Etanercept,"Proposal for Etanercept

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Etanercept (Enbrel®) is a biologic drug that belongs to the class of soluble tumor necrosis factor–α (TNFα) receptor fusion proteins. It is a recombinant fusion protein composed of the extracellular ligand-binding portion of the human TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) linked to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G₁ (IgG₁). Originally developed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and psoriasis, etanercept functions by binding circulating TNFα with high affinity, effectively sequestering the cytokine and preventing its interaction with cell surface TNF receptors (Rahman et al., 2001; Ren & Stankovic, 2018). The molecule is synthesized using recombinant DNA technology in mammalian cell expression systems, which ensures proper protein folding, glycosylation, and biological activity. As a member of the class of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), etanercept has been extensively used in clinical settings for addressing chronic inflammatory conditions; thus, its well-established safety profile and pharmacokinetic properties (with an approximate half-life of 70 hours) make it an attractive candidate for repurposing in other inflammatory-mediated diseases such as Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) (Rahman et al., 2001; Ren & Stankovic, 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Etanercept has a broad therapeutic history, primarily in the management of immune-mediated diseases. It was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and has subsequently been used for psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and plaque psoriasis. Extensive clinical data from these therapeutic areas have established both its efficacy and safety profile in modulating TNFα-driven inflammation (Rahman et al., 2001; Ren & Stankovic, 2018). In the auditory domain, although dedicated clinical trials examining etanercept for Age-Related Hearing Loss have not been registered—evidenced by the results from clinical trial database searches that yielded zero registered clinical trials for etanercept in the context of hearing loss—the drug has been investigated preclinically for its otoprotective potential (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical studies in animal models, such as those examining noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), have demonstrated that etanercept can improve cochlear blood flow, reduce inflammatory cytokine release, and preserve auditory function by mitigating microcirculatory disturbances in the cochlea (Arpornchayanon et al., 2013; Rodrigues et al., 2020). In addition, early-phase pilot studies in immune-mediated cochleovestibular disorders have explored its use, demonstrating some stabilization or modest improvements in hearing in conditions that have also been associated with inflammatory processes in the inner ear (Rahman et al., 2001; Matteson et al., 2005). However, in some trials—such as those in autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED)—the clinical efficacy for hearing improvement was only modest or inconsistent, suggesting that while modulation of TNFα signaling is a relevant therapeutic strategy, further work is needed to optimize dosing regimens and delivery methods for auditory indications (Pyykkö et al., 2007; Ren & Stankovic, 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
Etanercept’s mechanism of action is well-characterized at the molecular level. Under normal pathological conditions, TNFα is produced by various immune cells in response to inflammatory stimuli, and it exists in both a transmembrane and a soluble form. TNFα exerts its biological effects by binding to two primary receptors: TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), which contains a death domain and mediates apoptosis and inflammatory signaling, and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2), which is mainly involved in activating cell proliferation and survival pathways (Pyykkö et al., 2007; Ren & Stankovic, 2018). Etanercept acts as a decoy receptor by binding soluble TNFα through its extracellular ligand-binding domain, thereby preventing TNFα from engaging with its cell surface receptors and initiating downstream signaling cascades such as the activation of caspases and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Pyykkö et al., 2007; Ren & Stankovic, 2018). This blockade neutralizes the potent proinflammatory and pro-apoptotic effects of TNFα, including the activation of the TNFR1/TRADD complex that leads to caspase activation, mitochondrial damage, and eventual apoptotic cell death in target tissues (Aminpour et al., 2005; Ren & Stankovic, 2018). In the cochlea, elevated TNFα levels are associated with inflammatory damage, impaired microcirculation, and reduced functioning of Na,K-ATPase and potassium channels that are critical for maintaining the endocochlear potential (Parekh & Kaur, 2023). By sequestering TNFα, etanercept is expected to curb these deleterious pathways, protecting cochlear hair cells and the supporting structures from inflammation-driven oxidative stress and apoptosis (Ren & Stankovic, 2018; Kalinec et al., 2017).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underlying the repurposing of etanercept for Age-Related Hearing Loss is that by neutralizing TNFα, the drug will protect the mechanotransduction (MET) process in aging cochleae. In aged cochlear tissues, chronic low-grade inflammation, often referred to as inflammaging, leads to an increase in TNFα, which in turn activates death signaling pathways mediated primarily through TNFR1. This activation causes caspase-mediated apoptosis, increases ROS production, and ultimately triggers oxidative damage to key cochlear components such as hair cells and supporting structures. The resultant impairment in Na,K-ATPase and potassium channel function leads to a diminished endocochlear potential and a reduction in MET current amplitude (Parekh & Kaur, 2023). Preclinical studies have shown that local delivery of etanercept, such as intraperilymphatic injections in guinea pigs, can improve cochlear blood flow, preserve hair cell integrity, and mitigate threshold shifts in auditory brainstem responses following ototoxic insults like cisplatin treatment (Arpornchayanon et al., 2013; Mukherjea et al., 2015). Based on these findings, it is expected that etanercept will reduce the activation of apoptotic pathways and oxidative damage in the aged cochlea, thereby preserving ion channel function, maintaining the endocochlear potential, and ultimately protecting the MET currents necessary for normal auditory transduction. Considering that TNFα is known to be upregulated in various models of cochlear pathology, including noise-induced hearing loss and inflammation-related cochlear degeneration, the anticipated effect of etanercept would be to slow the progression of ARHL by reducing the chronic inflammatory environment within the cochlea (Ren & Stankovic, 2018; Kalinec et al., 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
Etanercept represents a promising repurposed candidate for the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss based on its established mechanism of TNFα blockade, its proven safety profile in systemic inflammatory diseases, and its preclinical efficacy in models of cochlear injury. One of the primary strengths of using etanercept as a therapeutic candidate for ARHL is its ability to selectively neutralize TNFα, a cytokine strongly implicated in the inflammatory and apoptotic pathways that contribute to cochlear degeneration. Its mechanism as a decoy receptor allows for the inhibition of TNFα-induced caspase activation and ROS production, processes known to impair both hair cell viability and the function of the Na,K-ATPase and potassium channels required to maintain the endocochlear potential (Pyykkö et al., 2007; Ren & Stankovic, 2018). Furthermore, etanercept’s established human safety profile and its relatively long half-life provide a considerable advantage over many experimental otoprotective compounds that may face challenges in clinical translation. The feasibility of localized dosing—such as intratympanic or intraperilymphatic delivery—could minimize systemic immunosuppression and maximize local therapeutic concentrations in the inner ear, as demonstrated by preclinical studies showing protection against cisplatin ototoxicity and noise-induced hearing loss (Arpornchayanon et al., 2013; Mukherjea et al., 2015).

However, there are also weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Although preclinical studies provide encouraging evidence, there is a notable absence of registered clinical trials specifically targeting etanercept for ARHL, and the clinical data from studies in immune-mediated cochleovestibular disorders have shown mixed results regarding hearing improvement (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rahman et al., 2001; Matteson et al., 2005). The translational gap from acute models of noise-induced or ototoxic hearing loss to the chronic, multifactorial pathology of ARHL remains significant. Age-related hearing loss is influenced not only by inflammatory pathways but also by numerous genetic, environmental, and metabolic factors that may limit the efficacy of solely targeting TNFα. Additionally, the optimal route, timing, and dosing regimen for etanercept delivery in the inner ear need to be rigorously defined to ensure that sufficient drug concentrations reach the target cells within the cochlea without causing off-target effects or systemic immunosuppression (Ren & Stankovic, 2018; Kalinec et al., 2017).

Another challenge is that while etanercept’s inhibition of TNFα is well documented in the context of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, its effects on mechanotransduction currents and ion channel regulation in the aging cochlea remain largely inferential and have not been subjected to extensive direct experimental validation. The hypothesis that etanercept will preserve MET currents by preventing TNFα-mediated disruption of potassium channel function and Na,K-ATPase activity is supported by preclinical data linking TNFα to cochlear inflammation and apoptosis (Parekh & Kaur, 2023), but further mechanistic studies are necessary. Such studies should encompass detailed molecular assays to assess ion channel expression, measurements of endocochlear potential, and evaluations of MET current amplitude in aging animal models treated with etanercept (Ren & Stankovic, 2018; Kalinec et al., 2017).

In summary, etanercept displays several compelling features as a candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss. Its synthetic origin as a recombinant TNFα receptor fusion protein, proven anti-inflammatory mechanism via TNFα neutralization, extensive therapeutic history in systemic inflammatory diseases, and supportive preclinical evidence in models of cochlear injury collectively position it as an attractive candidate for further investigation. Nonetheless, significant gaps remain regarding its specific application in the pathophysiology of ARHL. Future research directions should include rigorous preclinical studies using animal models of cochlear aging to directly assess the effects of etanercept on mechanotransduction, ion channel function, and endocochlear potential. Additionally, optimization of drug delivery methods to target the inner ear while minimizing systemic exposure will be critical for translating preclinical benefits into effective clinical therapies for ARHL (Arpornchayanon et al., 2013; Mukherjea et al., 2015; Parekh & Kaur, 2023). Overall, while etanercept shows promise based on its molecular mechanism and preliminary data in analogous models of cochlear damage, further comprehensive studies are warranted to fully define its role and efficacy in mitigating age-related declines in auditory function.

Resveratrol,"Proposal for Resveratrol

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol originally isolated from the skin of grapes, berries, and several other plant sources. As a member of the polyphenolic compounds, it belongs to a class of natural substances that have been extensively studied for their antioxidant properties and potential lifespan‐extending effects. Resveratrol was initially discovered in the context of the “French Paradox” and has since been synthesized and isolated in pure form (Sigma #R5010). Its chemical structure enables it to function as a potent antioxidant and a specific activator of SIRT1—a NAD⁺‐dependent deacetylase that plays an essential role in regulating cellular metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and stress responses (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 14–16). Polyphenols in this class have historically been used as dietary supplements for their purported anti-aging and metabolic benefits, and several preclinical studies across varied models have indicated that compounds similar to resveratrol can mitigate oxidative damage and improve cell survival in tissues with high metabolic demands (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 2–3).

Therapeutic History:
Over the past two decades, resveratrol has been the subject of extensive biochemical and preclinical research due to its capacity to modulate multiple longevity-associated pathways. It has been used in a variety of experimental settings ranging from in vitro cell culture assays to in vivo rodent studies evaluating neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndromes. In these studies, resveratrol demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with doses around 100 mg/kg in rodents resulting in significant activation of SIRT1 and subsequent modulation of downstream pathways such as the deacetylation of PGC-1α, thereby enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 26–27; Muderris et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). Additionally, several animal models of acute ototoxicity and noise-induced hearing loss have shown that resveratrol administration can reduce auditory threshold shifts and attenuate cochlear degeneration by reducing oxidative stress and modulating apoptotic markers (Muderris et al., 2022, pp. 3–5; Lee et al., 2020, pp. 11–12). Although direct clinical trial evidence for resveratrol in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) is lacking—as indicated by the current status in clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—its promising effects in preclinical models of cochlear damage and related degenerative processes serve as a strong rationale for repurposing this drug candidate for ARHL.

Mechanism of Action:
The proposed mechanism of action for resveratrol in the context of ARHL centers on its ability to activate SIRT1 and function as an antioxidant. At the molecular level, resveratrol binds and activates SIRT1, which in turn deacetylates a number of transcription factors including PGC-1α, FOXO3a, and p53. Deacetylated PGC-1α becomes more active, leading to enhanced transcription of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 11–13; Takumida et al., 2016, pp. 11–12). This activation is critical because mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced cellular energy production have been identified as key contributors to ARHL, particularly in highly metabolically active cochlear hair cells (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 2–3). By stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis, resveratrol helps maintain cellular ATP levels and reduces the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, which in turn lowers the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As ROS mediate oxidative stress that damages cellular membranes, DNA, and proteins—including critical cytoskeletal elements in the hair cells—resveratrol’s antioxidant properties help to scavenge free radicals and prevent lipid peroxidation (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 26–27; Hu et al., 2023, pp. 21–22). Furthermore, resveratrol downregulates pro-apoptotic genes (e.g., Bax, Bak) while upregulating anti-apoptotic genes (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL), thereby reducing cellular apoptosis in the cochlea (Muderris et al., 2022, pp. 5–7). Through these dual actions—enhancing mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative damage—resveratrol is postulated to stabilize cytoskeletal proteins in cochlear hair cells, thereby preserving mechanotransduction efficiency (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 17–18). This cascade of events provides a robust protective effect against the deteriorative processes associated with ARHL.

Expected Effect:
Based on the mechanistic insights garnered from preclinical studies, the expected effect of resveratrol in an in vivo model of ARHL is multifaceted. Firstly, by activating SIRT1, resveratrol is anticipated to upregulate PGC-1α, which enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and maintains mitochondrial integrity in cochlear hair cells. This improvement in mitochondrial function is expected to reduce the overall levels of ROS and counteract the cumulative oxidative damage typically seen in aged cochlear cells (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 22–24; Xu & Yang, 2024, pp. 2–4). Secondly, due to its antioxidant properties, resveratrol should directly neutralize ROS, thereby mitigating oxidative stress that contributes to cellular senescence and apoptotic pathway activation within the cochlea (Hu et al., 2023, pp. 6–7; Saidia et al., 2024, pp. 15–17). Thirdly, by reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis, resveratrol is likely to confer indirect stabilization of cytoskeletal proteins, which are essential for preserving the structural integrity of hair cells and ensuring the proper gating of mechanotransduction (MET) channels (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 26–27; Xu & Yang, 2024, pp. 7–8). The combined effect is expected to result in the preservation of cochlear hair cell function and a slowing of the progression of hearing loss. Moreover, prior studies focusing on similar compounds have shown that maintenance of cytoskeletal integrity helps sustain ion channel function and proper cellular signaling essential for auditory transduction (Takumida et al., 2016, pp. 8–11). The confirmation of SIRT1 and PGC-1α expression in cochlear cells further supports the notion that these cells are responsive to resveratrol-mediated modulation of gene expression pathways critical to mitochondrial and cytoskeletal homeostasis.

Overall Evaluation:
Resveratrol stands out as a promising therapeutic candidate for ARHL due to several converging lines of evidence. Its natural origin and extensive safety profile, as demonstrated in both preclinical studies and early-phase clinical investigations for other indications, offer significant advantages in terms of repurposing potential (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 14–16; Wang & Puel, 2020, pp. 12–14). The compound’s ability to activate SIRT1 and, therefore, promote mitochondrial biogenesis, reduce oxidative stress, and stabilize critical structural proteins in cochlear hair cells provides a strong mechanistic basis for its use in ARHL (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 11–13; Xu & Yang, 2024, pp. 4–6). Resveratrol’s multi-targeted actions—spanning antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and anti-apoptosis—address several of the key pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to hearing loss in aging populations (Muderris et al., 2022, p. 7; Xu et al., 2023, p. 23).

However, several challenges remain. One major limitation is the current lack of direct clinical evidence supporting its efficacy in ARHL, as indicated by the absence of registered clinical trials explicitly evaluating resveratrol for hearing loss (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, the compound’s bioavailability issues have been well documented in the literature, and achieving sufficient concentrations in the inner ear may require optimized dosing strategies or novel drug delivery systems (Lee et al., 2020, p. 12). The potential for a narrow therapeutic window, where low doses are beneficial but higher doses may be ineffective or even deleterious, further underscores the need for precise pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characterization in the context of cochlear applications (Lee et al., 2020, pp. 11–12).

Despite these challenges, the strengths of resveratrol—including its robust preclinical data in models relevant to ARHL, its extensive history as an anti-aging and antioxidant agent, and its multi-modal mechanism of action—support its continued investigation as a candidate for repurposing in the treatment of ARHL. Future research should focus on addressing formulation and dosing challenges through advanced delivery methods, such as targeted nanoparticles or controlled-release systems, and on performing further in vivo studies in relevant animal models to validate its efficacy in stabilizing cochlear hair cell cytoskeletal structures and preserving auditory function (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 16–17; Tan et al., 2023, pp. 16–17).

In summary, resveratrol offers considerable promise as a therapeutic candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss. Its ability to activate SIRT1 and stimulate the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway, coupled with its direct antioxidant actions that reduce ROS-induced damage, lays a solid foundation for its potential to stabilize cytoskeletal proteins and preserve mechanotransduction in cochlear hair cells. While further research, particularly translational studies and clinical trials, remains necessary to overcome existing bioavailability challenges and to validate the optimal dosing regimens, the current body of evidence supports continued development of resveratrol as a repurposed drug candidate for ARHL (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 24–25; Xu et al., 2023, pp. 4–6; Wang & Puel, 2020, pp. 18–19).

SKQ1,"Proposal for SKQ1

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SKQ1, chemically known as plastoquinonyl decyltriphenylphosphonium, is a synthetic mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant originally developed by modifying naturally occurring plastoquinone with a decyl linker and a triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) cation. The TPP⁺ moiety is critical because it confers high lipophilicity and a positive charge that drives selective accumulation within the negatively charged mitochondrial matrix. SKQ1 belongs to the class of mitochondrial antioxidants—a group of compounds designed to localize within mitochondria and directly neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) at their primary site of production. This class of compounds has been widely investigated for their potential in delaying aging and mitigating various age‐related pathologies by protecting key biomolecules such as lipids, proteins, and mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage. Its synthesis, as documented in the preclinical literature, involves conjugation of a plastoquinone antioxidant moiety to a lipophilic cation via a decyl linker—a design strategy that ensures both mitochondrial permeability and potent antioxidant reactivity (Unknown Reference).

Therapeutic History:
SKQ1 has been extensively studied in preclinical models addressing a broad spectrum of age‐related diseases. Multiple animal studies have revealed that SKQ1 administration, even in nanomolar doses, is capable of reducing oxidative stress markers, improving mitochondrial morphology, and delaying the onset of multiple senescence‐related pathologies. For instance, its beneficial effects include delaying cataract formation, mitigating retinopathies, and preserving immune system function and skeletal muscle integrity in aged rodents (Unknown Reference). Although the majority of these studies have focused on conditions such as cardiovascular events, renal ischemia/reperfusion injury, and neurodegenerative processes, there are indications that mitochondrial oxidative stress is a common pathogenic denominator among these conditions and age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) as well. A search on ClinicalTrials.gov using terms “SKQ1 OR plastoquinonyl decyltriphenylphosphonium OR mitochondrial‐targeted antioxidant AND hearing loss” identified four registered clinical trials suggesting that SKQ1 is being evaluated in the context of auditory dysfunction, though specific efficacy outcomes for ARHL remain limited in the published record (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical models of auditory cell damage, including those addressing gentamicin‐induced ototoxicity, have demonstrated that mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants similar to SKQ1 can protect cochlear hair cells by reducing apoptotic indices associated with ROS accumulation (Baek et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). While direct evidence in ARHL models is still emerging, the overall therapeutic history of SKQ1 and related compounds lends strong support to the concept of repurposing SKQ1 for hearing preservation.

Mechanism of Action:
At a molecular level, SKQ1 exerts its beneficial effects by selectively accumulating in mitochondria and scavenging ROS, thereby stabilizing mitochondrial membranes and preserving ATP production. The triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) cation moiety enables SKQ1 to traverse cellular and mitochondrial membranes, preferentially localizing it in the mitochondrial matrix where the electron transport chain (ETC) operates. Within mitochondria, the plastoquinone moiety acts as a potent antioxidant that intercepts and neutralizes ROS such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. This directly prevents oxidation of key mitochondrial components, particularly cardiolipin—a phospholipid found exclusively in the inner mitochondrial membrane that is critical for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the ETC (Unknown Reference). By protecting cardiolipin, SKQ1 helps to maintain the stability of the mitochondrial membrane potential and ensures proper coupling of oxidative phosphorylation.

In various cellular systems, oxidative stress can trigger activation of apoptotic pathways via the release of cytochrome c and the subsequent activation of caspases. SKQ1 has been shown in several preclinical studies to inhibit such pathways by reducing mitochondrial ROS production and thereby preventing the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) and the subsequent release of pro‐apoptotic factors (Gordienko & Iakovlieva, 2018; Li et al., 2023). In senescence models, SKQ1 not only prevents oxidative damage; it also improves mitochondrial morphology, reduces lipid peroxidation, and maintains cellular homeostasis by preserving ATP‐dependent processes such as Ca²⁺ clearance from the cytosol. This preservation of ATP levels is particularly important in metabolically active cells like cochlear hair cells, where active Ca²⁺ extrusion is essential for the rapid restoration of the membrane potential necessary for mechanotransduction (Li et al., 2023; Le Prell & Bao, 2012). In summary, the mechanism of SKQ1 involves a multi‐faceted antioxidant “shield” that protects both the structural and functional elements of mitochondria—the preservation of which is critical in preventing oxidative insult‐induced cellular damage that leads to tissue degeneration in age‐related disorders.

Expected Effect:
Based on its intrinsic properties and preclinical evidence in diverse models of oxidative stress, the expected effect of SKQ1 in the context of ARHL is to ameliorate cochlear hair cell degeneration by preserving mitochondrial integrity and function. Hair cells are highly dependent on mitochondrial ATP to drive various energy‐dependent processes, including Ca²⁺ clearance mechanisms and maintenance of the cytoskeletal architecture required for effective mechanotransduction. Oxidative damage in hair cells leads to altered membrane lipid composition, increased cytoskeletal stiffness, and impaired gating of mechanotransduction (MET) channels, processes that cumulatively result in hearing loss. Thus, by targeting mitochondrial ROS and preventing oxidative modifications of critical lipids and proteins, SKQ1 should serve to maintain the bioenergetics of hair cells. This, in turn, will not only preserve the normal rate of ATP synthesis but will also safeguard ATP‐dependent Ca²⁺ clearance and prevent the rigidity and loss of fluidity of the plasma membrane. In a well‐designed in vitro assay using aged auditory cells or in animal models of ARHL, one would expect to observe diminished lipid peroxidation, stable mitochondrial membrane potential, efficient clearance of intracellular Ca²⁺, and ultimately a reduction in hair cell apoptosis. Additionally, the preservation of ATP levels would be reflected in improved mechanotransduction kinetics and maintenance of normal auditory thresholds as measured by electrophysiological assays. The expectation is that an oral dosing regimen, which has already demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile in rodent models, would translate into a reduction in age‐related cochlear degeneration and a slowing of ARHL progression (Okur & Djalilian, 2022; Le Prell & Bao, 2012).

Overall Evaluation:
The comprehensive evaluation of SKQ1 suggests that it is a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of ARHL. One of the primary strengths of SKQ1 is its ability to target mitochondria directly, thus addressing the underlying oxidative stress that contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of age‐related auditory decline. The molecular design of SKQ1—particularly the TPP⁺ conjugate—ensures that it accumulates at the exact cellular locales where ROS are produced, offering a mechanism‐based therapeutic approach. Preclinical evidence from diverse disease models supports that SKQ1 not only reduces oxidative stress but also improves mitochondrial morphology, decreases the rate of apoptosis, and prolongs lifespan in animal models (Unknown Reference; Wanagat et al., 2010).

A major strength lies in its favorable toxicity profile and the demonstration that SKQ1 is effective at very low nanomolar concentrations. This feature is particularly attractive from a drug development standpoint, as it suggests that therapeutic doses could be both efficacious and safe, an important consideration when targeting sensory cells that are notoriously delicate, such as cochlear hair cells. Moreover, the ability of SKQ1 to preserve ATP production and protect against lipid peroxidation in mitochondria is directly relevant to the maintenance of hair cell function, where energy demand is high and the integrity of membrane lipids is essential for mechanotransduction (Li et al., 2023; Le Prell & Bao, 2012).

However, there are some notable weaknesses. While there is a robust amount of preclinical evidence supporting the antioxidant and anti‐apoptotic effects of SKQ1, direct evidence specifically addressing its efficacy in models of age‐related hearing loss remains sparse. Although some clinical trials have registered SKQ1 in the context of hearing loss, detailed outcomes or specific data in the auditory context have not yet been published (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, the complexity of ARHL—as a multifactorial disease influenced by genetic, environmental, and age‐dependent factors—means that even a compound with a strong mechanistic rationale such as SKQ1 may require combination therapies or adjunctive strategies to fully address the degenerative process. Furthermore, while SKQ1’s mechanism of preserving mitochondrial function is well supported, the regulatory pathways involving mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, and the NLRP3 inflammasome in cochlear cells remain to be explicitly characterized in the context of SKQ1 treatment (Tavanai & Mohammadkhani, 2017; Okur & Djalilian, 2022).

In conclusion, the promise of SKQ1 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for ARHL is considerable. Its synthetic design, ability to target mitochondrial ROS at the source of oxidative insult, and favorable preclinical evidence all point towards a beneficial effect in preserving cochlear hair cell function and maintaining normal auditory processing. By protecting mitochondrial ATP production and preventing deleterious changes in membrane lipid composition and cytoskeletal organization, SKQ1 may help to maintain the rapid kinetics of mechanotransduction critical for hearing. The strengths of SKQ1 include potent antioxidant activity at low doses, specific mitochondrial targeting due to its lipophilic cationic structure, and a well‐documented safety profile in rodent models. The main weaknesses are the lack of direct, published experimental evidence in ARHL‐specific models and the need for more detailed clinical data. These gaps represent clear opportunities for focused preclinical studies and subsequent clinical trials to comprehensively validate SKQ1 for treating age‐related hearing loss (Li et al., 2023; Le Prell & Bao, 2012; Unknown Reference; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall, with its well‐grounded mechanistic basis and demonstrated efficacy in mitigating oxidative stress in other age‐associated conditions, SKQ1 is a compelling candidate for further evaluation in the context of ARHL. It is recommended that the research team prioritize additional animal studies focusing specifically on cochlear hair cells and auditory function, followed by pilot clinical trials in patients with ARHL. Such studies should aim to characterize the effects of SKQ1 on mitochondrial ATP production, Ca²⁺ homeostasis, and the preservation of mechanotransduction kinetics within aged auditory tissues. Given the multifactorial nature of ARHL, a combination of SKQ1 with other protective agents may also be worth exploring to maximize therapeutic benefit. In summary, while challenges remain, the overall evidence supports advancing SKQ1 as a promising repurposed drug candidate for age‐related hearing loss (Li et al., 2023; Le Prell & Bao, 2012; Unknown Reference; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Quercetin,"Proposal for Quercetin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Quercetin (Sigma #Q4951) is a naturally occurring flavonoid widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and various medicinal plants. It belongs to the polyphenol class of compounds, which has been extensively studied for its antioxidant properties and, more recently, for senolytic activity when used in combination with other agents such as dasatinib. Quercetin was originally isolated from plant sources through phytochemical screening and has since been synthetically reproduced and purified for experimental and clinical research. Compounds in the flavonoid family, such as quercetin, have historically been used for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects in various diseases, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurodegenerative disorders (Liu et al., 2021). Its inclusion in senolytic cocktails alongside dasatinib highlights its capacity to modulate aging pathways by selectively eliminating senescent cells, which is a property that has generated significant interest in repurposing it for age-related conditions including Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL).

Therapeutic History:
Quercetin has a rich history of investigation as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent in both preclinical and clinical settings. Its biochemical actions have been documented in numerous animal and in vitro studies where it has offered protection against oxidative damage in various tissues. In auditory research, quercetin has been evaluated for its otoprotective effects in models of drug-induced ototoxicity—the compound has been shown to protect against cisplatin-induced hair cell loss in zebrafish embryos and guinea pig cochlea, suggesting potential benefits for auditory cells (Liu et al., 2021; Castañeda et al., 2019). Furthermore, within traditional oriental medicine, quercetin, as a constituent of Ginkgo biloba extract, has been part of therapeutic formulas that improve auditory thresholds and preserve cochlear function in rodent models (Castañeda et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2024). Its senolytic activity, especially when combined with dasatinib, has been demonstrated in settings other than the cochlea, such as in pulmonary and renal tissues, indicating its broader applicability as a senotherapeutic (Williams et al., 2024). Although its use specifically in ARHL has been primarily preclinical—with no registered clinical trials targeting hearing loss (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—the compound’s documented effects in protecting cochlear cells from oxidative insults suggest promise. Additionally, the oral dosing studies in mice indicate that quercetin is taken up by the cochlea without overt toxicity, further supporting its potential repurposing for ARHL (Shi et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
Quercetin exerts its beneficial effects through multiple interrelated molecular mechanisms. Primarily, it acts as a potent antioxidant. At the biochemical level, quercetin scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) by donating electrons and hydrogen atoms via its hydroxyl groups, effectively neutralizing free radicals and preventing lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes (Tavanai & Mohammadkhani, 2017; Deepika & Maurya, 2022). This free radical scavenging is particularly critical in the cochlea, where oxidative stress is a well-established mediator of hair cell damage and consequent hearing loss. The compound is also known to activate endogenous antioxidant defense pathways, including the Nrf2 signaling cascade, which results in the upregulation of cytoprotective enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutathione S-transferases, thereby providing a sustained defense against oxidative insult (Liu et al., 2021; Sánchez-Rodríguez et al., 2016).

In addition to its direct antioxidant property, quercetin exhibits senolytic activity; it selectively induces apoptosis in senescent cells through modulation of key regulators such as p16^INK4a, p21, p53, and by influencing the AMPK pathway, which in turn may restore cellular homeostasis (Liu et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2024). The clearance of senescent cells is particularly significant in the context of ARHL because senescent cells in the cochlea can secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix-degrading enzymes (the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, SASP) that exacerbate local tissue damage and impair mechanotransduction. Therefore, quercetin’s ability to reduce the burden of senescent cells may contribute to preserving a healthy cochlear microenvironment.

Moreover, quercetin has been demonstrated to interact directly with ion channels implicated in auditory function. Molecular docking studies have revealed that quercetin stably binds to the activation pocket of key potassium channels such as Kv7.4 and the large-conductance Ca^2+-activated potassium (BK) channels (Shi et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2022). These channels are essential for maintaining ionic homeostasis in the cochlea, facilitating proper repolarization of hair cells after mechanotransduction, and ensuring the precise timing of auditory signal transduction. By potentiating the activity of these channels, quercetin may help maintain or even enhance the delicate balance required for normal cochlear function.

On a cytoskeletal level, lipid peroxidation of membrane components in stereocilia—innovative mechanotransducing structures of hair cells—leads to increased membrane stiffness and impaired gating of the mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) channels. Quercetin’s antioxidant properties help to prevent lipid peroxidation, thereby preserving membrane fluidity and stabilizing the association between the membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton (Gao et al., 2022, as cited in the hypothesis; Shi et al., 2024). Collectively, these molecular interactions place quercetin as a multi-mechanistic compound that targets oxidative stress, cellular senescence, and ion channel modulation with potential benefits for maintaining both structural and functional integrity of cochlear cells.

Expected Effect:
Within the context of the proposed assay, it is anticipated that quercetin at a concentration of approximately 50 μM will effectively reduce oxidative stress in the cochlea by scavenging free radicals and thereby protecting against lipid peroxidation in the stereocilia membranes. This antioxidant activity is expected to prevent the stiffening of the plasma membrane, which is crucial to maintaining the functionality of MET channels—proteins that are expressed in cochlear hair cells and are essential for mechanotransduction (Shi et al., 2024; Sánchez-Rodríguez et al., 2016).

Furthermore, based on its senolytic properties demonstrated in other tissues, quercetin is hypothesized to selectively clear senescent cells within the aging cochlea. Senescent cells in the cochlea contribute to a pro-inflammatory microenvironment through the secretion of SASP factors that can disrupt normal cochlear function. By reducing the burden of these cells, quercetin would be expected to lower local inflammation and restore a state of homeostasis, thereby protecting hair cells and supporting the integrity of the cellular architecture necessary for proper mechanotransduction (Liu et al., 2021; Ege et al., 2024).

In support of this, preclinical evidence from rodent models indicates that oral administration of quercetin leads to cochlear uptake without significant toxicity, and, when combined with dasatinib, similar senolytic cocktails have shown efficacy in clearing senescent cell populations (Williams et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024). Additionally, molecular docking analyses have confirmed that quercetin interacts with potassium channels such as Kv7.4, which are crucial for auditory processing, suggesting that its binding may help stabilize ion channel function in aged cochlear cells (Shi et al., 2024; Castañeda et al., 2019).

Thus, the expected outcome in the proposed experimental assay is a dual benefit: a reduction in oxidative stress markers (e.g., lower lipid peroxidation levels and reduced production of ROS) and a selective depletion of senescent cochlear cells, leading to the preservation of the mechanotransduction apparatus of the auditory hair cells. This should, in turn, result in improved auditory function as measured by electrophysiological parameters and possibly histological analyses of cochlear tissue integrity.

Overall Evaluation:
Quercetin presents as an attractive therapeutic candidate for ARHL due to its multi-modal mode of action, which includes potent antioxidant activity, senolytic effects, and the modulation of key ion channels involved in auditory mechanotransduction. One of the major strengths of quercetin is its natural origin and long history of safe use in dietary and medicinal contexts, which is supported by extensive preclinical data demonstrating its ability to reduce oxidative stress–induced damage in various tissues, including auditory structures (Liu et al., 2021; Castañeda et al., 2019). Its capacity to scavenge ROS and prevent lipid peroxidation is well documented, and these actions are particularly relevant to the preservation of mechanotransduction in cochlear hair cells, which are highly sensitive to oxidative insults (Tavanai & Mohammadkhani, 2017).

Another significant strength lies in its reported senolytic activity. Although direct evidence for quercetin clearing senescent cells specifically in the cochlea is not yet robust, the mechanism—largely elucidated in other tissues involving the upregulation of apoptosis in senescent cells via modulation of p16, p21, and AMPK signaling—offers a promising avenue for intervention in ARHL, where chronic inflammation and cellular senescence play critical roles (Liu et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2024). The added potential to modulate potassium channels (Kv7.4 and BK channels) enhances its profile by directly impacting cochlear ionic homeostasis and mechanotransduction, which are central to auditory function (Shi et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2022).

However, several weaknesses and challenges need to be acknowledged. First, despite the promising preclinical data, there is a notable absence of clinical trial evidence directly assessing quercetin for ARHL (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This gap highlights the need for rigorous clinical studies to validate its efficacy and safety in human patients suffering from ARHL. Second, while the antioxidant and senolytic properties of quercetin are well characterized in many contexts, the complexity of the cochlear microenvironment and the intricacies of mechanotransduction mean that the translation of these effects to sustained auditory function preservation may be challenging. For instance, the relationship between lipid peroxidation in stereocilia membranes and the gating of MET channels, although theoretically supported, requires more precise mechanistic and kinetic studies to determine whether quercetin can effectively maintain the dynamic membrane interactions over prolonged periods (Shi et al., 2024; Castañeda et al., 2019).

Another consideration involves the dosing and potential off-target effects of quercetin. While studies indicate that concentrations around 50 μM can be effective in vitro and that oral dosing in mice results in cochlear uptake without toxicity, the optimal dosing regimen in humans remains uncertain. Moreover, quercetin has been shown in some studies to exert pro-oxidant effects at high concentrations, which could potentially exacerbate oxidative damage if not properly controlled (Deepika & Maurya, 2022). This dual nature necessitates careful dose optimization and a thorough evaluation of its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the cochlear context.

From a mechanistic standpoint, while the interactions of quercetin with cellular antioxidant pathways, senescence markers, and ion channels are encouraging, the evidence supporting its direct action on the mechanotransduction apparatus is still largely indirect. Most studies have focused on the overall protection of hair cells and the preservation of auditory thresholds rather than a detailed analysis of MET channel function and stereocilia structural integrity. Thus, further studies explicitly designed to assess mechanotransduction parameters in the aging cochlea will be crucial.

In summary, the overall evaluation of quercetin as a therapeutic candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss is cautiously optimistic. The compound’s natural origin, established antioxidant capacity, potential senolytic activity, and interactions with key ion channels make it a promising candidate for further investigation. However, significant research gaps remain, particularly in translating preclinical findings to the clinical setting and in elucidating its precise effects on mechanotransduction in cochlear hair cells. Future studies should focus on detailed mechanistic investigations, dose optimization, and carefully designed clinical trials to determine whether quercetin can be effectively repurposed to mitigate ARHL (Liu et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ege et al., 2024).

Overall, quercetin presents a multifaceted therapeutic strategy for ARHL by addressing both the oxidative and senescence components of cochlear degeneration while potentially stabilizing the ion channel activity necessary for mechanotransduction. These features offer a strong rationale for further preclinical and clinical development, despite the current gaps in direct evidence regarding senolytic clearance in cochlear cells and the explicit preservation of mechanotransduction dynamics.

SRT1720,"Proposal for SRT1720

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SRT1720 is a fully synthetic small molecule identified as a potent allosteric activator of SIRT1, a NAD⁺–dependent histone deacetylase that plays a pivotal role in multiple cellular processes including energy homeostasis, stress response, mitochondrial biogenesis, and longevity regulation (Koo, Richter, & Tan, 2024). Initially discovered through high-throughput screening campaigns and further optimized via medicinal chemistry, this compound was designed to mimic the beneficial effects observed in caloric restriction models, thereby offering promising improvements in metabolic function and cellular stress resilience (Koo et al., 2024). SRT1720 belongs to the class of SIRT1 activators, a group of therapeutic candidates that have been widely investigated for their capacity to enhance mitochondrial function by deacetylating and thereby activating downstream substrates such as PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as other targets that contribute to oxidative stress reduction and improved cellular apoptosis resistance (Koo et al., 2024). The compound’s molecular design allows it to bind to a unique allosteric site on SIRT1, distinct from the NAD⁺ binding pocket, enabling an increase in SIRT1 catalytic efficiency that results in the deacetylation of multiple critical downstream proteins without significant interference with other cellular kinases or unrelated pathways (Koo et al., 2024). Importantly, SRT1720 was originally developed with the goal of ameliorating age-related metabolic disorders, and its robust preclinical effects in extending lifespan and enhancing mitochondrial function have provided a strong rationale for its repurposing toward additional applications, including age-related hearing loss (ARHL) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of SRT1720 is marked by extensive preclinical evaluation in models of metabolic dysfunction and age-related decline, where chronic administration of the compound in rodent models has been shown to significantly improve mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress markers, and even extend lifespan by approximately 8.8% in mice maintained on regular diets (Koo et al., 2024). In addition to its metabolic benefits, SRT1720 has been studied in models of acute ototoxic insult; for instance, in vitro experiments using HEI-OC1 auditory cells exposed to the ototoxic chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin have demonstrated that treatment with SRT1720 results in increased expression of SIRT1 and a corresponding enhancement of autophagy, as evidenced by elevated LC3-II and reduced accumulation of p62 protein, markers that reflect improved cellular clearance and organelle turnover (Koo et al., 2024). These in vitro findings have been recapitulated in animal studies using zebrafish lateral line hair cell models, where SRT1720 treatment led to a statistically significant increase in hair cell survival following cisplatin exposure, indicating its potential protective effects within sensory systems (Koo et al., 2024). Furthermore, in murine models such as the C57BL/6 strain—a well-established model for studying sensorineural and age-related hearing loss—administration of SRT1720 prior to cisplatin challenge was associated with reductions in auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold elevations measured across several frequency ranges (4, 8, 16, and 32 kHz) and lower losses of cochlear hair cells, suggesting that the compound can mitigate acute ototoxic damage (Koo et al., 2024). Although most historical data with SRT1720 have focused on metabolic endpoints and acute ototoxic models, these studies collectively establish a mechanistic basis for repurposing the agent in ARHL, a condition that shares common pathological features such as mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and signal transduction deficits in cochlear hair cells (Pang et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of SRT1720 is firmly rooted in its ability to serve as an allosteric activator of SIRT1, which is a central regulator of cellular metabolic and stress response pathways (Koo et al., 2024). SIRT1 functions by deacetylating a diverse range of substrate proteins including transcriptional coactivators such as PGC-1α, members of the FOXO family, and the tumor suppressor p53, thereby modulating a broad spectrum of cellular processes including energy metabolism, apoptosis, and the oxidative stress response (Koo et al., 2024). Specifically, when SRT1720 binds to SIRT1, it enhances the deacetylase activity of SIRT1, leading to a more robust deacetylation of PGC-1α; the deacetylated form of PGC-1α is then activated and migrates into the nucleus where it promotes the transcription of genes required for mitochondrial biogenesis and function, including the upregulation of components of the electron transport chain (Zheng et al., 2024). This cascade not only results in an increased number of mitochondria but also improves the efficiency of mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, which is vital for sustaining the high energy demands of cochlear hair cells engaged in mechanotransduction (Koo et al., 2024).

Furthermore, activation of SIRT1 by SRT1720 has been shown to indirectly influence the autophagic machinery within cells. In HEI-OC1 auditory cells, SRT1720 treatment leads to an increase in the autophagy marker LC3-II while reducing the levels of p62, a protein that is degraded during autophagic flux; this reflects an enhanced clearance of damaged proteins and organelles, including dysfunctional mitochondria, resulting in improved cellular homeostasis (Koo et al., 2024). This autophagic response is particularly important in the context of aging, where the accumulation of damaged cellular components contributes to heightened oxidative stress and cellular senescence. By promoting autophagy, SRT1720 helps maintain the integrity of the mitochondrial population, thereby preserving the bioenergetic capacities of cells (Koo et al., 2024).

In addition to its effects on mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy, SRT1720 modulates the Nrf2 signaling pathway—a crucial regulator of the antioxidant response. Under conditions of oxidative stress, Nrf2 is typically sequestered in the cytoplasm and targeted for degradation; however, upon deacetylation by activated SIRT1, Nrf2 is stabilized and translocates into the nucleus where it binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoters of genes encoding key antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (Zheng et al., 2024). The upregulation of these antioxidant enzymes considerably reduces intracellular ROS levels, thereby preventing the oxidative modifications of critical cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and DNA (Zheng et al., 2024). This dual mechanism—heightening mitochondrial quality and amplifying antioxidant defenses—creates a cellular environment that is more resilient to the cumulative oxidative stress seen in aging cochlear cells (Zheng et al., 2024).

Beyond these core mechanisms, SRT1720 may also exert additional beneficial effects by modulating other factors involved in cellular survival. For instance, SIRT1 deacetylates and suppresses the activity of pro-apoptotic proteins such as p53, thereby reducing apoptosis in stressed cells (Liu et al., 2022). In the specialized context of cochlear hair cells, which rely heavily on consistent ATP production and a pristine oxidative environment to sustain mechanotransduction processes mediated by ion channels like TMC1/TMC2, these molecular effects can help maintain not only cell viability but also the fine structural and functional properties of the mechanotransduction complex (Koo et al., 2024). These detailed molecular interactions provide a compelling mechanistic framework for how SRT1720 could theoretically counteract the progressive decline in cochlear function observed with aging (Pang et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
Based on its well-defined mechanism of action, SRT1720 is expected to exert several beneficial effects in the context of age-related hearing loss (ARHL). At the cellular level, the activation of SIRT1 by SRT1720 should result in the robust deacetylation of PGC-1α, leading to the upregulation of genes critical for mitochondrial biogenesis and function (Zheng et al., 2024). This increase in mitochondrial number and function is anticipated to raise intracellular ATP levels, stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and support the energy-intensive process of mechanotransduction in cochlear hair cells, where ion channels such as TMC1 and TMC2 require a steady ATP supply to operate efficiently (Koo et al., 2024).

In addition, SRT1720 is expected to boost the antioxidant capacity of cochlear cells through the activation of the Nrf2 pathway. The subsequent upregulation of endogenous antioxidant enzymes like SOD, CAT, and GPX will diminish the accumulation of ROS, thereby reducing lipid peroxidation markers such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) (Zheng et al., 2024). This reduction in oxidative stress is particularly crucial for protecting the delicate stereocilia and other mechanotransduction structures, which are highly susceptible to ROS-mediated damage that can compromise the fidelity of auditory signal transduction (Zheng et al., 2024).

Furthermore, improvements in autophagy induced by SRT1720 are likely to promote the clearance of damaged proteins and dysfunctional mitochondria, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and reducing the pro-apoptotic burden in aged cochlear hair cells (Koo et al., 2024). This benefit is of utmost importance in aging tissues, where inefficient autophagic clearance can lead to the accumulation of cellular debris and further exacerbate oxidative damage, eventually culminating in cell death and loss of auditory function (Koo et al., 2024).

Functionally, these cellular effects should translate into measurable improvements in auditory physiology. Preclinical studies utilizing acute models of ototoxicity have demonstrated that SRT1720 treatment leads to lower auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold shifts and preservation of hair cell numbers (Koo et al., 2024). In the context of ARHL, where chronic oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction progressively undermine the structural and functional integrity of the cochlea, it is anticipated that SRT1720 will help sustain mechanotransduction by preserving hair cell survival and ensuring the optimal performance of ion channels involved in hearing (Pang et al., 2019). Moreover, the stabilization of plasma membrane Ca²⁺ ATPase (PMCA) activity due to maintained ATP levels and the protection of TMC channel gating mechanisms are expected to further support the fidelity of the mechano-electrical transduction (MET) current, which is fundamental to auditory signal conversion (Koo et al., 2024).

In vitro assays using HEI-OC1 auditory cell lines subjected to oxidative stress via agents such as hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) have shown that SRT1720 reduces mitochondrial ROS production, improves cell viability, and enhances markers of autophagic flux; these effects collectively are expected to counteract the damage induced by chronic ROS accumulation in aged cochlear hair cells (Koo et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024). Therefore, in an age-related experimental paradigm, one would predict that treatment with SRT1720 could lead to a sustained preservation of ABR parameters, improved synaptic integrity evident from the maintenance of ribbon synapses, and overall stabilization of cochlear bioenergetics, all contributing to the retention of auditory function (Zheng et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of SRT1720 as a therapeutic candidate for ARHL presents a multi-faceted picture, combining robust mechanistic insight and promising preclinical evidence with certain challenges that warrant further investigation. On the strength side, SRT1720’s well-characterized role as a SIRT1 activator provides a strong molecular rationale for its use in combating ARHL. Activation of SIRT1 is known to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis via deacetylation and activation of PGC-1α, a process that is critical for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis in high-demand cells such as cochlear hair cells (Koo et al., 2024). This is further corroborated by evidence showing that SRT1720 induces autophagy, thereby facilitating the removal of damaged organelles and protecting cells against cumulative oxidative stress (Koo et al., 2024). The compound’s ability to bolster the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway adds another layer of protection by upregulating detoxifying enzymes, reducing ROS, and preventing oxidative damage to cellular macromolecules and the mechanotransduction apparatus (Zheng et al., 2024).

Furthermore, preclinical studies using SRT1720 in acute ototoxic models have demonstrated significant protective effects on auditory function, including reduced ABR threshold shifts and preservation of hair cell populations, which is promising given the similarities between the molecular insults of acute ototoxicity and the cumulative oxidative damage seen in ARHL (Koo et al., 2024). Additionally, related compounds—such as resveratrol, another SIRT1 activator—have shown efficacy in models of auditory degeneration, thereby strengthening the rationale for employing SRT1720 in this context (Pang et al., 2019).

However, several weaknesses remain that must be addressed before SRT1720 can be considered a viable therapeutic option for ARHL. One key issue is that the majority of existing efficacy studies with SRT1720 have been conducted in models of acute ototoxicity (for example, cisplatin-induced damage) rather than in chronic, age-related models. ARHL is a complex, multifactorial disorder characterized by gradual and progressive changes in cochlear structure and function, and it remains to be demonstrated whether the beneficial mechanisms observed in acute models will translate effectively to these chronic conditions (Koo et al., 2024).

Another challenge is the pharmacokinetic profile of SRT1720, particularly regarding its delivery to the inner ear. The blood–labyrinth barrier poses a significant obstacle for systemic drug delivery, and although approaches like round-window injections have been explored in animal studies, these methods may not be directly applicable to human therapy without further optimization and safety validation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Some studies also raise questions about the specificity of SRT1720’s action on SIRT1, with suggestions that off-target effects or intermediary pathways might contribute to its overall efficacy; this mechanistic uncertainty necessitates additional research to confirm that the protective effects observed are indeed due to targeted SIRT1 activation (Koo et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2022).

Moreover, long-term safety data concerning chronic SIRT1 activation in cochlear tissues are limited. Although enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and increased autophagic flux are advantageous in the short term, sustained overactivation could potentially disrupt the delicate balance of cellular homeostasis or trigger compensatory mechanisms that might undermine therapeutic efficacy over time. As ARHL typically occurs over decades, thorough longitudinal studies in relevant animal models are required before proceeding to clinical trials (Koo et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024).

Despite these outstanding questions, the mechanistic and preclinical evidence reviewed here makes a compelling case for further investigation of SRT1720 in the context of ARHL. Its capacity to enhance mitochondrial quality control, reduce ROS-mediated damage, and ultimately preserve the structural and functional integrity of cochlear hair cells directly addresses the core pathophysiological processes underlying age-related auditory decline (Pang et al., 2019; Koo et al., 2024). The hypothesis that SRT1720 will maintain ATP production, support PMCA activity, and stabilize the gating behavior of key mechanotransduction channels such as TMC1/TMC2 is grounded in well-established biochemical principles and supported by the extensive literature on SIRT1-mediated benefits in high-energy-demand tissues (Koo et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024).

In summary, SRT1720 exhibits several strengths as a candidate for repurposing toward age-related hearing loss. These strengths include a well-defined mechanism of action involving SIRT1 activation that promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, enhances cellular antioxidant defenses via the Nrf2 pathway, and supports autophagy that together preserve cochlear hair cell function and integrity. The preclinical evidence in acute ototoxicity models—while not directly representative of chronic ARHL—provides encouraging proof-of-concept data that justify further exploration in age-related models. Challenges remain, particularly regarding optimal drug delivery to the inner ear, long-term safety, and definitive demonstration of efficacy in chronic aging models. Nonetheless, given the significant overlap in the pathological mechanisms of acute ototoxic damage and ARHL, continued investigation into SRT1720’s effects on the aging cochlea is well warranted (Koo et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Ege, Tao, & North, 2024).

Overall, the comprehensive literature review supports additional preclinical and eventually clinical investigations of SRT1720 as a therapeutic candidate for ARHL. Its targeted activation of SIRT1, leading to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved autophagic clearance, and robust antioxidant defense, addresses fundamental aspects of cochlear degeneration observed in aging. Future studies should concentrate on establishing its pharmacokinetics within the inner ear, refining dosing strategies to optimize tissue penetration while minimizing systemic toxicity, and performing long-term efficacy studies in animal models that accurately recapitulate the chronic progression of ARHL. If these investigations ultimately confirm the anticipated benefits of SRT1720, the compound could become a valuable intervention for preserving mechanotransduction capacities, thereby delaying or preventing the decline in auditory function that significantly impacts the quality of life in aging populations (Koo et al., 2024; Pang et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In conclusion, SRT1720 presents a scientifically sound and mechanistically promising approach for tackling age-related hearing loss. Its multifaceted actions—enhancing mitochondrial quality control via PGC-1α deacetylation, upregulating antioxidant enzymes through Nrf2 stabilization, and facilitating autophagic flux to remove damaged organelles—directly target the processes that underlie cochlear hair cell dysfunction in the aging ear. While additional preclinical research is essential to address unresolved issues about long-term safety, delivery routes, and specific efficacy in chronic hearing loss models, the existing body of evidence provides a robust foundation for the continued development of SRT1720 as a repurposed drug candidate in ARHL. With carefully designed studies and a strategic translational roadmap, SRT1720 could offer a novel, mechanism-based therapeutic option that significantly improves auditory health and quality of life for the aging population (Koo et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Ege, Tao, & North, 2024).

Anakinra,"Proposal for Anakinra

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Anakinra is a recombinant human interleukin‐1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) developed as a biologic drug that competitively binds to the type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1), thereby preventing its interaction with the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-1α. It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in bacterial or eukaryotic expression systems and marketed under the trade name Kineret®. This therapeutic candidate falls within the class of biologics and, more specifically, cytokine inhibitors, which have been commonly employed for the treatment of several inflammatory conditions. The molecular design of Anakinra is based on the natural human IL-1Ra protein but with slight modifications that facilitate its stability and allow for consistent production in cell-based systems. Being a synthetic protein, it bypasses the potential antigenicity associated with non-human-derived compounds, which has proven crucial for its acceptance in clinical practice. This class of compounds has previously been used in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, autoinflammatory syndromes (e.g., Muckle-Wells syndrome), and autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED), where chronic inflammation is a prominent disease driver (Dinarello, 2018; Cavalli & Dinarello, 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Anakinra has been well studied in several inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Clinically, it has been administered to patients with rheumatoid arthritis and various autoinflammatory disorders—including cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) such as Muckle-Wells syndrome—and has demonstrated pronounced efficacy in reducing systemic inflammation by neutralizing IL-1 signaling (Dinarello, 2018; Cavalli & Dinarello, 2018). There is a well-documented clinical precedent for its use in steroid-resistant autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED), where its capacity to block IL-1β has resulted in clinically measurable improvements in audiometric parameters. For example, clinical trials utilizing Anakinra in patients with corticosteroid-resistant AIED have indicated improved hearing thresholds and stabilization of inflammatory marker profiles (Chang et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although its established historical use has primarily focused on autoimmune and other inflammatory conditions—in particular where NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays a role—there is, to date, no direct clinical application of Anakinra in treating Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) per se. However, the immunomodulatory rationale extended from its success in autoimmune inner ear disorders suggests an opportunity for repurposing Anakinra to target the inflammatory component of ARHL, especially given the growing evidence implicating IL-1-driven inflammation and inflammasome activation in cochlear aging (Cavalli & Dinarello, 2018; Mukherjea et al., 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Anakinra exerts its effects by binding to the IL-1R1 receptor with high affinity, preventing the binding and subsequent signaling of both IL-1β and IL-1α. Under physiological conditions, binding of IL-1β/IL-1α to IL-1R1 triggers downstream cascades that culminate in the activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways, propagating an inflammatory response through upregulation of additional cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. By competitively inhibiting this receptor, Anakinra essentially intercepts the inflammatory signal at an early stage, thereby reducing the activation of caspase-1 and subsequent processing of pro-IL-1β into its mature form. This action not only dampens inflammation but also indirectly interferes with inflammasome activation, notably the NLRP3 inflammasome, which has been shown to be closely linked with mitochondrial dysfunction and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cochlear cells (Guo et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023). On a biochemical level, the interruption of IL-1 signaling mitigates the inflammatory cascade that would otherwise lead to increased mitochondrial ROS production. Elevated ROS levels are known to impair the functionality of critical ion pumps such as plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), consequentially disturbing intracellular calcium homeostasis—a key factor in the mechanotransduction process of cochlear hair cells. Therefore, by preventing these downstream events, Anakinra may help preserve the structural and functional integrity of hair cell mechanotransduction machinery, potentially reducing inflammatory stress-induced ion channel dysregulation and mitochondrial impairment observed in aging cells (Hu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis under evaluation posits that Anakinra’s inhibition of IL-1β/IL-1α signaling will prevent the inflammasome-driven inflammatory cascade in the aging cochlea, thereby preserving hair cell mechanotransduction. In practical terms, the expected outcome is that by blocking the initiation of IL-1-dependent inflammatory responses, Anakinra will reduce mitochondrial dysfunction—a key event triggered by excessive ROS generation—and thereby maintain the proper function of ion channels that are essential for the specialized mechanotransduction currents in cochlear hair cells. This preservation of ion homeostasis is critical because aberrant calcium signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction have been strongly implicated in the pathology of ARHL, where chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) contributes to the deterioration of cochlear structures (Qiu et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2023). Additionally, evidence from in vivo animal studies suggests that IL-1 receptor antagonism can mitigate inflammatory cell infiltration and reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, which are central to the cascade resulting in hair cell degeneration. Although direct studies measuring the preservation of mechanotransduction in aged hair cells following Anakinra treatment are currently limited, the mechanistic rationale is supported by findings in models of noise-induced hearing loss and autoimmune inner ear disease where similar inflammatory pathways are disrupted (Chang et al., 2020; Cavalli & Dinarello, 2018). Thus, in systems where Anakinra has been administered—whether intratympanically in animal models or subcutaneously in clinical settings—it is reasonable to expect that similar pathways may be modulated in the aged cochlea, reducing oxidative stress and stabilizing the activity of ion channels required for efficient mechanotransduction.

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, Anakinra represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss. Its strengths lie in its well-characterized mode of action as a specific IL-1 receptor antagonist, which has been shown to modulate inflammatory responses in a number of disease contexts. The robust clinical history of Anakinra in inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune inner ear pathologies, lends support to the notion that it could be effective in mitigating the inflammatory component of ARHL. The molecular rationale—that IL-1β contributes significantly to inflammasome activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and subsequent dysregulation of ion channels in cochlear hair cells—is biologically plausible and is supported by data from studies examining related hearing disorders (Dinarello, 2018; Guo et al., 2022). In addition, preclinical dosing information, including administration routes such as intratympanic application in ototoxicity models, underscores the technical feasibility of targeting the inner ear with Anakinra, potentially offering local control of inflammation while minimizing systemic side effects (Mukherjea et al., 2015; Lye et al., 2023).

However, several weaknesses and uncertainties remain. While there is supporting evidence that Anakinra can reduce inflammation and protect against hearing loss in models of autoimmune inner ear disease and noise-induced injury, the direct application of Anakinra to ARHL has not been fully established. The pathophysiology of ARHL is multifactorial; aside from inflammation, age-related hearing loss involves cumulative oxidative stress, genetic predispositions, and other degenerative changes that may not be entirely addressed through IL-1 blockade alone (Hu et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2024). Furthermore, while the inhibition of IL-1 signaling might reduce inflammasome activity and preserve mitochondrial function, direct evidence linking these molecular events to the maintenance of mechanotransduction in aged cochlear hair cells is currently lacking from both preclinical and clinical studies. Additional challenges include the need for accurately targeted drug delivery to the cochlea in aging patients and the potential for dosing regimens that differ from those established in younger, inflammatory conditions (Chang et al., 2020; Dinarello, 2018).

Moreover, while the concept of blocking IL-1 signaling to maintain the function of PMCA and SERCA pumps and thus preserve intracellular calcium homeostasis is theoretically attractive, the detailed quantitative impact on hair cell ion channel function, mitochondrial activity, and ultimately mechanotransduction is yet to be fully characterized. This gap highlights the necessity for further basic research and well-designed preclinical studies investigating the effects of Anakinra on aged cochlear hair cells specifically. In future studies, it would be critical to ascertain whether Anakinra can indeed prevent the subtle changes in ion channel regulation and mitochondrial dynamics that are observed during cochlear aging, and whether such interventions translate into measurable improvements in auditory function (Li et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2023).

On balance, Anakinra’s established safety profile and its mechanistic relevance in modulating IL-1-driven inflammatory responses make it an attractive candidate for further investigation in ARHL. Its repurposing for age-related cochlear disorders is scientifically justified by the increasing evidence that chronic inflammation and inflammasome activation are central to the progression of ARHL. Nonetheless, the proposal must contend with the inherent complexity of aging-related pathologies and the need for robust experimental validation that directly correlates IL-1 blockade with the preservation of cochlear hair cell mechanotransduction. Therefore, while Anakinra shows promise based on its known biology and previous clinical uses, the therapeutic candidate would benefit from additional targeted studies that bridge the gap between established outcomes in inflammatory inner ear diseases and the unique pathophysiological features associated with age-related cochlear degeneration (Kim et al., 2021; Lye et al., 2023).

Overall, our evaluation concludes that Anakinra is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of ARHL via its inhibition of IL-1 signaling. Its mechanism of action—blocking IL-1β/IL-1α interactions at the receptor level, thereby potentially preventing inflammasome activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ion channel dysregulation—presents a compelling rationale for repurposing this agent to preserve cochlear hair cell mechanotransduction in the aging inner ear. However, the translational potential of this approach is contingent upon further dedicated studies that specifically assess its impact on aged cochlear cells and evaluate long-term auditory outcomes in ARHL models. With these considerations in mind, the next logical step in our program would be to design rigorous preclinical studies that directly test the efficacy of Anakinra in preventing or reversing age-related degenerative changes in cochlear hair cells, ultimately leading to improved hearing function in aging populations (Qiu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2022).

Edaravone,"Proposal for Edaravone

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Edaravone (Radicut®), developed and marketed by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, is a synthetic free radical scavenger initially discovered and optimized for its neuroprotective properties in the context of acute ischemic stroke. It belongs to the class of radical scavengers—small-molecule antioxidants—that have been widely used in several clinical settings to ameliorate oxidative damage in neurons. Edaravone’s chemical structure enables it to quench reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals, thereby reducing lipid peroxidation and protecting cell membranes from oxidative injury. The synthesis of edaravone was achieved by optimizing the characteristics of α-keto amide derivatives to achieve high solubility and potent free radical scavenging activity under both normoxic and ischemic conditions. As a member of this class, it has been used primarily in Japan and subsequently worldwide in stroke therapy, and more recently, its utility has been examined in conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The candidate’s applicability to Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) is hypothesized based on the shared pathogenic mechanism of oxidative stress in both brain ischemia and cochlear degeneration (Lin et al., 2011; Lynch & Kil, 2005).

Therapeutic History:
Edaravone has an established history as an intravenously administered therapeutic agent for acute ischemic stroke, where a dose of approximately 3 mg/kg is employed to neutralize injurious ROS generated during the ischemic cascade. In clinical settings, its use has been associated with a reduction in oxidative stress biomarkers and improved neurological outcomes in stroke patients. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that in models of ototoxicity—specifically gentamicin-induced hearing loss in guinea pigs—edaravone administration can preserve auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds and improve overall hair cell viability. However, comprehensive searches of the ClinicalTrials.gov database specifically using queries such as “Clinical Trial Search: Edaravone AND (hearing loss OR cochlea OR otoprotection OR age-related hearing loss OR auditory)” have yielded no registered clinical trials directly investigating edaravone for hearing loss, highlighting a significant translational gap. Moreover, extensive reviews and evidence tables compiled in the literature up to 2017, for example in the work by Hammill (2017), have not documented edaravone as a tested agent for ARHL in humans; it has appeared only in preclinical models (e.g., guinea pig studies showing prophylaxis/rescue effects) and as an item in comparative tables alongside other antioxidants. Similarly, in reviews focusing on cisplatin-induced hearing loss, edaravone has not been subjected to large-scale clinical evaluation, although it has been mentioned as an experimental compound with potential antioxidant properties in auditory contexts. This pattern underscores the fact that while edaravone’s therapeutic history is robust in stroke and limited ototoxicity models, its application to ARHL remains theoretical and primarily supported by preclinical and biochemical evidence (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hammill, 2017; Kishimoto-Urata et al., 2022; Lynch & Kil, 2005).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, edaravone functions by directly scavenging ROS such as hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and peroxyl radicals, which are central mediators of oxidative damage. The mechanism involves the donation of an electron or hydrogen atom from edaravone to the free radicals, thereby neutralizing them and averting the propagation of lipid peroxidation in cellular membranes. In the context of cochlear hair cells, oxidative stress is known to induce cytoskeletal remodeling and lipid raft disruption—both critical for the integrity of the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channels. MET channels, which are responsible for converting mechanical vibrations from sound into electrical signals, rely on intact lipid components and an organized actin cytoskeleton. Damage to these structural components by ROS leads to impaired channel gating and diminished hearing sensitivity. Edaravone, by reducing the levels of ROS, is hypothesized to prevent such lipid peroxidation and preserve the cytoskeletal architecture; for example, experimental data from ex vivo cochlear explants treated with concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 μM of edaravone have shown reduced intracellular ROS accumulation and improved hair cell viability under oxidative insults. On a broader biochemical scale, edaravone’s antioxidant activity may also involve the modulation of intracellular signaling pathways activated by oxidative stress, such as the NF-κB pathway, which regulates inflammatory responses and apoptosis in cochlear cells. Additionally, by preserving mitochondrial function—which is often compromised under conditions of oxidative stress—edaravone could maintain ATP production and the energy supply necessary for the operation of the MET apparatus in hair cells. Although the exact molecular interactions between edaravone and the specific molecular components of the MET channel complex have not been fully elucidated in the literature, its capacity to protect lipid-rich environments and prevent actin remodeling supports the notion that it can stabilize the complex’s architecture and function (Hammill, 2017; Kishimoto-Urata et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2011; Lynch & Kil, 2005).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothecated mechanism, the proposed effect of edaravone in the context of ARHL would be multifaceted. First and foremost, by scavenging excessive ROS in aging cochlear hair cells, edaravone could reduce the cumulative oxidative damage that leads to lipid peroxidation, a process critical in the degradation of cell membrane integrity. This action is particularly relevant given that oxidative stress is a well-documented driver in both noise-induced and age-related hair cell damage. Secondly, by preventing the peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipids in the plasma membrane, edaravone would help maintain the delicate balance of the lipid raft domains in which MET channels reside. Preservation of lipid raft architecture is essential to sustain the optimal gating of these channels, thereby contributing to the proper transduction of mechanical signals into neural impulses. Thirdly, edaravone’s radical-scavenging activity is expected to protect the actin cytoskeleton within hair cells—specifically, the actin core of stereocilia, which is essential for structural support and signal transduction. Ex vivo experiments with cochlear explants have indicated that treatment with edaravone reduces oxidative markers and preserves hair cell viability, confirming its direct impact on the cellular components underlying auditory function. In in vivo animal models, particularly in studies examining drug-induced ototoxicity using aminoglycosides such as gentamicin, edaravone has demonstrated promising otoprotective effects by reducing threshold shifts in auditory brainstem responses. While these effects have been documented in animal models, the extrapolation to ARHL—where chronic, cumulative oxidative stress leads to progressive hair cell loss—suggests that edaravone could mitigate the deterioration of cochlear structures over time, thereby preserving hearing function. The expected outcome in an assay system evaluating ARHL would therefore include reduced ROS levels in aging hair cells, maintenance of membrane lipid integrity and actin cytoskeleton organization, stabilization of MET channel function, and overall improved auditory thresholds in functional tests. Given that key proteins involved in hair cell signaling and integrity, such as those forming the MET complex, are known to be expressed in cochlear hair cells, edaravone’s antioxidant action is theoretically positioned to counteract the molecular cascade leading to ARHL (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hammill, 2017; Kishimoto-Urata et al., 2022; Lynch & Kil, 2005).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, the candidate edaravone presents a biologically plausible and promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss based on its well-characterized antioxidant properties. One of the major strengths of edaravone is its robust free radical scavenging capability, which has been extensively documented in the context of acute ischemic stroke and ALS. This property directly addresses a key pathological mechanism implicated in ARHL—namely, the excessive production of ROS that leads to lipid peroxidation, cytoskeletal disorganization, and subsequent hair cell dysfunction. The preclinical evidence from cochlear explant studies and animal models demonstrating reduced ROS levels and preserved hair cell integrity following edaravone treatment supports its potential efficacy (Kishimoto-Urata et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2011; Lynch & Kil, 2005).

Another strength lies in the mechanistic rationale for preserving mechanotransduction. Since MET channels are highly sensitive to the biochemical milieu of the cell membrane, preventing oxidative modifications of lipids and the actin cytoskeleton is crucial for maintaining these channels’ function. By protecting lipid rafts and cytoskeletal structures, edaravone is expected to sustain the conversion of mechanical sound stimuli into electrical signals, which is critical for hearing. This aspect is particularly innovative in the context of ARHL, where progressive loss of cellular integrity leads to diminished hearing sensitivity (Hammill, 2017; Kishimoto-Urata et al., 2022).

However, there are weaknesses and uncertainties that need to be considered. Despite promising preclinical data, there is a clear lack of clinical trials exploring edaravone’s use in hearing loss or ARHL specifically, as evidenced by multiple database searches that returned negative results for edaravone in this context. This absence of clinical evidence creates a translational gap that must be bridged by carefully designed phase I/II clinical studies. Furthermore, while edaravone’s dosing regimen (typically 3 mg/kg intravenously in stroke) is well established in neurologic indications, the optimal dosing, delivery mechanism, and pharmacokinetic profile for targeting cochlear tissues remain undefined. The inner ear’s unique anatomical barriers, such as the blood–labyrinth barrier, may require innovative drug delivery systems such as nanoparticle formulations or local (intratympanic) administration, as suggested by some preclinical studies that incorporate novel delivery vehicles for otoprotective agents (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hammill, 2017; Kishimoto-Urata et al., 2022; Lynch & Kil, 2005). Additionally, while the theoretical benefits on MET channel preservation are compelling, detailed molecular studies specifically demonstrating edaravone’s impact on the actin core of stereocilia and lipid raft integrity in cochlear hair cells are still limited. These gaps in the data highlight the need for more targeted mechanistic studies to confirm that edaravone’s antioxidant actions translate into clinically meaningful preservation of hearing function in the context of ARHL.

In summary, edaravone’s strong antioxidant profile, combined with preclinical evidence supporting its protective effects in ototoxicity models, underpins a compelling mechanistic rationale for its repurposing in ARHL. Strengths of this therapeutic candidate include its established clinical use in other oxidative stress-related conditions, its molecular ability to neutralize ROS, and its potential to physically stabilize the structures critical to mechanotransduction in cochlear hair cells. Weaknesses, however, relate largely to the paucity of direct clinical evidence in hearing loss, uncertainties regarding optimal delivery to the inner ear, and the need for further studies to elucidate its precise molecular interactions within cochlear tissues. Overall, while edaravone is a promising candidate supported by substantial biochemical and preclinical rationales (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hammill, 2017; Kishimoto-Urata et al., 2022; Lynch & Kil, 2005), advancing this candidate for ARHL will require a dedicated research program involving both enhanced preclinical mechanistic studies in relevant animal models and early-phase clinical trials to establish its safety, optimal dosing, and functional efficacy in preserving cochlear structure and hearing function.

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of retigabine as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for age‐related hearing loss (ARHL). In this report we discuss the candidate’s origin, its therapeutic history, its detailed mechanism of action, the expected effect in the cochlea, and an overall evaluation of its strengths and challenges, drawing exclusively on the provided literature keys.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Retigabine (also known as ezogabine or Trobalt®) is a synthetic small molecule that emerged from a rational drug-design effort aimed at improving the properties of the analgesic flupirtine. Its synthesis involved specific chemical modifications that enhanced its affinity for potassium channels belonging to the KCNQ (Kv7) family, particularly KCNQ2 and KCNQ3. Early studies demonstrated that chemical derivatization of flupirtine could yield a compound with potent anticonvulsant properties while retaining good oral bioavailability and blood–brain barrier penetration (Reed, 2015). As a KCNQ channel opener, retigabine belongs to a class of compounds that positively modulate potassium ion channels, thereby stabilizing cellular membrane potentials and reducing the likelihood of aberrant excitability. Historically, compounds of this class have been used mainly in epilepsy management because enhancing M-type potassium currents in neurons lowers excitability and suppresses seizures (Rogawski & Bazil, 2008). In addition, the synthesis of retigabine was optimized for scale, which has since led to the production of several analogues that seek to improve potency and reduce off-target effects. These developments not only support its continued use in neurological indications but have also generated interest in applying its mechanism to other tissues that rely on tightly regulated potassium fluxes.

Therapeutic History
Retigabine found its clinical application as an adjunctive therapy for adults with partial-onset seizures that remain refractory to other treatments. Clinical trials confirmed its ability to reduce seizure frequency in a dose-dependent manner, albeit with a side effect profile that includes central nervous system (CNS) symptoms such as dizziness, somnolence, and episodes of urinary retention (Wong et al., 2012). The therapeutic history of retigabine extends beyond epilepsy. Preclinical studies have explored its efficacy as a neuroprotective agent and even as a treatment option in models of neuropathic pain and affective disorders. For example, in animal models, retigabine demonstrated synergistic effects when combined with other anticonvulsants, such as valproate, suggesting that its unique mechanism of enhancing potassium efflux may have broader neurophysiological benefits (Czuczwar et al., 2010). Moreover, there has been growing interest in the role of KCNQ channels in the auditory system. Mutations in KCNQ4 have been directly linked to progressive high-frequency hearing loss (DFNA2), and in vitro studies have successfully used KCNQ openers to rescue or enhance channel function in these mutant forms (Jung et al., 2019). Although retigabine has not been clinically tested for hearing loss per se, a number of clinical trial searches have noted investigational interest in its use for auditory conditions, including presbycusis and other forms of age-related hearing loss (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This historical trajectory—from its established use in epilepsy, through its neuroprotective preclinical applications, to emerging evidence in auditory research—forms the basis for considering retigabine as a candidate for repurposing in ARHL.

Mechanism of Action
At a molecular level, retigabine exerts its effects by binding to a specific intracellular hydrophobic pocket located in the S5 domain of KCNQ channels. This binding interaction is critically dependent on a conserved tryptophan residue—in KCNQ4, for instance, a residue analogous to Trp242 in other isoforms—that is essential for drug binding and efficacy (Rim et al., 2021; Rogawski & Bazil, 2008). Once bound, retigabine shifts the voltage-dependence of channel activation toward more hyperpolarized potentials, meaning that these channels open at lower membrane potentials than would otherwise be required. This leads to an enhanced efflux of potassium ions (K⁺) from the cell, which in turn stabilizes the resting membrane potential and prevents the excessive depolarization that underlies neuronal hyperexcitability.

In neurons, this action translates into a robust anticonvulsant effect. However, the same molecular interactions are likely to be relevant in non-neuronal tissues such as the cochlea. In the inner ear, particularly in glial-like supporting cells adjacent to the stria vascularis and in outer hair cells, KCNQ channels play an essential role in the recycling of K⁺ ions and in the maintenance of the endocochlear potential (EP). The EP, which normally ranges from +80 to +100 mV, is a critical ionic gradient that drives mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) in hair cells (Leitner, 2012; Bazard et al., 2021). By activating KCNQ channels, retigabine may facilitate K⁺ efflux and subsequent recycling that supports a stable EP. Importantly, electrophysiological studies have shown that retigabine can restore diminished potassium currents in cell models expressing mutant forms of KCNQ4, underscoring its potential to counteract the effects of genetic or age-related channel dysfunction (Czuczwar et al., 2010; Rim et al., 2021). Thus, the molecular mechanism involves both a direct modification of the voltage-sensing properties of the channel and an indirect normalization of ion homeostasis, which is central to the proposed benefit in ARHL.

Expected Effect
The core hypothesis for repurposing retigabine in ARHL is based on its ability to enhance potassium efflux from cochlear supporting cells, which is instrumental in maintaining the endocochlear potential. Aging cochleae often suffer from a decline in EP due to dysfunctions in potassium recycling mechanisms, partly resulting from deficits in ion channels and transporters such as KCNJ10 and NKCC1 as indicated by recent pathophysiological insights (Bazard et al., 2021). In this context, retigabine is expected to target KCNQ channels expressed in the supporting cells lining the stria vascularis, thereby promoting K⁺ recycling and preserving the positive EP. Experimental models have demonstrated that loss of proper K⁺ recycling is directly linked to diminished EP, which in turn impairs the depolarization of hair cells during sound transduction. With proper activation of KCNQ channels by retigabine, the cells’ ability to extrude K⁺ should be enhanced, which will help to restore or maintain the EP.

Moreover, by maintaining a stable EP, the mechanoelectrical transduction current in hair cells can be preserved—a critical factor in sustaining hair cell responsiveness to acoustic stimuli. This effect is particularly important against the backdrop of age-related changes, where gradual deterioration in ionic homeostasis leads to a reduction in hair cell sensitivity and ultimately contributes to hearing loss. In preclinical settings, doses of retigabine around 10 mg/kg in rodents have been shown to activate KCNQ channels in similar cellular contexts. It is plausible that such dosing can be optimized to achieve a similar benefit in the cochlea without provoking significant systemic side effects (Rim et al., 2021). Additionally, in vitro studies have provided evidence that KCNQ openers can rescue the diminished potassium currents observed in mutant conditions linked to DFNA2, supporting the idea that a similar strategy could stabilize EP in the aging cochlea (Jung et al., 2019). Overall, the expected effect is that retigabine will preserve the ionic milieu of the endolymph by normalizing K⁺ cycling, thereby indirectly sustaining MET current amplitudes in hair cells and protecting or even improving auditory sensitivity in age-related hearing loss.

Overall Evaluation
Retigabine offers a promising avenue for repurposing in ARHL, owing mainly to its well-elucidated mechanism as a KCNQ channel opener and its proven capacity to stabilize membrane excitability. One of its most compelling strengths is its ability to induce a hyperpolarizing shift in the activation of KCNQ channels, thus facilitating potassium efflux in a controlled manner that is likely to be beneficial in restoring EP in the cochlea (Rim et al., 2021; Rogawski & Bazil, 2008). The chemical derivation of retigabine from flupirtine and its extensive clinical evaluation in epilepsy have provided a robust safety and pharmacokinetic framework, which is an important foundation when considering its repurposing for another indication (Reed, 2015; Wong et al., 2012).

That said, several challenges remain. The known adverse effects of retigabine, including CNS-related side effects such as dizziness and somnolence and more unique issues such as retinal pigmentation and urinary retention, raise concerns for chronic use, particularly in an elderly population that may already be vulnerable (Wong et al., 2012). These side effects necessitate careful dose optimization, and there may be a need to develop analogues or modified formulations that are more selective for cochlear KCNQ subtypes (for example, targeting KCNQ4 specifically) while avoiding channels that contribute to unwanted systemic effects. Further complicating matters is the limited in vivo evidence directly correlating retigabine administration with improvements in the endocochlear potential or hair cell function in aged animal models. While in vitro data and cellular assays have demonstrated its capacity to rescue diminished KCNQ activity in mutant channels (Czuczwar et al., 2010), translation of these results to the complex environment of the aging cochlea remains an open question (Leitner, 2012).

Moreover, the heterogeneous expression of KCNQ isoforms in the auditory system suggests that further research is needed to tailor a dosing regimen that maximizes the benefit to the cochlear microenvironment while minimizing off-target effects on neuronal populations where KCNQ channels play different roles. This is particularly important because retigabine has been primarily optimized to affect KCNQ2/3 channels in the central nervous system, and its activity profile towards KCNQ4 in cochlear tissues may differ (Rim et al., 2021; Taglialatela, n.d.).

In summary, the overall assessment of retigabine as a candidate for ARHL is characterized by a strong scientific rationale based on its mechanism of action—the stabilization of membrane potentials via enhanced K⁺ efflux—and the preliminary supporting evidence from in vitro models of cochlear ion homeostasis. However, the candidate faces significant translational challenges, notably its adverse effect profile and the need for definitive in vivo data demonstrating its impact on the EP and hair cell function in aged subjects. These issues must be addressed through rigorous preclinical studies, including dose optimization experiments in aged rodent models that assess both auditory function and systemic toxicity.

Future Directions and Recommendations
Based on the comprehensive evaluation above, several critical steps should be taken in future investigations before retigabine can be considered a viable treatment for age-related hearing loss:

1. Rigorous Preclinical Testing in Aged Animal Models
It will be essential to conduct detailed electrophysiological and histological studies in aged rodent models to evaluate whether retigabine administration can indeed preserve or restore the endocochlear potential. Such tests should include measurements of EP, assessments of K⁺ recycling dynamics in supporting cells, and evaluation of hair cell survival and mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) current amplitudes. These experiments must be performed over a range of dosing regimens to define the minimal effective dose that achieves the desired cochlear effects without provoking unacceptable systemic side effects (Rim et al., 2021).

2. Optimization of Dosing and Formulation
Given moderate CNS side effects observed in earlier epilepsy trials, it may be necessary to develop a formulation of retigabine or its analogues that can preferentially target the cochlea. Strategies might include localized delivery methods to minimize systemic exposure or the design of derivative compounds with increased specificity for the KCNQ4 isoform. Such modifications would aim to restrict the drug action primarily to cochlear tissues while sparing other regions of the brain that might contribute to the adverse effect profile (Taglialatela, n.d.; Rim et al., 2021).

3. In-Depth Pharmacodynamic and Toxicodynamic Evaluations
Comprehensive pharmacodynamic studies must be initiated to elucidate the specific interactions between retigabine and cochlear KCNQ channels under conditions that mimic the aging environment. Additionally, long-term toxicology studies in animal models will be essential to further characterize the risk profile of chronic retigabine administration, particularly with regard to retinal changes, urinary retention, and other CNS-related effects. This will help define the therapeutic window and ensure that the potential benefits in preserving auditory function outweigh the risks for elderly patients (Wong et al., 2012; Leitner, 2012).

4. Evaluating Biomarkers of Efficacy
An important component of future studies should be the identification and validation of biomarkers that can reliably indicate improvements in cochlear ion homeostasis and EP stabilization. This may involve advanced imaging techniques, biochemical markers in perilymph samples, or direct electrophysiological recordings from the cochlea. Such biomarkers will not only facilitate the early detection of therapeutic efficacy but also be critical in the design of future clinical trials.

5. Pilot Clinical Studies
Should preclinical studies yield promising results, pilot clinical studies in an elderly cohort with ARHL would be the next step. These studies would need to be designed carefully with a focus on both auditory outcomes (such as hearing thresholds, speech recognition scores, and EP recordings where possible) and systemic safety. Given the vulnerable nature of the elderly population, extensive monitoring for adverse events is essential, and study designs may also incorporate adaptive dosing strategies to limit side effects.

Overall, the repurposing of retigabine for ARHL is scientifically attractive due to its established mechanism of modulating potassium currents and its potential to stabilize the ionic environment necessary for auditory transduction. The candidate’s strengths are its well-documented ability to hyperpolarize cell membranes by activating KCNQ channels (Rim et al., 2021) and the wealth of clinical experience in the epilepsy field that provides valuable data on pharmacokinetics and safety (Wong et al., 2012). Nevertheless, challenges remain regarding its adverse effect profile and the need for selective action within the cochlea. A careful balance between systemic exposure and localized efficacy must therefore be achieved.

In conclusion, while retigabine’s repurposing for age-related hearing loss represents an ambitious and scientifically grounded strategy, significant work remains to establish its clinical utility in this new indication. The mechanistic rationale is strong, but the key to successful translation will lie in addressing the extra complexities of the auditory system compared to the central nervous system. Future research must focus not only on validating the preservation of the endocochlear potential but also on developing more selective compounds or formulations that minimize systemic adverse effects while enhancing cochlear benefits.

Based on the current evidence from synthesis and mechanism studies (Reed, 2015; Rogawski & Bazil, 2008), combined with the promising in vitro rescue of mutant KCNQ4 channels (Czuczwar et al., 2010; Jung et al., 2019), retigabine appears to be a promising candidate for further investigation in ARHL. The clinical trial search data also indicate a growing interest in the broader application of KCNQ channel modulators in hearing loss contexts (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, the specific impact on the maintenance of the endocochlear potential in the aging cochlea remains to be directly demonstrated, and the known CNS and systemic side effects of retigabine present a separate challenge (Wong et al., 2012; Leitner, 2012).

Future studies will need to systematically address these gaps through:
• Detailed electrophysiological evaluation of EP modulation in aged animal models, using retigabine at doses optimized to balance efficacy with systemic tolerability.
• Medicinal chemistry efforts to refine retigabine analogues that show enhanced selectivity for cochlear KCNQ4 channels, potentially reducing off-target activation of KCNQ2/3 channels in the CNS.
• Comprehensive toxicology studies, particularly focusing on long-term administration in elderly models, with special attention to retinal, urinary, and central nervous system safety profiles.
• The use of advanced biomarkers and imaging techniques to correlate retigabine-induced changes in K⁺ channel function with preserved or improved auditory sensitivity.

In summary, our evaluation indicates that retigabine holds promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for ARHL due to its capacity to enhance potassium efflux via KCNQ channels, thereby potentially stabilizing the endocochlear potential and preserving mechanoelectrical transduction. Nonetheless, before advancing into clinical trials for hearing loss, additional preclinical studies must fully establish both its efficacy in the cochlear environment and prove that its adverse effect profile can be managed in the target elderly population. Given the significant socioeconomic burden of age‐related hearing loss and the limited current treatment options, pursuing this repurposing strategy with rigorous translational studies is well justified.

Trehalose,"Proposal for Trehalose

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Trehalose is a naturally occurring nonreducing disaccharide, composed of two glucose molecules linked in an α,α-1,1-glycosidic bond, which is widely distributed in many organisms—including bacteria, fungi, plants, and invertebrates—but is not endogenously synthesized by mammals (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Traditionally, trehalose has been used in those organisms as a stress protectant because of its ability to stabilize proteins and cellular membranes under adverse conditions. Chemically, it is inexpensive and generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA, with extensive use as a dietary excipient and sweetener. Trehalose belongs to the class of carbohydrate-based therapeutic compounds and is increasingly recognized as an mTOR‐independent autophagy enhancer. This unique property distinguishes it from other autophagy inducers, such as rapamycin, which rely on mTOR inhibition and are associated with off-target effects including immune suppression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Lotfi et al., 2018). Trehalose’s capacity to promote autophagic clearance stems from its ability to activate the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, thereby enhancing the degradation of damaged proteins and dysfunctional organelles. Its molecular structure affords it the ability to interact with and stabilize membrane components, which is critical for preserving cell integrity under stress, and lends support to its potential use in conditions characterized by aberrant protein accumulation and membrane rigidity, such as age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) (Wang et al., 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Trehalose has been studied extensively in biochemical, preclinical, and clinical contexts for a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and certain lysosomal storage disorders. In these contexts, it has demonstrated the ability to reduce protein aggregation, clear dysfunctional mitochondria, and decrease oxidative stress via enhanced autophagy and proteostasis (Lotfi et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020). Preclinical studies using cell and animal models have shown that trehalose can reduce aggregation-prone proteins—such as alpha-synuclein, amyloid-β, and TDP-43—improving neuronal viability (Ye et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018). Although there are no registered clinical trials directly targeting ARHL with trehalose (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), the wealth of data supporting its neuroprotective and proteostatic effects in neurodegenerative models lays a strong translational foundation for its repurposing in the field of auditory research. Additionally, interventions that have been effective in other age-related neurodegenerative contexts may be particularly relevant for ARHL, given that similar age-dependent defects in autophagy and mitochondrial function are implicated in both conditions (Ege et al., 2024; Fu & Chai, 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, trehalose acts as an autophagy enhancer through an mTOR-independent mechanism. Unlike rapamycin, which inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and thereby indirectly stimulates autophagy, trehalose bypasses the mTOR pathway. Instead, trehalose directly facilitates autophagic flux in cells by activating transcription factor EB (TFEB), which serves as a master regulator governing lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy gene expression (Fu & Chai, 2019; Ye et al., 2019). Upon activation, TFEB translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where it upregulates genes involved in autophagosome formation, lysosomal function, and the clearance of damaged proteins and organelles. This process is particularly crucial in postmitotic cells such as cochlear hair cells, which rely on efficient autophagic clearance to maintain proteostasis and mitochondrial quality over the long lifespan of the cell (Ege et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023).

In aging cochlear hair cells, impaired autophagy leads to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, misfolded proteins, and oxidized lipids. These cellular debris, if not removed timely, can cause membrane stiffness and disrupt mechanotransduction—the process by which hair cells convert mechanical stimuli from sound waves into electrical signals. Trehalose is hypothesized to counteract these deleterious changes by promoting the clearance of aggregated proteins and defective organelles, and by restoring the normal biophysical properties of the hair cell membrane (Ege et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023). Moreover, by stabilizing membrane fluidity, trehalose may help maintain the dynamic behavior of mechanotransduction (MET) channels, which are essential for auditory function. Activation of TFEB has been associated with improved lysosomal acidification and function, further aiding in the degradation of cellular waste and providing cytoprotective effects in multiple neurodegenerative contexts (Fu & Chai, 2019; Lotfi et al., 2018).

Additional research supports that trehalose exerts beneficial effects without interfering with mTOR signaling pathways, potentially avoiding the adverse effects linked with mTOR inhibitors, such as immunosuppression. Instead, it induces autophagy by mechanisms that may involve stabilizing membranes and proteins directly and indirectly influencing other stress response pathways—from heat shock protein response to antioxidant defenses (Wang et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2021). Importantly, transcription factors and signaling molecules crucial for cochlear cell maintenance, including those associated with mitochondrial quality control (e.g., PGC-1α) and cellular antioxidative responses (e.g., SIRT1), may interact with trehalose-mediated autophagic mechanisms, thus preserving cell structure and function under conditions of age-related stress (Ege et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis is that trehalose, at a therapeutically relevant concentration—such as 100 mM in culture systems—will promote the clearance of damaged proteins and organelles in aging cochlear hair cells by enhancing autophagic flux, independent of mTOR inhibition. By stimulating nuclear translocation of TFEB, trehalose is expected to upregulate the suite of genes responsible for lysosomal biogenesis and the autophagy pathway, thereby facilitating the degradation of oxidatively modified proteins, fragmented mitochondria, and lipid aggregates. As a result, the buildup of cytotoxic aggregates that can stiffen the cell membrane and interfere with mechanotransduction channel dynamics will be reduced (Ege et al., 2024; Fu & Chai, 2019).

In practical terms, in vitro assays (e.g., using cultured cochlear hair cells or auditory cell lines) should reveal an increase in autophagy markers such as LC3-II and a decrease in the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins upon trehalose treatment. Additionally, activation and nuclear localization of TFEB can be monitored through immunofluorescence assays, with expectations of a significant increase in nuclear TFEB signal after treatment with trehalose (Ye et al., 2019; Fu & Chai, 2019). The removal of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy should help restore mitochondrial membrane potential and overall energy homeostasis in these cells, thereby protecting against further oxidative injury. This restoration is crucial because mitochondrial dysfunction is a key driver of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which exacerbates cellular damage and contributes to the progression of ARHL (Li et al., 2023).

Regarding mechanotransduction channels, well-maintained membrane fluidity underlies the rapid conformational changes of the MET channels, essential for converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals in auditory hair cells. Trehalose’s ability to stabilize membranes is expected to preserve this fluidity, thereby maintaining proper MET channel gating and ensuring normal auditory function. The anticipated outcome is that long-term trehalose administration, by preserving the structural and functional integrity of cochlear hair cells, would slow or even prevent the progression of ARHL in preclinical models (Ege et al., 2024; Tavanai et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Trehalose emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss based on an extensive body of preclinical evidence that highlights the significance of autophagy and proteostasis in maintaining cochlear cell integrity. One of the strengths of trehalose is its ability to enhance autophagy through an mTOR-independent pathway, which specifically involves the activation and nuclear translocation of TFEB. This mechanism not only facilitates the clearance of damaged and aggregated proteins and mitochondria but also helps maintain membrane fluidity—an essential factor for the proper function of mechanotransduction channels in cochlear hair cells (Fu & Chai, 2019; Ege et al., 2024).

Additionally, trehalose has a well-established safety profile, partly because it has been used as a dietary supplement and excipient for many years, reducing the risk associated with early translational studies in ARHL. Its protective effects in models of neurodegenerative diseases, where proteostasis and autophagic dysfunction are central to the pathology, further support the hypothesis that it could be beneficial in the context of ARHL (Lotfi et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020).

However, several challenges remain. First, while there is abundant preclinical evidence of trehalose’s autophagy-inducing capacity in various neurodegenerative contexts, direct evidence in models of age-related hearing loss is sparse. Clinical trials specifically targeting ARHL using trehalose are lacking, and it remains to be seen whether the mechanisms observed in neuronal and other postmitotic cells are fully translatable to cochlear hair cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ege et al., 2024). Second, the optimal dosing, administration route (e.g., oral versus intravenous), and long-term safety profile specific to the auditory system require further investigation. The concentration of trehalose that effectively induces autophagy in vitro (e.g., 100 mM) may not directly translate into a feasible dosing regimen in vivo without further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies (Fu & Chai, 2019; Tavanai et al., 2024).

Moreover, while activation of TFEB is a promising mechanism for enhancing lysosomal and autophagic function, the complex interplay between autophagy, cellular senescence, and apoptosis in aging cochlear cells necessitates careful evaluation. Overactivation of autophagy could, under certain circumstances, lead to autophagic cell death if not properly regulated (Ege et al., 2024; He et al., 2021).

Another consideration is the long-term impact of trehalose on mitochondrial quality control. Since mitochondrial dysfunction is a major contributor to ARHL—with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative damage—the ability of trehalose to restore mitochondrial dynamics is of paramount importance. Evidence from related studies suggests that enhanced autophagy via TFEB activation promotes mitophagy and reduces oxidative stress (Li et al., 2023).

Finally, despite the strong theoretical foundation for repurposing trehalose in ARHL, the translation from cell culture and non-auditory models to preclinical animal models of hearing loss remains an essential step. The auditory system has unique physiological and biophysical characteristics; thus, demonstration of efficacy in an appropriate ARHL model is crucial to validate the hypothesis that trehalose can preserve mechanotransduction channel dynamics by maintaining membrane fluidity and cytoskeletal architecture (Ege et al., 2024; Tavanai et al., 2024).

In summary, the overall evaluation of trehalose as a therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss is promising. Its distinct mechanism of mTOR-independent autophagy enhancement via TFEB activation offers a targeted method to promote proteostasis, mitochondrial quality control, and the preservation of membrane fluidity in aging cochlear hair cells (Fu & Chai, 2019; Ege et al., 2024). The strengths of trehalose include its natural origin, excellent safety profile, and demonstrated efficacy in reducing protein aggregation and oxidative stress in multiple neurodegenerative models (Lotfi et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020). However, significant gaps remain in the direct application of trehalose to ARHL models, particularly regarding dosing, long-term safety in the auditory system, and the precise interplay of autophagic mechanisms in cochlear cells. Future research must focus on preclinical studies using appropriate animal models of ARHL, detailed analyses of mitochondrial and membrane biophysics in the cochlea, and eventually, clinical trials to establish its efficacy and safety for hearing preservation (Ege et al., 2024; Tavanai et al., 2024).

Overall, trehalose remains a strong candidate for repurposing to treat ARHL, but its translational potential will depend on bridging the gap between the promising molecular mechanisms observed in vitro and in non-auditory models, and robust preclinical and clinical evidence in auditory systems. This candidate merits further detailed investigation and could offer an innovative strategy for protecting cochlear hair cells from age-related degeneration through enhancement of autophagic clearance and maintenance of membrane dynamics (Ege et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2015).

AICAR,"Proposal for AICAR

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
AICAR (5‐aminoimidazole‐4‐carboxamide ribonucleotide) is an adenosine analog that was discovered in the early 1990s as a tool to probe cellular energy metabolism, and it has since been characterized as a cell‐permeable pharmacological activator of AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Višnjić et al., 2021). Chemically, AICAR is a ribonucleoside that, upon entering cells via adenosine transporters, is phosphorylated by adenosine kinase to yield ZMP (5‐aminoimidazole‐4‐carboxamide ribonucleotide, also known as AICA ribotide). ZMP mimics AMP in its structure and function; it binds to the γ‐subunit of AMPK, thereby causing allosteric activation, promoting phosphorylation at Thr172 (Green, 2013). This compound belongs to the class of nucleoside analogs and metabolic modulators which impact cellular energy homeostasis, and similar compounds in this line have been used in preclinical and clinical settings primarily for metabolic disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction. AICAR was originally synthesized and developed as a research tool, and over time its potential for therapeutic repurposing emerged as its profound impact on cellular energetics and mitochondrial quality control was elucidated (Višnjić et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, AICAR has been extensively studied in a variety of preclinical models focused on metabolic regulation and mitochondrial diseases. It has been used to probe the pathways involved in glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis in tissues such as skeletal muscle and the heart (Green, 2013). Clinical trials have investigated AICAR in conditions like type 2 diabetes, where its ability to acutely increase AMPK activity translates into improved glucose uptake and metabolic regulation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). For instance, an early clinical trial conducted by the Baker Heart Research Institute (Baker Heart Research Institute, 2002) evaluated AICAR’s impact on leg glucose uptake in diabetic patients, demonstrating that AICAR-induced AMPK activation leads to enhanced GLUT-4 translocation and improved metabolism in skeletal muscle (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, preclinical studies in models of mitochondrial myopathy demonstrated that sustained AICAR treatment improves mitochondrial function by increasing cytochrome c oxidase activity and even delaying disease onset through mechanisms that involve enhanced tissue regeneration (El-Hattab et al., 2017; Peralta et al., 2016). Although AICAR has not been directly used in clinical trials for Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL), its well-documented effects on AMPK activation and subsequent upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant responses are highly relevant to cochlear health. Studies in auditory research have noted that age-related declines in mitochondrial function and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) are hallmarks of cochlear degeneration (Ege et al., 2024), suggesting that a repurposed agent like AICAR might be effective in counteracting these cellular deficits.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, AICAR exerts its effects primarily by activating AMPK, the cell’s central metabolic sensor. Once phosphorylated intracellularly to ZMP, AICAR structurally mimics AMP and binds to the γ-subunit of AMPK, thereby relieving autoinhibition of the catalytic α-subunit and facilitating its phosphorylation at Thr172 by upstream kinases such as LKB1 (Višnjić et al., 2021; Green, 2013). This activation of AMPK triggers a cascade of downstream events. One of the most important downstream effects is the promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis through the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). PGC-1α is a master transcriptional coactivator that, when activated by AMPK, translocates to the nucleus and upregulates the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial replication and function (Cortada et al., 2021; Višnjić et al., 2021). Additionally, AMPK activation by AICAR leads to inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which simultaneously promotes autophagy and mitophagy. These processes are essential for the removal of damaged organelles, particularly mitochondria, thereby reducing oxidative stress and preserving cellular function (Green, 2013; Moore et al., 2020). In tissues with high metabolic demand such as cochlear hair cells, this regulation is essential to maintain ATP levels needed for Ca²⁺-dependent processes like the operation of plasma membrane Ca²⁺ pumps (PMCA) and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase (SERCA), which in turn modulate mechanotransduction channel gating (Ege et al., 2024).

Beyond its effect on AMPK, AICAR exhibits several AMPK-independent actions. At high intracellular concentrations, AICAR (or its metabolite ZMP) can interact with other AMP-sensitive enzymes. These interactions include modulation of nucleotide synthesis pathways, where interference with enzymes such as UMP synthase can affect pyrimidine synthesis and cell proliferation (Višnjić et al., 2021). These off-target effects, while sometimes contributing to its antitumor activities (as seen in various cancer models), are generally secondary to its metabolic actions in the context of energy homeostasis. The delicate balance between its AMPK-dependent and independent effects ultimately influences its overall therapeutic potential and limits, making dosing and route of administration critical considerations in any translation to new applications such as ARHL (Višnjić et al., 2021; Moore et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
For Age-Related Hearing Loss, the current hypothesis is that AICAR will restore the energy balance in cochlear hair cells by activating AMPK, leading to the following expected beneficial outcomes:
1. Enhanced Mitochondrial Biogenesis: Activation of AMPK by AICAR is anticipated to lead to increased phosphorylation and activation of PGC-1α, which in turn promotes mitochondrial replication and function. Given that studies in various models have shown upregulation of mitochondrial markers and improved oxidative capacity following AICAR treatment (Cortada et al., 2021; Peralta et al., 2016), similar results might be expected in aged cochlear explants where mitochondrial dysfunction is a common occurrence in ARHL. Increased mitochondrial biogenesis would boost ATP production necessary for maintaining proper ion gradients, ensuring that mechanotransduction channels operate efficiently (Cortada et al., 2021).

2. Reduction in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS): Mitochondrial dysfunction in aging cochlear cells leads to an accumulation of ROS, which damages cellular components and accelerates hair cell loss. By activating AMPK, AICAR is expected to reduce ROS levels indirectly through improved mitochondrial turnover and by upregulation of antioxidant defenses, as has been demonstrated in neuronal cultures using AICAR–a finding that is supportive of its potential in mitigating oxidative stress in the inner ear (Hu & Ma, 2021; Ege et al., 2024). Reduced oxidative stress would help in preserving the integrity and function of cochlear hair cells and supporting cells.

3. Preservation of ATP-Dependent Processes: The cochlear hair cell function depends crucially on the energy provided by mitochondria to support ATP-dependent processes such as Ca²⁺ pumping by PMCA and SERCA, which are essential for rapid adaptation of the mechanotransduction (MET) channels (Ege et al., 2024; Cortada et al., 2021). Since ARHL is characterized by a decline in ATP levels due to mitochondrial inefficiency, activation of AMPK by AICAR would help in restoring energy levels, thereby maintaining Ca²⁺ homeostasis and proper mechanotransduction kinetics. In vitro assays using aged cochlear explants have demonstrated deficits in mechanotransduction that correlate with reduced AMPK activity, and preliminary evidence suggests that AICAR at 500 μM can increase AMPK phosphorylation and upregulate PGC-1α, offering a mechanistic basis for these expected benefits (Ege et al., 2024; Cortada et al., 2021).

4. Support of Cellular Homeostasis and Cell Survival: By promoting both mitochondrial regeneration and autophagy, AICAR helps the cell eliminate damaged organelles, thereby reducing the triggers for apoptosis. In the context of cochlear aging, where cellular damage and apoptosis contribute to progressive hearing loss, AMPK activation can tilt the balance towards maintenance of cellular integrity and function (Hill, 2015; Hu & Ma, 2021). This dual effect not only improves the metabolic capacity but also contributes to the structural preservation of the efferent synaptic connections necessary for hearing.

Overall Evaluation:
AICAR presents as a promising repurposed candidate for ARHL for several reasons. First, its molecular mechanism is well understood: by activating AMPK, AICAR stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1α, improves cellular energy homeostasis, and induces protective autophagy pathways that are crucial for combating oxidative stress (Green, 2013; Višnjić et al., 2021). These mechanisms address the central pathophysiological features of ARHL, namely mitochondrial dysfunction, energy depletion, and oxidative cellular damage (Ege et al., 2024).

Strengths of AICAR include its water solubility and cell permeability, advantageous properties that support its use in ex vivo and in vivo models, as well as its already established safety profile in several clinical studies for metabolic diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Baker Heart Research Institute, 2002). The compound has been extensively studied in varied systems such as muscle, cardiac tissue, and neuronal cultures, thereby providing a robust background of data supporting its potential to restore energy balance in high metabolic demand cells like cochlear hair cells (El-Hattab et al., 2017; Peralta et al., 2016). Moreover, data from recent auditory research indicates that reduced AMPK activity correlates with functional deficits in mechanotransduction in aged cochlear explants (Ege et al., 2024), which supports the rationale for an AMPK activator to reverse such deficits.

However, several challenges and weaknesses must be considered. AICAR, though effective in preclinical models, has demonstrated complex pharmacodynamics due to its AMPK-independent effects at high intracellular concentrations, which may result in unintended metabolic disturbances (Višnjić et al., 2021; Moore et al., 2020). Optimization of dose, timing, and targeted delivery is critical to ensure that the beneficial effects on mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative stress reduction are not counterbalanced by off-target or pro-apoptotic actions. Furthermore, direct evidence of AICAR’s protective effects in cochlear hair cells remains limited in the literature; most studies have focused on its role in muscle, cardiac, and cancer cells (Hill, 2015; Hu & Ma, 2021). Therefore, dedicated preclinical studies using aged cochlear explants and in vivo animal models specific to ARHL will be necessary to validate its efficacy and to determine the optimal therapeutic window. Lastly, potential pharmacokinetic challenges related to achieving sufficient local concentrations in the inner ear, given the presence of the blood-labyrinth barrier, must be addressed to ensure effective drug delivery (Wu et al., 2023; Okur & Djalilian, 2022).

In summary, AICAR exhibits a robust mechanism of action as an AMPK activator that enhances mitochondrial function, reduces oxidative stress, and supports energy-dependent cellular processes in high-demand cells such as cochlear hair cells. The expected effects in restoring proper mechanotransduction and protecting against oxidative and metabolic stress make it a compelling candidate for ARHL treatment (Cortada et al., 2021; Ege et al., 2024). Its prior therapeutic history in metabolic and mitochondrial diseases provides a foundation for repurposing, although direct application in hearing loss must be further substantiated through focused experimental studies. Overall, while AICAR shows significant promise, its complex bioactivity mandates rigorous preclinical evaluation to optimize its pharmacodynamics and delivery specifically for age-related cochlear protection before advancing to clinical trials for ARHL (Green, 2013; Peralta et al., 2016).

Rolipram,"Proposal for Rolipram

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rolipram is a synthetic small‐molecule drug that serves as a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase‐4 (PDE4), a key enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in various cell types. Rolipram was originally discovered in the early 1980s, emerging from extensive pharmacological investigations into PDEs, and rapidly established itself as the prototypical PDE4 inhibitor due to its high selectivity for the PDE4 enzyme family (Neale, 2012). Structurally, rolipram belongs to the class of PDE4 inhibitors, compounds that have been widely studied for their capacity to elevate intracellular cAMP levels by blocking its degradation; this cascade is crucial for modulating inflammatory responses, neuronal plasticity, and cell survival. The compound is well known for its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, a property that has allowed it to be tested in various central nervous system (CNS) indications such as depression, cognitive impairment, and neurodegenerative diseases (Schudt et al., 2011). As a member of the PDE4 inhibitor class, rolipram shares several common features with its successors and analogues in its ability to modulate cellular signaling via cAMP, but it is historically noted for both its potent biochemical activity and a challenging tolerability profile due to side effects such as nausea and emesis. Given its extensive history and proven bioactivity in modulating cAMP-dependent pathways, rolipram has been proposed for repurposing as a therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss (ARHL) based on the rationale that increasing cAMP levels in cochlear cells could counteract inflammation-driven degeneration; this candidate hypothesis focuses on elevating cAMP in cochlear hair cells and supporting cells, thereby activating protein kinase A (PKA)–mediated phosphorylation of CREB, suppressing NF-κB signaling and ultimately reducing inflammatory damage that contributes to mechanotransduction (MET) channel downregulation in aged ears (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Rolipram’s therapeutic history spans several decades of preclinical and early clinical testing, primarily in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative contexts. In the past, rolipram was explored for its antidepressant effects and as a potential neuroprotective agent in models of spinal cord injury, Alzheimer’s disease, and other conditions characterized by excessive inflammation and neuronal loss (Schudt et al., 2011; Hemachandran et al., 2024). Preclinical studies using animal models have demonstrated the efficacy of rolipram in raising intracellular cAMP levels, thereby activating downstream PKA signaling and promoting CREB phosphorylation; these events are well known to support neuronal survival, axonal regeneration, and synaptic plasticity (Kranz et al., 2014; Hemachandran, 2019). In the context of hearing research specifically, although direct clinical trial data remain sparse—as evidenced by a recent search on ClinicalTrials.gov showing no listed trials for rolipram in hearing disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—a number of preclinical studies have investigated rolipram in cochlear explant models and animal studies related to synaptic regeneration after noise-induced injury (Hemachandran, 2019; Hemachandran et al., 2024). These studies indicate that rolipram can promote the regeneration of afferent synapses connecting inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), a process likely mediated through cAMP/PKA signaling pathways. Additionally, related literature on PDE4 inhibitors has demonstrated their anti-inflammatory capabilities in other models ranging from central nervous system lesions to autoimmune disorders (Crocetti et al., 2022), thereby providing supplementary evidence of their potential benefits in inflammatory conditions that could extend to the cochlea. Overall, while rolipram has not yet been used in clinical settings specifically targeting ARHL, its preclinical profile—spanning both central and peripheral neural protection—provides a strong rationale for further investigation as a repurposed therapeutic candidate in the field of hearing loss.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, rolipram exerts its pharmacological effects by selectively inhibiting PDE4, thereby preventing the hydrolysis of cAMP into its inactive form, 5’AMP. The resultant increase in intracellular cAMP concentrations triggers the activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates various substrates including the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) (Kranz et al., 2014; Hemachandran et al., 2024). This phosphorylation of CREB is particularly important because it enhances the transcription of genes associated with cell survival, neurotrophism, and anti-apoptotic signaling. Another key aspect of rolipram’s mechanism is its ability to downregulate proinflammatory signaling pathways. Elevated cAMP levels result in the suppression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity, a pivotal transcription factor involved in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β (Crocetti et al., 2022; Heckman et al., 2015). This dual action—upregulation of neuroprotective gene expression via the PKA/CREB axis and simultaneous inhibition of NF-κB–mediated proinflammatory cytokine transcription—forms the biochemical basis by which rolipram can reduce inflammation. In the context of cochlear cells, which include sensory hair cells, supporting cells, and spiral ganglion neurons, these intracellular signaling pathways are essential not only for maintaining synaptic function and cell viability but also for preserving the function and expression of ion channels critical for mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) (Hemachandran, 2019; Kranz et al., 2014). Increased levels of cAMP in these cell types are expected to enhance the structural and functional integrity of the actin cytoskeleton, facilitate synaptic repair, and counteract the age-related downregulation of ion channels necessary for proper auditory transduction. Together, these molecular interactions provide a compelling mechanistic rationale for the use of rolipram in mitigating the deleterious effects of cochlear inflammaging, a process characterized by chronic, low-grade inflammation that contributes to age-related hearing loss (Bazard et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
Based on its well-documented mechanism of action, rolipram is hypothesized to elicit several beneficial effects in the cochlea that might counteract the pathophysiology of ARHL. First, by inhibiting PDE4 and elevating intracellular cAMP levels, rolipram is expected to activate PKA, resulting in the phosphorylation of CREB. Enhanced CREB activity will stimulate the transcription of genes involved in cellular survival and synaptogenesis, which may promote the regeneration of cochlear synapses that are typically compromised by chronic noise exposure and aging (Hemachandran et al., 2024; Hemachandran, 2019). The elevation of cAMP will also have an anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing NF-κB signaling and reducing the local production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β—cytokines that are elevated in aged cochlear tissues and contribute to the dysregulation of ion channel expression and function (Crocetti et al., 2022; Bazard et al., 2021). Specifically, the reduction in these inflammatory mediators is anticipated to spare the normal expression and function of MET channels, which are critical for translating mechanical sound vibrations into neural signals; this is particularly important since inflammation-driven MET channel downregulation is one of the contributors to the progressive loss of auditory sensitivity observed in ARHL. Moreover, the enhancement of cytoskeletal dynamics via CREB-dependent transcription may further contribute to the stabilization of hair cell and supporting cell architecture, thereby preserving the overall mechanical and electrical integrity of the cochlear sensory epithelium (Heckman et al., 2015). Preclinical studies in rodent models have suggested that systemic administration of rolipram at doses around 0.5 mg/kg can increase cochlear cAMP levels and promote regenerative responses, although precise dosing regimens and effects on the aged cochlea remain to be fully defined (Hemachandran et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Therefore, the expected overall effect of rolipram in an assay designed for ARHL would include enhanced synaptic repair, reduced inflammatory cytokine expression, preservation of MET channel function, and ultimately stabilization or improvement of auditory function in aged ears.

Overall Evaluation:
Evaluating rolipram as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss reveals a blend of promising molecular rationale with certain translational challenges that must be addressed in further research. One of the major strengths of rolipram is its well-characterized mechanism of action. As a prototypical PDE4 inhibitor, rolipram has been shown across multiple studies to elevate intracellular cAMP levels, thereby activating the PKA/CREB signaling cascade that promotes neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity (Kranz et al., 2014; Hemachandran et al., 2024). This increase in cAMP is also associated with the suppression of proinflammatory NF-κB signaling and the subsequent reduction in cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β, which are critical mediators of chronic inflammation in aging tissues—including the cochlea (Crocetti et al., 2022; Bazard et al., 2021). Given that inflammation and dysregulation of ion channel expression play a pivotal role in the deterioration of auditory function with age, rolipram’s ability to modulate these cellular processes positions it as a highly attractive candidate for combating the mechanisms underlying ARHL.

Moreover, several preclinical studies, including work on cochlear explants and noise-induced synaptopathy models, provide encouraging evidence that PDE4 inhibition with rolipram can promote synaptic regeneration and functional recovery in auditory circuits (Hemachandran, 2019; Hemachandran et al., 2024). Additionally, its CNS-permeant properties and the feasibility of systemic administration are advantageous for non-invasive delivery to the inner ear, an important consideration given the challenges associated with direct cochlear drug delivery (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Taken together, these features underscore rolipram’s potential to not only protect cochlear cells from inflammatory damage but also to actively promote repair mechanisms that could mitigate the progression of ARHL.

However, there are notable weaknesses and challenges that temper this optimism. Historically, rolipram has been associated with a narrow therapeutic window due to significant side effects such as nausea and emesis, which have limited its clinical utility in CNS disorders (Schudt et al., 2011; Neale, 2012). The same side-effect profile could potentially limit its use as a long-term therapy in elderly populations if systemic exposure is not carefully managed. Furthermore, although there is promising preclinical evidence in non-cochlear systems and some indirect data from cochlear models, direct clinical evidence or dedicated in vivo studies specifically addressing the impact of rolipram on age-related cochlear dysfunction are still lacking (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kranz et al., 2014). There is also the challenge of ensuring that the effective concentrations required to achieve cochlear anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects are safely attainable without provoking systemic adverse effects.

Another consideration is the complexity of the inflammatory processes in the aged cochlea. Recent studies have highlighted the multifactorial nature of cochlear inflammaging, involving mitochondrial dysfunction, ion channel dysregulation, and the activation of inflammasomes (Bazard et al., 2021). While rolipram’s modulation of cAMP/PKA/CREB and NF-κB pathways is well established, it remains to be fully elucidated how these effects translate to the intricate microenvironment of the aging cochlea, where interactions among hair cells, supporting cells, and neural components are critical. It will be important to establish not only that rolipram can elevate cAMP in these specific cell types but also that such elevation translates to measurable improvements in ion channel function—for instance, by preserving the normal activity of MET channels, which are essential for mechanotransduction (Hemachandran et al., 2024).

Despite these challenges, strategies to overcome rolipram’s limitations are available. For instance, formulation approaches such as targeted delivery via lipidic nanocapsules have been explored to enhance drug uptake into cochlear cells while minimizing systemic exposure and side effects (Meyer et al., 2012). Such targeted delivery systems could prove particularly useful in the context of ARHL, where localization of the therapeutic effect to the inner ear might allow for lower overall dosing and improved tolerability. Additionally, the development of next-generation PDE4 inhibitors with improved selectivity profiles (minimizing PDE4D-mediated emesis while retaining PDE4B inhibition) may offer a way to harness the beneficial effects of rolipram’s mechanism without incurring its most problematic side effects (Crocetti et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2013).

In summary, the overall evaluation of rolipram as a therapeutic candidate for ARHL is cautiously optimistic. On the strength side, rolipram has a robust and well-documented mechanism of action involving the elevation of intracellular cAMP, activation of the PKA/CREB axis, and concomitant suppression of proinflammatory NF-κB signaling—key pathways that are implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related cochlear degeneration and the downregulation of critical ion channels such as those involved in MET (Kranz et al., 2014; Hemachandran et al., 2024; Bazard et al., 2021). Preclinical data, including studies on synaptic regeneration in cochlear explants and noise-induced injury models, support the notion that PDE4 inhibition can be beneficial for auditory function. Rolipram’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and be administered systemically further enhances its appeal as a minimally invasive therapeutic option. On the weakness side, the historical clinical limitations related to side effects such as nausea and emesis, the lack of direct clinical data in ARHL populations, and the need for optimized, localized cochlear delivery present significant challenges that must be addressed before rolipram can be considered a viable long-term treatment for age-related hearing loss (Schudt et al., 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Thus, while rolipram presents a compelling biochemical rationale and comes with encouraging preclinical evidence with regard to its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective actions in various neural tissues, its application in ARHL will require further dedicated studies. Specifically, there is a need for detailed in vivo investigations in aged animal models that elucidate rolipram’s effect on cochlear cAMP levels, downstream PKA/CREB signaling, preservation of MET channel expression, and overall auditory function. Additionally, exploring advanced drug delivery systems to restrict rolipram’s action to the inner ear could mitigate systemic side effects and improve its tolerability profile in the elderly. If these challenges can be overcome, rolipram or its next-generation analogues might emerge as promising candidates for slowing or reversing the progression of ARHL, addressing a significant unmet medical need in our aging population.

Overall, the strategic repurposing of rolipram for age-related hearing loss is supported by a strong mechanistic foundation and encouraging preclinical data, though clinical translation will depend on overcoming its historical side-effect challenges and validating its efficacy in cochlear-specific contexts. Further research, including rigorous preclinical studies with targeted delivery approaches, is warranted before advancing into human clinical trials.

Fisetin,"Proposal for Fisetin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fisetin is a naturally occurring flavonol found in a variety of fruits and vegetables such as strawberries, apples, and onions. It belongs to the flavonoid class of polyphenolic compounds that have been widely investigated for their antioxidant and senolytic properties. Fisetin was initially discovered through phytochemical studies and later isolated for its potential to modulate cellular aging. As a senolytic, fisetin has been shown to selectively eliminate senescent cells in various tissues in rodent models, while its antioxidant properties contribute to the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitigation of oxidative damage. This dual functionality—senolysis and antioxidation—is the hallmark of its class; other flavonols have been used in diverse experimental settings to modulate aging and inflammation in preclinical studies (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 26–27; Castañeda et al., 2019, pp. 5–8).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, flavonols such as quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin have been explored in both clinical and experimental contexts for a range of age-related disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and vascular dysfunction. Fisetin, in particular, has been evaluated in aged rodent models where oral administration at doses between 20 and 50 mg/kg led to a reduction in senescence markers like p16^INK4a and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) in multiple organs. Although there are no reported clinical trials or registered studies directly evaluating fisetin for age-related hearing loss (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), its pharmacological profile provides a strong rationale for repurposing this compound in auditory research. Previous evidence from related flavonols in traditional oriental medicine indicates that compounds with similar antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms contribute to protecting cochlear structures and preserving hearing function (Castañeda et al., 2019, pp. 24–28; Ege et al., 2024, pp. 3–6).

Mechanism of Action:
Fisetin exerts its effects through multiple mechanisms at the molecular level. Foremost, it acts as a senolytic by targeting and clearing senescent cells. Senescent cells accumulate in aging tissues and secrete a pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that disrupts normal tissue homeostasis. In animal models, fisetin administration has been observed to reduce the expression of senescence markers, which is associated with a decrease in inflammatory cytokines. This is particularly relevant for the aging cochlea, where inflammation and disrupted ion channel function contribute to the deterioration of mechanotransduction.
In parallel, fisetin is a potent antioxidant that directly scavenges reactive oxygen species. The accumulation of ROS in cochlear hair cells leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and subsequent apoptotic cell death. By reducing ROS levels, fisetin helps to maintain cellular membrane integrity and preserves the structure and function of hair cell stereocilia that house the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channels critical for auditory function. Its ability to modulate pathways involving NRF2, SIRT1, and the PI3K/Akt axis has been reported in other tissues, suggesting that similar protective molecular interactions could occur in cochlear cells (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 26–27; Koo et al., 2024, pp. 16–17).
Moreover, fisetin’s senolytic action is thought to indirectly improve the antioxidant defense system by eliminating cells that contribute disproportionally to inflammation and oxidative stress. This clearance of dysfunctional senescent supporting cells in the cochlea could reduce the release of SASP factors that interfere with the expression of ion channels and alter membrane lipid composition, thereby preserving the delicate balance required for efficient mechanotransduction (Yang et al., 2022, pp. 12–13; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 15–16).

Expected Effect:
In the context of age-related hearing loss, the expected outcome of fisetin treatment is multifaceted. By clearing senescent cells from the cochlea, fisetin should reduce the local burden of inflammatory cytokines and SASP mediators that disrupt cochlear homeostasis and impair the function of supporting cells. This, in turn, would help maintain the structural integrity of the cochlear sensory epithelium and preserve the function of hair cells. The antioxidant properties of fisetin are anticipated to protect the hair cell stereocilia from ROS-mediated damage, thereby stabilizing the MET channels and ensuring proper ion channel gating and membrane integrity. The expected biochemical effects include reduced expression of pro-inflammatory markers, decreased lipid peroxidation in cochlear membranes, and restoration of mitochondrial function in hair cells and supporting cells. These outcomes are based on the broader literature indicating that modulation of oxidative stress and cellular senescence is critical for delaying cochlear degeneration (Paciello et al., 2023, pp. 16–18; Teraoka et al., 2024, pp. 9–10).
Molecular targets relevant in the auditory system include the expression of SIRT1 and SIRT3 in both hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons, as these sirtuins have been strongly associated with protecting against oxidative stress and apoptosis in cochlear tissues. Fisetin’s previously demonstrated impact on these pathways supports its anticipated role in preserving mechanotransduction in the inner ear (Koo et al., 2024, pp. 4–5; Ege et al., 2024, pp. 11–13).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on a comprehensive review of the literature, fisetin shows significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss. The strengths of fisetin lie in its dual mechanism of action; it not only functions as a senolytic agent capable of clearing detrimental senescent cells but also exhibits robust antioxidant properties that can mitigate ROS-induced damage. These mechanisms are highly relevant to the pathophysiological processes observed in the aging cochlea, where cellular senescence, SASP-mediated inflammation, and oxidative stress play major roles in the deterioration of auditory function. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic profile evidenced by efficacious dosing in rodent models (20–50 mg/kg orally) adds to its translational potential for further preclinical studies.
However, there are some weaknesses to consider. Direct evidence for fisetin’s efficacy specifically in models of hearing loss remains sparse, and no clinical trials currently evaluate its use in auditory degeneration (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while the biochemical framework is promising, the inner ear presents unique challenges regarding drug delivery and bioavailability, especially in targeting the cochlear microenvironment without off-target effects. There may also be concerns related to the optimal dosing required to achieve sufficient senolytic and antioxidant effects in the cochlea compared to other organs. Despite these challenges, parallels drawn from studies on related flavonols and senolytics in age-related diseases provide a mechanistic rationale that supports further investigation. Overall, fisetin represents a compelling candidate for the treatment of age-related hearing loss, warranting additional preclinical validation and more targeted in vitro and in vivo studies to elucidate its specific effects on cochlear tissue homeostasis and mechanotransduction integrity (Ege et al., 2024, pp. 26–27; Castañeda et al., 2019, pp. 24–28; Koo et al., 2024, pp. 22–23).

CDN1163,"Proposal for CDN1163

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
CDN1163 is a synthetically derived small-molecule drug belonging to the quinoline‐amide class of compounds that was discovered through high‐throughput screening methodologies employing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays designed to identify direct activators of SERCA (the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺‐ATPase). This molecule specifically targets SERCA2 isoforms and has been demonstrated to activate the ATPase activity of SERCA across multiple isoforms, including SERCA1a, SERCA2a, and SERCA2b. Its chemical structure, characterized by a quinoline core with amide substitutions, confers favorable cell permeability, metabolic stability, and a lack of significant off‐target activities on other ion channels, as established in several biochemical studies (Sordi et al., 2021). The general class of small-molecule SERCA activators has been explored predominantly in the context of cardiac and metabolic diseases, where increasing intracellular Ca²⁺ reuptake into the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) improves Ca²⁺ homeostasis and alleviates ER stress. Typically, drug candidates in this class have been screened for their ability to enhance ATP-dependent Ca²⁺ transport and to potentially reverse pathological conditions associated with Ca²⁺ dysregulation (Kang et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
The utilization of SERCA activators as therapeutic agents has been mostly centered around cardiovascular and metabolic indications. For example, compounds such as istaroxime have been studied to stimulate SERCA2a in the heart to improve contractility and relaxation in heart failure. Additionally, pyridone derivatives and other allosteric modulators have shown promise in preclinical models of diabetes and metabolic syndrome by reducing ER stress and correcting Ca²⁺ handling deficits. CDN1163 in particular has been demonstrated to significantly stimulate SERCA ATPase activity in native microsomal preparations and reconstituted proteoliposomes, with an effective concentration (EC₅₀) in the micromolar range (approximately 6 μM) and a reproducible enhancement of Ca²⁺ transport even under physiologically low Ca²⁺ conditions (Sordi et al., 2021). Although the clinical trial search using keywords “CDN1163 OR SERCA2 activator OR ATP2A2 AND hearing loss OR auditory OR cochlea” returned thousands of studies that underscore the extensive clinical interest in modulating SERCA2 for multiple disease contexts, direct clinical or preclinical evidence related to Age‐Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) is limited (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In the auditory field, there is emerging evidence that SERCA2 is expressed in cochlear hair cells and that its dysfunction may contribute to intracellular Ca²⁺ dysregulation associated with age-related degeneration (Li et al., 2018; Pinheiro et al., 2021). However, while SERCA activators have shown promise in other systems, there is as yet no comprehensive history of their direct use in hearing loss, with most evidence coming from mechanistic studies and analogies drawn from cardiac and metabolic models.

Mechanism of Action:
CDN1163 functions by directly binding to SERCA enzymes within the lipid bilayer of the ER/SR membranes. Mechanistic studies indicate that it interacts at a site likely located in the transmembrane domain of SERCA, where its lipophilic character enables it to stably associate with the membrane environment and modulate the protein’s conformation (Sordi et al., 2021; Seflova et al., 2024). Once bound, CDN1163 increases the ATPase activity of SERCA, thereby enhancing the rate of Ca²⁺ translocation from the cytoplasm into the ER. This improved Ca²⁺ uptake has been quantified as a roughly 30% increase in SERCA’s maximal activity under saturating Ca²⁺ conditions, with an observed potentiation even at low physiological Ca²⁺ concentrations (Sordi et al., 2021). The compound’s action is reversible, suggesting that its modulatory effects are allosteric rather than due to permanent modification of the enzyme. Importantly, studies have demonstrated that CDN1163 does not disrupt the functional interaction between SERCA and its endogenous regulatory proteins such as phospholamban (PLN), which is critical for maintaining precise control over Ca²⁺ cycling in tissues like the heart (Sordi et al., 2021). By promoting a conformational state of SERCA that favors Ca²⁺ binding and subsequent transport, CDN1163 accelerates the clearance of cytosolic Ca²⁺ and mitigates ER stress—a process that is critical in preventing cellular dysfunction in conditions marked by Ca²⁺ overload (Rahate et al., 2020).

At the molecular level, the compound exhibits a Hill coefficient near 3, which implies cooperative binding dynamics, possibly indicating the involvement of multiple binding sites or a conformationally sensitive transition within the SERCA protein. This cooperative binding contributes to the robust activation of SERCA activity, even at micromolar levels of CDN1163 (Sordi et al., 2021). Structurally, the binding of CDN1163 is thought to stabilize an “active” conformation of the SERCA enzyme, thereby lowering the activation energy for the conformational changes required for Ca²⁺ transport. This mechanism contrasts with traditional inhibitors of SERCA such as thapsigargin, which block the pump’s activity by binding to its Ca²⁺-binding sites and preventing Ca²⁺ translocation (Rahate et al., 2020; Seflova et al., 2024). Moreover, the compound’s supportive data from fluorescence-based assays provide evidence that the stereochemistry and lipophilic attributes of CDN1163 are crucial for its effective penetration of the lipid bilayer and subsequent engagement with the SERCA protein (Aguayo-Ortiz et al., 2021).

Expected Effect in the Assay and on Hair Cell Function:
The working hypothesis for employing CDN1163 as a therapeutic agent in Age-Related Hearing Loss is predicated on its capacity to enhance ER Ca²⁺ uptake and thereby improve intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis in cochlear hair cells. Aging hair cells are known to accumulate Ca²⁺ dysregulation due to a decline in the activity of Ca²⁺ extrusion mechanisms, such as PMCA2; to some extent, this is compensated by an upregulation of SERCA expression, although insufficient activity can still lead to Ca²⁺ overload and subsequent cellular stress (Pinheiro et al., 2021). In this context, CDN1163 is expected to robustly stimulate the SERCA2 isoform present in the ER of hair cells, accelerating the reuptake of Ca²⁺ from the cytosol. This action is anticipated to lower the amplitude of cytosolic Ca²⁺ transients during mechanotransduction, thereby preventing the deleterious downstream signaling cascades that lead to hair cell death and MET (mechanotransduction) channel adaptation failure. Indeed, evidence from biochemical studies shows that CDN1163 can lower cytosolic Ca²⁺ peaks through enhanced SERCA activity at concentrations around 10 μM (Sordi et al., 2021).

In the proposed assay, hair cells derived from aged animal models (or relevant in vitro hair cell models) would be treated with CDN1163 to evaluate its effect on intracellular Ca²⁺ dynamics, using Ca²⁺-sensitive dyes or genetically encoded calcium indicators. It is expected that treated cells will demonstrate reduced cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels and a restoration of normal Ca²⁺ transient kinetics, which are critical for maintaining the proper operation and adaptation of MET channels (Murtha et al., 2024; Dörje, 2024). Given the central role of Ca²⁺ in supporting mechanotransduction and synaptic transmission in hair cells, improved Ca²⁺ handling mediated by CDN1163 is also predicted to preserve the integrity of mechanotransduction currents that typically decline with age. Additionally, because intracellular Ca²⁺ overload is a known trigger for ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), enhanced SERCA activity is likely to reduce ER stress markers and slow down the degenerative progression in the cochlear sensory epithelium (Li et al., 2018).

The expression of SERCA2 in cochlear hair cells is supported by literature, and several studies have indicated that ER Ca²⁺ regulation is critical for hair cell survival. Although direct studies with CDN1163 in auditory models remain limited, the mechanism of action observed in cardiac and hepatic models can be extrapolated to suggest that SERCA2 activation in the cochlea may similarly improve Ca²⁺ homeostasis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Therefore, by lowering cytosolic Ca²⁺ peaks and normalizing the intracellular Ca²⁺ levels, CDN1163 could prevent the Ca²⁺ overload that contributes to MET channel dysfunction and eventual hair cell apoptosis, resulting in the preservation of hearing function despite the aging process.

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, CDN1163 is a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate that demonstrates significant potential for the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss based on its mechanistic role in restoring intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis. One of the primary strengths of CDN1163 is its direct and selective activation of SERCA2, which is pivotal for Ca²⁺ reuptake into the ER—a process that is compromised in aging hair cells due to decreased PMCA2 activity and other age-related alterations in Ca²⁺ handling (Sordi et al., 2021; Pinheiro et al., 2021). Its ability to stimulate SERCA activity in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner, while maintaining the integrity of SERCA’s interaction with its regulatory proteins, suggests that it is capable of enhancing Ca²⁺ clearance without disrupting normal cellular signaling pathways (Sordi et al., 2021; Rahate et al., 2020).

In terms of therapeutic history, while CDN1163 has been predominantly evaluated in the context of cardiac and metabolic dysfunction, extensive preclinical pharmacological studies have provided robust support for its capability to modulate intracellular Ca²⁺ levels effectively (Kang et al., 2016; Dahl et al., 2023). Although there is limited direct clinical or preclinical evidence in auditory models, the large number of related clinical trials targeting SERCA2 processes (as indicated by search queries) reflects a strong interest and potential for SERCA modulation across various disease contexts, including those affecting sensory systems. This translational potential, coupled with the mechanistic rationale that improved ER Ca²⁺ uptake can stabilize MET currents and protect hair cells from Ca²⁺ overload-induced degeneration, makes CDN1163 a compelling candidate for further investigation in ARHL (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Furthermore, the biochemical data indicating that CDN1163 enhances ATP-dependent Ca²⁺ transport with high potency (EC₅₀ around 6 μM) and demonstrates cooperative binding dynamics is suggestive of therapeutic efficacy at achievable dosing concentrations (Sordi et al., 2021; Seflova et al., 2024). Its favorable properties, including high membrane permeability and minimal off-target effects, further bolster its profile as a drug candidate for repurposing. One potential weakness, however, is the current paucity of direct auditory research that examines the effects of CDN1163 on cochlear hair cell Ca²⁺ homeostasis and mechanotransduction. While the extrapolation from cardiac and metabolic studies is promising, targeted in vitro and in vivo experiments in auditory cells will be critical to validate the hypothesis that SERCA2 activation can indeed preserve MET currents and prevent ARHL (Li et al., 2024; Park et al., 2024).

Another consideration is the need to establish a detailed pharmacokinetic and safety profile for CDN1163 in the context of the inner ear. Although its safety has been suggested in other models—particularly in terms of lacking cardiotoxicity such as hERG channel inhibition—specific evaluations in cochlear tissues are necessary to rule out potential ototoxicity or off-target effects on other ion channels critical for auditory function (Aguayo-Ortiz et al., 2021; Rahate et al., 2020).

In summary, CDN1163 represents a strong candidate for repurposing as a treatment for Age-Related Hearing Loss. Its mechanism—enhancing SERCA2-mediated Ca²⁺ uptake to stabilize intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis—directly addresses one of the molecular underpinnings of hair cell degeneration, namely, the failure of Ca²⁺ regulation leading to MET adaptation failure and cytotoxic cascades. The existing preclinical data in non-auditory tissues, combined with supportive evidence regarding the importance of Ca²⁺ handling in cochlear function, provide a robust rationale for advancing this compound into further auditory-specific studies. The strengths of CDN1163 lie in its potent, direct, and selective activation of SERCA as well as its favorable pharmacological profile, whereas its weaknesses include the current lack of direct experimental evidence in auditory models and the need for thorough in vivo safety and pharmacokinetic analyses in the inner ear. Ultimately, further detailed studies—both in vitro using hair cell assays and in vivo in animal models of ARHL—will be essential to fully validate its therapeutic potential for preserving mechanotransduction currents and preventing age-related auditory decline (Dörje, 2024; Li et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Capsazepine,"Proposal for Capsazepine

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Capsazepine is a synthetic analogue derived from capsaicin, originally developed to inhibit the activity of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptor. As a member of the vanilloid receptor antagonists, capsazepine specifically belongs to a class of compounds designed to block capsaicin-induced activation of TRPV1 channels (Steyger, 2003; Yang et al., 2019). Its chemical synthesis capitalized on the known structure–activity relationships of capsaicin analogues, leading to a compound that competitively antagonizes TRPV1 while exhibiting a pharmacological profile that can also affect other ion channels under certain conditions (Yamamura et al., 2004). Historically, this class of compounds has been extensively used in pain research and neurophysiology studies, owing to their ability to modulate calcium (Ca²⁺) influx in sensory neurons and thereby inhibit neurogenic inflammation, a mechanism that has prompted interest in their application to other conditions characterized by pathological Ca²⁺ entry (Steyger, 2003).

Therapeutic History:
Capsazepine’s primary use to date has been in preclinical research models focusing on pain, inflammation, and ototoxicity. In the auditory system, for example, it has been widely employed as an experimental tool in inner ear preparations to block the effects of capsaicin and resiniferatoxin on cochlear TRPV1 channels, thereby modulating cochlear sensitivity (Steyger, 2003; Zheng et al., 2003). Studies using capsazepine in animal models have demonstrated its capacity to prevent capsaicin-mediated reductions in cochlear microphonic potentials and to normalize parameters such as evoked otoacoustic emissions by antagonizing TRPV1 activation in outer hair cells, which are critical for auditory amplification (Steyger, 2003; Zheng et al., 2003). More recently, TRPV1 antagonism has been proposed as a strategy to combat ototoxicity induced by drugs such as cisplatin, where excessive TRPV1 activation contributes to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell death; silencing TRPV1 with either capsazepine or siRNA has been shown to protect cochlear hair cells in these models (Mukherjea et al., 2008; Mukherjea et al., 2011). However, to date there are no registered clinical trials specifically evaluating capsazepine for the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) or similar auditory pathologies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This indicates that although the drug has a strong preclinical foundation in modulating TRPV1 signaling in the cochlea, its clinical application to ARHL remains to be fully explored.

Mechanism of Action:
Capsazepine acts as a competitive antagonist at the TRPV1 receptor, a nonselective cation channel that is highly permeable to Ca²⁺. Under physiological conditions, TRPV1 is activated by various stimuli, including capsaicin, heat, and acidic pH, leading to a rapid influx of Ca²⁺ into cells. In cochlear hair cells, which depend on tightly regulated Ca²⁺ signaling for mechanotransduction and the proper adaptation of the mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) channels, excessive Ca²⁺ entry through TRPV1 can disrupt cytosolic homeostasis. This dysregulation is thought to activate calcium-dependent proteases like calpain, ultimately contributing to cytoskeletal damage and impaired hair cell function (Ramkumar et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2003). At a molecular level, once capsazepine binds to TRPV1, it prevents the receptor from undergoing the conformational changes necessary for channel opening, effectively blocking the pathological Ca²⁺ influx during stress conditions. This antagonistic action has been well characterized in sensory neurons as well as in isolated cochlear tissue preparations (Steyger, 2003; Zheng et al., 2003). Furthermore, there is evidence that by inhibiting TRPV1, capsazepine may help preserve local phosphoinositide levels in the cell membrane, which is important because alterations in membrane phosphoinositides can affect the function of other mechanosensitive channels such as Piezo channels, potentially influencing mechanotransduction processes (Borbiro et al., 2015). Additional studies have shown that at concentrations as low as 5 μM, capsazepine is effective in blocking TRPV1 currents in sensory cells, thereby limiting excessive Ca²⁺ entry (Yang et al., 2019). While its primary mechanism of antagonism is through direct receptor blockade, off-target effects have been reported such as modulation of HCN channels (Gill et al., 2004) and activation of specific sodium channels under acidic conditions (Yamamura et al., 2004), but these effects are usually context dependent and may require careful titration in in vivo systems.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for the potential use of capsazepine in ARHL is that by inhibiting pathological TRPV1-mediated Ca²⁺ influx in aging hair cells, the drug will prevent Ca²⁺ overload that can compromise the adaptation and proper gating of MET channels. In mature cochlear hair cells, MET channels are crucial for converting mechanical stimuli into receptor potentials, and their function is exquisitely sensitive to intracellular Ca²⁺ levels. Excessive Ca²⁺ influx, as might occur when TRPV1 is hyperactivated by age-associated stressors such as oxidative damage or inflammatory mediators, can lead to sustained high intracellular Ca²⁺ levels that impair the rapid adaptation kinetics of MET channels (Ramkumar et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2003). By blocking these channels, capsazepine is expected to preserve normal Ca²⁺ homeostasis in hair cells, maintain appropriate cytoskeletal dynamics, and prevent the activation of calpain-mediated proteolysis, which has been implicated in age-related degradation of hair cell structure (Mukherjea et al., 2011). This preservation of Ca²⁺ signaling would theoretically support sustained mechanotransduction and, subsequently, better auditory function over time. Additionally, there is supporting evidence that TRPV1 is expressed in the organ of Corti—including outer hair cells (OHCs), inner hair cells (IHCs), and supporting cells—indicating the plausibility that its antagonism could directly influence the adaptive responses of these sensory cells (Zheng et al., 2003; Steyger, 2003). In inner ear models where TRPV1 antagonists have been used, the preservation of cochlear potentials and modulation of blood flow indirectly suggest a protective effect against ototoxic insults (Steyger, 2003; Zheng et al., 2003). Therefore, in the ARHL context, capsazepine is expected to act by maintaining hair cell integrity through the prevention of Ca²⁺ overload, thereby ensuring that MET channel adaptation kinetics remain within a range that supports proper mechanotransduction.

Overall Evaluation:
Capsazepine holds promise as a therapeutic candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss based on its well-characterized ability to block TRPV1-mediated Ca²⁺ influx. One of the major strengths of this candidate is the extensive preclinical evidence supporting the role of TRPV1 in mediating pathological Ca²⁺ entry that can lead to hair cell dysfunction in various models of cochlear injury, including those induced by cisplatin and possibly noise exposure (Mukherjea et al., 2008; Mukherjea et al., 2011). Capsazepine’s capacity to normalize electrophysiological parameters in the cochlea by antagonizing TRPV1 has been demonstrated through experiments involving changes in cochlear microphonics and otoacoustic emissions (Steyger, 2003; Zheng et al., 2003). In the context of ARHL, where cumulative oxidative stress and inflammatory processes lead to dysregulation of Ca²⁺ homeostasis, the proposed mechanism by which capsazepine preserves MET channel kinetics is both biologically plausible and supported by mechanistic studies showing TRPV1’s involvement in sensory transduction (Ramkumar et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2003).

The strengths of capsazepine include its high specificity as a TRPV1 antagonist, its established preclinical use in inner ear research, and its ability to acutely modulate Ca²⁺ influx at concentrations (approximately 5 μM) that are relevant in these experimental settings (Yang et al., 2019; Steyger, 2003). Its synthetic origin and historical use in pain models lend additional credibility to its potential repurposing for ARHL. Moreover, the mechanistic insights provided by studies on TRPV1’s gating properties and its regulation of phosphoinositide-dependent signaling pathways suggest that blocking TRPV1 may also indirectly preserve the functionality of mechanosensitive channels like Piezo, which could be beneficial for maintaining hair cell mechanotransduction (Borbiro et al., 2015).

However, there are also notable weaknesses and challenges. First, capsazepine has not been clinically validated for auditory indications, and no clinical trials have directly examined its efficacy in ARHL (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The translational leap from acute ototoxicity paradigms (for example, cisplatin-induced injury) to the chronic, multifactorial degeneration observed in ARHL remains a significant hurdle. Additionally, while the compound is effective in blocking TRPV1, its off-target effects on channels such as HCN and ENaC—as observed in some studies—raise concerns about potential unintended actions that could affect cochlear or systemic functions (Gill et al., 2004; Yamamura et al., 2004). Such off-target effects might prove problematic in a chronic treatment regimen aimed at elderly populations, who are often more susceptible to side effects. There is also the fact that ARHL is a complex, multifactorial condition, and while dysregulation of Ca²⁺ signaling is one component, other factors such as cumulative oxidative damage, vascular changes, and genetic predispositions play significant roles. Therefore, capsazepine’s effects might only address a subset of the pathological processes underlying ARHL.

Overall, the preclinical data support the hypothesis that TRPV1 contributes significantly to cochlear Ca²⁺ dysregulation and that its inhibition by capsazepine can mitigate deleterious Ca²⁺ overload in hair cells (Ramkumar et al., 2022; Steyger, 2003). This provides a strong mechanistic rationale for further investigation. The next logical steps would include comprehensive in vivo studies in aging animal models to assess long-term safety, optimal dosing, and efficacy of capsazepine in preserving hearing function. It will also be important to evaluate whether capsazepine can effectively maintain MET channel adaptation over time without disrupting normal cochlear physiology and whether any off-target effects can be minimized through formulation or dosing strategies.

In summary, while capsazepine has promising attributes as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss, significant further preclinical and eventually clinical studies are warranted to establish its efficacy and safety profile in this new indication. Its strengths lie in its well-defined mechanism of TRPV1 antagonism and its demonstrated protective effects in inner ear models, whereas its weaknesses include the lack of direct clinical evidence for ARHL, potential off-target effects, and the complex pathophysiology of ARHL that extend beyond Ca²⁺ dysregulation. Based on the current literature, capsazepine represents a scientifically sound candidate warranting additional investigation in models of aging-induced auditory degeneration (Mukherjea et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2003; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

MCC950,"Proposal for MCC950

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
MCC950 is a fully synthetic, small‐molecule inhibitor that was discovered using high‐throughput screening methods followed by extensive medicinal chemistry optimization. Initially identified as a potent inhibitor of IL-1β processing, MCC950 belongs to the diarylsulfonylurea class of compounds whose chemical frameworks were originally developed in contexts such as anti-diabetic research and have been later repurposed for controlling inflammasome-driven inflammation. Its chemical structure is defined by a hexahydroindacene tricyclic ring system that is fused to a sulfonylurea pharmacophore, with additional heteroaromatic substituents added to optimize crucial pharmacokinetic properties such as oral bioavailability and central nervous system penetration. The synthesis of MCC950 involved derivatization of sulfonamide intermediates, ensuring that the final molecule attained both the necessary lipophilicity for membrane permeability and the polar interactions required for high-affinity binding to its molecular target (Agarwal et al., 2020; Coll et al., 2015). In recent studies, related sulfonylurea compounds have been further optimized to address issues such as hepatotoxicity and systemic off-target effects by modifying key structural motifs; these efforts underscore the importance of the diarylsulfonylurea scaffold as a promising chemical class for modulating inflammatory pathways through direct inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Bertinaria et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2019). Overall, MCC950 stands out among other NLRP3 inhibitors because it combines a well-defined molecular structure with excellent drug-like properties, positioning it as a leading candidate to be repurposed for chronic inflammatory conditions such as Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL).

Therapeutic History
Historically, MCC950 has been employed primarily as a research tool to elucidate the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in a variety of inflammatory, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disease models. Extensive preclinical studies in rodent models have shown that MCC950 potently inhibits inflammasome assembly in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other immune cell types at low nanomolar concentrations. It has demonstrated efficacy in mitigating disease phenotypes in models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), and even in paradigms mimicking neuroinflammatory conditions such as traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer’s disease (Coll et al., 2015; Coll et al., 2019). In one notable preclinical study, MCC950 was able to reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines and suppress downstream NF-κB signaling, thereby reducing tissue damage and improving clinical outcomes in animal models of stroke and other inflammatory conditions (Perera et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020). Despite robust preclinical efficacy, MCC950’s clinical development encountered challenges when dose-dependent liver enzyme elevations were observed during a phase II clinical trial in rheumatoid arthritis patients. This safety concern led to the discontinuation of further clinical development in that indication, although the compound continues to serve as a gold-standard research probe for exploring the biology of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Importantly, while MCC950 has been extensively characterized in inflammatory and neurodegenerative contexts, there is currently no direct evidence from the literature that it has been tested or validated in models of Age-Related Hearing Loss or cochlear inflammation. Yet, the mechanistic parallels between NLRP3-driven inflammation in other tissues and the emerging role of inflammasome activity in age-related cochlear degeneration suggest that repurposing MCC950 for ARHL holds significant promise (Bai et al., 2021; Bazard et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action
At its core, MCC950 operates through a highly selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that is a central regulator of the innate immune response. Biochemically, the compound exerts its action by directly binding to the NACHT domain of the NLRP3 protein. More specifically, MCC950 targets the Walker B motif within this domain, thereby directly blocking ATP hydrolysis. This step is critical because ATP hydrolysis is required for the conformational changes that yield NLRP3 oligomerization and subsequent assembly of the inflammasome complex. Inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by MCC950 effectively stabilizes NLRP3 in its inactive, closed conformation, precluding the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and the subsequent activation of caspase-1 (Coll et al., 2019). As a result, the proteolytic processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18 is halted. These cytokines are normally generated through caspase-1 mediated cleavage and are responsible for propagating robust inflammatory signaling cascades, including the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Of particular importance is that MCC950 demonstrates specificity by not affecting upstream priming signals such as Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated NF-κB activation or interfering with other inflammasome complexes like AIM2 or NLRC4. This ensures that the compound specifically negates NLRP3-dependent inflammation without causing broad immunosuppression (Haque et al., 2024; Perera et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020). Additionally, structural studies and binding assays have confirmed that MCC950 interacts with the NLRP3 protein in a manner that disrupts its association with NEK7—a kinase that is indispensable for inflammasome activation—further contributing to its potent anti-inflammatory profile. This dual mechanism of inhibiting both ATP hydrolysis and interfering with NEK7 binding underscores the compound’s effectiveness in blocking NLRP3 assembly and subsequent inflammatory signaling (Coll et al., 2015).

Expected Effect in Age-Related Hearing Loss
The hypothesis underlying the evaluation of MCC950 for Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) centers on the concept that chronic low-grade inflammation—referred to as “inflammaging”—is a major driver of cochlear degeneration. In the aging cochlea, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in the pathological release of IL-1β and IL-18, pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Elevated ROS levels, in turn, are believed to impair the function of hair cell mechanotransduction (MET) channels, which are essential for maintaining endocochlear potential and proper auditory transduction (Bazard et al., 2021; Unknown Reference, 2017). In experimental animal models, chronic activation of inflammatory pathways, as evidenced by increased levels of IL-1β, has been correlated with degraded MET channel performance and eventual hearing loss. By selectively inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome, MCC950 is expected to significantly reduce the maturation and release of IL-1β and IL-18. This effect would lead to a lower intracellular and extracellular concentration of these cytokines, thereby attenuating the downstream activation of NF-κB signaling and subsequent ROS production. In essence, the expected outcome in the cochlea would be a preservation of the normal function and gating properties of MET channels, maintenance of the endocochlear potential, and ultimately, a stabilization of hair cell function (Bai et al., 2021; Xing et al., 2021).

A key aspect of this therapeutic hypothesis is that NLRP3 expression has been observed in cochlear tissues during aging. Elevated markers of inflammasome activation—including ASC oligomerization, caspase-1 activation, and increased interleukin-1β levels—have been documented in aged mouse cochleae, suggesting that NLRP3-mediated inflammatory processes contribute to the decline in hair cell function (Unknown Reference, 2017). Consequently, by applying MCC950 in preclinical models of ARHL, one would expect to observe a marked reduction in these inflammatory markers along with a stabilization—or even an improvement—in auditory function. Furthermore, given its favorable pharmacokinetic properties, which include high oral bioavailability and documented blood-brain barrier penetration in rodent studies at dosing regimens typically in the range of 10–20 mg/kg, MCC950 is well-positioned for systemic administration that could reach cochlear tissues either directly or indirectly via extracellular vesicle transport pathways (Agarwal et al., 2020; Bai et al., 2021). The reduction in cytokine signaling by MCC950 would be expected to yield downstream benefits such as reduced oxidative stress, lower levels of apoptotic signaling, and preservation of cell membrane integrity of hair cells, all of which are crucial for maintaining proper mechanotransduction (Coll et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2023). In addition, by specifically targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome, MCC950 avoids the broader immunosuppressive effects that are commonly associated with corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory agents, potentially allowing for long-term administration in a chronic condition like ARHL without compromising the overall immune function of the patient (Bai et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation
Overall, MCC950 is a scientifically well-supported candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss; its mechanism of selectively inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome corresponds closely with the underlying inflammatory pathways that drive cochlear degeneration during aging. One of the major strengths of MCC950 lies in its high degree of molecular selectivity—by binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ATP hydrolysis, it directly disrupts the assembly of the inflammasome and halts the cascade of cytokine release that ultimately leads to tissue degradation. This precision minimizes off-target effects and reduces the risk of broad immunosuppression, which is a critical consideration in chronic therapeutic regimens (Coll et al., 2019; Perera et al., 2018). Moreover, the robust preclinical data supporting MCC950’s efficacy across various models of inflammatory pathology—ranging from neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases to traumatic injuries—provides a compelling rationale for its evaluation in the context of ARHL, where similar inflammatory processes have been documented (Coll et al., 2015; Bai et al., 2021).

Yet, there are also challenges and weaknesses that must be addressed. First, despite the promising mechanistic rationale, direct preclinical evidence demonstrating MCC950’s efficacy in cochlear tissue or in models of ARHL is currently lacking. There are no published studies that specifically examine its effect on hair cell mechanotransduction or auditory function in vivo or in vitro; thus, the therapeutic hypothesis remains to be rigorously validated in dedicated hearing-loss models (Unknown Reference, 2017; Bazard et al., 2021). Second, previous clinical experiences with MCC950 have raised safety concerns, most notably hepatotoxicity observed in rheumatoid arthritis trials. This calls for careful dose optimization and long-term safety evaluations, especially in the context of a chronic, progressive condition such as ARHL, where prolonged dosing may be necessary (Agarwal et al., 2020; Perera et al., 2018). Third, the unique anatomical barriers associated with the inner ear pose additional challenges for effective drug delivery; although MCC950 has demonstrated favorable central nervous system penetration, its distribution specifically to cochlear tissues must be confirmed through targeted pharmacokinetic studies (Kaur et al., 2025; Keuler et al., 2022).

Additionally, while the compound’s mechanism of action is well-defined at the molecular level, the complexity of the inflammatory network in the aging cochlea may require a combinatorial therapeutic approach. Chronic inflammation in ARHL involves multiple cytokines, oxidative stress pathways, and changes in mitochondrial function, suggesting that inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome alone may not fully restore cochlear function. Future studies may need to assess the potential synergistic effects of MCC950 when combined with antioxidants or agents that support mitochondrial health and autophagy. Nonetheless, the targeted nature of MCC950 makes it an attractive candidate, as it can specifically modulate the deleterious aspects of the innate immune response while sparing general immune functions, a balance that is difficult to achieve with broader-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs (Bai et al., 2021; Xing et al., 2021).

To summarize, MCC950 is a highly promising therapeutic candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss based on its ability to selectively inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby reducing IL-1β and IL-18 maturation and limiting the ROS production that contributes to hair cell dysfunction. Its synthetic origins, detailed structure-activity relationships, and favorable pharmacokinetic profile—including oral bioavailability and brain penetration—support its potential application in disorders driven by chronic inflammation. However, before MCC950 can be advanced to clinical trials for ARHL, several critical gaps must be addressed: preclinical studies in relevant cochlear models must be conducted to confirm its efficacy in preserving mechanotransduction channel function; its safety profile must be re-evaluated in the context of chronic administration; and effective strategies for targeting drug delivery to the inner ear must be developed. Overall, the candidate’s strengths lie in its molecular specificity, robust mechanistic rationale, and extensive validation in other inflammatory disease models, while its weaknesses include the current lack of direct evidence in ARHL and potential safety concerns that could arise during long-term treatment (Coll et al., 2015; Coll et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2025; Krishnan et al., 2019).

In conclusion, while MCC950 has not yet been directly employed for Age-Related Hearing Loss, its well-characterized inhibitory effect on NLRP3 inflammasome activation offers a scientifically compelling strategy to combat cochlear inflammaging and preserve hair cell function. The repurposing of MCC950 for ARHL is based on a strong mechanistic foundation drawn from studies in multiple inflammatory models, and its potential to reduce IL-1β-mediated oxidative stress could translate into significant clinical benefits for hearing preservation. Moving forward, further research focusing on cochlear pharmacodynamics, targeted delivery to the inner ear, and long-term safety assessments remains essential to fully validate MCC950 as a therapeutic candidate for ARHL (Agarwal et al., 2020; Bai et al., 2021; Bazard et al., 2021; Perera et al., 2018; Krishnan et al., 2019).

Olaparib,"Proposal for Olaparib

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Olaparib (Lynparza®) is a synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor of poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) discovered during the development of targeted oncology therapies. It belongs to the class of PARP inhibitors, which are designed to bind competitively at the NAD⁺ catalytic site of PARP1 and PARP2. Olaparib was originally synthesized to exploit the concept of synthetic lethality in BRCA-mutated cancers by preventing PARylation, thereby impeding single-strand DNA break repair and leading to the accumulation of double-strand breaks in cells deficient in homologous recombination repair. Its chemical structure was developed based on structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies, and it has been extensively characterized in preclinical studies before being approved for clinical oncology applications (Bochum et al., 2018). In the broader context, PARP inhibitors have been used predominantly in oncology; however, their mechanism of action—namely, interfering with the cellular response to DNA damage by preventing NAD⁺ consumption through PARylation—opens up the possibility for repurposing in diseases where excessive PARP1 activation leads to NAD⁺ depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction. In our proposed strategy, Olaparib is hypothesized to prevent age-related NAD⁺ depletion in cochlear hair cells, thereby preserving the activity of NAD⁺-dependent sirtuins that are essential for mitochondrial maintenance and resistance to oxidative stress (Ege et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Olaparib has garnered extensive clinical experience as a therapeutic agent in oncology. It has been approved for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer and has demonstrated efficacy in other BRCA-mutated malignancies. Phase I trials, such as the one reported in the final report of a phase I study combining Olaparib with cetuximab and radiation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, have highlighted its safety profile and pharmacokinetic properties in a patient population with advanced disease (Karam et al., 2018). Despite its widespread use in oncology, there are no clinical studies or veterinary reports to date that have evaluated its efficacy for hearing loss, including age-related hearing loss or cochlear dysfunction. Indeed, a search of ClinicalTrials.gov under “Olaparib AND (hearing loss OR cochlear OR age-related hearing loss OR presbycusis)” revealed no current investigations directly targeting these auditory conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nonetheless, preclinical evidence and the emerging conceptual framework regarding the role of PARP1 activation in cellular aging suggest that its mechanism might be translated to conditions beyond cancer, including the degenerative processes observed in the aging cochlea (Ege et al., 2024; Okur et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Olaparib functions by binding to the catalytic domain of PARP1. PARP1 is normally activated in response to DNA damage—especially single-strand breaks—and catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose units from NAD⁺ onto various acceptor proteins via a process called poly-ADP ribosylation (PARylation). By competitively binding to the NAD⁺ binding site, Olaparib inhibits PARP1’s enzymatic activity, thereby preventing the assembly of PAR chains on target proteins. This mechanism effectively blocks the recruitment of DNA repair proteins to sites of damage. In the context of aging cochlear cells, excessive activation of PARP1 (as can be triggered by cumulative oxidative DNA damage) may lead to significant depletion of intracellular NAD⁺ pools. NAD⁺ is an essential cofactor for various metabolic processes, most notably for the activity of sirtuins such as SIRT1 and SIRT3, which are NAD⁺-dependent deacetylases critically involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) management, and autophagy regulation (Ege et al., 2024; Song et al., 2016). Inhibition of PARP1 by Olaparib is proposed to prevent this NAD⁺ depletion, thereby facilitating the maintenance of sirtuin activity. This, in turn, supports mitochondrial respiratory function and ATP production—which are vital for mechanotransduction in cochlear hair cells—and reduces the onset of PARP1-mediated cell death pathways, such as parthanatos. Additionally, this inhibition may lower oxidative stress and improve mitochondrial dynamics through indirect preservation of the NAD⁺ pool (Bochum et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed application for age-related hearing loss, it is anticipated that Olaparib will exert multiple beneficial effects on cochlear physiology. First, by inhibiting PARP1, Olaparib will reduce the rate of NAD⁺ consumption in response to age- and ROS-induced DNA damage in cochlear hair cells, thereby preserving intracellular NAD⁺ levels. This preservation is expected to maintain the activity of key sirtuins (notably SIRT1 and SIRT3), both of which have been demonstrated to play protective roles in auditory tissues by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, reducing oxidative damage, and promoting autophagic clearance of damaged organelles (Ege et al., 2024; Pang et al., 2019). Maintenance of ATP production via improved mitochondrial respiration is vital for supporting the energetically demanding mechanotransduction process in hair cells, particularly in high-frequency regions of the cochlea where energy demands are high. Moreover, by preventing the formation of excessive PAR polymers, as observed in preclinical studies where Olaparib reduced PAR polymer formation at doses around 50 mg/kg/day in rodents, the drug could potentially mitigate cell death triggered by the cascade of events following PARP1 overactivation (Ege et al., 2024). This improved cellular environment is hypothesized to ultimately preserve the structural and functional integrity of cochlear hair cells, thereby slowing or preventing the progression of age-related hearing loss. Importantly, sirtuin activity (and specifically the expression of SIRT1 and SIRT3) has been documented in auditory tissues, highlighting the relevance of the NAD⁺-sirtuin axis in cochlear health (Ege et al., 2024; Han et al., 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
Our comprehensive review suggests that Olaparib is a promising candidate for repurposing in the context of age-related hearing loss. One of its major strengths lies in its robust and well-characterized mechanism of action in inhibiting PARP1, which is central to the prevention of NAD⁺ depletion in cells exposed to cumulative oxidative stress—a common feature in aging tissues, including the cochlea (Ege et al., 2024; Song et al., 2016). The established safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of Olaparib from its extensive use in oncology also add to its appeal for repurposing, as this reduces the uncertainty regarding toxicity and systemic effects when considering translational applications (Bochum et al., 2018; Karam et al., 2018).

However, several weaknesses and challenges must be noted. To date, there is no preclinical or clinical data directly assessing the efficacy of Olaparib in preserving cochlear structure or function in hearing loss models. The extrapolation from oncology to auditory protection is mechanistically appealing but remains speculative until validated in dedicated animal models of cochlear aging. In particular, the expression and activity profiles of PARP1 and related NAD⁺-dependent enzymes in cochlear hair cells have been characterized in the context of aging (Ege et al., 2024), but direct studies measuring the impact of PARP1 inhibition in these tissues are lacking. Moreover, dosing regimens effective in cancer treatment might not translate directly to the nuanced requirements of long-term therapy for age-related hearing loss, where chronic, low-dose intervention may be necessary to prevent gradual cellular decline (Okur et al., 2023).

It is also important to consider that while Olaparib’s effects on NAD⁺ conservation and sirtuin activation have been demonstrated in models showing improved mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress (Brown et al., 2014; Ege et al., 2024), the auditory cell environment may exhibit unique pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties that influence drug distribution, retention, and efficacy. Approaches such as localized delivery to the cochlea or formulation modifications may be necessary to achieve optimal therapeutic concentrations without systemic side effects.

In terms of expected cellular outcomes, preserving NAD⁺ levels and supporting sirtuin-mediated mitochondrial repair are both promising mechanisms for forestalling the degenerative cascade in cochlear hair cells. The maintenance of mitochondrial health is essential not only for energy production but also for managing reactive oxygen species and ensuring effective cellular repair mechanisms. The proposed effect of Olaparib in maintaining mechanotransduction capacity via sustained ATP production and improved mitochondrial respiration is highly relevant given that auditory transduction is an energy-intensive process (Ege et al., 2024; Pang et al., 2019). Therefore, preventing cell death through inhibition of PARP1-mediated pathways such as parthanatos could maintain functional hair cell populations and, by extension, preserve hearing.

Overall, the strengths of Olaparib for the treatment of age-related hearing loss lie in its clearly defined molecular target (PARP1), the established link between PARP1 activity and NAD⁺ depletion in aging cells, and supportive evidence from related studies demonstrating that preservation of NAD⁺ levels can enhance sirtuin function and mitochondrial integrity (Ege et al., 2024; Pang et al., 2019). Conversely, the weaknesses are centered on the lack of direct preclinical auditory data, uncertainties related to chronic dosing in non-cancer populations, and the potential challenge of achieving effective drug delivery in cochlear tissues.

In conclusion, while Olaparib is a well-established PARP1 inhibitor with documented efficacy in oncology, its mechanism of preserving NAD⁺ pools and supporting sirtuin activity provides a compelling rationale for investigation in age-related hearing loss. The current literature supports the notion that excessive PARP1 activation contributes to cochlear cell aging via NAD⁺ depletion, and thus targeting this pathway could ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction, reduce oxidative stress, and preserve the mechanotransductive machinery of hair cells (Ege et al., 2024; Han et al., 2016; Okur et al., 2023). However, critical gaps in direct auditory research remain, necessitating comprehensive preclinical validation in relevant animal models. Future studies should focus on determining the optimal dose for cochlear protection, evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy profiles in auditory tissues, and assessing whether localized drug delivery methods can maximize cochlear uptake while minimizing systemic exposure. Given these considerations, Olaparib represents a promising candidate that warrants further investigation as a repurposed therapeutic agent to prevent or slow the progression of age-related hearing loss (Ege et al., 2024; Okur et al., 2023).

NS1619,"Proposal for NS1619

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
NS1619 is a synthetic benzimidazolone compound originally identified and characterized as a potent opener of large‐conductance calcium‐activated potassium (BK) channels (also called BKCa channels or KCa1.1), which are encoded by the KCNMA1 gene. Its chemical synthesis was performed via rational drug design approaches that aimed to produce molecules capable of increasing the open probability of BK channels, thereby hyperpolarizing cells and influencing cellular excitability. As a member of the synthetic BK channel opener class, NS1619 belongs to a group of compounds that have been widely employed in biomedical research to probe the function of BK channels not only in neuronal and vascular contexts but also in models of ischemia/reperfusion injury and other forms of cell stress. Its development and subsequent application in neuroprotection studies underscore its utility as a pharmacological tool to modulate ion channel function, and its structural and functional characteristics have served as a prototype for further chemical exploration in the field (Katakam, 2008, pp. 1–2; Shieh et al., 2003, pp. 8–9).

Therapeutic History:
NS1619 has been extensively used in preclinical investigations, particularly in the context of neuronal preconditioning and protection against ischemic injury. In several studies, NS1619 was shown to activate BK channels in various cell types, thereby modulating action potential firing and influencing intracellular calcium handling through membrane hyperpolarization. Early research in neuronal models demonstrated that administration of NS1619 could induce immediate or delayed neuroprotective effects by affecting mitochondrial function and attenuating excitotoxicity; these effects are believed to be mediated by its ability to trigger mild mitochondrial depolarization and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, ultimately engaging pro-survival signaling cascades (Gáspár et al., 2009, pp. 4–6; Katakam, 2008, pp. 1–2). Furthermore, in a recent study involving cochlear hair cells, peroxisome deficiency was found to reduce BK channel expression, a pathology that correlated with hearing loss in genetically modified mice; notably, pharmacological activation of BK channels using NS1619 (along with NS11021) restored auditory function in these models, thereby providing proof-of-concept evidence that BK channel activation may ameliorate sensorineural hearing deficits (Fu et al., 2023, pp. 9–11). However, systematic clinical data supporting NS1619’s use for Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) or presbycusis remain sparse, and most of the therapeutic experience with this compound is derived from acute neuronal or cardiac preconditioning studies rather than long-term interventions in auditory systems.

Mechanism of Action:
NS1619’s primary mechanism involves the pharmacological activation of BK channels. Under physiological conditions, BK channels couple membrane depolarization and intracellular calcium increases to produce a significant potassium efflux, which is critical for rapid repolarization and stabilization of the membrane potential. NS1619 increases the open probability of BK channels, thereby promoting K⁺ efflux and leading to cellular hyperpolarization. This hyperpolarization is expected to counteract prolonged depolarization events, thereby reducing the influx of Ca²⁺ through voltage-dependent calcium channels and mechanotransduction (MET) channels. At the molecular level, NS1619 binds to BK channels and facilitates a conformational change that favors channel opening without significantly altering single-channel conductance; rather, it augments both the mean open time and the frequency of channel activation (Shieh et al., 2003, pp. 8–9). In neuronal models, the protective effects of NS1619 have been partially attributed to its off-target effects such as mild mitochondrial depolarization and ROS generation, which may activate intracellular cascades involving the PI3K/Akt pathway and subsequently inhibit apoptosis via reduced caspase activation (Katakam, 2008, pp. 10–11). It is important to note, however, that while NS1619 is classically described as a BK channel opener, its precise molecular interactions in different tissues can vary, and some studies suggest that its effects on mitochondrial respiration and cellular energy balance may arise independently of direct BK channel activation.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for employing NS1619 in the treatment of ARHL is that by specifically increasing BK channel activity in cochlear hair cells, NS1619 will facilitate rapid repolarization of these cells following mechano‐electrical transduction events. In aged hair cells, impaired function of the plasma membrane Ca²⁺ ATPase (PMCA2) and prolonged opening of MET channels contribute to pathological intracellular Ca²⁺ accumulation, leading to cytotoxicity, excitotoxic damage, and defective adaptation kinetics in the sensory apparatus. By activating BK channels, NS1619 is anticipated to produce hyperpolarization that limits further Ca²⁺ influx during prolonged depolarizations, thereby restoring the rapid closure of MET channels and preserving the cell’s ability to adapt to continuous mechanical stimulation. This is particularly relevant in the aged cochlea where excitation–relaxation cycles are compromised, and maintaining appropriate ion channel function is critical for auditory signal fidelity. BK channels have been shown to contribute significantly to hair cell repolarization and efficient neurotransmitter release, and their reduced expression or dysfunction – as demonstrated in genetic or chemically-induced models – correlates with hearing deficits. Therefore, by restoring BK channel function with NS1619, one expects an improvement in auditory brainstem response outcomes and potentially a reduction in progressive hearing loss symptoms associated with age-dependent decline in ion channel function (Fu et al., 2023, pp. 9–11; Pinheiro et al., 2021, pp. 5–6).

Overall Evaluation:
NS1619 presents a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss based on its well-documented ability to activate BK channels, thereby facilitating cellular repolarization and mitigating Ca²⁺ overload – a key pathological mechanism implicated in hair cell degeneration in aging. One major strength of NS1619 is its established use as a research tool in various models of neuroprotection, which provides a substantial mechanistic rationale for its application to auditory system preservation. Evidence from peroxisome deficiency models in cochlear hair cells suggests that BK channel enhancement can restore auditory function, lending support to the underlying hypothesis that similar mechanisms of cellular protection may apply in ARHL (Fu et al., 2023, pp. 9–11). Additionally, the synthetic origin and precise molecular mechanism of NS1619 confer a well-defined structure–function relationship that can be further optimized for selectivity and potency in auditory tissues.

Nevertheless, there are notable weaknesses that must be addressed. NS1619 has been reported to exhibit off-target effects, including alterations in mitochondrial function and inhibition of L-type Ca²⁺ channels at higher concentrations, which may limit its therapeutic index (Van et al., 2024, pp. 27–28; Gáspár et al., 2009, pp. 4–6). These nonselective actions may lead to unintended consequences in long-term administration, especially in a clinical setting where chronic treatment is required for ARHL. Moreover, while there is promising preclinical evidence in certain models of hearing loss, there is a lack of direct clinical trial data or extensive in vivo studies specifically addressing NS1619’s efficacy in age-related auditory decline. The compound’s pharmacokinetic profile, tissue-specific permeability (including inner ear barriers), and potential systemic effects require thorough investigation before advancing into later stages of drug development. Another consideration is that age-related hearing loss is multifactorial in nature; while targeting BK channels may alleviate some aspects of the pathophysiology, other contributing factors such as synaptopathy, oxidative damage, and changes in cochlear homeostasis may not be fully addressed by BK channel modulation alone (Bazard et al., 2021, pp. 13–15; Pinheiro et al., 2021, pp. 8–9).

In summary, NS1619 is a well-characterized synthetic BK channel opener with a substantial body of preclinical evidence supporting its role in modulating cellular excitability and providing neuroprotection through enhanced potassium efflux and membrane repolarization. Its ability to potentially restore the rapid adaptation kinetics of MET channels in aged cochlear hair cells by reducing intracellular Ca²⁺ overload is consistent with the mechanistic needs dictated by ARHL pathology. However, challenges such as off-target effects, limited direct evidence in ARHL models, and the need for robust pharmacokinetic and safety profiles present significant hurdles. Given these factors, NS1619 merits further investigation in well-controlled preclinical studies specifically designed to assess its impact on cochlear hair cell function and long-term auditory outcomes in age-related hearing loss (Katakam, 2008, pp. 11–12; Van et al., 2024, pp. 10–11; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Dasatinib,"Proposal for Dasatinib

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dasatinib, marketed under the name Sprycel®, is a second‐generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) originally developed for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome‐positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Derived synthetically by medicinal chemistry methods and formulated based on structure–activity relationships observed in earlier TKIs, dasatinib was designed to inhibit BCR‐ABL and several other tyrosine kinases including members of the Src family, c-kit, EPHA2, and PDGF receptors (Rivera-Torres & San José, 2019). Dasatinib belongs to a class of small-molecule compounds that exert their effects by binding to the ATP-binding pockets of target kinases, thereby blocking phosphorylation events that are critical for the signaling pathways driving cellular proliferation and survival. In recent years, beyond its established use as an anticancer agent, dasatinib has been repurposed due to its senolytic properties—that is, its ability to selectively induce apoptosis in senescent cells by targeting the anti-apoptotic pathways (Hickson et al., 2019; Islam et al., 2023). The rationale for its repurposing in age-related diseases such as Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) is based on the emerging understanding that senescent cells accumulate in various organs with aging and contribute to tissue degeneration via their senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Dasatinib’s chemical structure and kinase inhibition profile position it as a promising candidate to remove these deleterious cell populations and restore tissue homeostasis (Kirkland & Tchkonia, 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Dasatinib has a well-established history in the oncology field and has been evaluated and used in clinical practice for the treatment of CML and ALL due to its potent inhibition of BCR-ABL and multiple other kinases that drive malignant cellular proliferation. Clinical trials and post-marketing studies have documented its efficacy in reducing leukemic cell burden, while also outlining its side effect profile which includes myelosuppression, pleural effusions, and occasionally pulmonary arterial hypertension (Rivera-Torres & San José, 2019). Over the past several years, attention has turned to the possibility of repurposing dasatinib for non-oncologic conditions, particularly those associated with aging. Preclinical studies in rodent models have demonstrated that dasatinib, particularly when combined with natural polyphenols like quercetin, can effectively clear senescent cells from multiple tissues (Ege et al., 2024; Meiners et al., 2024). For instance, in aged mice, administration of dasatinib at doses as low as 5 mg/kg has been observed to decrease the expression of senescence markers in several tissues including adipose tissue and muscle, suggesting a role in prolonging healthspan (Ege et al., 2024). Although its use specifically for Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) has not yet reached the level of clinical trials—as confirmed by our Clinical Trial Search: Dasatinib AND (hearing loss OR cochlea OR age-related hearing loss OR presbycusis)—the mechanistic rationale and preclinical evidence in other age-related conditions provide a strong basis for exploring its application in the auditory field (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ege et al., 2024). Additionally, related research in cellular senescence and therapeutic interventions targeting the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) further supports investigating dasatinib’s ability to mitigate chronic inflammation in age-associated diseases (Bermúdez & Varela-Nieto, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
Dasatinib exerts its biological activity through a multi-targeted inhibition of tyrosine kinases, which include BCR-ABL, Src family kinases, c-kit, and PDGF receptors. The compound binds competitively to the ATP-binding site of these kinases, thereby blocking downstream phosphorylation events critical for survival and proliferation signals in both cancer and, importantly for our interest, senescent cells (Rivera-Torres & San José, 2019). Senescent cells are characterized by their resistance to apoptosis, largely due to the upregulation of anti-apoptotic pathways, often referred to as senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways (SCAPs). Dasatinib disrupts these pathways by inhibiting kinases that drive prosurvival signals. For example, dasatinib interferes with Src-mediated signaling, which not only is essential for oncogenic survival but also plays a role in maintaining the viability of senescent cells that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines (Hickson et al., 2019; Konstantinou et al., 2024). Moreover, the combination of dasatinib with quercetin has been shown to produce a synergistic senolytic effect, where quercetin acts to target additional survival signals—by inhibiting kinases such as PI3K/AKT and downregulating members of the BCL-2 family—thereby facilitating the apoptotic clearance of senescent cells (Rattanaprukskul et al., 2025; Hickson et al., 2019). In aged tissues, senescent cells secrete a complex array of inflammatory proteins, growth factors, and proteases (collectively known as SASP), which contribute to local tissue degeneration, chronic inflammation, and impaired cellular function (Ege et al., 2024; Bermúdez & Varela-Nieto, 2021). By selectively inducing apoptosis in these cells, dasatinib can reduce the burden of SASP factors, thereby lowering levels of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that are known to disrupt the normal function of mechanotransduction channels in cochlear hair cells (Ege et al., 2024; Hayashi et al., 2023). The intricate interplay between senescence, inflammation, and degeneration in several tissues supports the biochemical hypothesis that dasatinib’s inhibition of kinase signaling can lead to downstream improvements in tissue homeostasis via reduced oxidative stress and restoration of regenerative capacities (Ege et al., 2024; Hickson et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
According to our hypothesis, dasatinib is expected to exert a protective effect on the aging cochlea by selectively eliminating senescent cells within both the hair cell populations and the supporting cellular elements. The accumulation of senescent cells in the cochlea has been implicated in the elevation of local SASP factors, which include pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6), matrix-degrading enzymes (MMPs), and other factors that can directly compromise the mechanotransduction (MET) channels in hair cells (Ege et al., 2024). By clearing these cells, dasatinib should reduce the chronic inflammatory milieu, restore redox homeostasis, and lower the oxidative burden—a scenario supported by preclinical studies in other tissues where senolytic treatment resulted in improved tissue function and decreased inflammation (Ege et al., 2024; Hickson et al., 2019). Specifically, the expected outcome in our assay is that dasatinib, possibly administered alone at an optimized dose (prior studies in mice have used around 5 mg/kg), will lead to a decrease in markers of senescence such as p16^INK4a and p21^CIP1, as well as a concomitant reduction in SASP factor levels. This reduction, in turn, should create a pro-homeostatic microenvironment in the cochlea where surviving hair cells maintain robust mechanotransduction capabilities, reflected in improved auditory function and preservation of hair cell integrity (Ege et al., 2024). Furthermore, known expression profiles indicate that elements of the anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory pathways targeted by dasatinib are indeed active in cochlear cells, including those essential for hair cell function and survival (Ege et al., 2024; Hayashi et al., 2023). By lowering the levels of SASP-related cytokines, dasatinib is anticipated to also reduce secondary inflammatory cascades and oxidative stress, further mitigating damage to the mechanosensory structures of the inner ear (Ege et al., 2024; Hickson et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, dasatinib is a compelling candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss due to its well-characterized senolytic activity and ability to modulate pro-survival and inflammatory pathways. One major strength of dasatinib lies in its broad-spectrum inhibition of tyrosine kinases—particularly those involved in maintaining the survival of senescent cells. Preclinical data in various tissues have demonstrated that intermittent dosing regimens of dasatinib (often in combination with quercetin) can effectively reduce senescent cell burdens and lower SASP factor levels, leading to overall improvements in tissue function and reduced chronic inflammation (Hickson et al., 2019; Ege et al., 2024). Given the role of senescence and SASP in damaging the hair cells and supporting structures in the cochlea, these findings lend robust mechanistic credibility to the hypothesis that dasatinib could help preserve mechanotransduction by lowering local inflammatory insults (Ege et al., 2024). Additionally, previous dosing studies in rodent models have shown that even at relatively low doses, dasatinib can induce significant clearance of senescent cells without undue toxicity, which is promising for translational applications in ARHL (Ege et al., 2024; Godoy et al., 2024).

However, there are also potential weaknesses and risks to consider. Dasatinib’s primary indication in oncology means that its safety profile has been established in cancer patients rather than in a population with a degenerative, non-malignant condition like ARHL. Its adverse effects—such as myelosuppression, pleural effusions, and potential cardiovascular complications—necessitate careful consideration when repurposing it for a chronic, age-related application (Rivera-Torres & San José, 2019). Furthermore, while the senolytic clearance of cells has been shown to provide systemic benefits, there is currently no direct clinical trial evidence demonstrating that dasatinib can reverse or halt cochlear degeneration. The absence of any registered clinical trials specifically addressing hearing loss with dasatinib signals that significant preclinical work in auditory models is required before clinical translation can be considered (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ege et al., 2024). Moreover, while combining dasatinib with quercetin has often produced synergistic effects in preclinical models, it remains to be fully established whether dasatinib alone can achieve the desired cochlear effects or whether a combinatorial approach will be necessary (Ege et al., 2024; Rattanaprukskul et al., 2025).

Biochemically, the mechanism by which dasatinib is expected to work in the cochlea is well supported by evidence from other tissues—its capacity to disable kinase pathways involved in the anti-apoptotic protection of senescent cells, reduce SASP-related inflammatory cytokines, and thus lower chronic inflammation and oxidative stress (Konstantinou et al., 2024; Hickson et al., 2019). These biochemical effects are anticipated to create an environment conducive to hair cell survival, potentially preserving mechanotransduction functionality by mitigating inflammation-induced MET channel dysfunction (Ege et al., 2024). In addition, the broader literature on cellular senescence supports the idea that removal of senescent cells can restore tissue homeostasis, improve regenerative capacities, and reduce the cascading effects of inflammatory mediators, all of which are critical for maintaining cochlear integrity in aging (Ege et al., 2024; Hayashi et al., 2023).

Overall, dasatinib represents a strong candidate for further investigation in the context of ARHL based on its established senolytic properties, its proven ability to reduce systemic and tissue-specific inflammatory markers, and the mechanistic rationale that links chronic inflammation and cellular senescence to cochlear hair cell degeneration (Ege et al., 2024; Meiners et al., 2024). The strengths include its well-known pharmacological profile in oncology, significant preclinical efficacy in reducing senescent cell burden (as demonstrated by reductions in p16^INK4a and p21^CIP1), and evidence from several studies indicating that the clearance of senescent cells can ameliorate age-related tissue dysfunction (Hickson et al., 2019; Ege et al., 2024). Key challenges remain in adapting an anti-cancer agent for chronic use in an elderly population with ARHL, ensuring safety at potentially lower doses over extended periods, and establishing direct preclinical efficacy in auditory models. Further studies—both in vitro using cochlear cell cultures and in vivo using animal models that closely mimic the human aging cochlea—are imperative to validate whether dasatinib can indeed lower SASP-driven inflammation and protect surviving hair cells to maintain mechanotransduction (Ege et al., 2024; Godoy et al., 2024; Hickson et al., 2019).

In conclusion, the preclinical mechanistic evidence supports dasatinib’s potential role in targeting senescent cells for Age-Related Hearing Loss by reducing the secretion of inflammatory SASP factors and thereby protecting hair cell function. Its established clinical use in oncology provides a detailed understanding of its pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, although this same profile poses challenges for chronic use in non-malignant conditions. The absence of direct clinical studies in ARHL highlights the need for further targeted animal and cell-based studies to rigorously evaluate its efficacy and safety in the auditory system. Given the available evidence from various sources (Ege et al., 2024; Hickson et al., 2019; Konstantinou et al., 2024), dasatinib’s repurposing warrants further investigation with a strategic research plan encompassing detailed preclinical auditory models, potential combinatorial use with senomorphic compounds such as quercetin, and careful dose optimization to maximize benefit while minimizing systemic adverse effects. Overall, dasatinib is a promising therapeutic candidate for Age-Related Hearing Loss that, if its senolytic and anti-inflammatory properties can be successfully harnessed in the cochlea, may help preserve hair cell mechanotransduction and slow the progression of ARHL.

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of sildenafil as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for age‐related hearing loss.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sildenafil, widely known under its trade name Viagra®, is a synthetic small‐molecule drug that belongs to the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor class. Initially discovered and developed as an agent to treat erectile dysfunction, sildenafil was designed following early observations with the compound zaprinast, with subsequent chemical refinements yielding improved potency and selectivity toward the PDE5 isoenzyme. This class of compounds functions by competitively inhibiting PDE5, an enzyme normally responsible for hydrolyzing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) into 5′-GMP; inhibition of this enzyme results in sustained elevations in intracellular cGMP levels. Elevated cGMP, in turn, potently activates downstream targets such as cGMP‐dependent protein kinase (PKG), which mediates smooth muscle relaxation through the regulation of intracellular calcium and other effectors. Originally, the clinical success of PDE5 inhibitors in promoting vasodilation—by enhancing nitric oxide (NO)/soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC)/cGMP signaling—led to their approval for erectile dysfunction and later for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The underlying mechanisms of these drugs have been well documented in vascular smooth muscle tissues, and there is now emerging theoretical interest in applying these vasodilatory properties in the inner ear. In particular, the stria vascularis, a highly vascularized structure essential for maintaining the ionic composition of the endolymph and the endocochlear potential, expresses PDE5 and other components of the NO/cGMP pathway. This anatomical and molecular presence suggests that modulating cGMP levels may improve cochlear microvascular perfusion, and thereby enhance nutrient and antioxidant delivery to hair cells. Thus, despite its well‐established clinical uses in vascular disorders, there is a potentially new indication in age‐related cochlear ischemia and metabolic insufficiency leading to sensorineural hearing loss (ElHady et al., 2023; Manna et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
Sildenafil’s clinical journey began with its approval in the late 1990s for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, evolving rapidly into a therapeutic mainstay in vascular modulation. Over subsequent years, its use was extended to pulmonary arterial hypertension, where its ability to enhance NO-mediated vasodilation produced measurable improvements in pulmonary hemodynamics. In these domains, sildenafil’s mechanism—rooted in the modulation of cGMP—has been extensively validated in both clinical and biochemical studies, and its pharmacokinetic profile, dosing regimens, and safety data have been well characterized in multiple patient populations. Despite this broad therapeutic history in vascular and pulmonary contexts, the application of sildenafil for auditory indications remains in its early stages. A systematic search of clinical trial registries using the query “AREA[InterventionName]sildenafil AND (AREA[Condition]""hearing loss"" OR AREA[Condition]""age-related hearing loss"" OR AREA[Condition]presbycusis)” returned no results, highlighting that no controlled clinical evaluations have been undertaken for its use in hearing loss (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical data in the auditory domain have yielded mixed outcomes. For instance, animal models have reported both protective and damaging effects on hearing following PDE5 inhibition. One set of studies indicates that sildenafil can modulate distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds under acute noise challenge conditions, suggesting that enhanced cochlear perfusion might confer protection against noise-induced hearing damage (Aljeraisi, 2024). Conversely, other investigations report histopathological damage to the organ of Corti, including cellular disorganization and degenerative changes following high-dose or prolonged sildenafil administration (Zittoon, 2022; Manna et al., 2019). Collectively, while sildenafil has a long and successful history in addressing vascular dysfunction, its use in treating age‐related hearing loss remains controversial and largely unexplored outside of experimental models (Manna et al., 2019; Tanaka et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, sildenafil acts as a competitive inhibitor of PDE5, thereby preventing the breakdown of intracellular cGMP. Normally, nitric oxide (NO) released from endothelial cells activates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) to catalyze the conversion of GTP to cGMP. Elevated cGMP activates downstream signaling via protein kinase G (PKG), which phosphorylates target proteins and leads to a cascade of events culminating in smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. This well-established mechanism is the cornerstone of sildenafil’s therapeutic effects in erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension (ElHady et al., 2023). In the cochlear context, key components of this pathway, including NO, sGC, cGMP, and PKG, are expressed in vascular structures such as the stria vascularis as well as in cochlear hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons. These findings suggest a potential role for increased cGMP in augmenting cochlear blood flow and thereby supporting cellular function (Manna et al., 2019). The hypothesis for repurposing sildenafil for age-related hearing loss builds upon this mechanistic framework: by elevating intracochlear cGMP, sildenafil could facilitate enhanced vasodilation within the stria vascularis, which would be expected to improve perfusion, nutrient delivery, and antioxidant access to metabolically stressed hair cells. Such improved blood–labyrinth barrier function may in turn mitigate ischemia-driven dysfunction of mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channels—a critical process in auditory signal conversion (ElHady et al., 2023; Manna et al., 2019).

However, it is important to note that while the amplification of cGMP signaling can yield beneficial vascular effects, several preclinical studies have raised concerns about potential adverse consequences. Excessive accumulation of cGMP may trigger pro-apoptotic pathways involving caspase-3 and p38 MAP kinases, leading to cellular toxicity and structural damage within the organ of Corti (Zittoon, 2022; Manna et al., 2019). These findings underscore a delicate therapeutic balance in which the beneficial vasodilatory and antioxidant-delivery effects of sildenafil must be carefully weighed against risks of ototoxicity. The dualism of the NO/cGMP pathway in the cochlea is further complicated by the context-dependent response of inner ear cells—where increased NO can, in some circumstances, result in oxidative damage and apoptosis rather than cytoprotection (Wester et al., 2018). Hence, while the established molecular interactions offer a robust rationale for the drug’s proposed protective effects in age-related hearing loss, they also point to the need for defining a narrow and precise therapeutic window to avoid off-target cytotoxic effects.

Expected Effect:
The therapeutic hypothesis posits that sildenafil will elevate intracochlear cGMP levels, leading to a cascade of improvements in cochlear microcirculation. Under normal aging conditions, a decline in cochlear blood flow contributes to energy deficits in hair cells, impairing their ability to maintain the endocochlear potential and the function of mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channels. By inhibiting PDE5, sildenafil is expected to result in sustained vasodilation within the stria vascularis. This vasodilation would increase perfusion and, consequently, improve the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and crucially, endogenous antioxidants. Elevated antioxidant delivery is hypothesized to protect against mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress that are implicated in the deterioration of MET channel function observed in age-related hearing loss (Aljeraisi, 2024; Wester et al., 2018).

From a functional perspective, the expected outcomes in preclinical assays would include stabilization or improvement in distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), which serve as sensitive indicators of outer hair cell integrity, as well as reduced auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold shifts after a cochlear insult. For example, some animal studies have noted that acute administration of sildenafil at doses approximating 10 mg/kg shows a decrease in noise-induced ABR threshold shifts, suggesting that improved cochlear perfusion can mitigate transient auditory damage (Aljeraisi, 2024; Wester et al., 2018). Biochemical endpoints may include decreased markers of oxidative stress and improved mitochondrial integrity in cochlear hair cells. In addition, the presence of key components of the NO/cGMP pathway, such as PKG and cGMP-dependent effectors in the cochlea, supports the hypothesis that sildenafil’s action could lead to meaningful enhancements in local blood flow and cellular homeostasis (Manna et al., 2019).

Moreover, it is anticipated that by bolstering vascular function and antioxidant delivery, sildenafil might preserve the structure and function of the organ of Corti. Histopathologic assessments in animal models could demonstrate improved cellular architecture in the stria vascularis and hair cells compared to untreated or ototoxin-exposed controls, even in the face of age-related degenerative processes. In this context, protective endpoints would include not only electrophysiological measures such as DPOAE and ABR but also biochemical assays for antioxidant enzyme activity and immunohistochemical markers of cochlear cell survival. The overall expected therapeutic effect, therefore, is a multifaceted improvement in cochlear function that simultaneously addresses the vascular insufficiency and oxidative stress that underlie age-related auditory decline.

Overall Evaluation:
Sildenafil presents as a highly intriguing and promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of age-related hearing loss, yet its ultimate clinical utility remains uncertain due to a complex interplay of beneficial and potentially deleterious effects. On the one hand, its well-established mechanism as a PDE5 inhibitor provides a clear scientific rationale for improving cochlear microcirculation. The extensive clinical validation in erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension, coupled with preclinical data indicating that acute sildenafil administration can reduce noise-induced ABR threshold shifts, lend support to the notion that enhancing NO/cGMP signaling can positively affect cochlear function (ElHady et al., 2023; Aljeraisi, 2024). The expected benefits—improved blood flow in the stria vascularis, enhanced delivery of endogenous antioxidants, and preservation of mitochondrial and hair cell function—are all mechanistically plausible and address key aspects of the pathophysiology of age-related hearing loss.

On the other hand, the dualistic nature of sildenafil’s action raises significant concerns. Several preclinical studies have reported that excessive or prolonged elevation of cGMP may lead to ototoxic effects, including histopathological damage in cochlear structures such as the organ of Corti. Documented findings of cellular disorganization, vacuolation, and nuclear degeneration in animal studies imply that if dosing is not carefully controlled, sildenafil may induce adverse auditory outcomes rather than confer protection (Zittoon, 2022; Manna et al., 2019). Moreover, clinical case reports and retrospective pharmacovigilance incidents have noted sudden sensorineural hearing loss associated with PDE5 inhibitor use, highlighting that the therapeutic window might be narrow in the delicate environment of the inner ear (Manna et al., 2019; Tanaka et al., 2019).

An additional challenge is the absence of clinical trial data addressing the use of sildenafil in auditory disorders. The current literature, as reflected in systematic clinical trial searches, shows no active or completed studies evaluating sildenafil specifically for age-related hearing loss or presbycusis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Consequently, the translational potential of sildenafil for this indication remains unverified, and its benefits observed in preclinical models (e.g., reductions in ABR threshold shifts in acute models) may not directly correlate with improvements in the chronic and multifactorial pathology of presbycusis.

Furthermore, the heterogeneity inherent in age-related hearing loss complicates the repurposing strategy. Presbycusis results from a confluence of factors—including cumulative noise exposure, genetic predisposition, and vascular insufficiency—so that a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to be effective. Sildenafil might benefit a subset of patients in whom reduced cochlear perfusion is the primary driver of hair cell degeneration. However, without the identification of predictive biomarkers and targeted patient stratification, clinical trials may yield equivocal outcomes.

Lastly, it is critical to emphasize that determining an optimal dosing regimen is paramount. While acute dosing in animal models has demonstrated some protective effects, the chronic dosing required for managing a progressive condition like age-related hearing loss could raise safety issues. Long-term administration studies, with meticulous monitoring of both auditory function (using electrophysiological assays such as ABR and DPOAE) and cochlear histopathology, are essential to ascertain that sildenafil does not inadvertently provoke ototoxicity through off-target effects of excessive cGMP elevation (Wester et al., 2018; Manna et al., 2019).

Overall, sildenafil emerges as a candidate with a sound mechanistic rationale—leveraging its established NO/cGMP-mediated vasodilatory effects to possibly restore cochlear perfusion, reduce oxidative stress, and support hair cell function in the aging ear. Its strengths lie in the well-documented efficacy of PDE5 inhibition in vascular disorders, the presence of relevant molecular targets in the cochlea, and promising preclinical evidence suggesting that improved blood flow may protect against transient auditory insults (ElHady et al., 2023; Aljeraisi, 2024). At the same time, considerable weaknesses and gaps in our current knowledge persist. The risk of ototoxicity, as indicated by both animal studies and adverse event reports, raises a cautionary flag; the absence of dedicated clinical trials leaves the safety and efficacy profile in the auditory domain largely uncharted; and the complexity of presbycusis as a multifactorial disease means that efficacy may be limited to specific subgroups of patients.

Given these factors, the overall evaluation of sildenafil as a therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss is one of guarded optimism. On balance, while the theoretical framework is biologically plausible and supported by select preclinical findings, the potential for deleterious cochlear effects underscores the necessity for rigorous dose-finding, safety studies, and well-controlled preclinical models before advancing to human clinical trials. Future experimental designs should incorporate comprehensive electrophysiological assessments (including ABR and DPOAE measurements), detailed histological evaluations of cochlear structures, and biochemical assays for oxidative stress and mitochondrial function. Such studies will be critical to delineate the precise therapeutic window in which sildenafil’s vasodilatory and antioxidant-delivery benefits outweigh its ototoxic risks. Moreover, combination therapeutic strategies involving sildenafil along with agents that bolster antioxidant defenses or stabilize the blood-labyrinth barrier might help widen this window and offer superior protection against age-related auditory decline.

In conclusion, while sildenafil’s established role as a PDE5 inhibitor and its ability to enhance NO/cGMP signaling provide a strong scientific rationale for its potential utility in mitigating ischemia-driven hearing loss, its dualistic effects on the cochlea necessitate a cautious and methodical approach. The absence of clinical trial data in the auditory field further mandates that future research focus intensively on preclinical safety and efficacy endpoints. Only with such a rigorous and structured investigation can the true therapeutic potential of sildenafil for age-related hearing loss be determined, balancing its promise to rescue hair cell function via improved microvascular perfusion against the inherent risks of ototoxicity observed in some models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ElHady et al., 2023; Wester et al., 2018).

GSK2606414,"Proposal for GSK2606414

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
GSK2606414 is a fully synthetic, small-molecule inhibitor originally discovered through efforts to target the unfolded protein response (UPR) at the level of its sensor, PERK (protein kinase RNA‐like endoplasmic reticulum kinase). This compound was developed by GlaxoSmithKline and belongs to the class of PERK inhibitors that have become instrumental in investigating the molecular consequences of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in neurodegenerative disease models. The synthesis of GSK2606414 involved high-throughput screening methods of chemical libraries with subsequent optimization for potency, selectivity, and in vivo bioavailability. Within the context of drug discovery, the PERK inhibitor class has traditionally been applied in preclinical models of neurodegeneration—such as models of Parkinson’s disease, prion disease, Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome, frontotemporal dementia, and tauopathies—where chronic ER stress and UPR hyperactivation drive cell death. As such, GSK2606414 stands as a prototype compound among PERK inhibitors (Gundu et al., 2022; Grande et al., 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, GSK2606414 has been explored extensively in the realm of neurodegenerative research. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in a number of preclinical studies where inhibition of the PERK pathway led to decreased phosphorylation of eIF2α and reduced levels of downstream pro-apoptotic factors such as ATF4 and CHOP. For instance, in models of high glucose-induced neurotoxicity, treatment with GSK2606414 significantly attenuated the PERK/p-eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP signaling cascade and improved mitochondrial function in mouse neuroblastoma (N2A) cells (Gundu et al., 2022). In mouse models of Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome and tauopathies, chronic administration of GSK2606414 resulted in neuroprotection, delayed motor deficits, and preservation of neuronal integrity (Grande et al., 2018). Despite these promising findings in neurodegeneration, a search on ClinicalTrials.gov for GSK2606414 or PERK inhibitors in the context of hearing loss has returned no registered clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). To date, there is no direct evidence from clinical or preclinical studies addressing Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) per se; however, the common pathogenic mechanism of chronic ER stress—leading to CHOP-mediated apoptosis—has been implicated in cochlear hair cell degeneration in ARHL and noise-induced hearing loss (Li et al., 2024). Thus, while GSK2606414 has a rich history in neuroprotective studies, its repurposing for ARHL remains an untested but mechanistically plausible hypothesis.

Mechanism of Action:
GSK2606414 operates by selectively binding to the kinase domain of PERK, thereby inhibiting its autophosphorylation and subsequent downstream signaling. Under conditions of ER stress, PERK becomes activated and phosphorylates eIF2α (eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha), a modification that results in global translational attenuation. This reduction in protein synthesis is initially adaptive, as it decreases the influx of nascent proteins into a stressed ER. However, prolonged activation of PERK leads to sustained eIF2α phosphorylation, increased translation of ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4), and ultimately induction of CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), a pro-apoptotic transcription factor (Gundu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2024). CHOP plays a pivotal role in ER stress-induced apoptosis by upregulating pro-apoptotic genes, downregulating anti-apoptotic factors such as Bcl-2, and contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction through further generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In several neurodegeneration studies, administration of GSK2606414 has been shown to reduce levels of phosphorylated PERK, eIF2α, ATF4, and CHOP, thereby mitigating apoptotic signaling and improving cell survival (Grande et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2015). Furthermore, by alleviating translational repression, GSK2606414 helps restore normal protein synthesis rates which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis, including the biogenesis and function of mitochondria—a process that is particularly important in energy-demanding cells such as neurons and auditory hair cells (Gundu et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
In the context of Age-Related Hearing Loss, the hypothesis is that chronic ER stress in aged cochlear hair cells triggers the PERK-eIF2α-CHOP pathway, leading to apoptosis and loss of mechanotransduction (MET) channel integrity. The expected effect of GSK2606414 is to attenuate the hyperactivation of this signaling cascade in cochlear hair cells. By inhibiting PERK, the drug would reduce eIF2α phosphorylation, thereby diminishing the upregulation of ATF4 and subsequent CHOP-mediated apoptotic signaling. This reduction in ER stress-induced apoptosis is expected to preserve the viability of cochlear hair cells and maintain the structural and functional integrity of the mechanotransduction channels, which are essential for auditory signal transduction (Li et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2016). Experimental data in neurodegeneration models have already shown that treatment with GSK2606414 at doses around 50 mg/kg can lower markers of ER stress and promote cell survival (Grande et al., 2018). Although direct preclinical evidence in auditory models is lacking, mechanistic parallels exist: similar to neuronal cells, cochlear hair cells are highly susceptible to ER stress-mediated apoptosis, as evidenced by increased CHOP expression in models of noise-induced and genetically driven hearing loss (Hu et al., 2016; Kalinec et al., 2014). Moreover, preservation of mitochondrial function by GSK2606414, through upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis markers, could further enhance cell survival in the metabolically active hair cells (Gundu et al., 2022). Thus, the drug is anticipated to act by downregulating maladaptive UPR signaling—thereby preventing CHOP-mediated apoptosis and preserving mechanotransduction channel architecture—which may translate into functional protection against ARHL.

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, GSK2606414 represents a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss due to its well-documented role in modulating ER stress and UPR signaling. The strengths of this therapeutic candidate include a robust mechanistic rationale: chronic ER stress leading to activation of the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP axis is a shared pathological feature in both neurodegeneration and cochlear hair cell loss. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated that GSK2606414 can decrease phosphorylation of PERK and its downstream effectors, thereby reducing pro-apoptotic signaling and rescuing cell survival in models of high glucose-induced neurotoxicity and mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases (Gundu et al., 2022; Grande et al., 2018). Given that auditory hair cells in the aging cochlea are particularly vulnerable to ER stress-induced apoptosis, inhibition of PERK by GSK2606414 may be a viable strategy to preserve these cells and maintain mechanotransduction channel functionality. Additionally, neuroprotection achieved in models of Parkinson’s disease and frontotemporal dementia further supports the potential utility of this compound in mitigating cellular loss due to chronic ER stress (Mercado et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2015).

However, significant weaknesses and challenges must also be considered. A major concern is the dual role of PERK signaling: while its chronic activation can lead to detrimental apoptosis via CHOP induction, the PERK pathway also has an adaptive function by attenuating protein load during acute ER stress. Therefore, complete inhibition of PERK may impair its protective aspects, which could lead to unforeseen negative cellular outcomes, particularly in tissues where a balanced UPR is critical (Athanasiou et al., 2017; Li et al., 2024). Additionally, side effects observed in neurodegenerative models—including pancreatic toxicity, weight loss, and off-target effects on kinases such as RIPK1—raise concerns about the long-term safety of GSK2606414 (Rozpędek-Kamińska et al., 2020; Mercado et al., 2018). The lack of any current clinical trials specifically targeting hearing loss with this compound further underscores the need for cautious preclinical evaluation in auditory models before moving to clinical stages (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Moreover, the specific dosing regimen, pharmacokinetics, and tissue distribution of GSK2606414 in the inner ear remain to be elucidated. While certain dosing paradigms (e.g., approximately 50 mg/kg in mice) have shown efficacy in reducing ER stress markers in neural models (Grande et al., 2018), the cochlea has unique anatomical and physiological properties that may demand a different therapeutic window. There is also the possibility that inhibiting PERK might inadvertently disrupt the delicate balance between pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signals in the aging cochlea, where the UPR is already dysregulated as part of the aging process (Li et al., 2024; Ege et al., 2024).

In conclusion, GSK2606414 holds significant promise as a candidate for repurposing in Age-Related Hearing Loss due to its targeted mechanism of attenuating the PERK-mediated arm of the UPR, thereby reducing CHOP-driven apoptosis and potentially preserving both cochlear hair cell viability and mechanotransduction channel integrity. The biochemical rationale is supported by extensive preclinical studies in neurodegenerative models showing that inhibition of PERK improves cellular survival and function (Gundu et al., 2022; Grande et al., 2018). Nevertheless, several critical challenges—including the potential for off-target toxicity, the dual nature of PERK signaling, and the lack of direct data in auditory systems—must be addressed through rigorous preclinical studies using relevant ARHL models. In parallel, alternative strategies such as modulating downstream effectors (for instance, the use of agents like ISRIB which act further downstream and may have a reduced toxicity profile) should be considered. Overall, while GSK2606414 is mechanistically attractive for combating ER stress-induced damage in aging hair cells, its translation to clinical application in ARHL will require careful dose optimization, side-effect profiling, and targeted delivery assessments to ensure that the beneficial effects on hair cell survival are not offset by detrimental systemic toxicity (Mercado et al., 2018; Park et al., 2024).

Q-VD-OPh,"Proposal for Q-VD-OPh

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Q-VD-OPh (quinolyl-valyl-OPh, SelleckChem #S7861) is a synthetic broad‐spectrum caspase inhibitor designed to counteract apoptosis via irreversible inhibition of caspase enzymes. It was developed as an advancement over earlier peptide‐based caspase inhibitors, such as those employing fluoromethylketone (FMK) reactive groups, which had issues with off‐target effects and toxicity. Q-VD-OPh incorporates a quinoline moiety at the N terminus that replaces the traditional benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) group found in older inhibitors; this structural modification enhances hydrophobicity and cell membrane permeability, thereby improving its cellular uptake and overall potency while reducing cytotoxicity (Adamova et al., 2015; Chauvier et al., 2007). As a synthetic small molecule, Q-VD-OPh belongs to the class of pan-caspase inhibitors, a group of compounds specifically designed to irreversibly bind to the active-site cysteine in caspases and halt the cascade of caspase-mediated apoptosis. Historically, broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors have been widely employed in experimental models to study apoptosis in various contexts including neurodegeneration, ischemia–reperfusion injury, and inflammatory pathology, which underscores their utility as research tools in both basic and translational biomedical studies (Antar et al., 2009; Bricker, 2012).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of Q-VD-OPh and its related class of compounds is marked by extensive experimental application across multiple disease models where apoptosis plays a central role. Early broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors were synthesized as peptide-based pseudosubstrates to inhibit caspases and have been applied in numerous studies ranging from neuroprotection in spinal cord injury and cerebral ischemia to mitigating apoptotic cell death in neurodegenerative animal models such as those for Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases (Antar et al., 2009; Chauvier et al., 2007). In particular, Q-VD-OPh has been recognized for its enhanced potency and improved pharmacokinetic profile compared to earlier inhibitors like Z-VAD-fmk, largely due to its improved cell permeability and lower toxicity profile; it has been successfully used in animal models of stroke, neurodegenerative disorders, and traumatic injuries where rapid caspase activation leads to significant cell loss (Keoni & Brown, 2015; Rohn, 2010). While broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors have been extensively evaluated for central nervous system (CNS) protection and for reducing apoptotic damage in models of Alzheimer’s disease (where they have been shown to inhibit caspase-mediated tau cleavage and other neuronal death pathways), direct clinical application for age-related hearing loss (ARHL) or presbycusis has not been reported in human clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, in cochlear explant models and ototoxicity studies, similar inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in preventing hair cell death induced by drugs such as cisplatin or aminoglycosides, thereby providing a rationale for exploring Q-VD-OPh for hearing preservation (Abi-Hachem et al., 2010; Op de Beeck et al., 2011).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Q-VD-OPh exerts its effects by irreversibly binding to the active site cysteine of various caspases, including initiator caspases like caspase-8 and ‑9 as well as effector caspases such as caspase-3, ‑6, and ‑7. By targeting these enzymes, Q-VD-OPh effectively blocks the proteolytic cascade that normally leads to apoptosis, thus preventing cleavage of critical substrates such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and other downstream effectors that drive the morphological and biochemical features of cell death (Chauvier et al., 2007; Keoni & Brown, 2015). The quinoline group in Q-VD-OPh not only contributes to its improved membrane permeability but also provides enhanced protection against metabolic degradation, ensuring that it remains stable and active within the cellular environment (Adamova et al., 2015). Additionally, Q-VD-OPh has been described as having a broad-spectrum inhibitory profile with IC₅₀ values in the low nanomolar range for several caspases, such as caspase-3 and caspase-7, which is critical given the role of these caspases in executing apoptosis in various tissues (Eaton et al., 2009). Importantly, the detailed biochemical characterization confirms that Q-VD-OPh’s mechanism involves covalent binding via its electrophilic warhead that inactivates the cysteine protease activity of caspases, thereby inhibiting programmed cell death not only in neurons but potentially in other cell types including cochlear hair cells (Rohn, 2010).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, it is expected that Q-VD-OPh, when applied at concentrations in the range of 20–50 μM, will inhibit caspase activity in aging cochlear hair cells, thereby preventing the caspase-mediated apoptotic cascade that contributes to hair cell loss. This preservation of hair cell viability is predicted to maintain the mechanotransduction (MET) channel density and proper mechanical gating properties of the remaining cells, which are crucial for effective auditory function. Prior research has shown in cochlear explant models that caspase inhibitors can prevent ototoxin-induced hair cell death, suggesting that the anti-apoptotic action of Q-VD-OPh may similarly protect against the intrinsic apoptotic pathways activated in age-related conditions (Op de Beeck et al., 2011; Mukherjea et al., 2011). In aging cochlear tissues, intrinsic stress and mitochondrial dysfunction often lead to the activation of caspases—particularly caspase-3/7—which then trigger apoptosis and result in decline in mechanotransduction function. By blocking these apoptotic signals, Q-VD-OPh is anticipated to help preserve the integrity of the sensory epithelium and maintain the function of hair cells critical for auditory transduction (Wang & Puel, 2020). Furthermore, considering that Q-VD-OPh has been shown to maintain cell viability in other systems without cytotoxic off-target effects, its application in a controlled in vitro or ex vivo model of ARHL may demonstrate marked preservation of both hair cell survival and functional mechanotransduction capabilities, thereby providing a targeted anti-apoptotic therapeutic strategy for mitigating age-related hearing loss (Keoni & Brown, 2015; Kuželová et al., 2011).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, Q-VD-OPh presents several strengths as a promising candidate for repurposing toward the treatment of Age-Related Hearing Loss. Its synthetic nature and rational chemical design make it an attractive member of the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor class, with documented improvements in potency, cell permeability, and a favorable toxicity profile compared to earlier analogs such as Z-VAD-fmk (Adamova et al., 2015; Chauvier et al., 2007). The compound’s extensive use in neuroprotection and apoptosis inhibition in animal models of CNS injury, stroke, neurodegeneration, and even Alzheimer’s disease provides compelling evidence for its utility in conditions where apoptosis is a key pathological mechanism (Antar et al., 2009; Rohn, 2010). Specific to the context of age-related hearing loss, the underlying pathophysiology involves the activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathways leading to the loss of cochlear hair cells; thus, a compound like Q-VD-OPh that can efficiently block caspase activity is expected to preserve hair cell viability and maintain mechanotransduction function, as shown in cochlear explant and ototoxin-induced models (Mukherjea et al., 2015; Op de Beeck et al., 2011).

However, several weaknesses and challenges remain. First, while preclinical studies in neurodegeneration and cochlear explant models show promise, there is a lack of direct evidence from in vivo studies or clinical trials on the application of Q-VD-OPh specifically for age-related hearing loss, meaning that further systematic research is needed to establish optimal dosing regimens, pharmacokinetics within the inner ear, and long-term safety in the aged population (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, although the inhibitor has been shown to have low toxicity in neuronal systems, it is critical to evaluate whether prolonged inhibition of caspases might interfere with physiological cellular processes in the cochlea that also require controlled apoptosis for tissue homeostasis or regeneration (Keoni & Brown, 2015; Kuželová et al., 2011). Finally, because age-related hearing loss is a multifactorial condition not exclusively driven by apoptosis—encompassing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory changes—the use of a caspase inhibitor may need to be integrated into a broader therapeutic strategy that addresses these additional pathological mechanisms (Abi-Hachem et al., 2010; Wang & Puel, 2020).

Overall, the concept of repurposing Q-VD-OPh as an anti-apoptotic agent in the context of ARHL is scientifically sound and supported by a substantial body of experimental data in related fields. The compound’s ability to inhibit multiple caspases, protect against apoptotic cell death, and preserve function in models of neurodegeneration and ototoxicity all contribute to its potential attractiveness as a therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss. Nevertheless, rigorous preclinical studies specifically in animal models that recapitulate the gradual cochlear cell loss observed with aging are essential before advancing to clinical testing. Direct examinations of hair cell survival, MET channel density, and functional auditory outcomes in such models, as well as assessments of potential systemic side effects from long-term caspase inhibition in the elderly, will be necessary to validate the promise of Q-VD-OPh for ARHL (Abi-Hachem et al., 2010; Keoni & Brown, 2015; Rohn, 2010).

In conclusion, we believe that Q-VD-OPh represents a strong candidate based on its biochemical efficacy and broad applicability in apoptosis-related pathologies; however, its direct application to age-related hearing loss will require further targeted investigation, particularly regarding its impact on the specialized physiology of cochlear hair cells and overall auditory function in aged models. The strengths of its molecular mechanism and previous preclinical success in related domains are balanced by the necessity for additional data addressing pharmacodynamics, potential off-target interactions in the cochlea, and integration with multi-factorial therapeutic strategies for ARHL (Adamova et al., 2015; Antar et al., 2009; Mukherjea et al., 2015).

Apocynin,"Proposal for Apocynin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Apocynin (4‐hydroxy‐3‐methoxyacetophenone) is a naturally derived phenolic compound originally isolated from various plant species such as those in the Apocynum genus and from Picrorhiza kurroa, which has historical usage in traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine. As a member of a class of phytochemicals with antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties, apocynin was discovered owing to its ability to attenuate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by inhibiting NADPH oxidase activity. The compound is typically classified as an NADPH oxidase inhibitor and is believed to interfere with enzyme complex assembly, particularly by preventing the translocation of critical cytosolic components such as p47^phox to the membrane‐bound catalytic subunit (gp91^phox or NOX2). Its origin from naturally sourced compounds and subsequent chemical synthesis or extraction has led to extensive evaluation in various models of oxidative stress and inflammatory diseases. In this context, apocynin belongs to a broader therapeutic class of small molecule antioxidants that have been repurposed in various preclinical investigations, with early studies focusing on its effects in reducing oxidative stress in vascular, neurological, and inflammatory conditions (Stefanska & Pawliczak, 2008; ’t Hart et al., 2014).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, apocynin has been evaluated predominantly in preclinical animal models and cellular systems for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It has been used to target NADPH oxidase activity in various tissues, especially in models of ischemic injury, neurodegeneration, and vascular inflammation. For instance, its ability to reduce NADPH oxidase–mediated generation of ROS has been shown to confer neuroprotection in experimental models of stroke and Parkinson’s disease, where it acts by dampening microglial activation and subsequent oxidative stress (Simonyi, 2012; ’t Hart et al., 2014). In addition, apocynin has been examined in models of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, where oxidative stress derived from NADPH oxidase activity contributes to cochlear damage; however, while many studies have focused on the role of NOX3 and other related isoforms in the inner ear, direct clinical assessments or comprehensive preclinical studies of apocynin specifically for age-related hearing loss (ARHL) remain limited (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rose et al., 2024). Although preliminary data indirectly support the idea that reducing NADPH oxidase–mediated ROS generation may be beneficial in auditory disorders, there is as yet no robust clinical evidence demonstrating its efficacy in ARHL (Simonyi, 2012; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, apocynin exerts its effects primarily through the inhibition of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex. NADPH oxidases are multi-subunit enzymes responsible for transferring electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen, thereby generating superoxide anions (O2•–) and other reactive oxygen species. In its inactive state, NADPH oxidase exists as separate membrane-bound and cytosolic subunits. Activation requires the assembly of these subunits—especially the translocation of cytosolic components such as p47^phox, p67^phox, and the small GTPase Rac—to the membrane-bound catalytic subunit (gp91^phox) and its partner p22^phox. Apocynin is proposed to act as a prodrug that, upon activation by myeloperoxidase (MPO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), undergoes oxidative dimerization to form diapocynin. Diapocynin is thought to interfere with the proper assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex, effectively preventing the formation of the active enzyme and thereby reducing the production of ROS (Stefanska & Pawliczak, 2008; Simonyi, 2012).
In several cell types, particularly in phagocytes and microglia, apocynin’s inhibition of NADPH oxidase leads to a marked decrease in the generation of superoxide and downstream ROS, thereby mitigating oxidative damage and suppressing pro-inflammatory signaling pathways such as those mediated by NF-κB and MAPK cascades (’t Hart et al., 2014; Stefanska & Pawliczak, 2008). In vascular and neurological contexts, apocynin has been shown to protect lipid rafts and cytoskeletal elements by decreasing oxidative modifications, which is particularly relevant since these structures are critical for the proper function of mechanotransduction (MET) channels and associated proteins such as TMC1 and TMC2 in cochlear hair cells (Herb, 2024; Meng et al., 2025).
The collective biochemical and molecular studies suggest that apocynin’s primary mode of action is to attenuate NADPH oxidase-derived ROS formation—a mechanism that is hypothesized to be beneficial in tissues where oxidative damage is a key driver of pathology, such as in aging cochlear cells (Stefanska & Pawliczak, 2008; Simonyi, 2012).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for repurposing apocynin in age-related hearing loss hinges on its ability to reduce excessive ROS production in the cochlea and thereby mitigate oxidative damage. Age-related hearing loss has been associated with the upregulation of NADPH oxidase isoforms, particularly NOX2 and NOX4, in cochlear tissues. This upregulation leads to increased ROS production that damages critical structures, including outer and inner hair cells, supporting cells, and the mechanotransduction apparatus of the cochlea (Herb, 2024; Li, 2010).
In this proposed mechanism, apocynin would act by blocking the assembly of NADPH oxidase complexes in aging cochlear hair cells, thereby diminishing the rate of ROS generation. A reduction in ROS is expected to prevent the oxidative damage inflicted on cell membranes, mitochondria, and cytoskeletal elements. These structures, particularly lipid rafts and cytoskeletal proteins, are essential in maintaining the proper gating of the MET channels and the function of TMC1/TMC2 proteins, which are central to the conversion of mechanical stimuli into neural signals. The preservation of mechanotransduction currents is critical for auditory function, and by lowering the oxidative burden at the plasma membrane and mitochondrial interfaces, apocynin is anticipated to preserve these functions (Herb, 2024; Meng et al., 2025).
Experimental assays that monitor ROS levels, cellular viability, and mechanotransduction currents in cochlear explant models or hair cell lines (e.g., UB-OC-1 cells) would be expected to show that administration of apocynin leads to lower levels of oxidative markers, enhanced cell survival, and preservation of MET channel function. Additionally, animal models of age-related hearing loss could be used to assess auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds and cochlear morphology, with the expectation that apocynin-treated groups would exhibit reduced threshold shifts and better preservation of hair cell architecture (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Herb, 2024).
It is noteworthy, however, that while the proposed mechanism is supported by evidence from cisplatin-induced ototoxicity models and general studies on NADPH oxidase inhibitors, direct mechanistic studies regarding the protection of MET channels and TMC1/TMC2 gating by apocynin are still sparse. Therefore, further studies are needed to explicitly link the reduction of oxidative stress by apocynin with the preservation of mechanotransduction function in the auditory system (Li, 2010; Herb, 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Apocynin represents a compelling candidate for repurposing in age-related hearing loss due to several key strengths. Its natural origin and established safety profile in animal models, coupled with its oral bioavailability and low toxicity, make it an attractive candidate for long-term therapeutic use in chronic age-related disorders. The extensive body of biochemical literature demonstrates that apocynin effectively inhibits NADPH oxidase, thereby reducing ROS generation and mitigating oxidative stress—a central mechanism implicated in the degeneration of cochlear hair cells and the decline of mechanotransduction in the aging auditory system (Stefanska & Pawliczak, 2008; ’t Hart et al., 2014).
The preclinical evidence, mostly derived from models of vascular and neurodegenerative diseases, strongly supports the notion that minimizing NADPH oxidase-derived ROS can lead to significant neuroprotection and preservation of cellular functions. In the context of the cochlea, studies have shown that NOX enzymes, particularly NOX3, play a pivotal role in mediating oxidative stress in response to insults such as noise and ototoxic drugs (Rose et al., 2024; Herb, 2024).
Despite these promising aspects, there are notable weaknesses and gaps that must be addressed. First, while apocynin’s efficacy in reducing ROS is well established in various models, its specific effects on the auditory system—especially in relation to mechanotransduction (MET) channels and TMC1/TMC2 gating—remain to be definitively demonstrated. Some studies in cochlear explant models have produced mixed results regarding the ability of NADPH oxidase inhibitors to prevent apoptosis, suggesting that the relationship between ROS reduction and cellular survival in the complex inner ear environment may involve additional mechanisms (Li, 2010). Second, although apocynin has been shown to be effective at concentrations between 10–50 μM in vitro, there is a need for comprehensive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies specifically in cochlear tissues to establish the optimal dosing regimen for therapeutic efficacy in age-related contexts. Third, the majority of the current literature on apocynin has been conducted in models of acute oxidative injury or inflammation, whereas age-related hearing loss is a gradual process involving chronic oxidative stress, accumulated damage, and altered cellular repair mechanisms. As such, long-term studies are required to evaluate whether apocynin can not only reduce ROS levels but also provide sustained protection to hair cells and preserve mechanotransduction over time (Simonyi, 2012; Herb, 2024).
Furthermore, the complexity of NADPH oxidase regulation in non-phagocytic cells, such as cochlear hair cells, introduces potential variability in the response to apocynin. There is evidence that apocynin’s effects can be context-dependent, sometimes even leading to oxidative stimulation in certain non-phagocytic cells (’t Hart et al., 2014). This ambiguity necessitates careful monitoring of oxidative markers and cellular outcomes in cochlear-specific studies. Finally, while the reduction of ROS is an attractive target, age-related hearing loss is a multifactorial disorder involving genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors. The contribution of oxidative stress, though significant, may not wholly account for the progressive functional decline, and combinatorial therapeutic strategies might be necessary for effective treatment.
In summary, apocynin is a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss given its demonstrated ability to inhibit NADPH oxidase activity and reduce ROS generation, its favorable pharmacokinetic profile, and its established safety in preclinical models. However, significant gaps in the direct evidence of its efficacy in auditory-specific contexts—especially regarding preservation of MET channel function and long-term protection against chronic oxidative damage—highlight the need for further comprehensive biochemical, cellular, and in vivo auditory studies before advancing to clinical trials. The strengths include robust mechanistic rationale and previous successful applications in oxidative stress–related diseases, while the weaknesses revolve around the limited direct evidence in the cochlear context and the complexities of translating acute antioxidant effects into long-term protection in age-related conditions (Li, 2010; Herb, 2024; Simonyi, 2012).

S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP),"Proposal for S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) is a synthetic S-nitrosothiol derived from N-acetylpenicillamine via nitrosation, and it belongs to the nitric oxide (NO) donor class of compounds. SNAP has long been used as a chemical tool to deliver NO in a controlled manner in vitro and in ex vivo systems. The compound is synthetically made by reacting N-acetylpenicillamine with a nitrosating agent, yielding a stable S-nitrosothiol that decomposes to release NO under physiological conditions (Chipinda, 2007; Bryan, 2011). As a member of the S-nitrosothiol class, SNAP is known to mimic transient, endogenous NO signaling events by delivering low concentrations of NO; in many studies it has been used to elucidate the role of NO in modulating vascular tone, neurotransmission, and redox signaling. This class of compounds has historically been applied primarily in experimental biochemical studies, and yet their potential clinical translation remains under active investigation, especially given the dual nature (protective versus toxic) of NO signaling within sensitive tissues such as the cochlea.

Therapeutic History:
The literature shows that SNAP has predominantly been used as an experimental NO donor in numerous biochemical and preclinical studies aiming to decipher the effects of NO on cochlear physiology. For example, several studies have used SNAP to model NO‐induced ototoxicity in cochlear explants and isolated hair cell systems (Kim et al., 2012; Jung et al., 2003). SNAP has been effectively employed to mimic the conditions of excessive NO production—conditions that have been implicated in hair cell apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory signaling via NF-κB and caspase activation (Kim et al., 2012; Hanson et al., 2003). Despite its widespread use as a model compound for studying nitric oxide’s cytotoxic effects in the inner ear, there is little evidence in the literature that SNAP has ever been employed clinically or even preclinically as a therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss (ARHL) or similar degenerative auditory diseases. Clinical trial searches combining terms such as “SNAP,” “nitric oxide donor,” and “age-related hearing loss” reveal a large number of studies assessing NO donors in hearing disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), although these appear primarily exploratory. The majority of these studies suggest that while NO donors may modulate cochlear microcirculation and inflammatory pathways, SNAP itself – when used at high doses – is more often associated with damaging effects on hair cell viability rather than any cytoprotective benefit. Hence, the repurposing hypothesis for ARHL would require rigorous optimization of dosage and release kinetics in order to shift SNAP’s profile from an ototoxic agent to a protector of hair cell function.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, SNAP acts by decomposing to release nitric oxide in a controlled fashion. NO, a highly diffusible free radical, acts as a second messenger by stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), thereby catalyzing the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Elevated cGMP levels activate protein kinases and phosphodiesterases that promote vasodilation and regulate ion channel conductance, ultimately influencing cellular processes such as muscle relaxation and neurotransmission (Bryan, 2011; Smith, 2010). In the context of the cochlea, it is hypothesized that the NO released from SNAP could activate the sGC/cGMP pathway in cells of the microvasculature, thereby improving blood flow to the sensitive hair cells and mitigating ischemic insults. Additionally, controlled NO signaling is known to possess anti-inflammatory effects; by modulating redox-sensitive proteins and potentially inhibiting the activation of inflammatory mediators such as the NLRP3 inflammasome, NO donors might reduce inflammation-mediated cellular damage (Kim et al., 2012). However, the same molecular interactions confer dual potential: while low-level NO release can stimulate protective vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory pathways, excessive NO—especially when delivered without strict kinetic control—can lead to the formation of peroxynitrite and other reactive nitrogen species. These, in turn, cause oxidative damage to mitochondrial membranes, activate caspase-1 and caspase-3, disrupt hair cell arrangement, and ultimately lead to apoptosis (Kim et al., 2012; Jung et al., 2003). The literature also documents that NO donors such as SNAP can influence other signaling pathways in auditory cells, including NF-κB activation and modulation of ion channel gating (Smith, 2010; Lee, 2009). Thus, while the central therapeutic hypothesis relies on the activation of sGC/cGMP and subsequent protective microcirculation improvements, the balance is precarious because of the risk that even slight over-release of NO might pivot the effect toward cytotoxicity rather than beneficial modulation.

Expected Effect:
The proposal hypothesizes that by administering SNAP at low, controlled concentrations (e.g., a concentration in the region of 50 μM based on preliminary cochlear explant data), it will produce a low but sustained level of NO within the aging cochlea. This controlled release is expected to activate the sGC/cGMP pathway, resulting in enhanced microcirculation via vasodilation. Improved blood flow should theoretically ameliorate aspects of blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB) dysfunction, which is associated with age-related degeneration of cochlear structures. Moreover, NO at these controlled levels might suppress inflammatory responses by modulating cellular redox states, inhibiting excessive activation of pro-inflammatory mediators such as the NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as decreasing caspase-1 activation and subsequent inflammatory cytokine release (Kim et al., 2012). In cochlear explant models, evidence suggests that low-dose SNAP treatment correlates with increased cGMP accumulation and preservation of auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds after ischemic or inflammatory insults, which implies some degree of protection for hair cell mechanotransduction (Kim et al., 2012). Additionally, by maintaining appropriate MET (mechanotransduction) channel function, controlled NO signaling might preserve the fidelity of sound transduction, ultimately slowing the progression of ARHL. It is important to note, however, that most data in this context come from SNAP’s use as a stress-inducing agent, meaning that the precise dosing and kinetic tailoring required for therapeutic benefit have not been fully established. Furthermore, while many auditory structures express NOS isoforms and sGC components (as supported by studies on cochlear hair cells and auditory neurons, e.g., Smith, 2010; Lee, 2009), the shift from a damaging to a protective role would necessitate an exacting optimization of SNAP’s release profile and local concentration.

Overall Evaluation:
SNAP offers an intriguing potential avenue for the treatment of age-related hearing loss owing to its well-documented biochemical action as an NO donor. The therapeutic candidate’s fundamental strength lies in its capacity to modulate several key pathways implicated in cochlear health. In theory, low-level NO release via controlled SNAP delivery could activate the sGC/cGMP pathway, thereby improving local microcirculation, reducing ischemia, and promoting vasodilation—effects that are highly relevant given that cochlear blood flow deficits contribute significantly to ARHL (Bryan, 2011; Smith, 2010). Additionally, the anti-inflammatory potential of NO, if properly harnessed, could inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation and mitigate inflammatory cascades that lead to hair cell apoptosis (Kim et al., 2012). This multi-targeted approach is conceptually attractive since age-related hearing loss is a multifactorial condition characterized by impaired microvascular dynamics, oxidative stress, and inflammatory damage that disrupts hair cell mechanotransduction.

However, the overall evaluation must also acknowledge significant weaknesses. The bulk of preclinical literature involving SNAP in cochlear models reveals that SNAP is more commonly used to induce ototoxicity via excessive NO release rather than to confer protection (Kim et al., 2012; Jung et al., 2003; Hanson et al., 2003). In multiple studies, even relatively modest doses of SNAP have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species, activation of caspases, and disruption of hair cell structure (Kim et al., 2012; Jung et al., 2003). This suggests a very narrow therapeutic window, where the line between beneficial and deleterious effects is exceedingly thin. Additionally, much of the evidence does not directly support a positive impact of SNAP on age-related hearing loss; rather, it indicates that SNAP is better described as a tool compound for modeling NO-mediated injury. The risk remains that even low-level NO release might inadvertently trigger harmful pathways, such as peroxynitrite formation and subsequent oxidative damage, if the rate of NO release is not exquisitely controlled (Hanson et al., 2003; Smith, 2010).

Another important consideration is the delivery mechanism. For SNAP to exert its potential protective effects in the aging cochlea, it must be delivered in a way that targets the cochlear microenvironment without causing systemic hypotension or other off-target effects. This is a non-trivial challenge given the intrinsic reactivity of NO and the diverse expression of sGC/cGMP components in various tissues (Bryan, 2011). Moreover, there is scant direct clinical evidence that modulating NO signaling via SNAP is beneficial in age-related hearing loss; most clinical trials involving NO donors have not specifically validated SNAP for this purpose, and preclinical models have yet to demonstrate a clear protective effect when moving from a damaging to a therapeutic paradigm (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In summary, despite the theoretical appeal of using SNAP to improve cochlear microcirculation, modulate inflammatory responses, and preserve hair cell function via sGC/cGMP signaling, the available preclinical evidence suggests that its current usage is more aligned with inducing ototoxicity rather than providing otoprotection. The strengths lie in its ability to target multiple biological pathways integral to cochlear health, but the weaknesses—particularly its propensity to cause oxidative and inflammatory damage when mis‐dosed—are significant hurdles that must be overcome. Further research is essential to precisely calibrate SNAP’s NO release kinetics, establish a reliable dosing regimen, and design targeted delivery systems that confine its action to the cochlea. Only then, with robust preclinical data demonstrating a net protective effect, could SNAP be considered a viable therapeutic candidate for age-related hearing loss (Kim et al., 2012; Hanson et al., 2003; Lee, 2009).
