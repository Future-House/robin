Assay Overview:
This assay proposes screening NAD⁺ precursors or glycolysis modulators using hair cell–like organoids derived from cochlear tissue. The fundamental idea is to evaluate drugs that may enhance metabolic competence in cochlear cells by measuring cellular ATP levels using a luminescence-based assay. In this system, ATP—an essential surrogate marker for cellular energy metabolism—is quantified rapidly and robustly. The assay models a critical aspect of Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) pathogenesis: the age-associated decline in cellular energy homeostasis that compromises hair cell function. The primary readout is the ATP concentration within the organoids after treatment with candidate compounds, which allows for a functional assessment of metabolic support. The biological material used includes in vitro organoid models that recapitulate key features of cochlear hair cells and supporting metabolic pathways (liu2024metabolicprofilingof pages 1-2).

Biomedical Evidence:
Mounting evidence indicates that impaired energy metabolism, marked by reductions in NAD⁺ and ATP levels, is central to ARHL pathogenesis. With aging, cochlear cells exhibit a decline in mitochondrial function, resulting in diminished ATP production—which is crucial for the bioenergetic demands of hair cell transduction and survival. NAD⁺, in particular, plays a dual role in energy production and cellular stress response; its depletion leads to reduced activity of NAD⁺-dependent enzymes such as sirtuins and PARPs, exacerbating oxidative stress and cell senescence (ege2024theroleof pages 13-14). Supplementation studies using NAD⁺ precursors like nicotinamide riboside (NR) have demonstrated improvements in synaptic transmission, mitochondrial function, and hearing thresholds, strongly suggesting that restoring NAD⁺ levels could alleviate age-related cochlear degeneration (okur2023long‐termnad+supplementation pages 9-10, ege2024theroleof pages 14-16). Therefore, utilizing an ATP-based assay in hair cell–like organoids provides a direct measure of the metabolic competence that is severely compromised in ARHL.

Previous Use:
Metabolic assays in cochlear organoids have been instrumental in elucidating the metabolic barriers to hair cell reprogramming. Prior studies have used similar platforms to demonstrate that specific metabolites, notably α-ketoglutarate and NAD⁺, are limiting factors in hair cell differentiation (liu2024metabolicprofilingof pages 2-3, pages 7-9). Although direct use of ATP-based luminescence assays specifically in high-throughput drug screening for ARHL is not exhaustively documented in the literature provided, related studies have successfully employed ATP measurements as a readout to reflect mitochondrial health and energy metabolism in cochlear cells (desa2019aminoglycosidesrapidlyinhibit pages 1-3). Clinical trial searches have also highlighted active exploration of metabolic support strategies in hearing loss, suggesting that integrating metabolic assays with organoid platforms is a promising avenue for drug discovery (Clinical Trials Search: metabolic support hearing loss).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of this assay include its rapid and quantitative nature, which enables a direct assessment of cellular energy status following pharmacological intervention. The use of ATP as a readout is well-established and sensitive to changes in mitochondrial activity, and targeting NAD⁺ metabolism is strongly supported by both biomedical and clinical evidence as pivotal in ARHL pathogenesis (ege2024theroleof pages 13-16). Additionally, hair cell–like organoids offer a controlled in vitro setting that reflects the metabolic dynamics of cochlear cells, facilitating the screening of candidate drugs with potential translational value.
However, weaknesses exist. While ATP levels provide an important marker of metabolic competence, they might not capture all aspects of the bioenergetic and redox state that are equally important for hair cell function. Certain interventions, such as creatine supplementation, have shown only mild effects on hair cell differentiation despite increasing ATP levels, implying that ATP may not be the sole limiting factor (liu2024metabolicprofilingof pages 1-2). Furthermore, this assay may need to be complemented with additional readouts—such as NAD⁺/NADH ratios, mitochondrial ROS production, or expression of key metabolic enzymes—to fully characterize the multifaceted metabolic alterations in ARHL.
Overall, the proposed assay represents a feasible and informative tool in early-stage drug discovery for ARHL, provided its limitations are addressed by integrating complementary metabolic assessments (liu2024metabolicprofilingof pages 1-2, okur2023long‐termnad+supplementation pages 10-11).
