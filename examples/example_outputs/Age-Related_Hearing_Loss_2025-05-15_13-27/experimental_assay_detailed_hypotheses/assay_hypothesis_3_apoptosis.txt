Assay Overview:
The proposed strategy employs a caspase‐3/7 luminescent reporter in primary organ of Corti explants or co‐culture systems to measure early apoptotic activation. This assay models a critical aspect of Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) pathogenesis—namely, the apoptotic loss of auditory hair cells triggered by oxidative stress and cytokine-mediated signaling. In practice, the assay involves challenging explanted cochlear tissues with reactive oxygen species (ROS) or pro-inflammatory cytokines to induce apoptosis. The caspase-3/7 luminescent reporter provides a quantitative readout of caspase activation, which is measured by luminescence intensity via plate-reader detection. Organ of Corti explants are used given their capacity to maintain native tissue architecture and cell interactions, which are crucial for faithfully replicating in vivo apoptotic signaling cascades (abihachem2010theinjuredcochlea pages 1-2, beeck2011apoptosisinacquired pages 1-2).

Biomedical Evidence:
The biomedical literature robustly supports the centrality of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of ARHL. Multiple studies have demonstrated that apoptosis, especially as orchestrated by caspase cascades (including caspase-3 and caspase-7), plays a pivotal role in cochlear hair cell degeneration (abihachem2010theinjuredcochlea pages 6-6, beeck2011apoptosisinacquired pages 5-7). Both oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α have been implicated in initiating apoptotic cascades in the cochlea by activating the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. This underpins the rationale for an assay targeting caspase activity as a direct measure of apoptosis. The fact that similar apoptotic markers and caspase activations have been validated in clinical and preclinical studies of ARHL (frisina2016agerelatedhearingloss pages 8-9, beeck2011apoptosisinacquired pages 4-5) further strengthens the argument that measuring inhibition of these pathways can serve as a surrogate for the therapeutic efficacy of candidate drugs.

Previous Use:
The use of caspase activity assays in conjunction with organ of Corti explants is well documented. Ex vivo systems have shown that caspase inhibitors can significantly reduce hair cell loss induced by various stressors such as acoustic trauma and ototoxic agents (abihachem2010theinjuredcochlea pages 6-8, beeck2011apoptosisinacquired pages 7-8). Furthermore, the caspase-3/7 luminescent apoptosis inhibition assay has been applied in studies evaluating protective compounds that target apoptosis in cochlear tissues, thereby confirming its utility in early-stage drug discovery pipelines (eshraghi2013molecularmechanismsinvolved pages 9-11). These prior applications have led to important insights regarding the modulation of apoptotic pathways and have validated experimental approaches designed to screen otoprotective agents.

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of this assay include its high sensitivity and rapid quantification of apoptosis through direct measurement of caspase-3/7 activity. The use of organ of Corti explants provides a relevant physiological context that preserves critical cell–cell interactions and native tissue architecture, thereby ensuring that results are translatable to in vivo systems. Additionally, the assay directly targets a well-established molecular mechanism involved in ARHL, aligning closely with both biomedical and clinical evidence indicating that apoptosis is a driving force in cochlear degeneration (beeck2011apoptosisinacquired pages 2-4, frisina2016agerelatedhearingloss pages 9-11).

However, some weaknesses need careful consideration. ARHL is multifactorial, and while caspase-3/7 activity is a central marker of apoptosis, it does not capture all cell death modalities or the full spectrum of the complex apoptotic network. For instance, non-caspase-dependent pathways and delayed apoptotic events may not be fully assessed using this approach. Moreover, the transient nature of caspase activation may require precise timing and robust controls to ensure reproducibility and interpretability of results.

Overall, the caspase-3/7 luminescent apoptosis inhibition assay in organ of Corti explants represents a scientifically sound and practical tool to evaluate anti-apoptotic candidate drugs for ARHL, provided its limitations are acknowledged and addressed through complementary assays and longitudinal studies (abihachem2010theinjuredcochlea pages 11-13, frisina2016agerelatedhearingloss pages 9-11).
