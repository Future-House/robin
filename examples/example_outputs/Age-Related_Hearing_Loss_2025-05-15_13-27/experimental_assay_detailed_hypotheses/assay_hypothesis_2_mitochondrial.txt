Assay Overview:
The proposed assay evaluates the ability of candidate therapeutics to preserve or restore mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in stem-cell–derived inner ear organoids. This model recapitulates critical aspects of Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) pathogenesis by mimicking cochlear cell types that are susceptible to mitochondrial dysfunction. In this assay, fluorescent dyes such as JC‑1 or TMRM are used to quantify MMP: JC‑1 dye accumulates in healthy mitochondria, forming red-fluorescent aggregates that shift to green fluorescence upon depolarization, whereas TMRM provides sensitive, direct measurement of potential changes. Readouts include the ratio of red to green fluorescence (in the case of JC‑1) or absolute fluorescence intensity (with TMRM) measured through fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. The assay utilizes inner ear organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells that express key cochlear markers, thereby providing a physiologically relevant platform to model the mitochondrial pathogenesis underlying ARHL (xue2016mir29boverexpressioninduces pages 2-3, tan2017novelroleof pages 1-2).

Biomedical Evidence:
Mitochondrial dysfunction is central to ARHL pathogenesis. Alterations in MMP are directly tied to reduced ATP synthesis, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and subsequent activation of cell death pathways. The literature highlights that oxidative stress coupled with impaired mitochondrial dynamics leads to hair cell apoptosis and cochlear degeneration (ege2024theroleof pages 3-6, li2023mitochondrialdysfunctionin pages 2-4). Moreover, clinical and preclinical observations indicate that parameters such as decreased mitochondrial respiratory capacity and altered MMP correlate with progressive auditory deficits (wang2020presbycusisanupdate pages 8-10, tan2017novelroleof pages 1-2). Therapeutic strategies aimed at rescuing mitochondrial function, as assessed by these parameters, have shown promise in restoring cellular viability and preventing hearing decline (bazard2021cochlearinflammagingin pages 9-11, lin2019inhibitionofdrp1dependent pages 1-2).

Previous Use:
MMP assays using JC‑1 or TMRM have been widely implemented in studies employing auditory cell lines such as HEI‑OC1 to quantify mitochondrial dysfunction in response to oxidative stress or genetic manipulations. For example, these assays have successfully demonstrated that modulation of proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics (e.g., DRP-1) correlates with changes in MMP, providing insights on mitophagy and cellular survival (kim2021bcl2interactingprotein pages 1-7, lin2019inhibitionofdrp1dependent pages 1-2). Additionally, research with mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants, such as mito‑TEMPO, has utilized these assays to evaluate restoration of MMP as a marker for therapeutic efficacy against cochlear oxidative damage (chen2022mitotempoattenuatesoxidative pages 1-2, tan2017novelroleof pages 1-2). These precedents underpin the utility of MMP assays in screening candidate drugs for mitochondrial rescue in ARHL models (lyu2020mitochondrialdamageand pages 12-14, okur2022approachestomitigate pages 1-3).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths:
• The assay provides a direct, quantitative readout of mitochondrial health by measuring MMP—a key determinant of ATP production and cellular viability in cochlear cells (wang2020presbycusisanupdate pages 10-12, ege2024theroleof pages 3-6).
• Using stem-cell–derived inner ear organoids improves physiological relevance, enabling assessment of drug effects in a three-dimensional, multicellular environment that mimics in vivo cochlear architecture (xue2016mir29boverexpressioninduces pages 2-3).
• The established use of JC‑1/TMRM in auditory cell research supports their sensitivity and reliability in detecting mitochondrial rescue events (kim2021bcl2interactingprotein pages 26-31).

Weaknesses:
• The assay exclusively focuses on mitochondrial function and may overlook other critical ARHL aspects such as inflammatory processes, synaptic degeneration, and broader apoptotic pathways (kim2021bcl2interactingprotein pages 17-21, lyu2020mitochondrialdamageand pages 6-10).
• Stem-cell–derived organoids require rigorous characterization to ensure that their mitochondrial dynamics faithfully represent those in the native cochlea. Complementary assays (e.g., ATP quantification, ROS measurements) may be needed to build a complete picture of cellular health (wang2020presbycusisanupdate pages 8-10).

In summary, the mitochondrial membrane potential assay using JC‑1 or TMRM in inner ear organoids is a compelling tool for early-stage drug discovery in ARHL. It directly addresses mitochondrial-related pathogenesis by providing a functional readout that correlates with key bioenergetic and apoptotic parameters implicated in hearing loss, making it a suitable assay for screening and validating mitochondrial rescue compounds (bazard2021cochlearinflammagingin pages 9-11, li2023mitochondrialdysfunctionin pages 2-4).
