Assay Overview:
This assay proposes the use of high‐content imaging of CtBP2‐positive synaptic ribbons in organ of Corti explants as a proxy for assessing the connectivity between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons. The approach involves isolating organ of Corti explants from murine cochleae, immunostaining with anti‐CtBP2 antibodies to label ribbon synapses, and automated confocal microscopy for imaging across cochlear regions corresponding to different auditory frequencies. Quantitative analysis is then performed by counting CtBP2‐positive puncta per IHC, which serves as a measure of synaptic integrity. This assay thereby models a critical aspect of the pathogenesis of age‐related hearing loss (ARHL)—namely, cochlear synaptopathy, where degradation or loss of synaptic ribbons leads to impaired neurotransmission and subsequent auditory dysfunction (gong2020lossofcochlear pages 2-4, jeng2020pathophysiologicalchangesin pages 6-9).

Biomedical Evidence:
The degeneration of CtBP2‐positive synaptic ribbons in IHCs has been correlated with early stages of ARHL, as loss of these presynaptic structures precedes overt hair cell or neuronal loss. Synaptic ribbons are essential for ensuring the rapid and sustained neurotransmitter release necessary for auditory signal fidelity; their loss leads to diminished auditory brainstem response amplitudes and challenges in signal processing, particularly in noisy environments (gong2020lossofcochleara pages 1-2, peineau2021synapticreleasepotentiation pages 1-2). Moreover, biomedical and clinical literature supports that early synaptopathy establishes a molecular basis for progressive hearing impairment, rendering CtBP2 ribbon quantification a biologically relevant readout for therapeutic interventions aimed at synaptic preservation or regeneration (saidia2024oxidativestressplays pages 2-4, Clinical Trials Search: synaptic maintenance OR ribbon synapse OR CtBP2 hearing loss OR cochlear synaptopathy).

Previous Use:
Several studies have successfully applied similar methodologies to evaluate synaptic integrity in murine models of ARHL as well as noise-induced and excitotoxic damage. For example, research has demonstrated that quantification of CtBP2‐positive synaptic ribbons by immunostaining combined with high-resolution confocal imaging detects early synaptic declines in aging cochleae, which correlate with functional deficits measured via ABR recordings (gong2020lossofcochlear pages 1-2, jeng2020pathophysiologicalchangesin pages 38-38). Additionally, organ of Corti explants have been used in preclinical investigations to assess the efficacy of neurotrophins and other agents in restoring synaptic connectivity, supporting the utility of this assay in early drug screening (szobota2019bdnfnt3and pages 14-15, mohamad2024synapticribbondynamics pages 5-6).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of this assay include its high specificity and sensitivity to synaptic integrity, enabling precise quantification of CtBP2-positive ribbons as a morphological surrogate for functional connectivity between hair cells and auditory neurons. The use of automated high-content imaging facilitates throughput and reproducibility, which is critical in early-stage drug screening. Furthermore, the ability to detect subtle synaptic changes before gross structural loss allows for early intervention in the disease process (gong2020lossofcochleara pages 2-4, jeng2020pathophysiologicalchangesin pages 6-9).

However, limitations exist. The ex vivo nature of organ of Corti explant preparations may not fully capture the complexity of in vivo cochlear environments, including systemic influences and long-term drug pharmacodynamics. Technical variability in immunostaining, tissue viability, and image analysis can also pose challenges and may necessitate rigorous standardization and complementary functional assays—such as electrophysiological measurements—to establish a comprehensive drug efficacy profile (nolan2022targeteddeletionof pages 11-12, saidia2024oxidativestressplays pages 2-4). Despite these challenges, evidence from the biomedical and clinical literature strongly supports the translational relevance of this assay for ARHL drug discovery, particularly when used in an integrated screening and validation pipeline.

In summary, high‐content imaging for quantification of CtBP2‐positive synaptic ribbons in organ of Corti explants is a biologically and technically robust platform for early-stage evaluation of therapeutics targeting synaptic maintenance in age‐related hearing loss (gong2020lossofcochlear pages 2-4, jeng2020pathophysiologicalchangesin pages 38-38).
