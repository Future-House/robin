Assay Overview:
The proposed assay evaluates the preservation of cochlear hair cell function by monitoring the uptake of FM1-43, a fluorescent styryl dye known to enter hair cells through active mechanotransducer (MET) channels. In this assay, FM1-43 dye uptake is quantified via fluorescence microscopy following drug treatment, thereby providing a direct readout of MET channel integrity. The assay models a central aspect of age‐related hearing loss (ARHL) pathogenesis, namely, the loss of mechanotransduction that precedes hair cell degeneration. The biological material used includes cochlear explants or otic organoids—derived either from neonatal mouse cochlear tissues or human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)–derived organoids—that contain functional inner and outer hair cells responsible for auditory transduction (derudas2023chargeandlipophilicity pages 1-3, shah2024moderninvitro pages 1-2).

Biomedical Evidence:
A key pathological mechanism in ARHL is the progressive decline in hair cell function resulting from impaired mechanotransduction. The MET channels in hair cells are essential for converting mechanical sound vibrations into electrical signals, and their dysfunction forms a critical nexus in ARHL pathogenesis. Studies indicate that the uptake of FM1-43 directly correlates with the operational status of these channels, making it a reliable surrogate marker for mechanotransduction preservation. This is supported by biomedical literature highlighting that alterations in hair cell MET function are early indicators of hearing impairment driven by aging, and are implicated in the vulnerability of hair cells to stressors such as ototoxic drugs (mahieu2020modellingthepermeation pages 30-34, derudas2023chargeandlipophilicity pages 17-17). Clinically, while genetic studies and audiometric assessments provide macro-level insights into ARHL, the FM1-43 assay serves to model the cellular dysfunction underpinning the clinical phenotype, thereby bridging the gap between molecular pathology and functional hearing loss (schubert2022transcriptomeguidedidentificationof pages 1-2).

Previous Use:
FM1-43 dye uptake assays have been extensively utilized in preclinical studies investigating hair cell function. Prior work has demonstrated that FM1-43 enters hair cells through functional MET channels, and changes in its uptake have been used to evaluate the efficacy of otoprotective compounds in models of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss. For instance, studies using zebrafish neuromasts and mouse cochlear explants have shown that compounds capable of protecting hair cells can preserve FM1-43 uptake while preventing ototoxic damage (zallocchi2021characterizationofquinoxaline pages 13-14, mahalieu2020modellingthepermeation pages 34-37). These findings underscore that the assay is sensitive not only to outright cell death but also to subtle functional impairments in mechanotransduction, a quality that renders it invaluable in early-stage drug screening pipelines for ARHL.

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of the FM1-43 dye uptake assay include its rapid and direct measurement of a critical functional endpoint—MET channel activity—using live cells. The assay’s quantitative nature enables the detection of subtle changes in hair cell mechanotransduction that may occur before overt cell death or structural damage, which is essential for screening compounds aimed at preserving early hair cell function. Its compatibility with cochlear explants and organoids provides a platform that is both biologically relevant and scalable for high-throughput drug discovery (derudas2023chargeandlipophilicity pages 1-3, zallocchi2021characterizationofquinoxaline pages 13-14).

However, there are notable limitations. FM1-43 dye uptake is an indirect measure of MET channel function and does not provide detailed insight into the molecular composition or kinetic properties of the channels. Moreover, the assay might not capture other aspects of ARHL pathology such as synaptic degeneration, oxidative stress, or inflammatory processes that also contribute to hearing loss. Potential dye toxicity at high concentrations and variability in dye uptake due to experimental conditions are additional challenges that need to be addressed in assay optimization. Finally, while in vitro models (explant and organoid cultures) deliver vital mechanistic insights, their ability to fully recapitulate the complex and chronic progression of ARHL in vivo remains limited (mahieu2020modellingthepermeation pages 30-34, shah2024moderninvitro pages 1-2).

In conclusion, the FM1-43 dye uptake assay is a valuable tool for early-stage drug screening targeting mechanotransduction preservation in ARHL. Its strengths in sensitivity, rapid readout, and direct functional relevance make it an appealing method for initial evaluations of candidate compounds. Nonetheless, its limitations mandate that results be interpreted alongside complementary assays and in vivo studies to develop a comprehensive therapeutic strategy for ARHL (derudas2023chargeandlipophilicity pages 17-17, zallocchi2021characterizationofquinoxaline pages 13-14).
