Assay Overview:
The proposed assay employs high-content phenotypic screening using automated immunofluorescence to quantify Myo7a and Sox2 expression in 96-well plates of iPSC‐derived inner ear organoids. Myo7a serves as a marker for sensory hair cells, while Sox2 marks supporting cells and progenitors. The assay monitors cellular morphology, differentiation status, and potentially cell viability changes after drug exposure, capturing multiple endpoints from a single well via multiplexed image analysis. This platform is designed to recapitulate critical aspects of inner ear cellular architecture and phenotype, providing a human-specific in vitro model for evaluating candidate therapeutics for Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL) (pasdelou2024ototoxicityahigh pages 7-8, roccio2021directeddifferentiationand pages 8-9).

Biomedical Evidence:
Age-Related Hearing Loss is primarily associated with a progressive loss or dysfunction of cochlear hair cells and their supporting cellular environments. The selection of Myo7a as a hair cell marker and Sox2 as a marker for supporting cells and progenitors is particularly relevant, as these proteins are fundamentally involved in the development and maintenance of inner ear structures. Human iPSC-derived organoids, although often displaying immature or fetal-like phenotypes, provide a compelling in vitro representation of inner ear biology, allowing exploration of cellular responses that may mirror early degenerative events in ARHL (pianigiani2024innerearorganoids pages 1-3, roccio2019innerearorganoids pages 7-8). Furthermore, the ongoing clinical research into organoid and cell-based assays underscores the alignment of this strategy with emerging therapeutic paradigms and the translational need for human-relevant models (Clinical Trials Search: organoid assay hearing loss OR cell-based assay hearing loss OR cell therapy hearing loss).

Previous Use:
The use of automated immunofluorescence targeting Myo7a and Sox2 in organoid systems has been demonstrated in previous studies to accurately quantify hair cell populations and assess changes in phenotype after drug treatment. This approach has enabled the screening of compounds for ototoxicity as well as regenerative capacity in vitro. Specifically, iPSC-derived organoids have been used to model genetic hearing loss, evaluate gene editing, and test drug-induced effects on sensory cell maturation (zine2021ahumaninduced pages 4-5, roccio2021directeddifferentiationand pages 2-4). Although these assays are still evolving – especially around standardization and reproducibility – the literature supports their utility in capturing multiple cellular endpoints, which are critical for drug discovery efforts in hearing loss (roccio2021directeddifferentiationand pages 8-9).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of this assay include its ability to capture multiplexed readouts from a biologically complex, hiPSC-derived organoid platform in a scalable 96-well format. The automated image analysis of Myo7a and Sox2 expression enables quantitative comparison of drug effects on sensory cell survival, differentiation, and morphology, which are central to ARHL pathogenesis. The human origin of the cells increases translational relevance compared to animal models and supports personalized medicine applications. On the other hand, limitations include variability in organoid differentiation efficiency, incomplete maturation of hair cells relative to the adult inner ear, and challenges in reproducing complex three-dimensional architecture consistently. Additionally, the immature state of the organoids may limit their ability to fully mimic the chronic degenerative changes seen in ARHL, and issues related to light scattering during imaging can affect quantitative readouts (pianigiani2024innerearorganoids pages 3-6, roccio2019innerearorganoids pages 7-8). Despite these challenges, with further refinement in differentiation protocols and rigorous standardization efforts, this high-content screening assay represents a promising platform for early-stage drug discovery aimed at treating Age-Related Hearing Loss (roccio2021directeddifferentiationand pages 8-9, pasdelou2024ototoxicityahigh pages 7-8).
