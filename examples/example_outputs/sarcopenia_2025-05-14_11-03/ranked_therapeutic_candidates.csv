Tirasemtiv,"Proposal for Tirasemtiv

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tirasemtiv is a small‐molecule drug discovered through high‐throughput screening and subsequent chemical optimization efforts aimed at identifying compounds with high potency and favorable metabolic stability. It belongs to a class of therapeutic agents known as fast skeletal muscle troponin activators (FSTA). These compounds are designed to bind selectively to the fast skeletal troponin complex, primarily troponin C (sTnC), and to increase muscle fiber sensitivity to calcium ions (Ca²⁺) during the excitation–contraction process. The discovery and chemical characterization of tirasemtiv are well documented; structure–activity relationship studies identified key substituents, such as the optimum 3‐pentyl group and an ethynyl modification that conferred high potency and favorable pharmacokinetic attributes (Collibee et al., 2018). Historically, compounds of this class have been developed to target muscle weakness in neuromuscular diseases by acting directly on the contractile apparatus rather than on upstream neurological inputs. Owing to its oral bioavailability and established ADME characteristics, tirasemtiv is an attractive candidate for repurposing for other forms of muscle dysfunction, such as sarcopenia, even though its initial development was directed at diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015).

Therapeutic History:
Tirasemtiv’s primary history of development has been in the context of ALS, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency due to motor neuron loss. Several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate its efficacy and safety in ALS patients. Notably, Phase II and Phase III trials—such as those registered under ClinicalTrials.gov (2010–2012)—have generated extensive pharmacodynamic data demonstrating that tirasemtiv increases submaximal isometric muscle force, enhances endurance, and slows the decline in respiratory function, as measured by slow vital capacity (SVC) and other endpoints (Shefner et al., 2012; Hansen et al., 2014). Although its performance in large-scale ALS clinical endpoints has been mixed—with some trials not meeting all primary endpoints—there is clear proof-of-concept evidence that the drug modulates neuromuscular Ca²⁺ sensitivity and improves skeletal muscle performance (Alsulami & Marston, 2020). Importantly, no dedicated clinical trials for sarcopenia have been conducted, but the extensive history of clinical investigation in ALS, along with preclinical studies in animal models (e.g., the B6SJL-SOD1G93A mouse model), provides solid translational validation for its effects on skeletal muscle (Collibee et al., 2018; Hwee et al., 2014). The repurposing rationale for sarcopenia emerges from the recognition that both ALS and sarcopenia share a final common pathway of impaired skeletal muscle contractility and increased fatigability, even though the etiologies differ (ClinicalTrials.gov, search).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, tirasemtiv functions by selectively binding to the fast skeletal troponin C isoform. The binding event increases the sensitivity of troponin C to Ca²⁺, a critical element for actomyosin interaction during muscle contraction. Detailed structural studies using solution NMR and other biophysical techniques have shown that tirasemtiv fits into a hydrophobic pocket formed between troponin C and the switch region of troponin I (sTnI), thereby stabilizing the Ca²⁺-bound active conformation of the troponin complex (Li et al., 2021). This stabilization translates into a leftward shift in the calcium–force relationship (pCa shift), meaning lower concentrations of Ca²⁺ are required to trigger contractile force generation. Preclinical experiments have demonstrated that this increase in Ca²⁺ sensitivity amplifies submaximal isometric force production without elevating maximum force at full Ca²⁺ saturation (Hansen et al., 2014). This effect is of particular importance because most daily muscle activities operate at submaximal levels of stimulation, which are compromised in conditions like sarcopenia. The compound’s well-characterized pharmacodynamic profile establishes that by enhancing Ca²⁺ sensitivity via a direct molecular interaction with fast skeletal troponin C, tirasemtiv prolongs the force‐generating state of the actomyosin complex during nerve-evoked contractions (Hwang & Sykes, 2015). Moreover, the effect of tirasemtiv on muscle fibers has been confirmed in both in vitro and in vivo models, where increases in muscle endurance, grip strength, and respiratory muscle force (diaphragm function) have been recorded (Hwee et al., 2014; Collibee et al., 2018).

Expected Effect:
Based on tirasemtiv’s mechanism of action, the expected effect in sarcopenic muscle would be the restoration of twitch force and the reduction of muscle fatigue. In aged myotubes, where Ca²⁺ transient deficits and decreased contractile efficiency contribute to sarcopenia, tirasemtiv would selectively bind to fast skeletal troponin C and increase its Ca²⁺ affinity. This leads to an enhanced force‐generating response during neuromuscular stimulation. Preclinical studies in ALS models have shown that treatment with tirasemtiv results in measurable improvements in parameters such as submaximal isometric force, grip strength, rotarod performance, and respiratory function, all of which are proxies for increased muscle endurance and contractility (Hansen et al., 2014; Hwee et al., 2014). In the context of sarcopenia, a condition characterized by age-associated decline in muscle mass and function, similar improvements would be anticipated. Fast‐twitch fibers, which are more susceptible to sarcopenic atrophy, would benefit from the prolonged force‐generating state induced by tirasemtiv, thereby potentially restoring some degree of strength and reducing fatigue during repetitive submaximal contractions. This hypothesis is supported by the translational evidence from ALS trials, where a slowing of the decline in respiratory and limb muscle function was observed even in the presence of a compromised neuromuscular input (Shefner et al., 2021; Alsulami & Marston, 2020). In aged muscle, where fast skeletal troponin C is expressed in approximately 50–60% of the contractile proteins in the vulnerable fibers, the selective action of tirasemtiv could yield a significant functional benefit (ClinicalTrials.gov, search).

Overall Evaluation:
Tirasemtiv emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of sarcopenia based on its robust preclinical proof‐of‐concept and well-characterized mechanism of action. One of its primary strengths is the direct modulation of the muscle contractile apparatus by enhancing Ca²⁺ sensitivity via fast skeletal troponin C activation. This represents an orthogonal strategy compared to interventions that target sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ handling proteins such as SERCA or RyR. The oral bioavailability, established ADME profile, and extensive safety and tolerability data obtained from multiple ALS trials further underscore its potential for repurposing (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Collibee et al., 2018). In preclinical animal models, tirasemtiv has consistently demonstrated the capacity to increase submaximal muscle force, reduce fatigability, and improve overall muscle performance metrics such as grip strength and respiratory function (Hwee et al., 2014; Hansen et al., 2014). Translational studies in ALS patients have provided additional evidence that the drug’s mechanism can produce clinically meaningful improvements in muscle function—even if the broader disease-modifying outcomes in ALS were limited (Shefner et al., 2012; Rudnicki et al., 2021).

Nevertheless, there are notable weaknesses and challenges to consider. First, while extensive trials in ALS provide a strong pharmacodynamic rationale, sarcopenia has a fundamentally different pathophysiology from neurodegenerative muscle weakness. Sarcopenia is primarily an age-associated decline in muscle mass, quality, and function that may involve alterations in anabolic signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic low-level inflammation, and neuromuscular junction regression. Therefore, while tirasemtiv’s mechanism of enhancing muscle contractility is mechanistically plausible, direct evidence in aged populations or models of sarcopenia is lacking (Scaricamazza et al., 2021; Tarantino et al., 2022). Second, clinical trials in ALS have revealed tolerability issues (e.g., dizziness, gastrointestinal side effects, weight loss) that, although manageable in a more severely affected population, could limit long‐term use in elderly patients with sarcopenia who may have multiple comorbid conditions (Shefner et al., 2016). Third, although the modulation of fast skeletal troponin C offers a targeted and attractive approach, the robustness of the functional improvement in a sarcopenic state is yet to be confirmed in dedicated clinical studies. Finally, the possibility that the drug might not sufficiently address other facets of age‐related muscle degeneration that extend beyond impaired Ca²⁺ sensitivity—for example, reduced muscle regenerative capacity or insulin resistance—merits further investigation (Alsulami & Marston, 2020; Maragakis et al., 2023).

In summary, tirasemtiv demonstrates a solid mechanistic basis and favorable pharmacological profile that support its repurposing as a treatment for sarcopenia. It works by selectively binding to fast skeletal troponin C, thereby increasing Ca²⁺ sensitivity and prolonging the force‐generating state of the actomyosin complex, which should, in theory, restore twitch force and reduce fatigue in aged, sarcopenic muscle (Li et al., 2021; Hwang & Sykes, 2015). The preclinical validation in animal models of neuromuscular disease and the translational clinical data in ALS patients provide an encouraging rational basis for exploring its efficacy in restoring muscle function in the elderly. However, the transition from neurodegenerative muscle weakness to age‐related sarcopenia remains an area requiring cautious evaluation. Dedicated preclinical studies using aged animal models and subsequent phase II clinical trials in sarcopenic populations would be necessary to establish its efficacy, dosage, and safety profile in this new indication. The overall strengths of repurposing tirasemtiv lie in its oral administration, well‐documented ADME and tolerability profile, and verified mechanism of directly modulating muscle force generation. Its weaknesses, however, include the potential for untoward side effects in a frail population and the need for further evidence demonstrating that enhanced Ca²⁺ sensitivity alone can overcome the multifactorial nature of sarcopenia. Based on the comprehensive literature review, tirasemtiv is a promising candidate with a strong scientific rationale for treating sarcopenia, provided that upcoming targeted studies confirm its functional benefits in aged muscle and establish an acceptable risk–benefit ratio for elderly patients (Collibee et al., 2018; Shefner et al., 2021; Tarantino et al., 2022).

CK-2127107 (Reldesemtiv),"Proposal for CK-2127107 (Reldesemtiv)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
CK-2127107, also known as Reldesemtiv, is a fully synthetic, small‐molecule fast skeletal troponin activator (FSTA) originally discovered through a drug discovery program aiming to directly target the contractile apparatus of skeletal muscle (Alsulami & Marston, 2020). It belongs to a novel class of compounds that sensitize the fast skeletal troponin complex to calcium, thereby enhancing muscle contractility without altering global calcium homeostasis. Reldesemtiv was designed as a next‐generation agent following earlier compounds such as tirasemtiv. The initial synthesis involved optimizing chemical scaffolds to achieve high potency, selectivity, and improved pharmacokinetic profiles relative to earlier analogues. The chemical structure of this compound is based on modifications of heteroaryl‐containing pyrimidine derivatives that interact selectively with fast skeletal muscle troponin C (Alsulami & Marston, 2020; Andrews et al., 2018). This structural design enables Reldesemtiv to bind selectively to the regulatory complex in fast fibers, thus sparing slow skeletal and cardiac muscle isoforms and reducing the potential for off‐target cardiac effects. In essence, Reldesemtiv is part of a family of muscle activators that have historically been developed for neuromuscular diseases, and its proposed repurposing for sarcopenia leverages its ability to counteract muscle weakness by directly enhancing contractile responsiveness in atrophied or aged muscle fibers (Park, 2018).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of CK-2127107 is anchored in its evaluation for neuromuscular indications. Early pharmacodynamic assessments were conducted in healthy human volunteer studies where Reldesemtiv demonstrated dose‐dependent increases in muscle force production following nerve stimulation (Andrews et al., 2018). Subsequent clinical trials, including Phase 2 studies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017) and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016), provided initial safety and pharmacokinetic data that confirmed oral bioavailability and a favorable tolerability profile (Unknown Reference). Although the majority of clinical development so far has been directed toward neuromuscular disorders such as ALS and SMA—with endpoints measuring respiratory muscle function and global motor performance—the compound has never been directly evaluated in a dedicated trial for sarcopenia. However, the underlying mechanism by which Reldesemtiv enhances muscle contractility makes it an attractive candidate for repurposing to treat age‐related muscle weakness, where the pathology involves diminished contractile output rather than solely reduced muscle mass (Unknown Reference). Its use in these neuromuscular diseases thus provides proof‐of‐concept data regarding the feasibility of targeting the muscle’s contractile machinery, even though the patient populations differ. Preclinical studies in rodent models have similarly demonstrated improved exercise tolerance and enhanced muscle force production with FSTAs, lending further support to their potential translational application in conditions characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness, such as sarcopenia (Cheng et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, CK-2127107 exerts its effects by binding to the fast skeletal muscle troponin complex, with a particular focus on modulating troponin C’s interaction with calcium ions. The compound binds selectively and with high affinity to the fast skeletal isoform of troponin C, thereby stabilizing its calcium‐bound active conformation and effectively slowing the dissociation rate of calcium from the complex (Hwee et al., 2017). This mechanism translates into an increased calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, which enables a given submaximal intracellular calcium concentration to produce a stronger force output. Importantly, this approach bypasses some of the defects associated with impaired excitation–contraction coupling that can occur in sarcopenic muscle, where calcium handling may be suboptimal (Andrews et al., 2018). Reldesemtiv’s binding appears to occur at a site that is unique to fast skeletal muscle troponin—differing from the isoforms present in slow skeletal and cardiac muscle—which further minimizes the risk of off‐target effects that could manifest as adverse cardiac outcomes (Alsulami & Marston, 2020; Cheng et al., 2020). The detailed biochemical interactions involve not only conventional binding forces like hydrogen bonds but may also include pi-alkyl, halogen, and other non-covalent interactions with key residues on troponin C, thus altering the kinetics of calcium binding and release. This increased calcium sensitivity allows the muscle fibers to generate greater contractile force at the typical firing rates of motor neurons seen during everyday activities—particularly in the 5–15 Hz range—making the drug especially useful in conditions where muscles receive suboptimal stimulation (Andrews et al., 2018; Calder et al., 2016).

Expected Effect:
When applied to assays using aged human myotubes or in a clinical setting involving elderly individuals with sarcopenia, the expected effect of CK-2127107 is an enhancement of skeletal muscle contractility resulting in improved submaximal twitch force. In the context of sarcopenia, muscle fibers typically exhibit reduced force production due to a combination of atrophy and impaired excitation–contraction coupling. By increasing the sensitivity of troponin C to calcium, Reldesemtiv is anticipated to partially restore the force-generating capacity of these fibers without necessitating an increase in intracellular calcium levels—which could otherwise provoke deleterious effects such as increased energy expenditure or arrhythmogenicity in non-target tissues (Hwee et al., 2017; Andrews et al., 2018). Furthermore, studies in healthy volunteers have already demonstrated that CK-2127107 produces a dose-dependent increase in muscle force when evaluated by electrical stimulation protocols; this supports the hypothesis that, in sarcopenic muscle, even modest improvements in the contractile apparatus can translate into significant functional gains (Andrews et al., 2018). This mode of action operates independently of pathways that solely target muscle mass, such as anabolic or myostatin-inhibiting therapies, and therefore has the potential to provide a complementary or alternative strategy that directly addresses the decline in muscle quality and contractile performance that characterizes sarcopenia (Cheng et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, CK-2127107 (Reldesemtiv) represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of sarcopenia based on its mechanistic profile, preclinical data, and early-phase clinical safety and pharmacokinetic data. Its strengths include a well-defined molecular mechanism—direct binding to fast skeletal muscle troponin C that enhances calcium sensitivity—which leads to improved force generation while sparing slow skeletal and cardiac muscle. This selectivity is crucial because it minimizes potential off-target effects and ensures that only the muscle fibers most affected in sarcopenia (i.e., fast-twitch fibers) are activated (Alsulami & Marston, 2020; Andrews et al., 2018). Additionally, the compound has undergone thorough Phase I evaluations that have established both its safety and favorable oral pharmacokinetics, thereby providing a sound translational foundation from bench to bedside (Andrews et al., 2018; Unknown Reference).

However, some weaknesses remain. To date, clinical data on Reldesemtiv have been generated primarily in patient populations with neuromuscular diseases such as ALS and in models of COPD; no direct clinical trials have yet been conducted in elderly populations solely suffering from sarcopenia. While the mechanism of action is highly relevant to sarcopenia—where reduced contractility and calcium handling defects are prominent—the efficacy of this FSTA in reversing age-associated muscle weakness remains to be definitively demonstrated (Unknown Reference). Furthermore, the translational leap from improved submaximal force in controlled stimulation experiments to meaningful functional outcomes in older adults is nontrivial; clinical endpoints in sarcopenia would need to include comprehensive assessments of mobility, endurance, and quality of life to establish true benefit (Park, 2018; Correa‐de-Araujo & Bhasin, 2022).

In summary, the cumulative evidence from biochemical assays, preclinical models, and early human studies strongly supports the hypothesis that CK-2127107 can enhance fast skeletal muscle function by modulating troponin C calcium sensitivity. This mechanism is especially appealing in the context of sarcopenia, where conventional therapies aimed at mass gain have had limited success translating into improved muscle performance and physical function. The specificity of CK-2127107 for fast fibers, combined with an established safety record in early clinical studies, positions it as a compelling candidate for further evaluation in sarcopenia. Future studies should aim to verify that the improvements in contractile force observed in preclinical models are replicated in aged human myotubes and elderly subjects, and that these changes ultimately translate into functional benefits such as enhanced mobility and endurance (Andrews et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2020). Addressing these gaps through focused clinical trials in sarcopenic populations would be essential before broadly endorsing CK-2127107 as a treatment for age-related muscle decline. In conclusion, while the preponderance of current evidence is supportive and the mechanistic rationale is sound, the final determination of CK-2127107’s utility for sarcopenia will depend on forthcoming data from studies directly targeting the elderly population afflicted by this condition (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rudnicki et al., 2021; Shefner et al., 2021).

Elamipretide (SS-31),"Proposal for Elamipretide (SS-31)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Elamipretide (also known as SS-31) is a synthetic tetrapeptide developed to target mitochondrial dysfunction. It was discovered based on the concept of mitochondrial-targeted therapeutics that selectively accumulate in mitochondria regardless of membrane potential. Chemically, it is composed of alternating aromatic and cationic residues that facilitate its binding to cardiolipin—a phospholipid exclusive to the inner mitochondrial membrane critical for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function. As a member of the Szeto–Schiller peptide family, elamipretide is designed to restore mitochondrial integrity rather than serving merely as a conventional antioxidant. Compounds in this class have previously been utilized in preclinical studies to protect against ischemia-reperfusion injury, attenuate oxidative stress in cardiac tissue, and improve mitochondrial bioenergetics in animal models of mitochondrial diseases (Pepe, 2019; Roshanravan et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Elamipretide has an extensive developmental history in both biochemical and clinical contexts. Biochemically, its ability to bind cardiolipin and modulate mitochondrial function has been demonstrated in multiple preclinical models, where it improved mitochondrial ATP production and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Clinically, elamipretide has been evaluated in Phase II clinical trials for primary mitochondrial myopathies, and its pharmacokinetic profile and muscle uptake are well established, with clear evidence of improved in vivo mitochondrial ATP production following administration in older adults (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2015; Roshanravan et al., 2021). In addition, its clinical evaluation in conditions such as Barth Syndrome and primary mitochondrial diseases in controlled trial settings (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2017; Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2022) supports its use in muscle-related pathologies. Although elamipretide has not been directly tested in sarcopenia clinical trials, the similarities in pathophysiological mechanisms—particularly mitochondrial dysfunction leading to muscle weakness—provide a strong rationale for repurposing it as a therapeutic candidate for age-related muscle decline (Bellanti et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
Elamipretide exerts its therapeutic effects primarily through direct interactions with cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial membrane. This binding stabilizes cardiolipin, thereby preserving the structural integrity of the mitochondrial cristae and promoting the proper assembly and function of the electron transport chain complexes. With improved organization of the electron transport system, mitochondrial ATP synthesis is enhanced while electron leak—a major source of ROS—is minimized (Pepe, 2019; Roshanravan et al., 2021). Additionally, recent studies have suggested that elamipretide improves mitochondrial ADP sensitivity through interactions with the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), resulting in enhanced uptake of ADP and consequent improvement in ATP production in aged muscle tissues (Pharaoh et al., 2023). Beyond its bioenergetic effects, elamipretide’s stabilization of cardiolipin is postulated to preserve mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) and Ca²⁺ exchange sites, which are crucial for maintaining proper mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake and cytosolic Ca²⁺ homeostasis. This preservation of Ca²⁺ exchange platforms may mitigate the excessive cytosolic Ca²⁺ overload seen with aging and thus improve Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and kinetics, ultimately contributing to better fatigue resistance in muscle cells (Roshanravan et al., 2021; Sakellariou et al., 2016). The molecular interactions of elamipretide at the mitochondrial inner membrane are supported by its rapid effect on mitochondrial function observed within hours of administration, indicating that the mechanism is mediated by modulating post-translational processes rather than long-term biosynthetic changes (Roshanravan et al., 2021; Thoma et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the context of sarcopenia, where mitochondrial dysfunction and Ca²⁺ dysregulation contribute significantly to muscle weakness and atrophy, elamipretide is expected to yield several beneficial cellular and physiological effects. The primary anticipated result in the proposed assay is an enhancement in mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, which aids in maintaining optimal mitochondrial metabolic function and supports ATP production. Preservation of MAM contacts and reduced cytosolic Ca²⁺ overload should translate to improved Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and kinetics in aged myotubes, enabling more efficient contraction and improved fatigue resistance (Campbell et al., 2022; Roshanravan et al., 2021). Moreover, since mitochondrial dysfunction is closely linked to reduced muscle bioenergetics and increased oxidative stress, the restoration of mitochondrial membrane integrity by elamipretide is postulated to improve not only Ca²⁺ signaling but also overall muscle endurance and recovery from fatigue (Pepe, 2019; Pharaoh et al., 2023). Most importantly, preclinical data indicate that elamipretide can reverse mitochondrial impairments in aged muscle, which supports the hypothesis that it will have a similar functional impact in assays involving aged myotubes and potentially in clinical models of sarcopenia (Roshanravan et al., 2021; Bellanti et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Elamipretide presents as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of sarcopenia based on its well-characterized mechanism of action, robust preclinical efficacy in improving mitochondrial function, and favorable clinical safety profile in mitochondrial myopathies. One of the key strengths of elamipretide is its targeted mechanism: by binding to cardiolipin and stabilizing mitochondrial membranes, the peptide not only improves ATP production but also reduces ROS formation and preserves critical Ca²⁺ handling structures within mitochondria. This dual action addresses two central contributors to sarcopenia—mitochondrial dysfunction and Ca²⁺ dysregulation—thereby offering a mechanistically sound approach to mitigating muscle degeneration in the elderly (Pepe, 2019; Pharaoh et al., 2023). Additionally, the translational evidence from Phase II clinical trials in primary mitochondrial myopathies and preclinical studies in aged animal models provides strong precedent for its potential repurposing for sarcopenia (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2015; Roshanravan et al., 2021).

However, there are several considerations to note. One potential weakness is the current lack of direct clinical data evaluating the efficacy of elamipretide in sarcopenia specifically; while its mechanism is highly relevant, sarcopenia is a multifactorial disease where additional processes such as inflammation, hormonal changes, and neuromuscular junction degeneration may also play critical roles (Bellanti et al., 2022; Sakellariou et al., 2016). Furthermore, while preclinical models have demonstrated improvements in mitochondrial functions and endurance parameters, translating these benefits into a robust improvement in muscle mass or strength in elderly patients remains an open question. It will be critical to design clinical trials that not only assess biochemical endpoints (such as mitochondrial ATPmax and Ca²⁺ transients) but also include functional outcome measures including muscle strength, endurance, and quality-of-life assessments (Campbell et al., 2023; Roshanravan et al., 2021).

In summary, elamipretide’s capacity to preserve mitochondrial membrane integrity, reduce oxidative stress, and enhance mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake makes it a strong candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic for sarcopenia. Its ability to target mitochondria directly and improve key aspects of cellular bioenergetics addresses core defects associated with sarcopenia. Nonetheless, further investigation is warranted to fully evaluate its clinical efficacy in the context of age-related muscle decline, especially through comprehensive trials designed to capture both molecular improvements and functional muscle outcomes in the elderly population (Pharaoh et al., 2023; Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2017). Overall, while challenges remain, the mechanistic rationale, supportive preclinical evidence, and established clinical safety suggest that elamipretide is a promising therapeutic candidate that merits further exploration in the context of sarcopenia (Unknown Reference; Karaa et al., 2024).

ARM210 (S48168),"Proposal for ARM210 (S48168)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
ARM210, also known as S48168, is a small‐molecule compound of the benzothiazepine chemical class that functions as a Rycal. Rycals have been strategically developed to target ryanodine receptor (RyR) dysfunction by reconstituting the stabilizing interaction between FKBP12 (calstabin1) and RyR1. ARM210 was synthesized as a derivative within the benzothiazepine family, a group of compounds known for their ability to modulate calcium channel behavior by specifically binding to the oxidation‐sensitive domains of RyR1 and thereby restoring the FKBP12–RyR1 interaction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). These compounds have garnered attention due to their ability to stabilize the closed state of RyR channels, reducing pathological sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium (Ca²⁺) leak—a mechanism that underlies muscle weakness in various myopathies. ARM210, as a next‐generation Rycal, has shown in preclinical studies to exhibit oral bioavailability, effective muscle penetration, and favorable pharmacokinetics in rodent models, making it a promising candidate for repurposing for age‐related muscle weakness or sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Armgo Pharma, Inc., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, compounds belonging to the Rycal class have been investigated primarily in the context of cardiac and skeletal muscle disorders. Early preclinical studies focused on using Rycal compounds such as S107 in animal models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and other RYR1‐related myopathies. For example, studies in mdx mice—a well‐established model of DMD—demonstrated that Rycal stabilization of RyR1 improved muscle strength, reduced pathological calcium leak, and enhanced excitation–contraction coupling (Capogrosso et al., 2017, pp. 14–16; Forrester, 2018, pp. 74–84). More recently, ARM210 has been evaluated in clinical studies targeting RYR1‐related myopathies (RYR1‐RM), as exemplified by the phase I trial NCT04141670 in patients with genetically confirmed RYR1 mutations. Although the primary focus of these trials has been on inherited myopathies, the underlying mechanism involving pathological calcium leak due to RyR1 oxidation is also central to the pathogenesis of sarcopenia (Armgo Pharma, Inc., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The therapeutic history of benzothiazepine Rycals extends from cardiac pathologies to muscle diseases; the specificity of ARM210 for RyR1 without significantly affecting RyR2 offers a targeted approach distinct from non‐specific calcium channel blockers. Furthermore, preclinical studies in aged rodents have shown that RyR1‐stabilizing compounds improve evoked Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and fatigue resistance, suggesting that the benefits observed in DMD and other myopathies might be translatable to age‐related muscle weakness conditions such as sarcopenia (Marks, 2023, pp. 6–7; Umanskaya, 2015, pp. 33–37).

Mechanism of Action:
The fundamental mechanism of ARM210 action is based on the molecular pathology of RyR1 dysfunction in muscle aging. In healthy skeletal muscle, the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) is essential for rapid Ca²⁺ release from the SR during excitation–contraction coupling. Under normal conditions, the stabilizing protein FKBP12 (also known as calstabin1) binds to RyR1 to maintain the channel in a tightly closed state during diastole, thus preventing spontaneous Ca²⁺ leak (Andersson et al., 2011, pp. 1–2; Umanskaya, 2015, pp. 28–33). With aging, oxidative stress increases, leading to modifications such as oxidation and nitrosylation of RyR1. These post‐translational modifications disrupt the conformational integrity of the channel, weakening the binding affinity of FKBP12 for RyR1, and result in a “leaky” channel phenotype where pathological Ca²⁺ leak occurs during rest (Andersson et al., 2011, pp. 7–9; Forrester, 2018, pp. 63–68).
ARM210 exerts its therapeutic effect by binding directly to an oxidation-sensitive domain of RyR1. This binding enhances the re-association of FKBP12 to the receptor complex, thus re-stabilizing the closed state of the channel and significantly reducing SR Ca²⁺ leak (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Mitronova et al., 2023, pp. 2–4). As a result, the preservation of proper SR Ca²⁺ storage ensures that during muscle activation, the evoked Ca²⁺ transient amplitude is maintained or improved, which is critical for effective muscle contraction and fatigue resistance (Andersson & Marks, 2010, pp. 4–5; Umanskaya, 2015, pp. 33–37). From a biochemical perspective, this targeted stabilization does not rely on altering the post‐translational modification state of RyR1 itself but rather on securing the interaction between the receptor and its regulatory protein, thereby circumventing the consequences of oxidative modifications that are partially irreversible due to slow receptor turnover (Andersson et al., 2011, pp. 2–3; Umanskaya, 2015, pp. 33–37). This approach is unique because it offers specificity: ARM210 is designed to affect only RyR1 (predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle) without interfering with the function of RyR2 in the heart, an important consideration given the potential for off‐target effects (Marks, 2023, pp. 6–7; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Expected Effect:
Based on the mechanistic rationale, in preclinical assays using aged myotubes, ARM210 is expected to reduce the pathological SR Ca²⁺ leak that arises from RyR1 oxidation-induced dissociation of FKBP12. The reconstitution of the FKBP12–RyR1 interaction should restore proper Ca²⁺ handling by leading to an increase in evoked Ca²⁺ transient amplitude during muscle contraction. This improvement in Ca²⁺ signaling is predicted to enhance muscle contractility and endurance by mitigating the chronic Ca²⁺ leak that contributes to fatigue (Forrester, 2018, pp. 74–84; Umanskaya, 2015, pp. 33–37). In animal models, such as aged rodents, administration of ARM210 has been associated with improved muscle strength and reduced fatigue during exercise, indicating that similar benefits might be extrapolated to clinical cases of sarcopenia (Marks, 2023, pp. 6–7; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Since RyR1 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, particularly in myotubes and mature muscle fibers, the targeted action of ARM210 is expected to be robust in the cells relevant to sarcopenia. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic properties of ARM210, including its oral bioavailability and demonstrated muscle penetration in rodent studies, support its expected efficacy in enhancing muscle function in humans by ensuring adequate drug levels at the target tissue (Marks, 2023, pp. 1–2). The observed effect is not simply due to a general inhibition of calcium channels but is mediated by a highly specific restoration of the normal coupling machinery of RyR1, which under pathological conditions leads to chronic calcium leak, a primary contributor to muscle weakness and atrophy seen in sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Andersson et al., 2011, pp. 7–9).

Overall Evaluation:
ARM210 offers significant promise as a therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia by directly targeting a mechanistic root cause of age-related muscle weakness—pathological SR Ca²⁺ leak due to RyR1 oxidation and FKBP12 dissociation. The strengths of ARM210 lie in its highly specific mechanism of action, which offers a targeted therapeutic approach compared to non-specific calcium channel blockers. In preclinical studies, ARM210 has demonstrated both efficacy and favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including oral bioavailability and effective tissue penetration, particularly in skeletal muscle (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Armgo Pharma, Inc., 2020; Mitronova et al., 2023, pp. 2–4). The fact that ARM210 specifically stabilizes RyR1 without significant effect on RyR2 minimizes the risk of adverse cardiac effects, which is a critical consideration in an aging population often burdened with comorbid cardiovascular conditions (Marks, 2023, pp. 6–7; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, the translational promise of ARM210 is bolstered by its progression into preclinical large-animal studies and early-phase clinical trials in the context of RYR1-related myopathies, suggesting a pathway for future evaluation in sarcopenia (Armgo Pharma, Inc., 2020; O’Connor et al., 2023, pp. 11–13).

Nonetheless, there are also challenges and potential weaknesses that need to be considered. While the mechanism is well-supported by preclinical evidence, direct clinical data specifically in sarcopenia patients are still lacking. Most of the existing studies have focused on RYR1-related myopathies or dystrophic models, and though the mechanism is similar, sarcopenia may have additional underlying multifactorial influences such as hormonal changes, inflammatory mediators, and neuromuscular junction degeneration that might not be fully addressed by RyR1 stabilization alone (Agrawal, Suryakumar, & Rathor, 2018, pp. 10–11; Umanskaya, 2015, pp. 33–37). Another potential concern is the irreversible nature of some oxidative modifications and mitochondrial dysfunction seen in aged muscle; while ARM210 can stabilize RyR1 despite these changes, the long-term impact on muscle regeneration and function in severely aged tissues remains to be fully determined (Andersson et al., 2011, pp. 7–9; Forrester, 2018, pp. 74–84). However, given that RyR1 dysregulation is a central event in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia, the targeted intervention by ARM210 might still produce meaningful improvements even if other factors contribute to muscle decline.

Overall, ARM210 is a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of sarcopenia. Its targeted mechanism—stabilizing RyR1 via restoration of FKBP12 binding and reduction of pathological Ca²⁺ leak—directly addresses a critical molecular defect observed in aged skeletal muscle (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Marks, 2023, pp. 1–2; Umanskaya, 2015, pp. 28–33). The comprehensive preclinical evidence, combined with promising pharmacokinetic data and early clinical advancement in related RYR1 myopathies, supports further investigation of ARM210 in the context of age-related muscle weakness and sarcopenia. Future studies should aim to expand the clinical evaluation of ARM210 specifically in sarcopenic populations while also considering combination strategies that address additional contributing factors to sarcopenia such as systemic inflammation and neuromuscular degeneration. In conclusion, the strengths of ARM210—in terms of its specific molecular targeting, favorable pharmacological profile, and translational promise—make it a compelling candidate for further development against sarcopenia, although careful clinical validation in the appropriate populations is warranted (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Armgo Pharma, Inc., 2020; Marks, 2023, pp. 6–7).

Urolithin A,"Proposal for Urolithin A

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Urolithin A is a naturally occurring metabolite produced by the gut microbiota through the transformation of dietary ellagitannins and ellagic acid—polyphenolic compounds that are abundant in foods such as pomegranates, berries, and walnuts. In the digestive tract, ingested ellagitannins are hydrolyzed to yield ellagic acid, which downstream gut microbial enzymes convert into a series of urolithins, with Urolithin A emerging as one of the most bioactive and abundantly studied compounds in this family (Alldritt et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2023). Urolithin A belongs to a class of bioavailable polyphenol metabolites known broadly as urolithins. By virtue of its microbial origin, Urolithin A represents a type of postbiotic—a compound whose formation is dependent on both dietary intake and the specific enzymatic repertoire of an individual’s microbiome. This natural compound has been isolated from biological samples, and its production has also been replicated through synthetic chemistry approaches, relying on reagents such as 2-bromo-5-hydroxybenzoic acid and resorcinol in copper sulfate–catalyzed processes to achieve high purity (Lin et al., 2023). The class of urolithins, as a whole, has been previously studied for a variety of biological effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and mitophagy‐promoting actions, which have been linked with improved metabolic and muscular outcomes (Shetty et al., 2024; Rodriguez et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
Over the past decade, Urolithin A has emerged as a promising candidate for addressing conditions related to mitochondrial dysfunction, aging, and muscle degeneration. Early clinical investigations have focused on its capacity to improve muscle mitochondrial function and exercise endurance in older subjects. Several registered clinical trials, including those identified by ClinicalTrials.gov searches for “Urolithin A AND (sarcopenia OR muscle OR aging)” and specific studies like NCT03283462 and NCT06556706 (ClinicalTrials.gov; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024), have evaluated its potential to improve muscle strength, endurance, and overall bioenergetics in aged populations. In these studies, endpoints such as 6-minute walk test distance, ATP synthesis rates via Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, and muscle biopsy assessments of mitochondrial markers were used to gauge efficacy. Complementary preclinical studies in animal models have also demonstrated that Urolithin A induces mitophagy, extends lifespan in organisms like Caenorhabditis elegans, and improves muscle function in rodents, including models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Faitg et al., 2024). These studies have provided proof-of-concept evidence that Urolithin A can reverse age-associated declines in mitochondrial activity and muscle performance, providing rationale for further exploration in the context of sarcopenia—a condition characterized by reduced muscle mass, strength, and functional capacity (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
The therapeutic potential of Urolithin A in treating sarcopenia lies principally in its ability to activate mitophagy—the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria—and thereby restore mitochondrial quality and function in aging muscle cells. At the molecular level, Urolithin A has been shown to upregulate markers of mitophagy, such as Parkin and PINK1, which are critical for identifying and tagging dysfunctional mitochondria for autophagic removal (Faitg et al., 2024). In aged myotubes, and particularly in conditions of sarcopenia, mitochondrial dysfunction plays a significant role in impairing cellular energy production. Urolithin A reportedly induces a cascade of events that culminates in the restoration of mitochondrial–sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) contact sites. These specialized junctions, often referred to as mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAMs), are integral for coupling SR Ca²⁺ release to mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, a critical process underlying efficient bioenergetic responses during contraction (Unknown Reference). Restoration of these contact sites ensures that mitochondria not only receive Ca²⁺ signals necessary for activating oxidative phosphorylation but also help buffer cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels, thereby refining the kinetics of Ca²⁺ transients that drive muscle contraction (Ghosh et al., 2022; Nishimoto et al., 2023).

Biochemically, Urolithin A exerts its effects by modulating pathways that converge on mitochondrial homeostasis. It appears to activate components of the autophagic machinery that enhance the degradation of impaired mitochondria, simultaneously promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and reorganization of mitochondrial networks (Hou et al., 2024). Specifically, it increases the expression of key proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics and quality control, such as those in the PINK1-Parkin pathway, and may also interact with other regulatory molecules that control the structural integrity of the mitochondria–SR interface. The integrity of this interface is crucial, as it governs the efficiency of Ca²⁺ signals that initiate ATP production during muscle contraction. Moreover, Urolithin A’s impact on mitochondrial function indirectly affects the overall redox state and energy balance within muscle cells, providing a protective mechanism against the oxidative stress typically encountered in aged or diseased muscle (Lin et al., 2023; Madsen et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay focused on aged myotubes and muscle tissue, Urolithin A is expected to exert a multifaceted therapeutic effect. First, by activating mitophagy, it is anticipated to clear dysfunctional mitochondria, allowing for the generation of a healthier mitochondrial population. This restoration of mitochondrial health is expected to normalize mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, a process critical for modulating ATP synthesis and coordinating Ca²⁺ transients with SR release events during muscle contraction. Given the central role of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ handling in bioenergetics and contractility, improved mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake should enhance the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, leading directly to increased contractile endurance of muscle fibers (Faitg et al., 2024; Nishimoto et al., 2023).

Furthermore, by restoring mitochondrial–SR contact sites, Urolithin A is predicted to re-establish the precise spatial and functional coupling necessary for rapid and controlled Ca²⁺ transfer between the SR and mitochondria. This re-coupling is especially crucial in aged muscle, where disorganized organelle networks contribute to impaired Ca²⁺ dynamics and diminished muscle strength. The normalization of Ca²⁺ transient kinetics is likely to be reflected in increased muscle endurance and reduced fatigue during repetitive or sustained contractions, which are key clinical manifestations of sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; Nishimoto et al., 2023).

At the molecular level, studies in human volunteers and animal models have demonstrated that Urolithin A supplementation leads to an upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis markers, a decrease in plasma acylcarnitine levels (indicative of improved fatty acid oxidation), and a reduction in inflammatory cytokines that are often elevated in aging muscle (Hou et al., 2024; Faitg et al., 2024). The convergence of these effects supports the hypothesis that Urolithin A will improve muscle bioenergetics and contractile performance through a mechanism that integrates enhanced mitochondrial quality control with the preservation of intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis. Thus, in the assay context, one would expect a significant improvement in the parameters associated with mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, enhanced contractile endurance, and a restoration of normal Ca²⁺ transient kinetics in aged myotubes (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Ghosh et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
The collective body of evidence suggests that Urolithin A is a promising therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia. Among its strengths is its natural origin and established safety profile; multiple clinical trials have confirmed that Urolithin A is orally bioavailable, well tolerated, and capable of exerting beneficial effects on mitochondrial health in older adults (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; Heilman et al., 2017). Its ability to target mitochondrial dysfunction—a central aspect of the pathophysiology of sarcopenia—by activating mitophagy and restoring mitochondrial–SR contact sites directly addresses key mechanisms underlying muscle aging and weakness (Faitg et al., 2024; Nishimoto et al., 2023).

The specific mechanism of restoring mitochondrial–SR coupling and normalizing Ca²⁺ uptake represents a novel strategy that goes beyond traditional approaches such as direct muscle stimulation or anti-inflammatory therapies. This mechanism leverages the intrinsic cellular repair processes to re-establish bioenergetic balance and improve contractile function, which are vital for mitigating the functional deficits seen in sarcopenia. Preclinical studies further support this approach by demonstrating improvements in muscle strength and endurance, along with molecular signatures indicative of enhanced mitochondrial function (Unknown Reference; Faitg et al., 2024; Ghosh et al., 2022).

On the other hand, several weaknesses or challenges remain. First, there is significant inter-individual variability in natural Urolithin A production due to differences in gut microbiome composition. Consequently, while supplementation can overcome this variability, it remains to be fully elucidated whether chronic administration in a broader sarcopenic population will yield uniformly positive outcomes (Nishimoto et al., 2023; Shetty et al., 2024). Secondly, while multiple clinical trials have demonstrated improvements in muscle endurance and mitochondrial health, endpoint measures that directly correlate with clinically meaningful improvements in sarcopenia—such as increases in lean muscle mass or improvements in physical performance scores—are still emerging and require further validation in larger-scale phase III studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2025).

Additionally, while the proposed mechanism involving restoration of mitochondrial–SR contact sites is compelling, it remains mechanistically complex with potential off-target effects that are not yet fully characterized. The relationship between Ca²⁺ transient kinetics, mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, and overall muscle performance is influenced by a multitude of regulatory proteins and signaling pathways. Fine-tuning these interactions through Urolithin A supplementation might require careful dose optimization to avoid unintended disruptions in Ca²⁺ homeostasis (Faitg et al., 2024; Shetty et al., 2024). Another consideration is the long‐term safety profile of chronic Urolithin A administration in a patient population that is typically elderly and may have multiple comorbidities; however, early-phase clinical data so far have suggested a favorable safety profile (Heilman et al., 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018).

In summary, Urolithin A represents a strong candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for sarcopenia due to its well-supported mechanism in promoting mitophagy, restoring mitochondrial–SR connectivity, and normalizing Ca²⁺ handling in muscle cells. Its successful translation is further bolstered by robust preclinical studies and emerging clinical evidence, all of which point to improvements in muscle endurance and bioenergetics in aged populations. The strengths of this candidate include its natural derivation from dietary polyphenols, established oral bioavailability, multifaceted mechanism of action targeting mitochondrial quality control, and early evidence of efficacy in enhancing muscle performance. Weaknesses include inter-individual variability in gut microbial metabolism that necessitates supplementation, the need for further validation in large-scale clinical studies, and the potential complexities of modulating intracellular Ca²⁺ dynamics in aged or diseased muscle tissue.

Overall, from a drug development perspective, Urolithin A is a promising candidate that aligns with a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of sarcopenia. The available biochemical, clinical, and mechanistic data support its further investigation through well-designed clinical trials that focus specifically on endpoints relevant to muscle mass, strength, and functional performance in elderly subjects afflicted by sarcopenia. Future studies should aim to optimize dosing regimens, evaluate long-term impacts on muscle quality and functional outcomes, and further elucidate the molecular pathways involved in its action, including its influence on mitochondrial–SR contact sites and Ca²⁺ handling. Given these factors, Urolithin A merits continued preclinical and clinical development as a repurposed drug candidate for the treatment of sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Faitg et al., 2024; Nishimoto et al., 2023; Shetty et al., 2024).

GKT137831 (Setanaxib),"Proposal for GKT137831 (Setanaxib)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
GKT137831, also known as Setanaxib, is a small-molecule inhibitor originally developed to selectively inhibit NADPH oxidase isoforms NOX1 and NOX4. Chemically, it belongs to the pyrazolopyridine dione structural class and was discovered through a drug development program focused on the mitigation of oxidative stress–mediated tissue fibrosis. The molecule was synthesized based on the rationale that excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by NOX enzymes plays a central role in fibrotic disease processes. As such, as a member of the NADPH oxidase inhibitor class, GKT137831 is intended to reduce oxidative injury by specifically blocking NOX1/4 activity. Members of this class have been used extensively in preclinical models to alleviate fibrosis in organs such as the lung, liver, kidney, and heart by attenuating ROS generation, thereby modulating downstream inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways (Teixeira et al., 2017). Its chemical properties ensure oral bioavailability and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, with established human pharmacokinetic data and safety profiles from early clinical trials indicating that it is well tolerated (Sassetti et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
GKT137831’s therapeutic history is largely centered on the treatment of fibrotic and oxidative stress–related diseases. In preclinical studies, GKT137831 has demonstrated efficacy in reducing tissue fibrosis in animal models of diabetic nephropathy, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis, and even in cardiac remodeling associated with hypertension (Teixeira et al., 2017; Hammers, 2022). Clinical development has progressed to Phase I and Phase II studies, particularly in conditions such as diabetic nephropathy and primary biliary cholangitis, where the drug has shown evidence of reducing oxidative stress markers and inflammation, with a safety profile that is adaptable for chronic treatment (Calliditas Therapeutics AB, 2013; Calliditas Therapeutics AB, 2017). Although a direct clinical trial in sarcopenia or muscle wasting disorders has not yet been reported, extensive clinical trial searches using terms “Setanaxib,” “GKT137831,” “NOX4 inhibitor,” and “muscle OR sarcopenia OR RyR1 OR SERCA” have yielded thousands of studies exploring the compound’s effects in a variety of indications (ClinicalTrials.gov). In addition, preclinical research in contexts of cancer cachexia—as demonstrated in murine pancreatic cancer models—indicates that inhibition of NOX4 can rescue muscle atrophy and weakness (Dasgupta et al., 2020). Given that sarcopenia shares underlying hallmarks of oxidative stress–driven muscle degradation with cachexia, GKT137831’s therapeutic merit is increasingly being considered for repurposing in age-related muscle loss.

Mechanism of Action:
GKT137831 exerts its effects by directly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of NOX1 and NOX4. Under physiological conditions, NOX enzymes generate ROS as secondary messengers; however, during pathological states such as fibrosis and aging, excessive NOX activity leads to oxidative damage. NOX4, in particular, is constitutively active and produces hydrogen peroxide and, to a lesser extent, superoxide, contributing significantly to the chronic oxidative milieu observed in aged skeletal muscle (Sakellariou & McDonagh, 2018). The elevated ROS in aging muscle results in redox post-translational modifications (PTMs) affecting critical proteins involved in intracellular calcium management such as the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA). Oxidative modification of RyR1 is known to destabilize its interaction with calstabin, thereby increasing pathological sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca²⁺ leak, while SERCA function is similarly impaired by oxidative stress, resulting in reduced calcium reuptake (Regan et al., 2017; Damiano et al., 2019). The inhibition of NOX4 by GKT137831 is hypothesized to lower these oxidative modifications, thereby preserving the structural integrity and function of these calcium-handling proteins. Biochemically, this involves preventing oxidation of key cysteine residues on RyR1 and SERCA, stabilizing the excitation–contraction coupling processes in skeletal muscle fibers. In model systems, NOX4 upregulation has been linked to increased activation of stress-responsive pathways, including NF-κB and FOXO transcription factors, which in turn induce expression of muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases (MuRF1, Atrogin-1) that promote protein degradation (Dasgupta et al., 2020). Thus, by blocking NOX4 activity, GKT137831 not only reduces ROS production but may also attenuate downstream catabolic signaling cascades that contribute to muscle atrophy (Dasgupta et al., 2020). Its action is selective, sparing NOX2 and preserving innate immune functions, which is crucial given the potential risks of broad-spectrum antioxidant therapies (Teixeira et al., 2017).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing GKT137831 in sarcopenia is that by inhibiting NOX4 in aged human myotubes, the compound will lower ROS-mediated oxidative modifications of both RyR1 and SERCA. This biochemical intervention is expected to reduce pathological SR Ca²⁺ leak, thereby restoring both the amplitude and kinetics of Ca²⁺ transients necessary for optimal muscle contraction. In aged skeletal muscle, oxidative stress leads to modifications of RyR1 that promote dissociation of regulatory subunits like calstabin, ultimately causing a chronic calcium leak that impairs muscle force generation (Waning et al., 2015). Similarly, SERCA, which is responsible for pumping Ca²⁺ back into the SR, suffers from reduced activity due to oxidative damage, further exacerbating muscle weakness and fatigue (Sakellariou & McDonagh, 2018). The application of GKT137831 is therefore anticipated to mitigate these deleterious modifications by reducing the source of oxidation and subsequently restoring proper calcium homeostasis. Preclinical data from cancer cachexia models have shown that administration of GKT137831 results in preserved muscle mass and strength, improvements attributed to lowered oxidative stress in muscle tissue (Dasgupta et al., 2020; Hammers, 2022). Given that NOX4 is expressed in skeletal muscle and its activity is implicated in the oxidative modifications of calcium-handling proteins, it is plausible that improved Ca²⁺ transients and muscle contractility would be observed in aged myotubes treated with GKT137831. The expected effect in assays would be a restoration of normal Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and kinetics, reductions in markers of oxidative stress, and subsequent improvements in muscle function. If human myotubes from aged subjects are used in vitro, one would predict reduced protein carbonylation and normalized function of RyR1 and SERCA, consistent with the drug’s mechanism observed in fibrotic models and cachexia studies (Dasgupta et al., 2020; Hammers, 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
GKT137831 (Setanaxib) represents a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in sarcopenia based on its established pharmacological profile and mechanistic specificity. One of its greatest strengths is its clinical-stage status: GKT137831 has already been evaluated in multiple Phase I and Phase II trials in disorders of fibrosis and oxidative injury, and it has demonstrated favorable safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (Calliditas Therapeutics AB, 2013, 2017, 2020). This safety pedigree and robust human PK data reduce some of the translational risk associated with repurposing. From a mechanistic perspective, the hypothesis that NOX4-driven oxidative stress contributes significantly to pathological changes in RyR1 and SERCA function in aging muscles is well founded. The biochemical rationale is supported by abundant evidence that oxidative modifications to these proteins lead to abnormal calcium leak, impaired excitation–contraction coupling, and reduced muscle contractility—all hallmark features of sarcopenia (Regan et al., 2017; Damiano et al., 2019; Sakellariou & McDonagh, 2018). GKT137831’s ability to specifically target NOX4 positions it as an elegant means of interfering with the underlying redox pathology that has been implicated in the aging process of skeletal muscle. Moreover, preclinical data in contexts such as cancer cachexia, where similar oxidative stress pathways have been implicated, illustrate that NOX4 inhibition can rescue muscle function and mass (Hammers, 2022; Dasgupta et al., 2020).

However, several weaknesses or gaps remain. First, while there is compelling correlative data linking NOX4 activity to muscle dysfunction in various models, direct evidence in the context of age-related sarcopenia remains limited. The extrapolation from fibrotic and cachexia models to sarcopenia is mechanistically plausible but requires further experimental validation in appropriate aging models. Second, while the hypothesis focuses on the reduction of redox modifications on RyR1 and SERCA, most of the current literature emphasizes NOX4’s role in fibrosis and muscle atrophy broadly rather than specific effects on calcium handling proteins. It is critical to assess whether treatment with GKT137831 indeed translates to improved Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and kinetics in aged human myotubes and, ultimately, improved muscle function in vivo (Teixeira et al., 2017; Dasgupta et al., 2020). Third, although the safety data from other disease domains is encouraging, the muscle-specific dosing, efficacy, and potential off-target effects in an aging population may differ. Detailed dose–response studies and pharmacodynamic markers specific to muscle physiology are needed before confidently advancing the drug for clinical trials in sarcopenia.

Overall, the strengths of GKT137831 include its well-validated mechanism of action through the inhibition of NOX4, its established clinical safety profile, and its potential to intervene in the key pathological processes of oxidative stress and calcium mishandling in aged skeletal muscle. The weaknesses relate to the need for direct experimental and clinical evidence in models of sarcopenia, particularly with respect to its effects on RyR1 and SERCA function and the correction of calcium leak. Given the extensive preclinical evidence supporting NOX4 involvement in muscle atrophy pathways and the solid clinical foundation in other oxidative stress–related diseases (Hammers, 2022; Dasgupta et al., 2020), repurposing GKT137831 for sarcopenia is a promising and scientifically robust direction that warrants further investigation. Future work should prioritize detailed in vitro studies in aged human myotubes followed by translational in vivo studies in aged animal models to confirm its impact on calcium homeostasis and muscle function before proceeding to clinical trials in sarcopenic populations. Ultimately, the capacity to modulate NOX4-mediated oxidative modifications and restore proper Ca²⁺ handling could represent a breakthrough in treating age-related muscle loss and improving the quality of life in the elderly (Dasgupta et al., 2020; Teixeira et al., 2017).

S107 (K201/JTV519),"Proposal for S107 (K201/JTV519)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
S107, also known by its alternate names K201 and JTV519, is a synthetic small molecule belonging to the Rycal class of compounds. Originally discovered and developed for its cardioprotective properties, S107 emerged from efforts to stabilize ryanodine receptors (RyRs), the intracellular Ca²⁺ release channels that govern excitation–contraction (E–C) coupling in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. Chemically, S107 is a derivative of the 1,4-benzothiazepine class, and its development involved systematic structure–activity relationship studies to enhance its specificity for the RyR channel complex. It was designed to bind near the site where the regulatory protein FKBP12 (also known as calstabin1 in skeletal muscle) interacts with RyR1, thereby reinforcing this interaction. Rycals like S107 have previously been used to correct abnormal Ca²⁺ leak in various contexts such as heart failure, muscular dystrophy, and stress-induced muscle fatigue by stabilizing the closed state of the RyR channels and preventing the dissociation of FKBP12 (Andersson & Marks, 2010; Bellinger et al., 2008). This candidate is therefore being repurposed from its initial application in cardiomyopathy to address the pathological calcium dysregulation that underlies sarcopenia—a condition characterized by age-related muscle weakness and atrophy. The natural origins of S107 are synthetic in nature; its chemical synthesis was optimized for oral bioavailability and in vivo stability, essential characteristics for any drug intended for chronic administration in aged patients (Andersson & Marks, 2010).

Therapeutic History:
S107 has a well-documented history in preclinical therapeutic research. Initially, this compound was explored for its ability to stabilize RyR channels in the context of heart failure, where dysfunctional RyR2 channels lose their stabilizing calstabin subunits, leading to arrhythmogenic Ca²⁺ leak. Several studies have shown that by enhancing the binding of calstabin to RyR channels, S107 improves cardiac contractility and reduces arrhythmias in animal models (Wehrens et al., 2005; Andersson & Marks, 2010). Beyond its cardiovascular applications, S107 has been assessed for its potential in skeletal muscle disorders including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). In these conditions, excessive Ca²⁺ leak from RyR1 due to oxidation, nitrosylation, and phosphorylation results in impaired muscle force generation and contributes to muscle degeneration (Andersson et al., 2012; Umanskaya et al., 2012). Notably, preclinical models of muscular dystrophy have demonstrated that treatment with S107 can restore intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis, improve tetanic Ca²⁺ transients, increase specific force production, and even enhance exercise capacity (Umanskaya et al., 2012; Bellinger et al., 2008). Although research directly targeting sarcopenia with S107 is less abundant, the mechanistic similarities between RyR1-mediated Ca²⁺ leak in dystrophic conditions and age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction have fueled interest in repurposing S107 for sarcopenia. In aged muscle, alterations in RyR1 channel function—such as increased oxidation and decreased binding of FKBP12—lead to chronic Ca²⁺ leak and impaired excitation–contraction coupling (Agrawal et al., 2018; Andersson et al., 2011). Preclinical studies in aged rodents have already demonstrated that Rycal compounds can improve muscle function even without concomitant changes in muscle mass, signifying an improvement in muscle quality rather than quantity (Andersson et al., 2012; Forrester, 2018). Such findings provide a strong rationale for further investigating S107 in the context of sarcopenia, particularly given its established safety profile in rodent studies and its oral bioavailability.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, S107 acts by binding to a regulatory region on the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1), which is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle. Under normal physiological conditions, RyR1 is coupled to the stabilizing protein FKBP12 (calstabin1) that maintains the receptor in its closed, non-leaky state during muscle relaxation. In the aging process and in various myopathies, RyR1 undergoes pathological post-translational modifications including oxidation, S-nitrosylation, and hyperphosphorylation. These modifications reduce the binding affinity of FKBP12, leading to dissociation of this regulatory subunit and resulting in an increased open probability (Po) of the RyR1 channel. The chronic Ca²⁺ leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) thus initiated not only disrupts Ca²⁺ homeostasis but also triggers deleterious downstream signaling events such as activation of calpain proteases and mitochondrial dysfunction (Andersson et al., 2011; Forrester, 2018). S107 specifically binds near the FKBP12 regulatory site on RyR1, reinstating the association between FKBP12 and the channel. This stabilization reduces the pathological Ca²⁺ leak and normalizes the excitation–contraction (E–C) coupling process. Electrophysiological studies in both dystrophic and aged muscle models have shown that S107 effectively lowers the open probability of the “leaky” RyR1 channels, thereby improving tetanic Ca²⁺ transients and overall muscle function (Andersson et al., 2011; Umanskaya et al., 2012). The binding of S107 does not reverse the underlying oxidative modifications per se but rather acts to “lock” the RyR1 channel in a state less susceptible to leak by ensuring that FKBP12 remains bound—a mechanism that is critical for maintaining SR Ca²⁺ store integrity and proper Ca²⁺ release upon muscle activation (Andersson et al., 2011; Dridi et al., 2022). In summary, S107 operates by correcting the abnormal molecular conformation of RyR1 that arises in aging, ensuring that excitation–contraction coupling is preserved through maintained intracellular Ca²⁺ signaling fidelity.

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing S107 in sarcopenia is that it will reinstate the stable association of FKBP12 with RyR1 in aged skeletal myotubes, thereby curbing chronic SR Ca²⁺ leak and recovering the amplitude and reliability of Ca²⁺ transients that are essential for proper muscle contraction. This effect is expected to manifest in several measurable improvements. First, restoration of normal Ca²⁺ signaling should lead to an increased amplitude of tetanic Ca²⁺ transients during muscle excitation. Enhanced Ca²⁺ release results in more efficient coupling between electrical stimulation and muscle contraction, which is observable as improved muscle-specific force generation. Indeed, previous ex vivo studies have reported that treatment with S107 can normalize Ca²⁺ transient amplitudes and enhance contractile strength even in muscle fibers that are compromised by pathological Ca²⁺ leak (Agrawal et al., 2018; Andersson et al., 2011). Second, by reducing pathological Ca²⁺ leak, S107 should diminish the chronic activation of Ca²⁺-dependent proteases (such as calpains) that contribute to muscle protein degradation and atrophy. This protective effect indirectly supports better muscle function over time without necessarily increasing muscle mass, thus improving muscle quality, a key parameter in sarcopenia. Third, stabilization of the RyR1 channel may also interrupt the deleterious feed-forward cycle that links Ca²⁺ dysregulation to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, as abnormal Ca²⁺ handling can lead to mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overload and subsequent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Improvement in mitochondrial function is critical for sustaining muscle endurance and fatigue resistance, particularly in the context of aging (Andersson et al., 2012; Dridi et al., 2020). Moreover, the candidate has been shown to be orally bioavailable and well-tolerated in rodent studies, suggesting favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. In the context of assays using aged myotubes or muscle fibers, we would expect that S107 treatment would result in enhanced Ca²⁺ transient amplitude under controlled stimulation protocols, decreased resting cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels indicative of reduced leak, and improved contractile performance under fatigue protocols. These effects have been corroborated by previous biochemical and electrophysiological studies in both dystrophic and aged muscle, where administration of S107 led to normalization of RyR1 function (Andersson et al., 2011; Forrester, 2018). Additionally, since human skeletal muscle expresses RyR1 and its regulatory protein FKBP12—with expression patterns well conserved between rodents and humans—the expected molecular interactions are directly relevant to the target cell type in sarcopenia (Meyer et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
In synthesizing the available literature across biochemical, clinical, and preclinical studies, S107 emerges as a highly promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia. Its mechanism—to stabilize RyR1 via enhanced FKBP12 binding—addresses a central pathophysiological process in age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction: the chronic, pathological leak of Ca²⁺ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum that disrupts excitation–contraction coupling and triggers deleterious downstream effects such as protease activation and mitochondrial stress. The strengths of S107 include its well-characterized mechanism of action, evident from studies employing electrophysiological measurements that demonstrate a normalization of RyR1 channel open probability and restoration of Ca²⁺ transient amplitudes (Andersson et al., 2011; Umanskaya et al., 2012). Its oral bioavailability and established tolerability in rodent models are significant advantages, particularly for long-term treatment paradigms such as those required in chronic age-related conditions. Moreover, its previous applications in models of muscular dystrophy—and by extension, in conditions marked by similar RyR1 remodeling—suggest that the molecular defect targeted by S107 is common to multiple forms of muscle weakness, thereby broadening its potential utility (Andersson et al., 2012; Bellinger et al., 2008).

However, there are also caveats that warrant careful consideration. Although the preclinical data are highly supportive, direct clinical evidence in human sarcopenia remains limited. Most studies have been performed in rodent models or in the context of muscular dystrophy, and while mechanistic similarities are compelling, clinical translation may uncover unforeseen complexities given the multifactorial nature of sarcopenia. Sarcopenia in humans is not solely driven by RyR1-mediated Ca²⁺ leak; hormonal changes, systemic inflammation, neuromuscular junction alterations, and physical inactivity all contribute to its progression. Therefore, while S107 may address a critical component of the disease pathology, it might need to be combined with other interventions to achieve optimal clinical benefit. Additionally, the long-term safety profile in the elderly population, who often present with comorbidities and polypharmacy, requires rigorous evaluation. Off-target effects have been a concern with earlier RyR modulators, though S107 has been noted for its relatively high target specificity compared to preceding molecules such as JTV519 (Andersson & Marks, 2010; Kushnir & Marks, 2012).

From a biochemical perspective, the proposed mechanism is robust. Numerous studies have verified that the maintenance of FKBP12 binding to RyR1 is critical for preventing pathological Ca²⁺ leak, which in turn supports proper excitation–contraction coupling. The detailed molecular interactions, including the role of post-translational modifications such as oxidation and nitrosylation on RyR1 that predispose it to FKBP12 dissociation, are well established. S107’s ability to counteract these modifications, not by directly reversing them but by reinforcing the channel’s closed state, fits neatly into our current understanding of muscle physiology and pathology (Andersson et al., 2011; Dridi et al., 2020). FRET-based evidence provided by Rebbeck et al. (Sci Rep, 2020)—although not included in our current context—aligns with data from other studies showing improved FKBP12–RyR1 binding after S107 treatment (Agrawal et al., 2018). This convergence of independent lines of evidence strengthens the mechanistic underpinning of the candidate’s expected effects.

Regarding the expected effect, the restoration of proper Ca²⁺ signaling in aged skeletal myotubes is a particularly attractive outcome. Increased amplitude and consistency of Ca²⁺ transients should translate into enhanced muscle contractility and resistance to fatigue. This is critical not only for improving physical performance and quality of life in elderly individuals but also for potentially slowing the progression of muscle atrophy that characterizes sarcopenia. Given that sarcopenia involves a decline in muscle function that often precedes measurable loss in muscle mass, the beneficial effects of S107 on muscle quality—as opposed to mere muscle size—are especially valuable (Agrawal et al., 2018; Forrester, 2018).

In summary, S107 has demonstrated considerable promise as a therapeutic candidate for conditions related to dysfunctional Ca²⁺ handling, including various forms of muscular dystrophy and potentially sarcopenia. Its mechanism of action is mechanistically coherent and supported by data from rigorous biochemical and electrophysiological studies that document its ability to stabilize RyR1 channels by preserving FKBP12 binding. The fact that S107 is orally bioavailable with an acceptable safety profile in preclinical studies further bolsters its candidacy. Nonetheless, careful attention must be paid to the inherent complexity of sarcopenia as a multifactorial disease, and future studies should aim to validate these findings in clinical settings with aged human populations. Strengths of S107 include its precise mechanism of action, strong preclinical data, and potential to improve muscle quality by directly correcting a key molecular defect, while weaknesses pertain primarily to the limited clinical validation in sarcopenia per se and the need for a comprehensive safety evaluation in an older demographic. Overall, the literature reviewed provides a compelling rationale for advancing S107 into further preclinical and early-phase clinical trials for sarcopenia, with the expectation that its ability to restore proper Ca²⁺ homeostasis could afford significant functional benefits to aging skeletal muscle (Andersson et al., 2011; Dridi et al., 2020; Umanskaya et al., 2012).

Rolipram,"Proposal for Rolipram

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rolipram is a small‐molecule, synthetic compound originally developed as a selective phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor. It was first synthesized several decades ago and belongs to a class of compounds that work by inhibiting the degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), thereby elevating its intracellular concentration. As a PDE4 inhibitor, rolipram has been mainly evaluated in preclinical settings for its anti‐inflammatory properties, neuroprotective effects, and potential benefits in mood disorders. The chemical origins of rolipram trace back to early synthetic medicinal chemistry efforts targeting cAMP metabolism, and its overall profile has been well characterized in cardiac, vascular, and central nervous system (CNS) tissues (Crocetti et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2019). Rolipram’s inclusion in this drug class is significant because PDE4 inhibitors have a long history of both experimental and clinical investigation for conditions where modulation of cAMP levels is therapeutically beneficial. Generally, compounds in this class have been used to counteract inflammation and to modulate CNS signaling; however, the unique mechanism by which they elevate cAMP has recently garnered interest as a potentially effective means to address impaired calcium handling and contractile dysfunction in muscle tissues.

Therapeutic History:
Historically, rolipram was evaluated primarily for its anti‐inflammatory and CNS benefits. In preclinical models, it has demonstrated the ability to enhance cardiac contractility by modulating local cAMP levels in microdomains associated with the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in cardiomyocytes, where it increases the phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) and thereby augments the activity of the SR Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) (Beca et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2019). In cardiovascular research, rolipram has been shown to improve relaxation kinetics and contractile function through its specific elevation of cAMP and subsequent PKA activation, which is essential for proper Ca2+ cycling (Kaneda et al., 2010). Outside the cardiovascular field, PDE4 inhibitors also have been investigated for their protective effects in models of sepsis‐induced dysfunction and inflammatory conditions in other tissues, and agents in this class have demonstrated oral bioavailability along with well‐documented CNS effects (Ji et al., 2020). Despite these promising attributes and extensive research in related areas, there has been only limited direct investigation of rolipram for muscle wasting conditions such as sarcopenia. A clinical trial search using the terms “Rolipram AND muscle,” “PDE4 inhibitor AND sarcopenia,” “Rolipram AND aging,” and “Rolipram AND muscle function” has so far not yielded any directly registered clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov). However, preclinical studies in animal models and muscle cell systems have provided evidence that PDE4 inhibition may enhance muscle function and counteract atrophic processes, as demonstrated by improved proteolysis markers and enhanced relaxation kinetics in skeletal muscle preparations (Lira et al., 2011; Qaisar et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
Rolipram specifically inhibits PDE4, which is one of several families of phosphodiesterases responsible for hydrolyzing cAMP. Under normal physiological conditions, PDE4 functions to tightly regulate cAMP levels to ensure that signaling events downstream of cAMP are precisely controlled. Inhibition of PDE4 by rolipram prevents the degradation of cAMP, thereby resulting in a localized accumulation of this critical second messenger. Elevated cAMP, in turn, activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates multiple target proteins. One such well‐characterized target is phospholamban (PLN), a regulatory protein expressed in both cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. Under basal conditions, PLN binds to and inhibits SERCA, the enzyme responsible for pumping Ca2+ from the cytosol back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a process essential for muscle relaxation following contraction. Once phosphorylated by PKA, PLN undergoes a conformational change and dissociates from SERCA, effectively “relieving” its inhibition. This modification leads to an increase in SERCA activity, enhancing Ca2+ reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and thereby accelerating the decay of cytosolic Ca2+ transients during muscle relaxation (Beca et al., 2011; Stathopoulou et al., 2019). Enhanced SERCA-mediated calcium uptake not only improves relaxation kinetics but also contributes to more effective muscle contraction-relaxation cycles overall. Evidence for this mechanism is supported by studies in Langendorff-perfused isolated hearts where rolipram increased left ventricular pressures and contractility through PKA-mediated PLN phosphorylation (Beca et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2019). Moreover, in skeletal muscle models, PDE4 inhibition has been associated with reduced proteolysis and improved muscle protein synthesis, which may be attributed at least in part to improvements in intracellular calcium handling via the cAMP/PKA pathway (Lira et al., 2011). Although most mechanistic studies have been conducted in cardiac muscle or vascular smooth muscle, the relevant molecules—cAMP, PKA, PLN, and SERCA—are also expressed in skeletal muscle. Thus, the same signaling cascade is expected to operate in aged myotubes, where impaired SERCA activity and diminished PLN phosphorylation contribute to suboptimal Ca2+ homeostasis, a key feature of sarcopenia (Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). Additionally, studies on mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle have indicated that PDE4 inhibitors like rolipram can activate alternative pathways (for example, AMPK/Sirt1) that are essential for mitochondrial function and overall muscle health (Park et al., 2021). Together, these actions support a model in which rolipram’s ability to elevate cAMP and activate PKA-mediated PLN phosphorylation underlies its potential to enhance SERCA activity and thereby improve calcium reuptake efficiency in aging muscle cells.

Expected Effect:
Based on the above mechanism, the expected effect of rolipram in a sarcopenia model would be multifaceted. In aged myotubes or skeletal muscle tissues from sarcopenic subjects, the impairment of calcium reuptake due to reduced SERCA activity is a major contributor to diminished contractile function and defective relaxation kinetics. The PDE4 inhibitory action of rolipram is anticipated to elevate intracellular cAMP levels, thereby activating PKA and promoting the phosphorylation of PLN. With phosphorylated PLN unable to inhibit SERCA effectively, the enzyme’s activity would recover, leading to accelerated Ca2+ reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This improvement in calcium handling would be expected to enhance both the relaxation phase (by faster clearance of Ca2+ from the cytosol) and potentially the subsequent contraction phase (by ensuring greater availability of Ca2+ in the SR for release upon stimulation) (Qaisar et al., 2020; Ray & Shibaguchi, 2021). In vitro assays using aged myotubes are likely to show an increased rate of Ca2+ transient decay, improved force generation, and perhaps improved endurance parameters in response to rolipram treatment. Expression analyses should verify that key components of the cAMP/PKA/PLN/SERCA pathway are present in skeletal muscle cells. Indeed, previous studies have confirmed that phospholamban is expressed in skeletal muscle, albeit with some isoform differences compared to cardiac muscle, and that it plays a crucial role in modulating SERCA activity (Stathopoulou et al., 2019; Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). Furthermore, rolipram may also exert beneficial anti‐proteolytic effects in skeletal muscle. Elevated cAMP is known to inhibit pathways leading to muscle protein degradation such as those mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Lira et al., 2011), suggesting that rolipram might help preserve muscle mass in addition to improving contractile function. Together, these expected outcomes suggest that rolipram could counteract two key pathological hallmarks of sarcopenia: impaired calcium handling and enhanced muscle proteolysis.

Overall Evaluation:
Rolipram presents as a highly attractive candidate for repurposing in the treatment of sarcopenia due to several key strengths. Its well-defined mechanism of action—namely, the inhibition of PDE4 resulting in cAMP accumulation and subsequent activation of PKA leading to phospholamban phosphorylation—directly addresses a central defect in aged muscle physiology: impaired SERCA activity and suboptimal Ca2+ reuptake. This mechanism is supported by robust data from cardiac and smooth muscle studies (Beca et al., 2011; Kaneda et al., 2010), and the molecules involved are also present in skeletal muscle (Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). Additionally, rolipram’s oral bioavailability and the extensive pharmacokinetic and safety profiles already established in CNS and cardiovascular studies provide an advantageous starting point for rapid clinical translation. The compound also has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-proteolytic effects, which are highly relevant given that chronic inflammation and muscle protein breakdown are both significant contributors to sarcopenia pathology (Lira et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2020). Moreover, prior research in related conditions, such as COPD cachexia and sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction, further underscores the potential versatility of PDE4 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy (Barreiro et al., 2018; Ji et al., 2020).

However, there are also potential weaknesses and uncertainties that must be considered. The majority of existing mechanistic data for rolipram comes from studies on cardiac and vascular smooth muscle, with relatively little direct evidence regarding its effects on skeletal muscle aging or in models of sarcopenia. While the molecular pathways are conserved, there may be significant tissue-specific differences in PDE4 isoform expression, regulatory protein interactions, and compensation by other pathways that could affect the outcome in skeletal muscle. Additionally, rolipram has been associated with CNS side effects in previous trials due to its effects on neuronal cAMP signaling, posing potential challenges for tolerability in elderly patients if high doses are required (Crocetti et al., 2022). Furthermore, while increased cAMP and enhanced SERCA activity are generally beneficial for muscle function, the extent to which rolipram can restore calcium dynamics in the context of longstanding sarcopenia remains to be determined experimentally. There is also the possibility that the off-target effects observed in some studies may limit its long-term use in a chronic disease setting (Stathopoulou et al., 2019). Finally, while rolipram’s ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) profile has been characterized in other indications, pharmacodynamic studies specifically in aged skeletal muscle will be essential to validate dosing strategies and clinical endpoints.

In summary, rolipram offers a compelling, mechanism-based approach for the treatment of sarcopenia by leveraging its capacity to elevate cAMP and trigger PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PLN, thereby enhancing SERCA activity and improving Ca2+ reuptake kinetics. The candidate’s strengths include a well-documented biochemical mechanism, a favorable ADME profile supported by CNS and cardiovascular data, and established anti-inflammatory properties that may further benefit muscle preservation. The main weaknesses stem from the current lack of direct preclinical evidence in skeletal muscle or aging models and the potential for CNS-related side effects that will need to be addressed through careful dose titration or tissue-selective targeting strategies. Overall, rolipram represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia that merits further investigation in dedicated preclinical studies using aged skeletal muscle models and, subsequently, in early-phase clinical trials to confirm its efficacy and safety in an elderly population (Kaneda et al., 2010; Qaisar et al., 2020; Ray & Shibaguchi, 2021).

CDN1163 (CAS 1088261-38-9),"Proposal for CDN1163 (CAS 1088261-38-9)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
CDN1163 is a fully synthetic small-molecule compound identified as an allosteric activator of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase (SERCA) pump, specifically targeting the SERCA1 and SERCA2 isoforms known to be essential in skeletal muscle calcium handling (Qaisar et al., 2019). Discovered through high-throughput screening efforts in preclinical models of metabolic dysfunction and oxidative stress, CDN1163 is synthesized using organic chemistry methods that yield a molecule capable of penetrating cell membranes and selectively binding to SERCA (Qaisar et al., 2019). This compound belongs to a class of SERCA activators—small molecules designed to bind allosterically to the enzyme, thereby enhancing its Ca²⁺ affinity and ATPase activity, and ultimately improving the rate of calcium uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Qaisar et al., 2019). Members of this therapeutic class have previously been used in preclinical studies addressing muscle dysfunction and metabolic disorders, although their use in human clinical settings remains to be explored (Xu & Van Remmen, 2021).

Therapeutic History:
To date, the therapeutic history of CDN1163 is grounded entirely in rigorous preclinical evaluation. Extensive studies in animal models have demonstrated that SERCA activity is reduced in the context of muscle aging and oxidative stress, driving increased cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentrations and contributing to muscle atrophy and weakness (Paez et al., 2023). In models of oxidative stress-induced muscle impairment, such as the Sod1⁻/⁻ mouse, treatment with CDN1163 restored SERCA ATPase activity, reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, and rescued deficits in muscle mass and contractile force (Qaisar et al., 2019). Further extension of these findings in aged wild-type mice confirmed that chronic administration of CDN1163 prevents the decline in SERCA function typically observed during aging, leading to improved calcium homeostasis and muscle performance (Qaisar et al., 2020). Despite these promising preclinical outcomes, there are presently no clinical trials registered that test CDN1163 specifically for sarcopenia or muscle aging, which emphasizes that its current use is still confined to laboratory-based or animal model studies (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, CDN1163 functions by directly binding to SERCA, the enzyme responsible for re-uptake of Ca²⁺ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), thereby restoring effective Ca²⁺ cycling within the muscle cell (Qaisar et al., 2019). Under optimal conditions, SERCA activity is essential for promoting muscle relaxation following contraction by reducing cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentrations; however, in aged or diseased muscle, oxidative damage and altered expression of regulatory proteins impair SERCA function (Paez et al., 2023). CDN1163 is proposed to stabilize an active conformation of the SERCA pump, which increases its affinity for Ca²⁺ and enhances its ATPase activity, thereby accelerating the reuptake of Ca²⁺ into the SR (Qaisar et al., 2020; Li et al., 2025). This allosteric activation mechanism is particularly important because it does not merely upregulate SERCA expression but restores and augments the intrinsic enzymatic function of the existing protein, offering a more targeted approach than interventions such as antioxidants that broadly mitigate oxidative stress (Qaisar et al., 2019; Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). Moreover, by reducing the prolonged cytosolic calcium levels seen in aged muscle, CDN1163 indirectly decreases activation of Ca²⁺-dependent proteases and limits mitochondrial dysfunction—both critical contributors to muscle fatigue and atrophy in sarcopenia (Paez et al., 2023; Li et al., 2025).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis underlying the use of CDN1163 for sarcopenia is that by selectively binding and stabilizing SERCA1/2 ATPase in aged human myotubes, the drug will effectively boost the uptake of Ca²⁺ into the SR, thus normalizing intracellular Ca²⁺ levels, and restoring the amplitude and kinetics of Ca²⁺ transients that are typically impaired in sarcopenia (Qaisar et al., 2019; Paez et al., 2023). In the proposed assay, aged myotubes in vitro would be treated with CDN1163 to measure increases in SERCA ATPase activity, improved rate of calcium reuptake, reduction in the sustained elevated cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels, and normalization of muscle contraction–relaxation cycles. This is supported by preclinical evidence wherein CDN1163 treatment of aged or oxidative stress–modeled muscle resulted in enhanced contractile function and improved mitochondrial biogenesis markers, suggesting that muscle fibers restored to normative calcium dynamics exhibit enhanced force generation and endurance (Qaisar et al., 2019; Qaisar et al., 2020). The expected cellular outcome is a direct amelioration of the pathological prolonged Ca²⁺ transients exhibited by sarcopenic muscle, due to improved SERCA pump function. Additionally, since SERCA is known to be highly expressed in both fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers and plays a pivotal role in excitation–contraction coupling, its activation is expected to result in broad improvements in muscle fiber performance in the context of aging (Kanazawa et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025).

Overall Evaluation:
CDN1163 represents a compelling therapeutic candidate for the treatment of sarcopenia based on a robust preclinical rationale. Its primary strength lies in its mechanism of directly enhancing SERCA activity, which is a critical failure point in the pathogenesis of muscle aging. The preclinical studies conducted in Sod1⁻/⁻ mice and aged wild-type mouse models provide strong evidence that pharmacologically activating SERCA can restore calcium homeostasis, reduce oxidative stress, and importantly, improve muscle mass and contractile function (Qaisar et al., 2019; Qaisar et al., 2020). Additionally, the small-molecule nature of CDN1163 endows it with favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including cell permeability and low off-target effects, as demonstrated by its selectivity across a 160-target panel (Qaisar et al., 2019; Braun et al., 2021).

From a biochemical perspective, CDN1163’s well-defined mode of action—binding to and allosterically activating SERCA—provides a degree of mechanistic specificity that is often lacking in broader therapeutic approaches such as antioxidant supplementation (Qaisar et al., 2020; Li et al., 2025). Its action is particularly attractive because it directly addresses the known failure of Ca²⁺ reuptake seen in aged muscle, which underpins many of the downstream pathological effects including elevated cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels, increased protease activity, and mitochondrial dysfunction (Paez et al., 2023; Xu & Van Remmen, 2021).

However, there remain several weaknesses and gaps that need further exploration before CDN1163 can be confidently advanced as a therapeutic for sarcopenia. Firstly, while preclinical models have provided promising data, there is a complete absence of clinical trial evidence (ClinicalTrials.gov) indicating that the safety, optimal dosing, and long-term efficacy in humans are yet to be determined. Additionally, the detailed molecular interactions of CDN1163 with SERCA at the atomic level remain to be fully elucidated, which could be critical for optimizing its efficacy and reducing potential off-target effects (Li et al., 2025; Qaisar et al., 2019). Moreover, as the compound is primarily evaluated in animal models—specifically in mice with genetic and induced models of oxidative stress—the translatability of these findings to human physiology, particularly in the heterogeneous context of aging human muscle, must be validated with caution (Kanazawa et al., 2024; Paez et al., 2023).

The expected effect in human myotubes, as hypothesized, aligns well with the available biochemical and preclinical data, but additional studies involving human cell models and eventually early phase clinical trials will be necessary to confirm that the restoration of SERCA activity by CDN1163 similarly improves muscle function and calcium homeostasis in human sarcopenia (Qaisar et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2022). In terms of drug development, CDN1163 is appealing due to its druggable target—the SERCA pump—and the strong rationale provided by genetic studies that have implicated SERCA dysfunction in sarcopenia (Paez et al., 2023; Li et al., 2025). Its small-molecule nature also increases the likelihood of favorable pharmacokinetics and scalability in synthesis. Nonetheless, issues such as the potential for unforeseen adverse effects when systemically modulating calcium homeostasis, the precise impact on differing muscle fiber types, and the compound’s metabolic stability in humans all remain open questions, necessitating further in-depth investigation.

Overall, CDM1163 stands out as a promising drug candidate for repurposing in the treatment of sarcopenia. The strengths include a well-defined mechanism of action that directly targets a critical pathophysiological defect in aged muscle, robust preclinical data supporting its efficacy in restoring SERCA function and improving muscle performance, and the theoretical benefits of its small-molecule attributes, including cell permeability and specificity (Qaisar et al., 2019; Qaisar et al., 2020). On the other hand, the major weaknesses are the current lack of clinical trial data specifically in human sarcopenia, incomplete molecular characterization of its binding interactions, and the challenges inherent in translating preclinical animal data to diverse human populations (ClinicalTrials.gov; Qaisar et al., 2020).

In conclusion, based on the comprehensive literature review across biochemical, preclinical, and limited clinical data, CDN1163 demonstrates considerable promise as a therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia. Its ability to selectively activate SERCA, thereby restoring calcium homeostasis and improving muscle contractility, directly addresses the molecular defects associated with age-related muscle atrophy. While the preclinical evidence is compelling and the mechanistic rationale is strong, further studies—especially those involving human-derived cells and early-phase clinical trials—are essential to confirm its safety, optimal dosing, and translational efficacy in the context of sarcopenia. The strengths of this candidate make it worthy of continued development, whereas the weaknesses highlight the need for diligent translational research moving forward (Qaisar et al., 2019; Qaisar et al., 2020; Paez et al., 2023).

AVE-0991,"Proposal for AVE-0991

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
AVE-0991 is a fully synthetic small‐molecule compound that acts as a non-peptide agonist at the Mas receptor. It was initially developed to mimic the beneficial actions of the endogenous heptapeptide angiotensin‐(1–7) [Ang-(1–7)], a key component of the alternative, or “protective,” axis of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). Unlike peptide‐based drugs—which are often challenged by poor oral bioavailability and rapid proteolytic degradation—AVE-0991 was engineered to be orally active and resistant to enzymatic degradation. AVE-0991 belongs to a class of compounds that target G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), specifically those that mediate counterregulatory effects opposing the classical angiotensin II (Ang II)/AT₁ receptor axis. This class has been widely studied in the cardiovascular arena, where Mas receptor activation has been shown to mediate vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic effects, and it is increasingly being considered for applications in diseases characterized by tissue degeneration and oxidative stress. The discovery and synthesis of AVE-0991 involved iterative medicinal chemistry optimization to yield a molecule with the appropriate receptor affinity, oral pharmacokinetics, and tissue penetrance needed to activate the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas pathway effectively (Acuña et al., 2014; Murphy et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic candidate AVE-0991 and related non-peptide Mas receptor agonists have been primarily investigated in preclinical studies focused on cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, where activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis confers potent vasorelaxant, anti-fibrotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. In experimental rodent models, AVE-0991 has been shown to recapitulate many of the beneficial actions typically associated with Ang-(1–7) infusion, notably in terms of reducing adverse tissue remodeling and improving overall organ function (Latil et al., 2021; Yamamoto et al., 2020).
While the candidate has not yet been approved or broadly employed in clinical settings for sarcopenia, the preclinical evidence indicates that activation of the Mas receptor can improve skeletal muscle structure and function in disease models that share pathophysiological features with sarcopenia. For example, Ang-(1–7) treatment in mdx mice—a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy—has been shown to normalize muscle architecture, reduce fibrosis, and enhance muscle strength (Acuña et al., 2014). In cancer cachexia models, pharmacological activation of the Mas receptor with compounds analogous to AVE-0991 has led to improvements in whole-body metabolism, muscle mass preservation, and functional outcomes (Murphy et al., 2019). More recently, studies investigating the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas pathway in aging models have consistently demonstrated a decline in skeletal muscle function associated with reduced Ang-(1–7) signaling, along with evidence that activation of this axis in aged mice improves muscle performance (Huang et al., 2021; Takeshita et al., 2023). Although clinical data directly linking AVE-0991 to improved muscle outcomes in sarcopenia are currently sparse, the existing biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature supports repurposing this candidate for age-related muscle dysfunctions given its favorable preclinical profile in related disease models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, AVE-0991 is designed to bind selectively to the Mas receptor, a GPCR expressed on the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle fibers, vascular endothelial cells, and resident satellite cells. Activation of the Mas receptor initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling events that ultimately modulate gene transcription, protein synthesis, and ion channel function. One critical consequence of Mas receptor activation is the induction of nitric oxide (NO) production via the AKT-eNOS pathway, leading to vasodilation and improved microvascular perfusion in skeletal muscle, which is essential for effective nutrient and oxygen delivery (Yamamoto et al., 2020).

In the context of sarcopenia, where oxidative stress, chronic low-grade inflammation, and calcium handling abnormalities are seminal contributors to muscle wasting, AVE-0991’s receptor-mediated activation appears to have several beneficial intracellular effects. First, Mas receptor activation leads to inhibition of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, which is known to drive fibrosis and impair muscle regeneration. By suppressing TGF-β signaling, AVE-0991 may reduce fibrosis in aging muscle, thus preserving the structural integrity and functional capacity of myofibers (Acuña et al., 2014; Cabello‐Verrugio et al., 2015).

Second, a key aspect of AVE-0991’s mechanism is its role in reducing oxidative stress. Chronic overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) contributes to cellular damage and the dysfunction of essential proteins in muscle fibers. The activation of the Mas receptor by AVE-0991 initiates a redox-modulatory signaling cascade that counters ROS production and diminishes NF-κB activation, a central mediator of inflammation. This antioxidant effect is particularly relevant in aged skeletal muscle, where high ROS levels lead to damage of critical calcium-regulating proteins such as the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1). By preserving RyR1 conformation, AVE-0991 is hypothesized to lower sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca²⁺ leak, thereby maintaining proper Ca²⁺ transient amplitudes necessary for effective muscle contraction (Murphy et al., 2019; Takeshita et al., 2023).

Moreover, the improved Ca²⁺ handling and resultant fatigue resistance likely stem from a direct receptor-mediated redox reduction mechanism that helps to stabilize proteins involved in excitation–contraction coupling. Activation of the Mas receptor has been associated with enhanced mitochondrial function and a shift in muscle fiber type composition toward more glycolytic, fast-twitch fibers, which are more resistant to fatigue under conditions of stress (Karnik et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2019). Together, these molecular interactions underscore AVE-0991’s potential to ameliorate several deleterious processes characteristic of sarcopenia, including oxidative damage, inflammation, disrupted calcium homeostasis, and fibrosis.

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assays using aged myotubes, AVE-0991 is expected to produce several quantifiable benefits. Based on its mode of action through Mas receptor activation, the candidate is hypothesized to reduce oxidative stress markers, which can be measured via assays for reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and antioxidant enzyme expression. The normalization of redox state is predicted to preserve the conformation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR1), a critical calcium release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Preservation of RyR1 integrity is essential because, in aged muscle fibers, oxidative modifications often lead to an increased SR Ca²⁺ leak that can result in impaired Ca²⁺ transient amplitude during muscle contraction. Therefore, in a controlled assay, cells treated with AVE-0991 should exhibit a reduced SR Ca²⁺ leak as demonstrated by lower baseline Ca²⁺ release and improved Ca²⁺ transient parameters measured via fluorescence-based Ca²⁺ imaging techniques (Huang et al., 2021; Murphy et al., 2019).

Furthermore, it is anticipated that AVE-0991 will enhance fatigue resistance in aged myotubes by preserving normal Ca²⁺ signaling and contributing to efficient excitation–contraction coupling. Given that the Mas receptor is expressed in skeletal muscle, including in myotubes and satellite cells—cells essential for muscle regeneration—it is reasonable to expect that AVE-0991 will improve not only functional muscle contraction but also overall muscle fiber integrity (Sartiani et al., 2015; Takeshita et al., 2021). In addition, the improved redox balance and preserved SR Ca²⁺ handling are expected to support better cellular metabolism and insulin sensitivity via upregulation of glucose transporter (GLUT4) expression. This action is particularly beneficial in aged skeletal muscle, where insulin resistance is a frequent complication that contributes to reduced protein synthesis and muscle wasting (Huang et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021).

On a functional level, if AVE-0991 treatment results in a measurable improvement in Ca²⁺ transients—such as higher amplitude peaks and a reduced rate of decline—it would confirm that the compound is effectively preserving the integrity of key Ca²⁺ regulatory proteins. As a consequence, treated myotubes should be more resistant to fatigue under repetitive stimulation protocols commonly used in in vitro assays. Translationally, this could correlate with enhanced muscle strength and endurance seen in preclinical models of muscle aging and cachexia, where Mas receptor agonism has previously been linked to improved exercise performance and muscle force generation (Acuña et al., 2014; Murphy et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
AVE-0991 is a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment and prevention of sarcopenia due to its targeted activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas receptor axis. One of the primary strengths of AVE-0991 is its oral bioavailability and well-characterized pharmacokinetic profile in rodent models, which facilitates both preclinical testing and potential clinical translation (Latil et al., 2021; Murphy et al., 2019). Its receptor-mediated mechanism allows for a specific redox reduction effect that preserves critical proteins such as RyR1, thereby improving SR Ca²⁺ handling, enhancing Ca²⁺ transient amplitude, and increasing fatigue resistance—a constellation of effects particularly relevant in combating the muscle weakness observed in sarcopenia (Murphy et al., 2019; Takeshita et al., 2023).

Biochemically, the compound’s mechanism is well-supported by literature showing that Mas receptor activation counteracts the detrimental effects of excessive Ang II and its associated pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic signals. By inhibiting TGF-β/Smad signaling and reducing NF-κB activation, AVE-0991 is predicted to lower fibrosis and preserve muscle contractility in aged tissues (Acuña et al., 2014; Cabello‐Verrugio et al., 2015). This dual action—ameliorating oxidative stress and reducing fibrotic remodeling—is a particularly attractive therapeutic strategy given the multifactorial pathology of sarcopenia.

In terms of therapeutic history, although AVE-0991 itself has not yet been tested clinically for sarcopenia, its efficacy in related conditions such as muscular dystrophy and cancer cachexia indicates that the Mas receptor is a valid target for muscle preservation. Preclinical studies in these models have consistently demonstrated that activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis improves muscle function, reduces fibrosis, and enhances overall structural integrity of the muscle tissue (Acuña et al., 2014; Murphy et al., 2019). This literature provides a strong rationale for further evaluating AVE-0991 in sarcopenia models.

Nevertheless, there are certain weaknesses and gaps that must be acknowledged. First, while the proposed mechanism of action—preserving RyR1 conformation and limiting SR Ca²⁺ leak—is biologically plausible and supported by preclinical data in other muscle wasting contexts, direct experimental validation of these mechanisms specifically in the context of aging myotubes remains limited. In addition, while the Mas receptor is clearly expressed in skeletal muscle, further quantitative characterization of its expression levels and downstream signaling in aged human myotubes compared with animal models is needed to substantiate translational potential (Sartiani et al., 2015; Takeshita et al., 2021). Moreover, although improved fatigue resistance is anticipated, the extent to which AVE-0991 can reverse established sarcopenic muscle pathology versus merely preventing further deterioration must be rigorously tested.

Another potential challenge is the complex nature of sarcopenia, which, unlike monogenic muscle disorders, is a multifactorial condition influenced by hormonal changes, chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuromuscular alterations. As such, while AVE-0991’s mechanism addresses key factors such as oxidative stress and Ca²⁺ handling, it may need to be combined with other therapies or lifestyle interventions (e.g., exercise, nutritional optimization) to achieve maximal clinical benefit. Nonetheless, the fact that AVE-0991 acts through a well-defined receptor-mediated pathway offers the advantage of a targeted approach, reducing the likelihood of widespread off-target effects often seen with broader-acting agents.

In summary, AVE-0991 emerges as a strong candidate for further preclinical and eventually clinical evaluation in sarcopenia. Its strengths lie in its oral bioavailability, specific mechanism of Mas receptor activation leading to redox stabilization and improved calcium homeostasis, and a growing body of preclinical evidence indicating beneficial effects on muscle physiology. Weaknesses include the need for more direct data in aged myotubes and sarcopenia models as well as the inherent complexity of muscle aging as compared to other forms of muscle wasting. Given the comprehensive biochemical, translational, and mechanistic support from studies showing that activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas receptor axis improves muscle function (Acuña et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2021; Murphy et al., 2019; Sartiani et al., 2015; Takeshita et al., 2023), further investigation and validation of AVE-0991 in models of sarcopenia is warranted. The promising receptor-mediated redox reduction mechanism—specifically preserving Ca²⁺ channel integrity and improving Ca²⁺ transients—supports the translational feasibility of this approach. For these reasons, continued research into AVE-0991 is recommended, with particular emphasis on detailed in vitro assays using aged myotubes and rigorous in vivo models of sarcopenia to fully characterize its therapeutic potential and define optimal dosing strategies before moving into clinical trials.

Overall, the team should consider proceeding with additional mechanistic studies that evaluate not only the antioxidant and antifibrotic effects of AVE-0991 but also its impact on muscle contractility, satellite cell activation, and whole-body metabolic profile. Such comprehensive preclinical data will be critical to build a robust case for clinical evaluation in aging populations afflicted with sarcopenia (Murphy et al., 2019; Takeshita et al., 2023; Yamamoto et al., 2020).

SRT2104,"Proposal for SRT2104

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SRT2104 is a fully synthetic small‐molecule activator of SIRT1, a NAD⁺–dependent deacetylase enzyme that modulates many pathways associated with aging, metabolism, and inflammatory responses. This compound belongs to the class of sirtuin‐activating compounds (STACs), which have been designed as potent and selective pharmacological mimetics of caloric restriction. SRT2104 was discovered and optimized by Sirtris Pharmaceuticals (now part of GlaxoSmithKline) through high‐throughput screening and subsequent chemical modifications to improve oral bioavailability and selectivity relative to natural activators such as resveratrol. By design, STACs like SRT2104 were developed to be more druglike than early natural compounds; they offer improved pharmacokinetic profiles—with reasonable oral bioavailability, acceptable half‐life, and a safety profile established in multiple Phase I clinical trials—and the ability to activate SIRT1 at clinically relevant doses (Andreux et al., 2013; Hubbard & Sinclair, 2014; Chang et al., 2024). Moreover, SRT2104 is notable for its clear developmental pedigree: it has been studied not only in healthy volunteers but also in subjects with metabolic disorders and inflammatory conditions, thereby providing a rich preclinical and clinical evaluation background.

Therapeutic History:
SRT2104 has advanced considerably along the clinical development pathway. Early-phase clinical trials have evaluated this compound’s pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety in diverse human populations. In several Phase I studies—such as those registered under NCT00920660, NCT00937872, and NCT00938275—SRT2104 was administered to healthy adult volunteers both in fed and fasted states, and later in elderly populations (NCT00964340). These studies confirmed that SRT2104 is orally bioavailable, with peak plasma concentrations reached within approximately 1–3 hours; adverse events were generally mild (e.g., headache, gastrointestinal upset) and the safety profile was favorable across dose escalations up to 2.0 g daily (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008b; Libri et al., 2012; Mercken et al., 2014).
Furthermore, SRT2104 has been investigated in patients with type 2 diabetes (Baksi et al., 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2010a) and in inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2010b) and ulcerative colitis (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2012). In these clinical contexts, the compound demonstrated biochemical activity such as improved lipid profiles, reduction in inflammatory cytokines, and evidence of SIRT1 target engagement. Importantly for drug repurposing, none of the clinical studies thus far have specifically aimed at treating sarcopenia, yet the biochemical rationale providing indirect evidence from its use in metabolic and aging‐related conditions bolsters the hypothesis that SRT2104 may benefit muscle pathology. Preclinical studies have also indicated that SRT2104 can improve mitochondrial function in muscle tissue during conditions of stress such as disuse (Waltz et al., 2019; Wesolowski et al., 2023). Although direct application in sarcopenia models is still emerging, the wealth of clinical data on safety and pharmacokinetics gives SRT2104 a strong translational advantage for repurposing efforts in aged muscle disorder contexts.

Mechanism of Action:
At its core, SRT2104 functions by binding allosterically to SIRT1, thereby enhancing its deacetylase activity. SIRT1 deacetylates a wide range of substrates implicated in cellular stress responses and metabolic regulation, including transcription factors such as p53, FOXO family proteins, NF-κB, and coactivators such as PGC-1α. Activation of SIRT1 results in improved mitochondrial biogenesis and function via deacetylation and subsequent activation of PGC-1α, yielding increased expression of genes related to oxidative metabolism. This action underlies many of the systemic anti-inflammatory and metabolic benefits observed with SRT2104 (Andreux et al., 2013; Hubbard & Sinclair, 2014).

The novel hypothesis here postulates that SRT2104 may exert a direct impact on sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase isoforms—SERCA2a/2b—in aged myotubes by deacetylating them. In skeletal muscle, SERCA2 is critically involved in sequestering cytosolic Ca²⁺ back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) following contraction, ensuring effective muscle relaxation and refilling of Ca²⁺ stores. With aging, calcium handling tends to be impaired, and dysfunctional SERCA2 activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia by contributing to cytosolic Ca²⁺ overload and subsequent muscle weakness. While direct evidence from clinical trials showing SRT2104’s modulation of SERCA2 is not yet available, existing studies have demonstrated that SIRT1 activation can influence Ca²⁺ handling proteins, and related literature suggests that post-translational modifications such as acetylation can alter SERCA function (Guo et al., 2024; Hubbard & Sinclair, 2014). Thus, by deacetylating SERCA2, SRT2104 may restore proper SR Ca²⁺ uptake dynamics, normalize Ca²⁺ transient clearance, and ultimately mitigate the toxic effects of cytosolic Ca²⁺ overload in aged muscle fibers.

At the biochemical level, the binding of SRT2104 to SIRT1 stabilizes the enzyme’s conformation, lowering the Km for its acetylated substrates, which results in enhanced deacetylation reactions even at physiological NAD⁺ levels. This mechanism not only influences mitochondrial biogenesis but might also target specific muscle proteins such as SERCA2. The hypothesis that SIRT1 deacetylates and thereby modulates SERCA2 function is supported by recent mechanistic studies, suggesting that SIRT1 activation leads to protective modifications in intracellular calcium handling and may even improve energy efficiency in myocytes (Pardo & Boriek, 2011; Tonkin et al., 2012). Given that SERCA2 expression is maintained in skeletal muscle and its activity declines with age, improved regulation via deacetylation represents an attractive therapeutic target for sarcopenia (Pardo & Boriek, 2011; Tonkin et al., 2012).

Expected Effect:
The expected pharmacodynamic effect of SRT2104 in aged myotubes is multifaceted. By activating SIRT1, SRT2104 is anticipated to trigger deacetylation of SERCA2 isoforms, which should increase the activity of SERCA2, leading to accelerated SR Ca²⁺ uptake. Enhanced Ca²⁺ uptake into the SR would provide a more rapid clearance of cytosolic Ca²⁺ transients after muscle contraction, reducing the likelihood of cytosolic Ca²⁺ overload—a condition associated with impaired muscle relaxation, increased cellular stress, and eventual muscle atrophy. In this context, the improved calcium homeostasis would be expected to result in a concomitant enhancement in muscle contractile function and endurance, hallmark improvements that directly target the biochemical underpinnings of sarcopenic weakness (Chen et al., 2023; Mercken et al., 2014).

In addition, by enhancing SIRT1 activity, SRT2104 may also promote mitochondrial biogenesis and improve mitochondrial efficiency through activation of PGC-1α, which is well documented to support energy metabolism in skeletal muscle. The dual action—improving both calcium handling through potential deacetylation of SERCA2 and augmenting mitochondrial function—creates a promising therapeutic approach in sarcopenia, given the disease’s complex etiology which involves both metabolic insufficiency and poor Ca²⁺ regulation. The fact that SIRT1 is expressed in skeletal muscle and plays a central role in regulating muscle repair and adaptation to stress supports the rationale for using SRT2104 in this tissue type (Myers et al., 2019; Pardo & Boriek, 2011). Preclinical studies in animal models of muscle atrophy—for example, in hindlimb-unloaded rats—have shown that SIRT1 activators can preserve muscle mass and improve mitochondrial enzyme activities, which further underscores the expected beneficial effects in slowing or reversing sarcopenic decline (Waltz et al., 2019; Wesolowski et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, SRT2104 is a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in sarcopenia due to several notable strengths. First, its synthetic nature and optimized drug-like properties—such as oral bioavailability, predictable pharmacokinetics, and extensive safety data from multiple clinical trials in diverse populations—offer a strong translational advantage. Clinical studies have repeatedly confirmed that SRT2104 is well tolerated in both healthy and diseased subjects, which suggest that potential side effects are minimal and manageable (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2009c; Hubbard & Sinclair, 2014; Libri et al., 2012). Second, the historical use of SRT2104 in trials for metabolic and inflammatory conditions supports its role as a modulator of pathways that are also relevant in the aging muscle phenotype. The compound’s previously demonstrated capacity to improve lipid profiles, reduce inflammatory cytokines, and enhance mitochondrial biomarkers indirectly supports its potential efficacy in conditions like sarcopenia that involve similar pathophysiological processes (Baksi et al., 2014; Mercken et al., 2014).

On the mechanistic side, the activation of SIRT1 by SRT2104 is well established at the molecular level. There is substantial evidence that SIRT1 regulates pathways critical to muscle metabolism, including deacetylation of transcription factors that drive mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic adaptation. The hypothesis that SRT2104 may deacetylate SERCA2, thereby enhancing SR Ca²⁺ uptake and improving Ca²⁺ transient clearance, is mechanistically attractive even though direct evidence in muscle tissues is presently limited. If proven, this specific post-translational modification could present a distinct molecular advantage over more general antioxidant or anti-inflammatory interventions. The dual action of simultaneously improving mitochondrial function and calcium handling addresses two central etiological factors in sarcopenia—mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulated Ca²⁺ homeostasis (Guo et al., 2024; Hubbard & Sinclair, 2014).

However, several weaknesses remain. Despite promising preclinical data regarding SIRT1 activation and muscle function improvement, there is a lack of direct clinical or preclinical studies that specifically examine SERCA2 deacetylation by SRT2104 in aged muscle or sarcopenia models. Most clinical trials conducted so far with SRT2104 have focused on metabolic diseases, psoriasis, inflammation, or type 2 diabetes, with no dedicated evaluation of muscle-specific endpoints such as force production, endurance, or direct measurements of calcium handling (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; Chang et al., 2024). This gap in the research leaves uncertainty regarding the precise magnitude of the effect on SERCA2 and subsequent improvements in muscle function. Furthermore, while the broad mechanism of SIRT1 activation is well documented, the specificity of SRT2104’s action on muscle proteins and the optimal dosing regimen to achieve the proposed SERCA2 deacetylation in muscle cells remain to be determined. Variability in pharmacokinetics noted in some clinical trials may also present challenges in reaching consistent therapeutic exposures in older patients with sarcopenia (Baksi et al., 2014; Libri et al., 2012).

Another consideration is the complexity of sarcopenia as a multifactorial disease. Sarcopenia involves not only deficits in muscle mass and mitochondrial function but also impaired satellite cell activity, increased inflammatory milieu, and systemic hormonal alterations. Thus, while improving Ca²⁺ handling via SERCA2 modulation is attractive, the overall clinical benefit may require combination strategies or targeting additional surrogate markers to achieve significant functional improvements.

In conclusion, SRT2104 presents a strong candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic for sarcopenia due to its well-established pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, its potent activation of SIRT1, and the plausible mechanistic connections between SIRT1 activation, improved mitochondrial function, and potential enhancement of SERCA2 activity. These factors collectively support the hypothesis that SRT2104 could accelerate SR Ca²⁺ uptake and improve calcium transient clearance, thereby mitigating cytosolic Ca²⁺ overload—a key driver of sarcopenic weakness (Mercken et al., 2014; Radak et al., 2020; Tonkin et al., 2012). Nonetheless, the lack of direct evidence linking SRT2104 to SERCA2 deacetylation in muscle remains a critical gap that must be addressed with focused preclinical studies and eventually, targeted clinical trials in sarcopenic populations. Across all considerations, the strengths lie in SRT2104’s translational readiness and broad mechanism of action, whereas the weaknesses center on the need for more muscle-specific mechanistic validation and clinical efficacy data in sarcopenia. Overall, SRT2104 shows considerable promise and warrants further investigation in dedicated preclinical models of muscle aging and ultimately in clinical trials evaluating functional muscle endpoints in the elderly.

Myricetin (Sigma-Aldrich M-7379),"Proposal for Myricetin (Sigma-Aldrich M-7379)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Myricetin is a naturally occurring flavonoid, originally isolated from various fruits, vegetables, and medicinal plants, and available commercially (Sigma-Aldrich M-7379). As a member of the flavonoid subclass, myricetin shares structural and functional characteristics with other polyphenolic compounds that have long been investigated for their antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties. Flavonoids as a class have been utilized for a range of biomedical applications due to their ability to penetrate cells, modulate signaling pathways, and mitigate oxidative stress. The compound's natural origin means that historical safety data is relatively abundant. The flavonoid scaffold of myricetin enhances cell permeability as well as allows for modifications to improve its pharmacokinetic profiles. Previous studies using cell‐based, animal, and biochemical models have shown that flavonoids can positively affect muscle physiology through antioxidant properties and by modulating mitochondrial function, making them attractive candidates for repurposing in muscle wasting conditions such as sarcopenia (Shen et al., 2019; Nikawa et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, flavonoids have been associated with numerous therapeutic indications and have been studied in various contexts, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory diseases. Within the scope of muscle health, several flavonoids – such as quercetin, epicatechin, and resveratrol – have been shown in preclinical models to alleviate muscle atrophy, improve mitochondrial biogenesis, and enhance contractile performance. Although myricetin itself has not been extensively documented in clinical trials for sarcopenia specifically, its structural class has demonstrated benefits in related muscle aging contexts. Clinical trial searches using the terms “Myricetin OR RyR1 OR flavonoid AND sarcopenia” have returned 21 relevant studies, indicating that research is active in exploring flavonoids or RyR1 modulators in the context of muscle degeneration and aging (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, related studies on natural constituents have reported that compounds similar to myricetin can enhance mitochondrial function and endurance, as seen with other flavonoids in animal models (Shen et al., 2019; Nikawa et al., 2021). This existing body of work lends indirect support to repurposing myricetin for sarcopenia, especially considering its favorable safety profile and bioavailability enhancements achieved with novel formulations (Shen et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
Recent high-throughput FRET screening experiments have identified myricetin as a molecule capable of modulating the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) in skeletal muscle. RyR1 is the critical calcium (Ca2+) release channel within the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), essential for excitation–contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal myofibers. In aged muscle, RyR1 dysfunction frequently manifests as pathological Ca2+ leak from the SR, leading to reduced Ca2+ transient amplitude and impaired muscle contractility. Detailed mechanistic work by Rebbeck et al. (2020) has demonstrated that myricetin increases fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency in assays measuring calmodulin (CaM) binding to RyR1, suggesting that the flavonoid stabilizes a conformation of the receptor more favorable for CaM interaction (Rebbeck et al., 2020). Functionally, myricetin was shown to reduce pathological SR Ca2+ leak in mechanically skinned human skeletal muscle fibers, an effect correlated with decreased [3H]ryanodine binding in functional receptor assays (Rebbeck et al., 2020). This inhibitory effect on RyR1 appears to be dose dependent, with low micromolar concentrations of myricetin diminishing aberrant Ca2+ leak while sparing or even modestly modulating normal EC coupling under physiological conditions (Rebbeck et al., 2020). The specificity of myricetin for the skeletal muscle isoform (RyR1) over the cardiac isoform (RyR2) is particularly promising, as it minimizes risks of adverse off-target cardiac effects. The biochemical mechanism appears to be mediated by an allosteric modulation whereby myricetin enhances calmodulin binding to RyR1, thereby suppressing the pathological open state of the channel without interfering significantly with fundamental regulatory interactions, such as those involving FKBP12 (Rebbeck et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
Based on the current mechanistic understanding, the expected effect of myricetin in aged human myotubes is the reduction of pathological SR Ca2+ leak through improved stabilization of RyR1 by calmodulin. This should, in turn, restore or amplify stimulus-evoked Ca2+ transient amplitude and ultimately boost contractile force – a significant clinical endpoint in the treatment of sarcopenia. In skeletal muscle, RyR1 is robustly expressed and functionally crucial for efficient calcium mobilization during muscle contraction (and its dysregulation is well-documented in the pathophysiology of sarcopenia). The hypothesis posits that myricetin, through its direct interaction with RyR1, allosterically enhances CaM binding, thus normalizing Ca2+ homeostasis in aged myotubes. With reduced SR Ca2+ leak, myricetin-treated muscle fibers should exhibit improved calcium transient amplitude upon electrical stimulation, resulting in increased contractile force (Rebbeck et al., 2020). Importantly, this mechanism is distinct from the generic antioxidant effects seen with many flavonoids, as it directly targets a critical muscle excitation–contraction pathway; this is supported by studies showing that similar compounds, such as quercetin, have had beneficial effects on muscle performance via multiple pathways, further reinforcing the potential effectiveness of myricetin’s RyR1-targeted mechanism (Nikawa et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, myricetin emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of sarcopenia based on a strong mechanistic rationale and supportive preclinical data. One significant strength is its demonstrated ability to stabilize RyR1 conformations in a manner that reduces pathological Ca2+ leak – a key pathological feature in aged muscle that contributes to decreased contractile performance. The specificity of its action, favoring RyR1 without significantly affecting RyR2, is particularly advantageous given the need to avoid adverse cardiac effects. The flavonoid's naturally derived scaffold, which has been associated with favorable cell penetration and modifiable pharmacokinetics, further supports its potential repurposing. Additionally, high-throughput FRET-based screening and functional assays in mechanically skinned human muscle fibers have provided direct evidence of its efficacy in modulating key components of the excitation–contraction machinery (Rebbeck et al., 2020).

However, several challenges remain that must be addressed. First, while preclinical models have provided promising proof-of-concept data, there is a significant gap in clinical data regarding myricetin's effectiveness in sarcopenia. ClinicalTrials.gov searches indicate that although related compounds and pathways are under investigation, there is no dedicated clinical trial evaluating myricetin in sarcopenia specifically (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Second, the exact pharmacokinetic profile of myricetin in human muscle tissue remains inadequately characterized, bringing some uncertainty to its potential systemic efficacy when repurposed for long-term treatment of muscle degeneration. The compound’s metabolism and bioavailability improvements have been addressed in preclinical formulations, but direct clinical translations of these modifications need further validation (Shen et al., 2019). Lastly, while mechanistic studies support its role in modulating RyR1 and CaM binding, additional research is warranted to investigate whether these in vitro effects translate to significant functional improvements in contractile force and muscle strength in aged human subjects—a critical endpoint for any sarcopenia therapy.

Overall, myricetin leverages a unique mechanism of action that directly addresses an underlying pathophysiological process in muscle aging—the pathological SR Ca2+ leak through RyR1. The data support that by enhancing calmodulin binding, myricetin can stabilize RyR1 function, thereby potentially restoring proper calcium handling and improving muscle contractile performance. Its natural flavonoid nature, existing safety profile, and ability to penetrate cells make it an attractive repurposed candidate for sarcopenia. However, further detailed pharmacokinetic studies, alongside dedicated clinical trials, are required to establish its efficacy and safety in the context of age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction. These future studies should focus on quantifying improvements in calcium transient amplitude, contractile force, and overall muscle performance in aged myotubes and human subjects. Considering both its mechanistic promise and the current gaps in clinical translation, myricetin stands out as a scientifically rational candidate that merits further investigation. Additional comprehensive research could pave the way for its repurposing as a novel therapeutic agent to counteract sarcopenia, addressing a critical unmet need in an aging population (Rebbeck et al., 2020; Nikawa et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Infliximab,"Proposal for Infliximab

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody developed to neutralize tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine. This protein‐based therapeutic is produced by combining the variable regions derived from a murine antibody with the constant region of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), thereby creating a molecule that is less immunogenic in humans compared with a wholly murine antibody while retaining high affinity for TNF-α. As an anti-TNF agent, infliximab belongs to a class of biologics that have been designed to inhibit the activity of TNF-α by binding both its soluble and membrane-bound forms. Historically, these agents have been widely used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriasis due to their ability to dampen exaggerated immune responses (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b). The synthesis and subsequent clinical development of infliximab followed the paradigm of using targeted immunotherapy to intercept key inflammatory mediators, and its established pharmacokinetic profile – including a half-life of approximately 7–12 days – has contributed to its integration into therapeutic regimens for inflammatory conditions (Stratos et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Infliximab has an extensive therapeutic history in both clinical and preclinical settings. Biochemically, it has been shown to neutralize TNF-α and thereby reduce a spectrum of downstream inflammatory processes in chronic inflammatory diseases. Clinically, infliximab has proven effective in diseases characterized by high TNF-α levels, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, where its administration has led to decreased symptoms, markers of inflammation, and notable improvements in patient quality of life (Subramaniam et al., 2015). In the context of muscle-wasting conditions, there is evidence – particularly in Crohn’s disease patients – where infliximab reversed inflammatory muscle wasting (sarcopenia) by increasing muscle volume and strength. For example, clinical studies have employed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate that infliximab increased quadriceps muscle volume and improved maximal contraction strength in Crohn’s disease, thus suggesting a reversal of inflammatory sarcopenia (Subramaniam et al., 2015). Despite these promising findings in inflammatory settings, clinical trial data dedicated solely to primary sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) are lacking, and searches for “Infliximab AND sarcopenia” in clinical trial databases have so far yielded no dedicated studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Nonetheless, the repurposing of infliximab for sarcopenia is supported by its mechanism of action and substantial safety data gleaned from its established use in chronic inflammatory disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b).

Mechanism of Action:
The known mechanism of action of infliximab centers on its ability to specifically bind TNF-α, preventing this cytokine from interacting with its cell-surface receptors—TNFR1 and TNFR2 – and thereby attenuating the ensuing pro-inflammatory cascade. Binding of TNF-α to its receptors normally triggers a variety of intracellular signaling cascades, including the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). In skeletal muscle, NF-κB activation is one of the key pathways leading to muscle protein degradation, inhibition of myogenesis, and promotion of catabolic genes such as atrogin-1 and MuRF1. By neutralizing TNF-α, infliximab prevents NF-κB activation, thereby interrupting this cascade (Dirks & Leeuwenburgh, 2006). Furthermore, increased chronic levels of TNF-α have been associated with aberrant Ca²⁺ signaling in muscle fibers. Specifically, pro-inflammatory signaling may lead to hyperactivation of kinases like Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and subsequent dysregulation of key calcium-handling proteins such as the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase (SERCA). Dysregulation of these proteins contributes to impaired calcium transient amplitude and kinetics, which ultimately compromises excitation–contraction coupling and muscle function. Infliximab, by reducing TNF-α levels, is hypothesized to mitigate the kinase cascades that disrupt normal CaMKII, RyR1, and SERCA function (Antuña et al., 2022). Preclinical studies also indicate that anti-TNF-α therapies modulate the NF-κB pathway in muscle tissues; for example, infliximab treatment in dystrophic mouse models has been associated with reductions in NF-κB subunit translocation and protection of type II muscle fibers, which are essential for rapid contraction and are prevalently affected in conditions involving muscle wasting (Stratos et al., 2022). Thus, the molecular interactions – through binding TNF-α, inhibiting NF-κB signaling, and potentially normalizing Ca²⁺ signaling – provide a comprehensive rationale for the repurposed use of infliximab in targeting the multifactorial pathology of sarcopenia.

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay, infliximab is expected to exert a multifaceted therapeutic effect on aged muscle. By neutralizing chronic low-grade TNF-α, infliximab should prevent the cytokine-induced activation of NF-κB, a key transcriptional regulator of muscle catabolism. It is anticipated that with reduced NF-κB signaling, the expression of muscle atrophy-promoting genes will decrease, thereby favoring a shift toward muscle protein synthesis and regeneration rather than degradation (Dhaliwal et al., 2021). Additionally, by intercepting the kinase cascades initiated by TNF-α – notably those involving CaMKII – infliximab is expected to stabilize the function of RyR1 and SERCA. This would result in an improvement in the amplitude and kinetics of Ca²⁺ transients in muscle fibers, which are critical for efficient excitation–contraction coupling. Sufficient evidence indicates that TNF-α is implicated in impairing muscle Ca²⁺ handling; thus, its neutralization might restore normal calcium signaling and subsequently enhance muscle contractility and strength (Subramaniam et al., 2015). In experimental settings, the restoration of muscle force has been observed in animal models following TNF-α blockade. For instance, in rat models of traumatic muscle injury, administration of infliximab led to improved muscle force recovery, reduced apoptosis, and enhanced preservation of muscle architecture, as shown by increased myofiber diameters and reduced inflammatory infiltrates (Stratos et al., 2022). Although these studies were conducted in the context of acute muscle injury rather than age-related sarcopenia, the underlying pathological mechanisms involving TNF-α and NF-κB appear to be shared, suggesting that the outcomes of normalizing Ca²⁺ transient dynamics and attenuating cytokine-driven catabolic pathways will be beneficial in sarcopenic muscle as well. Moreover, infliximab’s demonstrated ability to increase muscle volume in patients with inflammatory bowel disease provides additional support for its potential to counteract muscle wasting and improve functional outcomes in sarcopenia through the rebalancing of excitation–contraction coupling (Subramaniam et al., 2015).

Overall Evaluation:
Infliximab emerges as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia based on its extensive clinical use in chronic inflammatory diseases, its well-characterized pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, and its robust mechanism of action targeting TNF-α-driven inflammatory pathways. One significant strength of infliximab is its established history with proven human pharmacokinetics and tolerability over years of clinical use in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease (Subramaniam et al., 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b). Its ability to penetrate muscle tissue – demonstrated indirectly in studies on inflammatory myopathies and muscle wasting in Crohn’s disease – further supports its candidacy for treating sarcopenia. The mechanism by which infliximab neutralizes TNF-α has considerable therapeutic relevance; by suppressing TNF-α, the drug prevents the chronic activation of the NF-κB pathway, thereby reducing the expression of muscle atrophy-related genes. Aside from reducing protein degradation, the expected normalization of Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and kinetics through improved regulation of RyR1 and SERCA suggests that infliximab could restore proper excitation–contraction coupling and enhance muscle strength in aged individuals (Antuña et al., 2022; Stratos et al., 2022).

However, several weaknesses also need to be carefully considered. Despite compelling preclinical evidence and indirect clinical data from inflammatory conditions with muscle wasting components, there is currently a lack of direct clinical trials assessing the efficacy of infliximab for primary sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Furthermore, studies in dystrophic muscle models have indicated that TNF-α blockade can have complex effects; while low doses of TNF blockers may improve skeletal muscle strength and reduce fibrosis, higher doses risk adversely affecting cardiac function due to off-target impacts on growth signaling and compensatory hypertrophy (Ermolova et al., 2014). In addition, the dual role of TNF-α in muscle physiology – where it may contribute to both muscle repair and muscle degradation depending on context and concentration – demands a careful titration of therapeutic dosing to achieve beneficial effects without inadvertently impairing physiological regeneration processes (Mourkioti & Rosenthal, 2008). Finally, while the proposed mechanism involving normalization of CaMKII/NF-κB-mediated dysregulation of RyR1 and SERCA is plausible and supported by biochemical insights, direct evidence linking infliximab to improved Ca²⁺ signaling kinetics in aged or sarcopenic muscle remains to be fully elucidated, and further mechanistic studies would be warranted (Dhaliwal et al., 2021).

In summary, infliximab offers a robust biochemical and clinical rationale for repurposing as a therapy for sarcopenia. Its ability to neutralize chronic TNF-α, thereby suppressing the downstream NF-κB-driven catabolic pathways as well as potentially normalizing aberrant Ca²⁺ signaling via reduced CaMKII activity, positions it as a viable candidate. The strengths of existing safety data, proven efficacy in inflammatory conditions, and mechanistic plausibility are tempered by the need for dedicated clinical trials in sarcopenia populations, careful dosing strategies to avoid adverse cardiac effects, and further clarification of its impact on muscle calcium handling. Overall, while challenges remain, the preclinical and clinical literature reviewed supports infliximab as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for further investigation in the treatment of sarcopenia (Subramaniam et al., 2015; Stratos et al., 2022; Antuña et al., 2022).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Rosiglitazone is a fully synthetic small molecule that belongs to the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of drugs and acts as an agonist for the peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). This molecular entity was developed through a systematic program of medicinal chemistry that sought to improve insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The design and synthesis of rosiglitazone involved iterative chemical modifications of the TZD scaffold to yield a compound with high receptor affinity, favorable pharmacokinetics, and robust tissue distribution profiles. Its chemical synthesis was rooted in the exploitation of structure–activity relationships that allowed researchers to identify key functional groups needed for optimal receptor engagement, leading to the activation of PPARγ and thereby modulating the transcription of genes implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism (Cheng et al., 2019). As a member of the TZD class, rosiglitazone is part of a drug family historically intended for metabolic reprogramming; these agents have been utilized since the 1990s to improve glycemic control by enhancing insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, liver, and to some extent in skeletal muscle. Today, the class is well known not only for its antidiabetic properties but also for its pleiotropic effects on inflammatory markers and lipid profiles. Researchers are increasingly interested in repurposing such agents to target conditions like sarcopenia, where metabolic dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, and oxidative stress converge to impair skeletal muscle function (Cheng et al., 2019; Gross & Staels, 2007).

Therapeutic History
Clinically, rosiglitazone has been extensively used as an antidiabetic agent, with a long history of trials in patients with T2DM and metabolic syndrome. Its primary clinical indication has been to ameliorate insulin resistance, lower fasting blood glucose, and improve overall glycemic control. Over the past two decades, multiple large-scale clinical studies and randomized controlled trials have validated its efficacy in controlling hyperglycemia and modifying detrimental adipocytokine secretion patterns, including elevated levels of adiponectin that contribute to enhanced insulin sensitivity (Cheng et al., 2019; Wu & Tien, 2020). In addition to its success in metabolic endpoints, rosiglitazone has been carefully evaluated in secondary clinical applications, including cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic populations and exploratory studies in inflammatory conditions and even neurodegenerative diseases (Cheng et al., 2019). Despite these robust data, its use in indications related to muscle wasting disorders or sarcopenia has been limited. Searches conducted on ClinicalTrials.gov for “Rosiglitazone AND (sarcopenia OR muscle wasting OR skeletal muscle)” indicate only a handful of studies that inspect muscle function as secondary metabolic outcomes, rather than targeting primary measures of muscle mass or performance (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical investigations have sometimes included endpoints such as mitochondrial function and oxidative stress markers in skeletal muscle tissue; however, the specific use of rosiglitazone in preventing or reversing muscle wasting remains an unproven application. Particularly, while some small-scale studies have noted modifications in muscle metabolite profiles and indirect benefits when combined with interventions like resistance training, the overall clinical evidence for its use in sarcopenia is scarce and often inconclusive (Cetrone et al., 2014; Ma & Chen, 2021). Nevertheless, the established pharmacokinetic profile, widespread clinical experience in diabetes, and known capacity to modulate metabolic transcriptional programs represent compelling reasons to consider rosiglitazone for new therapeutic indications such as sarcopenia (Cheng et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action
At its core, rosiglitazone operates by binding to and activating PPARγ, a nuclear hormone receptor that functions as a transcription factor. Once rosiglitazone occupies the ligand-binding pocket of PPARγ, the receptor undergoes a conformational change that facilitates heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). This heterodimer then binds to specific peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. The ensuing alteration in gene transcription leads to changes in the expression of numerous proteins that regulate fatty acid uptake, adipogenesis, and glucose metabolism (Cheng et al., 2019; Gross & Staels, 2007).

Molecularly, the activation of PPARγ by rosiglitazone results in upregulation of insulin-sensitizing proteins such as adiponectin. In adipose tissue, this results in a more favorable metabolic profile, but in skeletal muscle, the transcriptional effects extend to the promotion of genes that are critical for mitochondrial biogenesis. One important aspect of this is the stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. Activation of AMPK, a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, can upregulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). PGC-1α is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis that promotes the transcription of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production (Coletta et al., 2009). In studies involving PPARγ agonists, increased mitochondrial biogenesis is associated with enhanced ATP generation and reduced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in skeletal muscle cells. This effect is particularly useful in the context of aging muscle, where mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress are key contributors to the development of sarcopenia.

Moreover, rosiglitazone has been shown to affect the differentiation potential of muscle satellite cells, the progenitor cells responsible for regenerative responses in skeletal muscle. In vitro investigations have demonstrated that rosiglitazone can modify the adipogenic differentiation of these satellite cells. Specifically, while satellite cells possess the potential to differentiate not only into myocytes but also into adipocytes, treatment with rosiglitazone has been shown to favor a balance that potentially reduces the ectopic intramuscular fat deposition commonly observed in aged, sarcopenic muscle tissue (De Coppi et al., 2006). By reducing the propensity for adipogenic conversion, rosiglitazone may help maintain the regenerative capacity and contractile function of skeletal muscle fibers.

In addition to its well-characterized transcriptional activities, rosiglitazone’s effects on skeletal muscle may also be attributed to its indirect actions on cellular oxidative stress. ROS overproduction in mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to oxidative post-translational modifications (PTMs) of key proteins such as the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) and the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase (SERCA). Such modifications impair the proteins’ functions and disrupt the delicate balance of Ca²⁺ handling critical for muscle contraction and relaxation. Therefore, by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and boosting the cellular antioxidant defenses (in part through the upregulation of genes involved in fat oxidation and ROS mitigation), rosiglitazone is hypothesized to help prevent these deleterious modifications (Ma & Chen, 2021; Witham et al., 2023). This preservation of the integrity of Ca²⁺ handling proteins, combined with improved energy metabolism, is central to the proposed mechanism for rescuing impaired muscle contraction in the ageing population.

It is also noteworthy that rosiglitazone may exert anti-inflammatory effects by dampening the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which are implicated in muscle catabolism. Chronic low-grade inflammation or “inflammaging” is a central feature of sarcopenia, and by mitigating this inflammatory milieu, rosiglitazone could further support muscle integrity and function (Cetrone et al., 2014; Wu & Tien, 2020). Thus, the comprehensive mechanism of action of rosiglitazone involves a multifaceted interplay between transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes, enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis through AMPK–PGC-1α signaling, modulation of satellite cell differentiation, reduction of ROS, and a dampening of chronic inflammatory processes.

Expected Effect
The core hypothesis for repurposing rosiglitazone in the treatment of sarcopenia is predicated on the expectation that activation of PPARγ will lead to metabolic reprogramming that benefits aged skeletal muscle. In preclinical models of aged myotubes, treatment with rosiglitazone is anticipated to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby increasing the oxidative capacity of the muscle cells. An increase in mitochondrial content is expected to lead to higher ATP levels and a concomitant reduction in the generation of ROS due to a more efficient electron transport chain function and improved coupling efficiency (Ma & Chen, 2021; Witham et al., 2023).

This improved mitochondrial function is hypothesized to lower the oxidative stress burden within muscle cells. A reduction in ROS levels, in turn, should decrease the incidence of oxidative PTMs on Ca²⁺ handling proteins, specifically RyR1 and SERCA. These proteins are critical for the proper excitation–contraction coupling of muscle fibers: RyR1 functions as a major Ca²⁺ release channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, while SERCA is responsible for Ca²⁺ reuptake and muscle relaxation. Oxidative modification of these proteins can lead to aberrant Ca²⁺ transients characterized by reduced amplitude and dysregulated kinetics, ultimately contributing to muscle weakness and impaired contractility. Therefore, by preserving the redox status and structural integrity of RyR1 and SERCA, rosiglitazone is expected to restore more youthful Ca²⁺ transient profiles in aged myotubes (Wu & Tien, 2020; Witham et al., 2023).

Beyond its direct effects on mitochondria and Ca²⁺ handling, rosiglitazone is also anticipated to have a favorable impact on muscle tissue composition through its action on satellite cells. Satellite cells are essential for muscle regeneration and repair. In vitro studies suggest that rosiglitazone can alter the differentiation trajectory of these cells by reducing their adipogenic potential, which may help limit the intramuscular fat infiltration (also known as myosteatosis) that is often observed in elderly individuals with sarcopenia (De Coppi et al., 2006). In this way, rosiglitazone could contribute to a muscle environment that favors myogenesis over adipogenesis, supporting the overall regenerative capacity and contractile function of the tissue.

Furthermore, the anticipated metabolic improvements extend to enhanced insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. Improved glucose uptake, mediated by increased expression and translocation of GLUT4 transporters in muscle fibers, would facilitate better energy utilization, which is critical for the repair and maintenance of muscle tissue. Insulin resistance is closely associated with aging and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia; thus, ameliorating insulin resistance may further support muscle health and function (Zhang et al., 2021; Ma & Chen, 2021).

Collectively, the expected effect of rosiglitazone in an in vitro model of aged myotubes is multifold:
1. Enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis leading to improved ATP production and reduced ROS production.
2. Reduction of oxidative stress that prevents deleterious modifications on key Ca²⁺ handling proteins (RyR1 and SERCA), thereby restoring normal Ca²⁺ transient kinetics and amplitude essential for muscle contraction.
3. Modulation of muscle satellite cell differentiation to reduce intramuscular fat deposition and promote effective myogenesis.
4. Improved insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, leading to better glucose uptake and overall metabolic function.
These effects are expected to culminate in the restoration of muscle function and contractile strength, offering a potential therapeutic avenue for mitigating the impacts of sarcopenia (Witham et al., 2023; Ma & Chen, 2021; Wu & Tien, 2020).

Overall Evaluation
Rosiglitazone presents an intriguing and multifaceted candidate for repurposing as a treatment for sarcopenia. The extensive clinical use of rosiglitazone in T2DM has endowed the drug with a well-characterized safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profile. This robust clinical history supports the feasibility of repurposing efforts, particularly in a population where metabolic derangements often coexist with muscle wasting. The drug’s proven capacity to activate PPARγ and subsequently modulate gene transcription that enhances insulin sensitivity and promotes favorable lipid metabolism offers a solid rationale for its application in skeletal muscle disorders (Cheng et al., 2019; Gross & Staels, 2007).

One of the strongest aspects of rosiglitazone’s potential in sarcopenia is its documented ability to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis through mechanisms that involve AMPK and PGC-1α signaling. Given that mitochondrial dysfunction is a central feature of aging skeletal muscle, the ability to boost mitochondrial function could translate into significant metabolic improvements in muscle fibers. In addition, reducing ROS production through enhanced mitochondrial efficiency may play a critical role in preventing oxidative damage to Ca²⁺ handling proteins, a pathophysiological process implicated in age-related declines in muscle contractility (Coletta et al., 2009; Ma & Chen, 2021).

Furthermore, preclinical studies have provided evidence that rosiglitazone can modulate the differentiation potential of muscle satellite cells, potentially limiting the ectopic fat deposition that is frequently associated with aging muscle and contributes to functional decline. Such modulation would not only preserve muscle fiber integrity but also support regenerative processes critical for maintaining muscle mass in the elderly (De Coppi et al., 2006).

Nonetheless, significant weaknesses and challenges complicate the potential repurposing of rosiglitazone for sarcopenia. In contrast to its well-established metabolic effects, there is a notable scarcity of robust clinical data demonstrating direct improvements in muscle mass, strength, or functional performance in patients with sarcopenia. Most of the available studies have focused on metabolic endpoints rather than primary outcomes related to skeletal muscle performance (Cheng et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This gap in the literature means that the proposed mechanism—particularly the prevention of oxidative modifications on RyR1 and SERCA leading to normalized Ca²⁺ handling—remains largely theoretical and requires extensive validation in both preclinical and clinical settings.

Moreover, the safety profile of rosiglitazone, while well documented in diabetic populations, raises concerns for its application in the elderly—the primary population affected by sarcopenia. Adverse effects such as weight gain, fluid retention, and an increased risk of heart failure have been repeatedly reported, and these may pose significant risks in older patients who often have additional cardiovascular comorbidities (Gross & Staels, 2007; Cheng et al., 2019). Balancing the potential metabolic and mitochondrial benefits against the risk of such side effects is a major consideration when contemplating the use of rosiglitazone in treating sarcopenia.

There is also some inconsistency in the available results from studies examining thiazolidinediones in muscle-related outcomes. While some investigations have demonstrated improvements in biomarkers of mitochondrial function and reduced intramyocellular lipid deposition, others have not shown significant enhancements in clinical measures of muscle mass or strength. For instance, studies have noted that pioglitazone, a closely related TZD, can lead to improvements in mitochondrial gene expression and oxidative metabolism without necessarily producing a measurable increase in muscle mass or performance, particularly when used as a monotherapy (Witham et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2021). These mixed outcomes highlight the need for well-designed, targeted studies to confirm whether the biochemical and cellular effects of rosiglitazone can translate into meaningful clinical benefits that address the core deficits seen in sarcopenia.

Additionally, the specific hypothesis that rosiglitazone’s activation of PPARγ will ultimately rescue Ca²⁺ handling defects by protecting RyR1 and SERCA from oxidative damage is novel and attractive from a mechanistic standpoint. Yet, the current chain of evidence linking PPARγ activation through rosiglitazone to improvements in Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and kinetics remains indirect. Direct demonstration of improved excitation–contraction coupling in aged muscle fibers following rosiglitazone treatment has yet to be rigorously established in either preclinical models or human studies (Wu & Tien, 2020; Ma & Chen, 2021).

In summary, rosiglitazone stands as an attractive candidate for repurposing in the treatment of sarcopenia due to its well-documented metabolic actions, capacity to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis, and potential to reduce oxidative stress in muscle cells. Its long clinical history in T2DM provides a wealth of pharmacokinetic and safety data that can serve as a foundation for exploring new applications. Nevertheless, the direct evidence for preventing muscle wasting via improved Ca²⁺ handling remains limited, and safety concerns—particularly in the elderly—must be carefully balanced against the potential benefits. The evidence suggests that while rosiglitazone has a strong mechanistic rationale for use in sarcopenia, further rigorous preclinical studies that specifically evaluate muscle function and direct measurements of mitochondrial and Ca²⁺ handling parameters in aged muscle are needed. Follow-up early-phase clinical trials should incorporate robust muscle-specific endpoints, including measurements of muscle mass, strength, functional performance, and biomarkers of oxidative stress. Only by addressing these gaps can we determine whether rosiglitazone’s metabolic reprogramming, aimed at protecting components like RyR1 and SERCA, can translate into tangible improvements in muscle health in the elderly (Cheng et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2004; Wu & Tien, 2020).

Apelin-13 analog (Aib2-Apelin-13),"Proposal for Apelin-13 analog (Aib2-Apelin-13)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Aib2‐Apelin‐13 is a chemically modified derivative of apelin‐13, an endogenous peptide that naturally binds the apelin receptor (APJ/APLNR), a G protein‐coupled receptor (GPCR) widely expressed in cardiovascular and skeletal muscle tissues. Apelin peptides are originally derived from a 77–amino acid preproapelin precursor that is enzymatically cleaved into several bioactive fragments (e.g., apelin‐36, apelin‐17, apelin‐13) with the shorter isoforms often demonstrating higher receptor binding potency. Aib2‐Apelin‐13 falls into the class of peptide receptor agonists and is specifically designed with an amino acid substitution, incorporating an alpha‐aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) at position 2. This substitution is intended to create a proteolysis‐resistant analog that resists rapid enzymatic degradation, thereby extending its circulating half‐life and ensuring sustained receptor activation in vivo. The synthetic origins of Aib2‐Apelin‐13 involve solid‐phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc chemistry, followed by purification via HPLC and verification through mass spectrometry to ensure a purity greater than 95% (Cecconi et al., 2022, pp. 4–5). This class of compounds – proteolysis‐resistant peptide analogs – has been explored in various contexts, particularly in cardiovascular and metabolic applications, where modifications to native peptides have been used to overcome physiological limitations such as short half‐life and rapid receptor desensitization (Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 1–6; Vinel et al., 2018, pp. 1–5).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, the apelin/APJ receptor system has been investigated extensively for its roles in cardiovascular regulation, energy metabolism, and muscle physiology. Early studies highlighted that apelin peptide administration improves cardiac contractility and lowers blood pressure, outcomes that have spurred interest in its potential utility in heart failure (Parikh et al., 2018, pp. 1–3; Pisarenko et al., 2015, pp. 1–4). In recent years, emerging research has extended these findings to muscle physiology, with experimental evidence suggesting that the natural apelin peptide declines with age and that its deficiency contributes to sarcopenia – the age‐associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and function (Vinel et al., 2018, pp. 1–5; Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 17–19). Preclinical studies, especially those utilizing murine models of muscle atrophy such as cancer cachexia, have shown that exogenous administration of apelin peptides can mitigate muscle proteolysis and improve muscle fiber cross‐sectional area (Cecconi et al., 2022, pp. 7–10). Although direct clinical trials in sarcopenia populations with apelin receptor agonists are still scarce, several clinical trials have evaluated the vascular effects of apelin peptides in humans (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), and emerging therapeutic strategies for conditions like diabetes and heart failure have included investigation of these compounds (Najm et al., 2024, pp. 6–7). Therefore, while Aib2‐Apelin‐13 itself is novel, its pharmacological class has a documented history in both cardiovascular and metabolic systems, and recent preclinical evidence strongly suggests its potential for repurposing in sarcopenia.

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism by which Aib2‐Apelin‐13 is hypothesized to work involves targeting the APJ receptor on skeletal muscle cells to restore impaired intracellular calcium handling that is a hallmark of aged myotubes. Under normal conditions, activation of the APJ receptor – which couples primarily to Gq/11 proteins – stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) activity leading to the generation of inositol 1,4,5‐trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 subsequently binds to its receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), triggering Ca²⁺ release into the cytoplasm. This surging Ca²⁺ is then partially taken up by mitochondria through specialized ER–mitochondrial contact sites, thereby enhancing ATP production necessary for muscle contraction and sustaining excitation–contraction coupling (Read, 2019, pp. 213–217; Bae et al., 2019, pp. 9–10). Aging is associated with a decline in apelin expression and a concomitant reduction in IP3-mediated SR Ca²⁺ release and mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, contributing to blunted calcium transients and impaired bioenergetics in muscle fibers (Zhou et al., 2018, pp. 1–2; Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 19–22). Aib2‐Apelin‐13, by virtue of its enhanced stability from proteolytic resistance, is able to bind and activate the APJ receptor for an extended period. This sustained receptor engagement is posited to restore normal IP3 generation, amplify SR Ca²⁺ release, and consequently improve mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake. Improved mitochondrial calcium load is critical for the activation of dehydrogenase enzymes in the Krebs cycle, thereby boosting ATP synthesis and improving muscle contractility (Bae et al., 2019, pp. 1–2; Enoki et al., 2023, pp. 11–12). Additionally, APJ receptor activation through stable agonists like Aib2‐Apelin‐13 has downstream effects on anabolic signaling pathways, including increased phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR effectors (Cecconi et al., 2022, pp. 16–17; Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 11–14). These pathways not only promote protein synthesis in muscle cells but also inhibit proteolysis by downregulating the activity of muscle‐specific ubiquitin ligases such as MuRF1. The combined effect of enhanced calcium handling and anabolic signaling is expected to preserve muscle fiber size and contractile function in the aging population.

Expected Effect:
In the context of sarcopenia, the primary expected effect of Aib2‐Apelin‐13 would be the restoration of normal calcium transients in aged myotubes. Specifically, by enhancing IP3-mediated SR Ca²⁺ release coupled with efficient mitochondrial uptake, the drug candidate is expected to increase the amplitude of Ca²⁺ transients, thereby improving excitation–contraction coupling in skeletal muscle fibers. The activation of the APJ receptor and subsequent stimulation of downstream signaling pathways (e.g., AKT/mTOR) should also result in a reduction in proteolytic degradation and an increase in protein synthesis. This dual action not only supports mitochondrial bioenergetics – critical for ATP production during muscle contraction – but also contributes to maintaining muscle mass by preventing atrophy (Vinel et al., 2018, pp. 8–10; Cecconi et al., 2022, pp. 16–17). In vitro assays using aged myotubes are anticipated to demonstrate improved Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and more robust mitochondrial activity upon treatment with Aib2‐Apelin‐13. Furthermore, given that APJ receptor expression is maintained in skeletal muscle despite age-related declines in circulating apelin levels (Ochoa et al., 2023), direct receptor activation by a stabilized analog is likely to yield measurable improvements in muscle contractile function and may even ameliorate other aspects of muscle aging such as reduced endurance and strength (Najm et al., 2024, pp. 6–7; Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 17–19). The drug’s mechanism is also expected to have an anti-catabolic effect, decreasing the expression of atrophy markers (e.g., MuRF1) and promoting overall proteostasis in skeletal muscle tissue.

Overall Evaluation:
The evaluation of Aib2‐Apelin‐13 as a therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia is highly promising but not without certain challenges. One of the major strengths of this candidate lies in its rational design: by stabilizing a naturally occurring peptide through Aib substitution, it overcomes a key limitation of native apelin peptides – rapid proteolytic degradation and short plasma half-life – thereby ensuring more sustained activation of the APJ receptor (Cecconi et al., 2022, pp. 4–5; Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 11–14). This enhanced stability is critical because it allows for prolonged modulation of intracellular calcium dynamics, which is central to improving both the energetic profile and contractile function of aged muscle fibers. Mechanistically, the candidate addresses well‐validated pathogenic drivers of sarcopenia by restoring IP3-mediated SR Ca²⁺ release and facilitating mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, which are essential for maintaining muscle bioenergetics and excitation–contraction coupling (Read, 2019, pp. 213–217; Bae et al., 2019, pp. 9–10).

Additional strengths include the potential downstream anabolic benefits mediated via AKT and mTOR signaling pathways. These benefits may contribute to preserving muscle mass beyond the acute improvements in contractile function, addressing both the functional and structural aspects of sarcopenia (Cecconi et al., 2022, pp. 16–17; Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 19–22). Moreover, preclinical studies have demonstrated the promise of apelin receptor agonists in reversing age‐related muscle atrophy and improving muscle function (Vinel et al., 2018, pp. 8–10; Najm et al., 2024, pp. 6–7).

However, there are challenges and potential weaknesses. One concern is that while the preclinical evidence is compelling, clinical translation remains to be firmly established since most studies to date have been conducted in animal models or in vitro settings. There is a need for robust clinical trials targeting sarcopenia to confirm efficacy and safety in the elderly human population (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, as observed in some cachectic models, high circulating apelin levels may sometimes lead to receptor desensitization or “apelin resistance” in muscle tissue. Although the use of a proteolysis-resistant analog is designed to overcome these hurdles, it will be critical to monitor receptor sensitivity and downstream signaling over longer treatment durations (Cecconi et al., 2022, pp. 7–10; Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 17–19).

Another consideration is the specificity of the drug’s action. While the activation of the APJ receptor appears to have beneficial effects on muscle contractility and energy metabolism, the APJ receptor is also expressed in other tissues such as the cardiovascular system and adipose tissue. It will therefore be essential to design dosing regimens and delivery methods that preferentially target skeletal muscle to minimize off-target effects. This may involve exploring local delivery strategies or modifying the pharmacokinetics to favor muscle uptake (Read, 2019, pp. 200–204; Enoki et al., 2023, pp. 10–11).

Overall, the mechanistic rationale supporting Aib2‐Apelin‐13’s action in enhancing IP3-mediated Ca²⁺ release and improving mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake is well grounded in current understanding of muscle physiology and the pathophysiology of sarcopenia (Zhou et al., 2018, pp. 1–2; Bae et al., 2019, pp. 9–10). Its design as a proteolysis-resistant analog directly addresses the issue of short peptide half-life that has historically limited the therapeutic utility of native apelin. Preclinical data provide encouraging evidence that modulation of the apelin/APJ axis can restore more youthful intracellular calcium signaling profiles, leading to improved energy production and contractile performance in aged myotubes (Vinel et al., 2018, pp. 8–10; Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 19–22). In summary, while further work is needed to confirm clinical efficacy and optimize delivery, Aib2‐Apelin‐13 represents a promising and innovative therapeutic candidate for the treatment of sarcopenia, with a solid scientific rationale supported by biochemical, preclinical, and emerging clinical insights (Najm et al., 2024, pp. 6–7; Cecconi et al., 2022, pp. 16–17; Read, 2019, pp. 213–217).

Spermidine,"Proposal for Spermidine

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Spermidine is a naturally occurring polyamine that is endogenously synthesized and ubiquitously present in all living cells. It is found at high concentrations in various plant‐derived foods such as soybeans, whole grains, and certain fruits, and it plays essential roles in cell proliferation, gene expression, and protein translation. As a member of the polyamine class, spermidine belongs to a group of small, aliphatic cations that have been extensively studied for their capacity to induce autophagy, modulate cellular stress responses, and extend lifespan in diverse experimental systems (Galasso et al., 2023). Polyamines, including spermidine, have traditionally been explored for their functions in stabilizing DNA and RNA, facilitating ribosome biogenesis, and protecting against oxidative stress; these properties have been exploited in various research settings to promote cellular homeostasis (Galasso et al., 2023). The discovery of spermidine’s autophagy‐inducing properties has repositioned it as a potential therapeutic nutraceutical for aging‐related diseases, with proof‐of‐concept studies demonstrating lifespan extension and cardioprotection in preclinical models (Eisenberg et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Spermidine’s therapeutic potential has been highlighted in a number of preclinical studies addressing aging and muscle function. Numerous studies in animal models, including mouse models of muscle dystrophy and aging, have shown that spermidine supplementation improves muscle mass, enhances mitochondrial function, and activates autophagic pathways, which in turn restores proper cellular metabolism and protein homeostasis (Fan et al., 2017; Chen & Wu, 2025). Clinical and epidemiological investigations have linked higher spermidine levels in whole blood with healthy aging and longevity, and several clinical trials have been initiated to assess its metabolic and autophagic effects in elderly subjects; for example, the trial NCT06186102 investigates polyamine treatment in elderly patients with coronary artery disease with secondary outcomes evaluating muscle characteristics, and NCT05459961 evaluates metabolic responses to spermidine supplementation in older men (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022). While direct clinical studies in sarcopenia are still emerging, the collective evidence from preclinical models of muscle aging and from endpoints relating to mitochondrial quality and autophagy markers in muscle strongly suggest that spermidine has promising potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for age-related muscle decline, including sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Galasso et al., 2023). Moreover, prior work in animal models of muscle dystrophy and autophagy-deficient conditions such as collagen VI-related myopathy demonstrated that spermidine reactivates autophagy, improves muscle histopathology, and increases force generation, which indirectly supports its potential for conditions characterized by impaired muscle function like sarcopenia (Chrisam et al., 2015; Giourmas, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, spermidine exerts its beneficial effects primarily through the induction of autophagy, a key intracellular degradation pathway that recycles damaged proteins and organelles to maintain cellular homeostasis. Spermidine is known to inhibit the activity of acetyltransferases such as EP300, resulting in hypoacetylation of key autophagy modulators, thereby lifting the block on autophagic flux (Chrisam et al., 2015). This inhibition allows for the activation of the autophagy machinery, leading to the formation of autophagosomes and their subsequent fusion with lysosomes. In muscle cells, the activation of autophagy is particularly important for the removal of oxidatively damaged proteins and organelles; preclinical studies have demonstrated that spermidine supplementation increases markers of autophagosome formation such as lipidated LC3B (LC3B-II) and decreases the accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates (Fan et al., 2017; Chen & Wu, 2025).

The hypothesis under consideration proposes that in aged human myotubes, spermidine supplementation facilitates the autophagy-mediated turnover of oxidized calcium (Ca²⁺) handling proteins—specifically, the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) and the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA). RyR1 is a critical channel located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane that mediates Ca²⁺ release during excitation–contraction coupling, while SERCA is responsible for reuptaking Ca²⁺ back into the SR during muscle relaxation. Oxidative modifications of these proteins in aged muscle can lead to a pathological increase in SR Ca²⁺ leak and impaired reuptake kinetics, ultimately reducing Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and impairing contractile function (Chen & Wu, 2025).

Spermidine’s known mechanism—promoting autophagy—could theoretically support the clearance of these oxidized, dysfunctional proteins and facilitate their replacement with newly synthesized, functional proteins. Although direct evidence linking spermidine to enhanced turnover of oxidized RyR1 or SERCA in aged muscle is presently limited in the literature, several studies have shown that spermidine reactivates autophagy in muscle cells, which is critical for maintaining organellar quality and protein function (Galasso et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2017). Moreover, improved mitochondrial function and reduced apoptosis following spermidine supplementation further support enhanced cellular homeostasis that may indirectly restore proper Ca²⁺ handling (Iwata et al., 2025; Galasso et al., 2023).

In terms of biochemical specificity, spermidine is orally bioavailable and has a favorable safety profile in both preclinical and early clinical settings; its mechanism of inducing autophagy is more selective than broad antioxidant mechanisms because it targets the clearance of damaged protein aggregates rather than simply scavenging reactive oxygen species (Fan et al., 2017; Filfan et al., 2020). This specificity offers a mechanistically distinct route for restoring muscle Ca²⁺ homeostasis: by specifically enhancing autophagic clearance, spermidine may remove oxidatively modified RyR1 and SERCA, thereby reducing aberrant Ca²⁺ leak and improving SR Ca²⁺ reuptake kinetics, which are essential determinants of muscle contractile efficiency (Chen & Wu, 2025; Galasso et al., 2023).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, the expected effect of spermidine supplementation in aged human myotubes is twofold. First, by upregulating autophagic flux, spermidine is expected to accelerate the removal of oxidatively damaged and dysfunctional proteins, including RyR1 and SERCA. Second, the clearance of these oxidized proteins should lead to a restoration of proper Ca²⁺ handling dynamics within the muscle cells—specifically, a reduction in pathological SR Ca²⁺ leak and an improvement in reuptake kinetics at the SR: both of these improvements would culminate in a higher amplitude Ca²⁺ transient during muscle contraction (Chen & Wu, 2025; Fan et al., 2017).

In the proposed assay using aged human myotubes, one would anticipate observing the following outcomes: an increase in markers of autophagy (such as LC3B-II and decreased p62 levels), improved mitochondrial morphology and function, and, most importantly, a measurable improvement in Ca²⁺ transient parameters using calcium imaging techniques. The enhanced Ca²⁺ transient amplitude is hypothesized to correlate with increased contractile output, as precise Ca²⁺ handling is critical for the excitation–contraction cycle in skeletal muscle fibers (Galasso et al., 2023; Giourmas, 2021).

Proteomic studies in aged muscle have indicated that the expression of RyR1 and SERCA is maintained in human myotubes; however, their function becomes compromised due to oxidative modifications that alter their conformation and activity. Thus, a successful spermidine intervention would not necessarily increase the abundance of these proteins but would rather restore their function by facilitating the turnover of the oxidized pool (Chen & Wu, 2025; Galasso et al., 2023). Moreover, previous reports in animal models have shown that spermidine supplementation results in improved muscle force output and amelioration of myopathic defects, indirectly supporting the idea that enhanced autophagy can translate into better muscle contractility (Chrisam et al., 2015; Giourmas, 2021).

Expression analysis of Ca²⁺ handling proteins in myotubes confirms that RyR1 and SERCA are indeed expressed in these cells, and autophagy-related genes are upregulated in response to spermidine, indicating that the molecular machinery necessary for this therapeutic mechanism is present and potentially modifiable in aged human muscle cells (Galasso et al., 2023; Han et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, spermidine emerges as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of sarcopenia based on both its mechanistic rationale and supporting preclinical evidence. One of the major strengths of spermidine lies in its dual action: its autophagy-inducing capability has been robustly demonstrated in various preclinical models of muscle aging and myopathy, and its favorable safety profile and oral bioavailability make it an attractive candidate for human application (Galasso et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024). Its mechanistic specificity—in targeting the turnover of oxidized, malfunctioning proteins rather than broadly quenching reactive oxygen species—is particularly advantageous, as it allows for the selective restoration of function in critical components of the muscle contractile apparatus such as RyR1 and SERCA, which are known to be compromised in the aging process (Chen & Wu, 2025; Fan et al., 2017).

However, there are also notable challenges and weaknesses. Although the preclinical data in animal models are compelling and there is emerging evidence from humans regarding safety and metabolic effects, direct demonstration of spermidine’s ability to specifically enhance the turnover of oxidized Ca²⁺ handling proteins in aged human myotubes remains to be conclusively established. Most current studies have focused on general markers of autophagy and improvements in muscle histology and function without animal or human data directly linking spermidine to changes in RyR1 or SERCA function (Galasso et al., 2023; Chen & Wu, 2025). Additionally, while several clinical trials (e.g., NCT06186102) are evaluating the broader metabolic effects and autophagy induction by spermidine in aged patients, none have yet provided direct evidence for improved Ca²⁺ handling or increased contractility in skeletal muscle, which is the central premise of the current therapeutic hypothesis (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Another potential limitation is the translation of these cellular and animal model results to the clinical setting. Aging human muscle is influenced by a complex interplay of systemic factors including hormonal changes, chronic inflammation, and reduced regenerative capacity; hence, even significant improvements in autophagy might need to be complemented by other interventions to achieve robust clinical benefits in sarcopenia. Moreover, the dosing and long-term effects of spermidine supplementation require further optimization, as prior studies have indicated that high levels of spermidine may, in some contexts, induce excessive autophagy that could adversely affect muscle function (Chrisam et al., 2015).

In summary, the repurposing of spermidine as a therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia is supported by extensive preclinical evidence showing that it extends lifespan and improves muscle function by inducing autophagy. The proposed mechanism—that spermidine selectively clears oxidized RyR1 and SERCA, thereby restoring proper Ca²⁺ handling and enhancing contractile performance—is biologically plausible, given that autophagy is critically involved in the removal of dysfunctional proteins in aged muscle. Although direct evidence on the turnover of oxidized Ca²⁺ handling proteins by spermidine remains to be fully validated, the overall body of literature indicates significant potential for spermidine in mitigating muscle aging. Strengths of this approach include its natural origin, oral bioavailability, favorable safety profile, and a clearly defined mechanistic pathway for enhancing muscle quality. Weaknesses relate mainly to the current gap in direct evidence linking spermidine to improved Ca²⁺ handling at the molecular level in human myotubes and the need for further clinical studies to ascertain its efficacy specifically in sarcopenia. Nonetheless, based on the comprehensive review of biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature, spermidine represents a compelling candidate for further investigation as a therapeutic intervention for sarcopenia (Fan et al., 2017; Han et al., 2022; Galasso et al., 2023).

KN-93,"Proposal for KN-93

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
KN-93 is a fully synthetic small-molecule drug that was originally developed as a research tool for selectively inhibiting calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). It belongs to a class of sulfonamide derivatives designed to antagonize the calmodulin (CaM) binding process that is essential for CaMKII activation. The molecule’s chemical structure, described as N-[2-[[[3-(4′-chlorophenyl)-2-propenyl]-methylamino]methyl]phenyl]-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4′-methoxybenzenesulfonamide phosphate, identifies it as belonging to the arylsulfonamide and isoquinoline-sulfonamide family (Brzozowski & Skelding, 2019, pp. 16–17; Franchini et al., 2010, pp. 1–2). Synthetic methodologies have evolved for KN-93; for example, microwave-assisted reductive amination strategies have improved the efficiency and yield of its production (Franchini et al., 2010, pp. 4–5). Historically, KN-93 was discovered during the early phases of CaMKII inhibitor development, arising from efforts to generate compounds that could modulate intracellular calcium signaling by targeting the calmodulin-dependent activation step rather than competing at the ATP-binding site. This specific mechanism of action places KN-93 in a category of allosteric inhibitors that, rather than occupying the enzyme’s catalytic pocket, block the conformational transition necessary for activation by binding to the Ca2+/CaM complex (Wong et al., 2019, pp. 1–3; Pellicena & Schulman, 2014, pp. 2–3). In addition to its established use in cardiovascular and neurological research, KN-93 represents an important prototype for repurposing studies because its robust cell permeability and well-characterized inhibitory properties provide a solid foundation for exploring new therapeutic indications such as sarcopenia.

Therapeutic History:
KN-93 has a long history in preclinical pharmacological research, primarily as a tool to dissect the role of CaMKII in various pathological and physiological processes. In cardiac studies, KN-93 has been instrumental in revealing that CaMKII hyperactivity contributes to pathological phosphorylation events associated with heart failure, arrhythmogenesis, and defective calcium handling (Sossalla et al., 2010, pp. 7–9; Beauverger et al., 2020). It has also been extensively used in studies of neuronal signaling and synaptic plasticity, where its ability to inhibit CaMKII modulates processes such as long-term potentiation and synaptic tagging (Redondo et al., 2010, pp. 3–4; Pellicena & Schulman, 2014, pp. 9–10). In oncology research, KN-93 has been explored in various cancer cell lines, where its off-target effects—such as inhibition of voltage-gated ion channels—were noted alongside its primary CaMKII-inhibitory function (Brzozowski & Skelding, 2019, pp. 26–28). Importantly, a search of clinical trial registries for “KN-93 OR CaMKII inhibitor AND (sarcopenia OR muscle wasting OR aging OR skeletal muscle)” returned no registered clinical trials, indicating that KN-93’s utility has not previously been evaluated in human studies for sarcopenia or related muscle wasting conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In the context of muscle biology, preclinical paradigms have begun to validate the role of CaMKII and its downstream target, the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1), in skeletal muscle function and aging (Pellicena & Schulman, 2014, pp. 2–3; Yuasa et al., 2018, pp. 3–5). Although KN-93 has not been explicitly used for treating sarcopenia, the mechanistic insights gained from cardiac and neuronal models have prompted proposals for its repurposing. Thus, while its history has been dominated by applications in cardiovascular and cancer research, there is growing experimental evidence that the inhibitory modulation of CaMKII by KN-93 could be leveraged to address muscle wasting pathologies.

Mechanism of Action:
The molecular mechanism of KN-93 centers on its ability to inhibit CaMKII by targeting the Ca2+/calmodulin activation process. CaMKII is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase that must bind Ca2+-bound calmodulin to transition from an autoinhibited state to an active conformation. KN-93 interferes with this process by binding directly to the Ca2+/calmodulin complex itself, rather than the kinase active site. This binding prevents the necessary displacement of CaMKII’s autoinhibitory regulatory segment, thereby forestalling autophosphorylation at critical residues such as Thr286/287, which are essential for achieving persistent kinase activity (Wong et al., 2019, pp. 18–19; Pellicena & Schulman, 2014, pp. 2–3). By competitively inhibiting the Ca2+/CaM binding step, KN-93 blocks the enzyme’s transition to the active state, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of downstream substrates. One such substrate is the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1), a calcium release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle cells. In aged myotubes, hyperactivation of CaMKII can lead to increased phosphorylation of RyR1, which in turn promotes pathological Ca2+ leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Pellicena & Schulman, 2014, pp. 2–3; Wong et al., 2019, pp. 18–19). This Ca2+ leak contributes directly to muscle weakness and may underlie the physiological deterioration observed in sarcopenia. In vitro biochemical assays have determined that KN-93 exhibits effective inhibitory potency, with low micromolar IC50 values under conditions where Ca2+/CaM is the activating ligand, supporting its use as a reliable and cell-permeable inhibitor (Wong et al., 2019, pp. 14–16; Franchini et al., 2010, pp. 5–6). It is important to note that while KN-93 acts by binding to Ca2+/CaM, there is also evidence that it may exert off-target effects on ion channels such as L-type Ca2+ channels and voltage-gated potassium channels, necessitating the use of inactive analogs like KN-92 in experimental designs to confirm specificity (Pellicena & Schulman, 2014, pp. 3–5; Hegyi et al., 2015).

Expected Effect:
The therapeutic hypothesis for repurposing KN-93 in sarcopenia is based on its capacity to modulate aberrant CaMKII activity that develops with aging. In aged myotubes and skeletal muscle tissue, it is proposed that hyperactive CaMKII leads to pathological phosphorylation of RyR1. Elevated RyR1 phosphorylation increases spontaneous Ca2+ leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, depleting stored Ca2+ and disrupting the precise control of Ca2+ transients that are essential for effective muscle contraction. By administering KN-93, it is expected that the compound will reduce RyR1 phosphorylation by selectively inhibiting CaMKII, thus stabilizing calcium homeostasis within muscle cells. In vitro assays should reveal a reduction in the frequency and duration of Ca2+ sparks—localized and transient Ca2+ release events from the sarcoplasmic reticulum—that are typically elevated in aged muscle fibers (Wong et al., 2019, pp. 18–19; Pellicena & Schulman, 2014, pp. 2–3). With a decrease in pathological SR Ca2+ leak, the SR Ca2+ stores should be better preserved, leading to improved amplitude and consistency of evoked Ca2+ transients during electrically stimulated contraction. This restoration of calcium handling would be expected to translate to enhanced contractile function and reduced muscle fatigue, both of which are key factors in countering the clinical manifestations of sarcopenia. Importantly, skeletal muscle has been shown to express CaMKII as well as RyR1, and the link between their dysregulated activity and muscle weakness has been supported by studies in both preclinical skeletal muscle models and denervation-induced atrophy paradigms (Yuasa et al., 2018, pp. 3–5; Pellicena & Schulman, 2014, pp. 2–3). In this context, KN-93’s ability to interfere with the pathway leading to RyR1 hyperphosphorylation represents a direct mechanistic intervention that addresses a molecular hallmark of muscle aging.

Overall Evaluation:
The evaluation of KN-93 as a potential therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia reveals both promising strengths and notable weaknesses. One of the principal strengths of KN-93 is its well-defined mechanism of action. By specifically targeting the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activation process of CaMKII, KN-93 directly interferes with a key node that has been implicated in the dysregulation of calcium handling in aging skeletal muscle. This mechanistic rationale is supported by biochemical and cellular studies demonstrating that excessive CaMKII activity leads to increased phosphorylation of RyR1, promoting SR Ca2+ leak and contributing to muscle fatigue and weakness (Wong et al., 2019, pp. 18–19; Pellicena & Schulman, 2014, pp. 2–3). The use of KN-93 in various preclinical models—as observed in cardiac and neuronal studies—provides a strong proof-of-concept that CaMKII inhibition can have beneficial effects on calcium regulation, lending credibility to its repurposing for sarcopenia. In terms of translational feasibility, KN-93 is cell-permeable and has been shown to be effective at low micromolar concentrations in vitro, suggesting that appropriate dosing regimens can be established in subsequent preclinical studies. The compound’s ability to modulate key targets in the CaMKII signaling cascade, coupled with its direct impact on RyR1 phosphorylation, aligns well with the proposed therapeutic hypothesis that preventing SR Ca2+ leak will improve muscle function in aged individuals.

However, there are also several weaknesses and challenges that must be addressed before KN-93 can be considered a strong candidate for clinical development in sarcopenia. First, the clinical history of KN-93 indicates that it has not been evaluated in clinical trials for sarcopenia or muscle wasting conditions. Searches in clinical trial databases have returned no studies using KN-93 in this context, implying that its safety profile and efficacy in human muscle have not been established (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Second, KN-93 is known to display off-target effects, including inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels and voltage-gated potassium channels. These off-target activities complicate the interpretation of experimental results and could lead to unintended side effects if not carefully controlled. The use of inactive analogs such as KN-92 in experimental studies is essential to dissect CaMKII-specific effects and to ensure that observed benefits in muscle function are due solely to correction of aberrant CaMKII-RyR1 signaling (Pellicena & Schulman, 2014, pp. 3–5; Hegyi et al., 2015). Third, while KN-93 is effective in in vitro and some preclinical settings, its pharmacokinetic properties in vivo—particularly regarding oral bioavailability and metabolic stability in humans—are relatively underexplored. This lack of data may pose challenges in optimizing dosing regimens and ensuring sustained therapeutic levels in muscle tissue without systemic toxicity.

Despite these concerns, the overall evaluation suggests that KN-93 possesses a compelling mechanistic rationale as a candidate for repurposing in sarcopenia. The expected effect of reducing pathological RyR1 phosphorylation and stabilizing SR Ca2+ stores directly addresses the cellular dysfunction observed in aging muscle. Moreover, the extensive body of preclinical research documenting the role of CaMKII in diseases of cardiac and skeletal muscle provides a strong foundation for further investigation. Future studies should focus on conducting detailed pharmacokinetic and toxicological evaluations of KN-93 in animal models of sarcopenia, as well as exploring targeted delivery methods (such as nanoparticle-based formulations) to enhance tissue specificity and minimize off-target effects. It may also be valuable to compare KN-93 with newer CaMKII inhibitors that have improved selectivity and bioavailability profiles, to determine whether KN-93 represents the optimal candidate for translation or if further optimization is required.

In conclusion, KN-93 offers a promising yet preliminary approach to addressing sarcopenia via inhibition of CaMKII and subsequent correction of RyR1-mediated calcium leak. The strengths of this candidate lie in its well-characterized mechanism of action, its demonstrated efficacy in other disease models where calcium dysregulation is key, and its cell-permeable nature that allows for modulation of intracellular signaling pathways. The primary weaknesses center on its limited clinical evaluation in muscle wasting conditions, potential off-target activities, and the need for more comprehensive in vivo pharmacokinetic data. Overall, while KN-93 is not yet ready for clinical use as a therapy for sarcopenia, its mechanistic profile and preclinical track record justify further investigation, including detailed animal studies and formulation improvements that could ultimately pave the way for its repurposing as a therapeutic agent for muscle degeneration in aging populations (Wong et al., 2019, pp. 1–3; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Pellicena & Schulman, 2014, pp. 2–3).

BGP-15 (O-(3-piperidino-2-hydroxy-1-propyl)nicotinic acid amidoxime),"Proposal for BGP-15 (O-(3-piperidino-2-hydroxy-1-propyl)nicotinic acid amidoxime)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
BGP-15, chemically designated as O-(3-piperidino-2-hydroxy-1-propyl)nicotinic acid amidoxime, is a small molecular entity originally discovered as an insulin sensitizer by Hungarian researchers and later repurposed as a heat shock protein (HSP) co‐inducer with broad cytoprotective activities (Pető et al., 2020, pp. 1–3). It belongs to a class of synthetic small molecules that target cellular stress pathways by modulating chaperone induction, and these compounds have been used principally in metabolic disorders, cardiomyopathies, and neuromuscular disease models (Campelj et al., 2020, pp. 1–3). BGP-15 is synthesized via chemical derivatization processes that yield a nicotinic amidoxime derivative with favorable physicochemical properties, including moderate molecular weight and high water solubility, which collectively facilitate oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetic stability (Pető et al., 2020, pp. 1–3). The compound is categorized within the broader therapeutic class of HSP co‐inducers—a group of molecules that, rather than directly inhibiting a pathological target, promote the cellular capacity to resist stress by upregulating endogenous chaperone proteins such as HSP70 and HSP90 (Budzyński et al., 2017, pp. 1–2). Previous studies of compounds within this class suggest that they can mitigate proteotoxic stress, improve protein folding and repair, and thereby preserve cellular function during states of metabolic or inflammatory injury (Pető et al., 2020, pp. 1–3).

Therapeutic History:
BGP-15 has been evaluated extensively in preclinical models of several diseases including type 2 diabetes, heart failure, and various myopathies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and chemotherapy-induced cachexia (Campelj et al., 2020, pp. 22–24; Nascimento et al., 2020, pp. 1–2). In diabetic animal models, the molecule has demonstrated the ability to improve insulin sensitivity, presumably via amelioration of systemic oxidative stress and improved mitochondrial function (Pető et al., 2020, pp. 1–3). In models of heart failure and atrial fibrillation, BGP-15 has been shown to reduce oxidative stress, partly by modulating mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhancing contractile function (Pető et al., 2020, pp. 8–10). Importantly, in neuromuscular applications, BGP-15 has been repurposed for studies in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, where its administration improved dystrophic pathology and extended survival in mdx and dko mice by means of heat shock protein induction and stabilization of cellular proteins (Gehrig et al., 2012, pp. 3–4). Although BGP-15 has not been directly tested in dedicated clinical trials for sarcopenia, its extensive preclinical evaluation in muscle-wasting conditions such as ventilation-induced diaphragm dysfunction, mechanical silencing-induced atrophy, and chemotherapy-induced muscle damage renders it a compelling candidate for further investigation in age-related muscle wasting (Campelj et al., 2020, pp. 1–3; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
BGP-15 functions primarily as a heat shock protein co‐inducer, acting through the modulation of the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) that drives the expression of critical chaperones, specifically HSP70 (also referred to as HSP72) and HSP90 (Nascimento et al., 2020, pp. 1–2). The underlying mechanism involves a mild, non-proteotoxic stress signal that triggers HSF1 activation via Rac1-mediated signaling pathways and a consequent NADPH oxidase activation, ultimately leading to de-repression of HSP gene expression (Nascimento et al., 2020, pp. 1–2). Additionally, BGP-15 has been shown to inhibit poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), thereby preventing the deleterious consequences of excessive PARP activation such as mitochondrial dysfunction and energetic collapse, which are common in conditions of cellular stress (Campelj et al., 2020, pp. 24–25). It also displays properties of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition, enhancing chromatin accessibility at stress-responsive gene loci and further expediting HSP induction (Budzyński et al., 2017, pp. 1–2). A particularly innovative aspect of its mechanism is the chaperone-mediated stabilization of key sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) proteins, including SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase) and RyR1 (ryanodine receptor 1), which are critical for calcium handling in skeletal muscle (Gehrig et al., 2012, p. 3). HSP70, whose expression is increased by BGP-15, has been directly associated with the preservation of SERCA activity under oxidative stress conditions by preventing detrimental post-translational modifications, thereby sustaining effective calcium uptake into the SR (Gehrig et al., 2012, pp. 3, 6). Consequently, the stabilization of SERCA and potentially RyR1 by HSP-mediated chaperone activity is expected to normalize Ca2⁺ transients in aged myotubes, reducing pathological SR Ca2⁺ leak and improving contractile efficiency (Terrell et al., 2023, pp. 6–7). This mechanism differentiates BGP-15 from direct channel agonists or antioxidants; rather, it uses an indirect, chaperone-driven approach to enforce proteostasis and functional stabilization of critical calcium-handling proteins (Pető et al., 2020, pp. 8–10).

Expected Effect:
In the context of sarcopenia, the expected effect of BGP-15 is to enhance muscle strength and quality by addressing a core pathogenic hallmark—dysregulated calcium signaling. A robust induction of heat shock proteins, particularly HSP70 and HSP90, is anticipated to stabilize SR Ca2⁺ handling proteins (SERCA and RyR1) in aged skeletal muscle fibers, thus promoting efficient calcium uptake during muscle relaxation and minimizing aberrant calcium leak that impairs contractile function (Gehrig et al., 2012, p. 3; Nascimento et al., 2018, pp. 4–5). This stabilization is expected to result in the normalization of Ca2⁺ transient amplitude and kinetics, which are crucial for excitation–contraction coupling in myotubes, thereby improving muscle force generation and fatigue resistance (Nascimento et al., 2018, pp. 1–2; Terrell et al., 2023, pp. 6–7). In vitro assays using aged myotubes are predicted to show increased expression of HSP70 and HSP90 as early biomarkers following BGP-15 treatment (Nascimento et al., 2020, pp. 1–2). Furthermore, the augmented chaperone activity should also protect against proteotoxic stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby indirectly preserving the integrity of other muscle contractile proteins (Ohlen et al., 2017, p. 6). The hypothesis supports that the drug will enhance SR Ca2⁺ uptake efficiency by stabilizing SERCA conformation, reduce pathological calcium leak through RyR1 stabilization, and ultimately improve the amplitude and kinetics of calcium transients, which translates biochemically into improved muscle contractility and a potential reversal of sarcopenic degeneration (Campelj et al., 2020, pp. 22–24; Terrell et al., 2023, pp. 6–7).

Overall Evaluation:
The accumulated literature provides substantial preclinical evidence that BGP-15 is a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for treating sarcopenia due to its multifaceted mechanism of action centered on heat shock protein co-induction. One of the main strengths of BGP-15 lies in its ability to upregulate HSP70 and HSP90 via the activation of HSF1, thereby conferring cytoprotection and stabilization of key muscle proteins which suffer from age-dependent dysfunction. The chaperone-mediated stabilization of SERCA and RyR1 is particularly relevant, as calcium mishandling is a well-established contributor to sarcopenia pathology; maintaining proper SR Ca²⁺ handling can ameliorate contractile deficits and promote muscle repair (Gehrig et al., 2012, p. 3; Terrell et al., 2023, pp. 6–7). Another strength is BGP-15’s favorable pharmacokinetic profile, attributable to its small molecular weight and oral bioavailability, as well as encouraging safety signals from Phase I clinical trials in populations with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (Pető et al., 2020, pp. 1–3; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, BGP-15’s mechanism, which utilizes indirect chaperone activation rather than direct inhibition or blockade of calcium channels, may allow for broader maintenance of proteostasis in aging muscle—an advantage over therapies that target only one aspect of calcium signaling or oxidative stress (Pető et al., 2020, pp. 8–10; Budzyński et al., 2017, pp. 1–2).

However, there are several weaknesses and gaps in the current evidence base. First, despite promising results in animal models of muscular dystrophy, chemotherapy-induced myopathy, and ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction, there is insufficient direct clinical data demonstrating efficacy specifically in sarcopenia (Campelj et al., 2020, pp. 1–3; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The translation of efficacy from other muscle-wasting conditions to age-related sarcopenia is plausible but remains to be validated in targeted clinical trials addressing the unique pathophysiological aspects of sarcopenia. In addition, while the hypothesis regarding the stabilization of SERCA and RyR1 is supported by the role of HSP70 in preserving SERCA function under oxidative stress, direct biochemical data on the modulation of these proteins by BGP-15 in aged myotubes are limited (Gehrig et al., 2012, p. 3; Nascimento et al., 2020, pp. 1–2). Furthermore, some studies in chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting have indicated paradoxical effects, including cytoskeletal remodeling and protein synthesis attenuation under certain conditions, which may warrant cautious interpretation when extrapolating to the sarcopenia context (Campelj et al., 2020, pp. 24–25). Finally, while BGP-15 has been shown to be safe in early phase clinical investigations for metabolic indications, comprehensive long-term safety and efficacy data in an elderly population, which is the primary target for sarcopenia treatment, are not yet available (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In summary, the therapeutic candidate BGP-15 represents a novel chaperone-mediated approach to treating sarcopenia, leveraging mechanisms that stabilize key calcium-handling proteins and promote cellular stress resilience through HSP induction. Its established efficacy in related muscle-wasting disease models, alongside favorable pharmacokinetics and safety profiles from early clinical studies, underscore its potential. Nonetheless, the lack of direct clinical evidence in sarcopenia and incomplete mechanistic data regarding its interaction with specific SR proteins (SERCA and RyR1) call for further preclinical research and well-designed clinical trials to validate its efficacy in aging muscle (Campelj et al., 2020, pp. 22–24; Nascimento et al., 2018, pp. 1–2; Pető et al., 2020, pp. 8–10; Terrell et al., 2023, pp. 6–7).

Synthetic DWORF peptide (catalog custom synthesis),"Proposal for Synthetic DWORF peptide (catalog custom synthesis)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Synthetic DWORF peptide is based on the naturally occurring DWORF micropeptide, a 34–35 amino acid regulator originally discovered within a transcript that was previously annotated as a long noncoding RNA (Nelson et al., 2016). This micropeptide has been identified endogenously in cardiac and slow‐twitch skeletal muscle, where it localizes to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane and acts as a direct activator of the SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase) pump. As a therapeutic candidate, synthetic DWORF is a small peptide product, custom-synthesized in a laboratory setting and belonging to the class of peptide-based therapeutics. Peptide therapeutics have been broadly used to modulate protein–protein interactions by mimicking or inhibiting endogenous regulators; examples include inhibitors of signaling protein interactions and peptide hormones. In this case, the synthetic DWORF peptide seeks to recapitulate the endogenous activity of DWORF by binding to SERCA and displacing its inhibitory partners, phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) (Fisher et al., 2021; Bonilauri & Dallagiovanna, 2022). This candidate has gained attention through genetic validation in animal models via gene therapy approaches, and the advantage of a synthetic peptide modality is that it avoids the potential risks associated with viral vectors, while still leveraging the proven mechanistic benefits of increasing SERCA activity.

Therapeutic History:
The endogenous DWORF peptide has been studied extensively in the context of improving cardiac performance. Preclinical models have demonstrated that DWORF overexpression in the heart via gene therapy enhances SERCA activity, restoring calcium reuptake dynamics and improving contractility in models of dilated cardiomyopathy (Makarewich et al., 2018; Morales et al., 2023). Biochemical studies have shown that DWORF increases the maximal activity (Vmax) of SERCA by nearly 1.7-fold without altering its calcium affinity (Fisher et al., 2021). Although most of the direct therapeutic application evidence comes from cardiac models, the mechanistic underpinnings are highly relevant to skeletal muscle function as well. In skeletal muscle, impaired SERCA function is a key contributor to conditions such as sarcopenia, an age-related loss of muscle mass and function that has been linked to disrupted calcium homeostasis (Li et al., 2025). To date, there is no documented clinical use of synthetic DWORF peptide in sarcopenia; however, the repurposing concept is built upon a strong biochemical foundation. Prior research involving SERCA modulation via genetic manipulation of its endogenous regulators (PLN, SLN, and DWORF) has shown that relieving inhibition or directly activating SERCA can improve calcium cycling and muscle function (Nelson et al., 2016; Cleary et al., 2022). Thus, the historical use in cardiac muscle models, combined with analogous mechanisms in skeletal muscle, supports the rationale for exploring synthetic DWORF peptide in sarcopenia.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, DWORF directly interacts with SERCA by binding within its inhibitory groove and displacing endogenous inhibitors such as phospholamban and sarcolipin. Detailed biochemical studies using reconstituted membrane assays have demonstrated that DWORF increases the maximal catalytic activity (Vmax) of SERCA by approximately 1.7-fold while leaving the calcium affinity (KCa) unchanged (Fisher et al., 2021). This effect contrasts dramatically with that of inhibitory regulators such as PLN, which lower calcium affinity when bound to SERCA (Cleary et al., 2022; Fisher et al., 2021). Furthermore, structural and molecular dynamics simulations have revealed that DWORF possesses a unique structure—a helix-linker-helix conformation with a proline-induced kink in its transmembrane domain—that prevents it from exerting inhibitory contacts with SERCA. Instead, DWORF stabilizes conformations of SERCA that are associated with elevated calcium (Fisher et al., 2021; Rathod et al., 2021). This selective binding is calcium-dependent, such that DWORF preferentially interacts with SERCA when cytosolic calcium is high, which is during the contraction phase, thereby facilitating rapid calcium reuptake during relaxation. By displacing inhibitory peptides (PLN and SLN), which normally act to decrease SERCA efficiency, DWORF effectively reestablishes rapid calcium transient clearance. The detailed interactions include specific contacts with transmembrane segments of SERCA and depend on key residues within DWORF; for example, the proline residue at position 15 is critical for its function, as its mutation abolishes the effect (Fisher et al., 2021; Nelson et al., 2016). Thus, the biochemical mechanism is robust, targeting the regulatory interfaces of SERCA and enhancing its activity in a manner that is both direct and efficient.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for using synthetic DWORF peptide in aged myotubes and, by extension, in patients with sarcopenia, is that exogenous administration of the peptide will replicate the effects observed via gene therapy or endogenous overexpression. In the proposed assays, synthetic DWORF peptide is expected to bind SERCA in the membranes of aged skeletal muscle fibers, displacing inhibitory regulators such as PLN and SLN. This displacement should lead to enhanced SERCA-mediated calcium uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, reduced cytosolic calcium overload, and restoration of rapid calcium transient clearance—key factors that are typically compromised in sarcopenia (Li et al., 2025; Bonilauri & Dallagiovanna, 2022). Improved calcium dynamics will likely translate into better muscle contractility, reduced fatigue, and potentially a delay or reversal of muscle atrophy associated with aging. This mechanism is particularly promising because it directly addresses the underlying calcium dysregulation that has been observed in aged muscle fibers. The expected biochemical effect is based on robust cellular assays, such as those performed in HEK293 cardiomimetic cell systems, where overexpression of DWORF resulted in increased endoplasmic reticulum calcium load and uptake rates (Fisher et al., 2021). Given that SERCA isoforms (e.g., SERCA1 in skeletal muscle and SERCA2a in cardiac muscle) are expressed in relevant tissues, delivering synthetic DWORF peptide should, in theory, enhance calcium cycling in these cells. This strategy also benefits from not requiring long-term genetic manipulations, as the peptide itself would function as a biological modulator upon administration.

Overall Evaluation:
The synthetic DWORF peptide candidate shows strong promise as a therapeutic approach for sarcopenia for several reasons. First, its mechanism of action is highly specific and well validated at the molecular level—by targeting the regulatory interaction between SERCA and its endogenous inhibitors, DWORF directly enhances calcium handling, which is fundamental to muscle contractility (Fisher et al., 2021; Nelson et al., 2016). Second, the biological rationale is supported by extensive biochemical and cellular evidence in cardiac models, and the fundamental aspects of SERCA regulation appear conserved in skeletal muscle (Bonilauri & Dallagiovanna, 2022; Li et al., 2025). Third, using a synthetic peptide avoids complications associated with gene therapy vectors (e.g., viral vector risks) and can be precisely dosed, potentially leading to a better safety profile. However, there are also weaknesses to consider. Although preclinical cardiac studies have provided robust data, direct evidence in aged skeletal muscle or sarcopenia models is currently limited; thus, further research will be needed to establish efficacy in this context (Ochoa et al., 2023). Additionally, the delivery method, bioavailability, and stability of the synthetic peptide in vivo remain significant challenges that have not yet been fully addressed in the literature. There is also the potential risk that excessive activation of SERCA could disturb calcium homeostasis further by promoting calcium overload in the sarcoplasmic reticulum if not tightly controlled (Fisher et al., 2021; Cleary et al., 2022). Overall, however, the mechanistic specificity, the robust molecular data supporting increased SERCA activity, and the potential advantages of avoiding gene therapy techniques make synthetic DWORF peptide a compelling candidate for further investigation in the treatment of sarcopenia. Further preclinical studies focusing on aged myotubes and animal models of muscle aging will be critical to assess safety, optimize dosing, and establish efficacy before clinical translation can be considered.

IA-65 (ORAI1 agonist),"Proposal for IA-65 (ORAI1 agonist)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
IA-65 is a small, cell‐permeant synthetic molecule identified through high‐throughput screening efforts aimed at discovering potentiators of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) specifically mediated by the ORAI1 channel. Structurally described as 4-((5-phenyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)thiazol-2-yl)amino)benzoic acid, IA-65 belongs to a class of synthetic small-molecule modulators that target ion channels and regulate Ca²⁺ influx. Its design reflects an innovative strategy in drug development whereby prior screening campaigns were repurposed to identify compounds that selectively enhance ORAI1-mediated SOCE without significantly affecting related ORAI isoforms such as ORAI2 and ORAI3. This candidate is emerging from recent pharmacological efforts targeting the molecular machinery underlying Ca²⁺ homeostasis in skeletal muscle, and its synthesis likely involved medicinal chemistry optimization designed to improve cellular permeability, selectivity for ORAI1, and favorable in vitro ADME properties. Previous work in this class has predominantly focused on inhibitors of SOCE to counteract pathological Ca²⁺ overload; however, IA-65 represents a novel approach that aims to enhance rather than suppress Ca²⁺ entry, thereby addressing a mechanistic deficit observed in aging skeletal muscle (Lilliu et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
To date, the biochemical and pharmacological characterization of IA-65 has been performed primarily in heterologous expression systems as well as in vascular smooth muscle cells and skeletal muscle fibers ex vivo. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that IA-65 increases ORAI1-mediated Ca²⁺ currents in a concentration-dependent manner, with an effective concentration (EC₅₀) around 2 µM, and in rat skinned extensor digitorum longus (EDL) fibers, a concentration of 10 µM yielded an enhancement in Ca²⁺ influx by approximately 20–30%. Despite these promising in vitro and ex vivo findings, there is, at present, no record in the available literature of IA-65 being used in any clinical or veterinary setting, nor has it been directly tested in human subjects for sarcopenia or similar age-related muscle diseases. Moreover, broader therapeutic applications for this class of ORAI1 agonists remain largely experimental; although modulation of SOCE and specifically targeting the ORAI1 channel have been explored in muscle pathophysiology, previous studies have concentrated on inhibition rather than activation of these pathways, making IA-65 a novel candidate in its therapeutic approach. As such, while its potential for treating conditions related to deficient SOCE—such as sarcopenia—is theoretically sound, the translational research necessary for clinical validation is still in preliminary phases (Lilliu et al., 2021; Conte et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action for IA-65 is centered on its selective agonism of the ORAI1 channel, a critical component of SOCE in skeletal muscle. Under normal physiological conditions, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) stores Ca²⁺ that is released during muscle contraction via excitation–contraction (EC) coupling, primarily mediated by ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR1), with the consequent depletion of SR Ca²⁺ triggering activation of SOCE. In this regulatory circuit, STIM1 functions as a Ca²⁺ sensor in the SR; upon detecting Ca²⁺ depletion, STIM1 undergoes a conformational change, oligomerizes, and redistributes to regions near the plasma membrane or transverse tubules, where it physically interacts with the ORAI1 channel to gate its opening and allow extracellular Ca²⁺ influx. IA-65 enhances this process by binding selectively to ORAI1, thereby increasing the channel’s conductance and accelerating the rate of Ca²⁺ influx through SOCE. Importantly, IA-65 exhibits selectivity for ORAI1 without appreciable activation of ORAI2 or ORAI3 isoforms, which minimizes potential off-target effects associated with non-selective Ca²⁺ channel modulation. At the molecular level, the interaction of IA-65 with ORAI1 is thought to facilitate a conformational state akin to that produced by STIM1 activation, possibly stabilizing the open state of ORAI1 channels and accelerating calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI), which is a regulatory mechanism that prevents excessive Ca²⁺ influx during prolonged stimulation. The biochemical interactions underlying this modulation involve a precise binding of IA-65 to allosteric sites on ORAI1 that alter gating kinetics without disrupting the overall structural integrity of the channel complex. This mechanism aligns with the known biochemistry of SOCE, wherein a delicate balance between Ca²⁺ entry and inactivation is crucial for re-establishing Ca²⁺ homeostasis after muscle contraction and for safeguarding against Ca²⁺ toxicity (Lilliu et al., 2021; Conte et al., 2021; Michelucci et al., 2018).

Expected Effect:
In the context of aged human myotubes, the expected effect of IA-65 is to enhance ORAI1-mediated SOCE, thereby accelerating the refilling of SR Ca²⁺ stores following contraction. In skeletal muscle, efficient SR Ca²⁺ replenishment is paramount for sustaining subsequent Ca²⁺ transients that are vital for muscle contraction, particularly during repetitive or high-frequency stimulation. In aged muscle tissue, alterations in SOCE have been linked to diminished SR Ca²⁺ refilling, leading to a decrease in contraction amplitude and an increase in muscle fatigue—a hallmark of sarcopenia. By selectively potentiating ORAI1 currents, IA-65 is hypothesized to restore efficient Ca²⁺ influx, thereby overcoming the age-related deficits observed in SOCE. In preclinical studies, compromised SOCE resulting from impaired ORAI1 function has been associated with muscle weakness and fatigue, whereas enhancement of SOCE has been shown to improve muscle performance and fatigue resistance. Therefore, in an assay employing aged human myotubes, IA-65 would be expected to result in a measurable increase in the amplitude of Ca²⁺ transients following electrical stimulation, reflective of an increased rate of SR Ca²⁺ store refilling. This increased Ca²⁺ transient amplitude would, in turn, contribute to improved contractile function and resistance to fatigue over repeated contractions. The expression of ORAI1 in skeletal muscle is well documented, and its pivotal role in mediating SOCE in muscle fibers supports the hypothesis that targeting this channel could yield functional improvements in aged muscle cells (Conte et al., 2021; Dong & Maturana, 2025; Terrell et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, IA-65 emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia based on its mechanistic rationale and preclinical profile, yet several factors must be carefully considered.
Strengths:
• Mechanistic Specificity – IA-65 is designed to selectively activate ORAI1 and enhance SOCE, a pathway that is critically impaired in aged skeletal muscle. The specificity for ORAI1 over other isoforms like ORAI2 and ORAI3 minimizes the risk of unintended Ca²⁺ dysregulation in non-muscle tissues (Lilliu et al., 2021).
• Targeting a Validated Mechanism – The underlying hypothesis is predicated on robust preclinical evidence linking SOCE dysfunction to insufficient SR Ca²⁺ replenishment in aging and the resultant muscle fatigue observed in sarcopenia. Enhancing ORAI1 function directly addresses a fundamental deficit in aged muscle, potentially restoring Ca²⁺ transients and contractile function (Conte et al., 2021; Dong & Maturana, 2025).
• Innovative Channel Activation Approach – While many compounds act as SOCE inhibitors, IA-65 represents a unique approach by acting as an agonist to increase Ca²⁺ influx, which could be highly beneficial in conditions where reduced Ca²⁺ entry contributes to muscle weakness (Lilliu et al., 2021).
• Favorable In Vitro ADME Profile – Preliminary data indicate that IA-65 possesses favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties in vitro, potentially facilitating its translation from bench to bedside once further validated (Lilliu et al., 2021).

Weaknesses and Challenges:
• Limited Clinical Data – Despite promising preclinical findings, IA-65 has not yet been tested in clinical or veterinary settings. The lack of clinical trials or extensive in vivo data specifically examining its effects on muscle contraction and fatigue resistance in aged subjects presents a gap that must be addressed before further development (Lilliu et al., 2021).
• Risk of Calcium Overload – While enhancing Ca²⁺ influx through ORAI1 can be beneficial for SR refilling, excessive calcium entry could potentially lead to cytotoxicity or aberrant Ca²⁺ signaling, particularly given the fine balance required for normal muscle function. Appropriate dosing strategies and thorough preclinical toxicological studies are essential to mitigate this risk (Conte et al., 2021; Michelucci et al., 2018).
• Complex Regulation of SOCE – Skeletal muscle Ca²⁺ homeostasis is regulated by a network of proteins including STIM1, ORAI1, and TRPC channels, along with other Ca²⁺ handling proteins such as SERCA and calsequestrin. The potential for compensatory mechanisms or differential effects in various muscle fiber types may complicate the overall therapeutic impact of ORAI1 agonism (Conte et al., 2021; Terrell et al., 2023).
• Lack of In Vivo Efficacy Data – While in vitro studies suggest that IA-65 can enhance ORAI1-mediated Ca²⁺ currents, further studies in animal models of muscle aging are necessary to confirm that such enhancements translate into improved muscle function, increased endurance, and reduced fatigue in the context of sarcopenia (Dong & Maturana, 2025; Michelucci et al., 2018).
• Potential Off-Target Effects – Given that ORAI1 is expressed in various tissues including immune cells, there is a possibility that systemic administration of an ORAI1 agonist could have unintended effects in non-muscular tissues. This necessitates careful evaluation of tissue specificity and potential side effects during further drug development (Lilliu et al., 2021).

In summary, IA-65 represents an innovative and mechanism-based approach to treating sarcopenia by specifically enhancing ORAI1-mediated SOCE and thereby addressing the deficit in SR Ca²⁺ replenishment that contributes to muscle fatigue in the elderly. Its selective activation of ORAI1, favorable in vitro ADME properties, and the strong scientific rationale linking impaired SOCE to sarcopenia collectively support its further investigation as a therapeutic candidate. Nonetheless, the current limitations in clinical data, potential for calcium overload, and the inherent complexity of Ca²⁺ signaling in skeletal muscle underscore the need for comprehensive preclinical studies to validate its safety, efficacy, and long-term benefit in aged muscle models before advancing to clinical trials (Lilliu et al., 2021; Conte et al., 2021; Dong & Maturana, 2025). Overall, IA-65 holds promise as an innovative candidate targeting a validated sarcopenia mechanism, but its future as a repurposed therapeutic will require rigorous evaluation through detailed biochemical, in vivo, and eventually clinical studies.

Tocilizumab,"Proposal for Tocilizumab

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that was synthetically engineered via recombinant DNA technology. Its design involved grafting the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from a murine antibody targeting the human interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) onto a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) scaffold, resulting in a molecule with low immunogenicity and a high degree of specificity for both membrane-bound and soluble forms of IL-6R (Venkiteshwaran, 2009; Kishimoto & Nishimoto, 2008). Tocilizumab belongs to the class of biological response modifiers—in particular, it is an anti-cytokine biologic designed to disrupt cytokine signaling. This class of therapeutics has been widely used in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, chiefly rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), where blocking a proinflammatory cytokine leads to a significant abatement of disease symptoms (Tanaka et al., 2012).

Therapeutic History:
Tocilizumab has a well-established clinical history as an immunomodulatory agent. It was originally developed for treating rheumatoid arthritis and later expanded to indications such as Castleman’s disease and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Over the past decade, extensive clinical trials have confirmed its efficacy and safety profile in numerous autoimmune and inflammatory conditions (Kishimoto & Nishimoto, 2008; Sebba, 2008). Although its use has been predominantly in diseases with a clear inflammatory component, there has been emerging interest in exploring its potential utility for muscle wasting conditions. For instance, clinical trial searches with the terms “Tocilizumab AND (sarcopenia OR muscle wasting OR muscle strength OR aging muscle OR skeletal muscle)” have identified several ongoing investigations looking at the drug’s effects in contexts related to muscle mass and function (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Further, trials such as NCT02469896—investigating tocilizumab in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a disease marked by progressive muscle weakness—and NCT04687540—evaluating tocilizumab’s role in metabolic modulation—further underscore its potential to be repurposed beyond rheumatologic indications (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). However, despite these indications, tocilizumab has not yet been clinically established specifically for sarcopenia, and its direct application in treating age-related muscle loss remains investigational. Preclinical evidence in muscle wasting disorders such as cancer cachexia has been mixed, suggesting that while IL-6 signaling plays a role in muscle catabolism, single-agent IL-6 blockade may not reverse all aspects of muscle atrophy (Biswas & Acharyya, 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
Tocilizumab exerts its biological effect by competitively binding to both the soluble and membrane-bound forms of the IL-6 receptor. By doing so, it prevents the cytokine IL-6 from interacting with its receptor and initiating downstream signaling cascades. Under normal conditions, IL-6 binding to IL-6R leads to the recruitment of the signal-transducing protein gp130 and subsequent activation of Janus kinases (JAKs), which in turn phosphorylate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). The activated phospho-STAT3 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of genes involved in inflammation, acute-phase responses, and muscle protein catabolism (Tanaka et al., 2012; Venkiteshwaran, 2009).

The current hypothesis in the context of sarcopenia posits that chronic IL-6 elevation in aged individuals contributes to pathological activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway. This prolonged stimulation may induce an aberrant interaction between STAT3 and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). The ensuing cross-talk is thought to impair the function of critical proteins involved in excitation–contraction coupling, such as the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA). RyR1 is central to calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during muscle contraction, while SERCA is responsible for calcium reuptake during muscle relaxation. Dysregulation of these proteins can lead to instability of Ca²⁺ transients and thus compromise the contractile function of myotubes (Assyov et al., 2023). By binding to IL-6R, tocilizumab is expected to interrupt the upstream activation of this signaling cascade, thereby mitigating the downstream effects on STAT3, reducing the cross-talk with CaMKII, and ultimately restoring proper gating of RyR1 and normal expression and function of SERCA. These molecular interactions—which are supported by the well-characterized role of IL-6 in modulating the JAK/STAT pathway—form the basis for the proposal that tocilizumab may stabilize calcium transients and improve contractile function in aged muscle fibers (Tanaka et al., 2012; Biswas & Acharyya, 2020).

Expected Effect:
The proposal hypothesizes that administration of tocilizumab in aged myotubes will lead to a reduction in IL-6-driven inflammatory signaling, particularly within the JAK/STAT3 axis. Given the evidence that aged muscle is characterized by chronic, low-grade inflammation—often referred to as “inflammaging”—and that IL-6 levels are elevated in sarcopenic muscle, the expectation is that inhibiting this cytokine signal will result in several beneficial outcomes. First, by reducing STAT3 activation, there should be a decrease in the expression of catabolic genes and inflammatory mediators that contribute to muscle protein breakdown. Additionally, the suppression of STAT3 activation is anticipated to prevent or lessen the aberrant cross-talk with CaMKII, which is proposed to interfere with the normal function of calcium handling proteins. In essence, the expected outcome is a stabilization of the calcium transient during muscle contraction, mediated by corrected functioning of RyR1 and enhanced expression and/or activity of SERCA. This should translate into improved contractile function of the myotubes and, if these effects are reproducible in vivo, potentially preserve skeletal muscle mass and strength in aging individuals (Assyov et al., 2023; Tanaka et al., 2012). Importantly, the expression of IL-6 and its receptor in skeletal muscle, as well as the documented role of STAT3 in muscle atrophy, provides a strong biochemical rationale for expecting a beneficial effect. Although the specific interplay between STAT3, CaMKII, RyR1, and SERCA has not been exhaustively studied in the context of tocilizumab’s action on aged muscle, analogous studies with JAK inhibitors like tofacitinib have shown improvements in muscle remodeling and metabolic parameters, supporting the concept that upstream blockade of IL-6 signaling could yield similar outcomes (Bermejo-Álvarez et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Tocilizumab presents several compelling strengths as a candidate for repurposing in the treatment of sarcopenia. One of its primary advantages is the well-documented and robust clinical experience in managing various inflammatory conditions. Its safety and pharmacokinetic profiles are well established, which reduces the uncertainty and risk associated with drug repurposing. Mechanistically, the drug’s capacity to block IL-6-mediated JAK/STAT signaling is clearly supported by a broad body of literature (Venkiteshwaran, 2009; Tanaka et al., 2012). Given that chronic inflammation and elevated IL-6 levels are recognized contributors to sarcopenia, there is a solid biochemical rationale for testing tocilizumab in this context. Moreover, the novel aspect of the hypothesis is its focus on the cross-talk between STAT3 and CaMKII and the consequent effects on RyR1 gating and SERCA expression. If substantiated, this mechanism would not only reduce muscle catabolism but also directly improve the excitation–contraction coupling machinery, thereby enhancing muscle contractile function.

However, there are important weaknesses and gaps that temper the enthusiasm for immediate clinical application. First, while the role of IL-6 in driving muscle wasting is well documented in cachexia and other inflammatory diseases (Biswas & Acharyya, 2020; Rounis et al., 2022), direct evidence linking IL-6 blockade with improved muscle strength in age-related sarcopenia is still limited. Most clinical experience with tocilizumab has been in the context of rheumatoid arthritis and related conditions, rather than in primary muscle degenerative disorders. Furthermore, the precise hypothesis that tocilizumab modulates STAT3/CaMKII cross-talk affecting RyR1 and SERCA is intriguing but remains largely speculative without direct experimental confirmation. Although studies with other agents targeting the IL-6/JAK/STAT axis (e.g., tofacitinib) provide indirect support (Bermejo-Álvarez et al., 2023), more targeted research is needed to validate this proposed mechanism in aged myotubes. Additionally, the complexity of muscle physiology in aging encompasses multifactorial processes, including hormonal changes, altered mitochondrial function, and neuromuscular junction deficits, which may not be fully addressed by IL-6 blockade alone.

Another consideration is the potential risk associated with systemic IL-6 inhibition. Despite Tocilizumab’s acceptable safety profile in autoimmune conditions, long-term suppression of IL-6 signaling in elderly patients—who are often more vulnerable to infections and other immune challenges—requires careful evaluation. Drug repurposing in a population with sarcopenia might pose unique risks that need to be balanced against the potential benefits.

Overall, while the mechanistic rationale for repurposing tocilizumab for sarcopenia is supported by extensive literature on IL-6’s role in inflammation and muscle catabolism (Tanaka et al., 2012; Assyov et al., 2023), the hypothesis regarding its effects on calcium handling via STAT3/CaMKII cross-talk with downstream impacts on RyR1 and SERCA remains to be directly demonstrated. Tocilizumab’s long clinical track record in managing inflammatory diseases is a significant strength; however, the absence of direct clinical data in sarcopenia and the complexity of age-related muscle degeneration necessitate further preclinical and early-phase clinical studies before fully committing to this repurposing strategy. In conclusion, Tocilizumab is a promising therapeutic candidate whose established anti-inflammatory action makes it an attractive option to mitigate the chronic inflammation implicated in sarcopenia. However, additional mechanistic and clinical validation is required to confirm that its use will indeed stabilize calcium transients and improve contractile function in aged muscle, as hypothesized (Assyov et al., 2023; Bermejo-Álvarez et al., 2023).

FKBP12.6-mimetic peptide (Peptide sequence FRLCLARK),"Proposal for FKBP12.6-mimetic peptide (Peptide sequence FRLCLARK)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
The candidate under evaluation is a synthetic peptide based on a 10–amino acid FKBP12.6-mimetic sequence, specifically incorporating the FRLCLARK motif. This peptide has been rationally designed to mimic the binding properties of the endogenous FKBP12.6 protein—a small immunophilin that normally stabilizes ryanodine receptors (RyRs) by binding them and maintaining their closed state. FKBP12.6 is known to be a critical regulator of intracellular Ca²⁺ release channels, and in skeletal muscle, stabilization of RyR1 by FKBP12 (or by similar mimetics) is essential for maintaining controlled Ca²⁺ release during excitation–contraction coupling. The synthetic peptide belongs to a class of therapeutic agents that utilize peptide‐based mimetics to replicate the interaction interfaces of endogenous regulatory proteins. This category has been extensively explored relative to small molecule “Rycal” compounds (such as S107) that have demonstrated capacity for correcting pathological Ca²⁺ leak by enhancing the association of FKBP with RyRs in preclinical models (Andersson et al., 2011). Moreover, this peptide is engineered with cell‐penetrating capabilities to allow intracellular delivery, which is a critical aspect since the therapeutic target is the oxidized RyR1 complex in aged human myotubes (Andersson et al., 2011).

Therapeutic History:
The use of FKBP-based therapeutic mimetics is rooted in extensive biochemical and pharmacological research on RyR stabilization. Prior studies have shown that small molecules known as Rycals, like S107 (a Rycal analog), can mitigate the abnormal Ca²⁺ leak originating from oxidized and destabilized RyR1 channels in aged muscle, thereby improving muscle contractility, mitochondrial function, and exercise capacity in aged mouse models (Andersson et al., 2011; Marks, 2023). Although traditional Rycals are small molecules, the concept of directly replacing the lost stabilizing effect of FKBP by using synthetic FKBP-mimetic peptides—specifically ones based on sequences such as FRLCLARK—has been proposed as an alternative, more targeted approach (Dong & Maturana, 2025). To date, FKBP12.6-mimetic peptides have been explored in preclinical contexts to bind RyR regulatory sites in vitro, effectively reproducing some of the Rycal effects observed with small molecule interventions in both cardiac and skeletal muscle models (Marks, 2023; Kreko-Pierce et al., 2016). There is no direct clinical trial record for FKBP12.6-mimetic peptides for sarcopenia, as searches on ClinicalTrials.gov have returned no results for this specific candidate, highlighting that their application remains within the preclinical and investigative stage (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In parallel, the extensive work on RyR stabilization in models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and age-related muscle weakness illustrates that restoring FKBP binding to RyR1 is a validated approach for ameliorating muscle dysfunction (Santulli & Marks, 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, the physiological maintenance of excitation–contraction coupling in skeletal muscle relies on the precisely regulated release of Ca²⁺ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through RyR1 channels. Endogenous FKBP12 (and its analog FKBP12.6) binds these channels to favor the closed state and prevent spontaneous Ca²⁺ leak. However, with aging, oxidative modifications including oxidation and nitrosylation of RyR1 lead to the dissociation of these stabilizing proteins, resulting in an increased open probability (Po), elevated Ca²⁺ spark frequency, and subsequent intracellular Ca²⁺ leak that contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and muscle weakness (Andersson et al., 2011). The proposed FKBP12.6-mimetic peptide, incorporating the FRLCLARK motif, is designed to dock onto the oxidized RyR1 in aged myotubes, functionally substituting for the lost or dissociated endogenous FKBP. By binding to the same regulatory sites on RyR1, the peptide is anticipated to stabilize the channel in a closed conformation and hence reduce pathological Ca²⁺ leak (Andersson et al., 2011; Marks, 2023). The mechanistic rationale is further supported by evidence from experimental models where compounds that enhance FKBP binding to RyR1—such as Rycal S107—were able to restore Ca²⁺ homeostasis, enhance Ca²⁺ transient amplitude, and improve muscle force generation (Santulli & Marks, 2015; Dong & Maturana, 2025). In addition, biochemical studies have elucidated that the molecular interactions between FKBPs and RyR channels involve a delicate allosteric modulation of channel gating, where proper FKBP occupancy ensures minimal baseline leak while permitting normal channel opening during excitation (Richardson et al., 2025; Lee et al., 2014). Therefore, replacing the natural stabilizing proteins with a peptide mimetic is predicted to restore the RyR1 conformation that minimizes leak through finely tuned inter-domain interactions (Andersson et al., 2011). Moreover, recent high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy studies have shed light on the binding interfaces of RyR channels with FKBP proteins, elucidating the potential docking sites that a mimetic peptide like FRLCLARK could target (Marks, 2023).

Expected Effect:
In the context of aged human myotubes—a cellular model of sarcopenia—the administration of a cell-penetrating version of the FKBP12.6-mimetic peptide is expected to have multiple beneficial effects. Primarily, by binding to oxidized RyR1 channels, the peptide is anticipated to restore the channel’s closed state at rest, thereby reducing the pathological Ca²⁺ leak that underlies disrupted calcium homeostasis in aging muscle (Andersson et al., 2011; Dong & Maturana, 2025). With reduced leak, the amplitude and stability of Ca²⁺ transients during muscle contractions are expected to improve, leading to enhanced excitation–contraction coupling and better force generation. This improvement in calcium handling is projected to have downstream effects on muscle cell metabolism and mitochondrial function; reduced Ca²⁺ leak is associated with decreased mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overload, lower production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and improved mitochondrial membrane potential, all of which are critical parameters in sustaining muscle health and function (Andersson et al., 2011; Michelucci et al., 2021). Additionally, restoring controlled Ca²⁺ transients can activate anabolic signaling pathways, such as mTORC1, which underlie protein synthesis and muscle maintenance—a pathway that has been shown to be beneficial in responding to low-dose rapamycin-like interventions that modulate FKBP interactions (Lee et al., 2014). Since FKBP12 and its stabilization of RyR1 have been genetically validated in RyR1 leak models (Andersson et al., 2011), it follows that the synthetic replacement with an FKBP12.6-mimetic peptide is likely to recapitulate these effects, resulting in improved muscle contractility, reduced fatigue, and mitigation of sarcopenia-associated muscle wasting. Importantly, the gene expression of RyR1 in skeletal muscle has been consistently confirmed, ensuring that the proposed target is relevant to the cell type under investigation (Marks, 2023; Michelucci et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
The FKBP12.6-mimetic peptide candidate based on the FRLCLARK sequence offers a novel and promising therapeutic approach for sarcopenia. One of its primary strengths lies in its targeted mechanism: by directly binding to oxidized RyR1 channels, the peptide has the potential to restore the physiological closed state of the channel, thereby reducing pathological Ca²⁺ leak that underlies much of the muscle weakness observed in aged muscle tissues (Andersson et al., 2011; Marks, 2023). This mechanism is supported by extensive preclinical research that has validated the role of calstabin (FKBP) dissociation in the etiology of RyR1-mediated muscle dysfunction in aging and disease (Santulli & Marks, 2015; Dong & Maturana, 2025). By emulating the action of FKBP12 or FKBP12.6, the peptide may combine the beneficial effects observed with Rycal compounds and FKBP ligands while offering improved specificity due to its peptide nature and design. Furthermore, the cell-penetrating formulation can ensure intracellular target engagement, which is paramount given that the target, RyR1, is located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum of myotubes (Lee et al., 2014; Andersson et al., 2011).

However, there are several challenges and weaknesses associated with this therapeutic candidate. First, while the biochemical rationale for replacing endogenous FKBP binding with a synthetic mimetic is strong, the in vivo pharmacokinetics and stability of such peptides can be problematic; peptides are typically susceptible to proteolytic degradation and may require chemical modifications or delivery systems to extend their half-life and ensure effective cellular uptake (Marks, 2023; Dong & Maturana, 2025). Additionally, the dynamic regulation of RyR1 by endogenous FKBP proteins is complex and context-dependent, with studies showing that partial FKBP occupancy can have biphasic effects on channel function (Richardson et al., 2025; Lee et al., 2014). This suggests that over-stabilization of RyR1 may inadvertently dampen necessary Ca²⁺ release events during muscle contraction, potentially leading to impaired excitation–contraction coupling if the dosing is not carefully calibrated. Moreover, while small molecule Rycals such as S107 have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models of muscle dysfunction, the translation of these effects to peptide mimetics remains to be conclusively demonstrated in rigorous in vivo studies (Andersson et al., 2011; Michelucci et al., 2021).

Another potential weakness is that the preclinical validation of FKBP12.6-mimetic peptides has mostly been confined to in vitro studies and animal models, with no current clinical trial record that directly addresses their efficacy in sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This gap in clinical research requires careful consideration during drug development because the complex interplay among oxidative modifications, mitochondrial dysfunction, and calcium handling in aged muscle may pose clinical challenges not fully recapitulated in preclinical models (Andersson et al., 2011; Meyer et al., 2021). Additionally, the potential immunogenicity of synthetic peptides must be thoroughly evaluated, as off-target immune responses could compromise both efficacy and safety.

Despite these challenges, the overall evaluation of the FKBP12.6-mimetic peptide candidate is promising. The rationale is strongly supported by a wide range of studies that have documented the detrimental effects of RyR1 Ca²⁺ leak in muscle aging and the benefits of restoring normal RyR1 function via enhanced FKBP binding (Andersson et al., 2011; Marks, 2023; Michelucci et al., 2021). The proposed mechanism—that the peptide docks to oxidized RyR1, replacing endogenous FKBP, reducing aberrant Ca²⁺ leak, and thereby stabilizing Ca²⁺ transients—addresses a fundamental pathological process in sarcopenia. The strategy also has the potential to synergize with other interventions that target mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, which are also hallmarks of aged muscle (Santulli & Marks, 2015; Dong & Maturana, 2025). In addition, the specificity of peptide–protein interactions may offer a higher degree of targeted efficacy with reduced systemic side effects compared to broader acting small molecule antioxidants or mTOR inhibitors (Lee et al., 2014; Andersson et al., 2011).

In conclusion, the FKBP12.6-mimetic peptide candidate based on the FRLCLARK sequence represents an innovative and mechanistically sound therapeutic approach for sarcopenia. Its strengths lie in its targeted molecular mechanism of action and the extensive preclinical evidence supporting the central role of RyR1 stabilization in mitigating Ca²⁺ leak and muscle weakness (Andersson et al., 2011; Marks, 2023). However, further work is needed to address the challenges of peptide delivery, stability, dosing precision, and in vivo validation in human-relevant models. Overall, this candidate is highly promising and merits continued investment in preclinical development and eventual early-phase clinical trials to investigate its efficacy and safety for treating sarcopenia (Kreko-Pierce et al., 2016; Dong & Maturana, 2025).

78-c (CD38 inhibitor),"Proposal for 78-c (CD38 inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
The compound 78-c, chemically designated as N-(4-(4-bromophenyl)thiazol-2-yl)acetamide, is a small‐molecule inhibitor designed to target the NADase activity of the enzyme CD38. This molecule belongs to the thiazolylacetamide class, which has been developed following a series of structure‐based medicinal chemistry efforts focused on blocking CD38’s enzymatic function. Its chemical structure is characterized by a thiazole ring linked to an acetamide moiety, further substituted with a bromophenyl group, which contributes to its high potency and selectivity for CD38. The synthesis of 78-c arises from multi‐step organic routes that include the formation of the thiazole core and subsequent functional group modifications to optimize its binding affinity for CD38’s catalytic pocket. Historically, compounds within this chemical class have been explored in various preclinical studies for their ability to modulate NAD+ metabolism, a pathway that is central to many aspects of cellular energy balance and aging. The small‐molecule nature of 78-c offers advantages in terms of oral bioavailability, tissue distribution, and the potential for fine‐tuning pharmacokinetic properties. This feature contrasts with biologics such as monoclonal antibodies, which, despite their success in oncology (for example, the targeting of CD38 in multiple myeloma with daratumumab), present challenges when considered for chronic indications like age‐related muscle degeneration (Tarragó et al., 2018; Chini et al., 2018; Zuo et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Over the past decade, the modulation of NAD+ metabolism has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy in addressing a variety of age‐related diseases, including metabolic syndrome, cardiac dysfunction, and, more recently, skeletal muscle dysfunction embodied by sarcopenia. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that increased CD38 activity is one key driver of age‐related NAD+ decline, and, accordingly, CD38 inhibition can restore NAD+ availability in various tissues. Notably, the small molecule 78-c has been characterized in rodent models and shown to effectively inhibit the NADase activity of CD38 with low nanomolar potency, leading to increased tissue NAD+ levels in liver, muscle, and cardiac tissues. In aged mice, treatment with 78-c has been associated with improvements in glucose tolerance, exercise capacity, and even cardiac performance; these improvements are linked to enhanced NAD+ pools and downstream activation of NAD+‐dependent enzymes such as SIRT1 (Tarragó et al., 2018). Despite these promising biochemical and physiological findings in rodent models, the literature search for clinical trials specifically targeting sarcopenia with CD38 inhibitors, including 78-c, has yielded no registered clinical studies (ClinicalTrials.gov). To date, while CD38 inhibitors have been explored in the context of metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular aging, their direct application for muscle wasting syndromes like sarcopenia remains in the preclinical stage. The use of small‐molecule CD38 inhibitors is also supported by other investigational studies that have demonstrated improved NAD+ bioavailability and associated renoprotection and cardioprotection, suggesting that repurposing these compounds for the treatment of sarcopenia is an attractive proposition given the shared underlying mechanism of age‐related NAD+ decline (Tarragó et al., 2018; Chini et al., 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
CD38 is a multifunctional ectoenzyme that primarily acts as an NAD+ hydrolase, degrading NAD+ into ADP‐ribose (ADPR) and nicotinamide (NAM), and also catalyzes the production of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a potent secondary messenger involved in calcium signaling. In aging tissues, CD38 expression and enzymatic activity are upregulated, leading to a marked decline in intracellular NAD+ levels. This reduction in NAD+ is critical because NAD+ serves as an essential cofactor for sirtuins, particularly SIRT1, a deacetylase involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, regulation of inflammation, and modulation of cellular stress responses. In skeletal muscle, SIRT1 activation is linked to improved mitochondrial function and can influence the acetylation status of key regulatory proteins, including SERCA2 (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2). SERCA2 plays a central role in calcium reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and thus in ensuring proper Ca2+ transient amplitude and muscle contractility. The mechanism of action of 78-c is predicated on its ability to bind reversibly, and with high affinity, to the catalytic site of CD38, thereby competitively inhibiting its NADase function. Detailed biochemical studies have shown that 78-c exhibits an uncompetitive inhibition mechanism with very low inhibitory concentration (IC50 values in the nanomolar range), which translates into the stabilization of intracellular NAD+ levels. Elevated NAD+ in turn enhances the activity of SIRT1, which is not directly inhibited by 78-c. Active SIRT1 promotes deacetylation of its downstream substrates, one of which is SERCA2. Deacetylation of SERCA2 is hypothesized to restore its function, improving the efficiency of Ca2+ reuptake into the SR and normalizing Ca2+ transients in aged myotubes. This multi‐layered biochemical cascade—from CD38 inhibition to NAD+ restoration, activation of SIRT1 and consequent modulation of SERCA2 activity—provides a coherent mechanistic rationale for the use of 78-c in treating sarcopenia (Chini et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Kitada et al., 2023; Foreman et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the anticipated effect of 78-c in an in vitro assay using aged human myotubes is the preservation or elevation of intracellular NAD+ levels. This outcome should be measured using NAD+ quantification assays, such as cycling assays or HPLC-mass spectroscopy, which have previously evidenced increased NAD+ levels in rodent tissues following treatment with 78-c. With higher NAD+ availability, SIRT1 activity is expected to be restored or enhanced. This activation should lead to the deacetylation of several SIRT1 substrates, including SERCA2. In muscle cells, proper SERCA2 function is indispensable for maintaining efficient SR Ca2+ reuptake. Consequently, one would anticipate that 78-c treatment will improve the kinetics of Ca2+ transients in aged myotubes, measurable via calcium imaging techniques such as fluorescent calcium indicators or electrophysiological recordings. The normalization of SR Ca2+ handling is critical because impaired Ca2+ reuptake is directly correlated with reduced muscle contractility and fatigue, hallmarks of sarcopenia. In this context, the compound is acting not only by preventing NAD+ depletion but also indirectly by ensuring that key regulators of muscle contraction, such as SERCA2, operate at optimal levels. The target protein SIRT1 is well-documented to be expressed in skeletal muscle and plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and metabolic function (Goody & Henry, 2018). By linking the restoration of NAD+ to improved Ca2+ handling via SIRT1-mediated regulation of SERCA2, 78-c is expected to mitigate the muscle weakness and atrophy characteristic of sarcopenia (Tarragó et al., 2018; Goody & Henry, 2018).

Overall Evaluation:
In our evaluation of 78-c as a therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia, several strengths and some potential weaknesses emerge from the literature. On the strength side, 78-c is a well-characterized small molecule that has demonstrated potent and specific inhibition of CD38's NADase activity. Its ability to elevate tissue NAD+ levels has been robustly documented in several preclinical rodent studies (Tarragó et al., 2018). The strategy of preserving NAD+ by blocking its depletion is fundamentally attractive because NAD+ is a central metabolic cofactor with widespread influence over mitochondrial function, redox balance, and cell signaling. By targeting CD38, 78-c indirectly supports SIRT1, a critical regulator of muscle metabolism and protein homeostasis. SIRT1 activation has been associated with improved mitochondrial biogenesis and enhanced muscle performance, making it a logical downstream target in studies of muscle aging. Additionally, improvements in Ca2+ handling via the modulation of SERCA2 deacetylation provide a direct mechanistic link between NAD+ restoration and enhanced muscle contractility; SERCA2 is well recognized as a determining factor in maintaining Ca2+ transients and proper muscle relaxation, phenomena that are impaired in sarcopenia (Chini et al., 2018; Kitada et al., 2023).

On the other hand, there are notable gaps and potential challenges. Despite promising preclinical data, there are no current clinical trials or direct clinical data demonstrating the efficacy of 78-c in treating sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov). Although the compound has been tested in rodent models and has exhibited favorable pharmacokinetics, its specific application in human skeletal muscle cells, particularly aged myotubes, remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, while the mechanism linking CD38 inhibition to improved NAD+ bioavailability and subsequent SIRT1 activation is compelling, the precise molecular determinants governing the deacetylation and functional modulation of SERCA2 remain less explicitly characterized in the literature. There is also the possibility of off-target effects; while 78-c appears highly selective for CD38 over related enzymes such as PARP1 and NAMPT, comprehensive toxicity profiles in longer-term studies or in other relevant tissues have not been fully established (Chini et al., 2018). Finally, given that muscle aging and sarcopenia are multifactorial disorders influenced by a plethora of pathways beyond NAD+ metabolism and Ca2+ handling – such as inflammatory cytokine signaling, oxidative stress, and satellite cell dysfunction – the therapeutic effectiveness of 78-c may ultimately require combination with other interventions or a multi-targeted approach.

Overall, 78-c appears to be a promising candidate from a mechanistic and biochemical standpoint. Its ability to gradually restore intracellular NAD+ levels by inhibiting CD38, thereby sustaining SIRT1 activity and promoting proper SERCA2 function, builds a strong scientific rationale for its potential use in reversing or mitigating sarcopenia-related muscle dysfunction. Given the robust preclinical evidence for improvements in NAD+ metabolism and muscle function in aged rodent models (Tarragó et al., 2018; Foreman et al., 2021), the translational prospects of 78-c merit further exploration. However, it is imperative to proceed with comprehensive studies in relevant muscle models, both in vitro and in vivo, to establish clear proof of concept in the context of sarcopenia, to assess safety in long-term administration, and to further characterize its efficacy in restoring muscle function and structure (Chini et al., 2018; Kitada et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov).

In summary, our comprehensive literature review indicates that 78-c is a highly promising therapeutic candidate for targeting sarcopenia through its novel mechanism of inhibiting CD38 to elevate NAD+ levels. This elevation is postulated to enhance SIRT1 activity, promote the deacetylation and optimal function of SERCA2, and thereby improve SR Ca2+ reuptake and Ca2+ transients in aged muscles. The preclinical data supporting this mechanism, along with the compound’s favorable pharmacokinetic profile and tractability as a small molecule drug, make it a strong candidate for further development. Nonetheless, the absence of clinical data and direct studies in sarcopenia-specific models underscore the need for additional research to validate these mechanisms in human muscle tissues and to assess potential off-target effects. Ultimately, 78-c represents a scientifically grounded, mechanistically innovative approach to combating sarcopenia, and its development should be pursued with rigorous preclinical and eventual clinical investigations (Tarragó et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov; Goody & Henry, 2018).

"SLN inhibitor Compound-X (e.g., salvigenin derivative)","Proposal for SLN inhibitor Compound-X (e.g., salvigenin derivative)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Compound-X is a novel small-molecule inhibitor that is proposed to target sarcolipin (SLN), a regulatory micropeptide of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA) pump in skeletal muscle. Compound-X is exemplified by a salvigenin derivative built upon a diarylheptanoid scaffold. Diarylheptanoids are naturally occurring compounds often derived from plant sources and have been widely studied for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and other pharmacomodulatory properties. Salvigenin, in particular, is a flavonoid-like structure with documented bioactivity in traditional medicinal systems, and chemical modifications of such entities have led to derivatives that show improved selectivity and potency for specific targets. In this candidate, the diarylheptanoid scaffold has been engineered to confer specificity toward SLN, rather than cross-reacting with other SERCA regulators such as phospholamban (PLN). This therapeutic candidate belongs to the class of small-molecule inhibitors designed to modulate the protein–protein interactions that govern the inhibitory regulation of SERCA by SLN. Historically, compounds from this chemical class have been used in drug development for diverse diseases by acting on regulatory proteins or enzymes, though their use as direct modulators of muscle calcium handling is a relatively novel application (Fajardo, 2016; Mareedu et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Although SLN inhibitors per se have not been extensively evaluated in clinical settings for sarcopenia, the overall concept of targeting SERCA regulators in muscular disorders has gained attention in recent years. Literature evidence shows that SLN is upregulated in muscle wasting conditions and age-related muscle dysfunction, where its inhibitory effects on SERCA exacerbate impaired calcium reuptake and subsequent muscle weakness (Fajardo, 2016). Preclinical genetic studies have demonstrated that deletion of SLN in mouse models improves SERCA activity, accelerates Ca²⁺ uptake, and enhances muscle relaxation kinetics (Tupling et al., 2011; Fajardo, 2016). Separately, SERCA activators like CDN1163 have been shown to restore SERCA function in aging muscle, further supporting the therapeutic strategy of relieving SERCA inhibition (Qaisar et al., 2020; Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). While Compound-X itself has not yet been reported in published clinical or veterinary studies, its repurposing as an SLN inhibitor aims to mimic the beneficial effects observed in SLN genetic ablation, but through pharmacological means. There is minimal direct clinical trial activity targeting sarcopenia via SLN inhibition, as reflected in the sparse results from ClinicalTrials.gov search and the low association score reported by the Open Targets Platform (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ochoa et al., 2023), indicating that this is an emerging and experimental therapeutic direction.

Mechanism of Action:
The prevailing hypothesis behind Compound-X is centered on its ability to bind directly to sarcolipin within aged myotubes. Under normal conditions, SLN interacts with SERCA in skeletal muscle, binding to specific transmembrane domains and maintaining the pump in an inhibited state by reducing its affinity for Ca²⁺. This inhibition results in decreased Ca²⁺ reuptake and prolonged cytosolic Ca²⁺ transients, which can lead to impaired muscle relaxation and altered metabolism (Shaikh et al., 2016; Trinh, 2013). Compound-X is designed to selectively bind SLN, thereby preventing its interaction with SERCA. By blocking this inhibitory interaction, the compound is intended to relieve the suppression on SERCA activity. The resultant effects would be a normalization or increase in SERCA’s Ca²⁺ uptake rates into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), restoration of proper calcium transient amplitudes during muscle excitation, and improved relaxation kinetics of the muscle fibers (Fajardo, 2016; Qaisar et al., 2020). At the molecular level, studies using biochemical assays have shown that mutations or deletions of SLN lead to enhanced SERCA function, improved mitochondrial calcium handling, and metabolic benefits in muscle tissue (Tupling et al., 2011; Fajardo, 2016). Compound-X, by virtue of its diarylheptanoid scaffold, is proposed to exhibit high selectivity for SLN and avoid unwanted effects on PLN, which has a distinct regulatory profile and is expressed predominantly in cardiac muscle (Shaikh et al., 2016). The selectivity is critical because while inhibition of SLN is expected to be beneficial in correcting age-associated Ca²⁺ reuptake deficits, inhibition of PLN might lead to adverse cardiac outcomes. Thus, the molecular interaction between Compound-X and SLN is anticipated to disrupt SLN’s conformation or block its critical binding interface with SERCA, leading to a disinhibition of SERCA function (Bak, 2020; Fajardo, 2016). Moreover, detailed biochemical investigations have shown that even single amino acid modifications in regulatory peptides like SLN affect SERCA kinetics, supporting the concept that small molecules—such as Compound-X—might achieve similar regulatory effects through precise molecular interactions (Shaikh et al., 2016; Bak, 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assays using aged myotubes, Compound-X is expected to yield several beneficial effects on calcium handling dynamics. First, by binding to SLN and preventing its inhibitory interaction with SERCA, Compound-X should elevate the rate of Ca²⁺ uptake into the SR. Preclinical genetic studies where SLN was deleted consistently demonstrated accelerated Ca²⁺ reuptake and improved muscle relaxation, conditions that are directly translatable to the expected outcomes of pharmacological SLN inhibition (Tupling et al., 2011; Fajardo, 2016). Second, the restoration of SERCA activity should lead to increased Ca²⁺ transient amplitude, ensuring that proper Ca²⁺ signaling is maintained during muscle contraction and relaxation cycles. This is particularly relevant in aged muscle fibers where SLN upregulation has been implicated in slowing calcium kinetics and impairing contractility (Li et al., 2025; Fajardo, 2016). Third, improved relaxation kinetics are anticipated, which would translate into faster recovery times between muscle contractions, thereby reducing fatigue and increasing overall muscle efficiency. Notably, literature that evaluates SERCA activity restoration via genetic deletion of SLN or administration of SERCA activators (such as CDN1163) provides compelling evidence that such strategies can mitigate age-related muscle atrophy and weakness, serving as a proof-of-concept for Compound-X’s mechanism (Qaisar et al., 2020; Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). Additionally, the fact that SLN expression is elevated in aging skeletal muscle—as shown by multiple studies—underscores the relevance of targeting SLN in this context (Fajardo, 2016; Li et al., 2025). Therefore, in an aged myotube assay, one would expect to observe biochemical markers such as increased SERCA ATPase activity, reduced cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels after contraction, enhanced Ca²⁺ uptake kinetics, and, ultimately, improved muscle cell contractility and endurance. These improvements in Ca²⁺ homeostasis are likely to translate into better muscle performance at the organismal level, thereby addressing key aspects of sarcopenia pathology (Fajardo, 2016; Qaisar et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall rationale for Compound-X as a therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia is scientifically compelling but remains preliminary given the current landscape of SLN research in muscle physiology. One of the major strengths of this candidate is its mechanism based on a well-documented biological phenomenon: SLN upregulation in aged skeletal muscle leads to inhibited SERCA function, and genetic ablation studies have clearly demonstrated that reducing SLN levels improves Ca²⁺ uptake and muscle function (Tupling et al., 2011; Fajardo, 2016). The selective targeting offered by the diarylheptanoid scaffold of salvigenin derivatives further strengthens the concept because it addresses a major concern of off-target effects on PLN, whose inhibition could lead to adverse cardiac activities (Shaikh et al., 2016). Furthermore, preclinical data in related models, such as the use of SERCA activators to prevent age-related muscle atrophy, indirectly support the potential benefits of relieving SLN-mediated inhibition (Qaisar et al., 2020; Xu & Van Remmen, 2021).

However, there are notable weaknesses and challenges to consider. First, the evidence for the clinical use of small-molecule SLN inhibitors in sarcopenia is very limited, with current literature predominantly emphasizing genetic approaches and SERCA activators rather than direct pharmacological SLN inhibition (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ochoa et al., 2023). This means that any proposed compound, including Compound-X, will need to undergo extensive validation both in vitro and in vivo. Second, SLN has been shown to play a dual role in muscle physiology. In certain contexts, SLN upregulation may be part of a compensatory protective mechanism that facilitates beneficial calcineurin signaling and muscle remodeling (Fajardo, 2016). Therefore, complete inhibition of SLN could theoretically blunt these adaptive responses, potentially leading to unanticipated adverse effects on muscle plasticity and regeneration. Third, compared to the extensive body of work on SERCA activators like CDN1163 in mitigating sarcopenia, the literature on SLN inhibitors is sparse; hence, the pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and safety profile of Compound-X remain largely investigational (Qaisar et al., 2020; Bak, 2020). Fourth, the effectiveness of Compound-X in aged tissues might be influenced by multiple age-associated factors such as oxidative modifications to SERCA itself, altered expression of other regulatory peptide partners (e.g., PLN), and generalized mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that SLN inhibition might need to be part of a combination therapy targeting several pathways simultaneously (Li et al., 2025; Fajardo, 2016).

In conclusion, Compound-X, as an SLN inhibitor based on a salvigenin derivative with a diarylheptanoid scaffold, represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia. Its mechanism of action—disrupting the inhibitory interaction between SLN and SERCA to restore Ca²⁺ handling—addresses a key pathological mechanism implicated in age-related muscle dysfunction. The scientific rationale is underpinned by robust preclinical genetic studies and biochemical findings demonstrating that reduction of SLN activity improves SERCA function and muscle performance (Tupling et al., 2011; Fajardo, 2016). Nonetheless, before pursuing further development, additional research is required to validate the efficacy, selectivity, and safety of Compound-X in both in vitro aged myotube models and in vivo sarcopenia models. Particular emphasis should be placed on determining whether SLN inhibition might interfere with adaptive muscle remodeling pathways, as well as on conducting comprehensive pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies. Overall, while Compound-X is scientifically promising, its translation into an effective therapeutic option for sarcopenia will depend on overcoming these challenges through rigorous preclinical evaluation and eventual clinical trials (Fajardo, 2016; Shaikh et al., 2016; Qaisar et al., 2020).

"PS Compound 5 (from Luraghi et al., J Med Chem 2022)","Proposal for PS Compound 5 (from Luraghi et al., J Med Chem 2022)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
PS Compound 5 is a small molecule originally optimized by Luraghi et al. (Unknown Reference) for activation of SERCA2a in cardiac muscle. It belongs to the class of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase (SERCA) activators, a group of compounds designed to enhance the activity of these ion pumps. The SERCA pumps are responsible for the critical task of sequestering cytosolic Ca²⁺ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), hence promoting proper contractile–relaxation cycles in muscle tissues. Originally developed for cardiac applications, where enhanced Ca²⁺ reuptake into the SR can improve contractility and energy efficiency, PS Compound 5 is now being hypothesized for repurposing in sarcopenia. Its chemical scaffold appears amenable to further optimization to selectively activate SERCA2b in skeletal muscle cells. In the context of skeletal muscle aging, SERCA2b is essential for maintaining Ca²⁺ homeostasis, as disruptions in its activity are associated with weakened contractile function and reduced muscle performance (Velez & Jesus, 2018; Mina, 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Although PS Compound 5 has been primarily studied in the context of its cardiac applications—including demonstration of target engagement in diabetic rats with excellent safety margins (LD₅₀ > 800 mg/kg oral)—its proposed repurposing for sarcopenia has not yet transitioned into advanced preclinical or clinical investigations specific to skeletal muscle. The broader SERCA activator class has been probed in various contexts; for example, other compounds such as CDN1163 have been used in mechanistic studies to restore Ca²⁺ handling in neuronal models of Wolfram syndrome (Liiv et al., 2024) and have known implications for improving cellular bioenergetics. Additionally, clinical trial searches using terms related to ATP2A2, SERCA2, and Ca²⁺ homeostasis in skeletal muscle have identified studies addressing related pathways in muscle dysfunction, yet none have provided direct evidence of PS Compound 5 efficacy or safety in conditions such as sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Historically, compounds targeting SERCA modulation have been more explored in cardiac or neuronal systems rather than in skeletal muscle aging; however, emerging evidence from studies on muscle metabolism and calcium handling—such as those detailing SERCA’s role in excitation–contraction coupling (Velez & Jesus, 2018) and the impact of dysregulated Ca²⁺ signaling on muscle fatigue (Sopariwala et al., 2015)—provides a rationale for considering such agents in sarcopenia. To date, there is no published clinical history of any SERCA2b-selective activator being used directly in sarcopenic patients or models of muscle atrophy, highlighting a gap but also an opportunity for further investigation (Velez & Jesus, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, SERCA pumps operate by using the energy from ATP hydrolysis to transport Ca²⁺ from the cytosol into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum, thereby lowering cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentrations and replenishing the intracellular Ca²⁺ stores required for subsequent muscle contraction. SERCA2b, the ubiquitously expressed isoform found in both cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscle, differs from the SERCA2a isoform by its higher Ca²⁺ affinity and distinct regulatory interactions. This isoform is particularly critical in aged skeletal muscle, where disrupted Ca²⁺ handling is implicated in decreased contractility and increased muscle fatigue (Mina, 2023; Velez & Jesus, 2018). PS Compound 5 is hypothesized to activate SERCA2b by binding to and stabilizing a conformation of the pump that favors efficient Ca²⁺ uptake. Structural analyses from related studies suggest that small molecule activators can interact with the transmembrane domains of SERCA—possibly near regions influenced by redox regulation or by interactions with endogenous regulators such as phospholamban—and shift the delicate equilibrium of the pump’s conformational states towards the active E1 state, thereby increasing the turnover rate of Ca²⁺ transport (Liiv et al., 2024). This activation should result in enhanced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ uptake rates, decreased cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentrations, and improved fidelity of Ca²⁺ transients, which are vital for sustained and robust muscle contraction. The existing literature supports the notion that improving SERCA function in muscle cells can lead to better Ca²⁺ homeostasis, as evidenced by studies in which SERCA overexpression or activation restored proper Ca²⁺ dynamics in disease models characterized by impaired Ca²⁺ handling, including Wolfram syndrome (Liiv et al., 2024). Additionally, studies emphasizing the modulation of SERCA by endogenous regulators such as sarcolipin (Sopariwala et al., 2015) reaffirm the centrality of SERCA activity in muscle energetics and contractile function. PS Compound 5 is thus expected to function through a similar mechanism, albeit with greater selectivity and potency tailored toward aged skeletal muscle cells.

Expected Effect:
In the context of an assay using aged skeletal myotubes, the expected pharmacological action of PS Compound 5 is to robustly activate SERCA2b at nanomolar concentrations. By enhancing the rate of Ca²⁺ uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the compound is anticipated to lower the pathological levels of cytosolic Ca²⁺ that are commonly seen in sarcopenia and contribute to impaired muscle contractility. This reduction in cytosolic Ca²⁺ would restore the amplitude and timing of Ca²⁺ transients needed for proper excitation–contraction coupling, thus potentially reversing aspects of muscle weakness associated with aging (Velez & Jesus, 2018; Mina, 2023). Given that SERCA2b is endogenously expressed in slow-twitch muscle fibers which are particularly affected during the progression of sarcopenia (Velez & Jesus, 2018), the compound’s mechanism—by reducing Ca²⁺ overload and normalizing Ca²⁺ kinetics—could also improve mitochondrial function. Enhanced Ca²⁺ handling in the SR is linked to improved mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation since Ca²⁺ plays a role in activating key dehydrogenases in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Liiv et al., 2024; Mina, 2023). Moreover, the compound’s excellent pharmacokinetic profile reported in diabetic rat models supports the feasibility of achieving sustained target engagement in vivo, which is critical for clinical translation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Therefore, in cell-based assays, one would expect PS Compound 5 to increase SR Ca²⁺ uptake rates, ultimately leading to more efficient cytosolic Ca²⁺ clearance, restoration of Ca²⁺ transient fidelity, and subsequent improvement in muscle contractile performance. This anticipated effect is predicated on a well-established understanding of SERCA’s role in muscle physiology and the necessity of maintained Ca²⁺ homeostasis for muscle fiber health (Velez & Jesus, 2018; Liiv et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of PS Compound 5 as a potential repurposed therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia reveals several promising strengths but also highlights critical areas that require extensive further study. One major strength is the compelling mechanistic rationale provided by the fundamental role of SERCA2b in maintaining Ca²⁺ homeostasis in skeletal muscle. Literature indicates that interventions aimed at enhancing SERCA activity can restore proper Ca²⁺ handling and improve muscle energetics, as seen in models of related disorders (Velez & Jesus, 2018; Liiv et al., 2024). PS Compound 5’s reported high nanomolar potency and favorable safety profile in preclinical studies (with an LD₅₀ greater than 800 mg/kg orally reported in diabetic rat studies) support the notion that its pharmacological modulation of SERCA activity could be clinically translatable (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, its structural scaffold, which was initially optimized for SERCA2a, is believed to be adaptable to potent activation of the SERCA2b isoform prevalent in slow-twitch skeletal fibers, addressing one of the crucial deficits observed in aged muscle.

However, the weaknesses are also significant. Despite the attractive hypothesis, the current literature does not provide direct biochemical, preclinical, or clinical data to demonstrate that PS Compound 5 specifically activates SERCA2b in aged skeletal myotubes. Many of the referenced studies, such as those by Liiv et al. (Liiv et al., 2024) and reports on SERCA function in neuronal models, focus primarily on neurological or cardiac applications rather than skeletal muscle. Furthermore, clinical trials investigating SERCA modulators to improve muscle function in sarcopenia have yet to yield detailed results that can be directly extrapolated to support the efficacy of PS Compound 5 in this new indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

The translational gap also includes uncertainties about tissue selectivity, as the compound was originally optimized for cardiac SERCA2a and not developed with skeletal muscle in mind. This raises important questions regarding its pharmacodynamic behavior in skeletal tissue, such as whether its activation of SERCA2b in skeletal myotubes will be as robust and selective as hypothesized, and how it may interact with endogenous regulatory proteins that differ between cardiac and skeletal muscle (Mina, 2023; Velez & Jesus, 2018). Additionally, while the exceptional oral safety in diabetic rat models is encouraging, animal studies specific to sarcopenia or aged muscle models have not been reported; thus, the predictive validity of these safety and efficacy metrics for sarcopenia treatment remains to be fully established. Lastly, while improved Ca²⁺ transient fidelity is a reasonable biomarker for enhanced muscle function, comprehensive histological and functional assessments in relevant animal models of muscle atrophy will be essential to truly validate its therapeutic potential (Velez & Jesus, 2018; Liiv et al., 2024; Mina, 2023).

In conclusion, PS Compound 5 represents a highly intriguing candidate for repurposing as a sarcopenia therapeutic based on its strong mechanistic rationale and favorable preclinical pharmacology in non-skeletal muscle contexts. Nonetheless, significant gaps in the current literature—from direct evidence of SERCA2b activation in aged skeletal muscle to comprehensive in vivo efficacy and safety data in sarcopenia models—underscore the need for further targeted research. As such, while the candidate holds promise, its novel application for sarcopenia remains speculative until further rigorous biochemical, preclinical, and eventually clinical studies are conducted to validate its efficacy in improving muscle function through restoring Ca²⁺ homeostasis (Velez & Jesus, 2018; Liiv et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Chloroxine (Sigma-Aldrich C-9878),"Proposal for Chloroxine (Sigma-Aldrich C-9878)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Chloroxine, identified as Sigma-Aldrich C-9878, is a chlorinated hydroxyquinoline originally developed and utilized for its antimicrobial properties and belongs to the quinoline derivative class of compounds (Rebbeck et al., 2020). This chemical entity was originally synthesized for antibacterial applications, leveraging the inherent bioactivity of its quinoline core, which confers favorable pharmacokinetic properties including good tissue distribution and high oral bioavailability, attributes that have historically made quinoline derivatives useful as both anti‐infectives and, in some instances, modulators of other cellular processes (Rebbeck et al., 2020). Historically, the quinoline scaffold has been the subject of extensive medicinal chemistry efforts, with repurposing strategies increasingly being employed to explore its applications beyond antibacterial activity; in the context of muscle disorders, the novelty of chloroxine lies in its potential to modulate intracellular calcium handling by targeting protein–protein interactions, specifically the calmodulin (CaM)–RyR1 interface (Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023). The identification of chloroxine as a promising candidate emerged from secondary high-throughput screening approaches, notably using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assays designed to detect alterations in the binding dynamics of regulatory proteins around RyR1 (Rebbeck et al., 2020), and its quinoline core is considered to be a chemically versatile moiety that has been explored in a range of therapeutic contexts.

Therapeutic History:
Chloroxine’s primary historical use has been as an antibacterial agent with a well-documented safety profile for treating infections, but there is currently no evidence that it has been used clinically for treating sarcopenia or similar muscle degenerative diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Preclinical studies and secondary screening campaigns, such as those reported by Rebbeck et al. (2020), have demonstrated that compounds from the quinoline family, including chloroxine, can interact with components of the excitation–contraction coupling machinery, particularly by modulating RyR1 function, although these compounds have not yet been translated into clinical therapeutics for muscle weakness disorders (Rebbeck et al., 2020). In addition, the repurposing strategy for chloroxine is further supported by the broader trend in drug development to exploit compounds with known pharmacological profiles in novel therapeutic applications such as neuromuscular diseases and sarcopenia, where dysregulated calcium homeostasis is a key pathogenic mechanism (Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023). Nonetheless, while there is an emerging body of biochemical data supporting the role of quinoline derivatives in modulating RyR1-mediated Ca²⁺ leak in skeletal muscle fibers, there remains a notable gap in clinical literature directly linking chloroxine to benefits in sarcopenia or other age-associated muscle atrophies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanistic hypothesis for chloroxine in the context of sarcopenia is that it binds to the RyR1 calmodulin-interaction domain in aged myotubes, thereby enhancing and stabilizing the association of calmodulin with RyR1 (Rebbeck et al., 2020). At the molecular level, RyR1 is a critical calcium release channel in skeletal muscle, and its normal gating behavior is tightly regulated by accessory proteins including calmodulin and FKBP12 that stabilize the closed state of the channel under resting conditions (Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023). In diseased or aged muscle, disruptions in the calmodulin–RyR1 interaction can lead to pathological calcium leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), contributing to muscle weakness by impairing the amplitude and fidelity of Ca²⁺ transients during excitation–contraction (EC) coupling (Rebbeck et al., 2020). Structural insights obtained via cryo-electron microscopy and high-throughput screening approaches have underscored that FRET signal changes directly correlate with alterations in the calmodulin association with RyR1, suggesting that compounds which enhance calmodulin binding can effectively reduce pathological SR Ca²⁺ leak (Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023; Rebbeck et al., 2020). The biochemical rationale is that the quinoline structure of chloroxine may interact with the calmodulin-binding pocket of RyR1, either allosterically altering the conformation of the channel or directly stabilizing the binding of calmodulin, thereby reducing aberrant Ca²⁺ efflux from the SR and restoring calcium signaling fidelity necessary for proper muscle contraction (Rebbeck et al., 2020). Such a mechanism is distinct from broad channel pore blockers like tetracaine or dantrolene because it targets the regulatory protein–protein interface rather than the pore itself, potentially offering better specificity and fewer side effects by preserving normal excitation–contraction coupling (Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023; Rebbeck et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the experimental settings proposed by our research team, chloroxine is expected to exert a measurable reduction in SR Ca²⁺ leak in aged myotubes and skinned muscle fibers by enhancing the CaM–RyR1 interaction, which in turn should restore the amplitude and fidelity of Ca²⁺ transients during both basal and stimulated conditions (Rebbeck et al., 2020). Specifically, by binding to the RyR1 calmodulin-interaction domain, chloroxine is hypothesized to increase FRET efficiency in assays that monitor the binding of calmodulin to RyR1, which has been correlated with a concurrent decrease in [³H]ryanodine binding, a biochemical marker for channel open probability and Ca²⁺ leak (Rebbeck et al., 2020). In physiological terms, this stabilization is anticipated to lead to a reduction in pathological Ca²⁺ leak during the resting state of skeletal muscle while preserving the robust Ca²⁺ release required for effective excitation–contraction coupling during muscle activity (Rebbeck et al., 2020). Given that RyR1 is the predominant calcium channel in skeletal muscle fibers and is critically involved in the generation of Ca²⁺ transients, increasing calmodulin’s association with RyR1 by chloroxine is expected to normalize altered calcium homeostasis, thereby improving muscle contractile function and potentially ameliorating sarcopenia-related muscle weakness (Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023; Rebbeck et al., 2020). This effect would be particularly significant in aged muscle, where disruptions in calcium handling contribute to decreased force production, increased fatigue, and overall muscle atrophy.

Overall Evaluation:
Chloroxine represents an innovative therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia by reengineering a well-known antibacterial agent into a modulator of skeletal muscle calcium signaling. One of the key strengths of chloroxine lies in its favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including oral bioavailability and extensive tissue distribution afforded by its quinoline core, which have been well characterized in its historical use as an antimicrobial (Rebbeck et al., 2020). Its mechanism of action, as proposed by the current hypothesis, is particularly appealing because it focuses on the stabilization of the calmodulin–RyR1 interaction rather than directly blocking the channel pore; this level of mechanistic specificity could translate into effective suppression of pathological Ca²⁺ leak with minimal disruption of normal excitation–contraction processes (Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023; Rebbeck et al., 2020). Preclinical data derived from FRET-based high-throughput screening and functional assays on skinned skeletal muscle fibers support the potential of chloroxine to lower Ca²⁺ leak and modulate RyR1 activity, thereby addressing one of the central pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to muscle weakness in sarcopenia (Rebbeck et al., 2020).

However, several weaknesses and uncertainties remain. First, although the underlying hypothesis is well supported by preclinical screenings, there is a lack of direct clinical or extensive preclinical data demonstrating chloroxine’s efficacy in treating sarcopenia or related muscle disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Moreover, while the repurposing strategy benefits from an established safety profile in its antibacterial role, the off-target effects that could arise from its action on RyR1 and the potential for undesired interference in other tissues expressing ryanodine receptors (for example, cardiac muscle where RyR2 predominates) must be thoroughly evaluated (Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023; Rebbeck et al., 2020). There is also emerging evidence suggesting that modulation of RyR1 by similar compounds can yield complex outcomes, and data reported in some non-muscle cell lines have shown inconsistent effects of chloroxine, likely related to differences in regulatory protein expression and the absence of a fully functional excitation–contraction coupling apparatus (Beaufils et al., 2022). Additionally, while the FRET assay data and [³H]ryanodine binding studies provide compelling mechanistic insights, confirmation in physiologically relevant models of aged muscle remains essential to bridge the gap between in vitro screening and in vivo efficacy (Rebbeck et al., 2020).

In summary, the overall potential of chloroxine as a therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia is promising but remains in an early stage of validation. Its strengths lie in the novel mechanism of action targeting the calmodulin–RyR1 interaction, the repurposing of a compound with favorable pharmacokinetics, and supportive preclinical screening data that indicate its ability to reduce pathological Ca²⁺ leak in skeletal muscle fibers. However, the weaknesses include the absence of direct clinical evidence in the context of sarcopenia, the possibility of off-target effects, and the need for further research to elucidate detailed molecular interactions and confirm its efficacy in age-related muscle dysfunction models. Based on the current comprehensive literature review spanning biochemical, clinical, and preclinical domains, chloroxine merits further targeted investigation using rigorous in vitro and in vivo models to validate its mechanism and therapeutic effect for potential repurposing as a treatment for sarcopenia (Rebbeck et al., 2020; Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023).

Tautomycetin,"Proposal for Tautomycetin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tautomycetin is a natural product originally isolated from certain Streptomyces species and belongs to the polyketide family of compounds. It was first characterized as a novel antibiotic with immunosuppressive and anticancer properties, and subsequent studies demonstrated its potent and selective inhibition of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Its discovery emerged from traditional fermentation processes involving soil-dwelling Streptomyces strains, and its complex polyketide structure—which includes key moieties such as a maleic anhydride group—has been elucidated through extensive structural studies. Synthetic efforts have been advanced, with several groups synthesizing tautomycetin analogues in order to optimize its potency and selectivity for PP1, as well as to improve its pharmacological profile (Woydziak et al., 2021; Swingle & Honkanen, 2019). Compounds of this chemical class, natural product polyketides targeting phosphatases, have historically served as invaluable research tools for dissecting signal transduction pathways, and, in some cases, have shown potential for repurposing in disease states beyond their original antimicrobial or cytotoxic indications.

Therapeutic History:
Biochemically, tautomycetin has been predominantly used as a molecular probe to study the function of PP1, due to its remarkable selectivity compared to other serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors. Early studies highlighted that tautomycetin exerts potent PP1 inhibition at nanomolar concentrations in both cell-free systems and cultured cells. Its immunosuppressive and anticancer activities have been rigorously documented in preclinical settings, where low micromolar doses induced marked apoptosis in activated T cells and inhibited tumor cell proliferation (Niu et al., 2012). Despite the depth of biochemical and structural work, clinical applications of tautomycetin have been limited. Searches of clinical trial registries reveal that no studies have specifically tested tautomycetin or similar selective PP1 inhibitors in muscle aging or sarcopenia contexts (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). To date, tautomycetin has not been previously used clinically in sarcopenia or analogous chronic neuromuscular disorders; rather, its primary record lies within experimental settings in oncology and immunomodulation (Honkanen & Golden, 2002). Thus, while there is a robust body of biochemical and preclinical data demonstrating PP1 inhibition by tautomycetin, its repurposing for age-related muscle wasting remains untested in a clinical setting.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, tautomycetin is a highly selective inhibitor of PP1. PP1 is a ubiquitous serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a critical role in regulating many cellular processes through reversible dephosphorylation events. Tautomycetin exerts its action by binding within the catalytic active site of PP1, an interaction that is facilitated by its diacid moiety mimicking the phosphate group and its hydrophobic regions engaging with the enzyme’s hydrophobic groove. Detailed structural studies, similar to those performed for related compounds such as tautomycin, reveal that the binding of these inhibitors is stabilized via multiple hydrogen bonds, notably with key residues that are essential for PP1’s catalytic function (Swingle & Honkanen, 2019; Woydziak et al., 2021). In muscle cells, PP1 is known to regulate the phosphorylation state of several calcium-handling proteins, including the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) and phospholamban (PLN). RyR1 mediates the release of Ca²⁺ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during muscle contraction, whereas phospholamban modulates the activity of SERCA (the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase), a pump responsible for reuptaking Ca²⁺ into the SR during muscle relaxation. Under physiological conditions, a tightly controlled phosphorylation balance ensures proper regulation of these channels and pumps; however, dysregulated PP1 activity as observed in aging can lead to state changes wherein excess dephosphorylation may destabilize RyR1 and alter PLN’s regulatory inhibition of SERCA. Tautomycetin, by selectively inhibiting PP1, is hypothesized to sustain a dephosphorylated—and therefore stable—state of RyR1 and phospholamban, which would reduce pathological SR Ca²⁺ leak and enhance SERCA-mediated Ca²⁺ reuptake. This mechanism is postulated to lead to normalization of Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and clearance in aged myotubes, an effect that may alleviate one of the central biochemical disturbances in sarcopenia (Niu et al., 2012; Swingle & Honkanen, 2019; Bollen & Stalmans, 1992).

Expected Effect:
In the context of sarcopenia, aged muscle fibers are characterized by disrupted calcium homeostasis, often marked by increased Ca²⁺ leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via destabilized RyR1 channels and impaired Ca²⁺ reuptake due to suboptimal SERCA function. Dysregulated phosphorylation—where an imbalance in kinase and phosphatase activities alters the function of these critical regulators—has been implicated as a contributing factor to this phenomenon (Agrawal et al., 2018; Umanskaya, 2015). Tautomycetin’s role as a PP1 inhibitor is expected to intervene in this process by preserving appropriate phosphorylation states of both RyR1 and phospholamban in aged myotubes. Specifically, sustained dephosphorylation of RyR1 may enhance its stability, reducing the pathological diastolic leakage of Ca²⁺ from the SR. Concurrently, maintaining the dephosphorylated state of phospholamban should mitigate its inhibitory effect on SERCA in a controlled manner, thereby facilitating more efficient reuptake of Ca²⁺ into the SR. Together, these effects would restore the amplitude and clearance rate of Ca²⁺ transients closer to those observed in youthful and healthy muscle tissue (Terrell et al., 2023; Niu et al., 2012). Supporting this hypothesis, biochemical studies have shown that modulating the phosphorylation state of calcium handling proteins is critical for maintaining normal excitation–contraction coupling, and PP1 is a central player in these dephosphorylation events (Bollen & Stalmans, 1992; Honkanen & Golden, 2002). Furthermore, experiments in muscle cell models indicate that targeting the regulatory balance of these proteins can restore Ca²⁺ homeostasis and improve contractile function, which is directly relevant for counteracting the effects seen in sarcopenia (Agrawal et al., 2018).

Overall Evaluation:
Tautomycetin presents as an intriguing candidate for repurposing in the treatment of sarcopenia, primarily due to its ability to selectively inhibit PP1—a key enzyme implicated in the dysregulation of calcium handling in aging muscle. One of its major strengths lies in its mechanism of action; by precisely modulating PP1 activity, tautomycetin offers the potential to restore the delicate balance of phosphorylation on proteins such as RyR1 and phospholamban, thereby directly addressing the abnormal Ca²⁺ leak and impaired reuptake that underlie sarcopenia. Its well-documented biochemical activity at nanomolar concentrations in vitro, along with promising structural insights that support its selectivity, provide a solid foundation for further investigation (Swingle & Honkanen, 2019; Woydziak et al., 2021). The small-molecule nature of tautomycetin further enhances its appeal, as it typically enables easier formulation and potentially favorable pharmacokinetic properties, though comprehensive PK data specific to muscle tissue and long-term administration in chronic conditions such as sarcopenia will need to be established.

However, there are several notable weaknesses and challenges. Firstly, despite robust preclinical data in immunosuppression and cancer research, there is a striking lack of clinical trials or in vivo studies directly evaluating tautomycetin in the context of muscle aging or sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This absence of direct clinical evidence means that extrapolation of its efficacy from cell-based studies to therapeutic benefits in aged human muscle remains highly speculative. Furthermore, the potential toxicity of PP1 inhibitors must be carefully considered. While tautomycetin’s selective inhibition of PP1 is its primary strength, non-selective inhibition or excessive dosages may lead to adverse effects, particularly given PP1’s ubiquitous role in numerous cellular functions. Studies in animal models have indicated that compounds of this class, when administered at supra-physiological doses, can induce unwanted cytotoxicity and immunological side effects (Niu et al., 2012). Additionally, the intricate balance between kinase and phosphatase activities that regulate calcium handling proteins means that slight perturbations could have unpredictable downstream effects, potentially worsening muscle function if not precisely controlled (Honkanen & Golden, 2002).

Another concern is that the current literature focused on tautomycetin does not provide direct evidence of its beneficial effects on sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium handling in aging muscle. The hypothesis that tautomycetin can normalize Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and clearance by preserving dephosphorylated forms of RyR1 and phospholamban is supported primarily by biochemical rationale and indirect evidence from studies examining PP1 regulation in muscle signal transduction (Swingle & Honkanen, 2019; Bollen & Stalmans, 1992). Experimental validation in aged myotubes, animal models of sarcopenia, and ultimately human studies will be essential to confirm that the modulation of PP1 activity indeed translates into improved muscle function and reversal of sarcopenic changes.

Overall, tautomycetin’s well-characterized biochemical profile and its selective inhibition of PP1 position it as a promising candidate to modulate key calcium handling proteins in muscle. The therapeutic rationale is robust, as restoring proper Ca²⁺ homeostasis through improved stabilization of RyR1 and regulated phospholamban activity addresses a central mechanism implicated in sarcopenia. Yet, significant gaps remain regarding its translational potential. Preclinical studies specifically testing its efficacy in muscle aging models, comprehensive toxicology assessments, and detailed pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) evaluations are critical next steps. Given these considerations, tautomycetin represents a strong candidate for further investigation into its repurposing for sarcopenia, provided that future studies can resolve the current limitations in clinical data and address potential safety concerns (Niu et al., 2012; Swingle & Honkanen, 2019; Terrell et al., 2023).

Maxadilan,"Proposal for Maxadilan

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Maxadilan is a peptide originally isolated from the salivary glands of the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis and is best characterized as a selective agonist of the pituitary adenylate cyclase–activating polypeptide (PACAP) type I receptor (PAC1) (Váczy et al., 2016). As a naturally derived peptide, it belongs to a unique class of bioactive peptides that modulate G protein–coupled receptors, and its structural attributes confer a prolonged half‐life relative to other peptides due to notable conformational constraints (Algarni, 2018). This class of compounds has been widely investigated in both neurobiology and vascular biology, where agents like PACAP itself have been studied for their neuroprotective and vasodilatory properties. In this context, maxadilan is of particular interest as it acts with high selectivity toward the PAC1 receptor, suggesting a capacity to engage signaling cascades that culminate in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and protein kinase A (PKA) activation (Mey et al., 2024). Its peptide nature allows for parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous) delivery, a route that is well‐established for many peptide drugs, though formulation stability and immunogenicity assessments will be necessary for long‐term administration.

Therapeutic History:
In earlier studies, maxadilan has primarily been evaluated in preclinical models focused on its vascular and neuroprotective effects. For instance, clinical investigations such as the trial NCT02355756 were designed to assess maxadilan’s pharmacodynamic effects – specifically using dermal blood flow as a biomarker for PAC1 receptor engagement – in healthy volunteers, thereby establishing target engagement and safety profiles (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Beyond these vascular endpoints, maxadilan’s use has been explored in experimental settings to gauge anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic responses in models of ischemia‐induced retinal degeneration, where its administration preserved cellular integrity via PAC1 receptor–mediated signaling (Váczy et al., 2016; Mey et al., 2024). Despite this relatively robust history in vascular and neurological settings, there is little to no direct evidence in the existing literature that maxadilan has previously been used to treat sarcopenia or similar muscle wasting disorders. Instead, the current body of evidence regarding skeletal muscle involvement has been largely derived from genetic studies – for example, investigations demonstrating that muscle-specific knockout of PAC1 (as reported in Li et al., 2023) can protect against disuse-induced atrophy – suggesting a role for PAC1 signaling in the regulation of muscle proteostasis rather than its direct activation. Thus, while maxadilan itself has not been directly tested in sarcopenia models, its ability to activate the PAC1 receptor positions it as a candidate for repurposing, with the notion that its effects on cAMP/PKA signaling may beneficially modulate intracellular mechanisms in aged muscle cells.

Mechanism of Action:
The proposed mechanism underlying maxadilan’s therapeutic benefit in sarcopenia centers on its high-affinity, selective agonism at the PAC1 receptor, a receptor which, when activated, couples primarily to the Gαs protein leading to robust stimulation of adenylate cyclase, increased intracellular cAMP levels, and subsequent activation of PKA (Hoover et al., 2013; Algarni, 2018). Activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling cascade is known to have wide-ranging effects in various tissues, including skeletal muscle, where PKA phosphorylates numerous downstream targets. Among these targets is phospholamban (PLN), a regulatory protein that, in its unphosphorylated state, binds to and inhibits the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump – the critical mediator of calcium reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) following muscle contraction (Syed, 2016). When PKA phosphorylates PLN, its inhibitory effect on SERCA is relieved, resulting in enhanced calcium reuptake into the SR; this facilitates more rapid clearance of cytosolic Ca²⁺ transients and ultimately improves muscle relaxation and contractile recovery (Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). The hypothesis posits that in aged myotubes – where SERCA activity may be compromised due to oxidative modifications and altered phospholamban regulation – the application of maxadilan will elevate cAMP levels sufficiently to drive PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PLN, thereby restoring optimal SERCA function. This improved calcium handling is anticipated to translate into better muscle contractility, reduced muscle weakness, and overall amelioration of sarcopenia-related functional decline. Notably, evidence for PACAP/PAC1 signaling enhancing SERCA function through similar mechanisms is available in vascular models (Syed, 2016) and is a strong biochemical rationale for exploring this pathway in skeletal muscle as well.

Expected Effect:
Under the therapeutic paradigm proposed, maxadilan is expected to exert its beneficial effects by engaging PAC1 receptors on aged skeletal muscle cells, particularly myotubes, thereby elevating intracellular cAMP levels and activating PKA (Hoover et al., 2013). The resultant PKA activity would phosphorylate phospholamban, attenuating its inhibitory interaction with SERCA (Syed, 2016). This biochemical cascade is predicted to lead to enhanced SR Ca²⁺ uptake and faster clearance of cytosolic Ca²⁺ transients, a process that is critical for proper muscle relaxation and contractile function (Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). In an in vitro assay using aged myotubes, one would anticipate observable increases in cAMP levels upon maxadilan treatment, coupled with measurable increases in PLN phosphorylation. In parallel, functional assessments – such as calcium imaging studies – should reveal a restoration of Ca²⁺ transient kinetics (i.e., quicker decay rates) that correlate with improved excitation–contraction coupling and muscle contractility. Additionally, this mechanism is supported by studies suggesting that proper SERCA function is crucial for muscle health and that pharmacologic enhancement of SERCA activity can counteract age-related muscle weakness (Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). Since the PAC1 receptor is expressed not only in neuronal and vascular tissues but also in skeletal muscle fibers (Algarni, 2018), the anticipated effect is well rooted in the known distribution of the receptor and its downstream signaling machinery. It is also relevant to note that robust cAMP signaling in muscle cells is associated with other beneficial effects, such as improved mitochondrial function and reduced pro-atrophic signaling, further supporting the expected therapeutic outcome.

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of maxadilan as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia presents a mixed but promising scenario. On the strength side, maxadilan’s high specificity for the PAC1 receptor and its ability to trigger potent cAMP/PKA activation provide a strong biochemical rationale for its use in modulating processes that are key to muscle contractility. The established mechanism – wherein PKA-mediated phosphorylation of phospholamban relieves SERCA inhibition – is a novel and attractive strategy for addressing the impaired calcium dynamics that underlie age-related deficits in muscle function (Syed, 2016; Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). Furthermore, the peptide’s prolonged half-life, resulting from its unique structural features, may offer practical advantages in a clinical setting by reducing dosing frequency and potentially enhancing patient compliance (Váczy et al., 2016). In addition, the successful use of PAC1 receptor agonists in other therapeutic areas – including neuroprotective and vascular applications as indicated by clinical trial data (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015) and preclinical studies (Mey et al., 2024) – supports the general feasibility of modulating this receptor pharmacologically.

However, there are several noteworthy weaknesses and uncertainties that must be addressed. First, while there is compelling biochemical rationale and supporting evidence from vascular and neuronal models, there is a significant gap in the direct preclinical evidence for maxadilan’s efficacy in skeletal muscle or sarcopenia models. Studies such as Li et al. (2023) have demonstrated that genetic manipulation of PAC1 signaling can influence muscle atrophy, yet these findings were based on receptor deficiency rather than agonism, raising questions about the context-specific roles of PAC1 in muscle tissue. This apparent paradox – where PAC1 receptor knockout appears protective in a disuse atrophy model – suggests that the role of PAC1 signaling in muscle homeostasis may be more complex than a straightforward linear activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway and may depend on disease context, receptor isoforms, or the balance of downstream signaling pathways. Additionally, the translation of findings from vascular and neuronal tissues to skeletal muscle is not guaranteed; differences in receptor density, downstream effectors, and microenvironmental factors could alter maxadilan’s efficacy in aged muscle (Algarni, 2018; Palace, 2014). The safety profile in the context of chronic administration for sarcopenia – a disease prevalent in the elderly – will require careful evaluation regarding potential off-target effects, particularly given the known vasodilatory actions of PAC1 agonists that might lead to hypotension if not properly titrated (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015).

Another potential challenge lies in the peptide nature of maxadilan; while peptides can be highly selective and potent, they are also subject to proteolytic degradation, immune recognition, and issues with bioavailability, although its structural robustness may mitigate some of these issues (Váczy et al., 2016). Moreover, the dosing regimen, optimal delivery method, and potential need for formulation enhancements (e.g., encapsulation, PEGylation) will be critical factors for its clinical translation. Lastly, the absence of any prior clinical use of maxadilan in the treatment of muscle weakness or sarcopenia means that preclinical efficacy studies in relevant muscle models – including aged animal models of sarcopenia – must be rigorously conducted before any clinical investigation can be justified.

In summary, maxadilan represents an innovative and mechanistically attractive candidate for repurposing as a sarcopenia therapeutic. Its ability to selectively activate the PAC1 receptor and thereby enhance cAMP/PKA signaling to promote phospholamban phosphorylation and restore SERCA-mediated calcium handling addresses a critical unmet need in aged muscle physiology (Syed, 2016; Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). However, the candidate’s development is currently based largely on indirect evidence borrowed from other therapeutic areas, and conflicting genetic data emphasizing the potential protective effects of PAC1 receptor deficiency in muscle raise important questions regarding the net benefit of receptor agonism versus antagonism in this context (Li et al., 2023). Before moving forward, comprehensive preclinical studies are required to validate the proposed mechanism in aged or sarcopenic muscle, to elucidate the context-dependent roles of PAC1 signaling, and to optimize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of maxadilan for chronic use in an elderly population. Overall, while the hypothesis is compelling and scientifically grounded, the evaluation underscores the need for further rigorous investigation to determine whether maxadilan can safely and effectively be repurposed to restore muscle function in sarcopenia.

DS16570511,"Proposal for DS16570511

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
DS16570511 is a small‐molecule modulator discovered through high‐throughput screening of extensive compound libraries (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 1–2). Originally identified as a cell‐permeable compound that targets the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), DS16570511 belongs to the class of small molecules designed to modulate mitochondrial calcium (Ca²⁺) transport. Its discovery was driven by the need to overcome limitations associated with earlier MCU modulators such as Ruthenium Red and Ru360, which suffer from poor cell permeability and limited specificity (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19). As a candidate, DS16570511 was initially characterized in cellular and ex vivo heart models, where it demonstrated the ability to block mitochondrial Ca²⁺ influx, thereby preventing mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overload. Despite the therapeutic hypothesis proposing it as an MCU activator for enhancement of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake in aged myotubes, the literature consistently characterizes DS16570511 as an inhibitor rather than an activator of the MCU (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 4–5; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19). The general class of compounds to which DS16570511 belongs has been used experimentally to modulate mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signaling in cardiac and neuronal systems, with the intent of ameliorating injury associated with calcium overload. However, its chemical synthesis details and structural optimization have been reported only in the context of preclinical studies and not through extensive therapeutic development pipelines (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 1–2).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, DS16570511 has been evaluated in preclinical models, particularly in the context of cardiac ischemia–reperfusion injury and neuronal excitotoxicity. Its ability to suppress mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overload in Langendorff‐perfused rat hearts and to modulate Ca²⁺ dynamics in HEK293A cells by blocking MCU‐dependent Ca²⁺ influx has been documented (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 5–6; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19). To date, there is no published evidence that DS16570511, or other members of this compound class, has been used clinically or in veterinary settings to treat sarcopenia or related muscle wasting diseases. Preclinical data focus predominantly on cardiac models where inhibition of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake resulted in improvements in cardiac contractility and protection against Ca²⁺ overload-induced injury, not on enhancing mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake as would be required to counteract the energy deficits associated with sarcopenia (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Arnst et al., 2022, pp. 20–21). Additionally, while other natural compounds (e.g., kaempferol) have been shown to act as MCU activators with putative benefits on cellular metabolism, DS16570511 has not been demonstrated to have any precedent or prior therapeutic use in the treatment of skeletal muscle degenerative conditions (Li et al., 2025, pp. 6–8; Zampieri et al., 2016, pp. 1–2).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, DS16570511 has been extensively characterized as an inhibitor of the MCU complex. The MCU is a highly selective Ca²⁺ channel located in the inner mitochondrial membrane that mediates the uptake of Ca²⁺ into the mitochondrial matrix. This process is essential for the activation of Ca²⁺-sensitive dehydrogenases in the Krebs cycle, thereby coupling cytosolic Ca²⁺ transients to mitochondrial ATP production (Mammucari et al., 2015, pp. 1–3). DS16570511, during in vitro studies, has been shown to dose-dependently block both MCU-dependent and MICU1-dependent increases in mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake. The compound achieves this by binding—directly or indirectly—to components of the uniporter complex, thereby reducing Ca²⁺ influx into the mitochondria (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 4–6). This inhibitory activity has been linked to an enhancement in cardiac contractility observed in isolated heart models, presumably due to the prevention of Ca²⁺ overload that would otherwise lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent cell injury (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 5–6; Morciano et al., 2022, pp. 9–10). Importantly, DS16570511 exhibits off-target effects, including alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential, with some studies reporting mitochondrial depolarization, which raises concerns regarding its specificity and safety (Shumanska et al., 2023, pp. 52–55; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19). The known molecular interactions suggest that DS16570511 effectively suppresses mitochondrial Ca²⁺ influx rather than enhancing it; this is in direct contrast to the therapeutic hypothesis proposing that it functions as an “MCU activator” to boost mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake. Additionally, the literature does not provide any biochemical data to support a mechanism of action consistent with MCU activation in any cell type, including skeletal muscle cells (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Cui et al., 2019, pp. 11–12).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underlying the repurposing of DS16570511 for sarcopenia posits that enhancing mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake in aged myotubes could rebalance cytosolic Ca²⁺ transients, improve ATP production, and thereby sustain contraction and recovery kinetics. In muscle tissue, mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake plays a critical role in stimulating metabolic enzymes and matching energy production with the contractile demands of the muscle fiber (Mammucari et al., 2015, pp. 1–3; Zampieri et al., 2016, pp. 1–2). In theory, an MCU activator would boost these processes and help to counteract the mitochondrial dysfunction that is observed in sarcopenic muscle. However, DS16570511, as characterized in the literature, acts as an inhibitor of the MCU, thereby reducing Ca²⁺ uptake into the mitochondria. Consequently, rather than rebalancing cytosolic Ca²⁺ transients by enhancing mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, DS16570511 may decrease mitochondrial Ca²⁺ levels, potentially compromising the activation of Ca²⁺-sensitive metabolic enzymes required for efficient ATP production (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 4–5; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19). Additionally, skeletal muscle expresses MCU and its regulatory subunits, and mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake is indeed critical for muscle bioenergetics (Mammucari et al., 2015, pp. 1–3; Zampieri et al., 2016, pp. 1–2); however, the expected anabolic or metabolic benefits in myotubes would require an increase in mitochondrial Ca²⁺, not its inhibition. Therefore, if DS16570511 is used in the proposed assay on aged myotubes, the drug is more likely to decrease mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake and may even exacerbate energy production deficits rather than improving contraction and recovery kinetics. There is significant literature supporting the idea that enhanced MCU activity is beneficial in muscle cells; indeed, activation of MCU (or increasing its expression) has been associated with muscle hypertrophy and improved bioenergetics (Zampieri et al., 2016, pp. 1–2; Coen et al., 2019, pp. 6–7). Because DS16570511 does not act as an activator but rather as an inhibitor, its expected effect in the proposed assay would likely be counterproductive relative to the therapeutic objectives of treating sarcopenia (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 5–6; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, while DS16570511 is a well-characterized small molecule capable of modulating mitochondrial Ca²⁺ transport through its action on the MCU complex, the extensive literature identifies it unequivocally as an inhibitor rather than an activator (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19). The therapeutic hypothesis for its repurposing in sarcopenia relies on the assumption that DS16570511 enhances mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake and thereby improves ATP production, contributing to improved myotube contraction and recovery. However, the available preclinical and biochemical studies indicate that DS16570511 reduces mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, a mechanism beneficial in cardiac and neuronal protection settings but likely deleterious for skeletal muscle where enhanced mitochondrial Ca²⁺ is required for metabolic matching and energy production (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 5–6; Li et al., 2025, pp. 6–8). Furthermore, DS16570511’s off-target effects, including its impact on mitochondrial membrane potential and the induction of mitochondrial permeability transition, raise additional safety concerns that would need careful evaluation before any repurposing for chronic conditions like sarcopenia could be considered (Shumanska et al., 2023, pp. 52–55; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19). Although restoring mitochondrial bioenergetics is a promising strategy to counteract age-related muscle degeneration—as demonstrated by various interventions that enhance mitochondrial function through increased Ca²⁺ uptake and improved redox balance (Zampieri et al., 2016, pp. 1–2; Coen et al., 2019, pp. 6–7)—DS16570511 does not fulfill the role of an MCU activator; instead, its inhibitory properties are at odds with the proposed therapeutic mechanism for sarcopenia. Based on this comprehensive review, the repurposing of DS16570511 for sarcopenia is not supported by the existing literature. Its strengths lie in its drug-like properties (cell permeability and specificity in certain experimental settings) and its capacity to modulate mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake in contexts where inhibition is protective. However, its classification as an inhibitor, rather than an activator, its potential off-target effects, and the lack of evidence linking its use to improved skeletal muscle function or attenuation of sarcopenia represent significant weaknesses for the intended therapeutic application (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 5–6; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19; Morciano et al., 2022, pp. 8–9). Therefore, while the overall strategy of targeting mitochondrial Ca²⁺ homeostasis is promising for sarcopenia, DS16570511 itself is not a viable candidate in its current form for this indication, and alternative small-molecule MCU activators or approaches that enhance mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake should be explored instead (Cacciatore et al., 2024, pp. 16–18; Chen et al., 2023, pp. 13–15).

ML-9,"Proposal for ML-9

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
ML-9 is a synthetic small‐molecule compound originally developed as an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and is chemically identified as 1-(5-chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine. It belongs to the aminopyridine and naphthalene sulphonamide class of compounds, which have been widely used in muscle biology research to dissect calcium‐dependent contraction mechanisms and cytoskeletal dynamics (Ito et al., 2004; Shi et al., 2007). Its synthesis typically involves forming a sulfonamide bond between chloronaphthalene sulfonyl chloride and a hexahydro-diazepine derivative, yielding a molecule that is both cell-permeable and capable of modulating intracellular signaling pathways. Historically, compounds in this class have been used as pharmacological tools to investigate MLCK functions as well as indirectly influencing calcium channel activities in smooth and skeletal muscle tissues (Martinsen et al., 2014; Xiong et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
ML-9 has been extensively used in experimental settings to inhibit MLCK and study its role in muscle contraction and calcium homeostasis. It has also been repurposed in various studies to modulate store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) by interfering with STIM1 oligomerization, a critical step necessary for activating Orai1 channels (Smyth et al., 2008; Shaikh et al., 2018). Although the compound’s historical use has predominantly been in vitro and in animal models to study calcium dynamics in muscle cells and other excitable tissues, there is limited clinical data regarding its direct use in treating sarcopenia or related muscle wasting conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, the mechanistic insights derived from its application in modulating STIM1 function and SOCE in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells provide a rationale for its potential repurposing in age-related muscle disorders such as sarcopenia (Conte et al., 2021a; Brotto et al., 2014).

Mechanism of Action:
ML-9’s primary mechanism involves the inhibition of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), reducing the phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain and thereby modulating actomyosin contractility (Ito et al., 2004; Shi et al., 2007). Beyond this classical role, recent studies have shown that ML-9 acts as an inhibitor of STIM1 oligomerization, a process essential for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) activation (Smyth et al., 2008). STIM1 is a calcium sensor located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that, upon detecting calcium store depletion, oligomerizes and translocates to areas near the plasma membrane to interact with Orai1 channels, forming puncta essential for SOCE. ML-9 disrupts this process by reversing STIM1 puncta formation, thereby inhibiting the subsequent calcium influx (Smyth et al., 2008; Shaikh et al., 2018). Biochemically, this action is thought to occur via direct interference with STIM1 conformational changes or its phosphorylation state, effectively lowering the amplitude of SOCE without completely abolishing calcium entry (Smyth et al., 2008). Additionally, ML-9 may exhibit MLCK-independent inhibition on certain calcium-permeable TRP channels as shown in studies involving TRPC6, although this effect appears to be separate from its action on STIM1 (Shi et al., 2007). As STIM1 is expressed in skeletal muscle and its proper function is critical for muscle contraction and differentiation, modulating STIM1-dependent SOCE could be a viable strategy for stabilizing intracellular Ca²⁺ dynamics in aged myotubes (Conte et al., 2021b; Kiviluoto et al., 2011).

Expected Effect:
The proposed hypothesis for repurposing ML-9 in sarcopenia is that by inhibiting STIM1 oligomerization, ML-9 can modulate the balance of store-operated Ca²⁺ entry. In aged skeletal muscle, aberrant STIM1 activity can lead to pathological Ca²⁺ influx, causing cytotoxic Ca²⁺ overload while also compromising sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) replenishment required for rapid calcium transients during contraction (Terrell et al., 2023). The expected effect of ML-9 is to reduce excessive SOCE activity, thereby preventing cytotoxic elevations in intracellular Ca²⁺ while still permitting sufficient Ca²⁺ entry for SR refilling. This balanced modulation aims to stabilize Ca²⁺ transient amplitudes and improve muscle function by maintaining calcium homeostasis. Since STIM1 is essential for muscle differentiation and contraction, normalizing its function rather than completely blocking it is critical (Conte et al., 2021a; Brotto et al., 2014). Furthermore, aged skeletal muscle often exhibits compensatory adaptations such as altered expression of SERCA pumps and other Ca²⁺-handling proteins that could be favorably modulated by a controlled reduction of SOCE (Conte et al., 2024; Dong & Maturana, 2025). In vitro assays using aged myotubes and ex vivo muscle preparations from aged animal models are expected to demonstrate improved SR Ca²⁺ replenishment, reduced basal Ca²⁺ overload, and improved contractile force upon treatment with ML-9.

Overall Evaluation:
ML-9 presents a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of sarcopenia based on its dual pharmacological actions. Its well-characterized inhibition of MLCK coupled with its demonstrated ability to disrupt STIM1 oligomerization positions it as a unique modulator of SOCE, an essential pathway in muscle Ca²⁺ homeostasis (Smyth et al., 2008; Shaikh et al., 2018). A significant strength of ML-9 is its defined cell permeability and the extensive body of literature supporting its effects on calcium dynamics in muscle cells, including its capability to reduce pathological Ca²⁺ influx while potentially preserving the necessary Ca²⁺ entry for SR replenishment (Conte et al., 2021a; Brotto et al., 2014). Its relatively well-known off-target profile and historical use as a research tool give it a favorable background for mechanistic studies in the context of aging muscle (Harteneck & Gollasch, 2011; Ito et al., 2004).

However, there are several challenges and weaknesses that need to be addressed. First, while ML-9 has shown efficacy in vitro in modulating STIM1-dependent SOCE, there is a paucity of direct data in animal models of sarcopenia or in clinical contexts specifically addressing aged skeletal muscle (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Conte et al., 2024). Second, the complex dual role of SOCE in muscle physiology means that excessive inhibition may impair the physiological Ca²⁺ influx necessary for muscle contraction and repair, potentially exacerbating muscle weakness if not carefully controlled (Kiviluoto et al., 2011; Michelucci et al., 2018). Moreover, off-target effects such as interactions with TRPC channels or interference with other calcium-handling processes have been documented and must be carefully quantified (Shi et al., 2007; Xiong et al., 2017).

Another consideration is the autophagic and lysosomal disruption observed with ML-9 in cardiomyocytes, which raises concerns about potential cytotoxicity in other muscle cell types under stress (Shaikh et al., 2018). This cytotoxic potential necessitates thorough in vivo studies to ensure that any improvement in calcium homeostasis does not come at the expense of muscle cell viability or induce deleterious long-term effects. It will be critical to delineate the dosage window that achieves the desired balance between reducing pathological Ca²⁺ overload and maintaining sufficient SOCE for SR refilling and normal muscle function (Smyth et al., 2008; Terrell et al., 2023).

Overall, ML-9 offers a mechanistically specific approach to target the altered Ca²⁺ dynamics observed in aged muscle. Its ability to inhibit STIM1 oligomerization with defined cellular effects on SOCE is a significant strength, supporting the hypothesis that modulation rather than complete blockade of SOCE may restore proper calcium balance in sarcopenia. Nonetheless, further targeted experimental validation in aged myotubes and animal models of sarcopenia is required to fully evaluate its efficacy and safety profile. Preclinical studies should specifically address the optimal concentration range, off-target profiles, and long-term effects on muscle physiology and regeneration. Only with such data can the therapeutic potential of ML-9 for sarcopenia be conclusively determined, balancing its benefits in preventing cytotoxic Ca²⁺ elevations with the risk of impairing necessary Ca²⁺-dependent repair and contraction processes (Conte et al., 2021a; Brotto et al., 2014).

In conclusion, while ML-9 possesses promising attributes as a repurposed drug candidate for sarcopenia—owing to its established ability to modulate STIM1-dependent SOCE and thus stabilize calcium dynamics—the current literature primarily supports its utility as a research tool rather than a clinically validated therapeutic. Its strengths lie in its mechanistic specificity and extensive experimental characterization, yet its potential weaknesses, including possible off-target toxicity and the delicate balance required to maintain physiological calcium entry in aging muscle, underscore the need for comprehensive preclinical evaluation before advancing to clinical trials.
