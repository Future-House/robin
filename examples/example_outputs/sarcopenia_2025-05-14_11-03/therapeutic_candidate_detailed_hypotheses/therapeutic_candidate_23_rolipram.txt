Proposal for Rolipram

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rolipram is a small‐molecule, synthetic compound originally developed as a selective phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor. It was first synthesized several decades ago and belongs to a class of compounds that work by inhibiting the degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), thereby elevating its intracellular concentration. As a PDE4 inhibitor, rolipram has been mainly evaluated in preclinical settings for its anti‐inflammatory properties, neuroprotective effects, and potential benefits in mood disorders. The chemical origins of rolipram trace back to early synthetic medicinal chemistry efforts targeting cAMP metabolism, and its overall profile has been well characterized in cardiac, vascular, and central nervous system (CNS) tissues (Crocetti et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2019). Rolipram’s inclusion in this drug class is significant because PDE4 inhibitors have a long history of both experimental and clinical investigation for conditions where modulation of cAMP levels is therapeutically beneficial. Generally, compounds in this class have been used to counteract inflammation and to modulate CNS signaling; however, the unique mechanism by which they elevate cAMP has recently garnered interest as a potentially effective means to address impaired calcium handling and contractile dysfunction in muscle tissues.

Therapeutic History:
Historically, rolipram was evaluated primarily for its anti‐inflammatory and CNS benefits. In preclinical models, it has demonstrated the ability to enhance cardiac contractility by modulating local cAMP levels in microdomains associated with the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in cardiomyocytes, where it increases the phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) and thereby augments the activity of the SR Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) (Beca et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2019). In cardiovascular research, rolipram has been shown to improve relaxation kinetics and contractile function through its specific elevation of cAMP and subsequent PKA activation, which is essential for proper Ca2+ cycling (Kaneda et al., 2010). Outside the cardiovascular field, PDE4 inhibitors also have been investigated for their protective effects in models of sepsis‐induced dysfunction and inflammatory conditions in other tissues, and agents in this class have demonstrated oral bioavailability along with well‐documented CNS effects (Ji et al., 2020). Despite these promising attributes and extensive research in related areas, there has been only limited direct investigation of rolipram for muscle wasting conditions such as sarcopenia. A clinical trial search using the terms “Rolipram AND muscle,” “PDE4 inhibitor AND sarcopenia,” “Rolipram AND aging,” and “Rolipram AND muscle function” has so far not yielded any directly registered clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov). However, preclinical studies in animal models and muscle cell systems have provided evidence that PDE4 inhibition may enhance muscle function and counteract atrophic processes, as demonstrated by improved proteolysis markers and enhanced relaxation kinetics in skeletal muscle preparations (Lira et al., 2011; Qaisar et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
Rolipram specifically inhibits PDE4, which is one of several families of phosphodiesterases responsible for hydrolyzing cAMP. Under normal physiological conditions, PDE4 functions to tightly regulate cAMP levels to ensure that signaling events downstream of cAMP are precisely controlled. Inhibition of PDE4 by rolipram prevents the degradation of cAMP, thereby resulting in a localized accumulation of this critical second messenger. Elevated cAMP, in turn, activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates multiple target proteins. One such well‐characterized target is phospholamban (PLN), a regulatory protein expressed in both cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. Under basal conditions, PLN binds to and inhibits SERCA, the enzyme responsible for pumping Ca2+ from the cytosol back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a process essential for muscle relaxation following contraction. Once phosphorylated by PKA, PLN undergoes a conformational change and dissociates from SERCA, effectively “relieving” its inhibition. This modification leads to an increase in SERCA activity, enhancing Ca2+ reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and thereby accelerating the decay of cytosolic Ca2+ transients during muscle relaxation (Beca et al., 2011; Stathopoulou et al., 2019). Enhanced SERCA-mediated calcium uptake not only improves relaxation kinetics but also contributes to more effective muscle contraction-relaxation cycles overall. Evidence for this mechanism is supported by studies in Langendorff-perfused isolated hearts where rolipram increased left ventricular pressures and contractility through PKA-mediated PLN phosphorylation (Beca et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2019). Moreover, in skeletal muscle models, PDE4 inhibition has been associated with reduced proteolysis and improved muscle protein synthesis, which may be attributed at least in part to improvements in intracellular calcium handling via the cAMP/PKA pathway (Lira et al., 2011). Although most mechanistic studies have been conducted in cardiac muscle or vascular smooth muscle, the relevant molecules—cAMP, PKA, PLN, and SERCA—are also expressed in skeletal muscle. Thus, the same signaling cascade is expected to operate in aged myotubes, where impaired SERCA activity and diminished PLN phosphorylation contribute to suboptimal Ca2+ homeostasis, a key feature of sarcopenia (Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). Additionally, studies on mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle have indicated that PDE4 inhibitors like rolipram can activate alternative pathways (for example, AMPK/Sirt1) that are essential for mitochondrial function and overall muscle health (Park et al., 2021). Together, these actions support a model in which rolipram’s ability to elevate cAMP and activate PKA-mediated PLN phosphorylation underlies its potential to enhance SERCA activity and thereby improve calcium reuptake efficiency in aging muscle cells.

Expected Effect:
Based on the above mechanism, the expected effect of rolipram in a sarcopenia model would be multifaceted. In aged myotubes or skeletal muscle tissues from sarcopenic subjects, the impairment of calcium reuptake due to reduced SERCA activity is a major contributor to diminished contractile function and defective relaxation kinetics. The PDE4 inhibitory action of rolipram is anticipated to elevate intracellular cAMP levels, thereby activating PKA and promoting the phosphorylation of PLN. With phosphorylated PLN unable to inhibit SERCA effectively, the enzyme’s activity would recover, leading to accelerated Ca2+ reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This improvement in calcium handling would be expected to enhance both the relaxation phase (by faster clearance of Ca2+ from the cytosol) and potentially the subsequent contraction phase (by ensuring greater availability of Ca2+ in the SR for release upon stimulation) (Qaisar et al., 2020; Ray & Shibaguchi, 2021). In vitro assays using aged myotubes are likely to show an increased rate of Ca2+ transient decay, improved force generation, and perhaps improved endurance parameters in response to rolipram treatment. Expression analyses should verify that key components of the cAMP/PKA/PLN/SERCA pathway are present in skeletal muscle cells. Indeed, previous studies have confirmed that phospholamban is expressed in skeletal muscle, albeit with some isoform differences compared to cardiac muscle, and that it plays a crucial role in modulating SERCA activity (Stathopoulou et al., 2019; Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). Furthermore, rolipram may also exert beneficial anti‐proteolytic effects in skeletal muscle. Elevated cAMP is known to inhibit pathways leading to muscle protein degradation such as those mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Lira et al., 2011), suggesting that rolipram might help preserve muscle mass in addition to improving contractile function. Together, these expected outcomes suggest that rolipram could counteract two key pathological hallmarks of sarcopenia: impaired calcium handling and enhanced muscle proteolysis.

Overall Evaluation:
Rolipram presents as a highly attractive candidate for repurposing in the treatment of sarcopenia due to several key strengths. Its well-defined mechanism of action—namely, the inhibition of PDE4 resulting in cAMP accumulation and subsequent activation of PKA leading to phospholamban phosphorylation—directly addresses a central defect in aged muscle physiology: impaired SERCA activity and suboptimal Ca2+ reuptake. This mechanism is supported by robust data from cardiac and smooth muscle studies (Beca et al., 2011; Kaneda et al., 2010), and the molecules involved are also present in skeletal muscle (Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). Additionally, rolipram’s oral bioavailability and the extensive pharmacokinetic and safety profiles already established in CNS and cardiovascular studies provide an advantageous starting point for rapid clinical translation. The compound also has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-proteolytic effects, which are highly relevant given that chronic inflammation and muscle protein breakdown are both significant contributors to sarcopenia pathology (Lira et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2020). Moreover, prior research in related conditions, such as COPD cachexia and sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction, further underscores the potential versatility of PDE4 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy (Barreiro et al., 2018; Ji et al., 2020).

However, there are also potential weaknesses and uncertainties that must be considered. The majority of existing mechanistic data for rolipram comes from studies on cardiac and vascular smooth muscle, with relatively little direct evidence regarding its effects on skeletal muscle aging or in models of sarcopenia. While the molecular pathways are conserved, there may be significant tissue-specific differences in PDE4 isoform expression, regulatory protein interactions, and compensation by other pathways that could affect the outcome in skeletal muscle. Additionally, rolipram has been associated with CNS side effects in previous trials due to its effects on neuronal cAMP signaling, posing potential challenges for tolerability in elderly patients if high doses are required (Crocetti et al., 2022). Furthermore, while increased cAMP and enhanced SERCA activity are generally beneficial for muscle function, the extent to which rolipram can restore calcium dynamics in the context of longstanding sarcopenia remains to be determined experimentally. There is also the possibility that the off-target effects observed in some studies may limit its long-term use in a chronic disease setting (Stathopoulou et al., 2019). Finally, while rolipram’s ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) profile has been characterized in other indications, pharmacodynamic studies specifically in aged skeletal muscle will be essential to validate dosing strategies and clinical endpoints.

In summary, rolipram offers a compelling, mechanism-based approach for the treatment of sarcopenia by leveraging its capacity to elevate cAMP and trigger PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PLN, thereby enhancing SERCA activity and improving Ca2+ reuptake kinetics. The candidate’s strengths include a well-documented biochemical mechanism, a favorable ADME profile supported by CNS and cardiovascular data, and established anti-inflammatory properties that may further benefit muscle preservation. The main weaknesses stem from the current lack of direct preclinical evidence in skeletal muscle or aging models and the potential for CNS-related side effects that will need to be addressed through careful dose titration or tissue-selective targeting strategies. Overall, rolipram represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia that merits further investigation in dedicated preclinical studies using aged skeletal muscle models and, subsequently, in early-phase clinical trials to confirm its efficacy and safety in an elderly population (Kaneda et al., 2010; Qaisar et al., 2020; Ray & Shibaguchi, 2021).
