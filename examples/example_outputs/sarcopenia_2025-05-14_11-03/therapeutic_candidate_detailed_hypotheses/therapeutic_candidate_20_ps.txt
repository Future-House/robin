Proposal for PS Compound 5 (from Luraghi et al., J Med Chem 2022)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
PS Compound 5 is a small molecule originally optimized by Luraghi et al. (Unknown Reference) for activation of SERCA2a in cardiac muscle. It belongs to the class of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase (SERCA) activators, a group of compounds designed to enhance the activity of these ion pumps. The SERCA pumps are responsible for the critical task of sequestering cytosolic Ca²⁺ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), hence promoting proper contractile–relaxation cycles in muscle tissues. Originally developed for cardiac applications, where enhanced Ca²⁺ reuptake into the SR can improve contractility and energy efficiency, PS Compound 5 is now being hypothesized for repurposing in sarcopenia. Its chemical scaffold appears amenable to further optimization to selectively activate SERCA2b in skeletal muscle cells. In the context of skeletal muscle aging, SERCA2b is essential for maintaining Ca²⁺ homeostasis, as disruptions in its activity are associated with weakened contractile function and reduced muscle performance (Velez & Jesus, 2018; Mina, 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Although PS Compound 5 has been primarily studied in the context of its cardiac applications—including demonstration of target engagement in diabetic rats with excellent safety margins (LD₅₀ > 800 mg/kg oral)—its proposed repurposing for sarcopenia has not yet transitioned into advanced preclinical or clinical investigations specific to skeletal muscle. The broader SERCA activator class has been probed in various contexts; for example, other compounds such as CDN1163 have been used in mechanistic studies to restore Ca²⁺ handling in neuronal models of Wolfram syndrome (Liiv et al., 2024) and have known implications for improving cellular bioenergetics. Additionally, clinical trial searches using terms related to ATP2A2, SERCA2, and Ca²⁺ homeostasis in skeletal muscle have identified studies addressing related pathways in muscle dysfunction, yet none have provided direct evidence of PS Compound 5 efficacy or safety in conditions such as sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Historically, compounds targeting SERCA modulation have been more explored in cardiac or neuronal systems rather than in skeletal muscle aging; however, emerging evidence from studies on muscle metabolism and calcium handling—such as those detailing SERCA’s role in excitation–contraction coupling (Velez & Jesus, 2018) and the impact of dysregulated Ca²⁺ signaling on muscle fatigue (Sopariwala et al., 2015)—provides a rationale for considering such agents in sarcopenia. To date, there is no published clinical history of any SERCA2b-selective activator being used directly in sarcopenic patients or models of muscle atrophy, highlighting a gap but also an opportunity for further investigation (Velez & Jesus, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, SERCA pumps operate by using the energy from ATP hydrolysis to transport Ca²⁺ from the cytosol into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum, thereby lowering cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentrations and replenishing the intracellular Ca²⁺ stores required for subsequent muscle contraction. SERCA2b, the ubiquitously expressed isoform found in both cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscle, differs from the SERCA2a isoform by its higher Ca²⁺ affinity and distinct regulatory interactions. This isoform is particularly critical in aged skeletal muscle, where disrupted Ca²⁺ handling is implicated in decreased contractility and increased muscle fatigue (Mina, 2023; Velez & Jesus, 2018). PS Compound 5 is hypothesized to activate SERCA2b by binding to and stabilizing a conformation of the pump that favors efficient Ca²⁺ uptake. Structural analyses from related studies suggest that small molecule activators can interact with the transmembrane domains of SERCA—possibly near regions influenced by redox regulation or by interactions with endogenous regulators such as phospholamban—and shift the delicate equilibrium of the pump’s conformational states towards the active E1 state, thereby increasing the turnover rate of Ca²⁺ transport (Liiv et al., 2024). This activation should result in enhanced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ uptake rates, decreased cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentrations, and improved fidelity of Ca²⁺ transients, which are vital for sustained and robust muscle contraction. The existing literature supports the notion that improving SERCA function in muscle cells can lead to better Ca²⁺ homeostasis, as evidenced by studies in which SERCA overexpression or activation restored proper Ca²⁺ dynamics in disease models characterized by impaired Ca²⁺ handling, including Wolfram syndrome (Liiv et al., 2024). Additionally, studies emphasizing the modulation of SERCA by endogenous regulators such as sarcolipin (Sopariwala et al., 2015) reaffirm the centrality of SERCA activity in muscle energetics and contractile function. PS Compound 5 is thus expected to function through a similar mechanism, albeit with greater selectivity and potency tailored toward aged skeletal muscle cells.

Expected Effect:
In the context of an assay using aged skeletal myotubes, the expected pharmacological action of PS Compound 5 is to robustly activate SERCA2b at nanomolar concentrations. By enhancing the rate of Ca²⁺ uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the compound is anticipated to lower the pathological levels of cytosolic Ca²⁺ that are commonly seen in sarcopenia and contribute to impaired muscle contractility. This reduction in cytosolic Ca²⁺ would restore the amplitude and timing of Ca²⁺ transients needed for proper excitation–contraction coupling, thus potentially reversing aspects of muscle weakness associated with aging (Velez & Jesus, 2018; Mina, 2023). Given that SERCA2b is endogenously expressed in slow-twitch muscle fibers which are particularly affected during the progression of sarcopenia (Velez & Jesus, 2018), the compound’s mechanism—by reducing Ca²⁺ overload and normalizing Ca²⁺ kinetics—could also improve mitochondrial function. Enhanced Ca²⁺ handling in the SR is linked to improved mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation since Ca²⁺ plays a role in activating key dehydrogenases in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Liiv et al., 2024; Mina, 2023). Moreover, the compound’s excellent pharmacokinetic profile reported in diabetic rat models supports the feasibility of achieving sustained target engagement in vivo, which is critical for clinical translation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Therefore, in cell-based assays, one would expect PS Compound 5 to increase SR Ca²⁺ uptake rates, ultimately leading to more efficient cytosolic Ca²⁺ clearance, restoration of Ca²⁺ transient fidelity, and subsequent improvement in muscle contractile performance. This anticipated effect is predicated on a well-established understanding of SERCA’s role in muscle physiology and the necessity of maintained Ca²⁺ homeostasis for muscle fiber health (Velez & Jesus, 2018; Liiv et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of PS Compound 5 as a potential repurposed therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia reveals several promising strengths but also highlights critical areas that require extensive further study. One major strength is the compelling mechanistic rationale provided by the fundamental role of SERCA2b in maintaining Ca²⁺ homeostasis in skeletal muscle. Literature indicates that interventions aimed at enhancing SERCA activity can restore proper Ca²⁺ handling and improve muscle energetics, as seen in models of related disorders (Velez & Jesus, 2018; Liiv et al., 2024). PS Compound 5’s reported high nanomolar potency and favorable safety profile in preclinical studies (with an LD₅₀ greater than 800 mg/kg orally reported in diabetic rat studies) support the notion that its pharmacological modulation of SERCA activity could be clinically translatable (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, its structural scaffold, which was initially optimized for SERCA2a, is believed to be adaptable to potent activation of the SERCA2b isoform prevalent in slow-twitch skeletal fibers, addressing one of the crucial deficits observed in aged muscle.

However, the weaknesses are also significant. Despite the attractive hypothesis, the current literature does not provide direct biochemical, preclinical, or clinical data to demonstrate that PS Compound 5 specifically activates SERCA2b in aged skeletal myotubes. Many of the referenced studies, such as those by Liiv et al. (Liiv et al., 2024) and reports on SERCA function in neuronal models, focus primarily on neurological or cardiac applications rather than skeletal muscle. Furthermore, clinical trials investigating SERCA modulators to improve muscle function in sarcopenia have yet to yield detailed results that can be directly extrapolated to support the efficacy of PS Compound 5 in this new indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

The translational gap also includes uncertainties about tissue selectivity, as the compound was originally optimized for cardiac SERCA2a and not developed with skeletal muscle in mind. This raises important questions regarding its pharmacodynamic behavior in skeletal tissue, such as whether its activation of SERCA2b in skeletal myotubes will be as robust and selective as hypothesized, and how it may interact with endogenous regulatory proteins that differ between cardiac and skeletal muscle (Mina, 2023; Velez & Jesus, 2018). Additionally, while the exceptional oral safety in diabetic rat models is encouraging, animal studies specific to sarcopenia or aged muscle models have not been reported; thus, the predictive validity of these safety and efficacy metrics for sarcopenia treatment remains to be fully established. Lastly, while improved Ca²⁺ transient fidelity is a reasonable biomarker for enhanced muscle function, comprehensive histological and functional assessments in relevant animal models of muscle atrophy will be essential to truly validate its therapeutic potential (Velez & Jesus, 2018; Liiv et al., 2024; Mina, 2023).

In conclusion, PS Compound 5 represents a highly intriguing candidate for repurposing as a sarcopenia therapeutic based on its strong mechanistic rationale and favorable preclinical pharmacology in non-skeletal muscle contexts. Nonetheless, significant gaps in the current literature—from direct evidence of SERCA2b activation in aged skeletal muscle to comprehensive in vivo efficacy and safety data in sarcopenia models—underscore the need for further targeted research. As such, while the candidate holds promise, its novel application for sarcopenia remains speculative until further rigorous biochemical, preclinical, and eventually clinical studies are conducted to validate its efficacy in improving muscle function through restoring Ca²⁺ homeostasis (Velez & Jesus, 2018; Liiv et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
