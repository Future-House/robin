Proposal for Infliximab

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody developed to neutralize tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine. This protein‐based therapeutic is produced by combining the variable regions derived from a murine antibody with the constant region of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), thereby creating a molecule that is less immunogenic in humans compared with a wholly murine antibody while retaining high affinity for TNF-α. As an anti-TNF agent, infliximab belongs to a class of biologics that have been designed to inhibit the activity of TNF-α by binding both its soluble and membrane-bound forms. Historically, these agents have been widely used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriasis due to their ability to dampen exaggerated immune responses (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b). The synthesis and subsequent clinical development of infliximab followed the paradigm of using targeted immunotherapy to intercept key inflammatory mediators, and its established pharmacokinetic profile – including a half-life of approximately 7–12 days – has contributed to its integration into therapeutic regimens for inflammatory conditions (Stratos et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Infliximab has an extensive therapeutic history in both clinical and preclinical settings. Biochemically, it has been shown to neutralize TNF-α and thereby reduce a spectrum of downstream inflammatory processes in chronic inflammatory diseases. Clinically, infliximab has proven effective in diseases characterized by high TNF-α levels, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, where its administration has led to decreased symptoms, markers of inflammation, and notable improvements in patient quality of life (Subramaniam et al., 2015). In the context of muscle-wasting conditions, there is evidence – particularly in Crohn’s disease patients – where infliximab reversed inflammatory muscle wasting (sarcopenia) by increasing muscle volume and strength. For example, clinical studies have employed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate that infliximab increased quadriceps muscle volume and improved maximal contraction strength in Crohn’s disease, thus suggesting a reversal of inflammatory sarcopenia (Subramaniam et al., 2015). Despite these promising findings in inflammatory settings, clinical trial data dedicated solely to primary sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) are lacking, and searches for “Infliximab AND sarcopenia” in clinical trial databases have so far yielded no dedicated studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Nonetheless, the repurposing of infliximab for sarcopenia is supported by its mechanism of action and substantial safety data gleaned from its established use in chronic inflammatory disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b).

Mechanism of Action:
The known mechanism of action of infliximab centers on its ability to specifically bind TNF-α, preventing this cytokine from interacting with its cell-surface receptors—TNFR1 and TNFR2 – and thereby attenuating the ensuing pro-inflammatory cascade. Binding of TNF-α to its receptors normally triggers a variety of intracellular signaling cascades, including the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). In skeletal muscle, NF-κB activation is one of the key pathways leading to muscle protein degradation, inhibition of myogenesis, and promotion of catabolic genes such as atrogin-1 and MuRF1. By neutralizing TNF-α, infliximab prevents NF-κB activation, thereby interrupting this cascade (Dirks & Leeuwenburgh, 2006). Furthermore, increased chronic levels of TNF-α have been associated with aberrant Ca²⁺ signaling in muscle fibers. Specifically, pro-inflammatory signaling may lead to hyperactivation of kinases like Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and subsequent dysregulation of key calcium-handling proteins such as the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase (SERCA). Dysregulation of these proteins contributes to impaired calcium transient amplitude and kinetics, which ultimately compromises excitation–contraction coupling and muscle function. Infliximab, by reducing TNF-α levels, is hypothesized to mitigate the kinase cascades that disrupt normal CaMKII, RyR1, and SERCA function (Antuña et al., 2022). Preclinical studies also indicate that anti-TNF-α therapies modulate the NF-κB pathway in muscle tissues; for example, infliximab treatment in dystrophic mouse models has been associated with reductions in NF-κB subunit translocation and protection of type II muscle fibers, which are essential for rapid contraction and are prevalently affected in conditions involving muscle wasting (Stratos et al., 2022). Thus, the molecular interactions – through binding TNF-α, inhibiting NF-κB signaling, and potentially normalizing Ca²⁺ signaling – provide a comprehensive rationale for the repurposed use of infliximab in targeting the multifactorial pathology of sarcopenia.

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay, infliximab is expected to exert a multifaceted therapeutic effect on aged muscle. By neutralizing chronic low-grade TNF-α, infliximab should prevent the cytokine-induced activation of NF-κB, a key transcriptional regulator of muscle catabolism. It is anticipated that with reduced NF-κB signaling, the expression of muscle atrophy-promoting genes will decrease, thereby favoring a shift toward muscle protein synthesis and regeneration rather than degradation (Dhaliwal et al., 2021). Additionally, by intercepting the kinase cascades initiated by TNF-α – notably those involving CaMKII – infliximab is expected to stabilize the function of RyR1 and SERCA. This would result in an improvement in the amplitude and kinetics of Ca²⁺ transients in muscle fibers, which are critical for efficient excitation–contraction coupling. Sufficient evidence indicates that TNF-α is implicated in impairing muscle Ca²⁺ handling; thus, its neutralization might restore normal calcium signaling and subsequently enhance muscle contractility and strength (Subramaniam et al., 2015). In experimental settings, the restoration of muscle force has been observed in animal models following TNF-α blockade. For instance, in rat models of traumatic muscle injury, administration of infliximab led to improved muscle force recovery, reduced apoptosis, and enhanced preservation of muscle architecture, as shown by increased myofiber diameters and reduced inflammatory infiltrates (Stratos et al., 2022). Although these studies were conducted in the context of acute muscle injury rather than age-related sarcopenia, the underlying pathological mechanisms involving TNF-α and NF-κB appear to be shared, suggesting that the outcomes of normalizing Ca²⁺ transient dynamics and attenuating cytokine-driven catabolic pathways will be beneficial in sarcopenic muscle as well. Moreover, infliximab’s demonstrated ability to increase muscle volume in patients with inflammatory bowel disease provides additional support for its potential to counteract muscle wasting and improve functional outcomes in sarcopenia through the rebalancing of excitation–contraction coupling (Subramaniam et al., 2015).

Overall Evaluation:
Infliximab emerges as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia based on its extensive clinical use in chronic inflammatory diseases, its well-characterized pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, and its robust mechanism of action targeting TNF-α-driven inflammatory pathways. One significant strength of infliximab is its established history with proven human pharmacokinetics and tolerability over years of clinical use in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease (Subramaniam et al., 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b). Its ability to penetrate muscle tissue – demonstrated indirectly in studies on inflammatory myopathies and muscle wasting in Crohn’s disease – further supports its candidacy for treating sarcopenia. The mechanism by which infliximab neutralizes TNF-α has considerable therapeutic relevance; by suppressing TNF-α, the drug prevents the chronic activation of the NF-κB pathway, thereby reducing the expression of muscle atrophy-related genes. Aside from reducing protein degradation, the expected normalization of Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and kinetics through improved regulation of RyR1 and SERCA suggests that infliximab could restore proper excitation–contraction coupling and enhance muscle strength in aged individuals (Antuña et al., 2022; Stratos et al., 2022).

However, several weaknesses also need to be carefully considered. Despite compelling preclinical evidence and indirect clinical data from inflammatory conditions with muscle wasting components, there is currently a lack of direct clinical trials assessing the efficacy of infliximab for primary sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Furthermore, studies in dystrophic muscle models have indicated that TNF-α blockade can have complex effects; while low doses of TNF blockers may improve skeletal muscle strength and reduce fibrosis, higher doses risk adversely affecting cardiac function due to off-target impacts on growth signaling and compensatory hypertrophy (Ermolova et al., 2014). In addition, the dual role of TNF-α in muscle physiology – where it may contribute to both muscle repair and muscle degradation depending on context and concentration – demands a careful titration of therapeutic dosing to achieve beneficial effects without inadvertently impairing physiological regeneration processes (Mourkioti & Rosenthal, 2008). Finally, while the proposed mechanism involving normalization of CaMKII/NF-κB-mediated dysregulation of RyR1 and SERCA is plausible and supported by biochemical insights, direct evidence linking infliximab to improved Ca²⁺ signaling kinetics in aged or sarcopenic muscle remains to be fully elucidated, and further mechanistic studies would be warranted (Dhaliwal et al., 2021).

In summary, infliximab offers a robust biochemical and clinical rationale for repurposing as a therapy for sarcopenia. Its ability to neutralize chronic TNF-α, thereby suppressing the downstream NF-κB-driven catabolic pathways as well as potentially normalizing aberrant Ca²⁺ signaling via reduced CaMKII activity, positions it as a viable candidate. The strengths of existing safety data, proven efficacy in inflammatory conditions, and mechanistic plausibility are tempered by the need for dedicated clinical trials in sarcopenia populations, careful dosing strategies to avoid adverse cardiac effects, and further clarification of its impact on muscle calcium handling. Overall, while challenges remain, the preclinical and clinical literature reviewed supports infliximab as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for further investigation in the treatment of sarcopenia (Subramaniam et al., 2015; Stratos et al., 2022; Antuña et al., 2022).
