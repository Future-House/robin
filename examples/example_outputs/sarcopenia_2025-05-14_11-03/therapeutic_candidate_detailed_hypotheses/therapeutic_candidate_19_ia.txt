Proposal for IA-65 (ORAI1 agonist)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
IA-65 is a small, cell‐permeant synthetic molecule identified through high‐throughput screening efforts aimed at discovering potentiators of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) specifically mediated by the ORAI1 channel. Structurally described as 4-((5-phenyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)thiazol-2-yl)amino)benzoic acid, IA-65 belongs to a class of synthetic small-molecule modulators that target ion channels and regulate Ca²⁺ influx. Its design reflects an innovative strategy in drug development whereby prior screening campaigns were repurposed to identify compounds that selectively enhance ORAI1-mediated SOCE without significantly affecting related ORAI isoforms such as ORAI2 and ORAI3. This candidate is emerging from recent pharmacological efforts targeting the molecular machinery underlying Ca²⁺ homeostasis in skeletal muscle, and its synthesis likely involved medicinal chemistry optimization designed to improve cellular permeability, selectivity for ORAI1, and favorable in vitro ADME properties. Previous work in this class has predominantly focused on inhibitors of SOCE to counteract pathological Ca²⁺ overload; however, IA-65 represents a novel approach that aims to enhance rather than suppress Ca²⁺ entry, thereby addressing a mechanistic deficit observed in aging skeletal muscle (Lilliu et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
To date, the biochemical and pharmacological characterization of IA-65 has been performed primarily in heterologous expression systems as well as in vascular smooth muscle cells and skeletal muscle fibers ex vivo. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that IA-65 increases ORAI1-mediated Ca²⁺ currents in a concentration-dependent manner, with an effective concentration (EC₅₀) around 2 µM, and in rat skinned extensor digitorum longus (EDL) fibers, a concentration of 10 µM yielded an enhancement in Ca²⁺ influx by approximately 20–30%. Despite these promising in vitro and ex vivo findings, there is, at present, no record in the available literature of IA-65 being used in any clinical or veterinary setting, nor has it been directly tested in human subjects for sarcopenia or similar age-related muscle diseases. Moreover, broader therapeutic applications for this class of ORAI1 agonists remain largely experimental; although modulation of SOCE and specifically targeting the ORAI1 channel have been explored in muscle pathophysiology, previous studies have concentrated on inhibition rather than activation of these pathways, making IA-65 a novel candidate in its therapeutic approach. As such, while its potential for treating conditions related to deficient SOCE—such as sarcopenia—is theoretically sound, the translational research necessary for clinical validation is still in preliminary phases (Lilliu et al., 2021; Conte et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action for IA-65 is centered on its selective agonism of the ORAI1 channel, a critical component of SOCE in skeletal muscle. Under normal physiological conditions, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) stores Ca²⁺ that is released during muscle contraction via excitation–contraction (EC) coupling, primarily mediated by ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR1), with the consequent depletion of SR Ca²⁺ triggering activation of SOCE. In this regulatory circuit, STIM1 functions as a Ca²⁺ sensor in the SR; upon detecting Ca²⁺ depletion, STIM1 undergoes a conformational change, oligomerizes, and redistributes to regions near the plasma membrane or transverse tubules, where it physically interacts with the ORAI1 channel to gate its opening and allow extracellular Ca²⁺ influx. IA-65 enhances this process by binding selectively to ORAI1, thereby increasing the channel’s conductance and accelerating the rate of Ca²⁺ influx through SOCE. Importantly, IA-65 exhibits selectivity for ORAI1 without appreciable activation of ORAI2 or ORAI3 isoforms, which minimizes potential off-target effects associated with non-selective Ca²⁺ channel modulation. At the molecular level, the interaction of IA-65 with ORAI1 is thought to facilitate a conformational state akin to that produced by STIM1 activation, possibly stabilizing the open state of ORAI1 channels and accelerating calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI), which is a regulatory mechanism that prevents excessive Ca²⁺ influx during prolonged stimulation. The biochemical interactions underlying this modulation involve a precise binding of IA-65 to allosteric sites on ORAI1 that alter gating kinetics without disrupting the overall structural integrity of the channel complex. This mechanism aligns with the known biochemistry of SOCE, wherein a delicate balance between Ca²⁺ entry and inactivation is crucial for re-establishing Ca²⁺ homeostasis after muscle contraction and for safeguarding against Ca²⁺ toxicity (Lilliu et al., 2021; Conte et al., 2021; Michelucci et al., 2018).

Expected Effect:
In the context of aged human myotubes, the expected effect of IA-65 is to enhance ORAI1-mediated SOCE, thereby accelerating the refilling of SR Ca²⁺ stores following contraction. In skeletal muscle, efficient SR Ca²⁺ replenishment is paramount for sustaining subsequent Ca²⁺ transients that are vital for muscle contraction, particularly during repetitive or high-frequency stimulation. In aged muscle tissue, alterations in SOCE have been linked to diminished SR Ca²⁺ refilling, leading to a decrease in contraction amplitude and an increase in muscle fatigue—a hallmark of sarcopenia. By selectively potentiating ORAI1 currents, IA-65 is hypothesized to restore efficient Ca²⁺ influx, thereby overcoming the age-related deficits observed in SOCE. In preclinical studies, compromised SOCE resulting from impaired ORAI1 function has been associated with muscle weakness and fatigue, whereas enhancement of SOCE has been shown to improve muscle performance and fatigue resistance. Therefore, in an assay employing aged human myotubes, IA-65 would be expected to result in a measurable increase in the amplitude of Ca²⁺ transients following electrical stimulation, reflective of an increased rate of SR Ca²⁺ store refilling. This increased Ca²⁺ transient amplitude would, in turn, contribute to improved contractile function and resistance to fatigue over repeated contractions. The expression of ORAI1 in skeletal muscle is well documented, and its pivotal role in mediating SOCE in muscle fibers supports the hypothesis that targeting this channel could yield functional improvements in aged muscle cells (Conte et al., 2021; Dong & Maturana, 2025; Terrell et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, IA-65 emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia based on its mechanistic rationale and preclinical profile, yet several factors must be carefully considered.
Strengths:
• Mechanistic Specificity – IA-65 is designed to selectively activate ORAI1 and enhance SOCE, a pathway that is critically impaired in aged skeletal muscle. The specificity for ORAI1 over other isoforms like ORAI2 and ORAI3 minimizes the risk of unintended Ca²⁺ dysregulation in non-muscle tissues (Lilliu et al., 2021).
• Targeting a Validated Mechanism – The underlying hypothesis is predicated on robust preclinical evidence linking SOCE dysfunction to insufficient SR Ca²⁺ replenishment in aging and the resultant muscle fatigue observed in sarcopenia. Enhancing ORAI1 function directly addresses a fundamental deficit in aged muscle, potentially restoring Ca²⁺ transients and contractile function (Conte et al., 2021; Dong & Maturana, 2025).
• Innovative Channel Activation Approach – While many compounds act as SOCE inhibitors, IA-65 represents a unique approach by acting as an agonist to increase Ca²⁺ influx, which could be highly beneficial in conditions where reduced Ca²⁺ entry contributes to muscle weakness (Lilliu et al., 2021).
• Favorable In Vitro ADME Profile – Preliminary data indicate that IA-65 possesses favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties in vitro, potentially facilitating its translation from bench to bedside once further validated (Lilliu et al., 2021).

Weaknesses and Challenges:
• Limited Clinical Data – Despite promising preclinical findings, IA-65 has not yet been tested in clinical or veterinary settings. The lack of clinical trials or extensive in vivo data specifically examining its effects on muscle contraction and fatigue resistance in aged subjects presents a gap that must be addressed before further development (Lilliu et al., 2021).
• Risk of Calcium Overload – While enhancing Ca²⁺ influx through ORAI1 can be beneficial for SR refilling, excessive calcium entry could potentially lead to cytotoxicity or aberrant Ca²⁺ signaling, particularly given the fine balance required for normal muscle function. Appropriate dosing strategies and thorough preclinical toxicological studies are essential to mitigate this risk (Conte et al., 2021; Michelucci et al., 2018).
• Complex Regulation of SOCE – Skeletal muscle Ca²⁺ homeostasis is regulated by a network of proteins including STIM1, ORAI1, and TRPC channels, along with other Ca²⁺ handling proteins such as SERCA and calsequestrin. The potential for compensatory mechanisms or differential effects in various muscle fiber types may complicate the overall therapeutic impact of ORAI1 agonism (Conte et al., 2021; Terrell et al., 2023).
• Lack of In Vivo Efficacy Data – While in vitro studies suggest that IA-65 can enhance ORAI1-mediated Ca²⁺ currents, further studies in animal models of muscle aging are necessary to confirm that such enhancements translate into improved muscle function, increased endurance, and reduced fatigue in the context of sarcopenia (Dong & Maturana, 2025; Michelucci et al., 2018).
• Potential Off-Target Effects – Given that ORAI1 is expressed in various tissues including immune cells, there is a possibility that systemic administration of an ORAI1 agonist could have unintended effects in non-muscular tissues. This necessitates careful evaluation of tissue specificity and potential side effects during further drug development (Lilliu et al., 2021).

In summary, IA-65 represents an innovative and mechanism-based approach to treating sarcopenia by specifically enhancing ORAI1-mediated SOCE and thereby addressing the deficit in SR Ca²⁺ replenishment that contributes to muscle fatigue in the elderly. Its selective activation of ORAI1, favorable in vitro ADME properties, and the strong scientific rationale linking impaired SOCE to sarcopenia collectively support its further investigation as a therapeutic candidate. Nonetheless, the current limitations in clinical data, potential for calcium overload, and the inherent complexity of Ca²⁺ signaling in skeletal muscle underscore the need for comprehensive preclinical studies to validate its safety, efficacy, and long-term benefit in aged muscle models before advancing to clinical trials (Lilliu et al., 2021; Conte et al., 2021; Dong & Maturana, 2025). Overall, IA-65 holds promise as an innovative candidate targeting a validated sarcopenia mechanism, but its future as a repurposed therapeutic will require rigorous evaluation through detailed biochemical, in vivo, and eventually clinical studies.
