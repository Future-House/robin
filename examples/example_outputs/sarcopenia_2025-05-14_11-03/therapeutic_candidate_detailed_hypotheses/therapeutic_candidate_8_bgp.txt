Proposal for BGP-15 (O-(3-piperidino-2-hydroxy-1-propyl)nicotinic acid amidoxime)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
BGP-15, chemically designated as O-(3-piperidino-2-hydroxy-1-propyl)nicotinic acid amidoxime, is a small molecular entity originally discovered as an insulin sensitizer by Hungarian researchers and later repurposed as a heat shock protein (HSP) co‐inducer with broad cytoprotective activities (Pető et al., 2020, pp. 1–3). It belongs to a class of synthetic small molecules that target cellular stress pathways by modulating chaperone induction, and these compounds have been used principally in metabolic disorders, cardiomyopathies, and neuromuscular disease models (Campelj et al., 2020, pp. 1–3). BGP-15 is synthesized via chemical derivatization processes that yield a nicotinic amidoxime derivative with favorable physicochemical properties, including moderate molecular weight and high water solubility, which collectively facilitate oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetic stability (Pető et al., 2020, pp. 1–3). The compound is categorized within the broader therapeutic class of HSP co‐inducers—a group of molecules that, rather than directly inhibiting a pathological target, promote the cellular capacity to resist stress by upregulating endogenous chaperone proteins such as HSP70 and HSP90 (Budzyński et al., 2017, pp. 1–2). Previous studies of compounds within this class suggest that they can mitigate proteotoxic stress, improve protein folding and repair, and thereby preserve cellular function during states of metabolic or inflammatory injury (Pető et al., 2020, pp. 1–3).

Therapeutic History:
BGP-15 has been evaluated extensively in preclinical models of several diseases including type 2 diabetes, heart failure, and various myopathies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and chemotherapy-induced cachexia (Campelj et al., 2020, pp. 22–24; Nascimento et al., 2020, pp. 1–2). In diabetic animal models, the molecule has demonstrated the ability to improve insulin sensitivity, presumably via amelioration of systemic oxidative stress and improved mitochondrial function (Pető et al., 2020, pp. 1–3). In models of heart failure and atrial fibrillation, BGP-15 has been shown to reduce oxidative stress, partly by modulating mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhancing contractile function (Pető et al., 2020, pp. 8–10). Importantly, in neuromuscular applications, BGP-15 has been repurposed for studies in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, where its administration improved dystrophic pathology and extended survival in mdx and dko mice by means of heat shock protein induction and stabilization of cellular proteins (Gehrig et al., 2012, pp. 3–4). Although BGP-15 has not been directly tested in dedicated clinical trials for sarcopenia, its extensive preclinical evaluation in muscle-wasting conditions such as ventilation-induced diaphragm dysfunction, mechanical silencing-induced atrophy, and chemotherapy-induced muscle damage renders it a compelling candidate for further investigation in age-related muscle wasting (Campelj et al., 2020, pp. 1–3; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
BGP-15 functions primarily as a heat shock protein co‐inducer, acting through the modulation of the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) that drives the expression of critical chaperones, specifically HSP70 (also referred to as HSP72) and HSP90 (Nascimento et al., 2020, pp. 1–2). The underlying mechanism involves a mild, non-proteotoxic stress signal that triggers HSF1 activation via Rac1-mediated signaling pathways and a consequent NADPH oxidase activation, ultimately leading to de-repression of HSP gene expression (Nascimento et al., 2020, pp. 1–2). Additionally, BGP-15 has been shown to inhibit poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), thereby preventing the deleterious consequences of excessive PARP activation such as mitochondrial dysfunction and energetic collapse, which are common in conditions of cellular stress (Campelj et al., 2020, pp. 24–25). It also displays properties of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition, enhancing chromatin accessibility at stress-responsive gene loci and further expediting HSP induction (Budzyński et al., 2017, pp. 1–2). A particularly innovative aspect of its mechanism is the chaperone-mediated stabilization of key sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) proteins, including SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase) and RyR1 (ryanodine receptor 1), which are critical for calcium handling in skeletal muscle (Gehrig et al., 2012, p. 3). HSP70, whose expression is increased by BGP-15, has been directly associated with the preservation of SERCA activity under oxidative stress conditions by preventing detrimental post-translational modifications, thereby sustaining effective calcium uptake into the SR (Gehrig et al., 2012, pp. 3, 6). Consequently, the stabilization of SERCA and potentially RyR1 by HSP-mediated chaperone activity is expected to normalize Ca2⁺ transients in aged myotubes, reducing pathological SR Ca2⁺ leak and improving contractile efficiency (Terrell et al., 2023, pp. 6–7). This mechanism differentiates BGP-15 from direct channel agonists or antioxidants; rather, it uses an indirect, chaperone-driven approach to enforce proteostasis and functional stabilization of critical calcium-handling proteins (Pető et al., 2020, pp. 8–10).

Expected Effect:
In the context of sarcopenia, the expected effect of BGP-15 is to enhance muscle strength and quality by addressing a core pathogenic hallmark—dysregulated calcium signaling. A robust induction of heat shock proteins, particularly HSP70 and HSP90, is anticipated to stabilize SR Ca2⁺ handling proteins (SERCA and RyR1) in aged skeletal muscle fibers, thus promoting efficient calcium uptake during muscle relaxation and minimizing aberrant calcium leak that impairs contractile function (Gehrig et al., 2012, p. 3; Nascimento et al., 2018, pp. 4–5). This stabilization is expected to result in the normalization of Ca2⁺ transient amplitude and kinetics, which are crucial for excitation–contraction coupling in myotubes, thereby improving muscle force generation and fatigue resistance (Nascimento et al., 2018, pp. 1–2; Terrell et al., 2023, pp. 6–7). In vitro assays using aged myotubes are predicted to show increased expression of HSP70 and HSP90 as early biomarkers following BGP-15 treatment (Nascimento et al., 2020, pp. 1–2). Furthermore, the augmented chaperone activity should also protect against proteotoxic stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby indirectly preserving the integrity of other muscle contractile proteins (Ohlen et al., 2017, p. 6). The hypothesis supports that the drug will enhance SR Ca2⁺ uptake efficiency by stabilizing SERCA conformation, reduce pathological calcium leak through RyR1 stabilization, and ultimately improve the amplitude and kinetics of calcium transients, which translates biochemically into improved muscle contractility and a potential reversal of sarcopenic degeneration (Campelj et al., 2020, pp. 22–24; Terrell et al., 2023, pp. 6–7).

Overall Evaluation:
The accumulated literature provides substantial preclinical evidence that BGP-15 is a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for treating sarcopenia due to its multifaceted mechanism of action centered on heat shock protein co-induction. One of the main strengths of BGP-15 lies in its ability to upregulate HSP70 and HSP90 via the activation of HSF1, thereby conferring cytoprotection and stabilization of key muscle proteins which suffer from age-dependent dysfunction. The chaperone-mediated stabilization of SERCA and RyR1 is particularly relevant, as calcium mishandling is a well-established contributor to sarcopenia pathology; maintaining proper SR Ca²⁺ handling can ameliorate contractile deficits and promote muscle repair (Gehrig et al., 2012, p. 3; Terrell et al., 2023, pp. 6–7). Another strength is BGP-15’s favorable pharmacokinetic profile, attributable to its small molecular weight and oral bioavailability, as well as encouraging safety signals from Phase I clinical trials in populations with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (Pető et al., 2020, pp. 1–3; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, BGP-15’s mechanism, which utilizes indirect chaperone activation rather than direct inhibition or blockade of calcium channels, may allow for broader maintenance of proteostasis in aging muscle—an advantage over therapies that target only one aspect of calcium signaling or oxidative stress (Pető et al., 2020, pp. 8–10; Budzyński et al., 2017, pp. 1–2).

However, there are several weaknesses and gaps in the current evidence base. First, despite promising results in animal models of muscular dystrophy, chemotherapy-induced myopathy, and ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction, there is insufficient direct clinical data demonstrating efficacy specifically in sarcopenia (Campelj et al., 2020, pp. 1–3; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The translation of efficacy from other muscle-wasting conditions to age-related sarcopenia is plausible but remains to be validated in targeted clinical trials addressing the unique pathophysiological aspects of sarcopenia. In addition, while the hypothesis regarding the stabilization of SERCA and RyR1 is supported by the role of HSP70 in preserving SERCA function under oxidative stress, direct biochemical data on the modulation of these proteins by BGP-15 in aged myotubes are limited (Gehrig et al., 2012, p. 3; Nascimento et al., 2020, pp. 1–2). Furthermore, some studies in chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting have indicated paradoxical effects, including cytoskeletal remodeling and protein synthesis attenuation under certain conditions, which may warrant cautious interpretation when extrapolating to the sarcopenia context (Campelj et al., 2020, pp. 24–25). Finally, while BGP-15 has been shown to be safe in early phase clinical investigations for metabolic indications, comprehensive long-term safety and efficacy data in an elderly population, which is the primary target for sarcopenia treatment, are not yet available (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In summary, the therapeutic candidate BGP-15 represents a novel chaperone-mediated approach to treating sarcopenia, leveraging mechanisms that stabilize key calcium-handling proteins and promote cellular stress resilience through HSP induction. Its established efficacy in related muscle-wasting disease models, alongside favorable pharmacokinetics and safety profiles from early clinical studies, underscore its potential. Nonetheless, the lack of direct clinical evidence in sarcopenia and incomplete mechanistic data regarding its interaction with specific SR proteins (SERCA and RyR1) call for further preclinical research and well-designed clinical trials to validate its efficacy in aging muscle (Campelj et al., 2020, pp. 22–24; Nascimento et al., 2018, pp. 1–2; Pető et al., 2020, pp. 8–10; Terrell et al., 2023, pp. 6–7).
