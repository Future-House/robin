Proposal for Myricetin (Sigma-Aldrich M-7379)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Myricetin is a naturally occurring flavonoid, originally isolated from various fruits, vegetables, and medicinal plants, and available commercially (Sigma-Aldrich M-7379). As a member of the flavonoid subclass, myricetin shares structural and functional characteristics with other polyphenolic compounds that have long been investigated for their antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties. Flavonoids as a class have been utilized for a range of biomedical applications due to their ability to penetrate cells, modulate signaling pathways, and mitigate oxidative stress. The compound's natural origin means that historical safety data is relatively abundant. The flavonoid scaffold of myricetin enhances cell permeability as well as allows for modifications to improve its pharmacokinetic profiles. Previous studies using cell‐based, animal, and biochemical models have shown that flavonoids can positively affect muscle physiology through antioxidant properties and by modulating mitochondrial function, making them attractive candidates for repurposing in muscle wasting conditions such as sarcopenia (Shen et al., 2019; Nikawa et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, flavonoids have been associated with numerous therapeutic indications and have been studied in various contexts, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory diseases. Within the scope of muscle health, several flavonoids – such as quercetin, epicatechin, and resveratrol – have been shown in preclinical models to alleviate muscle atrophy, improve mitochondrial biogenesis, and enhance contractile performance. Although myricetin itself has not been extensively documented in clinical trials for sarcopenia specifically, its structural class has demonstrated benefits in related muscle aging contexts. Clinical trial searches using the terms “Myricetin OR RyR1 OR flavonoid AND sarcopenia” have returned 21 relevant studies, indicating that research is active in exploring flavonoids or RyR1 modulators in the context of muscle degeneration and aging (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, related studies on natural constituents have reported that compounds similar to myricetin can enhance mitochondrial function and endurance, as seen with other flavonoids in animal models (Shen et al., 2019; Nikawa et al., 2021). This existing body of work lends indirect support to repurposing myricetin for sarcopenia, especially considering its favorable safety profile and bioavailability enhancements achieved with novel formulations (Shen et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
Recent high-throughput FRET screening experiments have identified myricetin as a molecule capable of modulating the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) in skeletal muscle. RyR1 is the critical calcium (Ca2+) release channel within the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), essential for excitation–contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal myofibers. In aged muscle, RyR1 dysfunction frequently manifests as pathological Ca2+ leak from the SR, leading to reduced Ca2+ transient amplitude and impaired muscle contractility. Detailed mechanistic work by Rebbeck et al. (2020) has demonstrated that myricetin increases fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency in assays measuring calmodulin (CaM) binding to RyR1, suggesting that the flavonoid stabilizes a conformation of the receptor more favorable for CaM interaction (Rebbeck et al., 2020). Functionally, myricetin was shown to reduce pathological SR Ca2+ leak in mechanically skinned human skeletal muscle fibers, an effect correlated with decreased [3H]ryanodine binding in functional receptor assays (Rebbeck et al., 2020). This inhibitory effect on RyR1 appears to be dose dependent, with low micromolar concentrations of myricetin diminishing aberrant Ca2+ leak while sparing or even modestly modulating normal EC coupling under physiological conditions (Rebbeck et al., 2020). The specificity of myricetin for the skeletal muscle isoform (RyR1) over the cardiac isoform (RyR2) is particularly promising, as it minimizes risks of adverse off-target cardiac effects. The biochemical mechanism appears to be mediated by an allosteric modulation whereby myricetin enhances calmodulin binding to RyR1, thereby suppressing the pathological open state of the channel without interfering significantly with fundamental regulatory interactions, such as those involving FKBP12 (Rebbeck et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
Based on the current mechanistic understanding, the expected effect of myricetin in aged human myotubes is the reduction of pathological SR Ca2+ leak through improved stabilization of RyR1 by calmodulin. This should, in turn, restore or amplify stimulus-evoked Ca2+ transient amplitude and ultimately boost contractile force – a significant clinical endpoint in the treatment of sarcopenia. In skeletal muscle, RyR1 is robustly expressed and functionally crucial for efficient calcium mobilization during muscle contraction (and its dysregulation is well-documented in the pathophysiology of sarcopenia). The hypothesis posits that myricetin, through its direct interaction with RyR1, allosterically enhances CaM binding, thus normalizing Ca2+ homeostasis in aged myotubes. With reduced SR Ca2+ leak, myricetin-treated muscle fibers should exhibit improved calcium transient amplitude upon electrical stimulation, resulting in increased contractile force (Rebbeck et al., 2020). Importantly, this mechanism is distinct from the generic antioxidant effects seen with many flavonoids, as it directly targets a critical muscle excitation–contraction pathway; this is supported by studies showing that similar compounds, such as quercetin, have had beneficial effects on muscle performance via multiple pathways, further reinforcing the potential effectiveness of myricetin’s RyR1-targeted mechanism (Nikawa et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, myricetin emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of sarcopenia based on a strong mechanistic rationale and supportive preclinical data. One significant strength is its demonstrated ability to stabilize RyR1 conformations in a manner that reduces pathological Ca2+ leak – a key pathological feature in aged muscle that contributes to decreased contractile performance. The specificity of its action, favoring RyR1 without significantly affecting RyR2, is particularly advantageous given the need to avoid adverse cardiac effects. The flavonoid's naturally derived scaffold, which has been associated with favorable cell penetration and modifiable pharmacokinetics, further supports its potential repurposing. Additionally, high-throughput FRET-based screening and functional assays in mechanically skinned human muscle fibers have provided direct evidence of its efficacy in modulating key components of the excitation–contraction machinery (Rebbeck et al., 2020).

However, several challenges remain that must be addressed. First, while preclinical models have provided promising proof-of-concept data, there is a significant gap in clinical data regarding myricetin's effectiveness in sarcopenia. ClinicalTrials.gov searches indicate that although related compounds and pathways are under investigation, there is no dedicated clinical trial evaluating myricetin in sarcopenia specifically (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Second, the exact pharmacokinetic profile of myricetin in human muscle tissue remains inadequately characterized, bringing some uncertainty to its potential systemic efficacy when repurposed for long-term treatment of muscle degeneration. The compound’s metabolism and bioavailability improvements have been addressed in preclinical formulations, but direct clinical translations of these modifications need further validation (Shen et al., 2019). Lastly, while mechanistic studies support its role in modulating RyR1 and CaM binding, additional research is warranted to investigate whether these in vitro effects translate to significant functional improvements in contractile force and muscle strength in aged human subjects—a critical endpoint for any sarcopenia therapy.

Overall, myricetin leverages a unique mechanism of action that directly addresses an underlying pathophysiological process in muscle aging—the pathological SR Ca2+ leak through RyR1. The data support that by enhancing calmodulin binding, myricetin can stabilize RyR1 function, thereby potentially restoring proper calcium handling and improving muscle contractile performance. Its natural flavonoid nature, existing safety profile, and ability to penetrate cells make it an attractive repurposed candidate for sarcopenia. However, further detailed pharmacokinetic studies, alongside dedicated clinical trials, are required to establish its efficacy and safety in the context of age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction. These future studies should focus on quantifying improvements in calcium transient amplitude, contractile force, and overall muscle performance in aged myotubes and human subjects. Considering both its mechanistic promise and the current gaps in clinical translation, myricetin stands out as a scientifically rational candidate that merits further investigation. Additional comprehensive research could pave the way for its repurposing as a novel therapeutic agent to counteract sarcopenia, addressing a critical unmet need in an aging population (Rebbeck et al., 2020; Nikawa et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
