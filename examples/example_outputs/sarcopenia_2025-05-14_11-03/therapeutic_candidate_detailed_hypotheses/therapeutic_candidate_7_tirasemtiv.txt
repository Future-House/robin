Proposal for Tirasemtiv

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tirasemtiv is a small‐molecule drug discovered through high‐throughput screening and subsequent chemical optimization efforts aimed at identifying compounds with high potency and favorable metabolic stability. It belongs to a class of therapeutic agents known as fast skeletal muscle troponin activators (FSTA). These compounds are designed to bind selectively to the fast skeletal troponin complex, primarily troponin C (sTnC), and to increase muscle fiber sensitivity to calcium ions (Ca²⁺) during the excitation–contraction process. The discovery and chemical characterization of tirasemtiv are well documented; structure–activity relationship studies identified key substituents, such as the optimum 3‐pentyl group and an ethynyl modification that conferred high potency and favorable pharmacokinetic attributes (Collibee et al., 2018). Historically, compounds of this class have been developed to target muscle weakness in neuromuscular diseases by acting directly on the contractile apparatus rather than on upstream neurological inputs. Owing to its oral bioavailability and established ADME characteristics, tirasemtiv is an attractive candidate for repurposing for other forms of muscle dysfunction, such as sarcopenia, even though its initial development was directed at diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015).

Therapeutic History:
Tirasemtiv’s primary history of development has been in the context of ALS, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency due to motor neuron loss. Several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate its efficacy and safety in ALS patients. Notably, Phase II and Phase III trials—such as those registered under ClinicalTrials.gov (2010–2012)—have generated extensive pharmacodynamic data demonstrating that tirasemtiv increases submaximal isometric muscle force, enhances endurance, and slows the decline in respiratory function, as measured by slow vital capacity (SVC) and other endpoints (Shefner et al., 2012; Hansen et al., 2014). Although its performance in large-scale ALS clinical endpoints has been mixed—with some trials not meeting all primary endpoints—there is clear proof-of-concept evidence that the drug modulates neuromuscular Ca²⁺ sensitivity and improves skeletal muscle performance (Alsulami & Marston, 2020). Importantly, no dedicated clinical trials for sarcopenia have been conducted, but the extensive history of clinical investigation in ALS, along with preclinical studies in animal models (e.g., the B6SJL-SOD1G93A mouse model), provides solid translational validation for its effects on skeletal muscle (Collibee et al., 2018; Hwee et al., 2014). The repurposing rationale for sarcopenia emerges from the recognition that both ALS and sarcopenia share a final common pathway of impaired skeletal muscle contractility and increased fatigability, even though the etiologies differ (ClinicalTrials.gov, search).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, tirasemtiv functions by selectively binding to the fast skeletal troponin C isoform. The binding event increases the sensitivity of troponin C to Ca²⁺, a critical element for actomyosin interaction during muscle contraction. Detailed structural studies using solution NMR and other biophysical techniques have shown that tirasemtiv fits into a hydrophobic pocket formed between troponin C and the switch region of troponin I (sTnI), thereby stabilizing the Ca²⁺-bound active conformation of the troponin complex (Li et al., 2021). This stabilization translates into a leftward shift in the calcium–force relationship (pCa shift), meaning lower concentrations of Ca²⁺ are required to trigger contractile force generation. Preclinical experiments have demonstrated that this increase in Ca²⁺ sensitivity amplifies submaximal isometric force production without elevating maximum force at full Ca²⁺ saturation (Hansen et al., 2014). This effect is of particular importance because most daily muscle activities operate at submaximal levels of stimulation, which are compromised in conditions like sarcopenia. The compound’s well-characterized pharmacodynamic profile establishes that by enhancing Ca²⁺ sensitivity via a direct molecular interaction with fast skeletal troponin C, tirasemtiv prolongs the force‐generating state of the actomyosin complex during nerve-evoked contractions (Hwang & Sykes, 2015). Moreover, the effect of tirasemtiv on muscle fibers has been confirmed in both in vitro and in vivo models, where increases in muscle endurance, grip strength, and respiratory muscle force (diaphragm function) have been recorded (Hwee et al., 2014; Collibee et al., 2018).

Expected Effect:
Based on tirasemtiv’s mechanism of action, the expected effect in sarcopenic muscle would be the restoration of twitch force and the reduction of muscle fatigue. In aged myotubes, where Ca²⁺ transient deficits and decreased contractile efficiency contribute to sarcopenia, tirasemtiv would selectively bind to fast skeletal troponin C and increase its Ca²⁺ affinity. This leads to an enhanced force‐generating response during neuromuscular stimulation. Preclinical studies in ALS models have shown that treatment with tirasemtiv results in measurable improvements in parameters such as submaximal isometric force, grip strength, rotarod performance, and respiratory function, all of which are proxies for increased muscle endurance and contractility (Hansen et al., 2014; Hwee et al., 2014). In the context of sarcopenia, a condition characterized by age-associated decline in muscle mass and function, similar improvements would be anticipated. Fast‐twitch fibers, which are more susceptible to sarcopenic atrophy, would benefit from the prolonged force‐generating state induced by tirasemtiv, thereby potentially restoring some degree of strength and reducing fatigue during repetitive submaximal contractions. This hypothesis is supported by the translational evidence from ALS trials, where a slowing of the decline in respiratory and limb muscle function was observed even in the presence of a compromised neuromuscular input (Shefner et al., 2021; Alsulami & Marston, 2020). In aged muscle, where fast skeletal troponin C is expressed in approximately 50–60% of the contractile proteins in the vulnerable fibers, the selective action of tirasemtiv could yield a significant functional benefit (ClinicalTrials.gov, search).

Overall Evaluation:
Tirasemtiv emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of sarcopenia based on its robust preclinical proof‐of‐concept and well-characterized mechanism of action. One of its primary strengths is the direct modulation of the muscle contractile apparatus by enhancing Ca²⁺ sensitivity via fast skeletal troponin C activation. This represents an orthogonal strategy compared to interventions that target sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ handling proteins such as SERCA or RyR. The oral bioavailability, established ADME profile, and extensive safety and tolerability data obtained from multiple ALS trials further underscore its potential for repurposing (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Collibee et al., 2018). In preclinical animal models, tirasemtiv has consistently demonstrated the capacity to increase submaximal muscle force, reduce fatigability, and improve overall muscle performance metrics such as grip strength and respiratory function (Hwee et al., 2014; Hansen et al., 2014). Translational studies in ALS patients have provided additional evidence that the drug’s mechanism can produce clinically meaningful improvements in muscle function—even if the broader disease-modifying outcomes in ALS were limited (Shefner et al., 2012; Rudnicki et al., 2021).

Nevertheless, there are notable weaknesses and challenges to consider. First, while extensive trials in ALS provide a strong pharmacodynamic rationale, sarcopenia has a fundamentally different pathophysiology from neurodegenerative muscle weakness. Sarcopenia is primarily an age-associated decline in muscle mass, quality, and function that may involve alterations in anabolic signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic low-level inflammation, and neuromuscular junction regression. Therefore, while tirasemtiv’s mechanism of enhancing muscle contractility is mechanistically plausible, direct evidence in aged populations or models of sarcopenia is lacking (Scaricamazza et al., 2021; Tarantino et al., 2022). Second, clinical trials in ALS have revealed tolerability issues (e.g., dizziness, gastrointestinal side effects, weight loss) that, although manageable in a more severely affected population, could limit long‐term use in elderly patients with sarcopenia who may have multiple comorbid conditions (Shefner et al., 2016). Third, although the modulation of fast skeletal troponin C offers a targeted and attractive approach, the robustness of the functional improvement in a sarcopenic state is yet to be confirmed in dedicated clinical studies. Finally, the possibility that the drug might not sufficiently address other facets of age‐related muscle degeneration that extend beyond impaired Ca²⁺ sensitivity—for example, reduced muscle regenerative capacity or insulin resistance—merits further investigation (Alsulami & Marston, 2020; Maragakis et al., 2023).

In summary, tirasemtiv demonstrates a solid mechanistic basis and favorable pharmacological profile that support its repurposing as a treatment for sarcopenia. It works by selectively binding to fast skeletal troponin C, thereby increasing Ca²⁺ sensitivity and prolonging the force‐generating state of the actomyosin complex, which should, in theory, restore twitch force and reduce fatigue in aged, sarcopenic muscle (Li et al., 2021; Hwang & Sykes, 2015). The preclinical validation in animal models of neuromuscular disease and the translational clinical data in ALS patients provide an encouraging rational basis for exploring its efficacy in restoring muscle function in the elderly. However, the transition from neurodegenerative muscle weakness to age‐related sarcopenia remains an area requiring cautious evaluation. Dedicated preclinical studies using aged animal models and subsequent phase II clinical trials in sarcopenic populations would be necessary to establish its efficacy, dosage, and safety profile in this new indication. The overall strengths of repurposing tirasemtiv lie in its oral administration, well‐documented ADME and tolerability profile, and verified mechanism of directly modulating muscle force generation. Its weaknesses, however, include the potential for untoward side effects in a frail population and the need for further evidence demonstrating that enhanced Ca²⁺ sensitivity alone can overcome the multifactorial nature of sarcopenia. Based on the comprehensive literature review, tirasemtiv is a promising candidate with a strong scientific rationale for treating sarcopenia, provided that upcoming targeted studies confirm its functional benefits in aged muscle and establish an acceptable risk–benefit ratio for elderly patients (Collibee et al., 2018; Shefner et al., 2021; Tarantino et al., 2022).
