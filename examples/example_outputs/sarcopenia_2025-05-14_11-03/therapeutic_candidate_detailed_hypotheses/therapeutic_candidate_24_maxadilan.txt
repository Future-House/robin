Proposal for Maxadilan

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Maxadilan is a peptide originally isolated from the salivary glands of the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis and is best characterized as a selective agonist of the pituitary adenylate cyclase–activating polypeptide (PACAP) type I receptor (PAC1) (Váczy et al., 2016). As a naturally derived peptide, it belongs to a unique class of bioactive peptides that modulate G protein–coupled receptors, and its structural attributes confer a prolonged half‐life relative to other peptides due to notable conformational constraints (Algarni, 2018). This class of compounds has been widely investigated in both neurobiology and vascular biology, where agents like PACAP itself have been studied for their neuroprotective and vasodilatory properties. In this context, maxadilan is of particular interest as it acts with high selectivity toward the PAC1 receptor, suggesting a capacity to engage signaling cascades that culminate in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and protein kinase A (PKA) activation (Mey et al., 2024). Its peptide nature allows for parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous) delivery, a route that is well‐established for many peptide drugs, though formulation stability and immunogenicity assessments will be necessary for long‐term administration.

Therapeutic History:
In earlier studies, maxadilan has primarily been evaluated in preclinical models focused on its vascular and neuroprotective effects. For instance, clinical investigations such as the trial NCT02355756 were designed to assess maxadilan’s pharmacodynamic effects – specifically using dermal blood flow as a biomarker for PAC1 receptor engagement – in healthy volunteers, thereby establishing target engagement and safety profiles (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Beyond these vascular endpoints, maxadilan’s use has been explored in experimental settings to gauge anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic responses in models of ischemia‐induced retinal degeneration, where its administration preserved cellular integrity via PAC1 receptor–mediated signaling (Váczy et al., 2016; Mey et al., 2024). Despite this relatively robust history in vascular and neurological settings, there is little to no direct evidence in the existing literature that maxadilan has previously been used to treat sarcopenia or similar muscle wasting disorders. Instead, the current body of evidence regarding skeletal muscle involvement has been largely derived from genetic studies – for example, investigations demonstrating that muscle-specific knockout of PAC1 (as reported in Li et al., 2023) can protect against disuse-induced atrophy – suggesting a role for PAC1 signaling in the regulation of muscle proteostasis rather than its direct activation. Thus, while maxadilan itself has not been directly tested in sarcopenia models, its ability to activate the PAC1 receptor positions it as a candidate for repurposing, with the notion that its effects on cAMP/PKA signaling may beneficially modulate intracellular mechanisms in aged muscle cells.

Mechanism of Action:
The proposed mechanism underlying maxadilan’s therapeutic benefit in sarcopenia centers on its high-affinity, selective agonism at the PAC1 receptor, a receptor which, when activated, couples primarily to the Gαs protein leading to robust stimulation of adenylate cyclase, increased intracellular cAMP levels, and subsequent activation of PKA (Hoover et al., 2013; Algarni, 2018). Activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling cascade is known to have wide-ranging effects in various tissues, including skeletal muscle, where PKA phosphorylates numerous downstream targets. Among these targets is phospholamban (PLN), a regulatory protein that, in its unphosphorylated state, binds to and inhibits the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump – the critical mediator of calcium reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) following muscle contraction (Syed, 2016). When PKA phosphorylates PLN, its inhibitory effect on SERCA is relieved, resulting in enhanced calcium reuptake into the SR; this facilitates more rapid clearance of cytosolic Ca²⁺ transients and ultimately improves muscle relaxation and contractile recovery (Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). The hypothesis posits that in aged myotubes – where SERCA activity may be compromised due to oxidative modifications and altered phospholamban regulation – the application of maxadilan will elevate cAMP levels sufficiently to drive PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PLN, thereby restoring optimal SERCA function. This improved calcium handling is anticipated to translate into better muscle contractility, reduced muscle weakness, and overall amelioration of sarcopenia-related functional decline. Notably, evidence for PACAP/PAC1 signaling enhancing SERCA function through similar mechanisms is available in vascular models (Syed, 2016) and is a strong biochemical rationale for exploring this pathway in skeletal muscle as well.

Expected Effect:
Under the therapeutic paradigm proposed, maxadilan is expected to exert its beneficial effects by engaging PAC1 receptors on aged skeletal muscle cells, particularly myotubes, thereby elevating intracellular cAMP levels and activating PKA (Hoover et al., 2013). The resultant PKA activity would phosphorylate phospholamban, attenuating its inhibitory interaction with SERCA (Syed, 2016). This biochemical cascade is predicted to lead to enhanced SR Ca²⁺ uptake and faster clearance of cytosolic Ca²⁺ transients, a process that is critical for proper muscle relaxation and contractile function (Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). In an in vitro assay using aged myotubes, one would anticipate observable increases in cAMP levels upon maxadilan treatment, coupled with measurable increases in PLN phosphorylation. In parallel, functional assessments – such as calcium imaging studies – should reveal a restoration of Ca²⁺ transient kinetics (i.e., quicker decay rates) that correlate with improved excitation–contraction coupling and muscle contractility. Additionally, this mechanism is supported by studies suggesting that proper SERCA function is crucial for muscle health and that pharmacologic enhancement of SERCA activity can counteract age-related muscle weakness (Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). Since the PAC1 receptor is expressed not only in neuronal and vascular tissues but also in skeletal muscle fibers (Algarni, 2018), the anticipated effect is well rooted in the known distribution of the receptor and its downstream signaling machinery. It is also relevant to note that robust cAMP signaling in muscle cells is associated with other beneficial effects, such as improved mitochondrial function and reduced pro-atrophic signaling, further supporting the expected therapeutic outcome.

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of maxadilan as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia presents a mixed but promising scenario. On the strength side, maxadilan’s high specificity for the PAC1 receptor and its ability to trigger potent cAMP/PKA activation provide a strong biochemical rationale for its use in modulating processes that are key to muscle contractility. The established mechanism – wherein PKA-mediated phosphorylation of phospholamban relieves SERCA inhibition – is a novel and attractive strategy for addressing the impaired calcium dynamics that underlie age-related deficits in muscle function (Syed, 2016; Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). Furthermore, the peptide’s prolonged half-life, resulting from its unique structural features, may offer practical advantages in a clinical setting by reducing dosing frequency and potentially enhancing patient compliance (Váczy et al., 2016). In addition, the successful use of PAC1 receptor agonists in other therapeutic areas – including neuroprotective and vascular applications as indicated by clinical trial data (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015) and preclinical studies (Mey et al., 2024) – supports the general feasibility of modulating this receptor pharmacologically.

However, there are several noteworthy weaknesses and uncertainties that must be addressed. First, while there is compelling biochemical rationale and supporting evidence from vascular and neuronal models, there is a significant gap in the direct preclinical evidence for maxadilan’s efficacy in skeletal muscle or sarcopenia models. Studies such as Li et al. (2023) have demonstrated that genetic manipulation of PAC1 signaling can influence muscle atrophy, yet these findings were based on receptor deficiency rather than agonism, raising questions about the context-specific roles of PAC1 in muscle tissue. This apparent paradox – where PAC1 receptor knockout appears protective in a disuse atrophy model – suggests that the role of PAC1 signaling in muscle homeostasis may be more complex than a straightforward linear activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway and may depend on disease context, receptor isoforms, or the balance of downstream signaling pathways. Additionally, the translation of findings from vascular and neuronal tissues to skeletal muscle is not guaranteed; differences in receptor density, downstream effectors, and microenvironmental factors could alter maxadilan’s efficacy in aged muscle (Algarni, 2018; Palace, 2014). The safety profile in the context of chronic administration for sarcopenia – a disease prevalent in the elderly – will require careful evaluation regarding potential off-target effects, particularly given the known vasodilatory actions of PAC1 agonists that might lead to hypotension if not properly titrated (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015).

Another potential challenge lies in the peptide nature of maxadilan; while peptides can be highly selective and potent, they are also subject to proteolytic degradation, immune recognition, and issues with bioavailability, although its structural robustness may mitigate some of these issues (Váczy et al., 2016). Moreover, the dosing regimen, optimal delivery method, and potential need for formulation enhancements (e.g., encapsulation, PEGylation) will be critical factors for its clinical translation. Lastly, the absence of any prior clinical use of maxadilan in the treatment of muscle weakness or sarcopenia means that preclinical efficacy studies in relevant muscle models – including aged animal models of sarcopenia – must be rigorously conducted before any clinical investigation can be justified.

In summary, maxadilan represents an innovative and mechanistically attractive candidate for repurposing as a sarcopenia therapeutic. Its ability to selectively activate the PAC1 receptor and thereby enhance cAMP/PKA signaling to promote phospholamban phosphorylation and restore SERCA-mediated calcium handling addresses a critical unmet need in aged muscle physiology (Syed, 2016; Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). However, the candidate’s development is currently based largely on indirect evidence borrowed from other therapeutic areas, and conflicting genetic data emphasizing the potential protective effects of PAC1 receptor deficiency in muscle raise important questions regarding the net benefit of receptor agonism versus antagonism in this context (Li et al., 2023). Before moving forward, comprehensive preclinical studies are required to validate the proposed mechanism in aged or sarcopenic muscle, to elucidate the context-dependent roles of PAC1 signaling, and to optimize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of maxadilan for chronic use in an elderly population. Overall, while the hypothesis is compelling and scientifically grounded, the evaluation underscores the need for further rigorous investigation to determine whether maxadilan can safely and effectively be repurposed to restore muscle function in sarcopenia.
