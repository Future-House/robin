Proposal for ML-9

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
ML-9 is a synthetic small‐molecule compound originally developed as an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and is chemically identified as 1-(5-chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine. It belongs to the aminopyridine and naphthalene sulphonamide class of compounds, which have been widely used in muscle biology research to dissect calcium‐dependent contraction mechanisms and cytoskeletal dynamics (Ito et al., 2004; Shi et al., 2007). Its synthesis typically involves forming a sulfonamide bond between chloronaphthalene sulfonyl chloride and a hexahydro-diazepine derivative, yielding a molecule that is both cell-permeable and capable of modulating intracellular signaling pathways. Historically, compounds in this class have been used as pharmacological tools to investigate MLCK functions as well as indirectly influencing calcium channel activities in smooth and skeletal muscle tissues (Martinsen et al., 2014; Xiong et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
ML-9 has been extensively used in experimental settings to inhibit MLCK and study its role in muscle contraction and calcium homeostasis. It has also been repurposed in various studies to modulate store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) by interfering with STIM1 oligomerization, a critical step necessary for activating Orai1 channels (Smyth et al., 2008; Shaikh et al., 2018). Although the compound’s historical use has predominantly been in vitro and in animal models to study calcium dynamics in muscle cells and other excitable tissues, there is limited clinical data regarding its direct use in treating sarcopenia or related muscle wasting conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, the mechanistic insights derived from its application in modulating STIM1 function and SOCE in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells provide a rationale for its potential repurposing in age-related muscle disorders such as sarcopenia (Conte et al., 2021a; Brotto et al., 2014).

Mechanism of Action:
ML-9’s primary mechanism involves the inhibition of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), reducing the phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain and thereby modulating actomyosin contractility (Ito et al., 2004; Shi et al., 2007). Beyond this classical role, recent studies have shown that ML-9 acts as an inhibitor of STIM1 oligomerization, a process essential for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) activation (Smyth et al., 2008). STIM1 is a calcium sensor located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that, upon detecting calcium store depletion, oligomerizes and translocates to areas near the plasma membrane to interact with Orai1 channels, forming puncta essential for SOCE. ML-9 disrupts this process by reversing STIM1 puncta formation, thereby inhibiting the subsequent calcium influx (Smyth et al., 2008; Shaikh et al., 2018). Biochemically, this action is thought to occur via direct interference with STIM1 conformational changes or its phosphorylation state, effectively lowering the amplitude of SOCE without completely abolishing calcium entry (Smyth et al., 2008). Additionally, ML-9 may exhibit MLCK-independent inhibition on certain calcium-permeable TRP channels as shown in studies involving TRPC6, although this effect appears to be separate from its action on STIM1 (Shi et al., 2007). As STIM1 is expressed in skeletal muscle and its proper function is critical for muscle contraction and differentiation, modulating STIM1-dependent SOCE could be a viable strategy for stabilizing intracellular Ca²⁺ dynamics in aged myotubes (Conte et al., 2021b; Kiviluoto et al., 2011).

Expected Effect:
The proposed hypothesis for repurposing ML-9 in sarcopenia is that by inhibiting STIM1 oligomerization, ML-9 can modulate the balance of store-operated Ca²⁺ entry. In aged skeletal muscle, aberrant STIM1 activity can lead to pathological Ca²⁺ influx, causing cytotoxic Ca²⁺ overload while also compromising sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) replenishment required for rapid calcium transients during contraction (Terrell et al., 2023). The expected effect of ML-9 is to reduce excessive SOCE activity, thereby preventing cytotoxic elevations in intracellular Ca²⁺ while still permitting sufficient Ca²⁺ entry for SR refilling. This balanced modulation aims to stabilize Ca²⁺ transient amplitudes and improve muscle function by maintaining calcium homeostasis. Since STIM1 is essential for muscle differentiation and contraction, normalizing its function rather than completely blocking it is critical (Conte et al., 2021a; Brotto et al., 2014). Furthermore, aged skeletal muscle often exhibits compensatory adaptations such as altered expression of SERCA pumps and other Ca²⁺-handling proteins that could be favorably modulated by a controlled reduction of SOCE (Conte et al., 2024; Dong & Maturana, 2025). In vitro assays using aged myotubes and ex vivo muscle preparations from aged animal models are expected to demonstrate improved SR Ca²⁺ replenishment, reduced basal Ca²⁺ overload, and improved contractile force upon treatment with ML-9.

Overall Evaluation:
ML-9 presents a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of sarcopenia based on its dual pharmacological actions. Its well-characterized inhibition of MLCK coupled with its demonstrated ability to disrupt STIM1 oligomerization positions it as a unique modulator of SOCE, an essential pathway in muscle Ca²⁺ homeostasis (Smyth et al., 2008; Shaikh et al., 2018). A significant strength of ML-9 is its defined cell permeability and the extensive body of literature supporting its effects on calcium dynamics in muscle cells, including its capability to reduce pathological Ca²⁺ influx while potentially preserving the necessary Ca²⁺ entry for SR replenishment (Conte et al., 2021a; Brotto et al., 2014). Its relatively well-known off-target profile and historical use as a research tool give it a favorable background for mechanistic studies in the context of aging muscle (Harteneck & Gollasch, 2011; Ito et al., 2004).

However, there are several challenges and weaknesses that need to be addressed. First, while ML-9 has shown efficacy in vitro in modulating STIM1-dependent SOCE, there is a paucity of direct data in animal models of sarcopenia or in clinical contexts specifically addressing aged skeletal muscle (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Conte et al., 2024). Second, the complex dual role of SOCE in muscle physiology means that excessive inhibition may impair the physiological Ca²⁺ influx necessary for muscle contraction and repair, potentially exacerbating muscle weakness if not carefully controlled (Kiviluoto et al., 2011; Michelucci et al., 2018). Moreover, off-target effects such as interactions with TRPC channels or interference with other calcium-handling processes have been documented and must be carefully quantified (Shi et al., 2007; Xiong et al., 2017).

Another consideration is the autophagic and lysosomal disruption observed with ML-9 in cardiomyocytes, which raises concerns about potential cytotoxicity in other muscle cell types under stress (Shaikh et al., 2018). This cytotoxic potential necessitates thorough in vivo studies to ensure that any improvement in calcium homeostasis does not come at the expense of muscle cell viability or induce deleterious long-term effects. It will be critical to delineate the dosage window that achieves the desired balance between reducing pathological Ca²⁺ overload and maintaining sufficient SOCE for SR refilling and normal muscle function (Smyth et al., 2008; Terrell et al., 2023).

Overall, ML-9 offers a mechanistically specific approach to target the altered Ca²⁺ dynamics observed in aged muscle. Its ability to inhibit STIM1 oligomerization with defined cellular effects on SOCE is a significant strength, supporting the hypothesis that modulation rather than complete blockade of SOCE may restore proper calcium balance in sarcopenia. Nonetheless, further targeted experimental validation in aged myotubes and animal models of sarcopenia is required to fully evaluate its efficacy and safety profile. Preclinical studies should specifically address the optimal concentration range, off-target profiles, and long-term effects on muscle physiology and regeneration. Only with such data can the therapeutic potential of ML-9 for sarcopenia be conclusively determined, balancing its benefits in preventing cytotoxic Ca²⁺ elevations with the risk of impairing necessary Ca²⁺-dependent repair and contraction processes (Conte et al., 2021a; Brotto et al., 2014).

In conclusion, while ML-9 possesses promising attributes as a repurposed drug candidate for sarcopenia—owing to its established ability to modulate STIM1-dependent SOCE and thus stabilize calcium dynamics—the current literature primarily supports its utility as a research tool rather than a clinically validated therapeutic. Its strengths lie in its mechanistic specificity and extensive experimental characterization, yet its potential weaknesses, including possible off-target toxicity and the delicate balance required to maintain physiological calcium entry in aging muscle, underscore the need for comprehensive preclinical evaluation before advancing to clinical trials.
