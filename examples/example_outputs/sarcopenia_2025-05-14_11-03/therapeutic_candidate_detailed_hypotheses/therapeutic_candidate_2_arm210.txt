Proposal for ARM210 (S48168)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
ARM210, also known as S48168, is a small‐molecule compound of the benzothiazepine chemical class that functions as a Rycal. Rycals have been strategically developed to target ryanodine receptor (RyR) dysfunction by reconstituting the stabilizing interaction between FKBP12 (calstabin1) and RyR1. ARM210 was synthesized as a derivative within the benzothiazepine family, a group of compounds known for their ability to modulate calcium channel behavior by specifically binding to the oxidation‐sensitive domains of RyR1 and thereby restoring the FKBP12–RyR1 interaction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). These compounds have garnered attention due to their ability to stabilize the closed state of RyR channels, reducing pathological sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium (Ca²⁺) leak—a mechanism that underlies muscle weakness in various myopathies. ARM210, as a next‐generation Rycal, has shown in preclinical studies to exhibit oral bioavailability, effective muscle penetration, and favorable pharmacokinetics in rodent models, making it a promising candidate for repurposing for age‐related muscle weakness or sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Armgo Pharma, Inc., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, compounds belonging to the Rycal class have been investigated primarily in the context of cardiac and skeletal muscle disorders. Early preclinical studies focused on using Rycal compounds such as S107 in animal models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and other RYR1‐related myopathies. For example, studies in mdx mice—a well‐established model of DMD—demonstrated that Rycal stabilization of RyR1 improved muscle strength, reduced pathological calcium leak, and enhanced excitation–contraction coupling (Capogrosso et al., 2017, pp. 14–16; Forrester, 2018, pp. 74–84). More recently, ARM210 has been evaluated in clinical studies targeting RYR1‐related myopathies (RYR1‐RM), as exemplified by the phase I trial NCT04141670 in patients with genetically confirmed RYR1 mutations. Although the primary focus of these trials has been on inherited myopathies, the underlying mechanism involving pathological calcium leak due to RyR1 oxidation is also central to the pathogenesis of sarcopenia (Armgo Pharma, Inc., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The therapeutic history of benzothiazepine Rycals extends from cardiac pathologies to muscle diseases; the specificity of ARM210 for RyR1 without significantly affecting RyR2 offers a targeted approach distinct from non‐specific calcium channel blockers. Furthermore, preclinical studies in aged rodents have shown that RyR1‐stabilizing compounds improve evoked Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and fatigue resistance, suggesting that the benefits observed in DMD and other myopathies might be translatable to age‐related muscle weakness conditions such as sarcopenia (Marks, 2023, pp. 6–7; Umanskaya, 2015, pp. 33–37).

Mechanism of Action:
The fundamental mechanism of ARM210 action is based on the molecular pathology of RyR1 dysfunction in muscle aging. In healthy skeletal muscle, the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) is essential for rapid Ca²⁺ release from the SR during excitation–contraction coupling. Under normal conditions, the stabilizing protein FKBP12 (also known as calstabin1) binds to RyR1 to maintain the channel in a tightly closed state during diastole, thus preventing spontaneous Ca²⁺ leak (Andersson et al., 2011, pp. 1–2; Umanskaya, 2015, pp. 28–33). With aging, oxidative stress increases, leading to modifications such as oxidation and nitrosylation of RyR1. These post‐translational modifications disrupt the conformational integrity of the channel, weakening the binding affinity of FKBP12 for RyR1, and result in a “leaky” channel phenotype where pathological Ca²⁺ leak occurs during rest (Andersson et al., 2011, pp. 7–9; Forrester, 2018, pp. 63–68).
ARM210 exerts its therapeutic effect by binding directly to an oxidation-sensitive domain of RyR1. This binding enhances the re-association of FKBP12 to the receptor complex, thus re-stabilizing the closed state of the channel and significantly reducing SR Ca²⁺ leak (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Mitronova et al., 2023, pp. 2–4). As a result, the preservation of proper SR Ca²⁺ storage ensures that during muscle activation, the evoked Ca²⁺ transient amplitude is maintained or improved, which is critical for effective muscle contraction and fatigue resistance (Andersson & Marks, 2010, pp. 4–5; Umanskaya, 2015, pp. 33–37). From a biochemical perspective, this targeted stabilization does not rely on altering the post‐translational modification state of RyR1 itself but rather on securing the interaction between the receptor and its regulatory protein, thereby circumventing the consequences of oxidative modifications that are partially irreversible due to slow receptor turnover (Andersson et al., 2011, pp. 2–3; Umanskaya, 2015, pp. 33–37). This approach is unique because it offers specificity: ARM210 is designed to affect only RyR1 (predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle) without interfering with the function of RyR2 in the heart, an important consideration given the potential for off‐target effects (Marks, 2023, pp. 6–7; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Expected Effect:
Based on the mechanistic rationale, in preclinical assays using aged myotubes, ARM210 is expected to reduce the pathological SR Ca²⁺ leak that arises from RyR1 oxidation-induced dissociation of FKBP12. The reconstitution of the FKBP12–RyR1 interaction should restore proper Ca²⁺ handling by leading to an increase in evoked Ca²⁺ transient amplitude during muscle contraction. This improvement in Ca²⁺ signaling is predicted to enhance muscle contractility and endurance by mitigating the chronic Ca²⁺ leak that contributes to fatigue (Forrester, 2018, pp. 74–84; Umanskaya, 2015, pp. 33–37). In animal models, such as aged rodents, administration of ARM210 has been associated with improved muscle strength and reduced fatigue during exercise, indicating that similar benefits might be extrapolated to clinical cases of sarcopenia (Marks, 2023, pp. 6–7; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Since RyR1 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, particularly in myotubes and mature muscle fibers, the targeted action of ARM210 is expected to be robust in the cells relevant to sarcopenia. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic properties of ARM210, including its oral bioavailability and demonstrated muscle penetration in rodent studies, support its expected efficacy in enhancing muscle function in humans by ensuring adequate drug levels at the target tissue (Marks, 2023, pp. 1–2). The observed effect is not simply due to a general inhibition of calcium channels but is mediated by a highly specific restoration of the normal coupling machinery of RyR1, which under pathological conditions leads to chronic calcium leak, a primary contributor to muscle weakness and atrophy seen in sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Andersson et al., 2011, pp. 7–9).

Overall Evaluation:
ARM210 offers significant promise as a therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia by directly targeting a mechanistic root cause of age-related muscle weakness—pathological SR Ca²⁺ leak due to RyR1 oxidation and FKBP12 dissociation. The strengths of ARM210 lie in its highly specific mechanism of action, which offers a targeted therapeutic approach compared to non-specific calcium channel blockers. In preclinical studies, ARM210 has demonstrated both efficacy and favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including oral bioavailability and effective tissue penetration, particularly in skeletal muscle (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Armgo Pharma, Inc., 2020; Mitronova et al., 2023, pp. 2–4). The fact that ARM210 specifically stabilizes RyR1 without significant effect on RyR2 minimizes the risk of adverse cardiac effects, which is a critical consideration in an aging population often burdened with comorbid cardiovascular conditions (Marks, 2023, pp. 6–7; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, the translational promise of ARM210 is bolstered by its progression into preclinical large-animal studies and early-phase clinical trials in the context of RYR1-related myopathies, suggesting a pathway for future evaluation in sarcopenia (Armgo Pharma, Inc., 2020; O’Connor et al., 2023, pp. 11–13).

Nonetheless, there are also challenges and potential weaknesses that need to be considered. While the mechanism is well-supported by preclinical evidence, direct clinical data specifically in sarcopenia patients are still lacking. Most of the existing studies have focused on RYR1-related myopathies or dystrophic models, and though the mechanism is similar, sarcopenia may have additional underlying multifactorial influences such as hormonal changes, inflammatory mediators, and neuromuscular junction degeneration that might not be fully addressed by RyR1 stabilization alone (Agrawal, Suryakumar, & Rathor, 2018, pp. 10–11; Umanskaya, 2015, pp. 33–37). Another potential concern is the irreversible nature of some oxidative modifications and mitochondrial dysfunction seen in aged muscle; while ARM210 can stabilize RyR1 despite these changes, the long-term impact on muscle regeneration and function in severely aged tissues remains to be fully determined (Andersson et al., 2011, pp. 7–9; Forrester, 2018, pp. 74–84). However, given that RyR1 dysregulation is a central event in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia, the targeted intervention by ARM210 might still produce meaningful improvements even if other factors contribute to muscle decline.

Overall, ARM210 is a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of sarcopenia. Its targeted mechanism—stabilizing RyR1 via restoration of FKBP12 binding and reduction of pathological Ca²⁺ leak—directly addresses a critical molecular defect observed in aged skeletal muscle (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Marks, 2023, pp. 1–2; Umanskaya, 2015, pp. 28–33). The comprehensive preclinical evidence, combined with promising pharmacokinetic data and early clinical advancement in related RYR1 myopathies, supports further investigation of ARM210 in the context of age-related muscle weakness and sarcopenia. Future studies should aim to expand the clinical evaluation of ARM210 specifically in sarcopenic populations while also considering combination strategies that address additional contributing factors to sarcopenia such as systemic inflammation and neuromuscular degeneration. In conclusion, the strengths of ARM210—in terms of its specific molecular targeting, favorable pharmacological profile, and translational promise—make it a compelling candidate for further development against sarcopenia, although careful clinical validation in the appropriate populations is warranted (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Armgo Pharma, Inc., 2020; Marks, 2023, pp. 6–7).
