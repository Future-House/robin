Proposal for 78-c (CD38 inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
The compound 78-c, chemically designated as N-(4-(4-bromophenyl)thiazol-2-yl)acetamide, is a small‐molecule inhibitor designed to target the NADase activity of the enzyme CD38. This molecule belongs to the thiazolylacetamide class, which has been developed following a series of structure‐based medicinal chemistry efforts focused on blocking CD38’s enzymatic function. Its chemical structure is characterized by a thiazole ring linked to an acetamide moiety, further substituted with a bromophenyl group, which contributes to its high potency and selectivity for CD38. The synthesis of 78-c arises from multi‐step organic routes that include the formation of the thiazole core and subsequent functional group modifications to optimize its binding affinity for CD38’s catalytic pocket. Historically, compounds within this chemical class have been explored in various preclinical studies for their ability to modulate NAD+ metabolism, a pathway that is central to many aspects of cellular energy balance and aging. The small‐molecule nature of 78-c offers advantages in terms of oral bioavailability, tissue distribution, and the potential for fine‐tuning pharmacokinetic properties. This feature contrasts with biologics such as monoclonal antibodies, which, despite their success in oncology (for example, the targeting of CD38 in multiple myeloma with daratumumab), present challenges when considered for chronic indications like age‐related muscle degeneration (Tarragó et al., 2018; Chini et al., 2018; Zuo et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Over the past decade, the modulation of NAD+ metabolism has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy in addressing a variety of age‐related diseases, including metabolic syndrome, cardiac dysfunction, and, more recently, skeletal muscle dysfunction embodied by sarcopenia. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that increased CD38 activity is one key driver of age‐related NAD+ decline, and, accordingly, CD38 inhibition can restore NAD+ availability in various tissues. Notably, the small molecule 78-c has been characterized in rodent models and shown to effectively inhibit the NADase activity of CD38 with low nanomolar potency, leading to increased tissue NAD+ levels in liver, muscle, and cardiac tissues. In aged mice, treatment with 78-c has been associated with improvements in glucose tolerance, exercise capacity, and even cardiac performance; these improvements are linked to enhanced NAD+ pools and downstream activation of NAD+‐dependent enzymes such as SIRT1 (Tarragó et al., 2018). Despite these promising biochemical and physiological findings in rodent models, the literature search for clinical trials specifically targeting sarcopenia with CD38 inhibitors, including 78-c, has yielded no registered clinical studies (ClinicalTrials.gov). To date, while CD38 inhibitors have been explored in the context of metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular aging, their direct application for muscle wasting syndromes like sarcopenia remains in the preclinical stage. The use of small‐molecule CD38 inhibitors is also supported by other investigational studies that have demonstrated improved NAD+ bioavailability and associated renoprotection and cardioprotection, suggesting that repurposing these compounds for the treatment of sarcopenia is an attractive proposition given the shared underlying mechanism of age‐related NAD+ decline (Tarragó et al., 2018; Chini et al., 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
CD38 is a multifunctional ectoenzyme that primarily acts as an NAD+ hydrolase, degrading NAD+ into ADP‐ribose (ADPR) and nicotinamide (NAM), and also catalyzes the production of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a potent secondary messenger involved in calcium signaling. In aging tissues, CD38 expression and enzymatic activity are upregulated, leading to a marked decline in intracellular NAD+ levels. This reduction in NAD+ is critical because NAD+ serves as an essential cofactor for sirtuins, particularly SIRT1, a deacetylase involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, regulation of inflammation, and modulation of cellular stress responses. In skeletal muscle, SIRT1 activation is linked to improved mitochondrial function and can influence the acetylation status of key regulatory proteins, including SERCA2 (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2). SERCA2 plays a central role in calcium reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and thus in ensuring proper Ca2+ transient amplitude and muscle contractility. The mechanism of action of 78-c is predicated on its ability to bind reversibly, and with high affinity, to the catalytic site of CD38, thereby competitively inhibiting its NADase function. Detailed biochemical studies have shown that 78-c exhibits an uncompetitive inhibition mechanism with very low inhibitory concentration (IC50 values in the nanomolar range), which translates into the stabilization of intracellular NAD+ levels. Elevated NAD+ in turn enhances the activity of SIRT1, which is not directly inhibited by 78-c. Active SIRT1 promotes deacetylation of its downstream substrates, one of which is SERCA2. Deacetylation of SERCA2 is hypothesized to restore its function, improving the efficiency of Ca2+ reuptake into the SR and normalizing Ca2+ transients in aged myotubes. This multi‐layered biochemical cascade—from CD38 inhibition to NAD+ restoration, activation of SIRT1 and consequent modulation of SERCA2 activity—provides a coherent mechanistic rationale for the use of 78-c in treating sarcopenia (Chini et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Kitada et al., 2023; Foreman et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the anticipated effect of 78-c in an in vitro assay using aged human myotubes is the preservation or elevation of intracellular NAD+ levels. This outcome should be measured using NAD+ quantification assays, such as cycling assays or HPLC-mass spectroscopy, which have previously evidenced increased NAD+ levels in rodent tissues following treatment with 78-c. With higher NAD+ availability, SIRT1 activity is expected to be restored or enhanced. This activation should lead to the deacetylation of several SIRT1 substrates, including SERCA2. In muscle cells, proper SERCA2 function is indispensable for maintaining efficient SR Ca2+ reuptake. Consequently, one would anticipate that 78-c treatment will improve the kinetics of Ca2+ transients in aged myotubes, measurable via calcium imaging techniques such as fluorescent calcium indicators or electrophysiological recordings. The normalization of SR Ca2+ handling is critical because impaired Ca2+ reuptake is directly correlated with reduced muscle contractility and fatigue, hallmarks of sarcopenia. In this context, the compound is acting not only by preventing NAD+ depletion but also indirectly by ensuring that key regulators of muscle contraction, such as SERCA2, operate at optimal levels. The target protein SIRT1 is well-documented to be expressed in skeletal muscle and plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and metabolic function (Goody & Henry, 2018). By linking the restoration of NAD+ to improved Ca2+ handling via SIRT1-mediated regulation of SERCA2, 78-c is expected to mitigate the muscle weakness and atrophy characteristic of sarcopenia (Tarragó et al., 2018; Goody & Henry, 2018).

Overall Evaluation:
In our evaluation of 78-c as a therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia, several strengths and some potential weaknesses emerge from the literature. On the strength side, 78-c is a well-characterized small molecule that has demonstrated potent and specific inhibition of CD38's NADase activity. Its ability to elevate tissue NAD+ levels has been robustly documented in several preclinical rodent studies (Tarragó et al., 2018). The strategy of preserving NAD+ by blocking its depletion is fundamentally attractive because NAD+ is a central metabolic cofactor with widespread influence over mitochondrial function, redox balance, and cell signaling. By targeting CD38, 78-c indirectly supports SIRT1, a critical regulator of muscle metabolism and protein homeostasis. SIRT1 activation has been associated with improved mitochondrial biogenesis and enhanced muscle performance, making it a logical downstream target in studies of muscle aging. Additionally, improvements in Ca2+ handling via the modulation of SERCA2 deacetylation provide a direct mechanistic link between NAD+ restoration and enhanced muscle contractility; SERCA2 is well recognized as a determining factor in maintaining Ca2+ transients and proper muscle relaxation, phenomena that are impaired in sarcopenia (Chini et al., 2018; Kitada et al., 2023).

On the other hand, there are notable gaps and potential challenges. Despite promising preclinical data, there are no current clinical trials or direct clinical data demonstrating the efficacy of 78-c in treating sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov). Although the compound has been tested in rodent models and has exhibited favorable pharmacokinetics, its specific application in human skeletal muscle cells, particularly aged myotubes, remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, while the mechanism linking CD38 inhibition to improved NAD+ bioavailability and subsequent SIRT1 activation is compelling, the precise molecular determinants governing the deacetylation and functional modulation of SERCA2 remain less explicitly characterized in the literature. There is also the possibility of off-target effects; while 78-c appears highly selective for CD38 over related enzymes such as PARP1 and NAMPT, comprehensive toxicity profiles in longer-term studies or in other relevant tissues have not been fully established (Chini et al., 2018). Finally, given that muscle aging and sarcopenia are multifactorial disorders influenced by a plethora of pathways beyond NAD+ metabolism and Ca2+ handling – such as inflammatory cytokine signaling, oxidative stress, and satellite cell dysfunction – the therapeutic effectiveness of 78-c may ultimately require combination with other interventions or a multi-targeted approach.

Overall, 78-c appears to be a promising candidate from a mechanistic and biochemical standpoint. Its ability to gradually restore intracellular NAD+ levels by inhibiting CD38, thereby sustaining SIRT1 activity and promoting proper SERCA2 function, builds a strong scientific rationale for its potential use in reversing or mitigating sarcopenia-related muscle dysfunction. Given the robust preclinical evidence for improvements in NAD+ metabolism and muscle function in aged rodent models (Tarragó et al., 2018; Foreman et al., 2021), the translational prospects of 78-c merit further exploration. However, it is imperative to proceed with comprehensive studies in relevant muscle models, both in vitro and in vivo, to establish clear proof of concept in the context of sarcopenia, to assess safety in long-term administration, and to further characterize its efficacy in restoring muscle function and structure (Chini et al., 2018; Kitada et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov).

In summary, our comprehensive literature review indicates that 78-c is a highly promising therapeutic candidate for targeting sarcopenia through its novel mechanism of inhibiting CD38 to elevate NAD+ levels. This elevation is postulated to enhance SIRT1 activity, promote the deacetylation and optimal function of SERCA2, and thereby improve SR Ca2+ reuptake and Ca2+ transients in aged muscles. The preclinical data supporting this mechanism, along with the compound’s favorable pharmacokinetic profile and tractability as a small molecule drug, make it a strong candidate for further development. Nonetheless, the absence of clinical data and direct studies in sarcopenia-specific models underscore the need for additional research to validate these mechanisms in human muscle tissues and to assess potential off-target effects. Ultimately, 78-c represents a scientifically grounded, mechanistically innovative approach to combating sarcopenia, and its development should be pursued with rigorous preclinical and eventual clinical investigations (Tarragó et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov; Goody & Henry, 2018).
