Proposal for Rosiglitazone

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Rosiglitazone is a fully synthetic small molecule that belongs to the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of drugs and acts as an agonist for the peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). This molecular entity was developed through a systematic program of medicinal chemistry that sought to improve insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The design and synthesis of rosiglitazone involved iterative chemical modifications of the TZD scaffold to yield a compound with high receptor affinity, favorable pharmacokinetics, and robust tissue distribution profiles. Its chemical synthesis was rooted in the exploitation of structure–activity relationships that allowed researchers to identify key functional groups needed for optimal receptor engagement, leading to the activation of PPARγ and thereby modulating the transcription of genes implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism (Cheng et al., 2019). As a member of the TZD class, rosiglitazone is part of a drug family historically intended for metabolic reprogramming; these agents have been utilized since the 1990s to improve glycemic control by enhancing insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, liver, and to some extent in skeletal muscle. Today, the class is well known not only for its antidiabetic properties but also for its pleiotropic effects on inflammatory markers and lipid profiles. Researchers are increasingly interested in repurposing such agents to target conditions like sarcopenia, where metabolic dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, and oxidative stress converge to impair skeletal muscle function (Cheng et al., 2019; Gross & Staels, 2007).

Therapeutic History
Clinically, rosiglitazone has been extensively used as an antidiabetic agent, with a long history of trials in patients with T2DM and metabolic syndrome. Its primary clinical indication has been to ameliorate insulin resistance, lower fasting blood glucose, and improve overall glycemic control. Over the past two decades, multiple large-scale clinical studies and randomized controlled trials have validated its efficacy in controlling hyperglycemia and modifying detrimental adipocytokine secretion patterns, including elevated levels of adiponectin that contribute to enhanced insulin sensitivity (Cheng et al., 2019; Wu & Tien, 2020). In addition to its success in metabolic endpoints, rosiglitazone has been carefully evaluated in secondary clinical applications, including cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic populations and exploratory studies in inflammatory conditions and even neurodegenerative diseases (Cheng et al., 2019). Despite these robust data, its use in indications related to muscle wasting disorders or sarcopenia has been limited. Searches conducted on ClinicalTrials.gov for “Rosiglitazone AND (sarcopenia OR muscle wasting OR skeletal muscle)” indicate only a handful of studies that inspect muscle function as secondary metabolic outcomes, rather than targeting primary measures of muscle mass or performance (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical investigations have sometimes included endpoints such as mitochondrial function and oxidative stress markers in skeletal muscle tissue; however, the specific use of rosiglitazone in preventing or reversing muscle wasting remains an unproven application. Particularly, while some small-scale studies have noted modifications in muscle metabolite profiles and indirect benefits when combined with interventions like resistance training, the overall clinical evidence for its use in sarcopenia is scarce and often inconclusive (Cetrone et al., 2014; Ma & Chen, 2021). Nevertheless, the established pharmacokinetic profile, widespread clinical experience in diabetes, and known capacity to modulate metabolic transcriptional programs represent compelling reasons to consider rosiglitazone for new therapeutic indications such as sarcopenia (Cheng et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action
At its core, rosiglitazone operates by binding to and activating PPARγ, a nuclear hormone receptor that functions as a transcription factor. Once rosiglitazone occupies the ligand-binding pocket of PPARγ, the receptor undergoes a conformational change that facilitates heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). This heterodimer then binds to specific peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. The ensuing alteration in gene transcription leads to changes in the expression of numerous proteins that regulate fatty acid uptake, adipogenesis, and glucose metabolism (Cheng et al., 2019; Gross & Staels, 2007).

Molecularly, the activation of PPARγ by rosiglitazone results in upregulation of insulin-sensitizing proteins such as adiponectin. In adipose tissue, this results in a more favorable metabolic profile, but in skeletal muscle, the transcriptional effects extend to the promotion of genes that are critical for mitochondrial biogenesis. One important aspect of this is the stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. Activation of AMPK, a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, can upregulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). PGC-1α is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis that promotes the transcription of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production (Coletta et al., 2009). In studies involving PPARγ agonists, increased mitochondrial biogenesis is associated with enhanced ATP generation and reduced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in skeletal muscle cells. This effect is particularly useful in the context of aging muscle, where mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress are key contributors to the development of sarcopenia.

Moreover, rosiglitazone has been shown to affect the differentiation potential of muscle satellite cells, the progenitor cells responsible for regenerative responses in skeletal muscle. In vitro investigations have demonstrated that rosiglitazone can modify the adipogenic differentiation of these satellite cells. Specifically, while satellite cells possess the potential to differentiate not only into myocytes but also into adipocytes, treatment with rosiglitazone has been shown to favor a balance that potentially reduces the ectopic intramuscular fat deposition commonly observed in aged, sarcopenic muscle tissue (De Coppi et al., 2006). By reducing the propensity for adipogenic conversion, rosiglitazone may help maintain the regenerative capacity and contractile function of skeletal muscle fibers.

In addition to its well-characterized transcriptional activities, rosiglitazone’s effects on skeletal muscle may also be attributed to its indirect actions on cellular oxidative stress. ROS overproduction in mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to oxidative post-translational modifications (PTMs) of key proteins such as the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) and the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase (SERCA). Such modifications impair the proteins’ functions and disrupt the delicate balance of Ca²⁺ handling critical for muscle contraction and relaxation. Therefore, by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and boosting the cellular antioxidant defenses (in part through the upregulation of genes involved in fat oxidation and ROS mitigation), rosiglitazone is hypothesized to help prevent these deleterious modifications (Ma & Chen, 2021; Witham et al., 2023). This preservation of the integrity of Ca²⁺ handling proteins, combined with improved energy metabolism, is central to the proposed mechanism for rescuing impaired muscle contraction in the ageing population.

It is also noteworthy that rosiglitazone may exert anti-inflammatory effects by dampening the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which are implicated in muscle catabolism. Chronic low-grade inflammation or “inflammaging” is a central feature of sarcopenia, and by mitigating this inflammatory milieu, rosiglitazone could further support muscle integrity and function (Cetrone et al., 2014; Wu & Tien, 2020). Thus, the comprehensive mechanism of action of rosiglitazone involves a multifaceted interplay between transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes, enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis through AMPK–PGC-1α signaling, modulation of satellite cell differentiation, reduction of ROS, and a dampening of chronic inflammatory processes.

Expected Effect
The core hypothesis for repurposing rosiglitazone in the treatment of sarcopenia is predicated on the expectation that activation of PPARγ will lead to metabolic reprogramming that benefits aged skeletal muscle. In preclinical models of aged myotubes, treatment with rosiglitazone is anticipated to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby increasing the oxidative capacity of the muscle cells. An increase in mitochondrial content is expected to lead to higher ATP levels and a concomitant reduction in the generation of ROS due to a more efficient electron transport chain function and improved coupling efficiency (Ma & Chen, 2021; Witham et al., 2023).

This improved mitochondrial function is hypothesized to lower the oxidative stress burden within muscle cells. A reduction in ROS levels, in turn, should decrease the incidence of oxidative PTMs on Ca²⁺ handling proteins, specifically RyR1 and SERCA. These proteins are critical for the proper excitation–contraction coupling of muscle fibers: RyR1 functions as a major Ca²⁺ release channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, while SERCA is responsible for Ca²⁺ reuptake and muscle relaxation. Oxidative modification of these proteins can lead to aberrant Ca²⁺ transients characterized by reduced amplitude and dysregulated kinetics, ultimately contributing to muscle weakness and impaired contractility. Therefore, by preserving the redox status and structural integrity of RyR1 and SERCA, rosiglitazone is expected to restore more youthful Ca²⁺ transient profiles in aged myotubes (Wu & Tien, 2020; Witham et al., 2023).

Beyond its direct effects on mitochondria and Ca²⁺ handling, rosiglitazone is also anticipated to have a favorable impact on muscle tissue composition through its action on satellite cells. Satellite cells are essential for muscle regeneration and repair. In vitro studies suggest that rosiglitazone can alter the differentiation trajectory of these cells by reducing their adipogenic potential, which may help limit the intramuscular fat infiltration (also known as myosteatosis) that is often observed in elderly individuals with sarcopenia (De Coppi et al., 2006). In this way, rosiglitazone could contribute to a muscle environment that favors myogenesis over adipogenesis, supporting the overall regenerative capacity and contractile function of the tissue.

Furthermore, the anticipated metabolic improvements extend to enhanced insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. Improved glucose uptake, mediated by increased expression and translocation of GLUT4 transporters in muscle fibers, would facilitate better energy utilization, which is critical for the repair and maintenance of muscle tissue. Insulin resistance is closely associated with aging and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia; thus, ameliorating insulin resistance may further support muscle health and function (Zhang et al., 2021; Ma & Chen, 2021).

Collectively, the expected effect of rosiglitazone in an in vitro model of aged myotubes is multifold:
1. Enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis leading to improved ATP production and reduced ROS production.
2. Reduction of oxidative stress that prevents deleterious modifications on key Ca²⁺ handling proteins (RyR1 and SERCA), thereby restoring normal Ca²⁺ transient kinetics and amplitude essential for muscle contraction.
3. Modulation of muscle satellite cell differentiation to reduce intramuscular fat deposition and promote effective myogenesis.
4. Improved insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, leading to better glucose uptake and overall metabolic function.
These effects are expected to culminate in the restoration of muscle function and contractile strength, offering a potential therapeutic avenue for mitigating the impacts of sarcopenia (Witham et al., 2023; Ma & Chen, 2021; Wu & Tien, 2020).

Overall Evaluation
Rosiglitazone presents an intriguing and multifaceted candidate for repurposing as a treatment for sarcopenia. The extensive clinical use of rosiglitazone in T2DM has endowed the drug with a well-characterized safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profile. This robust clinical history supports the feasibility of repurposing efforts, particularly in a population where metabolic derangements often coexist with muscle wasting. The drug’s proven capacity to activate PPARγ and subsequently modulate gene transcription that enhances insulin sensitivity and promotes favorable lipid metabolism offers a solid rationale for its application in skeletal muscle disorders (Cheng et al., 2019; Gross & Staels, 2007).

One of the strongest aspects of rosiglitazone’s potential in sarcopenia is its documented ability to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis through mechanisms that involve AMPK and PGC-1α signaling. Given that mitochondrial dysfunction is a central feature of aging skeletal muscle, the ability to boost mitochondrial function could translate into significant metabolic improvements in muscle fibers. In addition, reducing ROS production through enhanced mitochondrial efficiency may play a critical role in preventing oxidative damage to Ca²⁺ handling proteins, a pathophysiological process implicated in age-related declines in muscle contractility (Coletta et al., 2009; Ma & Chen, 2021).

Furthermore, preclinical studies have provided evidence that rosiglitazone can modulate the differentiation potential of muscle satellite cells, potentially limiting the ectopic fat deposition that is frequently associated with aging muscle and contributes to functional decline. Such modulation would not only preserve muscle fiber integrity but also support regenerative processes critical for maintaining muscle mass in the elderly (De Coppi et al., 2006).

Nonetheless, significant weaknesses and challenges complicate the potential repurposing of rosiglitazone for sarcopenia. In contrast to its well-established metabolic effects, there is a notable scarcity of robust clinical data demonstrating direct improvements in muscle mass, strength, or functional performance in patients with sarcopenia. Most of the available studies have focused on metabolic endpoints rather than primary outcomes related to skeletal muscle performance (Cheng et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This gap in the literature means that the proposed mechanism—particularly the prevention of oxidative modifications on RyR1 and SERCA leading to normalized Ca²⁺ handling—remains largely theoretical and requires extensive validation in both preclinical and clinical settings.

Moreover, the safety profile of rosiglitazone, while well documented in diabetic populations, raises concerns for its application in the elderly—the primary population affected by sarcopenia. Adverse effects such as weight gain, fluid retention, and an increased risk of heart failure have been repeatedly reported, and these may pose significant risks in older patients who often have additional cardiovascular comorbidities (Gross & Staels, 2007; Cheng et al., 2019). Balancing the potential metabolic and mitochondrial benefits against the risk of such side effects is a major consideration when contemplating the use of rosiglitazone in treating sarcopenia.

There is also some inconsistency in the available results from studies examining thiazolidinediones in muscle-related outcomes. While some investigations have demonstrated improvements in biomarkers of mitochondrial function and reduced intramyocellular lipid deposition, others have not shown significant enhancements in clinical measures of muscle mass or strength. For instance, studies have noted that pioglitazone, a closely related TZD, can lead to improvements in mitochondrial gene expression and oxidative metabolism without necessarily producing a measurable increase in muscle mass or performance, particularly when used as a monotherapy (Witham et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2021). These mixed outcomes highlight the need for well-designed, targeted studies to confirm whether the biochemical and cellular effects of rosiglitazone can translate into meaningful clinical benefits that address the core deficits seen in sarcopenia.

Additionally, the specific hypothesis that rosiglitazone’s activation of PPARγ will ultimately rescue Ca²⁺ handling defects by protecting RyR1 and SERCA from oxidative damage is novel and attractive from a mechanistic standpoint. Yet, the current chain of evidence linking PPARγ activation through rosiglitazone to improvements in Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and kinetics remains indirect. Direct demonstration of improved excitation–contraction coupling in aged muscle fibers following rosiglitazone treatment has yet to be rigorously established in either preclinical models or human studies (Wu & Tien, 2020; Ma & Chen, 2021).

In summary, rosiglitazone stands as an attractive candidate for repurposing in the treatment of sarcopenia due to its well-documented metabolic actions, capacity to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis, and potential to reduce oxidative stress in muscle cells. Its long clinical history in T2DM provides a wealth of pharmacokinetic and safety data that can serve as a foundation for exploring new applications. Nevertheless, the direct evidence for preventing muscle wasting via improved Ca²⁺ handling remains limited, and safety concerns—particularly in the elderly—must be carefully balanced against the potential benefits. The evidence suggests that while rosiglitazone has a strong mechanistic rationale for use in sarcopenia, further rigorous preclinical studies that specifically evaluate muscle function and direct measurements of mitochondrial and Ca²⁺ handling parameters in aged muscle are needed. Follow-up early-phase clinical trials should incorporate robust muscle-specific endpoints, including measurements of muscle mass, strength, functional performance, and biomarkers of oxidative stress. Only by addressing these gaps can we determine whether rosiglitazone’s metabolic reprogramming, aimed at protecting components like RyR1 and SERCA, can translate into tangible improvements in muscle health in the elderly (Cheng et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2004; Wu & Tien, 2020).
