Proposal for Synthetic DWORF peptide (catalog custom synthesis)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Synthetic DWORF peptide is based on the naturally occurring DWORF micropeptide, a 34–35 amino acid regulator originally discovered within a transcript that was previously annotated as a long noncoding RNA (Nelson et al., 2016). This micropeptide has been identified endogenously in cardiac and slow‐twitch skeletal muscle, where it localizes to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane and acts as a direct activator of the SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase) pump. As a therapeutic candidate, synthetic DWORF is a small peptide product, custom-synthesized in a laboratory setting and belonging to the class of peptide-based therapeutics. Peptide therapeutics have been broadly used to modulate protein–protein interactions by mimicking or inhibiting endogenous regulators; examples include inhibitors of signaling protein interactions and peptide hormones. In this case, the synthetic DWORF peptide seeks to recapitulate the endogenous activity of DWORF by binding to SERCA and displacing its inhibitory partners, phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) (Fisher et al., 2021; Bonilauri & Dallagiovanna, 2022). This candidate has gained attention through genetic validation in animal models via gene therapy approaches, and the advantage of a synthetic peptide modality is that it avoids the potential risks associated with viral vectors, while still leveraging the proven mechanistic benefits of increasing SERCA activity.

Therapeutic History:
The endogenous DWORF peptide has been studied extensively in the context of improving cardiac performance. Preclinical models have demonstrated that DWORF overexpression in the heart via gene therapy enhances SERCA activity, restoring calcium reuptake dynamics and improving contractility in models of dilated cardiomyopathy (Makarewich et al., 2018; Morales et al., 2023). Biochemical studies have shown that DWORF increases the maximal activity (Vmax) of SERCA by nearly 1.7-fold without altering its calcium affinity (Fisher et al., 2021). Although most of the direct therapeutic application evidence comes from cardiac models, the mechanistic underpinnings are highly relevant to skeletal muscle function as well. In skeletal muscle, impaired SERCA function is a key contributor to conditions such as sarcopenia, an age-related loss of muscle mass and function that has been linked to disrupted calcium homeostasis (Li et al., 2025). To date, there is no documented clinical use of synthetic DWORF peptide in sarcopenia; however, the repurposing concept is built upon a strong biochemical foundation. Prior research involving SERCA modulation via genetic manipulation of its endogenous regulators (PLN, SLN, and DWORF) has shown that relieving inhibition or directly activating SERCA can improve calcium cycling and muscle function (Nelson et al., 2016; Cleary et al., 2022). Thus, the historical use in cardiac muscle models, combined with analogous mechanisms in skeletal muscle, supports the rationale for exploring synthetic DWORF peptide in sarcopenia.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, DWORF directly interacts with SERCA by binding within its inhibitory groove and displacing endogenous inhibitors such as phospholamban and sarcolipin. Detailed biochemical studies using reconstituted membrane assays have demonstrated that DWORF increases the maximal catalytic activity (Vmax) of SERCA by approximately 1.7-fold while leaving the calcium affinity (KCa) unchanged (Fisher et al., 2021). This effect contrasts dramatically with that of inhibitory regulators such as PLN, which lower calcium affinity when bound to SERCA (Cleary et al., 2022; Fisher et al., 2021). Furthermore, structural and molecular dynamics simulations have revealed that DWORF possesses a unique structure—a helix-linker-helix conformation with a proline-induced kink in its transmembrane domain—that prevents it from exerting inhibitory contacts with SERCA. Instead, DWORF stabilizes conformations of SERCA that are associated with elevated calcium (Fisher et al., 2021; Rathod et al., 2021). This selective binding is calcium-dependent, such that DWORF preferentially interacts with SERCA when cytosolic calcium is high, which is during the contraction phase, thereby facilitating rapid calcium reuptake during relaxation. By displacing inhibitory peptides (PLN and SLN), which normally act to decrease SERCA efficiency, DWORF effectively reestablishes rapid calcium transient clearance. The detailed interactions include specific contacts with transmembrane segments of SERCA and depend on key residues within DWORF; for example, the proline residue at position 15 is critical for its function, as its mutation abolishes the effect (Fisher et al., 2021; Nelson et al., 2016). Thus, the biochemical mechanism is robust, targeting the regulatory interfaces of SERCA and enhancing its activity in a manner that is both direct and efficient.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for using synthetic DWORF peptide in aged myotubes and, by extension, in patients with sarcopenia, is that exogenous administration of the peptide will replicate the effects observed via gene therapy or endogenous overexpression. In the proposed assays, synthetic DWORF peptide is expected to bind SERCA in the membranes of aged skeletal muscle fibers, displacing inhibitory regulators such as PLN and SLN. This displacement should lead to enhanced SERCA-mediated calcium uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, reduced cytosolic calcium overload, and restoration of rapid calcium transient clearance—key factors that are typically compromised in sarcopenia (Li et al., 2025; Bonilauri & Dallagiovanna, 2022). Improved calcium dynamics will likely translate into better muscle contractility, reduced fatigue, and potentially a delay or reversal of muscle atrophy associated with aging. This mechanism is particularly promising because it directly addresses the underlying calcium dysregulation that has been observed in aged muscle fibers. The expected biochemical effect is based on robust cellular assays, such as those performed in HEK293 cardiomimetic cell systems, where overexpression of DWORF resulted in increased endoplasmic reticulum calcium load and uptake rates (Fisher et al., 2021). Given that SERCA isoforms (e.g., SERCA1 in skeletal muscle and SERCA2a in cardiac muscle) are expressed in relevant tissues, delivering synthetic DWORF peptide should, in theory, enhance calcium cycling in these cells. This strategy also benefits from not requiring long-term genetic manipulations, as the peptide itself would function as a biological modulator upon administration.

Overall Evaluation:
The synthetic DWORF peptide candidate shows strong promise as a therapeutic approach for sarcopenia for several reasons. First, its mechanism of action is highly specific and well validated at the molecular level—by targeting the regulatory interaction between SERCA and its endogenous inhibitors, DWORF directly enhances calcium handling, which is fundamental to muscle contractility (Fisher et al., 2021; Nelson et al., 2016). Second, the biological rationale is supported by extensive biochemical and cellular evidence in cardiac models, and the fundamental aspects of SERCA regulation appear conserved in skeletal muscle (Bonilauri & Dallagiovanna, 2022; Li et al., 2025). Third, using a synthetic peptide avoids complications associated with gene therapy vectors (e.g., viral vector risks) and can be precisely dosed, potentially leading to a better safety profile. However, there are also weaknesses to consider. Although preclinical cardiac studies have provided robust data, direct evidence in aged skeletal muscle or sarcopenia models is currently limited; thus, further research will be needed to establish efficacy in this context (Ochoa et al., 2023). Additionally, the delivery method, bioavailability, and stability of the synthetic peptide in vivo remain significant challenges that have not yet been fully addressed in the literature. There is also the potential risk that excessive activation of SERCA could disturb calcium homeostasis further by promoting calcium overload in the sarcoplasmic reticulum if not tightly controlled (Fisher et al., 2021; Cleary et al., 2022). Overall, however, the mechanistic specificity, the robust molecular data supporting increased SERCA activity, and the potential advantages of avoiding gene therapy techniques make synthetic DWORF peptide a compelling candidate for further investigation in the treatment of sarcopenia. Further preclinical studies focusing on aged myotubes and animal models of muscle aging will be critical to assess safety, optimize dosing, and establish efficacy before clinical translation can be considered.
