Proposal for CK-2127107 (Reldesemtiv)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
CK-2127107, also known as Reldesemtiv, is a fully synthetic, small‐molecule fast skeletal troponin activator (FSTA) originally discovered through a drug discovery program aiming to directly target the contractile apparatus of skeletal muscle (Alsulami & Marston, 2020). It belongs to a novel class of compounds that sensitize the fast skeletal troponin complex to calcium, thereby enhancing muscle contractility without altering global calcium homeostasis. Reldesemtiv was designed as a next‐generation agent following earlier compounds such as tirasemtiv. The initial synthesis involved optimizing chemical scaffolds to achieve high potency, selectivity, and improved pharmacokinetic profiles relative to earlier analogues. The chemical structure of this compound is based on modifications of heteroaryl‐containing pyrimidine derivatives that interact selectively with fast skeletal muscle troponin C (Alsulami & Marston, 2020; Andrews et al., 2018). This structural design enables Reldesemtiv to bind selectively to the regulatory complex in fast fibers, thus sparing slow skeletal and cardiac muscle isoforms and reducing the potential for off‐target cardiac effects. In essence, Reldesemtiv is part of a family of muscle activators that have historically been developed for neuromuscular diseases, and its proposed repurposing for sarcopenia leverages its ability to counteract muscle weakness by directly enhancing contractile responsiveness in atrophied or aged muscle fibers (Park, 2018).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of CK-2127107 is anchored in its evaluation for neuromuscular indications. Early pharmacodynamic assessments were conducted in healthy human volunteer studies where Reldesemtiv demonstrated dose‐dependent increases in muscle force production following nerve stimulation (Andrews et al., 2018). Subsequent clinical trials, including Phase 2 studies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017) and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016), provided initial safety and pharmacokinetic data that confirmed oral bioavailability and a favorable tolerability profile (Unknown Reference). Although the majority of clinical development so far has been directed toward neuromuscular disorders such as ALS and SMA—with endpoints measuring respiratory muscle function and global motor performance—the compound has never been directly evaluated in a dedicated trial for sarcopenia. However, the underlying mechanism by which Reldesemtiv enhances muscle contractility makes it an attractive candidate for repurposing to treat age‐related muscle weakness, where the pathology involves diminished contractile output rather than solely reduced muscle mass (Unknown Reference). Its use in these neuromuscular diseases thus provides proof‐of‐concept data regarding the feasibility of targeting the muscle’s contractile machinery, even though the patient populations differ. Preclinical studies in rodent models have similarly demonstrated improved exercise tolerance and enhanced muscle force production with FSTAs, lending further support to their potential translational application in conditions characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness, such as sarcopenia (Cheng et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, CK-2127107 exerts its effects by binding to the fast skeletal muscle troponin complex, with a particular focus on modulating troponin C’s interaction with calcium ions. The compound binds selectively and with high affinity to the fast skeletal isoform of troponin C, thereby stabilizing its calcium‐bound active conformation and effectively slowing the dissociation rate of calcium from the complex (Hwee et al., 2017). This mechanism translates into an increased calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, which enables a given submaximal intracellular calcium concentration to produce a stronger force output. Importantly, this approach bypasses some of the defects associated with impaired excitation–contraction coupling that can occur in sarcopenic muscle, where calcium handling may be suboptimal (Andrews et al., 2018). Reldesemtiv’s binding appears to occur at a site that is unique to fast skeletal muscle troponin—differing from the isoforms present in slow skeletal and cardiac muscle—which further minimizes the risk of off‐target effects that could manifest as adverse cardiac outcomes (Alsulami & Marston, 2020; Cheng et al., 2020). The detailed biochemical interactions involve not only conventional binding forces like hydrogen bonds but may also include pi-alkyl, halogen, and other non-covalent interactions with key residues on troponin C, thus altering the kinetics of calcium binding and release. This increased calcium sensitivity allows the muscle fibers to generate greater contractile force at the typical firing rates of motor neurons seen during everyday activities—particularly in the 5–15 Hz range—making the drug especially useful in conditions where muscles receive suboptimal stimulation (Andrews et al., 2018; Calder et al., 2016).

Expected Effect:
When applied to assays using aged human myotubes or in a clinical setting involving elderly individuals with sarcopenia, the expected effect of CK-2127107 is an enhancement of skeletal muscle contractility resulting in improved submaximal twitch force. In the context of sarcopenia, muscle fibers typically exhibit reduced force production due to a combination of atrophy and impaired excitation–contraction coupling. By increasing the sensitivity of troponin C to calcium, Reldesemtiv is anticipated to partially restore the force-generating capacity of these fibers without necessitating an increase in intracellular calcium levels—which could otherwise provoke deleterious effects such as increased energy expenditure or arrhythmogenicity in non-target tissues (Hwee et al., 2017; Andrews et al., 2018). Furthermore, studies in healthy volunteers have already demonstrated that CK-2127107 produces a dose-dependent increase in muscle force when evaluated by electrical stimulation protocols; this supports the hypothesis that, in sarcopenic muscle, even modest improvements in the contractile apparatus can translate into significant functional gains (Andrews et al., 2018). This mode of action operates independently of pathways that solely target muscle mass, such as anabolic or myostatin-inhibiting therapies, and therefore has the potential to provide a complementary or alternative strategy that directly addresses the decline in muscle quality and contractile performance that characterizes sarcopenia (Cheng et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, CK-2127107 (Reldesemtiv) represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of sarcopenia based on its mechanistic profile, preclinical data, and early-phase clinical safety and pharmacokinetic data. Its strengths include a well-defined molecular mechanism—direct binding to fast skeletal muscle troponin C that enhances calcium sensitivity—which leads to improved force generation while sparing slow skeletal and cardiac muscle. This selectivity is crucial because it minimizes potential off-target effects and ensures that only the muscle fibers most affected in sarcopenia (i.e., fast-twitch fibers) are activated (Alsulami & Marston, 2020; Andrews et al., 2018). Additionally, the compound has undergone thorough Phase I evaluations that have established both its safety and favorable oral pharmacokinetics, thereby providing a sound translational foundation from bench to bedside (Andrews et al., 2018; Unknown Reference).

However, some weaknesses remain. To date, clinical data on Reldesemtiv have been generated primarily in patient populations with neuromuscular diseases such as ALS and in models of COPD; no direct clinical trials have yet been conducted in elderly populations solely suffering from sarcopenia. While the mechanism of action is highly relevant to sarcopenia—where reduced contractility and calcium handling defects are prominent—the efficacy of this FSTA in reversing age-associated muscle weakness remains to be definitively demonstrated (Unknown Reference). Furthermore, the translational leap from improved submaximal force in controlled stimulation experiments to meaningful functional outcomes in older adults is nontrivial; clinical endpoints in sarcopenia would need to include comprehensive assessments of mobility, endurance, and quality of life to establish true benefit (Park, 2018; Correa‐de-Araujo & Bhasin, 2022).

In summary, the cumulative evidence from biochemical assays, preclinical models, and early human studies strongly supports the hypothesis that CK-2127107 can enhance fast skeletal muscle function by modulating troponin C calcium sensitivity. This mechanism is especially appealing in the context of sarcopenia, where conventional therapies aimed at mass gain have had limited success translating into improved muscle performance and physical function. The specificity of CK-2127107 for fast fibers, combined with an established safety record in early clinical studies, positions it as a compelling candidate for further evaluation in sarcopenia. Future studies should aim to verify that the improvements in contractile force observed in preclinical models are replicated in aged human myotubes and elderly subjects, and that these changes ultimately translate into functional benefits such as enhanced mobility and endurance (Andrews et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2020). Addressing these gaps through focused clinical trials in sarcopenic populations would be essential before broadly endorsing CK-2127107 as a treatment for age-related muscle decline. In conclusion, while the preponderance of current evidence is supportive and the mechanistic rationale is sound, the final determination of CK-2127107’s utility for sarcopenia will depend on forthcoming data from studies directly targeting the elderly population afflicted by this condition (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rudnicki et al., 2021; Shefner et al., 2021).
