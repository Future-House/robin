Proposal for Elamipretide (SS-31)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Elamipretide (also known as SS-31) is a synthetic tetrapeptide developed to target mitochondrial dysfunction. It was discovered based on the concept of mitochondrial-targeted therapeutics that selectively accumulate in mitochondria regardless of membrane potential. Chemically, it is composed of alternating aromatic and cationic residues that facilitate its binding to cardiolipin—a phospholipid exclusive to the inner mitochondrial membrane critical for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function. As a member of the Szeto–Schiller peptide family, elamipretide is designed to restore mitochondrial integrity rather than serving merely as a conventional antioxidant. Compounds in this class have previously been utilized in preclinical studies to protect against ischemia-reperfusion injury, attenuate oxidative stress in cardiac tissue, and improve mitochondrial bioenergetics in animal models of mitochondrial diseases (Pepe, 2019; Roshanravan et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Elamipretide has an extensive developmental history in both biochemical and clinical contexts. Biochemically, its ability to bind cardiolipin and modulate mitochondrial function has been demonstrated in multiple preclinical models, where it improved mitochondrial ATP production and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Clinically, elamipretide has been evaluated in Phase II clinical trials for primary mitochondrial myopathies, and its pharmacokinetic profile and muscle uptake are well established, with clear evidence of improved in vivo mitochondrial ATP production following administration in older adults (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2015; Roshanravan et al., 2021). In addition, its clinical evaluation in conditions such as Barth Syndrome and primary mitochondrial diseases in controlled trial settings (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2017; Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2022) supports its use in muscle-related pathologies. Although elamipretide has not been directly tested in sarcopenia clinical trials, the similarities in pathophysiological mechanisms—particularly mitochondrial dysfunction leading to muscle weakness—provide a strong rationale for repurposing it as a therapeutic candidate for age-related muscle decline (Bellanti et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
Elamipretide exerts its therapeutic effects primarily through direct interactions with cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial membrane. This binding stabilizes cardiolipin, thereby preserving the structural integrity of the mitochondrial cristae and promoting the proper assembly and function of the electron transport chain complexes. With improved organization of the electron transport system, mitochondrial ATP synthesis is enhanced while electron leak—a major source of ROS—is minimized (Pepe, 2019; Roshanravan et al., 2021). Additionally, recent studies have suggested that elamipretide improves mitochondrial ADP sensitivity through interactions with the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), resulting in enhanced uptake of ADP and consequent improvement in ATP production in aged muscle tissues (Pharaoh et al., 2023). Beyond its bioenergetic effects, elamipretide’s stabilization of cardiolipin is postulated to preserve mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) and Ca²⁺ exchange sites, which are crucial for maintaining proper mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake and cytosolic Ca²⁺ homeostasis. This preservation of Ca²⁺ exchange platforms may mitigate the excessive cytosolic Ca²⁺ overload seen with aging and thus improve Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and kinetics, ultimately contributing to better fatigue resistance in muscle cells (Roshanravan et al., 2021; Sakellariou et al., 2016). The molecular interactions of elamipretide at the mitochondrial inner membrane are supported by its rapid effect on mitochondrial function observed within hours of administration, indicating that the mechanism is mediated by modulating post-translational processes rather than long-term biosynthetic changes (Roshanravan et al., 2021; Thoma et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the context of sarcopenia, where mitochondrial dysfunction and Ca²⁺ dysregulation contribute significantly to muscle weakness and atrophy, elamipretide is expected to yield several beneficial cellular and physiological effects. The primary anticipated result in the proposed assay is an enhancement in mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, which aids in maintaining optimal mitochondrial metabolic function and supports ATP production. Preservation of MAM contacts and reduced cytosolic Ca²⁺ overload should translate to improved Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and kinetics in aged myotubes, enabling more efficient contraction and improved fatigue resistance (Campbell et al., 2022; Roshanravan et al., 2021). Moreover, since mitochondrial dysfunction is closely linked to reduced muscle bioenergetics and increased oxidative stress, the restoration of mitochondrial membrane integrity by elamipretide is postulated to improve not only Ca²⁺ signaling but also overall muscle endurance and recovery from fatigue (Pepe, 2019; Pharaoh et al., 2023). Most importantly, preclinical data indicate that elamipretide can reverse mitochondrial impairments in aged muscle, which supports the hypothesis that it will have a similar functional impact in assays involving aged myotubes and potentially in clinical models of sarcopenia (Roshanravan et al., 2021; Bellanti et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Elamipretide presents as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of sarcopenia based on its well-characterized mechanism of action, robust preclinical efficacy in improving mitochondrial function, and favorable clinical safety profile in mitochondrial myopathies. One of the key strengths of elamipretide is its targeted mechanism: by binding to cardiolipin and stabilizing mitochondrial membranes, the peptide not only improves ATP production but also reduces ROS formation and preserves critical Ca²⁺ handling structures within mitochondria. This dual action addresses two central contributors to sarcopenia—mitochondrial dysfunction and Ca²⁺ dysregulation—thereby offering a mechanistically sound approach to mitigating muscle degeneration in the elderly (Pepe, 2019; Pharaoh et al., 2023). Additionally, the translational evidence from Phase II clinical trials in primary mitochondrial myopathies and preclinical studies in aged animal models provides strong precedent for its potential repurposing for sarcopenia (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2015; Roshanravan et al., 2021).

However, there are several considerations to note. One potential weakness is the current lack of direct clinical data evaluating the efficacy of elamipretide in sarcopenia specifically; while its mechanism is highly relevant, sarcopenia is a multifactorial disease where additional processes such as inflammation, hormonal changes, and neuromuscular junction degeneration may also play critical roles (Bellanti et al., 2022; Sakellariou et al., 2016). Furthermore, while preclinical models have demonstrated improvements in mitochondrial functions and endurance parameters, translating these benefits into a robust improvement in muscle mass or strength in elderly patients remains an open question. It will be critical to design clinical trials that not only assess biochemical endpoints (such as mitochondrial ATPmax and Ca²⁺ transients) but also include functional outcome measures including muscle strength, endurance, and quality-of-life assessments (Campbell et al., 2023; Roshanravan et al., 2021).

In summary, elamipretide’s capacity to preserve mitochondrial membrane integrity, reduce oxidative stress, and enhance mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake makes it a strong candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic for sarcopenia. Its ability to target mitochondria directly and improve key aspects of cellular bioenergetics addresses core defects associated with sarcopenia. Nonetheless, further investigation is warranted to fully evaluate its clinical efficacy in the context of age-related muscle decline, especially through comprehensive trials designed to capture both molecular improvements and functional muscle outcomes in the elderly population (Pharaoh et al., 2023; Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2017). Overall, while challenges remain, the mechanistic rationale, supportive preclinical evidence, and established clinical safety suggest that elamipretide is a promising therapeutic candidate that merits further exploration in the context of sarcopenia (Unknown Reference; Karaa et al., 2024).
