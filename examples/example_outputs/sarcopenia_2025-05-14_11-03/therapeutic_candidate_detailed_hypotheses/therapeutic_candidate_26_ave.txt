Proposal for AVE-0991

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
AVE-0991 is a fully synthetic small‐molecule compound that acts as a non-peptide agonist at the Mas receptor. It was initially developed to mimic the beneficial actions of the endogenous heptapeptide angiotensin‐(1–7) [Ang-(1–7)], a key component of the alternative, or “protective,” axis of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). Unlike peptide‐based drugs—which are often challenged by poor oral bioavailability and rapid proteolytic degradation—AVE-0991 was engineered to be orally active and resistant to enzymatic degradation. AVE-0991 belongs to a class of compounds that target G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), specifically those that mediate counterregulatory effects opposing the classical angiotensin II (Ang II)/AT₁ receptor axis. This class has been widely studied in the cardiovascular arena, where Mas receptor activation has been shown to mediate vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic effects, and it is increasingly being considered for applications in diseases characterized by tissue degeneration and oxidative stress. The discovery and synthesis of AVE-0991 involved iterative medicinal chemistry optimization to yield a molecule with the appropriate receptor affinity, oral pharmacokinetics, and tissue penetrance needed to activate the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas pathway effectively (Acuña et al., 2014; Murphy et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic candidate AVE-0991 and related non-peptide Mas receptor agonists have been primarily investigated in preclinical studies focused on cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, where activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis confers potent vasorelaxant, anti-fibrotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. In experimental rodent models, AVE-0991 has been shown to recapitulate many of the beneficial actions typically associated with Ang-(1–7) infusion, notably in terms of reducing adverse tissue remodeling and improving overall organ function (Latil et al., 2021; Yamamoto et al., 2020).
While the candidate has not yet been approved or broadly employed in clinical settings for sarcopenia, the preclinical evidence indicates that activation of the Mas receptor can improve skeletal muscle structure and function in disease models that share pathophysiological features with sarcopenia. For example, Ang-(1–7) treatment in mdx mice—a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy—has been shown to normalize muscle architecture, reduce fibrosis, and enhance muscle strength (Acuña et al., 2014). In cancer cachexia models, pharmacological activation of the Mas receptor with compounds analogous to AVE-0991 has led to improvements in whole-body metabolism, muscle mass preservation, and functional outcomes (Murphy et al., 2019). More recently, studies investigating the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas pathway in aging models have consistently demonstrated a decline in skeletal muscle function associated with reduced Ang-(1–7) signaling, along with evidence that activation of this axis in aged mice improves muscle performance (Huang et al., 2021; Takeshita et al., 2023). Although clinical data directly linking AVE-0991 to improved muscle outcomes in sarcopenia are currently sparse, the existing biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature supports repurposing this candidate for age-related muscle dysfunctions given its favorable preclinical profile in related disease models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, AVE-0991 is designed to bind selectively to the Mas receptor, a GPCR expressed on the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle fibers, vascular endothelial cells, and resident satellite cells. Activation of the Mas receptor initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling events that ultimately modulate gene transcription, protein synthesis, and ion channel function. One critical consequence of Mas receptor activation is the induction of nitric oxide (NO) production via the AKT-eNOS pathway, leading to vasodilation and improved microvascular perfusion in skeletal muscle, which is essential for effective nutrient and oxygen delivery (Yamamoto et al., 2020).

In the context of sarcopenia, where oxidative stress, chronic low-grade inflammation, and calcium handling abnormalities are seminal contributors to muscle wasting, AVE-0991’s receptor-mediated activation appears to have several beneficial intracellular effects. First, Mas receptor activation leads to inhibition of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, which is known to drive fibrosis and impair muscle regeneration. By suppressing TGF-β signaling, AVE-0991 may reduce fibrosis in aging muscle, thus preserving the structural integrity and functional capacity of myofibers (Acuña et al., 2014; Cabello‐Verrugio et al., 2015).

Second, a key aspect of AVE-0991’s mechanism is its role in reducing oxidative stress. Chronic overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) contributes to cellular damage and the dysfunction of essential proteins in muscle fibers. The activation of the Mas receptor by AVE-0991 initiates a redox-modulatory signaling cascade that counters ROS production and diminishes NF-κB activation, a central mediator of inflammation. This antioxidant effect is particularly relevant in aged skeletal muscle, where high ROS levels lead to damage of critical calcium-regulating proteins such as the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1). By preserving RyR1 conformation, AVE-0991 is hypothesized to lower sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca²⁺ leak, thereby maintaining proper Ca²⁺ transient amplitudes necessary for effective muscle contraction (Murphy et al., 2019; Takeshita et al., 2023).

Moreover, the improved Ca²⁺ handling and resultant fatigue resistance likely stem from a direct receptor-mediated redox reduction mechanism that helps to stabilize proteins involved in excitation–contraction coupling. Activation of the Mas receptor has been associated with enhanced mitochondrial function and a shift in muscle fiber type composition toward more glycolytic, fast-twitch fibers, which are more resistant to fatigue under conditions of stress (Karnik et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2019). Together, these molecular interactions underscore AVE-0991’s potential to ameliorate several deleterious processes characteristic of sarcopenia, including oxidative damage, inflammation, disrupted calcium homeostasis, and fibrosis.

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assays using aged myotubes, AVE-0991 is expected to produce several quantifiable benefits. Based on its mode of action through Mas receptor activation, the candidate is hypothesized to reduce oxidative stress markers, which can be measured via assays for reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and antioxidant enzyme expression. The normalization of redox state is predicted to preserve the conformation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR1), a critical calcium release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Preservation of RyR1 integrity is essential because, in aged muscle fibers, oxidative modifications often lead to an increased SR Ca²⁺ leak that can result in impaired Ca²⁺ transient amplitude during muscle contraction. Therefore, in a controlled assay, cells treated with AVE-0991 should exhibit a reduced SR Ca²⁺ leak as demonstrated by lower baseline Ca²⁺ release and improved Ca²⁺ transient parameters measured via fluorescence-based Ca²⁺ imaging techniques (Huang et al., 2021; Murphy et al., 2019).

Furthermore, it is anticipated that AVE-0991 will enhance fatigue resistance in aged myotubes by preserving normal Ca²⁺ signaling and contributing to efficient excitation–contraction coupling. Given that the Mas receptor is expressed in skeletal muscle, including in myotubes and satellite cells—cells essential for muscle regeneration—it is reasonable to expect that AVE-0991 will improve not only functional muscle contraction but also overall muscle fiber integrity (Sartiani et al., 2015; Takeshita et al., 2021). In addition, the improved redox balance and preserved SR Ca²⁺ handling are expected to support better cellular metabolism and insulin sensitivity via upregulation of glucose transporter (GLUT4) expression. This action is particularly beneficial in aged skeletal muscle, where insulin resistance is a frequent complication that contributes to reduced protein synthesis and muscle wasting (Huang et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021).

On a functional level, if AVE-0991 treatment results in a measurable improvement in Ca²⁺ transients—such as higher amplitude peaks and a reduced rate of decline—it would confirm that the compound is effectively preserving the integrity of key Ca²⁺ regulatory proteins. As a consequence, treated myotubes should be more resistant to fatigue under repetitive stimulation protocols commonly used in in vitro assays. Translationally, this could correlate with enhanced muscle strength and endurance seen in preclinical models of muscle aging and cachexia, where Mas receptor agonism has previously been linked to improved exercise performance and muscle force generation (Acuña et al., 2014; Murphy et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
AVE-0991 is a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment and prevention of sarcopenia due to its targeted activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas receptor axis. One of the primary strengths of AVE-0991 is its oral bioavailability and well-characterized pharmacokinetic profile in rodent models, which facilitates both preclinical testing and potential clinical translation (Latil et al., 2021; Murphy et al., 2019). Its receptor-mediated mechanism allows for a specific redox reduction effect that preserves critical proteins such as RyR1, thereby improving SR Ca²⁺ handling, enhancing Ca²⁺ transient amplitude, and increasing fatigue resistance—a constellation of effects particularly relevant in combating the muscle weakness observed in sarcopenia (Murphy et al., 2019; Takeshita et al., 2023).

Biochemically, the compound’s mechanism is well-supported by literature showing that Mas receptor activation counteracts the detrimental effects of excessive Ang II and its associated pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic signals. By inhibiting TGF-β/Smad signaling and reducing NF-κB activation, AVE-0991 is predicted to lower fibrosis and preserve muscle contractility in aged tissues (Acuña et al., 2014; Cabello‐Verrugio et al., 2015). This dual action—ameliorating oxidative stress and reducing fibrotic remodeling—is a particularly attractive therapeutic strategy given the multifactorial pathology of sarcopenia.

In terms of therapeutic history, although AVE-0991 itself has not yet been tested clinically for sarcopenia, its efficacy in related conditions such as muscular dystrophy and cancer cachexia indicates that the Mas receptor is a valid target for muscle preservation. Preclinical studies in these models have consistently demonstrated that activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis improves muscle function, reduces fibrosis, and enhances overall structural integrity of the muscle tissue (Acuña et al., 2014; Murphy et al., 2019). This literature provides a strong rationale for further evaluating AVE-0991 in sarcopenia models.

Nevertheless, there are certain weaknesses and gaps that must be acknowledged. First, while the proposed mechanism of action—preserving RyR1 conformation and limiting SR Ca²⁺ leak—is biologically plausible and supported by preclinical data in other muscle wasting contexts, direct experimental validation of these mechanisms specifically in the context of aging myotubes remains limited. In addition, while the Mas receptor is clearly expressed in skeletal muscle, further quantitative characterization of its expression levels and downstream signaling in aged human myotubes compared with animal models is needed to substantiate translational potential (Sartiani et al., 2015; Takeshita et al., 2021). Moreover, although improved fatigue resistance is anticipated, the extent to which AVE-0991 can reverse established sarcopenic muscle pathology versus merely preventing further deterioration must be rigorously tested.

Another potential challenge is the complex nature of sarcopenia, which, unlike monogenic muscle disorders, is a multifactorial condition influenced by hormonal changes, chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuromuscular alterations. As such, while AVE-0991’s mechanism addresses key factors such as oxidative stress and Ca²⁺ handling, it may need to be combined with other therapies or lifestyle interventions (e.g., exercise, nutritional optimization) to achieve maximal clinical benefit. Nonetheless, the fact that AVE-0991 acts through a well-defined receptor-mediated pathway offers the advantage of a targeted approach, reducing the likelihood of widespread off-target effects often seen with broader-acting agents.

In summary, AVE-0991 emerges as a strong candidate for further preclinical and eventually clinical evaluation in sarcopenia. Its strengths lie in its oral bioavailability, specific mechanism of Mas receptor activation leading to redox stabilization and improved calcium homeostasis, and a growing body of preclinical evidence indicating beneficial effects on muscle physiology. Weaknesses include the need for more direct data in aged myotubes and sarcopenia models as well as the inherent complexity of muscle aging as compared to other forms of muscle wasting. Given the comprehensive biochemical, translational, and mechanistic support from studies showing that activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas receptor axis improves muscle function (Acuña et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2021; Murphy et al., 2019; Sartiani et al., 2015; Takeshita et al., 2023), further investigation and validation of AVE-0991 in models of sarcopenia is warranted. The promising receptor-mediated redox reduction mechanism—specifically preserving Ca²⁺ channel integrity and improving Ca²⁺ transients—supports the translational feasibility of this approach. For these reasons, continued research into AVE-0991 is recommended, with particular emphasis on detailed in vitro assays using aged myotubes and rigorous in vivo models of sarcopenia to fully characterize its therapeutic potential and define optimal dosing strategies before moving into clinical trials.

Overall, the team should consider proceeding with additional mechanistic studies that evaluate not only the antioxidant and antifibrotic effects of AVE-0991 but also its impact on muscle contractility, satellite cell activation, and whole-body metabolic profile. Such comprehensive preclinical data will be critical to build a robust case for clinical evaluation in aging populations afflicted with sarcopenia (Murphy et al., 2019; Takeshita et al., 2023; Yamamoto et al., 2020).
