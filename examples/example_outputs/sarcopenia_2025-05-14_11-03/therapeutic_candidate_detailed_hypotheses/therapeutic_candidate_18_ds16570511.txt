Proposal for DS16570511

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
DS16570511 is a small‐molecule modulator discovered through high‐throughput screening of extensive compound libraries (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 1–2). Originally identified as a cell‐permeable compound that targets the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), DS16570511 belongs to the class of small molecules designed to modulate mitochondrial calcium (Ca²⁺) transport. Its discovery was driven by the need to overcome limitations associated with earlier MCU modulators such as Ruthenium Red and Ru360, which suffer from poor cell permeability and limited specificity (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19). As a candidate, DS16570511 was initially characterized in cellular and ex vivo heart models, where it demonstrated the ability to block mitochondrial Ca²⁺ influx, thereby preventing mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overload. Despite the therapeutic hypothesis proposing it as an MCU activator for enhancement of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake in aged myotubes, the literature consistently characterizes DS16570511 as an inhibitor rather than an activator of the MCU (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 4–5; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19). The general class of compounds to which DS16570511 belongs has been used experimentally to modulate mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signaling in cardiac and neuronal systems, with the intent of ameliorating injury associated with calcium overload. However, its chemical synthesis details and structural optimization have been reported only in the context of preclinical studies and not through extensive therapeutic development pipelines (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 1–2).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, DS16570511 has been evaluated in preclinical models, particularly in the context of cardiac ischemia–reperfusion injury and neuronal excitotoxicity. Its ability to suppress mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overload in Langendorff‐perfused rat hearts and to modulate Ca²⁺ dynamics in HEK293A cells by blocking MCU‐dependent Ca²⁺ influx has been documented (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 5–6; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19). To date, there is no published evidence that DS16570511, or other members of this compound class, has been used clinically or in veterinary settings to treat sarcopenia or related muscle wasting diseases. Preclinical data focus predominantly on cardiac models where inhibition of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake resulted in improvements in cardiac contractility and protection against Ca²⁺ overload-induced injury, not on enhancing mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake as would be required to counteract the energy deficits associated with sarcopenia (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Arnst et al., 2022, pp. 20–21). Additionally, while other natural compounds (e.g., kaempferol) have been shown to act as MCU activators with putative benefits on cellular metabolism, DS16570511 has not been demonstrated to have any precedent or prior therapeutic use in the treatment of skeletal muscle degenerative conditions (Li et al., 2025, pp. 6–8; Zampieri et al., 2016, pp. 1–2).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, DS16570511 has been extensively characterized as an inhibitor of the MCU complex. The MCU is a highly selective Ca²⁺ channel located in the inner mitochondrial membrane that mediates the uptake of Ca²⁺ into the mitochondrial matrix. This process is essential for the activation of Ca²⁺-sensitive dehydrogenases in the Krebs cycle, thereby coupling cytosolic Ca²⁺ transients to mitochondrial ATP production (Mammucari et al., 2015, pp. 1–3). DS16570511, during in vitro studies, has been shown to dose-dependently block both MCU-dependent and MICU1-dependent increases in mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake. The compound achieves this by binding—directly or indirectly—to components of the uniporter complex, thereby reducing Ca²⁺ influx into the mitochondria (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 4–6). This inhibitory activity has been linked to an enhancement in cardiac contractility observed in isolated heart models, presumably due to the prevention of Ca²⁺ overload that would otherwise lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent cell injury (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 5–6; Morciano et al., 2022, pp. 9–10). Importantly, DS16570511 exhibits off-target effects, including alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential, with some studies reporting mitochondrial depolarization, which raises concerns regarding its specificity and safety (Shumanska et al., 2023, pp. 52–55; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19). The known molecular interactions suggest that DS16570511 effectively suppresses mitochondrial Ca²⁺ influx rather than enhancing it; this is in direct contrast to the therapeutic hypothesis proposing that it functions as an “MCU activator” to boost mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake. Additionally, the literature does not provide any biochemical data to support a mechanism of action consistent with MCU activation in any cell type, including skeletal muscle cells (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Cui et al., 2019, pp. 11–12).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underlying the repurposing of DS16570511 for sarcopenia posits that enhancing mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake in aged myotubes could rebalance cytosolic Ca²⁺ transients, improve ATP production, and thereby sustain contraction and recovery kinetics. In muscle tissue, mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake plays a critical role in stimulating metabolic enzymes and matching energy production with the contractile demands of the muscle fiber (Mammucari et al., 2015, pp. 1–3; Zampieri et al., 2016, pp. 1–2). In theory, an MCU activator would boost these processes and help to counteract the mitochondrial dysfunction that is observed in sarcopenic muscle. However, DS16570511, as characterized in the literature, acts as an inhibitor of the MCU, thereby reducing Ca²⁺ uptake into the mitochondria. Consequently, rather than rebalancing cytosolic Ca²⁺ transients by enhancing mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, DS16570511 may decrease mitochondrial Ca²⁺ levels, potentially compromising the activation of Ca²⁺-sensitive metabolic enzymes required for efficient ATP production (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 4–5; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19). Additionally, skeletal muscle expresses MCU and its regulatory subunits, and mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake is indeed critical for muscle bioenergetics (Mammucari et al., 2015, pp. 1–3; Zampieri et al., 2016, pp. 1–2); however, the expected anabolic or metabolic benefits in myotubes would require an increase in mitochondrial Ca²⁺, not its inhibition. Therefore, if DS16570511 is used in the proposed assay on aged myotubes, the drug is more likely to decrease mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake and may even exacerbate energy production deficits rather than improving contraction and recovery kinetics. There is significant literature supporting the idea that enhanced MCU activity is beneficial in muscle cells; indeed, activation of MCU (or increasing its expression) has been associated with muscle hypertrophy and improved bioenergetics (Zampieri et al., 2016, pp. 1–2; Coen et al., 2019, pp. 6–7). Because DS16570511 does not act as an activator but rather as an inhibitor, its expected effect in the proposed assay would likely be counterproductive relative to the therapeutic objectives of treating sarcopenia (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 5–6; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, while DS16570511 is a well-characterized small molecule capable of modulating mitochondrial Ca²⁺ transport through its action on the MCU complex, the extensive literature identifies it unequivocally as an inhibitor rather than an activator (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19). The therapeutic hypothesis for its repurposing in sarcopenia relies on the assumption that DS16570511 enhances mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake and thereby improves ATP production, contributing to improved myotube contraction and recovery. However, the available preclinical and biochemical studies indicate that DS16570511 reduces mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, a mechanism beneficial in cardiac and neuronal protection settings but likely deleterious for skeletal muscle where enhanced mitochondrial Ca²⁺ is required for metabolic matching and energy production (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 5–6; Li et al., 2025, pp. 6–8). Furthermore, DS16570511’s off-target effects, including its impact on mitochondrial membrane potential and the induction of mitochondrial permeability transition, raise additional safety concerns that would need careful evaluation before any repurposing for chronic conditions like sarcopenia could be considered (Shumanska et al., 2023, pp. 52–55; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19). Although restoring mitochondrial bioenergetics is a promising strategy to counteract age-related muscle degeneration—as demonstrated by various interventions that enhance mitochondrial function through increased Ca²⁺ uptake and improved redox balance (Zampieri et al., 2016, pp. 1–2; Coen et al., 2019, pp. 6–7)—DS16570511 does not fulfill the role of an MCU activator; instead, its inhibitory properties are at odds with the proposed therapeutic mechanism for sarcopenia. Based on this comprehensive review, the repurposing of DS16570511 for sarcopenia is not supported by the existing literature. Its strengths lie in its drug-like properties (cell permeability and specificity in certain experimental settings) and its capacity to modulate mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake in contexts where inhibition is protective. However, its classification as an inhibitor, rather than an activator, its potential off-target effects, and the lack of evidence linking its use to improved skeletal muscle function or attenuation of sarcopenia represent significant weaknesses for the intended therapeutic application (Kon et al., 2017, pp. 5–6; Modesti et al., 2021, pp. 17–19; Morciano et al., 2022, pp. 8–9). Therefore, while the overall strategy of targeting mitochondrial Ca²⁺ homeostasis is promising for sarcopenia, DS16570511 itself is not a viable candidate in its current form for this indication, and alternative small-molecule MCU activators or approaches that enhance mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake should be explored instead (Cacciatore et al., 2024, pp. 16–18; Chen et al., 2023, pp. 13–15).
