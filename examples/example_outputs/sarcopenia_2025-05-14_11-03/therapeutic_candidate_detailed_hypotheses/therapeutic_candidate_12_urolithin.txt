Proposal for Urolithin A

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Urolithin A is a naturally occurring metabolite produced by the gut microbiota through the transformation of dietary ellagitannins and ellagic acid—polyphenolic compounds that are abundant in foods such as pomegranates, berries, and walnuts. In the digestive tract, ingested ellagitannins are hydrolyzed to yield ellagic acid, which downstream gut microbial enzymes convert into a series of urolithins, with Urolithin A emerging as one of the most bioactive and abundantly studied compounds in this family (Alldritt et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2023). Urolithin A belongs to a class of bioavailable polyphenol metabolites known broadly as urolithins. By virtue of its microbial origin, Urolithin A represents a type of postbiotic—a compound whose formation is dependent on both dietary intake and the specific enzymatic repertoire of an individual’s microbiome. This natural compound has been isolated from biological samples, and its production has also been replicated through synthetic chemistry approaches, relying on reagents such as 2-bromo-5-hydroxybenzoic acid and resorcinol in copper sulfate–catalyzed processes to achieve high purity (Lin et al., 2023). The class of urolithins, as a whole, has been previously studied for a variety of biological effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and mitophagy‐promoting actions, which have been linked with improved metabolic and muscular outcomes (Shetty et al., 2024; Rodriguez et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
Over the past decade, Urolithin A has emerged as a promising candidate for addressing conditions related to mitochondrial dysfunction, aging, and muscle degeneration. Early clinical investigations have focused on its capacity to improve muscle mitochondrial function and exercise endurance in older subjects. Several registered clinical trials, including those identified by ClinicalTrials.gov searches for “Urolithin A AND (sarcopenia OR muscle OR aging)” and specific studies like NCT03283462 and NCT06556706 (ClinicalTrials.gov; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024), have evaluated its potential to improve muscle strength, endurance, and overall bioenergetics in aged populations. In these studies, endpoints such as 6-minute walk test distance, ATP synthesis rates via Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, and muscle biopsy assessments of mitochondrial markers were used to gauge efficacy. Complementary preclinical studies in animal models have also demonstrated that Urolithin A induces mitophagy, extends lifespan in organisms like Caenorhabditis elegans, and improves muscle function in rodents, including models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Faitg et al., 2024). These studies have provided proof-of-concept evidence that Urolithin A can reverse age-associated declines in mitochondrial activity and muscle performance, providing rationale for further exploration in the context of sarcopenia—a condition characterized by reduced muscle mass, strength, and functional capacity (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
The therapeutic potential of Urolithin A in treating sarcopenia lies principally in its ability to activate mitophagy—the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria—and thereby restore mitochondrial quality and function in aging muscle cells. At the molecular level, Urolithin A has been shown to upregulate markers of mitophagy, such as Parkin and PINK1, which are critical for identifying and tagging dysfunctional mitochondria for autophagic removal (Faitg et al., 2024). In aged myotubes, and particularly in conditions of sarcopenia, mitochondrial dysfunction plays a significant role in impairing cellular energy production. Urolithin A reportedly induces a cascade of events that culminates in the restoration of mitochondrial–sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) contact sites. These specialized junctions, often referred to as mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAMs), are integral for coupling SR Ca²⁺ release to mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, a critical process underlying efficient bioenergetic responses during contraction (Unknown Reference). Restoration of these contact sites ensures that mitochondria not only receive Ca²⁺ signals necessary for activating oxidative phosphorylation but also help buffer cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels, thereby refining the kinetics of Ca²⁺ transients that drive muscle contraction (Ghosh et al., 2022; Nishimoto et al., 2023).

Biochemically, Urolithin A exerts its effects by modulating pathways that converge on mitochondrial homeostasis. It appears to activate components of the autophagic machinery that enhance the degradation of impaired mitochondria, simultaneously promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and reorganization of mitochondrial networks (Hou et al., 2024). Specifically, it increases the expression of key proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics and quality control, such as those in the PINK1-Parkin pathway, and may also interact with other regulatory molecules that control the structural integrity of the mitochondria–SR interface. The integrity of this interface is crucial, as it governs the efficiency of Ca²⁺ signals that initiate ATP production during muscle contraction. Moreover, Urolithin A’s impact on mitochondrial function indirectly affects the overall redox state and energy balance within muscle cells, providing a protective mechanism against the oxidative stress typically encountered in aged or diseased muscle (Lin et al., 2023; Madsen et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay focused on aged myotubes and muscle tissue, Urolithin A is expected to exert a multifaceted therapeutic effect. First, by activating mitophagy, it is anticipated to clear dysfunctional mitochondria, allowing for the generation of a healthier mitochondrial population. This restoration of mitochondrial health is expected to normalize mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, a process critical for modulating ATP synthesis and coordinating Ca²⁺ transients with SR release events during muscle contraction. Given the central role of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ handling in bioenergetics and contractility, improved mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake should enhance the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, leading directly to increased contractile endurance of muscle fibers (Faitg et al., 2024; Nishimoto et al., 2023).

Furthermore, by restoring mitochondrial–SR contact sites, Urolithin A is predicted to re-establish the precise spatial and functional coupling necessary for rapid and controlled Ca²⁺ transfer between the SR and mitochondria. This re-coupling is especially crucial in aged muscle, where disorganized organelle networks contribute to impaired Ca²⁺ dynamics and diminished muscle strength. The normalization of Ca²⁺ transient kinetics is likely to be reflected in increased muscle endurance and reduced fatigue during repetitive or sustained contractions, which are key clinical manifestations of sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; Nishimoto et al., 2023).

At the molecular level, studies in human volunteers and animal models have demonstrated that Urolithin A supplementation leads to an upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis markers, a decrease in plasma acylcarnitine levels (indicative of improved fatty acid oxidation), and a reduction in inflammatory cytokines that are often elevated in aging muscle (Hou et al., 2024; Faitg et al., 2024). The convergence of these effects supports the hypothesis that Urolithin A will improve muscle bioenergetics and contractile performance through a mechanism that integrates enhanced mitochondrial quality control with the preservation of intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis. Thus, in the assay context, one would expect a significant improvement in the parameters associated with mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, enhanced contractile endurance, and a restoration of normal Ca²⁺ transient kinetics in aged myotubes (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Ghosh et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
The collective body of evidence suggests that Urolithin A is a promising therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia. Among its strengths is its natural origin and established safety profile; multiple clinical trials have confirmed that Urolithin A is orally bioavailable, well tolerated, and capable of exerting beneficial effects on mitochondrial health in older adults (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; Heilman et al., 2017). Its ability to target mitochondrial dysfunction—a central aspect of the pathophysiology of sarcopenia—by activating mitophagy and restoring mitochondrial–SR contact sites directly addresses key mechanisms underlying muscle aging and weakness (Faitg et al., 2024; Nishimoto et al., 2023).

The specific mechanism of restoring mitochondrial–SR coupling and normalizing Ca²⁺ uptake represents a novel strategy that goes beyond traditional approaches such as direct muscle stimulation or anti-inflammatory therapies. This mechanism leverages the intrinsic cellular repair processes to re-establish bioenergetic balance and improve contractile function, which are vital for mitigating the functional deficits seen in sarcopenia. Preclinical studies further support this approach by demonstrating improvements in muscle strength and endurance, along with molecular signatures indicative of enhanced mitochondrial function (Unknown Reference; Faitg et al., 2024; Ghosh et al., 2022).

On the other hand, several weaknesses or challenges remain. First, there is significant inter-individual variability in natural Urolithin A production due to differences in gut microbiome composition. Consequently, while supplementation can overcome this variability, it remains to be fully elucidated whether chronic administration in a broader sarcopenic population will yield uniformly positive outcomes (Nishimoto et al., 2023; Shetty et al., 2024). Secondly, while multiple clinical trials have demonstrated improvements in muscle endurance and mitochondrial health, endpoint measures that directly correlate with clinically meaningful improvements in sarcopenia—such as increases in lean muscle mass or improvements in physical performance scores—are still emerging and require further validation in larger-scale phase III studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2025).

Additionally, while the proposed mechanism involving restoration of mitochondrial–SR contact sites is compelling, it remains mechanistically complex with potential off-target effects that are not yet fully characterized. The relationship between Ca²⁺ transient kinetics, mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, and overall muscle performance is influenced by a multitude of regulatory proteins and signaling pathways. Fine-tuning these interactions through Urolithin A supplementation might require careful dose optimization to avoid unintended disruptions in Ca²⁺ homeostasis (Faitg et al., 2024; Shetty et al., 2024). Another consideration is the long‐term safety profile of chronic Urolithin A administration in a patient population that is typically elderly and may have multiple comorbidities; however, early-phase clinical data so far have suggested a favorable safety profile (Heilman et al., 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018).

In summary, Urolithin A represents a strong candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for sarcopenia due to its well-supported mechanism in promoting mitophagy, restoring mitochondrial–SR connectivity, and normalizing Ca²⁺ handling in muscle cells. Its successful translation is further bolstered by robust preclinical studies and emerging clinical evidence, all of which point to improvements in muscle endurance and bioenergetics in aged populations. The strengths of this candidate include its natural derivation from dietary polyphenols, established oral bioavailability, multifaceted mechanism of action targeting mitochondrial quality control, and early evidence of efficacy in enhancing muscle performance. Weaknesses include inter-individual variability in gut microbial metabolism that necessitates supplementation, the need for further validation in large-scale clinical studies, and the potential complexities of modulating intracellular Ca²⁺ dynamics in aged or diseased muscle tissue.

Overall, from a drug development perspective, Urolithin A is a promising candidate that aligns with a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of sarcopenia. The available biochemical, clinical, and mechanistic data support its further investigation through well-designed clinical trials that focus specifically on endpoints relevant to muscle mass, strength, and functional performance in elderly subjects afflicted by sarcopenia. Future studies should aim to optimize dosing regimens, evaluate long-term impacts on muscle quality and functional outcomes, and further elucidate the molecular pathways involved in its action, including its influence on mitochondrial–SR contact sites and Ca²⁺ handling. Given these factors, Urolithin A merits continued preclinical and clinical development as a repurposed drug candidate for the treatment of sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Faitg et al., 2024; Nishimoto et al., 2023; Shetty et al., 2024).
