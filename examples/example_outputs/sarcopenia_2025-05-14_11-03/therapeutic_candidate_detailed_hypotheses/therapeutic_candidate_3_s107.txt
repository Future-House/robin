Proposal for S107 (K201/JTV519)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
S107, also known by its alternate names K201 and JTV519, is a synthetic small molecule belonging to the Rycal class of compounds. Originally discovered and developed for its cardioprotective properties, S107 emerged from efforts to stabilize ryanodine receptors (RyRs), the intracellular Ca²⁺ release channels that govern excitation–contraction (E–C) coupling in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. Chemically, S107 is a derivative of the 1,4-benzothiazepine class, and its development involved systematic structure–activity relationship studies to enhance its specificity for the RyR channel complex. It was designed to bind near the site where the regulatory protein FKBP12 (also known as calstabin1 in skeletal muscle) interacts with RyR1, thereby reinforcing this interaction. Rycals like S107 have previously been used to correct abnormal Ca²⁺ leak in various contexts such as heart failure, muscular dystrophy, and stress-induced muscle fatigue by stabilizing the closed state of the RyR channels and preventing the dissociation of FKBP12 (Andersson & Marks, 2010; Bellinger et al., 2008). This candidate is therefore being repurposed from its initial application in cardiomyopathy to address the pathological calcium dysregulation that underlies sarcopenia—a condition characterized by age-related muscle weakness and atrophy. The natural origins of S107 are synthetic in nature; its chemical synthesis was optimized for oral bioavailability and in vivo stability, essential characteristics for any drug intended for chronic administration in aged patients (Andersson & Marks, 2010).

Therapeutic History:
S107 has a well-documented history in preclinical therapeutic research. Initially, this compound was explored for its ability to stabilize RyR channels in the context of heart failure, where dysfunctional RyR2 channels lose their stabilizing calstabin subunits, leading to arrhythmogenic Ca²⁺ leak. Several studies have shown that by enhancing the binding of calstabin to RyR channels, S107 improves cardiac contractility and reduces arrhythmias in animal models (Wehrens et al., 2005; Andersson & Marks, 2010). Beyond its cardiovascular applications, S107 has been assessed for its potential in skeletal muscle disorders including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). In these conditions, excessive Ca²⁺ leak from RyR1 due to oxidation, nitrosylation, and phosphorylation results in impaired muscle force generation and contributes to muscle degeneration (Andersson et al., 2012; Umanskaya et al., 2012). Notably, preclinical models of muscular dystrophy have demonstrated that treatment with S107 can restore intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis, improve tetanic Ca²⁺ transients, increase specific force production, and even enhance exercise capacity (Umanskaya et al., 2012; Bellinger et al., 2008). Although research directly targeting sarcopenia with S107 is less abundant, the mechanistic similarities between RyR1-mediated Ca²⁺ leak in dystrophic conditions and age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction have fueled interest in repurposing S107 for sarcopenia. In aged muscle, alterations in RyR1 channel function—such as increased oxidation and decreased binding of FKBP12—lead to chronic Ca²⁺ leak and impaired excitation–contraction coupling (Agrawal et al., 2018; Andersson et al., 2011). Preclinical studies in aged rodents have already demonstrated that Rycal compounds can improve muscle function even without concomitant changes in muscle mass, signifying an improvement in muscle quality rather than quantity (Andersson et al., 2012; Forrester, 2018). Such findings provide a strong rationale for further investigating S107 in the context of sarcopenia, particularly given its established safety profile in rodent studies and its oral bioavailability.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, S107 acts by binding to a regulatory region on the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1), which is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle. Under normal physiological conditions, RyR1 is coupled to the stabilizing protein FKBP12 (calstabin1) that maintains the receptor in its closed, non-leaky state during muscle relaxation. In the aging process and in various myopathies, RyR1 undergoes pathological post-translational modifications including oxidation, S-nitrosylation, and hyperphosphorylation. These modifications reduce the binding affinity of FKBP12, leading to dissociation of this regulatory subunit and resulting in an increased open probability (Po) of the RyR1 channel. The chronic Ca²⁺ leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) thus initiated not only disrupts Ca²⁺ homeostasis but also triggers deleterious downstream signaling events such as activation of calpain proteases and mitochondrial dysfunction (Andersson et al., 2011; Forrester, 2018). S107 specifically binds near the FKBP12 regulatory site on RyR1, reinstating the association between FKBP12 and the channel. This stabilization reduces the pathological Ca²⁺ leak and normalizes the excitation–contraction (E–C) coupling process. Electrophysiological studies in both dystrophic and aged muscle models have shown that S107 effectively lowers the open probability of the “leaky” RyR1 channels, thereby improving tetanic Ca²⁺ transients and overall muscle function (Andersson et al., 2011; Umanskaya et al., 2012). The binding of S107 does not reverse the underlying oxidative modifications per se but rather acts to “lock” the RyR1 channel in a state less susceptible to leak by ensuring that FKBP12 remains bound—a mechanism that is critical for maintaining SR Ca²⁺ store integrity and proper Ca²⁺ release upon muscle activation (Andersson et al., 2011; Dridi et al., 2022). In summary, S107 operates by correcting the abnormal molecular conformation of RyR1 that arises in aging, ensuring that excitation–contraction coupling is preserved through maintained intracellular Ca²⁺ signaling fidelity.

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing S107 in sarcopenia is that it will reinstate the stable association of FKBP12 with RyR1 in aged skeletal myotubes, thereby curbing chronic SR Ca²⁺ leak and recovering the amplitude and reliability of Ca²⁺ transients that are essential for proper muscle contraction. This effect is expected to manifest in several measurable improvements. First, restoration of normal Ca²⁺ signaling should lead to an increased amplitude of tetanic Ca²⁺ transients during muscle excitation. Enhanced Ca²⁺ release results in more efficient coupling between electrical stimulation and muscle contraction, which is observable as improved muscle-specific force generation. Indeed, previous ex vivo studies have reported that treatment with S107 can normalize Ca²⁺ transient amplitudes and enhance contractile strength even in muscle fibers that are compromised by pathological Ca²⁺ leak (Agrawal et al., 2018; Andersson et al., 2011). Second, by reducing pathological Ca²⁺ leak, S107 should diminish the chronic activation of Ca²⁺-dependent proteases (such as calpains) that contribute to muscle protein degradation and atrophy. This protective effect indirectly supports better muscle function over time without necessarily increasing muscle mass, thus improving muscle quality, a key parameter in sarcopenia. Third, stabilization of the RyR1 channel may also interrupt the deleterious feed-forward cycle that links Ca²⁺ dysregulation to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, as abnormal Ca²⁺ handling can lead to mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overload and subsequent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Improvement in mitochondrial function is critical for sustaining muscle endurance and fatigue resistance, particularly in the context of aging (Andersson et al., 2012; Dridi et al., 2020). Moreover, the candidate has been shown to be orally bioavailable and well-tolerated in rodent studies, suggesting favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. In the context of assays using aged myotubes or muscle fibers, we would expect that S107 treatment would result in enhanced Ca²⁺ transient amplitude under controlled stimulation protocols, decreased resting cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels indicative of reduced leak, and improved contractile performance under fatigue protocols. These effects have been corroborated by previous biochemical and electrophysiological studies in both dystrophic and aged muscle, where administration of S107 led to normalization of RyR1 function (Andersson et al., 2011; Forrester, 2018). Additionally, since human skeletal muscle expresses RyR1 and its regulatory protein FKBP12—with expression patterns well conserved between rodents and humans—the expected molecular interactions are directly relevant to the target cell type in sarcopenia (Meyer et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
In synthesizing the available literature across biochemical, clinical, and preclinical studies, S107 emerges as a highly promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia. Its mechanism—to stabilize RyR1 via enhanced FKBP12 binding—addresses a central pathophysiological process in age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction: the chronic, pathological leak of Ca²⁺ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum that disrupts excitation–contraction coupling and triggers deleterious downstream effects such as protease activation and mitochondrial stress. The strengths of S107 include its well-characterized mechanism of action, evident from studies employing electrophysiological measurements that demonstrate a normalization of RyR1 channel open probability and restoration of Ca²⁺ transient amplitudes (Andersson et al., 2011; Umanskaya et al., 2012). Its oral bioavailability and established tolerability in rodent models are significant advantages, particularly for long-term treatment paradigms such as those required in chronic age-related conditions. Moreover, its previous applications in models of muscular dystrophy—and by extension, in conditions marked by similar RyR1 remodeling—suggest that the molecular defect targeted by S107 is common to multiple forms of muscle weakness, thereby broadening its potential utility (Andersson et al., 2012; Bellinger et al., 2008).

However, there are also caveats that warrant careful consideration. Although the preclinical data are highly supportive, direct clinical evidence in human sarcopenia remains limited. Most studies have been performed in rodent models or in the context of muscular dystrophy, and while mechanistic similarities are compelling, clinical translation may uncover unforeseen complexities given the multifactorial nature of sarcopenia. Sarcopenia in humans is not solely driven by RyR1-mediated Ca²⁺ leak; hormonal changes, systemic inflammation, neuromuscular junction alterations, and physical inactivity all contribute to its progression. Therefore, while S107 may address a critical component of the disease pathology, it might need to be combined with other interventions to achieve optimal clinical benefit. Additionally, the long-term safety profile in the elderly population, who often present with comorbidities and polypharmacy, requires rigorous evaluation. Off-target effects have been a concern with earlier RyR modulators, though S107 has been noted for its relatively high target specificity compared to preceding molecules such as JTV519 (Andersson & Marks, 2010; Kushnir & Marks, 2012).

From a biochemical perspective, the proposed mechanism is robust. Numerous studies have verified that the maintenance of FKBP12 binding to RyR1 is critical for preventing pathological Ca²⁺ leak, which in turn supports proper excitation–contraction coupling. The detailed molecular interactions, including the role of post-translational modifications such as oxidation and nitrosylation on RyR1 that predispose it to FKBP12 dissociation, are well established. S107’s ability to counteract these modifications, not by directly reversing them but by reinforcing the channel’s closed state, fits neatly into our current understanding of muscle physiology and pathology (Andersson et al., 2011; Dridi et al., 2020). FRET-based evidence provided by Rebbeck et al. (Sci Rep, 2020)—although not included in our current context—aligns with data from other studies showing improved FKBP12–RyR1 binding after S107 treatment (Agrawal et al., 2018). This convergence of independent lines of evidence strengthens the mechanistic underpinning of the candidate’s expected effects.

Regarding the expected effect, the restoration of proper Ca²⁺ signaling in aged skeletal myotubes is a particularly attractive outcome. Increased amplitude and consistency of Ca²⁺ transients should translate into enhanced muscle contractility and resistance to fatigue. This is critical not only for improving physical performance and quality of life in elderly individuals but also for potentially slowing the progression of muscle atrophy that characterizes sarcopenia. Given that sarcopenia involves a decline in muscle function that often precedes measurable loss in muscle mass, the beneficial effects of S107 on muscle quality—as opposed to mere muscle size—are especially valuable (Agrawal et al., 2018; Forrester, 2018).

In summary, S107 has demonstrated considerable promise as a therapeutic candidate for conditions related to dysfunctional Ca²⁺ handling, including various forms of muscular dystrophy and potentially sarcopenia. Its mechanism of action is mechanistically coherent and supported by data from rigorous biochemical and electrophysiological studies that document its ability to stabilize RyR1 channels by preserving FKBP12 binding. The fact that S107 is orally bioavailable with an acceptable safety profile in preclinical studies further bolsters its candidacy. Nonetheless, careful attention must be paid to the inherent complexity of sarcopenia as a multifactorial disease, and future studies should aim to validate these findings in clinical settings with aged human populations. Strengths of S107 include its precise mechanism of action, strong preclinical data, and potential to improve muscle quality by directly correcting a key molecular defect, while weaknesses pertain primarily to the limited clinical validation in sarcopenia per se and the need for a comprehensive safety evaluation in an older demographic. Overall, the literature reviewed provides a compelling rationale for advancing S107 into further preclinical and early-phase clinical trials for sarcopenia, with the expectation that its ability to restore proper Ca²⁺ homeostasis could afford significant functional benefits to aging skeletal muscle (Andersson et al., 2011; Dridi et al., 2020; Umanskaya et al., 2012).
