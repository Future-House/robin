Proposal for FKBP12.6-mimetic peptide (Peptide sequence FRLCLARK)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
The candidate under evaluation is a synthetic peptide based on a 10–amino acid FKBP12.6-mimetic sequence, specifically incorporating the FRLCLARK motif. This peptide has been rationally designed to mimic the binding properties of the endogenous FKBP12.6 protein—a small immunophilin that normally stabilizes ryanodine receptors (RyRs) by binding them and maintaining their closed state. FKBP12.6 is known to be a critical regulator of intracellular Ca²⁺ release channels, and in skeletal muscle, stabilization of RyR1 by FKBP12 (or by similar mimetics) is essential for maintaining controlled Ca²⁺ release during excitation–contraction coupling. The synthetic peptide belongs to a class of therapeutic agents that utilize peptide‐based mimetics to replicate the interaction interfaces of endogenous regulatory proteins. This category has been extensively explored relative to small molecule “Rycal” compounds (such as S107) that have demonstrated capacity for correcting pathological Ca²⁺ leak by enhancing the association of FKBP with RyRs in preclinical models (Andersson et al., 2011). Moreover, this peptide is engineered with cell‐penetrating capabilities to allow intracellular delivery, which is a critical aspect since the therapeutic target is the oxidized RyR1 complex in aged human myotubes (Andersson et al., 2011).

Therapeutic History:
The use of FKBP-based therapeutic mimetics is rooted in extensive biochemical and pharmacological research on RyR stabilization. Prior studies have shown that small molecules known as Rycals, like S107 (a Rycal analog), can mitigate the abnormal Ca²⁺ leak originating from oxidized and destabilized RyR1 channels in aged muscle, thereby improving muscle contractility, mitochondrial function, and exercise capacity in aged mouse models (Andersson et al., 2011; Marks, 2023). Although traditional Rycals are small molecules, the concept of directly replacing the lost stabilizing effect of FKBP by using synthetic FKBP-mimetic peptides—specifically ones based on sequences such as FRLCLARK—has been proposed as an alternative, more targeted approach (Dong & Maturana, 2025). To date, FKBP12.6-mimetic peptides have been explored in preclinical contexts to bind RyR regulatory sites in vitro, effectively reproducing some of the Rycal effects observed with small molecule interventions in both cardiac and skeletal muscle models (Marks, 2023; Kreko-Pierce et al., 2016). There is no direct clinical trial record for FKBP12.6-mimetic peptides for sarcopenia, as searches on ClinicalTrials.gov have returned no results for this specific candidate, highlighting that their application remains within the preclinical and investigative stage (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In parallel, the extensive work on RyR stabilization in models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and age-related muscle weakness illustrates that restoring FKBP binding to RyR1 is a validated approach for ameliorating muscle dysfunction (Santulli & Marks, 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, the physiological maintenance of excitation–contraction coupling in skeletal muscle relies on the precisely regulated release of Ca²⁺ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through RyR1 channels. Endogenous FKBP12 (and its analog FKBP12.6) binds these channels to favor the closed state and prevent spontaneous Ca²⁺ leak. However, with aging, oxidative modifications including oxidation and nitrosylation of RyR1 lead to the dissociation of these stabilizing proteins, resulting in an increased open probability (Po), elevated Ca²⁺ spark frequency, and subsequent intracellular Ca²⁺ leak that contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and muscle weakness (Andersson et al., 2011). The proposed FKBP12.6-mimetic peptide, incorporating the FRLCLARK motif, is designed to dock onto the oxidized RyR1 in aged myotubes, functionally substituting for the lost or dissociated endogenous FKBP. By binding to the same regulatory sites on RyR1, the peptide is anticipated to stabilize the channel in a closed conformation and hence reduce pathological Ca²⁺ leak (Andersson et al., 2011; Marks, 2023). The mechanistic rationale is further supported by evidence from experimental models where compounds that enhance FKBP binding to RyR1—such as Rycal S107—were able to restore Ca²⁺ homeostasis, enhance Ca²⁺ transient amplitude, and improve muscle force generation (Santulli & Marks, 2015; Dong & Maturana, 2025). In addition, biochemical studies have elucidated that the molecular interactions between FKBPs and RyR channels involve a delicate allosteric modulation of channel gating, where proper FKBP occupancy ensures minimal baseline leak while permitting normal channel opening during excitation (Richardson et al., 2025; Lee et al., 2014). Therefore, replacing the natural stabilizing proteins with a peptide mimetic is predicted to restore the RyR1 conformation that minimizes leak through finely tuned inter-domain interactions (Andersson et al., 2011). Moreover, recent high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy studies have shed light on the binding interfaces of RyR channels with FKBP proteins, elucidating the potential docking sites that a mimetic peptide like FRLCLARK could target (Marks, 2023).

Expected Effect:
In the context of aged human myotubes—a cellular model of sarcopenia—the administration of a cell-penetrating version of the FKBP12.6-mimetic peptide is expected to have multiple beneficial effects. Primarily, by binding to oxidized RyR1 channels, the peptide is anticipated to restore the channel’s closed state at rest, thereby reducing the pathological Ca²⁺ leak that underlies disrupted calcium homeostasis in aging muscle (Andersson et al., 2011; Dong & Maturana, 2025). With reduced leak, the amplitude and stability of Ca²⁺ transients during muscle contractions are expected to improve, leading to enhanced excitation–contraction coupling and better force generation. This improvement in calcium handling is projected to have downstream effects on muscle cell metabolism and mitochondrial function; reduced Ca²⁺ leak is associated with decreased mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overload, lower production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and improved mitochondrial membrane potential, all of which are critical parameters in sustaining muscle health and function (Andersson et al., 2011; Michelucci et al., 2021). Additionally, restoring controlled Ca²⁺ transients can activate anabolic signaling pathways, such as mTORC1, which underlie protein synthesis and muscle maintenance—a pathway that has been shown to be beneficial in responding to low-dose rapamycin-like interventions that modulate FKBP interactions (Lee et al., 2014). Since FKBP12 and its stabilization of RyR1 have been genetically validated in RyR1 leak models (Andersson et al., 2011), it follows that the synthetic replacement with an FKBP12.6-mimetic peptide is likely to recapitulate these effects, resulting in improved muscle contractility, reduced fatigue, and mitigation of sarcopenia-associated muscle wasting. Importantly, the gene expression of RyR1 in skeletal muscle has been consistently confirmed, ensuring that the proposed target is relevant to the cell type under investigation (Marks, 2023; Michelucci et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
The FKBP12.6-mimetic peptide candidate based on the FRLCLARK sequence offers a novel and promising therapeutic approach for sarcopenia. One of its primary strengths lies in its targeted mechanism: by directly binding to oxidized RyR1 channels, the peptide has the potential to restore the physiological closed state of the channel, thereby reducing pathological Ca²⁺ leak that underlies much of the muscle weakness observed in aged muscle tissues (Andersson et al., 2011; Marks, 2023). This mechanism is supported by extensive preclinical research that has validated the role of calstabin (FKBP) dissociation in the etiology of RyR1-mediated muscle dysfunction in aging and disease (Santulli & Marks, 2015; Dong & Maturana, 2025). By emulating the action of FKBP12 or FKBP12.6, the peptide may combine the beneficial effects observed with Rycal compounds and FKBP ligands while offering improved specificity due to its peptide nature and design. Furthermore, the cell-penetrating formulation can ensure intracellular target engagement, which is paramount given that the target, RyR1, is located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum of myotubes (Lee et al., 2014; Andersson et al., 2011).

However, there are several challenges and weaknesses associated with this therapeutic candidate. First, while the biochemical rationale for replacing endogenous FKBP binding with a synthetic mimetic is strong, the in vivo pharmacokinetics and stability of such peptides can be problematic; peptides are typically susceptible to proteolytic degradation and may require chemical modifications or delivery systems to extend their half-life and ensure effective cellular uptake (Marks, 2023; Dong & Maturana, 2025). Additionally, the dynamic regulation of RyR1 by endogenous FKBP proteins is complex and context-dependent, with studies showing that partial FKBP occupancy can have biphasic effects on channel function (Richardson et al., 2025; Lee et al., 2014). This suggests that over-stabilization of RyR1 may inadvertently dampen necessary Ca²⁺ release events during muscle contraction, potentially leading to impaired excitation–contraction coupling if the dosing is not carefully calibrated. Moreover, while small molecule Rycals such as S107 have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models of muscle dysfunction, the translation of these effects to peptide mimetics remains to be conclusively demonstrated in rigorous in vivo studies (Andersson et al., 2011; Michelucci et al., 2021).

Another potential weakness is that the preclinical validation of FKBP12.6-mimetic peptides has mostly been confined to in vitro studies and animal models, with no current clinical trial record that directly addresses their efficacy in sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This gap in clinical research requires careful consideration during drug development because the complex interplay among oxidative modifications, mitochondrial dysfunction, and calcium handling in aged muscle may pose clinical challenges not fully recapitulated in preclinical models (Andersson et al., 2011; Meyer et al., 2021). Additionally, the potential immunogenicity of synthetic peptides must be thoroughly evaluated, as off-target immune responses could compromise both efficacy and safety.

Despite these challenges, the overall evaluation of the FKBP12.6-mimetic peptide candidate is promising. The rationale is strongly supported by a wide range of studies that have documented the detrimental effects of RyR1 Ca²⁺ leak in muscle aging and the benefits of restoring normal RyR1 function via enhanced FKBP binding (Andersson et al., 2011; Marks, 2023; Michelucci et al., 2021). The proposed mechanism—that the peptide docks to oxidized RyR1, replacing endogenous FKBP, reducing aberrant Ca²⁺ leak, and thereby stabilizing Ca²⁺ transients—addresses a fundamental pathological process in sarcopenia. The strategy also has the potential to synergize with other interventions that target mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, which are also hallmarks of aged muscle (Santulli & Marks, 2015; Dong & Maturana, 2025). In addition, the specificity of peptide–protein interactions may offer a higher degree of targeted efficacy with reduced systemic side effects compared to broader acting small molecule antioxidants or mTOR inhibitors (Lee et al., 2014; Andersson et al., 2011).

In conclusion, the FKBP12.6-mimetic peptide candidate based on the FRLCLARK sequence represents an innovative and mechanistically sound therapeutic approach for sarcopenia. Its strengths lie in its targeted molecular mechanism of action and the extensive preclinical evidence supporting the central role of RyR1 stabilization in mitigating Ca²⁺ leak and muscle weakness (Andersson et al., 2011; Marks, 2023). However, further work is needed to address the challenges of peptide delivery, stability, dosing precision, and in vivo validation in human-relevant models. Overall, this candidate is highly promising and merits continued investment in preclinical development and eventual early-phase clinical trials to investigate its efficacy and safety for treating sarcopenia (Kreko-Pierce et al., 2016; Dong & Maturana, 2025).
