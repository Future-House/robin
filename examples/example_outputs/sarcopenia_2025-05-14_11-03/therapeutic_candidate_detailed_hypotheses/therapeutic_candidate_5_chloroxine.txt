Proposal for Chloroxine (Sigma-Aldrich C-9878)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Chloroxine, identified as Sigma-Aldrich C-9878, is a chlorinated hydroxyquinoline originally developed and utilized for its antimicrobial properties and belongs to the quinoline derivative class of compounds (Rebbeck et al., 2020). This chemical entity was originally synthesized for antibacterial applications, leveraging the inherent bioactivity of its quinoline core, which confers favorable pharmacokinetic properties including good tissue distribution and high oral bioavailability, attributes that have historically made quinoline derivatives useful as both anti‐infectives and, in some instances, modulators of other cellular processes (Rebbeck et al., 2020). Historically, the quinoline scaffold has been the subject of extensive medicinal chemistry efforts, with repurposing strategies increasingly being employed to explore its applications beyond antibacterial activity; in the context of muscle disorders, the novelty of chloroxine lies in its potential to modulate intracellular calcium handling by targeting protein–protein interactions, specifically the calmodulin (CaM)–RyR1 interface (Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023). The identification of chloroxine as a promising candidate emerged from secondary high-throughput screening approaches, notably using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assays designed to detect alterations in the binding dynamics of regulatory proteins around RyR1 (Rebbeck et al., 2020), and its quinoline core is considered to be a chemically versatile moiety that has been explored in a range of therapeutic contexts.

Therapeutic History:
Chloroxine’s primary historical use has been as an antibacterial agent with a well-documented safety profile for treating infections, but there is currently no evidence that it has been used clinically for treating sarcopenia or similar muscle degenerative diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Preclinical studies and secondary screening campaigns, such as those reported by Rebbeck et al. (2020), have demonstrated that compounds from the quinoline family, including chloroxine, can interact with components of the excitation–contraction coupling machinery, particularly by modulating RyR1 function, although these compounds have not yet been translated into clinical therapeutics for muscle weakness disorders (Rebbeck et al., 2020). In addition, the repurposing strategy for chloroxine is further supported by the broader trend in drug development to exploit compounds with known pharmacological profiles in novel therapeutic applications such as neuromuscular diseases and sarcopenia, where dysregulated calcium homeostasis is a key pathogenic mechanism (Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023). Nonetheless, while there is an emerging body of biochemical data supporting the role of quinoline derivatives in modulating RyR1-mediated Ca²⁺ leak in skeletal muscle fibers, there remains a notable gap in clinical literature directly linking chloroxine to benefits in sarcopenia or other age-associated muscle atrophies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanistic hypothesis for chloroxine in the context of sarcopenia is that it binds to the RyR1 calmodulin-interaction domain in aged myotubes, thereby enhancing and stabilizing the association of calmodulin with RyR1 (Rebbeck et al., 2020). At the molecular level, RyR1 is a critical calcium release channel in skeletal muscle, and its normal gating behavior is tightly regulated by accessory proteins including calmodulin and FKBP12 that stabilize the closed state of the channel under resting conditions (Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023). In diseased or aged muscle, disruptions in the calmodulin–RyR1 interaction can lead to pathological calcium leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), contributing to muscle weakness by impairing the amplitude and fidelity of Ca²⁺ transients during excitation–contraction (EC) coupling (Rebbeck et al., 2020). Structural insights obtained via cryo-electron microscopy and high-throughput screening approaches have underscored that FRET signal changes directly correlate with alterations in the calmodulin association with RyR1, suggesting that compounds which enhance calmodulin binding can effectively reduce pathological SR Ca²⁺ leak (Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023; Rebbeck et al., 2020). The biochemical rationale is that the quinoline structure of chloroxine may interact with the calmodulin-binding pocket of RyR1, either allosterically altering the conformation of the channel or directly stabilizing the binding of calmodulin, thereby reducing aberrant Ca²⁺ efflux from the SR and restoring calcium signaling fidelity necessary for proper muscle contraction (Rebbeck et al., 2020). Such a mechanism is distinct from broad channel pore blockers like tetracaine or dantrolene because it targets the regulatory protein–protein interface rather than the pore itself, potentially offering better specificity and fewer side effects by preserving normal excitation–contraction coupling (Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023; Rebbeck et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the experimental settings proposed by our research team, chloroxine is expected to exert a measurable reduction in SR Ca²⁺ leak in aged myotubes and skinned muscle fibers by enhancing the CaM–RyR1 interaction, which in turn should restore the amplitude and fidelity of Ca²⁺ transients during both basal and stimulated conditions (Rebbeck et al., 2020). Specifically, by binding to the RyR1 calmodulin-interaction domain, chloroxine is hypothesized to increase FRET efficiency in assays that monitor the binding of calmodulin to RyR1, which has been correlated with a concurrent decrease in [³H]ryanodine binding, a biochemical marker for channel open probability and Ca²⁺ leak (Rebbeck et al., 2020). In physiological terms, this stabilization is anticipated to lead to a reduction in pathological Ca²⁺ leak during the resting state of skeletal muscle while preserving the robust Ca²⁺ release required for effective excitation–contraction coupling during muscle activity (Rebbeck et al., 2020). Given that RyR1 is the predominant calcium channel in skeletal muscle fibers and is critically involved in the generation of Ca²⁺ transients, increasing calmodulin’s association with RyR1 by chloroxine is expected to normalize altered calcium homeostasis, thereby improving muscle contractile function and potentially ameliorating sarcopenia-related muscle weakness (Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023; Rebbeck et al., 2020). This effect would be particularly significant in aged muscle, where disruptions in calcium handling contribute to decreased force production, increased fatigue, and overall muscle atrophy.

Overall Evaluation:
Chloroxine represents an innovative therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia by reengineering a well-known antibacterial agent into a modulator of skeletal muscle calcium signaling. One of the key strengths of chloroxine lies in its favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including oral bioavailability and extensive tissue distribution afforded by its quinoline core, which have been well characterized in its historical use as an antimicrobial (Rebbeck et al., 2020). Its mechanism of action, as proposed by the current hypothesis, is particularly appealing because it focuses on the stabilization of the calmodulin–RyR1 interaction rather than directly blocking the channel pore; this level of mechanistic specificity could translate into effective suppression of pathological Ca²⁺ leak with minimal disruption of normal excitation–contraction processes (Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023; Rebbeck et al., 2020). Preclinical data derived from FRET-based high-throughput screening and functional assays on skinned skeletal muscle fibers support the potential of chloroxine to lower Ca²⁺ leak and modulate RyR1 activity, thereby addressing one of the central pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to muscle weakness in sarcopenia (Rebbeck et al., 2020).

However, several weaknesses and uncertainties remain. First, although the underlying hypothesis is well supported by preclinical screenings, there is a lack of direct clinical or extensive preclinical data demonstrating chloroxine’s efficacy in treating sarcopenia or related muscle disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Moreover, while the repurposing strategy benefits from an established safety profile in its antibacterial role, the off-target effects that could arise from its action on RyR1 and the potential for undesired interference in other tissues expressing ryanodine receptors (for example, cardiac muscle where RyR2 predominates) must be thoroughly evaluated (Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023; Rebbeck et al., 2020). There is also emerging evidence suggesting that modulation of RyR1 by similar compounds can yield complex outcomes, and data reported in some non-muscle cell lines have shown inconsistent effects of chloroxine, likely related to differences in regulatory protein expression and the absence of a fully functional excitation–contraction coupling apparatus (Beaufils et al., 2022). Additionally, while the FRET assay data and [³H]ryanodine binding studies provide compelling mechanistic insights, confirmation in physiologically relevant models of aged muscle remains essential to bridge the gap between in vitro screening and in vivo efficacy (Rebbeck et al., 2020).

In summary, the overall potential of chloroxine as a therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia is promising but remains in an early stage of validation. Its strengths lie in the novel mechanism of action targeting the calmodulin–RyR1 interaction, the repurposing of a compound with favorable pharmacokinetics, and supportive preclinical screening data that indicate its ability to reduce pathological Ca²⁺ leak in skeletal muscle fibers. However, the weaknesses include the absence of direct clinical evidence in the context of sarcopenia, the possibility of off-target effects, and the need for further research to elucidate detailed molecular interactions and confirm its efficacy in age-related muscle dysfunction models. Based on the current comprehensive literature review spanning biochemical, clinical, and preclinical domains, chloroxine merits further targeted investigation using rigorous in vitro and in vivo models to validate its mechanism and therapeutic effect for potential repurposing as a treatment for sarcopenia (Rebbeck et al., 2020; Matsukawa & Murayama, 2023).
