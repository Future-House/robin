Proposal for CDN1163 (CAS 1088261-38-9)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
CDN1163 is a fully synthetic small-molecule compound identified as an allosteric activator of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase (SERCA) pump, specifically targeting the SERCA1 and SERCA2 isoforms known to be essential in skeletal muscle calcium handling (Qaisar et al., 2019). Discovered through high-throughput screening efforts in preclinical models of metabolic dysfunction and oxidative stress, CDN1163 is synthesized using organic chemistry methods that yield a molecule capable of penetrating cell membranes and selectively binding to SERCA (Qaisar et al., 2019). This compound belongs to a class of SERCA activators—small molecules designed to bind allosterically to the enzyme, thereby enhancing its Ca²⁺ affinity and ATPase activity, and ultimately improving the rate of calcium uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Qaisar et al., 2019). Members of this therapeutic class have previously been used in preclinical studies addressing muscle dysfunction and metabolic disorders, although their use in human clinical settings remains to be explored (Xu & Van Remmen, 2021).

Therapeutic History:
To date, the therapeutic history of CDN1163 is grounded entirely in rigorous preclinical evaluation. Extensive studies in animal models have demonstrated that SERCA activity is reduced in the context of muscle aging and oxidative stress, driving increased cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentrations and contributing to muscle atrophy and weakness (Paez et al., 2023). In models of oxidative stress-induced muscle impairment, such as the Sod1⁻/⁻ mouse, treatment with CDN1163 restored SERCA ATPase activity, reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, and rescued deficits in muscle mass and contractile force (Qaisar et al., 2019). Further extension of these findings in aged wild-type mice confirmed that chronic administration of CDN1163 prevents the decline in SERCA function typically observed during aging, leading to improved calcium homeostasis and muscle performance (Qaisar et al., 2020). Despite these promising preclinical outcomes, there are presently no clinical trials registered that test CDN1163 specifically for sarcopenia or muscle aging, which emphasizes that its current use is still confined to laboratory-based or animal model studies (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, CDN1163 functions by directly binding to SERCA, the enzyme responsible for re-uptake of Ca²⁺ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), thereby restoring effective Ca²⁺ cycling within the muscle cell (Qaisar et al., 2019). Under optimal conditions, SERCA activity is essential for promoting muscle relaxation following contraction by reducing cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentrations; however, in aged or diseased muscle, oxidative damage and altered expression of regulatory proteins impair SERCA function (Paez et al., 2023). CDN1163 is proposed to stabilize an active conformation of the SERCA pump, which increases its affinity for Ca²⁺ and enhances its ATPase activity, thereby accelerating the reuptake of Ca²⁺ into the SR (Qaisar et al., 2020; Li et al., 2025). This allosteric activation mechanism is particularly important because it does not merely upregulate SERCA expression but restores and augments the intrinsic enzymatic function of the existing protein, offering a more targeted approach than interventions such as antioxidants that broadly mitigate oxidative stress (Qaisar et al., 2019; Xu & Van Remmen, 2021). Moreover, by reducing the prolonged cytosolic calcium levels seen in aged muscle, CDN1163 indirectly decreases activation of Ca²⁺-dependent proteases and limits mitochondrial dysfunction—both critical contributors to muscle fatigue and atrophy in sarcopenia (Paez et al., 2023; Li et al., 2025).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis underlying the use of CDN1163 for sarcopenia is that by selectively binding and stabilizing SERCA1/2 ATPase in aged human myotubes, the drug will effectively boost the uptake of Ca²⁺ into the SR, thus normalizing intracellular Ca²⁺ levels, and restoring the amplitude and kinetics of Ca²⁺ transients that are typically impaired in sarcopenia (Qaisar et al., 2019; Paez et al., 2023). In the proposed assay, aged myotubes in vitro would be treated with CDN1163 to measure increases in SERCA ATPase activity, improved rate of calcium reuptake, reduction in the sustained elevated cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels, and normalization of muscle contraction–relaxation cycles. This is supported by preclinical evidence wherein CDN1163 treatment of aged or oxidative stress–modeled muscle resulted in enhanced contractile function and improved mitochondrial biogenesis markers, suggesting that muscle fibers restored to normative calcium dynamics exhibit enhanced force generation and endurance (Qaisar et al., 2019; Qaisar et al., 2020). The expected cellular outcome is a direct amelioration of the pathological prolonged Ca²⁺ transients exhibited by sarcopenic muscle, due to improved SERCA pump function. Additionally, since SERCA is known to be highly expressed in both fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers and plays a pivotal role in excitation–contraction coupling, its activation is expected to result in broad improvements in muscle fiber performance in the context of aging (Kanazawa et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025).

Overall Evaluation:
CDN1163 represents a compelling therapeutic candidate for the treatment of sarcopenia based on a robust preclinical rationale. Its primary strength lies in its mechanism of directly enhancing SERCA activity, which is a critical failure point in the pathogenesis of muscle aging. The preclinical studies conducted in Sod1⁻/⁻ mice and aged wild-type mouse models provide strong evidence that pharmacologically activating SERCA can restore calcium homeostasis, reduce oxidative stress, and importantly, improve muscle mass and contractile function (Qaisar et al., 2019; Qaisar et al., 2020). Additionally, the small-molecule nature of CDN1163 endows it with favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including cell permeability and low off-target effects, as demonstrated by its selectivity across a 160-target panel (Qaisar et al., 2019; Braun et al., 2021).

From a biochemical perspective, CDN1163’s well-defined mode of action—binding to and allosterically activating SERCA—provides a degree of mechanistic specificity that is often lacking in broader therapeutic approaches such as antioxidant supplementation (Qaisar et al., 2020; Li et al., 2025). Its action is particularly attractive because it directly addresses the known failure of Ca²⁺ reuptake seen in aged muscle, which underpins many of the downstream pathological effects including elevated cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels, increased protease activity, and mitochondrial dysfunction (Paez et al., 2023; Xu & Van Remmen, 2021).

However, there remain several weaknesses and gaps that need further exploration before CDN1163 can be confidently advanced as a therapeutic for sarcopenia. Firstly, while preclinical models have provided promising data, there is a complete absence of clinical trial evidence (ClinicalTrials.gov) indicating that the safety, optimal dosing, and long-term efficacy in humans are yet to be determined. Additionally, the detailed molecular interactions of CDN1163 with SERCA at the atomic level remain to be fully elucidated, which could be critical for optimizing its efficacy and reducing potential off-target effects (Li et al., 2025; Qaisar et al., 2019). Moreover, as the compound is primarily evaluated in animal models—specifically in mice with genetic and induced models of oxidative stress—the translatability of these findings to human physiology, particularly in the heterogeneous context of aging human muscle, must be validated with caution (Kanazawa et al., 2024; Paez et al., 2023).

The expected effect in human myotubes, as hypothesized, aligns well with the available biochemical and preclinical data, but additional studies involving human cell models and eventually early phase clinical trials will be necessary to confirm that the restoration of SERCA activity by CDN1163 similarly improves muscle function and calcium homeostasis in human sarcopenia (Qaisar et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2022). In terms of drug development, CDN1163 is appealing due to its druggable target—the SERCA pump—and the strong rationale provided by genetic studies that have implicated SERCA dysfunction in sarcopenia (Paez et al., 2023; Li et al., 2025). Its small-molecule nature also increases the likelihood of favorable pharmacokinetics and scalability in synthesis. Nonetheless, issues such as the potential for unforeseen adverse effects when systemically modulating calcium homeostasis, the precise impact on differing muscle fiber types, and the compound’s metabolic stability in humans all remain open questions, necessitating further in-depth investigation.

Overall, CDM1163 stands out as a promising drug candidate for repurposing in the treatment of sarcopenia. The strengths include a well-defined mechanism of action that directly targets a critical pathophysiological defect in aged muscle, robust preclinical data supporting its efficacy in restoring SERCA function and improving muscle performance, and the theoretical benefits of its small-molecule attributes, including cell permeability and specificity (Qaisar et al., 2019; Qaisar et al., 2020). On the other hand, the major weaknesses are the current lack of clinical trial data specifically in human sarcopenia, incomplete molecular characterization of its binding interactions, and the challenges inherent in translating preclinical animal data to diverse human populations (ClinicalTrials.gov; Qaisar et al., 2020).

In conclusion, based on the comprehensive literature review across biochemical, preclinical, and limited clinical data, CDN1163 demonstrates considerable promise as a therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia. Its ability to selectively activate SERCA, thereby restoring calcium homeostasis and improving muscle contractility, directly addresses the molecular defects associated with age-related muscle atrophy. While the preclinical evidence is compelling and the mechanistic rationale is strong, further studies—especially those involving human-derived cells and early-phase clinical trials—are essential to confirm its safety, optimal dosing, and translational efficacy in the context of sarcopenia. The strengths of this candidate make it worthy of continued development, whereas the weaknesses highlight the need for diligent translational research moving forward (Qaisar et al., 2019; Qaisar et al., 2020; Paez et al., 2023).
