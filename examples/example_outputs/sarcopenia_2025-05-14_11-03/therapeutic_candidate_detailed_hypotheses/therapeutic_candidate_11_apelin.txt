Proposal for Apelin-13 analog (Aib2-Apelin-13)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Aib2‐Apelin‐13 is a chemically modified derivative of apelin‐13, an endogenous peptide that naturally binds the apelin receptor (APJ/APLNR), a G protein‐coupled receptor (GPCR) widely expressed in cardiovascular and skeletal muscle tissues. Apelin peptides are originally derived from a 77–amino acid preproapelin precursor that is enzymatically cleaved into several bioactive fragments (e.g., apelin‐36, apelin‐17, apelin‐13) with the shorter isoforms often demonstrating higher receptor binding potency. Aib2‐Apelin‐13 falls into the class of peptide receptor agonists and is specifically designed with an amino acid substitution, incorporating an alpha‐aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) at position 2. This substitution is intended to create a proteolysis‐resistant analog that resists rapid enzymatic degradation, thereby extending its circulating half‐life and ensuring sustained receptor activation in vivo. The synthetic origins of Aib2‐Apelin‐13 involve solid‐phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc chemistry, followed by purification via HPLC and verification through mass spectrometry to ensure a purity greater than 95% (Cecconi et al., 2022, pp. 4–5). This class of compounds – proteolysis‐resistant peptide analogs – has been explored in various contexts, particularly in cardiovascular and metabolic applications, where modifications to native peptides have been used to overcome physiological limitations such as short half‐life and rapid receptor desensitization (Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 1–6; Vinel et al., 2018, pp. 1–5).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, the apelin/APJ receptor system has been investigated extensively for its roles in cardiovascular regulation, energy metabolism, and muscle physiology. Early studies highlighted that apelin peptide administration improves cardiac contractility and lowers blood pressure, outcomes that have spurred interest in its potential utility in heart failure (Parikh et al., 2018, pp. 1–3; Pisarenko et al., 2015, pp. 1–4). In recent years, emerging research has extended these findings to muscle physiology, with experimental evidence suggesting that the natural apelin peptide declines with age and that its deficiency contributes to sarcopenia – the age‐associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and function (Vinel et al., 2018, pp. 1–5; Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 17–19). Preclinical studies, especially those utilizing murine models of muscle atrophy such as cancer cachexia, have shown that exogenous administration of apelin peptides can mitigate muscle proteolysis and improve muscle fiber cross‐sectional area (Cecconi et al., 2022, pp. 7–10). Although direct clinical trials in sarcopenia populations with apelin receptor agonists are still scarce, several clinical trials have evaluated the vascular effects of apelin peptides in humans (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), and emerging therapeutic strategies for conditions like diabetes and heart failure have included investigation of these compounds (Najm et al., 2024, pp. 6–7). Therefore, while Aib2‐Apelin‐13 itself is novel, its pharmacological class has a documented history in both cardiovascular and metabolic systems, and recent preclinical evidence strongly suggests its potential for repurposing in sarcopenia.

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism by which Aib2‐Apelin‐13 is hypothesized to work involves targeting the APJ receptor on skeletal muscle cells to restore impaired intracellular calcium handling that is a hallmark of aged myotubes. Under normal conditions, activation of the APJ receptor – which couples primarily to Gq/11 proteins – stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) activity leading to the generation of inositol 1,4,5‐trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 subsequently binds to its receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), triggering Ca²⁺ release into the cytoplasm. This surging Ca²⁺ is then partially taken up by mitochondria through specialized ER–mitochondrial contact sites, thereby enhancing ATP production necessary for muscle contraction and sustaining excitation–contraction coupling (Read, 2019, pp. 213–217; Bae et al., 2019, pp. 9–10). Aging is associated with a decline in apelin expression and a concomitant reduction in IP3-mediated SR Ca²⁺ release and mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, contributing to blunted calcium transients and impaired bioenergetics in muscle fibers (Zhou et al., 2018, pp. 1–2; Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 19–22). Aib2‐Apelin‐13, by virtue of its enhanced stability from proteolytic resistance, is able to bind and activate the APJ receptor for an extended period. This sustained receptor engagement is posited to restore normal IP3 generation, amplify SR Ca²⁺ release, and consequently improve mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake. Improved mitochondrial calcium load is critical for the activation of dehydrogenase enzymes in the Krebs cycle, thereby boosting ATP synthesis and improving muscle contractility (Bae et al., 2019, pp. 1–2; Enoki et al., 2023, pp. 11–12). Additionally, APJ receptor activation through stable agonists like Aib2‐Apelin‐13 has downstream effects on anabolic signaling pathways, including increased phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR effectors (Cecconi et al., 2022, pp. 16–17; Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 11–14). These pathways not only promote protein synthesis in muscle cells but also inhibit proteolysis by downregulating the activity of muscle‐specific ubiquitin ligases such as MuRF1. The combined effect of enhanced calcium handling and anabolic signaling is expected to preserve muscle fiber size and contractile function in the aging population.

Expected Effect:
In the context of sarcopenia, the primary expected effect of Aib2‐Apelin‐13 would be the restoration of normal calcium transients in aged myotubes. Specifically, by enhancing IP3-mediated SR Ca²⁺ release coupled with efficient mitochondrial uptake, the drug candidate is expected to increase the amplitude of Ca²⁺ transients, thereby improving excitation–contraction coupling in skeletal muscle fibers. The activation of the APJ receptor and subsequent stimulation of downstream signaling pathways (e.g., AKT/mTOR) should also result in a reduction in proteolytic degradation and an increase in protein synthesis. This dual action not only supports mitochondrial bioenergetics – critical for ATP production during muscle contraction – but also contributes to maintaining muscle mass by preventing atrophy (Vinel et al., 2018, pp. 8–10; Cecconi et al., 2022, pp. 16–17). In vitro assays using aged myotubes are anticipated to demonstrate improved Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and more robust mitochondrial activity upon treatment with Aib2‐Apelin‐13. Furthermore, given that APJ receptor expression is maintained in skeletal muscle despite age-related declines in circulating apelin levels (Ochoa et al., 2023), direct receptor activation by a stabilized analog is likely to yield measurable improvements in muscle contractile function and may even ameliorate other aspects of muscle aging such as reduced endurance and strength (Najm et al., 2024, pp. 6–7; Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 17–19). The drug’s mechanism is also expected to have an anti-catabolic effect, decreasing the expression of atrophy markers (e.g., MuRF1) and promoting overall proteostasis in skeletal muscle tissue.

Overall Evaluation:
The evaluation of Aib2‐Apelin‐13 as a therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia is highly promising but not without certain challenges. One of the major strengths of this candidate lies in its rational design: by stabilizing a naturally occurring peptide through Aib substitution, it overcomes a key limitation of native apelin peptides – rapid proteolytic degradation and short plasma half-life – thereby ensuring more sustained activation of the APJ receptor (Cecconi et al., 2022, pp. 4–5; Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 11–14). This enhanced stability is critical because it allows for prolonged modulation of intracellular calcium dynamics, which is central to improving both the energetic profile and contractile function of aged muscle fibers. Mechanistically, the candidate addresses well‐validated pathogenic drivers of sarcopenia by restoring IP3-mediated SR Ca²⁺ release and facilitating mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake, which are essential for maintaining muscle bioenergetics and excitation–contraction coupling (Read, 2019, pp. 213–217; Bae et al., 2019, pp. 9–10).

Additional strengths include the potential downstream anabolic benefits mediated via AKT and mTOR signaling pathways. These benefits may contribute to preserving muscle mass beyond the acute improvements in contractile function, addressing both the functional and structural aspects of sarcopenia (Cecconi et al., 2022, pp. 16–17; Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 19–22). Moreover, preclinical studies have demonstrated the promise of apelin receptor agonists in reversing age‐related muscle atrophy and improving muscle function (Vinel et al., 2018, pp. 8–10; Najm et al., 2024, pp. 6–7).

However, there are challenges and potential weaknesses. One concern is that while the preclinical evidence is compelling, clinical translation remains to be firmly established since most studies to date have been conducted in animal models or in vitro settings. There is a need for robust clinical trials targeting sarcopenia to confirm efficacy and safety in the elderly human population (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, as observed in some cachectic models, high circulating apelin levels may sometimes lead to receptor desensitization or “apelin resistance” in muscle tissue. Although the use of a proteolysis-resistant analog is designed to overcome these hurdles, it will be critical to monitor receptor sensitivity and downstream signaling over longer treatment durations (Cecconi et al., 2022, pp. 7–10; Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 17–19).

Another consideration is the specificity of the drug’s action. While the activation of the APJ receptor appears to have beneficial effects on muscle contractility and energy metabolism, the APJ receptor is also expressed in other tissues such as the cardiovascular system and adipose tissue. It will therefore be essential to design dosing regimens and delivery methods that preferentially target skeletal muscle to minimize off-target effects. This may involve exploring local delivery strategies or modifying the pharmacokinetics to favor muscle uptake (Read, 2019, pp. 200–204; Enoki et al., 2023, pp. 10–11).

Overall, the mechanistic rationale supporting Aib2‐Apelin‐13’s action in enhancing IP3-mediated Ca²⁺ release and improving mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake is well grounded in current understanding of muscle physiology and the pathophysiology of sarcopenia (Zhou et al., 2018, pp. 1–2; Bae et al., 2019, pp. 9–10). Its design as a proteolysis-resistant analog directly addresses the issue of short peptide half-life that has historically limited the therapeutic utility of native apelin. Preclinical data provide encouraging evidence that modulation of the apelin/APJ axis can restore more youthful intracellular calcium signaling profiles, leading to improved energy production and contractile performance in aged myotubes (Vinel et al., 2018, pp. 8–10; Castan‐Laurell et al., 2019, pp. 19–22). In summary, while further work is needed to confirm clinical efficacy and optimize delivery, Aib2‐Apelin‐13 represents a promising and innovative therapeutic candidate for the treatment of sarcopenia, with a solid scientific rationale supported by biochemical, preclinical, and emerging clinical insights (Najm et al., 2024, pp. 6–7; Cecconi et al., 2022, pp. 16–17; Read, 2019, pp. 213–217).
