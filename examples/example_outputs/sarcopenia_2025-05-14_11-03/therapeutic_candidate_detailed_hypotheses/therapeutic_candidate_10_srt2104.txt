Proposal for SRT2104

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SRT2104 is a fully synthetic small‐molecule activator of SIRT1, a NAD⁺–dependent deacetylase enzyme that modulates many pathways associated with aging, metabolism, and inflammatory responses. This compound belongs to the class of sirtuin‐activating compounds (STACs), which have been designed as potent and selective pharmacological mimetics of caloric restriction. SRT2104 was discovered and optimized by Sirtris Pharmaceuticals (now part of GlaxoSmithKline) through high‐throughput screening and subsequent chemical modifications to improve oral bioavailability and selectivity relative to natural activators such as resveratrol. By design, STACs like SRT2104 were developed to be more druglike than early natural compounds; they offer improved pharmacokinetic profiles—with reasonable oral bioavailability, acceptable half‐life, and a safety profile established in multiple Phase I clinical trials—and the ability to activate SIRT1 at clinically relevant doses (Andreux et al., 2013; Hubbard & Sinclair, 2014; Chang et al., 2024). Moreover, SRT2104 is notable for its clear developmental pedigree: it has been studied not only in healthy volunteers but also in subjects with metabolic disorders and inflammatory conditions, thereby providing a rich preclinical and clinical evaluation background.

Therapeutic History:
SRT2104 has advanced considerably along the clinical development pathway. Early-phase clinical trials have evaluated this compound’s pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety in diverse human populations. In several Phase I studies—such as those registered under NCT00920660, NCT00937872, and NCT00938275—SRT2104 was administered to healthy adult volunteers both in fed and fasted states, and later in elderly populations (NCT00964340). These studies confirmed that SRT2104 is orally bioavailable, with peak plasma concentrations reached within approximately 1–3 hours; adverse events were generally mild (e.g., headache, gastrointestinal upset) and the safety profile was favorable across dose escalations up to 2.0 g daily (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008b; Libri et al., 2012; Mercken et al., 2014).
Furthermore, SRT2104 has been investigated in patients with type 2 diabetes (Baksi et al., 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2010a) and in inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2010b) and ulcerative colitis (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2012). In these clinical contexts, the compound demonstrated biochemical activity such as improved lipid profiles, reduction in inflammatory cytokines, and evidence of SIRT1 target engagement. Importantly for drug repurposing, none of the clinical studies thus far have specifically aimed at treating sarcopenia, yet the biochemical rationale providing indirect evidence from its use in metabolic and aging‐related conditions bolsters the hypothesis that SRT2104 may benefit muscle pathology. Preclinical studies have also indicated that SRT2104 can improve mitochondrial function in muscle tissue during conditions of stress such as disuse (Waltz et al., 2019; Wesolowski et al., 2023). Although direct application in sarcopenia models is still emerging, the wealth of clinical data on safety and pharmacokinetics gives SRT2104 a strong translational advantage for repurposing efforts in aged muscle disorder contexts.

Mechanism of Action:
At its core, SRT2104 functions by binding allosterically to SIRT1, thereby enhancing its deacetylase activity. SIRT1 deacetylates a wide range of substrates implicated in cellular stress responses and metabolic regulation, including transcription factors such as p53, FOXO family proteins, NF-κB, and coactivators such as PGC-1α. Activation of SIRT1 results in improved mitochondrial biogenesis and function via deacetylation and subsequent activation of PGC-1α, yielding increased expression of genes related to oxidative metabolism. This action underlies many of the systemic anti-inflammatory and metabolic benefits observed with SRT2104 (Andreux et al., 2013; Hubbard & Sinclair, 2014).

The novel hypothesis here postulates that SRT2104 may exert a direct impact on sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase isoforms—SERCA2a/2b—in aged myotubes by deacetylating them. In skeletal muscle, SERCA2 is critically involved in sequestering cytosolic Ca²⁺ back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) following contraction, ensuring effective muscle relaxation and refilling of Ca²⁺ stores. With aging, calcium handling tends to be impaired, and dysfunctional SERCA2 activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia by contributing to cytosolic Ca²⁺ overload and subsequent muscle weakness. While direct evidence from clinical trials showing SRT2104’s modulation of SERCA2 is not yet available, existing studies have demonstrated that SIRT1 activation can influence Ca²⁺ handling proteins, and related literature suggests that post-translational modifications such as acetylation can alter SERCA function (Guo et al., 2024; Hubbard & Sinclair, 2014). Thus, by deacetylating SERCA2, SRT2104 may restore proper SR Ca²⁺ uptake dynamics, normalize Ca²⁺ transient clearance, and ultimately mitigate the toxic effects of cytosolic Ca²⁺ overload in aged muscle fibers.

At the biochemical level, the binding of SRT2104 to SIRT1 stabilizes the enzyme’s conformation, lowering the Km for its acetylated substrates, which results in enhanced deacetylation reactions even at physiological NAD⁺ levels. This mechanism not only influences mitochondrial biogenesis but might also target specific muscle proteins such as SERCA2. The hypothesis that SIRT1 deacetylates and thereby modulates SERCA2 function is supported by recent mechanistic studies, suggesting that SIRT1 activation leads to protective modifications in intracellular calcium handling and may even improve energy efficiency in myocytes (Pardo & Boriek, 2011; Tonkin et al., 2012). Given that SERCA2 expression is maintained in skeletal muscle and its activity declines with age, improved regulation via deacetylation represents an attractive therapeutic target for sarcopenia (Pardo & Boriek, 2011; Tonkin et al., 2012).

Expected Effect:
The expected pharmacodynamic effect of SRT2104 in aged myotubes is multifaceted. By activating SIRT1, SRT2104 is anticipated to trigger deacetylation of SERCA2 isoforms, which should increase the activity of SERCA2, leading to accelerated SR Ca²⁺ uptake. Enhanced Ca²⁺ uptake into the SR would provide a more rapid clearance of cytosolic Ca²⁺ transients after muscle contraction, reducing the likelihood of cytosolic Ca²⁺ overload—a condition associated with impaired muscle relaxation, increased cellular stress, and eventual muscle atrophy. In this context, the improved calcium homeostasis would be expected to result in a concomitant enhancement in muscle contractile function and endurance, hallmark improvements that directly target the biochemical underpinnings of sarcopenic weakness (Chen et al., 2023; Mercken et al., 2014).

In addition, by enhancing SIRT1 activity, SRT2104 may also promote mitochondrial biogenesis and improve mitochondrial efficiency through activation of PGC-1α, which is well documented to support energy metabolism in skeletal muscle. The dual action—improving both calcium handling through potential deacetylation of SERCA2 and augmenting mitochondrial function—creates a promising therapeutic approach in sarcopenia, given the disease’s complex etiology which involves both metabolic insufficiency and poor Ca²⁺ regulation. The fact that SIRT1 is expressed in skeletal muscle and plays a central role in regulating muscle repair and adaptation to stress supports the rationale for using SRT2104 in this tissue type (Myers et al., 2019; Pardo & Boriek, 2011). Preclinical studies in animal models of muscle atrophy—for example, in hindlimb-unloaded rats—have shown that SIRT1 activators can preserve muscle mass and improve mitochondrial enzyme activities, which further underscores the expected beneficial effects in slowing or reversing sarcopenic decline (Waltz et al., 2019; Wesolowski et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, SRT2104 is a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in sarcopenia due to several notable strengths. First, its synthetic nature and optimized drug-like properties—such as oral bioavailability, predictable pharmacokinetics, and extensive safety data from multiple clinical trials in diverse populations—offer a strong translational advantage. Clinical studies have repeatedly confirmed that SRT2104 is well tolerated in both healthy and diseased subjects, which suggest that potential side effects are minimal and manageable (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2009c; Hubbard & Sinclair, 2014; Libri et al., 2012). Second, the historical use of SRT2104 in trials for metabolic and inflammatory conditions supports its role as a modulator of pathways that are also relevant in the aging muscle phenotype. The compound’s previously demonstrated capacity to improve lipid profiles, reduce inflammatory cytokines, and enhance mitochondrial biomarkers indirectly supports its potential efficacy in conditions like sarcopenia that involve similar pathophysiological processes (Baksi et al., 2014; Mercken et al., 2014).

On the mechanistic side, the activation of SIRT1 by SRT2104 is well established at the molecular level. There is substantial evidence that SIRT1 regulates pathways critical to muscle metabolism, including deacetylation of transcription factors that drive mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic adaptation. The hypothesis that SRT2104 may deacetylate SERCA2, thereby enhancing SR Ca²⁺ uptake and improving Ca²⁺ transient clearance, is mechanistically attractive even though direct evidence in muscle tissues is presently limited. If proven, this specific post-translational modification could present a distinct molecular advantage over more general antioxidant or anti-inflammatory interventions. The dual action of simultaneously improving mitochondrial function and calcium handling addresses two central etiological factors in sarcopenia—mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulated Ca²⁺ homeostasis (Guo et al., 2024; Hubbard & Sinclair, 2014).

However, several weaknesses remain. Despite promising preclinical data regarding SIRT1 activation and muscle function improvement, there is a lack of direct clinical or preclinical studies that specifically examine SERCA2 deacetylation by SRT2104 in aged muscle or sarcopenia models. Most clinical trials conducted so far with SRT2104 have focused on metabolic diseases, psoriasis, inflammation, or type 2 diabetes, with no dedicated evaluation of muscle-specific endpoints such as force production, endurance, or direct measurements of calcium handling (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; Chang et al., 2024). This gap in the research leaves uncertainty regarding the precise magnitude of the effect on SERCA2 and subsequent improvements in muscle function. Furthermore, while the broad mechanism of SIRT1 activation is well documented, the specificity of SRT2104’s action on muscle proteins and the optimal dosing regimen to achieve the proposed SERCA2 deacetylation in muscle cells remain to be determined. Variability in pharmacokinetics noted in some clinical trials may also present challenges in reaching consistent therapeutic exposures in older patients with sarcopenia (Baksi et al., 2014; Libri et al., 2012).

Another consideration is the complexity of sarcopenia as a multifactorial disease. Sarcopenia involves not only deficits in muscle mass and mitochondrial function but also impaired satellite cell activity, increased inflammatory milieu, and systemic hormonal alterations. Thus, while improving Ca²⁺ handling via SERCA2 modulation is attractive, the overall clinical benefit may require combination strategies or targeting additional surrogate markers to achieve significant functional improvements.

In conclusion, SRT2104 presents a strong candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic for sarcopenia due to its well-established pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, its potent activation of SIRT1, and the plausible mechanistic connections between SIRT1 activation, improved mitochondrial function, and potential enhancement of SERCA2 activity. These factors collectively support the hypothesis that SRT2104 could accelerate SR Ca²⁺ uptake and improve calcium transient clearance, thereby mitigating cytosolic Ca²⁺ overload—a key driver of sarcopenic weakness (Mercken et al., 2014; Radak et al., 2020; Tonkin et al., 2012). Nonetheless, the lack of direct evidence linking SRT2104 to SERCA2 deacetylation in muscle remains a critical gap that must be addressed with focused preclinical studies and eventually, targeted clinical trials in sarcopenic populations. Across all considerations, the strengths lie in SRT2104’s translational readiness and broad mechanism of action, whereas the weaknesses center on the need for more muscle-specific mechanistic validation and clinical efficacy data in sarcopenia. Overall, SRT2104 shows considerable promise and warrants further investigation in dedicated preclinical models of muscle aging and ultimately in clinical trials evaluating functional muscle endpoints in the elderly.
