Proposal for Spermidine

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Spermidine is a naturally occurring polyamine that is endogenously synthesized and ubiquitously present in all living cells. It is found at high concentrations in various plant‐derived foods such as soybeans, whole grains, and certain fruits, and it plays essential roles in cell proliferation, gene expression, and protein translation. As a member of the polyamine class, spermidine belongs to a group of small, aliphatic cations that have been extensively studied for their capacity to induce autophagy, modulate cellular stress responses, and extend lifespan in diverse experimental systems (Galasso et al., 2023). Polyamines, including spermidine, have traditionally been explored for their functions in stabilizing DNA and RNA, facilitating ribosome biogenesis, and protecting against oxidative stress; these properties have been exploited in various research settings to promote cellular homeostasis (Galasso et al., 2023). The discovery of spermidine’s autophagy‐inducing properties has repositioned it as a potential therapeutic nutraceutical for aging‐related diseases, with proof‐of‐concept studies demonstrating lifespan extension and cardioprotection in preclinical models (Eisenberg et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Spermidine’s therapeutic potential has been highlighted in a number of preclinical studies addressing aging and muscle function. Numerous studies in animal models, including mouse models of muscle dystrophy and aging, have shown that spermidine supplementation improves muscle mass, enhances mitochondrial function, and activates autophagic pathways, which in turn restores proper cellular metabolism and protein homeostasis (Fan et al., 2017; Chen & Wu, 2025). Clinical and epidemiological investigations have linked higher spermidine levels in whole blood with healthy aging and longevity, and several clinical trials have been initiated to assess its metabolic and autophagic effects in elderly subjects; for example, the trial NCT06186102 investigates polyamine treatment in elderly patients with coronary artery disease with secondary outcomes evaluating muscle characteristics, and NCT05459961 evaluates metabolic responses to spermidine supplementation in older men (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022). While direct clinical studies in sarcopenia are still emerging, the collective evidence from preclinical models of muscle aging and from endpoints relating to mitochondrial quality and autophagy markers in muscle strongly suggest that spermidine has promising potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for age-related muscle decline, including sarcopenia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Galasso et al., 2023). Moreover, prior work in animal models of muscle dystrophy and autophagy-deficient conditions such as collagen VI-related myopathy demonstrated that spermidine reactivates autophagy, improves muscle histopathology, and increases force generation, which indirectly supports its potential for conditions characterized by impaired muscle function like sarcopenia (Chrisam et al., 2015; Giourmas, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, spermidine exerts its beneficial effects primarily through the induction of autophagy, a key intracellular degradation pathway that recycles damaged proteins and organelles to maintain cellular homeostasis. Spermidine is known to inhibit the activity of acetyltransferases such as EP300, resulting in hypoacetylation of key autophagy modulators, thereby lifting the block on autophagic flux (Chrisam et al., 2015). This inhibition allows for the activation of the autophagy machinery, leading to the formation of autophagosomes and their subsequent fusion with lysosomes. In muscle cells, the activation of autophagy is particularly important for the removal of oxidatively damaged proteins and organelles; preclinical studies have demonstrated that spermidine supplementation increases markers of autophagosome formation such as lipidated LC3B (LC3B-II) and decreases the accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates (Fan et al., 2017; Chen & Wu, 2025).

The hypothesis under consideration proposes that in aged human myotubes, spermidine supplementation facilitates the autophagy-mediated turnover of oxidized calcium (Ca²⁺) handling proteins—specifically, the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) and the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA). RyR1 is a critical channel located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane that mediates Ca²⁺ release during excitation–contraction coupling, while SERCA is responsible for reuptaking Ca²⁺ back into the SR during muscle relaxation. Oxidative modifications of these proteins in aged muscle can lead to a pathological increase in SR Ca²⁺ leak and impaired reuptake kinetics, ultimately reducing Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and impairing contractile function (Chen & Wu, 2025).

Spermidine’s known mechanism—promoting autophagy—could theoretically support the clearance of these oxidized, dysfunctional proteins and facilitate their replacement with newly synthesized, functional proteins. Although direct evidence linking spermidine to enhanced turnover of oxidized RyR1 or SERCA in aged muscle is presently limited in the literature, several studies have shown that spermidine reactivates autophagy in muscle cells, which is critical for maintaining organellar quality and protein function (Galasso et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2017). Moreover, improved mitochondrial function and reduced apoptosis following spermidine supplementation further support enhanced cellular homeostasis that may indirectly restore proper Ca²⁺ handling (Iwata et al., 2025; Galasso et al., 2023).

In terms of biochemical specificity, spermidine is orally bioavailable and has a favorable safety profile in both preclinical and early clinical settings; its mechanism of inducing autophagy is more selective than broad antioxidant mechanisms because it targets the clearance of damaged protein aggregates rather than simply scavenging reactive oxygen species (Fan et al., 2017; Filfan et al., 2020). This specificity offers a mechanistically distinct route for restoring muscle Ca²⁺ homeostasis: by specifically enhancing autophagic clearance, spermidine may remove oxidatively modified RyR1 and SERCA, thereby reducing aberrant Ca²⁺ leak and improving SR Ca²⁺ reuptake kinetics, which are essential determinants of muscle contractile efficiency (Chen & Wu, 2025; Galasso et al., 2023).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, the expected effect of spermidine supplementation in aged human myotubes is twofold. First, by upregulating autophagic flux, spermidine is expected to accelerate the removal of oxidatively damaged and dysfunctional proteins, including RyR1 and SERCA. Second, the clearance of these oxidized proteins should lead to a restoration of proper Ca²⁺ handling dynamics within the muscle cells—specifically, a reduction in pathological SR Ca²⁺ leak and an improvement in reuptake kinetics at the SR: both of these improvements would culminate in a higher amplitude Ca²⁺ transient during muscle contraction (Chen & Wu, 2025; Fan et al., 2017).

In the proposed assay using aged human myotubes, one would anticipate observing the following outcomes: an increase in markers of autophagy (such as LC3B-II and decreased p62 levels), improved mitochondrial morphology and function, and, most importantly, a measurable improvement in Ca²⁺ transient parameters using calcium imaging techniques. The enhanced Ca²⁺ transient amplitude is hypothesized to correlate with increased contractile output, as precise Ca²⁺ handling is critical for the excitation–contraction cycle in skeletal muscle fibers (Galasso et al., 2023; Giourmas, 2021).

Proteomic studies in aged muscle have indicated that the expression of RyR1 and SERCA is maintained in human myotubes; however, their function becomes compromised due to oxidative modifications that alter their conformation and activity. Thus, a successful spermidine intervention would not necessarily increase the abundance of these proteins but would rather restore their function by facilitating the turnover of the oxidized pool (Chen & Wu, 2025; Galasso et al., 2023). Moreover, previous reports in animal models have shown that spermidine supplementation results in improved muscle force output and amelioration of myopathic defects, indirectly supporting the idea that enhanced autophagy can translate into better muscle contractility (Chrisam et al., 2015; Giourmas, 2021).

Expression analysis of Ca²⁺ handling proteins in myotubes confirms that RyR1 and SERCA are indeed expressed in these cells, and autophagy-related genes are upregulated in response to spermidine, indicating that the molecular machinery necessary for this therapeutic mechanism is present and potentially modifiable in aged human muscle cells (Galasso et al., 2023; Han et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, spermidine emerges as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of sarcopenia based on both its mechanistic rationale and supporting preclinical evidence. One of the major strengths of spermidine lies in its dual action: its autophagy-inducing capability has been robustly demonstrated in various preclinical models of muscle aging and myopathy, and its favorable safety profile and oral bioavailability make it an attractive candidate for human application (Galasso et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024). Its mechanistic specificity—in targeting the turnover of oxidized, malfunctioning proteins rather than broadly quenching reactive oxygen species—is particularly advantageous, as it allows for the selective restoration of function in critical components of the muscle contractile apparatus such as RyR1 and SERCA, which are known to be compromised in the aging process (Chen & Wu, 2025; Fan et al., 2017).

However, there are also notable challenges and weaknesses. Although the preclinical data in animal models are compelling and there is emerging evidence from humans regarding safety and metabolic effects, direct demonstration of spermidine’s ability to specifically enhance the turnover of oxidized Ca²⁺ handling proteins in aged human myotubes remains to be conclusively established. Most current studies have focused on general markers of autophagy and improvements in muscle histology and function without animal or human data directly linking spermidine to changes in RyR1 or SERCA function (Galasso et al., 2023; Chen & Wu, 2025). Additionally, while several clinical trials (e.g., NCT06186102) are evaluating the broader metabolic effects and autophagy induction by spermidine in aged patients, none have yet provided direct evidence for improved Ca²⁺ handling or increased contractility in skeletal muscle, which is the central premise of the current therapeutic hypothesis (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Another potential limitation is the translation of these cellular and animal model results to the clinical setting. Aging human muscle is influenced by a complex interplay of systemic factors including hormonal changes, chronic inflammation, and reduced regenerative capacity; hence, even significant improvements in autophagy might need to be complemented by other interventions to achieve robust clinical benefits in sarcopenia. Moreover, the dosing and long-term effects of spermidine supplementation require further optimization, as prior studies have indicated that high levels of spermidine may, in some contexts, induce excessive autophagy that could adversely affect muscle function (Chrisam et al., 2015).

In summary, the repurposing of spermidine as a therapeutic candidate for sarcopenia is supported by extensive preclinical evidence showing that it extends lifespan and improves muscle function by inducing autophagy. The proposed mechanism—that spermidine selectively clears oxidized RyR1 and SERCA, thereby restoring proper Ca²⁺ handling and enhancing contractile performance—is biologically plausible, given that autophagy is critically involved in the removal of dysfunctional proteins in aged muscle. Although direct evidence on the turnover of oxidized Ca²⁺ handling proteins by spermidine remains to be fully validated, the overall body of literature indicates significant potential for spermidine in mitigating muscle aging. Strengths of this approach include its natural origin, oral bioavailability, favorable safety profile, and a clearly defined mechanistic pathway for enhancing muscle quality. Weaknesses relate mainly to the current gap in direct evidence linking spermidine to improved Ca²⁺ handling at the molecular level in human myotubes and the need for further clinical studies to ascertain its efficacy specifically in sarcopenia. Nonetheless, based on the comprehensive review of biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature, spermidine represents a compelling candidate for further investigation as a therapeutic intervention for sarcopenia (Fan et al., 2017; Han et al., 2022; Galasso et al., 2023).
