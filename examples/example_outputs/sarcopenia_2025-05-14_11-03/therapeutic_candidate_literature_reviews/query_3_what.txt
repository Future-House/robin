Query: What published data exist on the efficacy and mechanism of action of small-molecule SERCA activators in aging skeletal muscle, including quantitative measurements of SR Ca²⁺ reuptake rates, improvements in twitch and tetanic force in ex vivo or in vivo sarcopenia models, and analyses of off-target effects or isoform specificity?

Published data indicate that small‐molecule SERCA activators—most notably CDN1163—can restore impaired SERCA ATPase function in aging skeletal muscle and thereby improve muscle performance. In oxidative stress models such as the Sod1–/– mouse, CDN1163 restored SERCA activity to levels that approximate those found in young, wild‐type muscle, with corresponding improvements in muscle mass and force generation. This effect is attributed mechanistically to enhanced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca²⁺ uptake, which reduces cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overload, limits reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and preserves downstream signaling pathways involved in muscle contraction and adaptation (qaisar2019restorationofserca pages 8-11).

With respect to quantitative assessments, assays using multiple calcium concentrations (pCa curves) have been employed to estimate SERCA ATPase activity. However, these studies did not report specific numeric values for SR Ca²⁺ reuptake kinetics; rather, they provide qualitative evidence that SERCA activity is normalized with treatment (qaisar2020restorationofsarcoplasmic pages 8-10). Regarding muscle contractility, ex vivo studies using isolated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles showed that aged mice experience a roughly 21% reduction in absolute contractile force and an 11% decline in specific force—deficits that were restored to youthful levels following CDN1163 treatment (qaisar2020restorationofsarcoplasmic pages 2-5). While these reports underscore substantial improvements in twitch and tetanic force generation with SERCA activation, they stop short of furnishing detailed kinetic profiles or explicit SR Ca²⁺ reuptake rate numbers.

On the subject of off-target effects and isoform specificity, available data reveal a favorable safety profile for CDN1163. Off-target screening involving 160 potential targets did not identify any significant adverse effects, and ancillary measurements showed no changes in other organ weights (e.g., kidney, liver, or brain) following treatment (qaisar2019restorationofserca pages 8-11). Additionally, genetic models that mimic SERCA activation—such as SERCA overexpression or sarcolipin deletion—support the notion that chronic activation does not yield deleterious effects. However, the studies do not provide a comprehensive analysis of isoform specificity. Although skeletal muscle expresses both SERCA1a and SERCA2a (with a predominance of these isoforms), explicit comparative data on the selectivity of CDN1163 for these isoforms are not detailed in the reviewed excerpts (qaisar2020restorationofsarcoplasmic pages 11-13, xu2021thesarcoendoplasmicreticulum pages 5-7).

In summary, the published data support that pharmacological activation of SERCA using small molecules like CDN1163 can significantly restore SERCA ATPase activity and improve muscle mass and force production in aging skeletal muscle. Nonetheless, while improvements in muscle performance (including twitch and tetanic force) are documented and functional benefits are correlated with improved Ca²⁺ handling and reduced oxidative stress, the literature does not yet provide detailed quantitative measurements of SR Ca²⁺ reuptake rates or a full characterization of isoform specificity and off‐target profiles. Further investigations with these specific quantitative analyses are therefore warranted (qaisar2019restorationofserca pages 11-13, qaisar2020restorationofsarcoplasmic pages 7-8).
