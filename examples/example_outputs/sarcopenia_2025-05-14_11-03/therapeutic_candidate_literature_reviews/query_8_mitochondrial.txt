Query: Mitochondrial calcium handling deficits in aging skeletal muscle: links between altered MCU/MCUR1 function, mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, reactive oxygen species production, bioenergetic failure, and sarcopenia phenotypes in human and rodent models

In skeletal muscle, mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+) uptake is critical for matching metabolic demand with energy production. The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, which includes the pore-forming MCU and regulatory subunits such as MCUR1, is essential for importing Ca2+ into the mitochondrial matrix. In aging skeletal muscle, altered expression or dysfunction of MCU and MCUR1 impairs this process, compromising the Ca2+-dependent activation of dehydrogenases that drive the tricarboxylic acid cycle and ATP synthesis (hutto2020ca2+handlingand pages 100-102, tarasova2019mitochondrialcalciumuniporter pages 1-3).

Deficits in MCU/MCUR1 function lead not only to diminished mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake but also to dysregulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics. With insufficient mitochondrial Ca2+ entry, the stimulus for metabolic fluxes is reduced, thereby lowering ATP production. This bioenergetic failure makes muscle cells less capable of meeting the energetic demands of contraction and repair, setting the stage for the muscle weakening observed in sarcopenia (michelucci2021alteredca2+handling pages 2-4, venkatachalam2022regulationofaging pages 6-8).

Furthermore, the reduced activity of MCU and MCUR1 contributes to an imbalance in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis that predisposes mitochondria to pathological events. When mitochondrial Ca2+ levels are not adequately buffered, even modest cytosolic Ca2+ signals can lead to excessive, localized Ca2+ accumulation. This overload triggers the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), a critical event that dissipates the mitochondrial membrane potential and disrupts oxidative phosphorylation (hutto2020ca2+handlingand pages 9-12, michelucci2021alteredca2+handling pages 9-11). The improper opening of mPTP not only compromises bioenergetics but also activates cell death pathways that exacerbate muscle tissue loss.

The opening of mPTP is tightly intertwined with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In normal conditions, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake helps regulate ROS production by optimizing electron transport chain function. However, when Ca2+ handling is impaired due to altered MCU/MCUR1 activity, electron flux becomes inefficient, leading to excess ROS generation. Elevated ROS levels further damage mitochondrial components and may modify and inactivate key proteins, including those of the MCU complex, thereby intensifying the cycle of mitochondrial dysfunction (hutto2020ca2+handlingand pages 5-9, michelucci2021alteredca2+handling pages 5-7).

In rodent and human models, evidence shows that these deficits in mitochondrial Ca2+ handling are closely linked with the pathological features of sarcopenia. Reduced MCU/MCUR1 function, by impairing mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, promotes chronic mPTP opening and heightened ROS production. These conditions lead to bioenergetic failure and initiate proteolytic pathways via calpains and caspase activation, resulting in muscle protein degradation and fiber atrophy (kurpisz2021theroleof pages 3-5, dubinin2023ionchannelsof pages 10-11).

Additionally, aging muscle exhibits altered subcellular architecture where the spatial coupling between mitochondria and Ca2+ release sites (sarcoplasmic reticulum microdomains) becomes less efficient. This uncoupling further limits the microdomain Ca2+ signals required for optimal mitochondrial uptake and exacerbates ROS production and apoptosis through persistent mPTP opening (michelucci2021alteredca2+handling pages 15-16, michelucci2021alteredca2+handling pages 16-18).

In summary, the convergence of altered MCU/MCUR1 function, increased mPTP opening, excessive ROS generation, and bioenergetic insufficiency underlies the development of sarcopenia in aging skeletal muscle. These interconnected mechanisms, as documented in both human and rodent models, highlight the critical role of mitochondrial Ca2+ handling in maintaining muscle cell integrity and function (tarasova2019mitochondrialcalciumuniporter pages 13-14, michelucci2021alteredca2+handling pages 4-5).
