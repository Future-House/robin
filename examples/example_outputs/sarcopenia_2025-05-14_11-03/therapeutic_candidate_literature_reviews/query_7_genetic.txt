Query: Genetic and functional evidence linking defective SERCA1/SERCA2 pump expression or regulatory proteins (phospholamban, sarcolipin) to muscle atrophy and sarcopenia: analyses of patient mutations, knockdown/overexpression models, rescue by small molecules in relevant myotube systems

There is robust genetic and functional evidence linking defects in SERCA1/SERCA2 expression and aberrant regulation by phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) to muscle atrophy and sarcopenia. Although integrated data sources such as the Open Targets Platform reveal no direct gene–disease associations for these targets (OpenTargets Search: muscle atrophy,sarcopenia-ATP2A1,ATP2A2,phospholamban,sarcolipin), the bulk of the literature using genetic models provides compelling support for a role of SERCA dysfunction in muscle pathology.

Patient mutation analyses are sparse. However, studies focused on genetic disorders such as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A) reveal that CAPN3 deficiency is associated with increased ubiquitination and degradation of SERCA proteins, resulting in impaired Ca²⁺ handling and muscle pathology. In affected individuals, CAPN3-deficient myotubes and patient biopsies show markedly reduced SERCA1 expression, linking defective SERCA stability directly to a genetic disease phenotype (toralojeda2016calpain3deficiency pages 11-12).

In knockdown and overexpression models, numerous reports directly demonstrate that altered expression of SERCA or its regulatory proteins has functional consequences for muscle health. For instance, shRNA-mediated knockdown of CAPN3 in both mouse and human myotubes results in significant reductions in SERCA1 and SERCA2 protein levels as well as RyR1, leading to impaired Ca²⁺ clearance and prolonged decay time constants in live-cell imaging assays (toralojeda2016calpain3deficiency pages 4-5). Similarly, transgenic overexpression of PLN in mouse skeletal muscle results in muscle weakness and remodeling that resemble centronuclear myopathies, implicating the inhibitory modulation of SERCA as a key mechanism underlying muscle dysfunction (fajardo2016theroleof pages 187-190).

Further elucidation comes from models investigating SLN. Overexpression of SLN, which normally decreases SERCA’s affinity for Ca²⁺, impairs contractile function and exacerbates muscle atrophy. In a particularly telling model, deletion of SLN in phospholamban-overexpressing mice further worsens soleus muscle atrophy and weakness, indicating a complex interplay between these regulatory proteins in maintaining proper SERCA function (fajardo2017sarcolipindeletionexacerbates pages 14-15). Complementarily, knockdown/overexpression studies in myotube systems have demonstrated that altered levels of these proteins directly correlate with defective Ca²⁺ transport and impaired muscle contractility, establishing a clear functional link (fajardo2017effectsofsarcolipin pages 18-21).

Rescue experiments form another critical pillar of evidence. Pharmacological interventions using small-molecule allosteric activators of SERCA, such as CDN1163, have demonstrated the capacity to restore SERCA activity in experimental settings. In multiple models of aging and dystrophy, treatment with such compounds prevented muscle atrophy and improved force-generating capacity by enhancing Ca²⁺ uptake, reducing oxidative stress, and ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction (qaisar2019restorationofserca pages 11-13). Similar approaches in aged muscle and oxidative stress models indicate that restoration of SERCA function through small molecules can reverse the impaired Ca²⁺ handling that underpins sarcopenia (qaisar2020restorationofsarcoplasmic pages 1-2).

Mechanistically, oxidative modifications have been shown to diminish SERCA activity. Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aged tissues lead to irreversible oxidation of key SERCA cysteine residues, further compromising calcium homeostasis. This oxidative inactivation is compounded by increased levels of inhibitory proteins such as PLN post-denervation, which further depress SERCA activity and contribute to the atrophic phenotype (xu2021thesarcoendoplasmicreticulum pages 8-9).

Collectively, cellular and animal models employing both genetic knockdown/overexpression and pharmacological rescue strategies provide converging evidence that defective SERCA pump expression and misregulation by its modulators (PLN and SLN) are central drivers of muscle atrophy and sarcopenia. These findings highlight SERCA restoration as a promising therapeutic avenue, validated by small-molecule activators that successfully restore Ca²⁺ handling in myotube systems and in vivo muscle tissue (nogami2021pharmacologicalactivationof pages 13-13).
