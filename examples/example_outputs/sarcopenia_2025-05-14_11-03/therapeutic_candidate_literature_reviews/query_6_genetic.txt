Query: Genetic and functional studies defining the role of SERCA dysfunction and RyR1 leak in sarcopenia pathogenesis: conditional knockouts, patient-derived myotubes with SERCA mutations, mechanistic confirmation of calcium dysregulation driving muscle atrophy and reduced contractile force

The current literature supports a mechanistic model in which calcium (Ca2+) dysregulation due to both SERCA dysfunction and RyR1 leak contributes to sarcopenia by driving muscle atrophy and reduced contractile force, yet direct genetic approaches such as conditional knockouts and patient‐derived myotube studies with SERCA mutations remain underrepresented. Many studies provide robust functional evidence linking oxidative modifications, impaired Ca2+ handling, and downstream activation of proteolytic pathways to muscle weakness in aging.

Functionally, pharmacological studies in aged and genetically modified mice have demonstrated that reduced SERCA activity—despite unaltered protein expression—leads to elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels. For example, in aged mice, reduced SERCA activity was shown to result in inefficient Ca2+ clearance after contraction, promoting mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activation of Ca2+‐dependent proteases such as calpains. These findings align with the observation that pharmacological SERCA activation using small molecules (e.g., CDN1163) can restore normal Ca2+ homeostasis, improve muscle strength, and blunt atrophy, thereby demonstrating mechanistic confirmation that SERCA dysfunction is instrumental in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia (qaisar2020restorationofsarcoplasmic pages 5-7, xu2022impactofaging pages 10-11).

In parallel, RyR1 leak is implicated in disrupting Ca2+ homeostasis. Oxidative stress causes post-translational modifications of RyR1—such as S-nitrosylation and hyperphosphorylation—that result in the dissociation of stabilizing proteins (e.g., FKBP12), thus increasing the channel’s open probability and promoting a “leaky” phenotype. This leak decreases the Ca2+ available for effective muscle contraction and can trigger a cascade of deleterious events including mitochondrial damage and the activation of proteolytic enzymes leading to muscle fiber degradation (agrawal2018roleofdefective pages 5-7, michelucci2021alteredca2+handling pages 8-9).

Despite the strong functional evidence provided from these animal models and pharmacological interventions, the data on genetic models remain sparse. Comprehensive platforms like Open Targets have not uncovered significant associations between SERCA genes (e.g., ATP2A1, which encodes SERCA1) and sarcopenia, and detailed genetic models, such as conditional knockout mice specifically targeting SERCA in skeletal muscle, are not well represented in current datasets (OpenTargets Search: sarcopenia-SERCA,RyR1). Even though several studies reference the use of conditional knockouts and patient-derived myotubes to assess Ca2+ handling abnormalities in other myopathies, their direct application to define the role of SERCA mutations in sarcopenia pathogenesis is limited (xu2021thesarcoendoplasmicreticulum pages 2-4, xu2022impactofaging pages 15-15).

The overall picture that emerges is one in which oxidative stress induces both RyR1 leak and SERCA dysfunction, causing persistent cytosolic Ca2+ elevation. This triggers proteolytic pathways that lead to muscle protein degradation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired excitation–contraction coupling—all hallmark features of sarcopenia (agrawal2018roleofdefective pages 10-11, michelucci2021alteredca2+handling pages 9-11). Although mechanistic studies in animal models and pharmacological intervention data robustly support this model, future work employing conditional knockout systems and patient-derived myotube studies for SERCA mutations is needed to provide direct genetic confirmation of these pathways in sarcopenia (xu2021thesarcoendoplasmicreticulum pages 5-7, conte2021alterationofstim1orai1mediated pages 12-13).

In summary, while the current functional evidence strongly supports that calcium dysregulation—stemming from both SERCA dysfunction and RyR1 leak—is a key driver of muscle atrophy and reduced contractile force in sarcopenia, there is a clear need for more targeted genetic studies involving conditional knockouts and patient-derived myotubes with SERCA mutations to fully validate this mechanistic framework (michelucci2021alteredca2+handling pages 16-18, agrawal2018roleofdefective pages 1-2).
