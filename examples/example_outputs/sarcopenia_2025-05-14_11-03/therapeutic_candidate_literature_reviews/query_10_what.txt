Query: What preclinical or early clinical studies report detailed ADME, pharmacokinetic, and safety data for novel SERCA activators, RyR stabilizers, or store-operated calcium entry modulators, including plasma half-life, tissue distribution to skeletal muscle, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacodynamic target engagement, and early efficacy signals?

The available preclinical and early clinical data do not collectively provide a comprehensive report that covers all detailed ADME parameters, full pharmacokinetic profiles (including plasma half-life and skeletal muscle tissue distribution), maximum tolerated dose, pharmacodynamic target engagement, and early efficacy signals for novel SERCA activators, RyR stabilizers, or store‐operated calcium entry modulators. In the context provided, most detailed investigations have focused on SERCA2a activators.

For instance, the work by Luraghi et al. describes a series of highly selective SERCA2a activators derived from the PST3093 scaffold. Their preclinical studies establish that many of the synthesized compounds stimulate SERCA2a activity at nanomolar concentrations and engage the intended target in biochemical and cellular assays (luraghi2022highlyselectiveserca2a pages 1-3). One highlighted compound (compound 5) further demonstrated favorable safety profiles with reported acute toxicity figures (intravenous LD50 of 300 mg/kg and oral LD50 >800 mg/kg) and improved cardiac function in a diabetic rat model (luraghi2022highlyselectiveserca2a pages 7-8). These results supply pharmacodynamic evidence of SERCA2a target engagement and early efficacy signals in preclinical models. However, these studies do not include detailed ADME investigations such as the measurement of plasma half-life beyond qualitative comparisons (e.g., PST3093’s extended half-life relative to istaroxime) or quantitative analyses of tissue distribution to skeletal muscle (luraghi2022highlyselectiveserca2a pages 1-3, luraghi2022highlyselectiveserca2a pages 7-8).

Regarding RyR stabilizers, several agents (for example, dantrolene, JTV519, and S107) have been discussed within the context of modulating cardiac and skeletal muscle calcium handling (njegic2020targetingca2+ pages 16-17). Dantrolene, in particular, is advanced into clinical evaluation for statin-induced myopathy (NCT06966843). Although its mechanism as an RyR antagonist is well established and its early clinical trial (NCT06966843) focuses on related safety and efficacy endpoints, this study does not report comprehensive preclinical ADME or pharmacokinetic data such as plasma half-life, tissue penetration into skeletal muscle, or maximum tolerated dose beyond the primary clinical endpoints (NCT06966843).

For store-operated calcium entry modulators, the provided context does not describe any studies that include detailed ADME, pharmacokinetics, or safety data. Similarly, while one screening effort using high-throughput methods to identify small molecules targeting RyR1 and SERCA1a function has been mentioned (o’connor2023ryr1relateddiseasesinternational pages 7-8), there is no further elaboration on subsequent in vivo pharmacokinetic evaluations or ADME profiling.

In summary, although preclinical studies such as those by Luraghi et al. offer important insights into pharmacodynamic target engagement and safety in the context of SERCA2a activation (luraghi2022highlyselectiveserca2a pages 1-3, luraghi2022highlyselectiveserca2a pages 7-8, luraghi2022highlyselectiveserca2a pages 10-10), and early clinical evaluation of an RyR stabilizer (dantrolene in NCT06966843) is underway, none of the sources provide a single comprehensive report that covers detailed ADME profiles (including skeletal muscle tissue distribution), full pharmacokinetic measurements (such as plasma half-life), maximum tolerated dose data, as well as complete pharmacodynamic assessments and early efficacy outcomes for this class of compounds.
