Query: What are the key molecular mechanisms driving sarcopenia-associated dysregulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis in aged human skeletal muscle, including roles of oxidative post-translational modifications on RyR1, SERCA pump downregulation, altered ER–mitochondrial Ca²⁺ exchange, and store-operated calcium entry channel dysfunction?

Aging skeletal muscle exhibits a complex dysregulation of intracellular calcium (Ca²⁺) homeostasis that contributes directly to the development of sarcopenia. Four key molecular mechanisms underlie this disruption: oxidative post-translational modifications (PTMs) of the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1), SERCA pump downregulation, altered endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–mitochondrial Ca²⁺ exchange, and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) channel dysfunction.

First, oxidative stress associated with aging induces specific oxidative PTMs on RyR1. These modifications—including S-nitrosylation and S-glutathionylation—destabilize the RyR1 complex, increasing its open probability and promoting pathological Ca²⁺ leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The aberrant leak diminishes the fidelity of excitation–contraction coupling and contributes to an elevated cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration that disrupts normal muscle contraction and relaxation dynamics (conte2024branchedchainaminoacids pages 13-14, michelucci2021alteredca2+handling pages 16-18).

Second, the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA) pump, which is essential for reuptake of Ca²⁺ back into the SR, experiences both reduced expression and oxidative inactivation with age. Downregulation and functional impairment of SERCA, often due to oxidative modifications such as cysteine oxidation, lead to slower clearance of cytosolic Ca²⁺. This prolonged Ca²⁺ elevation not only disrupts muscle relaxation but also predisposes the muscle fibers to stress and fatigue. Pharmacological interventions aimed at restoring SERCA activity have shown promise in reversing these defects, highlighting the potential therapeutic benefit of targeting SERCA downregulation in sarcopenia (qaisar2019restorationofserca pages 11-13, xu2021thesarcoendoplasmicreticulum pages 2-4).

Third, altered ER–mitochondrial Ca²⁺ exchange is implicated in age-related muscle dysfunction. Proper Ca²⁺ transfer between the ER/SR and mitochondria is essential for coupling muscle excitation to energy production. Aging disrupts the spatial organization and functional interaction at mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), leading to mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overload or insufficient uptake. This imbalance impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thus further aggravating oxidative stress and promoting a feedback loop of cellular injury and energy deficit in muscle fibers (dong2025effectsofaging pages 10-11, terrell2023calcium’sroleand pages 19-20).

Lastly, dysfunction in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) channels aggravates Ca²⁺ imbalance in aged muscle. SOCE is integral to replenishing SR Ca²⁺ stores following contraction. Although some core SOCE components like STIM1 and ORAI1 might remain expressed, their functional regulation is often compromised in aging, disrupting the delicate balance of Ca²⁺ influx required for muscle repair and sustained contractility. Impaired SOCE reduces the muscle’s capacity to refill its Ca²⁺ stores, thereby contributing to fatigue and diminished contractile force over time (terrell2023calcium’sroleand pages 7-9).

In summary, the molecular basis of sarcopenia-associated Ca²⁺ dysregulation involves an interrelated network of pathophysiological changes: oxidative PTMs compromise RyR1 function and elevate cytosolic Ca²⁺ through increased leak; SERCA pump downregulation and oxidative inactivation hinder Ca²⁺ clearance; disrupted ER–mitochondrial Ca²⁺ transfer impairs energy metabolism while exacerbating oxidative stress; and SOCE channel dysfunction limits Ca²⁺ store refilling. Together, these anomalies disturb the precise Ca²⁺ signaling required for effective excitation–contraction coupling, thereby driving the progressive muscle weakness and atrophy observed in aging human skeletal muscle (conte2024branchedchainaminoacids pages 13-14, qaisar2019restorationofserca pages 11-13, dong2025effectsofaging pages 10-11, terrell2023calcium’sroleand pages 7-9).
