Query: What are the latest reported small-molecule modulators of ryanodine receptor (RyR) stabilization or junctophilin–RyR interactions that have been tested in aged human or rodent sarcopenic muscle models, including evidence of reduced pathological Ca²⁺ leak, enhanced transient amplitude, improved fatigue resistance, and in vivo muscle strength restoration?

The most promising small‐molecule modulators reported for RyR stabilization in the context of aging-related muscle dysfunction fall into two categories. First are the Rycal drugs, with ARM210 (also known as S48168) being the most prominent candidate. Rycal drugs are benzothiazepine derivatives designed to stabilize RyR1 channels by restoring the interaction with the regulatory protein FKBP12, whose disruption by oxidation or nitrosylation leads to pathological Ca²⁺ leak. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that ARM210 can reduce aberrant SR Ca²⁺ leak, thereby restoring Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and improving fatigue resistance. Notably, data from aged sarcopenic rodent models have provided evidence of improved in vivo muscle strength following ARM210 treatment, suggesting its potential for clinical translation to counteract muscle weakness in aging (Beaufils2022therapiesforryr1related pages 9-10, Marks2023targetingryanodinereceptors pages 6-7).

A second group of modulators identified through high-throughput screening includes natural compounds—specifically myricetin and chloroxine. Myricetin is a natural flavonoid whereas chloroxine is a quinoline derivative; both have been shown in ex vivo experiments with mechanically skinned skeletal muscle fibers to reduce the pathological Ca²⁺ leak through RyR1. Functional assessments using FRET-based assays have indicated that these compounds can enhance the binding of calmodulin to RyR1, and direct measurements in rat muscle fibers have demonstrated that their administration results in an increase in Ca²⁺ transient amplitude relative to control conditions. While these studies report reversible inhibition of RyR1 leak with improvements in excitation–contraction coupling, the data remain primarily at the level of isolated muscle fiber assays. Thus, although myricetin and chloroxine have compelling mechanistic support—with myricetin also exhibiting isoform selectivity by sparing cardiac RyR2—the direct in vivo efficacy in reversing fatigue resistance deficits and restoring overall muscle strength in aged (sarcopenic) animal models or human subjects has not yet been clearly established (Rebbeck2020ryr1targeteddrugdiscovery pages 6-7, Rebbeck2020ryr1targeteddrugdiscovery pages 7-9).

In summary, the latest reported small-molecule modulators in this context are: (1) the Rycal compound ARM210/S48168, which has been tested in aged rodent models and shows evidence of reducing pathological Ca²⁺ leak, enhancing Ca²⁺ transients, and improving fatigue resistance and in vivo strength; and (2) the compounds myricetin and chloroxine emerging from a high-throughput screening platform, which have demonstrated improvements in RyR1-mediated Ca²⁺ handling in ex vivo preparations but require further validation in aged sarcopenic models to conclusively document improvements in fatigue resistance and muscle strength (Beaufils2022therapiesforryr1related pages 2-3, Marks2023targetingryanodinereceptors pages 6-7).
