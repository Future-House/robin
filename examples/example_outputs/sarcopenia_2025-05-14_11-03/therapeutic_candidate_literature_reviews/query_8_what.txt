Query: What is the contribution of chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress to impairment of Ca²⁺ transients in aged myotubes, including cytokine-mediated kinase cascades, redox modifications of calcium channels, and downstream effects on sarcomere structure and contractile apparatus integrity?

Chronic low‐grade inflammation and oxidative stress converge to impair Ca²⁺ transients in aged myotubes by targeting pivotal calcium‐handling proteins through distinct yet interrelated signaling pathways. Elevated pro‐inflammatory cytokines—such as interleukin‐6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF-α), and interleukin‐8 (IL-8)—activate cytokine-mediated kinase cascades (e.g., NF-κB pathways) that phosphorylate calcium channels and regulatory proteins. This kinase-driven modulation can alter the normal gating properties of channels like the ryanodine receptor (RyR), reducing their fidelity in releasing Ca²⁺ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during excitation–contraction coupling (terrell2023calcium’sroleand pages 7-9, granic2023hallmarksofageing pages 7-9).

Simultaneously, increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during chronic oxidative stress cause redox modifications on key residues (e.g., cysteine and methionine) within RyR and SERCA proteins. Modifications such as oxidation, S-nitrosylation, and S-glutathionylation disrupt the normal conformation and function of these channels, leading to increased channel leakiness and reduced Ca²⁺ reuptake. This redox-induced dysregulation diminishes the amplitude of Ca²⁺ transients and prolongs cytosolic Ca²⁺ elevations, hampering the precise, rapid cycling of Ca²⁺ release and reuptake required for muscle contraction (harris2020calciumimagingin pages 8-15, xu2024reactiveoxygenspecies pages 24-25).

The combined effects of kinase-mediated phosphorylation and redox modifications result in a compromised excitation–contraction apparatus. Specifically, the increased leakiness of RyR channels depletes SR Ca²⁺ stores, while impaired SERCA function delays Ca²⁺ clearance. This dual disruption not only reduces the effectiveness of Ca²⁺ transients but also contributes to a state of persistent intracellular Ca²⁺ dysregulation (szentesi2019changesinredox pages 9-10, michelucci2021alteredca2+handling pages 8-9).

Downstream, the impaired Ca²⁺ signaling activates proteolytic pathways—via enzymes such as calpain and caspase-3—that degrade crucial sarcomeric proteins, leading to structural disorganization within the myofibrils. This degradation undermines sarcomere integrity and diminishes contractile function as the precise alignment of contractile proteins is lost, ultimately contributing to muscle weakness and atrophy (harris2020calciumimagingin pages 80-83, dowling2023fibertypeshiftingin pages 42-43).

Moreover, the chronic inflammatory milieu further exacerbates these issues by continuously activating kinase cascades that not only alter calcium channel function via phosphorylation but may also interfere with mitochondrial function; mitochondrial dysfunction itself can lead to additional ROS production in a deleterious feedback loop. The resultant imbalance in Ca²⁺ homeostasis directly impairs excitation–contraction coupling, thereby precipitating the structural and functional decline of the contractile apparatus in aged myotubes (michelucci2021alteredca2+handling pages 9-11, mijares2021senescenceisassociated pages 6-7).

In summary, chronic low‐grade inflammation initiates cytokine-mediated kinase cascades that phosphorylate calcium channels, while oxidative stress induces redox modifications that further compromise these channels’ functionality. The combined impact of these processes disrupts Ca²⁺ transient amplitude and timing, leading to depleted SR Ca²⁺ stores and persistent cytosolic Ca²⁺ elevation. Ultimately, this cascade of events activates proteolytic enzymes that dismantle sarcomere structure, impairing the contractile apparatus and contributing to the muscle weakness observed in aged myotubes (terrell2023calcium’sroleand pages 7-9, granic2023hallmarksofageing pages 14-16).
