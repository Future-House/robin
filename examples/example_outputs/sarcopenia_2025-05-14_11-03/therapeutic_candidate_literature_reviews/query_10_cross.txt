Query: Cross-talk between calcium signaling and proteostasis pathways (ubiquitin-proteasome, autophagy) in aged skeletal muscle: studies on Ca2+-dependent regulation of muscle protein turnover in sarcopenia and modulation by calcium-targeting small molecules

Calcium signaling and proteostasis pathways are intricately intertwined in aged skeletal muscle, where disruptions in Ca2+ homeostasis contribute significantly to sarcopenia. Aging muscle exhibits altered Ca2+ handling at the neuromuscular junction and within myofibers, which in turn impacts both the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy, two critical proteolytic pathways. The resulting imbalance in protein synthesis and degradation leads to muscle mass decline and functional deficits (hughes2022ubiquitinligasesin pages 6-7, triolo2021theimpactof pages 52-56).

Calcium plays a central role in modulating multiple aspects of protein turnover via its influence on downstream effectors. Beyond its well-known function in initiating excitation-contraction coupling, Ca2+ regulates proteolytic pathways through calcium-dependent proteases such as calpains. Calpains, activated by elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels, cleave structural proteins and provide substrates for subsequent ubiquitination and degradation by the UPS (gehlert2015ca2+dependentregulationsand pages 1-4, xiaoping2016themolecularmechanisms pages 10-12). In addition, Ca2+ influences the activity of kinases and phosphatases, including CaMK and calcineurin, which are pivotal for transcriptional adaptations that govern the expression of muscle-specific proteins and regulators of proteostasis (gehlert2015ca2+dependentregulationsand pages 13-15).

The UPS is particularly sensitive to changes in intracellular Ca2+ signaling. In aged skeletal muscle, altered Ca2+ transients have been linked to the dysregulation of specific E3 ubiquitin ligases such as MuRF1 and atrogin-1, which target key myofibrillar proteins for degradation. Dysregulated UPS activity not only exacerbates muscle atrophy but also contributes to a decline in overall proteome quality. Studies in aged muscle models have shown that impaired Ca2+ handling, whether through neuromuscular junction degeneration or mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately affects UPS-mediated protein turnover and leads to compromised muscle maintenance (hughes2022ubiquitinligasesin pages 18-20).

Autophagy, another critical proteostasis pathway, is similarly modulated by Ca2+ signaling. Elevated intracellular calcium can activate autophagic pathways via effectors such as CaMKKB, which in turn activates AMPK. This activation facilitates the induction of autophagy-related proteins including ULK1 and transcription factors such as FoxO3 and Tfeb, which orchestrate the expression of autophagy-lysosome system components. However, in aged muscle, alterations in Ca2+ signaling contribute to a scenario where autophagosome formation is not necessarily impaired, yet defects in autophagic flux emerge due to sustained mTORC1 signaling and altered FoxO3 regulation (triolo2021manifestationsofage pages 4-5, triolo2021manifestationsofage pages 16-17).

Therapeutically, the modulation of calcium-dependent pathways using small molecules presents a promising avenue for addressing sarcopenia. Calcium-targeting agents can potentially restore proper Ca2+ homeostasis, thereby normalizing the activities of calpains, kinases, and autophagic regulators. In preclinical models, interventions that modulate calcium signaling have been shown to affect neuromuscular junction stability and improve protein turnover through both the UPS and autophagy systems. For instance, by targeting calcium-activated proteases, one may attenuate myofibrillar disassembly, preserve cytoskeletal integrity, and ultimately reduce muscle atrophy (haberechtmuller2021outofcontrol pages 8-9, kruger2021outofcontrol pages 8-9).

In summary, the cross-talk between calcium signaling and proteostasis pathways constitutes a complex regulatory network that significantly impacts muscle protein turnover in aged skeletal muscle. Disruptions in Ca2+ homeostasis not only impair excitation-contraction coupling but also lead to maladaptive activation of proteolytic systems that contribute to sarcopenia. Modulation of these calcium-dependent mechanisms using small molecules holds potential as a therapeutic strategy to restore proteostasis and thereby mitigate age-related muscle loss (hughes2022ubiquitinligasesin pages 6-7, triolo2021theimpactof pages 52-56).
