Query: Which candidate compounds with known pharmacokinetic, ADME, and safety profiles—particularly oral bioavailability, skeletal muscle tissue penetration, metabolic stability, and human tolerability data—have been evaluated for modulating calcium-handling proteins in preclinical models of muscle aging or related myopathies?

The best‐characterized candidate compounds that meet these criteria are CK‑2127107 and Tirasemtiv. Both agents were originally developed to modulate calcium handling in skeletal muscle, specifically by increasing the calcium sensitivity of fast skeletal muscle troponin, and they have confirmed profiles regarding oral bioavailability, ADME properties, metabolic stability, skeletal muscle tissue penetration, and human tolerability.

CK‑2127107 is a 2‑aminoalkyl‑5‑N‑heteroarylpyrimidine derivative that functions by slowing the release of calcium from fast skeletal muscle troponin. This mechanism increases sarcomere calcium sensitivity, thereby enhancing contractility in fast skeletal fibers without affecting slow skeletal or cardiac muscles. Its pharmacokinetic properties are quite robust; for example, in rodent models it shows evidence of brain penetrance with a brain/plasma ratio of up to 0.51 after 42 days, and it accumulates in tissues while maintaining stable plasma levels, indicating favorable metabolic stability. Moreover, Phase I clinical trial data have demonstrated its good safety and tolerability in healthy humans, underscoring a well‐characterized ADME profile that along with its oral bioavailability and tissue penetration makes it a compelling candidate for neuromuscular disorders with muscle aging or myopathy features (calder2016smallmoleculesin pages 7-8).

Tirasemtiv, the second candidate, is an earlier small-molecule fast skeletal troponin activator that similarly functions by enhancing the muscle response to submaximal motor nerve stimulation. It improves muscle strength and exercise performance in preclinical neuromuscular models and has advanced to Phase III clinical trials in ALS. This progression is indicative of a strong preclinical foundation, including established pharmacokinetics, ADME properties, oral bioavailability, and human tolerability profiles. As such, Tirasemtiv has been shown to modulate calcium handling in a manner comparable to CK‑2127107, serving as an additional proof-of-concept that calcium-handling modulation can provide therapeutic benefits in muscle-related pathology (calder2016smallmoleculesin pages 7-8).

It is important to note that while these candidates have been evaluated in the context of neuromuscular diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the underlying mechanism—enhancement of calcium-mediated contractility—relates directly to muscle atrophy and dysfunction observed in conditions of muscle aging and myopathy. Despite a clinical trial search on ClinicalTrials.gov for compounds meeting these stringent pharmacokinetic and ADME parameters in the specific context of muscle aging and myopathies returning zero results, the preclinical and early clinical data for CK‑2127107 and Tirasemtiv indicate that these compounds have been studied in models relevant to modulating calcium-handling proteins (Clinical Trials Search: calcium handling modulators AND (muscle OR myopathy) AND (oral bioavailability OR ADME OR pharmacokinetics OR tissue penetration OR metabolic stability OR tolerability)).

In summary, CK‑2127107 and Tirasemtiv emerge as the most well-documented candidate compounds with known pharmacokinetic profiles, including oral bioavailability, skeletal muscle tissue penetration, metabolic stability, and human tolerability. Their evaluation in neuromuscular disease models provides a translational framework for their potential use in addressing muscle aging and related myopathies through modulation of calcium-handling proteins (calder2016smallmoleculesin pages 7-8).
