Query: Screening assays linking calcium transient amplitude, kinetics, and spatial dynamics to quantitative contractile force output in human myotubes: high-throughput formats, throughput benchmarks, correlation of restored Ca2+ flux with contractile endpoints, disease-relevant model validation

Screening assays that link calcium transient amplitude, kinetics, and spatial dynamics to quantitative contractile force output in human myotubes are built on integrated platforms that record both intracellular calcium flux and mechanical performance in parallel. One prominent high‐throughput format is the MyoTACTIC platform, a 96‐well culture system that enables longitudinal, non-invasive assessments of human skeletal muscle microtissues (hMMTs) by combining fluorescence-based calcium imaging (using genetically encoded indicators such as GCaMP6f) with automated analysis of contractile forces via PDMS micro‐post deflections (afshar2020a96wellculture pages 1-2).

This integrated approach takes advantage of the miniaturized 96‐well format, which inherently supports high throughput by allowing simultaneous culture and measurement of numerous samples, thereby facilitating large-scale drug screening and kinetic analyses (afshar2020a96wellculture pages 2-3). Measurements of Ca2+ transient parameters—specifically amplitude, rise and decay kinetics, and in some systems spatial dynamics—are directly correlated with contractile force outputs as determined by precise, automated imaging algorithms that track micro-post deflection and contractile motion (afshar2020a96wellculture pages 5-7).

Throughput benchmarks in these platforms are largely defined by the format itself: the use of a 96-well plate readily allows multiple samples to be processed in parallel, and additional automation via Python-based analysis scripts further enhances data acquisition efficiency. Although exact numerical benchmarks (such as sample processing rate per hour) are not specified explicitly in the provided context, the design inherently supports high-throughput screening compared to lower-scale systems that rely on manual force transducer coupling (juhas2016designevaluationand pages 9-10).

Moreover, systems developed for cardiovascular applications, such as CardioPyRate, illustrate that high-throughput assays integrating digital video microscopy and optical flow algorithms can quantify contractile displacements and corresponding calcium transient dynamics in hiPSC-derived tissues—a methodology conceptually similar to the approaches used for human myotubes (plakhotnik2023clinicallyrelevantmodels pages 41-44). The adaptation of these methods to skeletal muscle models has facilitated studies where changes in calcium transients are quantitatively linked to contractile endpoints, thereby validating the causative relationship between excitation-contraction coupling and force generation.

Correlation of restored Ca2+ flux with contractile endpoints is key for both drug screening and disease modeling. In platforms like MyoTACTIC, pharmacological agents known to cause myotoxicity—such as dexamethasone and cerivastatin—demonstrate decreased contractile performance that is paralleled by alterations in calcium transient characteristics, while agents like IGF-1 enhance both calcium dynamics and force generation (afshar2020a96wellculture pages 1-2). This demonstrates that measurement of calcium transient parameters can serve as a proxy for muscle functionality, allowing early detection of functional deficits before overt structural changes are evident.

Validation in disease-relevant models is achieved by applying these integrated assays to human myotubes derived from primary myogenic progenitor cells, as well as through adaptation of methods used in cardiomyocyte models. For example, platforms based on μGroove-enhanced substrates have shown that alignment and morphological maturation lead to improved excitation-contraction coupling, as reflected by robust calcium transient responses and higher tetanic-to-twitch ratios (vesgacastro2024developmentofan pages 11-12). Similarly, modifications of the assay conditions, such as chronic electrical stimulation, have been employed to mimic in vivo physiological conditions and to validate the model under disease-relevant contexts (vesgacastro2024developmentofan pages 1-3).

Furthermore, methodologies such as those discussed by Rausch et al. for measuring skeletal muscle fiber contractility via high-speed traction microscopy underscore the importance of high temporal resolution (up to 2048 Hz) when linking rapid calcium flux changes to contractile events; while this particular study was conducted on mouse fibers, the underlying principles provide a foundation for similar assays in human myotubes (rausch2020measurementofskeletal pages 1-4).

Overall, the current body of work demonstrates that high-throughput assay formats—whether based on engineered 96-well systems or advanced video microscopy protocols—are capable of quantitatively correlating calcium transient dynamics (amplitude, kinetics, and spatial behavior) with mechanical force output. These integrated platforms have been validated using pharmacological interventions and bioengineering approaches that ensure their relevance to disease modeling and drug screening applications (plakhotnik2023clinicallyrelevantmodels pages 34-36, afshar2020a96wellculture pages 5-7).
