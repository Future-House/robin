Query: ADME, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic profiles of candidate small molecules with calcium signaling modulation activity in skeletal muscle: clinical or advanced preclinical data reporting bioavailability, muscle tissue distribution, safety margins, and human tolerability in related musculoskeletal indications

Candidate small molecules that modulate calcium signaling in skeletal muscle have been evaluated primarily as fast skeletal troponin activators, and the available advanced preclinical and early clinical data provide initial insights but remain limited in detailing full ADME, toxicity, and tissue distribution profiles. For example, CK-2127107, developed to sensitize the fast skeletal troponin complex to calcium, has demonstrated efficacy in animal models such as rats with neuromuscular diseases and heart failure‐associated skeletal myopathy, where it improved muscle force at submaximal stimulation frequencies in diaphragm and hind‐limb muscles (calder2016smallmoleculesin pages 7-8). Preclinical studies noted good systemic bioavailability and significant tissue distribution, as indicated indirectly by a brain-to-plasma ratio of up to 0.51:1 following repeated dosing, although precise skeletal muscle tissue distribution parameters were not explicitly reported (calder2016smallmoleculesin pages 7-8).

Toxicology profiles for these compounds have been preliminarily characterized only through early-phase clinical assessments. In Phase I randomized, placebo-controlled studies involving healthy subjects, CK-2127107 was well tolerated, with acceptable safety indicating no immediate red flags for toxicity. However, detailed safety margins, such as specific LD50 values or comprehensive toxicity biomarker profiles, have not been provided in the available excerpts (calder2016smallmoleculesin pages 7-8). This limitation is common among early clinical studies of this class of compounds, where the primary focus is on establishing proof-of-mechanism and preliminary efficacy rather than complete toxicological profiling.

Other candidate fast skeletal troponin activators such as Tirasemtiv and its next-generation analogue, Reldesemtiv, have undergone extensive pharmacodynamic and safety evaluations. Tirasemtiv, for example, showed enhancement of muscle response in preclinical models and early clinical trials but was associated with adverse central effects such as dizziness and fatigue, attributed in part to blood–brain barrier penetration (alsulami2020smallmoleculesacting pages 11-13). In contrast, Reldesemtiv, designed to limit such adverse effects by reducing brain penetration, demonstrated dose-dependent increases in muscle response in Phase I studies. However, in Phase II/III trials targeting ALS, Reldesemtiv did not achieve statistically significant improvements in slow vital capacity, and detailed data on its bioavailability in skeletal muscle or precise tissue distribution were not disclosed (alsulami2020smallmoleculesacting pages 11-13, tarantino2022therapeutictargetsin pages 4-5).

Another investigational compound, Levosimendan, currently under clinical investigation as a calcium sensitizer, is similarly mentioned without accompanying detailed pharmacokinetic descriptors specific to skeletal muscle; available data focus on its clinical potential rather than in-depth ADME parameters such as muscle tissue distribution, plasma protein binding, or metabolic stability in skeletal muscle environments (tarantino2022therapeutictargetsin pages 2-4, tarantino2022therapeutictargetsin pages 6-7).

Overall, while early preclinical and Phase I data indicate that these small molecules exhibit promising oral bioavailability, measurable systemic exposure, and acceptable tolerability profiles, explicit data on muscle-specific tissue distribution, full ADME characterization, and comprehensive safety margins in the context of musculoskeletal indications remain insufficiently reported. Further advanced preclinical studies focusing on these pharmacokinetic and toxicological details in relevant musculoskeletal models, along with rigorous translational studies in patient cohorts, are needed to establish their safety profiles and to enable rational drug development in neuromuscular disorders (calder2016smallmoleculesin pages 7-8, alsulami2020smallmoleculesacting pages 11-13, tarantino2022therapeutictargetsin pages 2-4).
