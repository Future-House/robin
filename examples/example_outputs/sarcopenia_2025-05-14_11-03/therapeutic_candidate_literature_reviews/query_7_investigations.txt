Query: Investigations into age-associated impairments in store-operated calcium entry (STIM1/Orai1) in skeletal muscle fibers: evidence linking reduced SOCE to sarcopenia-related muscle weakness, target validation, and potential small-molecule modulators or peptide inhibitors tested in relevant models

There is accumulating evidence that age-associated impairments in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), mediated by the proteins STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) and Orai1 (Orai calcium release-activated calcium modulator 1), contribute to sarcopenia-related muscle weakness. In aged skeletal muscle, reduced SOCE capacity has been linked to decreased contractile force and heightened fatigue susceptibility. For instance, studies in aged (2-year-old) mice document a significant reduction in STIM1/Orai1-mediated SOCE even though transcript levels for these proteins remain unchanged, suggesting that post-transcriptional modifications or alterations in triad architecture, such as diminished expression of mitsugumin-29, are likely responsible for the impaired calcium influx (michelucci2018roleofstim1orai1mediated pages 14-15). This mechanism is supported by functional investigations where blockade of SOCE in young muscles mimics the aged phenotype, underscoring a causative link between impaired SOCE and muscle weakness (michelucci2018roleofstim1orai1mediated pages 14-15).

Target validation studies in preclinical models have provided mechanistic insights into the role of STIM1/Orai1 in maintaining muscle function. Although direct target validation in human sarcopenia remains limited, numerous studies in murine models demonstrate that modulation of SOCE can alter muscle performance. For example, altered STIM1 protein expression and changes in SOCE dynamics have been associated with calcium dyshomeostasis during aging, which negatively impacts excitation–contraction coupling and, ultimately, muscle fiber function (conte2021alterationofstim1orai1mediated pages 13-15, terrell2023calcium’sroleand pages 7-9). Moreover, the literature suggests that interventions capable of normalizing SOCE might improve muscle function, thereby providing a rationale for further exploration of STIM1/Orai1 as therapeutic targets in sarcopenia (OpenTargets Search: sarcopenia-STIM1,Orai1).

Regarding potential small-molecule modulators and peptide inhibitors, several compounds have been identified that modulate SOCE in related contexts. Various inhibitors including BTP2, gadolinium (Gd3+), and the peptide inhibitor GsMTx-4 have been used to reduce pathological Ca2+ influx in models of malignant hyperthermia, demonstrating the capacity to attenuate abnormal calcium signaling through ORAI1-dependent channels (michelucci2018roleofstim1orai1mediated pages 14-15). Additionally, FDA-approved drugs like leflunomide and teriflunomide, together with molecules such as lansoprazole, tolvaptan, and roflumilast, have emerged from in silico screens as potential SOCE inhibitors, although these have not yet been tested directly in sarcopenia models (conte2021alterationofstim1orai1mediated pages 13-15). Novel chemical entities, such as pyrtriazoles and pyrazole SKF-96365 analogues, also demonstrate inhibitory effects on CRAC channels, thereby offering additional avenues for modulating the SOCE pathway (protasi2021improperremodelingof pages 22-23).

Furthermore, peptide regulators like JMV2894 have shown promising results in cachexia models by preventing the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and restoring the expression of STIM1 and Orai1. Although the primary studies of such peptide-based interventions have been directed towards cachexia, the mechanistic similarities between cachexia and sarcopenia suggest that these peptides could also serve as effective modulators for age-related muscle weakness (conte2021alterationofstim1orai1mediated pages 13-15).

In summary, the current body of work highlights that diminished STIM1/Orai1-mediated SOCE is a plausible contributor to age-related muscle weakness observed in sarcopenia. While mechanistic studies in animal models offer target validation for this pathway, there remains a notable gap in translational research as direct testing of small-molecule or peptide inhibitors in sarcopenia-specific models is sparse. Further investigation is needed to validate these targets fully and develop effective therapeutic interventions for mitigating age-associated muscle weakness (conte2021alterationofstim1orai1mediated pages 13-15, terrell2023calcium’sroleand pages 7-9).
