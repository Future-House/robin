Query: Which small-molecule screening platforms and library compositions have demonstrated success in identifying modulators that restore calcium signaling and contractile function in patient-derived or aged human myotube models, and what validation assays confirmed their target engagement, dose-response relationships, and functional rescue of muscle contraction?

A number of complementary small‐molecule screening platforms have successfully identified compounds that not only modulate calcium signaling but also restore contractile function in human myotube models derived from patients or aged tissue. One prominent approach focuses on targeting the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)‐based high‐throughput screening (HTS). In this platform, isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles are used in a 1536‐well format with chemical libraries (e.g., the LOPAC collection), and interactions between fluorescently labeled FKBP12.6 (donor) and calmodulin (acceptor) are monitored. Hits such as myricetin that increased FRET efficiency were further validated using secondary assays. These included [3H]ryanodine binding assays and direct measurements of SR Ca2+ leak in mechanically skinned human muscle fibers that preserve the excitation–contraction (EC) coupling apparatus. Dose–response relationships were quantitatively established via Hill function fits, thereby confirming target engagement and functional rescue of Ca2+ homeostasis as well as normal contractility under physiologically relevant conditions (rebbeck2020ryr1targeteddrugdiscovery pages 7-9, 9-10).

An alternative screening strategy involves combinatorial small‐molecule libraries aimed at enhancing the maturation of human pluripotent stem cell–derived myotubes. Although the primary readout in these screens is an increase in myogenic markers (e.g., enhanced myosin heavy chain [MyHC] expression and fusion indices), the improved maturation is intrinsically linked to the restoration of effective calcium signaling and contractile function. Validation in these studies is achieved by combining quantitative immunostaining, transcriptomic analyses (RNA-seq), and functional contractility assays in 3D-engineered muscle constructs that respond to electrical stimulation. These readouts collectively confirm that the applied compounds engage their targets in relevant signaling pathways, produce dose-dependent effects, and ultimately restore muscle contraction capability (selvaraj2019screeningidentifiessmall pages 2-4, 13-15).

A multi-species discovery pipeline further reinforces these findings. In this approach, initial high-throughput screens in simpler organisms (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans) and vertebrate models (such as zebrafish) are used to identify candidate compounds, particularly for RYR1-related myopathies. Subsequent testing in mouse myotubes includes dose-dependent calcium imaging (e.g., caffeine-induced Ca2+ release assays) and direct contractility assessments, validating that the modulators effectively normalize aberrant calcium signaling and rescue muscle function. This integrative strategy effectively supports cross-species target engagement and functional restoration (volpatti2020identificationofdrug pages 1-2).

Additional platforms have applied TR-FRET-based strategies to screen for compounds that modulate actomyosin interactions through alterations in actin polymerization dynamics. Although these assays primarily assess biochemical kinetics (e.g., myofibrillar ATPase activity and polymerization half-times), they provide complementary evidence that the identified compounds, by altering actin dynamics, can potentially improve contractility in muscle fibers. Dose-dependent effects and specificity in these assays further substantiate target engagement (phung2020insightsonmuscle pages 57-60).

Finally, studies in dystrophic contexts (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy and myotonic dystrophy type 1) have combined small-molecule screening with orthogonal validation approaches such as proximity ligation assays, splicing assessments via RNA-seq, and fluorescence RNA foci quantification. These methods not only confirmed biochemical target engagement but also reassured that the compounds can restore normal calcium handling and muscle functional outputs (aristizabal2017effectofnovel pages 155-160, frias2024identifyingnoveltherapeutics pages 53-56, neault2020highthroughputscreeningof pages 115-120).

In summary, screening platforms based on FRET biosensors in high-throughput formats (using libraries like LOPAC), combinatorial small-molecule treatments in pluripotent stem cell–derived myotubes, and multi-species validation pipelines have demonstrated success. They rely on a combination of biochemical assays ([3H]ryanodine binding, TR-FRET), calcium imaging, direct contractility measurements, gene expression, and structural analyses to validate target engagement, dose responsiveness, and ultimately, the functional rescue of muscle contraction in patient-derived or aged myotube models (rebbeck2020ryr1targeteddrugdiscovery pages 7-9, 9-10, selvaraj2019screeningidentifiessmall pages 2-4, volpatti2020identificationofdrug pages 1-2).
