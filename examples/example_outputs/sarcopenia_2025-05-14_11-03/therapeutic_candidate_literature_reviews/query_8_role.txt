Query: Role of store-operated calcium entry (STIM1/Orai1) signaling axis in maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis and contractile function in aged skeletal muscle: loss- and gain-of-function studies in human primary myotubes, aged animal models, and sarcopenia patient cohorts

Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) mediated by STIM1 and Orai1 is critical for refilling intracellular Ca2+ stores and sustaining excitation–contraction coupling (ECC) in skeletal muscle, and this signaling axis plays an equally pivotal role in aged muscle where calcium homeostasis becomes compromised (conte2021alterationofstim1orai1mediated pages 7-9). In skeletal muscle fibers, STIM1, a sensor located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)/endoplasmic reticulum (ER), detects Ca2+ depletion and migrates to regions adjacent to the plasma membrane where it activates the Orai1 channels to allow extracellular Ca2+ influx, replenishing intracellular stores required for continued muscle contraction (michelucci2018roleofstim1orai1mediated pages 1-3).

Loss-of-function studies in human primary myotubes and aged animal models have provided direct evidence for the importance of balanced SOCE in muscle contractility. Downregulation or silencing of STIM1 or Orai1 reduces the amplitude of Ca2+ transients, depletes SR Ca2+ content, and ultimately impairs contractile performance (brunettiUnknownyearphysiologicalrolesof pages 38-41). In vitro experiments using human myotubes have shown that compromised SOCE leads to attenuated Ca2+ signals upon electrical stimulation, which is indispensable for proper muscle differentiation and maintenance (brunettiUnknownyearphysiologicalrolesof pages 107-110). In aged skeletal muscle, despite unchanged transcript levels of STIM1 and Orai1, post-transcriptional modifications or disruptions in triad architecture—such as the loss of mitsugumin-29—hinder effective Ca2+ signaling, thereby contributing to the sarcopenic phenotype characterized by muscle weakness and increased fatigue (michelucci2018roleofstim1orai1mediated pages 14-15, dong2025effectsofaging pages 7-9).

Conversely, gain-of-function studies have elucidated that excessive activation of the STIM1/Orai1 axis can be deleterious. Increased SOCE has been linked to pathological calcium overload which is associated with conditions such as tubular aggregate myopathy and Stormorken syndrome, where constitutive Ca2+ entry disrupts normal muscle architecture and function (conte2021alterationofstim1orai1mediated pages 15-16). Such studies emphasize that not only insufficient but also excessive Ca2+ influx can cause aberrant intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis resulting in muscle pathology, highlighting the necessity of finely tuned SOCE activity for optimal muscle performance (conte2021alterationofstim1orai1mediated pages 16-18).

In aged animal models, reduced efficiency of the STIM1/Orai1-mediated SOCE pathway correlates with diminished contractile force and susceptibility to fatigue, underscoring the role of this signaling axis in maintaining muscle endurance during repetitive stimulation (michelucci2018roleofstim1orai1mediated pages 14-15). Furthermore, clinical observations in sarcopenia patient cohorts support these experimental findings by demonstrating that impaired SOCE is associated with muscle atrophy and reduced functional capacity, thus providing a link between disrupted calcium handling and the progression of age-related muscle degeneration (conte2021alterationofstim1orai1mediated pages 11-12).

Interventions aiming to restore or preserve SOCE functionality have shown promise in preclinical models. For instance, long-term exercise has been shown to prevent the mislocalization of STIM1 and Orai1 within tubular aggregates, thereby maintaining the formation of specialized Ca2+ entry units (CEUs) that support efficient Ca2+ replenishment in aged muscles (boncompagni2021longtermexercisereduces pages 1-2). This evidence collectively suggests that modulating the STIM1/Orai1-mediated SOCE pathway is a viable therapeutic strategy to counteract age-associated sarcopenia, by restoring Ca2+ homeostasis and improving contractile function in skeletal muscle (girolami2023searchingformechanisms pages 15-16).

In summary, both loss- and gain-of-function studies across in vitro human myotubes, aged animal models, and observations in sarcopenia patient cohorts underline the critical role of STIM1/Orai1 signaling in maintaining Ca2+ balance and muscle contractility during aging. Precise modulation of this pathway is essential, as diminished or excessive SOCE can precipitate muscle weakness and degeneration, making it a highly relevant target for therapeutic intervention in aging-related muscle dysfunction (conte2021alterationofstim1orai1mediated pages 7-9, michelucci2018roleofstim1orai1mediated pages 14-15).
