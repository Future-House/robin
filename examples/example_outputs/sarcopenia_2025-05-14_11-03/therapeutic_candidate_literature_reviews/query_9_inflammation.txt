Query: Inflammation-mediated modulation of calcium signaling in aged myotubes: effects of chronic cytokine exposure (TNF-α, IL-6) on calcium channel expression/function, excitation–contraction coupling deficiency, and mechanistic studies validating causative role in muscle atrophy

Chronic exposure to the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 profoundly disrupts calcium signaling in aged myotubes, ultimately contributing to excitation–contraction (E–C) coupling deficiencies and muscle atrophy. TNF-α directly affects key calcium handling proteins. It impairs calcium homeostasis by acting on the ryanodine receptor (RyR2), where it induces functional disturbances that result in increased frequency and asynchrony of spontaneous calcium release events. In parallel, TNF-α negatively modulates the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2) pump through a mechanism involving its regulatory protein phospholamban. Under normal circumstances, phosphorylation of phospholamban relieves SERCA2 inhibition, but TNF-α promotes PKCα activation and subsequent upregulation of protein phosphatase-1 activity that dephosphorylates phospholamban. This sequence of events reinforces SERCA2 inhibition, decreases calcium reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and impairs E–C coupling (dejesus2022cytokinepathwaysin pages 2-4).

IL-6, while less directly connected to calcium channel expression, disrupts muscle cell anabolic and regenerative pathways through the STAT3–SOS3 axis. This cytokine-induced signaling reduces the anabolic influence of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) by upregulating suppressors of cytokine signaling, thereby hindering proper muscle repair and indirectly affecting the environment necessary for effective calcium handling and myotube function (heitman2024skeletalmuscleinjury pages 9-11).

In addition to the direct effects on calcium handling proteins, TNF-α induces oxidative stress by stimulating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). These oxidant species can modify the conformation and function of calcium channels and contractile proteins, thereby further compromising the precision of excitation–contraction coupling. This oxidative modification is a key mechanism by which muscle contractile function is depressed independently of any atrophic loss (powers2016diseaseinducedskeletalmuscle pages 13-14).

At a transcriptional and regulatory level, chronic TNF-α exposure alters gene expression in differentiating skeletal muscle cells. It disrupts the normal expression kinetics of myogenic regulatory factors (e.g., MyoD) through sustained NF-κB activation. This disruption not only interferes with normal myotube formation and differentiation but also shifts the balance toward catabolic pathways. The resulting gene reprogramming promotes proteolysis via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and upregulation of other proteolytic pathways, further contributing to muscle atrophy (meyer2015tumornecrosisfactor pages 26-28, meyer2015tumornecrosisfactor pages 22-23, meyer2015tumornecrosisfactor pages 32-34).

Complementing these findings, activation of NF-κB also suppresses genes encoding components critical for proper calcium signaling and E–C coupling, linking inflammatory signaling to disrupted ion channel function at the cellular level (constantinteodosiu2021molecularmechanismsof pages 6-7, fausnacht2018therelationshipsof pages 23-27). Experimental studies in both cellular and animal models further validate these mechanisms. For instance, interventions such as antioxidant treatment or blockade of TNF-α signaling have been shown to partially restore calcium handling and muscle function, underscoring the causative role of inflammation in the development of muscle wasting and contractile dysfunction (powers2016diseaseinducedskeletalmuscle pages 11-13, meyer2015tumornecrosisfactor pages 30-31).

In summary, chronic TNF-α and IL-6 exposure in aged myotubes disrupts calcium channel expression and function, impairs the excitation–contraction coupling process, and promotes a cascade of oxidative and proteolytic events that culminate in muscle atrophy. This integrative view is supported by mechanistic data detailing how inflammatory mediator-induced alterations in calcium signaling directly translate to defects in muscle contractility and regenerative capacity.
