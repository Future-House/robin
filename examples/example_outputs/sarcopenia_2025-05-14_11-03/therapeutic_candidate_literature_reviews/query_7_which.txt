Query: Which genetic, transcriptomic, or proteomic studies provide strong validation that specific calcium-handling proteins such as SERCA1/2, RyR1, STIM1, or Orai1 play causative roles in sarcopenia pathophysiology, ideally including knockout or patient mutation analyses in aged myotube or animal models with functional readouts?

Several lines of evidence from genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies provide strong support linking calcium‐handling proteins to sarcopenia phenotypes. For example, Qaisar et al. demonstrated that overexpression of SERCA can mitigate age‐related muscle atrophy and weakness in mice, providing functional and genetic data that validate the protective role of SERCA isoforms in skeletal muscle aging (qaisar2020restorationofsarcoplasmic pages 11-13). Although the Open Targets Platform data indicate generally low confidence for SERCA1/2, this experimental work in aged animal models adds critical functional readouts by showing that modulating SERCA activity alters calcium homeostasis and muscle function.

Several knockout and mutation studies have directly implicated STIM1 in muscle pathology. Lengle and colleagues performed genetic knockout and knock‐in studies in mice demonstrating that loss-of-function mutations in STIM1 cause impaired muscle differentiation, reduced muscle mass, and early lethality, while gain-of-function mutations (e.g., the R304W variant) result in increased calcium influx, muscle fiber degeneration, and functional deficits that resemble sarcopenia features (lengle2020musclefibertype pages 12-16, lengle2020musclefibertype pages 41-44). Complementary work by Silva-Rojas et al. using a STIM1 gain-of-function mouse model further showed that increased resting intracellular Ca²⁺ levels, elevated creatine kinase, and mitochondrial swelling are associated with muscle degeneration, thus strengthening the causative link between aberrant STIM1 activity and muscle pathology (silvarojas2019stim1overactivationgenerates pages 10-11).

Additional proteomic analyses have provided evidence on the role of RyR1 in muscle dysfunction. In a quantitative proteomic study, Eckhardt et al. found that RyR1 is uniquely downregulated in multiple muscle types in mutant mice with congenital myopathies, and such alterations in calcium release channels have been associated with calcium leak and muscle weakness seen in aged muscle (eckhardt2023quantitativeproteomicanalysis pages 18-20). While not exclusively performed in aged models, these analyses suggest that RyR1 dysregulation exerts pathophysiological effects compatible with the mechanisms underlying sarcopenia.

Moreover, studies focusing on the SOCE complex have documented the involvement of Orai1 in muscle function. Lengle et al. reported that genetic perturbations affecting STIM1 and Orai1 activity result in altered muscle fiber type distribution and compromised excitation–contraction coupling, as evidenced by both knockout models and mutation analyses (lengle2020musclefibertype pages 16-19). Although patient mutation analyses for Orai1 are more prominently described in the context of myopathies, the convergence of animal genetic studies emphasizes its pivotal role in maintaining skeletal muscle calcium homeostasis.

Lastly, complementary transcriptomic and proteomic data from Kanazawa et al. in aged mouse skeletal muscle indicate altered expression and mislocalization of SERCA isoforms along with other sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins, which correlate with impaired calcium uptake and muscle contractility in sarcopenia even though direct knockout studies were not described in that excerpt (kanazawa2024theeffectsof pages 1-2, kanazawa2024theeffectsof pages 16-17).

In summary, the strongest validation of the causative roles of SERCA1/2, RyR1, STIM1, and Orai1 in sarcopenia pathophysiology comes from genetic knockout/mutation studies and proteomic analyses in animal models, with studies by Qaisar et al., Lengle et al., Silva-Rojas et al., and Eckhardt et al. providing detailed functional readouts that directly link defects in calcium handling to muscle degeneration.
