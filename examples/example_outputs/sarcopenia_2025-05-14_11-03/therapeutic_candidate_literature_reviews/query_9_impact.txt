Query: Impact of mitochondrial calcium uptake via the MCU complex on muscle bioenergetics and contractile impairment in sarcopenia: evidence from aged human myotubes and animal models demonstrating mitochondrial Ca2+ dysregulation, ROS production, bioenergetic deficits

Mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake via the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex is central to skeletal muscle bioenergetics. The MCU facilitates Ca²⁺ entry into the mitochondrial matrix, which is critical for stimulating dehydrogenases in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and thereby enhancing ATP production and oxidative phosphorylation. In skeletal muscle cells, this process ensures that energy production is tightly matched to the high metabolic demands of contraction (carraro2020thirtyyearsof pages 9-10).

In aged human myotubes and animal models, dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake has emerged as a key contributor to sarcopenia. Diminished MCU function leads to impaired Ca²⁺ entry, which consequently reduces the activation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases. This reduction directly compromises ATP synthesis and shifts substrate utilization from glucose oxidation toward fatty acid oxidation. Such metabolic rewiring not only decreases bioenergetic efficiency but also contributes to muscle fatigue and contractile impairments (dong2025effectsofaging pages 10-11, li2025regulationofcalcium pages 8-9).

A significant mechanistic consequence of reduced mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake is the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under normal conditions, mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake through the MCU complex stimulates not only energy production but also influences mitochondrial redox balance. However, when mitochondrial Ca²⁺ homeostasis is disrupted, there is an imbalance in electron transport that leads to excessive electron leakage and ROS production. Elevated ROS levels further damage mitochondrial proteins, lipids, and DNA. This oxidative stress exacerbates bioenergetic deficits and impairs contractile function in skeletal muscle, which is a hallmark of sarcopenia (weiser2022mitochondrialcalciumuniporter pages 119-122, michelucci2021alteredca2+handling pages 4-5).

Moreover, the MCU complex itself contains redox-sensitive elements – for instance, a critical thiol group (cysteine-97) becomes oxidized under conditions of stress, enhancing activity in a way that further modulates mitochondrial redox state. Although controlled MCU activation can support metabolic function by creating a more reduced mitochondrial environment, chronic or excessive activation in aged muscle may trigger a vicious cycle of ROS overproduction that compounds energy deficits (weiser2022mitochondrialcalciumuniportera pages 26-29).

Animal model studies have been instrumental in demonstrating that loss-of-function or decreased expression of MCU and its regulatory subunits (such as MCUR1) leads to notable reductions in mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake. These changes have been correlated with diminished oxidative phosphorylation, increased sensitivity to mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), altered muscle fiber morphology, and decreased muscle mass and strength. Specifically, interventions that impair MCU function yield metabolic shifts that predispose muscle cells to atrophy and contractile impairment, replicating the biophenotypic characteristics observed in sarcopenia (karam2017absenceofphysiological pages 17-18, weiser2022mitochondrialcalciumuniporter pages 83-87).

Furthermore, a growing body of evidence from both aged human myotubes and rodent models suggests that the restoration of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake using targeted strategies—such as the application of bioactive compounds like oleuropein aglycone—can ameliorate these dysfunctions. Oleuropein directly enhances MCU-mediated Ca²⁺ uptake, which in turn improves mitochondrial oxygen consumption and reduces muscle fatigue, offering potential therapeutic insights into countering the bioenergetic and contractile deficits associated with sarcopenia (weiser2022mitochondrialcalciumuniportera pages 91-95).

Collectively, these findings underscore that proper MCU function is pivotal for maintaining muscle bioenergetics and contractile integrity. The dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake observed in aged human myotubes and animal models leads to increased ROS production, metabolic inefficiencies, and ultimately contributes to the progression of sarcopenia (carraro2020thirtyyearsof pages 9-10, dong2025effectsofaging pages 10-11).
