Query: Molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulated calcium homeostasis in aged human skeletal muscle: transcriptomic, proteomic, and post-translational modification studies of SERCA, RyR1, STIM/Orai, mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter in patient-derived myotubes correlated with sarcopenia severity

Dysregulated Ca2+ homeostasis in aged human skeletal muscle is multifactorially driven by alterations in the expression, function, and post‐translational modification of key Ca2+ handling proteins including SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase), RyR1 (ryanodine receptor type 1), the STIM/Orai complex mediating store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), and the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU). In healthy muscle, SERCA clears Ca2+ from the cytosol to promote relaxation following contraction, while RyR1 mediates rapid Ca2+ release during excitation–contraction (EC) coupling; STIM/Orai channels ensure sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ refilling during prolonged activity, and MCU facilitates mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake to regulate energy production.

Oxidative stress, a common feature of aging, alters these proteins through specific post-translational modifications. SERCA, for example, is susceptible to oxidative modifications that diminish its ATPase activity and consequent Ca2+ reuptake capacity, leading to prolonged cytosolic Ca2+ elevation. Although proteomic and transcriptomic studies from patient-derived myotubes have not yet provided robust direct evidence correlating SERCA changes with sarcopenia severity, mechanistic insights from biochemical analyses strongly implicate SERCA oxidation as a contributor to impaired Ca2+ clearance.

Similarly, RyR1 experiences oxidative post-translational modifications such as S-nitrosylation and S-glutathionylation. These modifications destabilize the closed state of the channel by promoting the dissociation of its stabilizing accessory protein FKBP12, thereby increasing SR Ca2+ leak. The resultant Ca2+ leak not only impairs the fidelity of EC coupling but also contributes to intracellular Ca2+ imbalance—a state linked to muscle weakness and fiber atrophy observed in sarcopenia. (michelucci2021alteredca2+handling pages 8-9)

The STIM/Orai complex, essential for SOCE, is also affected in aged muscle. Alterations in either the expression or the function of STIM1 and Orai1 can disrupt the coordinated entry of extracellular Ca2+ to replenish SR stores. Although several studies point to either a compensatory upregulation or oxidative impairment of these proteins, direct transcriptomic and proteomic studies in patient-derived myotubes have not yet conclusively linked these changes with sarcopenia severity, indicating a critical gap in current research. (michelucci2021alteredca2+handling pages 4-5)

Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake via the Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) is equally crucial, as it fine-tunes cellular metabolism by regulating enzymatic activity during muscle contraction. In aged skeletal muscle, decreased efficiency or altered regulation of MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake can lead to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. This overload triggers excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thereby creating a damaging feedback loop that further compromises mitochondrial integrity and function. Yet, like the other key proteins, robust omics-based evidence directly correlating altered MCU expression or modification patterns in patient-derived myotubes with sarcopenia severity is currently sparse. (michelucci2021alteredca2+handling pages 5-7)

Collectively, the molecular pathology of sarcopenia appears to involve a confluence of impaired SERCA function (via reduced expression/activity and oxidative modifications), leaky and oxidatively-modified RyR1 channels, and compromised SOCE due to aberrations in the STIM/Orai system, all compounded by dysfunctional mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. The current literature, primarily derived from animal models and biochemical analyses, underscores these interconnected mechanisms as central to the development of muscle weakness and atrophy associated with sarcopenia. However, comprehensive transcriptomic, proteomic, and post-translational modification profiling in patient-derived myotubes remains an unmet need, with current datasets offering only limited direct evidence for these specific changes correlating with clinical sarcopenia severity.
