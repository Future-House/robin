Query: What are the emerging contractile function assays for aged skeletal muscle cells—such as impedance-based measurements, traction force microscopy, high-throughput optogenetic or electrical stimulation—and how do these technologies correlate with calcium transient amplitude, kinetics, and fatigue profiles in sarcopenia models?

Impedance‐based measurements, traction force microscopy (TFM), and high‐throughput optogenetic/electrical stimulation comprise the forefront of emerging contractile function assays for aged skeletal muscle cells. These methodologies allow for quantitative, real‐time assessments of muscle contractility while providing insights into the underlying calcium handling dynamics that are critical in sarcopenia models.

Impedance‐based assays rely on monitoring changes in electrical resistance during muscle contraction. Using interdigitated electrodes or multiwell MEA platforms, these systems detect subtle shifts in impedance that correspond with cell motion and morphological changes during contraction. Although most applications have been validated in cardiomyocytes, the translation to aged skeletal muscle models is feasible because the same principle captures alterations in contractile strength as well as changes in calcium-dependent excitation–contraction coupling. Notably, these devices can be integrated with automated systems for high‐throughput screening and allow simultaneous measurement of electrical field potentials and associated mechanical outputs – parameters that have been correlated with reduced calcium transient amplitude and prolonged relaxation kinetics observed in sarcopenia (Plakhotnik2023Clinicallyrelevantmodels pages 34-36, Boschi2024Highsensitivitylabelfree pages 21-24).

Traction force microscopy, in contrast, is a mechanical assay that quantifies cellular forces by measuring the deformations of compliant substrates, and has been particularly adapted for isolated muscle fibers embedded within biopolymer matrices. This method exploits known mechanical properties (e.g., Young’s modulus) and geometric parameters (fiber length, diameter) to reconstruct the contractile forces generated during stimulation. Importantly, studies have shown that the force output reconstructed via high-speed TFM correlates strongly with the filtered calcium signals, indicating that calcium transient amplitude and kinetics directly impact muscle activation dynamics. In sarcopenia models, diminished calcium transient magnitudes and delayed kinetics typically result in lower contractile forces and prolonged relaxation times – findings that are measurable through TFM (Rausch2020Measurementofskeletal pages 15-16, Rausch2020Measurementofskeletal pages 16-19).

High-throughput optogenetic and electrical stimulation platforms further complement these mechanical assays by offering precise and scalable control over muscle activation. These systems allow for the systematic evaluation of contraction parameters, including maximum force generation, baseline force, contraction velocity, and fatigue profiles. When aged or cytokine-treated (e.g., TNF-α) muscle tissues are stimulated, high-frequency protocols reveal deficits in contractile output that correlate with alterations in calcium transient dynamics. Specifically, decreased twitch force and increased relaxation times correlate with impaired calcium reuptake and reduced transient amplitude, hallmark features of muscle aging and sarcopenia. Integration of these stimulation modalities with real-time imaging – whether via fluorescent calcium indicators or video-based motion analysis – permits a simultaneous readout of both mechanical contraction and intracellular calcium handling (Mestre20203Dprinteddrugtesting pages 11-14, Mestre20213DBioengineeredmodelof pages 11-14, Sanchez2022Organotypicculturesas pages 15-17).

Collectively, these emerging contractile function assays provide a comprehensive framework to assess aged skeletal muscle function. Impedance-based measurements offer scalable, label-free electrical readouts that reflect contractility, TFM yields direct quantification of force output in relation to calcium-activated mechanisms, and high-throughput optogenetic/electrical stimulation systems enable detailed analysis of fatigue profiles and contraction kinetics. The convergence of these technologies supports robust correlations between the mechanical parameters (force generation, contraction and relaxation times, fatigue) and the physiological underpinnings of calcium transient amplitude and kinetics, which are critical for understanding and evaluating sarcopenia models (Douania2022Multiscalesmultiphysicspersonalized pages 62-65, Plakhotnik2023Clinicallyrelevantmodels pages 150-153, Mestre20203Dprinteddrugtesting pages 11-14).
