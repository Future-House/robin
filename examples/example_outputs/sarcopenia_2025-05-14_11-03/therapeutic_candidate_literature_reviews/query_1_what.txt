Query: What are the optimal protocols and reagents for establishing a high-throughput fluorescent or luminescent calcium transient assay in aged human skeletal myotubes, including dye selection, genetically encoded Ca²⁺ sensor optimization, automation integration, assay sensitivity, dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratio, and reproducibility metrics?

The optimal approach to establishing a high‐throughput fluorescent or luminescent calcium transient assay in aged human skeletal myotubes requires careful selection and optimization of both the calcium indicator (whether a fluorescent dye or a genetically encoded sensor) and the assay’s technical framework. This is achieved through precise reagent selection, sensor engineering to maximize dynamic range and signal-to-noise characteristics, and integration with automated platforms that ensure reproducibility.

For dye selection and sensor choice, two primary strategies exist. When employing luminescent assays, aequorin‐based probes are highly attractive. Aequorin’s dynamic range can be tuned via mutations (e.g., 2mutAEQ for millimolar sensitivity) and by selecting specific coelenterazine analogs (such as variants n and i) to modulate Ca²⁺ affinity and light output. This approach has been detailed for high‐throughput screening using multiwell plate readers and automated injection of discharging solutions to achieve rigorous calibration and consistent counts per second readouts (feno2019highthroughputscreeningusing pages 4-6, feno2019highthroughputscreeningusing pages 11-13).

Alternatively, for fluorescent assays, genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) offer advantages in long-term, non-invasive, and cell-type-specific Ca²⁺ detection. Prior studies have employed GCaMP6f controlled by the muscle‐specific MHCK7 promoter for human muscle microtissues, yielding robust ΔF/F₀ responses that increase with culture maturation and validate sensor performance with pharmacological agents (d-tubocurarine for ACh receptor validation) (afshar2020a96wellculture pages 5-7). More recent sensor developments, such as the jGCaMP8 series, provide ultra-fast kinetics with high baseline brightness and improved dynamic range while maintaining excellent signal-to-noise ratios (looger2023fastandsensitive pages 1-2, day‐cooney2023geneticallyencodedfluorescent pages 6-7). This sensor optimization must account for kinetics (rise and decay times), brightness, and photostability, which are critical parameters when translating these tools for use in aged myotubes.

Automation integration is essential for high-throughput scalability and uniformity across wells. The use of 96-well platforms—like the MyoTACTIC culture system—paired with temperature-controlled (37 °C) environments and automated liquid handlers (such as onboard injectors in EnVision™ multilabel plate readers) permits real-time monitoring and reproducible stimulation protocols (afshar2020a96wellculture pages 5-7, feno2019highthroughputscreeningusing pages 8-11). In addition, implementing semi-automated image analysis pipelines (e.g., Python-based scripts or segmentation tools as outlined in related fluorescence studies) minimizes human error and improves quantification consistency (zhang2021fastandsensitive pages 12-14).

Assay sensitivity, dynamic range, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are largely governed by the careful tuning of sensor affinity and brightness. For aequorin-based assays, using optimized coelenterazine derivatives and achieving complete discharge through control injections (digitonin, high Ca²⁺) enhances calibration and minimizes background noise (feno2019highthroughputscreeningusing pages 13-14). For fluorescent sensors, ensuring stable genetic incorporation via muscle-specific promoters, and validating responsiveness by eliciting both spontaneous and evoked Ca²⁺ transients (e.g., via electrical field stimulation), are critical steps (afshar2020a96wellculture pages 5-7, day‐cooney2023geneticallyencodedfluorescent pages 6-7).

Reproducibility metrics are maintained by rigorous standardization of cell seeding, buffer formulation (maintaining physiological pH and ion composition), and controlled imaging conditions. Quality control methodologies include using pharmacological antagonists for receptor specificity, automated calibration protocols, and statistical validation of signal parameters (ΔF/F₀, kinetics, SNR) across multiple replicates (feno2019highthroughputscreeningusing pages 11-13, fernandezpuente2021geneticallyencodedbiosensors pages 16-17).

In summary, the optimal protocols involve: selecting and engineering either aequorin-based or fluorescent GECIs with appropriate modifications for dynamic range and fast kinetics; integrating robust automation through multiwell platforms and automated liquid handling; ensuring assay sensitivity and low background by precise calibration and environmental control; and finally, applying stringent reproducibility measures via standardized transfection, imaging, and data analysis protocols (afshar2020a96wellculture pages 5-7, feno2019highthroughputscreeningusing pages 8-11, looger2023fastandsensitive pages 1-2).
