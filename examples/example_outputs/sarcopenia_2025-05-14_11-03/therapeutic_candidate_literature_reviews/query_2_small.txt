Query: Small-molecule modulators of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) activity in aged human skeletal muscle: evidence of efficacy in restoring impaired calcium transients and force generation in aged myotubes or disease-relevant animal models, target engagement assays, ADME and safety profiles

Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that small-molecule SERCA modulators can restore calcium handling and improve muscle function in disease-relevant animal models, but current data from aged human skeletal muscle or human myotube models remain lacking. In aged mouse models, for example, pharmacological activation of SERCA using the allosteric activator CDN1163 restored SERCA activity, reduced cytosolic Ca2+ overload, and improved force generation in isolated muscles. These studies provide indirect proof‐of‐concept that small-molecule modulation of SERCA can ameliorate age-related impairments in calcium transients and muscle strength (qaisar2020restorationofsarcoplasmic pages 1-2, qaisar2020restorationofsarcoplasmic pages 7-8).

In the context of aging, CDN1163 has been administered chronically to older mice (16 to 26 months old) and resulted in maintained SERCA function, prevention of muscle atrophy (notably in the gastrocnemius), and enhanced contractile force. Transcriptomic analyses further revealed activation of signaling pathways related to mitochondrial biogenesis and energy production (through PGC1-α, UCP1, and AMPK) along with suppression of stress-related pathways (such as p38 MAPK), which may collectively contribute to improved muscle function (qaisar2020restorationofsarcoplasmic pages 5-7). Similar beneficial outcomes have been reported in dystrophic mdx mice—used as a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy—that also exhibit disrupted calcium homeostasis. In mdx models, CDN1163 reduced cytosolic Ca2+ levels in myotubes and muscles, alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction, and substantially improved functional outcomes when muscle damage was induced by exercise (nogami2021pharmacologicalactivationof pages 13-13, nogami2021pharmacologicalactivationof pages 2-3).

Regarding target engagement, the evidence suggests that these modulators work via allosteric mechanisms directly enhancing SERCA ATPase activity, as seen by biochemical assays demonstrating shifts in Ca2+ affinity and increases in maximal enzymatic activity in SR membrane preparations. In dystrophic muscle tissues, these compounds decreased markers of Ca2+ overload and reduced oxidative stress, suggesting effective target engagement at both the biochemical and cellular levels (nogami2021pharmacologicalactivationof pages 2-2, nogami2021pharmacologicalactivationof pages 3-3). Time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays have also been used in cardiac SR systems to monitor changes in SERCA–phospholamban interactions, although similar studies in skeletal muscle or aged human myotubes have not been extensively reported (stroik2018astudyof pages 61-64).

In terms of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) as well as safety profiles, the current excerpts do not provide comprehensive data. Most of the studies focus on functional and molecular outcomes in mouse models and in vitro preparations, and while pharmacological effects of small-molecule SERCA activators have been demonstrated, details on systemic pharmacokinetics or long-term safety in humans remain to be elucidated. This gap underscores the need for further preclinical and clinical studies to fully assess the translational potential of these compounds (qaisar2020restorationofsarcoplasmic pages 11-13, kho2023targetingcalciumregulators pages 2-3).

In summary, there is robust preclinical evidence from aged and disease-relevant rodent models that small-molecule SERCA activators such as CDN1163 restore impaired calcium transients and improve force generation by rebalancing calcium homeostasis and mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction. However, direct data on aged human skeletal muscle and human myotube models are not available from the current literature, and critical details regarding target engagement assays beyond biochemical readouts, as well as full ADME and safety profiles, remain unreported (qaisar2020restorationofsarcoplasmic pages 7-8, nogami2021pharmacologicalactivationof pages 8-9).
