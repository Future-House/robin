Query: Repurposed clinically approved compounds with skeletal muscle calcium-modulatory properties: preclinical, in vitro myotube, and human safety data for small molecules impacting store-operated calcium entry (STIM/Orai), TRPC channels, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, and their effects on muscle aging or atrophy endpoints

The available literature reveals several examples of repurposed, clinically approved compounds that exert calcium‐modulatory actions in skeletal muscle, although a definitive body of clinical trial data is still lacking. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov for repurposed drugs in this context returned no registered trials, underscoring the data gap in translating preclinical findings into clinical studies (Clinical Trials Search: repurposed drug AND …).

Preclinical data support the potential benefits of pentoxifylline—a drug traditionally used for vascular disorders—in dystrophic muscle models. In mdx mice, pentoxifylline demonstrated efficacy by targeting abnormal cation channel activity, suggesting that it may modulate calcium entry mechanisms, including those involving TRPC channels and possibly SOCE via STIM/Orai pathways (conte2021alterationofstim1orai1mediated pages 22-23). However, while these findings are promising from a preclinical standpoint, detailed human safety data concerning its use specifically for skeletal muscle atrophy or aging endpoints remains to be established.

Flufenamic acid is another repurposed compound that has been investigated in aged mouse models. Recognized primarily as an anti‐inflammatory agent, it modulates TRP channels and has been shown to reduce muscle calcium concentrations and inflammatory markers in animal studies. This indicates its potential to alleviate calcium dysregulation in aged skeletal muscle, yet its efficacy appears to be age‐dependent and its mechanism centers more on TRP modulation rather than direct action on STIM/Orai or mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake pathways (terrell2023calcium’sroleand pages 9-10). As with pentoxifylline, flufenamic acid’s existing use in musculoskeletal and inflammatory disorders contributes to a known safety profile in humans, although direct evidence linking its calcium‐modulatory effects to muscle aging endpoints in clinical settings is still limited.

In addition to these, specific Orai1 inhibitors have been explored in preclinical human cell models. For instance, the compound CM4620 was evaluated in patient‐derived iPSC models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, where inhibition of Orai1–STIM1 channels improved contractile function by reducing pathological Ca2+ overload (uchimura2021orai1–stim1regulatesincreased pages 10-12). This approach is significant because it supports the concept that targeting calcium overload via SOCE inhibition can ameliorate muscle dysfunction. Nevertheless, while CM4620 has clinical-stage relevance in other indications, concrete data regarding its safety and efficacy in the context of muscle atrophy have not been fully delineated.

Another compound of note is the Rycal S48168 (also known as ARM210), which acts as a ryanodine receptor stabilizer. Emerging studies in preclinical models of skeletal muscle aging indicate that Rycal compounds can improve calcium handling and protect against muscle degeneration. Early-phase clinical trials have provided initial safety data for Rycal S48168 in RYR1-related myopathies, indicating its promise as an agent that might be repurposed further to address issues in muscle atrophy (dong2025effectsofaging pages 17-17).

Furthermore, bioactive natural compounds such as curcumin, oleuropein, and catechins have been shown to improve mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and modulate calcium channels in aging muscle models (dong2025effectsofaging pages 11-12). Although these compounds originate from nutritional studies and have a well-established safety profile, they are not yet formally categorized as channel modulators targeting STIM/Orai or TRPC channels in the context of muscle aging.

In summary, while preclinical and in vitro data provide a strong rationale for repurposing clinically approved drugs (e.g., pentoxifylline, flufenamic acid, CM4620, and Rycal S48168) to modulate store-operated calcium entry, TRPC channels, or mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in skeletal muscle, explicit human safety data and efficacy studies in the context of muscle aging or atrophy endpoints remain scarce and warrant further investigation (conte2021alterationofstim1orai1mediated pages 22-23, terrell2023calcium’sroleand pages 9-10, uchimura2021orai1–stim1regulatesincreased pages 10-12, dong2025effectsofaging pages 17-17).
