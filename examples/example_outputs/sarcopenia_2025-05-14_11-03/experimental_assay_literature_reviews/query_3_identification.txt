Query: Identification of key biochemical biomarkers and readouts for high-throughput screening of anti-sarcopenic compounds in cell-based assays, encompassing measurements of muscle protein synthesis rates, degradation markers (MuRF1, Atrogin-1), mitochondrial respiration, ROS levels, and calcium flux

The key biochemical biomarkers and readouts for high-throughput screening of anti‐sarcopenic compounds span multiple dimensions of muscle physiology, including measurements of muscle protein synthesis, markers of protein degradation, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and calcium signaling.

Muscle protein synthesis can be measured indirectly via activation of anabolic pathways, such as the protein kinase B (Akt)/mTOR axis. In cell‐based assays, quantification of nascent peptide incorporation—using labeled amino acids or puromycin incorporation assays—can provide an index of muscle protein synthesis rates. These measurements are essential because impaired protein synthesis contributes to sarcopenia and restoration of anabolic signaling is a desirable effect for candidate compounds (gheller2020metabolicandtranscriptional pages 50-54).

Parallel to these synthesis measures, degradation markers are critical. Two muscle‐specific E3 ubiquitin ligases, MuRF1 and Atrogin‐1, encoded by TRIM63 and FBXO32 respectively, are well‐recognized markers of muscle protein degradation during atrophy. Their mRNA and protein expression levels are inversely correlated with muscle hypertrophy and directly reflect proteolytic activity. Quantitative PCR or immunoassays in cell‐based systems can serve as high-throughput readouts to evaluate whether an anti-sarcopenic compound attenuates the degradative response (OpenTargets Search: sarcopenia-MuRF1,Atrogin-1, gheller2020metabolicandtranscriptional pages 25-29).

Mitochondrial respiration is another pivotal parameter. High-throughput platforms can be integrated with assays that measure the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in muscle cells to assess mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity. Techniques such as the Seahorse XF Analyzer can be deployed to quantitate basal respiration, ATP production, and maximal respiratory capacity. These mitochondrial function metrics are critical since the decline in mitochondrial respiration is associated with impaired energy metabolism in aged muscle, and improvements therein serve as a positive indicator of potential therapeutics (gheller2020metabolicandtranscriptional pages 33-37, gheller2020metabolicandtranscriptional pages 50-54).

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels are an essential readout to monitor oxidative stress, which can exacerbate muscle damage during sarcopenia. Cell-based assays may employ fluorescent probes (e.g., DCFDA) to quantify intracellular ROS, offering an additional layer of information regarding the cellular redox environment. Since many anti-sarcopenic strategies aim to modulate oxidative stress, a reduction in ROS following treatment would be a desirable outcome (gheller2020metabolicandtranscriptional pages 80-84, xia2021theroleof pages 12-13).

Finally, calcium flux measurements provide insight into the excitation–contraction coupling and calcium-mediated signaling pathways in muscle cells. High-throughput screening platforms can utilize calcium-sensitive dyes coupled with live-cell imaging or fluorescence plate readers to monitor transient changes in intracellular calcium. Although the current context does not provide extensive details on specific high-throughput protocols for calcium flux, this parameter is recognized as a critical biomarker given its role in muscle contraction and signal transduction (OpenTargets Search: sarcopenia-MuRF1,Atrogin-1).

Together, these biomarkers and readouts allow a comprehensive assessment of both the anabolic and catabolic aspects of muscle protein homeostasis. They empower researchers to detect subtle modulations in muscle cell physiology and to screen candidate compounds that can either boost protein synthesis, reduce proteolysis, improve mitochondrial function, mitigate oxidative stress, or normalize calcium signaling, all of which are central to counteracting sarcopenia.
