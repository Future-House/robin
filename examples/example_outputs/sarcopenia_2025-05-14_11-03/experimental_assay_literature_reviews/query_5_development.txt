Query: Development of co-culture systems and microphysiological platforms recapitulating muscle–nerve–immune interactions in sarcopenia, leveraging 3D bioprinted muscle constructs, microfluidic perfusion, and real-time imaging to assess neuromuscular junction integrity, inflammatory infiltration, and functional contraction

Recent research has converged on the development of advanced in vitro platforms that combine 3D bioprinted muscle constructs with integrated co-culture systems of muscle, nerve, and immune cells to recapitulate the complex pathophysiology of sarcopenia. (zschuntzsch2022theevolutionof pages 13-14)

At the core of these platforms are 3D bioprinted muscle constructs that utilize bioinks formulated from collagen hydrogels, fibrinogen, Matrigel®, or decellularized extracellular matrix, which provide the requisite structural, mechanical, and biochemical cues for muscle fiber differentiation and maturation. (hidalgoalvarez2024leveragingbiomaterialplatforms pages 17-18) These constructs are designed to mimic the native tissue architecture and support the alignment and contractility of myotubes, serving as a physiologically relevant substrate for subsequent co-culture.

Integration of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology further enhances these systems by enabling the differentiation of patient-derived cells into myocytes, motor neurons, and immune cells, thus ensuring a genetic and phenotypic fidelity that is critical for studying the individualized aspects of sarcopenia. (zschuntzsch2022theevolutionof pages 5-7) Co-culture setups that include PSC-derived motor neurons have been shown to promote neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation, which is crucial for eliciting coordinated contractions and functional muscle responses. (wang2019engineeredskeletalmuscles pages 8-9)

Microfluidic perfusion is incorporated into these platforms to provide a dynamic fluidic environment that ensures adequate nutrient delivery, waste removal, and mimics capillary networks. (hidalgoalvarez2024leveragingbiomaterialplatforms pages 18-20) This perfusion system also enables precise control over biochemical gradients and the manipulation of inflammatory mediators, thereby facilitating the in situ investigation of immune cell infiltration and inflammatory responses during sarcopenia progression.

Real-time imaging modalities are paired with these microphysiological systems to allow continuous, high-resolution monitoring of several key parameters, including NMJ integrity, muscle contractile dynamics, and immune cell interactions. (hidalgoalvarez2024leveragingbiomaterialplatforms pages 20-21) These imaging approaches provide quantitative assessments of contraction force, calcium handling, and receptor clustering at NMJs, offering critical insights into both functional performance and pathological deterioration of muscle tissue.

The inclusion of immune components, such as macrophages and T cells, into these co-culture systems further extends their utility by capturing the multifaceted interactions that contribute to sarcopenia. (zschuntzsch2022theevolutionof pages 10-12) The immune cells, when introduced into these engineered platforms, generate inflammatory conditions that can mimic the in vivo environment of aged muscle, enabling detailed studies on how immune-mediated inflammation exacerbates muscle degeneration and NMJ dysfunction. (zschuntzsch2022theevolutionof pages 12-13)

Clinical investigations such as those described in NCT00926250 and NCT05525039 underscore the translational relevance of these engineered systems by focusing on endpoints related to muscle mass, strength, NMJ integrity, and inflammatory profiles in sarcopenic patients. (NCT00926250) While neither clinical trial directly utilizes 3D bioprinted constructs or microfluidic systems, the endpoints targeted provide essential validation criteria for the development of these advanced in vitro platforms. (NCT05525039)

Collectively, these integrated microphysiological platforms—leveraging state-of-the-art 3D bioprinting techniques, microfluidic perfusion systems, and real-time imaging—offer a robust, high-fidelity model for recapitulating muscle–nerve–immune interactions in sarcopenia. (Clinical Trials Search: sarcopenia OR muscle degeneration AND 3D bioprinting OR microphysiological OR coculture OR microfluidic OR neuromuscular junction OR immune) They not only facilitate a fundamental understanding of the complex cellular interplay underlying sarcopenia but also serve as a powerful platform for screening potential therapeutic interventions in a controlled yet physiologically relevant setting.
