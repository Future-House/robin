Query: Comprehensive overview of molecular and cellular pathways driving age-related skeletal muscle atrophy, including satellite cell dysfunction, proteostasis imbalance via ubiquitin–proteasome and autophagy–lysosome systems, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory cytokine signaling, anabolic resistance, and neuromuscular junction degeneration

Age-related skeletal muscle atrophy (sarcopenia) is driven by a multifactorial disruption of interconnected molecular and cellular pathways. One central mechanism is satellite cell dysfunction. Satellite cells, defined as muscle stem cells typically marked by Pax7 expression, are responsible for muscle regeneration. With aging, these cells exhibit reduced proliferative and self-renewal capacities, partly due to chronic activation of stress signals such as p38α/β and the upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p16Ink4a and p21Cip1) that drive cellular senescence. This intrinsic impairment is compounded by extrinsic changes in the muscle niche, including altered cytokine profiles and dysregulated growth factor signaling, which further limit the regenerative potential of satellite cells (aversa2019theclinicalimpact pages 4-5, sharma2024targetingcrosstalkof pages 3-5).

Concomitantly, proteostasis imbalance plays a crucial role in muscle atrophy through both decreased protein synthesis and accelerated protein degradation. Under physiological conditions, the balance between anabolic pathways (primarily the IGF‑1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis) and catabolic processes is tightly regulated. However, in aging muscle, anabolic resistance blunts mTORC1 activation in response to growth stimuli, resulting in reduced protein synthesis. On the degradation side, dysregulation occurs through two major proteolytic systems. The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) is hyperactive in atrophic conditions, with muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases such as MuRF1 and atrogin‑1 (MAFbx) being upregulated in response to de-repressed activity of transcription factors like FoxO. Simultaneously, the autophagy–lysosome pathway, essential for clearing damaged proteins and organelles, becomes impaired, as indicated by aberrant expression of key markers like LC3 and p62, leading to an accumulation of dysfunctional proteins and organelles (lal2021structuralfunctionaland pages 43-46, aversa2019theclinicalimpact pages 4-5).

Mitochondrial dysfunction further exacerbates the atrophic process. Aging is associated with ineffective mitophagy and impaired mitochondrial biogenesis, which result in the accumulation of damaged mitochondria that generate excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS). This oxidative stress not only damages mitochondrial DNA and proteins but also sets in motion apoptotic signaling pathways, thereby depleting muscle fiber integrity and energy capacity (canfora2022metabolicpathwaysand pages 4-5, gorza2021masterregulatorsof pages 21-23).

Inflammatory cytokine signaling is another major contributor to sarcopenia. Chronic, low-grade inflammation—or “inflammaging”—is characterized by elevated levels of cytokines such as TNF‑α, IL‑6, and IL‑1. These cytokines activate catabolic pathways including NF‑κB and STAT3, which in turn promote the transcription of ubiquitin ligases and other proteolytic components, intensifying muscle protein degradation. Furthermore, this inflammatory milieu can inhibit anabolic signaling pathways, thereby reinforcing anabolic resistance in aged muscle (nevi2023targetingepigeneticregulators pages 15-16, sharma2024targetingcrosstalkof pages 3-5).

Anabolic resistance itself, defined as the reduced capacity of aged muscle to stimulate protein synthesis in response to anabolic stimuli such as nutrients and exercise, is mediated by impaired sensitivity of the IGF‑1/insulin receptor signaling cascade. Reduced Akt activation leads to insufficient mTORC1 signaling and unchecked activation of FoxO, resulting in enhanced expression of atrophy‐related genes. This blunted responsiveness to anabolic cues is a hallmark of sarcopenia (wang2025sarcopeniaandcachexia pages 2-4, aversa2019theclinicalimpact pages 3-4).

Finally, neuromuscular junction (NMJ) degeneration plays a vital role in the progressive loss of muscle mass and functional strength. Structural and functional decline of the NMJ impairs neuromuscular transmission, thereby contributing to muscle fiber denervation and subsequent atrophy. The degradation of NMJ integrity is influenced by upstream factors such as oxidative stress, impaired proteostasis, and chronic inflammation, culminating in compromised muscle performance (wang2025sarcopeniaandcachexia pages 4-5, sorge2021masterregulatorsof pages 21-23).

Collectively, these pathways—satellite cell dysfunction, proteostasis imbalance, mitochondrial impairment, inflammatory cytokine-mediated catabolism, anabolic resistance, and NMJ degeneration—interact dynamically to drive the progression of sarcopenia. An intricate understanding of these mechanisms is critical for the design of targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving muscle mass and function in the aging population (aversa2019theclinicalimpact pages 4-5, lal2021structuralfunctionaland pages 43-46).
