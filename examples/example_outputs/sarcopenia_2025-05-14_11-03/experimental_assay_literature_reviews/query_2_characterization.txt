Query: Characterization of in vitro cell culture models for sarcopenia research, focusing on primary human myoblasts, C2C12 myotubes, and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myofibers, detailing differentiation protocols, phenotypic readouts, morphological markers, contractility assays, and replicative senescence induction

Primary human myoblasts are isolated from skeletal muscle satellite cells and represent a physiologically relevant in vitro model for studying sarcopenia. These cells, obtained either directly or via sorting techniques such as FACS or MACS (using surface markers like CD56/NCAM), retain much of the heterogeneity and myogenic potential found in vivo (francis2025insightsintohuman pages 1-2, romagnoli2021availableinvitro pages 2-4). Differentiation protocols typically involve expanding the cells in growth media until they reach confluence, followed by a switch to low-serum or differentiation media. This induces fusion into multinucleated myotubes, characterized by the expression of key markers such as MyoD, myogenin, desmin, and myosin heavy chain (MHC) (romagnoli2021availableinvitro pages 2-4). Morphological readouts, including the fusion index, myotube diameter, and alignment, are critical for assessing differentiation status. In addition, primary myoblast cultures allow for the monitoring of anabolic and catabolic signaling pathways—including alterations in Akt/mTORC1 activity and upregulation of ubiquitin ligases like Atrogin-1 and MuRF1—that are implicated in muscle atrophy and sarcopenia (allen2022sarcopeniainchronic pages 71-75).

The C2C12 murine myoblast cell line is a well-established model that offers high reproducibility and ease of culture. When cultured under low-serum conditions after reaching confluence, C2C12 myoblasts synchronously exit the cell cycle and fuse to form myotubes, which are then characterized by robust myogenic marker expression (e.g., MyoD and MHC) and a clearly quantifiable fusion index (antoun2018molecularandepigenetic pages 176-182, romagnoli2021availableinvitro pages 13-14). Morphological assessments typically include measurements of myotube diameter and the degree of alignment of sarcomeric structures. Functional assays, although less standardized, often employ electrical or mechanical stimulation to evaluate contractility. This is an important parameter, as it enables the correlation of structural maturation with muscle functionality (mehmood2024aligningwiththe pages 15-15, romagnoli2021availableinvitro pages 7-8). To model senescence or muscle atrophy in vitro, C2C12 cultures are subjected to treatments such as dexamethasone, which reduces myotube diameter by approximately 40% and modulates both protein synthesis and degradation pathways, or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to induce oxidative stress (allen2022sarcopeniainchronic pages 55-59). Furthermore, replicative senescence can be experimentally induced by telomerase inhibition using compounds like SYUIQ-5. Such treatment leads to increased p21 expression, p53 phosphorylation, senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, nuclear γ-H2AX foci, and elevated myostatin secretion—exhibiting a sarcopenic-like phenotype (gerosa2024murinemyoblastsexposed pages 1-1, gerosa2024murinemyoblastsexposed pages 8-9).

Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived myofibers have emerged as a promising model that offers patient-specific insights. Differentiation protocols for iPSC-derived myogenic progenitors often mimic embryonic myogenesis, employing directed differentiation approaches through the temporal modulation of key transcription factors (e.g., MYOD1, PAX7) and growth factors (barakat2024inhibitionofmetalloproteinases pages 2-3, tey2024cellularandtranscriptomic pages 14-15). While these protocols are still being refined, the resulting iPSC-derived myofibers can form mature, contractile muscle fibers. Characterization of these cells includes immunostaining for markers reflective of different myogenic stages, quantification of fusion index and myotube morphology, as well as the execution of contractility assays under electrical or mechanical stimulation. Although the current literature provides fewer detailed protocols for iPSC-derived myofibers compared to primary cells or C2C12 models, their capacity for scalable production and genetic fidelity makes them particularly attractive for modeling the multifactorial aspects of sarcopenia (romagnoli2021availableinvitro pages 7-8, tey2024cellularandtranscriptomic pages 14-15).

In summary, each of these in vitro models provides distinct advantages: primary human myoblasts offer high physiological relevance with robust phenotypic fidelity; C2C12 cells provide ease of manipulation, rapid screening of sarcopenic conditions, and well-established differentiation and contractility protocols; and iPSC-derived myofibers hold significant promise for patient-specific and high-throughput studies. Together, these models allow comprehensive investigation into the molecular mechanisms of muscle atrophy, the impact of aging on muscle regeneration, and the testing of potential therapeutic interventions targeting sarcopenia (allen2022sarcopeniainchronic pages 71-75, antoun2018molecularandepigenetic pages 176-182, gerosa2024murinemyoblastsexposed pages 8-9).
