Query: Identification and characterization of primary human trabecular meshwork cell culture models and immortalized retinal ganglion cell lines, including cell isolation protocols, culture media compositions, phenotype validation markers, and model applicability to high-throughput drug screening assays for glaucoma

Primary human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cell culture models use rigorous isolation and characterization procedures to ensure their physiological relevance for glaucoma research and high-throughput drug screening. HTM cells are typically isolated from donated human ocular tissue, often using corneoscleral rims or anterior segments from donor eyes. Isolation protocols involve careful dissection of the trabecular meshwork followed by enzymatic digestion (commonly with collagenase) to release viable cells, and the use of either mechanical or fluorescence‐based (e.g., FACS) methods to enrich the population. It is imperative that these cells are used within a limited passage number—often before passage 7—to prevent phenotypic drift (Buffault2023anoverviewof pages 5-9, Tian2020abiomimeticstem pages 3-4).

Culture media for primary HTM cells are generally serum-containing; most protocols employ a basal medium such as DMEM or Improved MEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum (typically around 10%) along with antibiotics, and sometimes additional growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to support cell adhesion and proliferation. Advances in culture technologies have led to the development of three-dimensional (3D) systems. These include embedding cells in hydrogels (e.g., Matrigel) or seeding them on engineered porous scaffolds (e.g., SU-8 membranes or collagen scaffolds) with controlled pore architecture, which better replicate the in vivo extracellular matrix (ECM) and fluid dynamics. Such 3D culture systems have demonstrated improved recapitulation of native HTM cellular behavior and ECM deposition (Buffault2023anoverviewof pages 23-26, Vernazza20192dand3dcultures pages 14-15).

Phenotypic validation of HTM cells relies on a combination of molecular and functional assays. Key molecular markers include myocilin—a protein whose expression is upregulated in response to glucocorticoids like dexamethasone—along with alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and various ECM components such as fibronectin and collagen type IV. Additional markers, including matrix metalloproteinases and other proteins (e.g., caveolin-1, TIMP3, and collagen IV alpha 5), are used to further confirm the trabecular identity of the cells. Functional assays, such as phagocytosis measurements and assessments of outflow facility, are often incorporated to validate physiological responses consistent with native tissue behavior (Buffault2023anoverviewof pages 1-5, Buffault2023anoverviewof pages 28-31, Feng2023applicationofa pages 12-13).

High-throughput drug screening is increasingly accommodating these HTM models. The transition from traditional two-dimensional cultures to more physiologically relevant 3D systems—often integrated with microfluidic or milli-fluidic perfusion platforms—allows for the quantification of drug-induced changes in outflow resistance, ECM remodeling, and cell viability. Furthermore, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived TM-like cells have been developed with protocols that closely mimic the differentiation and phenotype of primary HTM cells, thereby providing a scalable and consistent cell source for drug screening applications (Buffault2023anoverviewof pages 28-31, Fan2021replacementofthe pages 15-17).

Regarding immortalized retinal ganglion cell (RGC) lines, the context indicates that immortalized human TM cells have been generated via viral transformation (e.g., using SV40 mutants) to mitigate limited cell lifespan. However, the available literature does not provide detailed protocols, specific culture media compositions, or comprehensive phenotypic validation markers for immortalized RGC lines in the context of glaucoma research. Although such RGC lines are recognized as valuable for developing neuroprotective and functional assays in glaucoma, further characterization and standardization are needed to match the extensive validation frameworks established for HTM models (Buffault2023anoverviewof pages 5-9).

In summary, primary HTM cell culture models are well defined with respect to isolation protocols, serum-based and advanced 3D culture systems, and robust phenotypic and functional validations using markers like myocilin and α-SMA. These models are particularly applicable to high-throughput drug screening platforms aimed at glaucoma therapies. In contrast, while immortalization strategies exist for glaucoma-related cell types, detailed protocols for immortalized retinal ganglion cell lines remain sparse in the current literature, highlighting an area that warrants further research (Buffault2023anoverviewof pages 5-9, Tian2020abiomimeticstem pages 3-4).
