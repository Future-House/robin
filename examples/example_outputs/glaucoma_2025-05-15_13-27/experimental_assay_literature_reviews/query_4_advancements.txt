Query: Advancements in high-content screening, live-cell imaging, and quantitative cytometry methods for assessing trabecular meshwork cell physiology, cytoskeletal dynamics, extracellular matrix remodeling, and cellular biomechanics under pharmacological interventions targeting intraocular pressure reduction in glaucoma preclinical assays

Recent advancements in high‐content screening (HCS), live‐cell imaging, and quantitative cytometry have significantly improved our ability to assess trabecular meshwork (TM) cell physiology, cytoskeletal dynamics, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and overall cellular biomechanics under pharmacological interventions aimed at reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma. These methods integrate dynamic mechanical stimulation with molecular and imaging endpoints to provide robust, multiparametric readouts.

HCS platforms now combine automated image acquisition with advanced data analysis, enabling simultaneous monitoring of TM cell responses to pharmacological agents in real time. For example, coupling live‐cell imaging modalities with Flexcell® Tension Systems permits controlled application of cyclic or static mechanical strain (up to 21.8% equiaxial strain) in conjunction with live visualization of cellular morphology and cytoskeletal rearrangements. This integration quantifies alterations in cytoskeletal organization—such as the assembly of contractile actomyosin networks—and links these changes to variations in ECM deposition, all of which correlate with dynamic IOP regulation (dammak2024…relacionadoscon pages 108-113, vroemen2019modelingthemechanical pages 10-11).

Biomimetic 3D culture systems represent another critical advance. Traditional two-dimensional models on stiff substrates have been largely supplanted by hydrogels and polymer scaffolds with tunable stiffness that better recapitulate the native TM microenvironment (with physiological stiffness values between 4–80 kPa). In this context, hydrogels and decellularized extracellular matrices foster natural cell polarity, nutrient diffusion, and realistic cell–matrix interactions. The application of these biomaterials in conjunction with live-cell imaging facilitates high-content analysis of TM cell gene expression and mechanical responses when exposed to IOP-lowering drugs (kingston2024utilisingglaucomatousextracellular pages 63-66, kingston2024utilisingglaucomatousextracellular pages 239-243).

Quantitative cytometry has evolved to allow precise measurement of molecular markers that inform on the state of the cytoskeleton and ECM organization. Multiplex assays, such as those employing Luminex® technology, quantify secreted biomarkers like osteopontin, MMP-9, and cytokines simultaneously. These assays can be correlated with imaging data to assess how drug treatments modulate cellular stress responses, ECM remodeling enzymes, and mechanotransduction pathways. This integration is essential to verify that cytoskeletal changes observed during live-cell imaging correspond to molecular shifts measured by cytometry (dammak2024…relacionadoscon pages 272-274, dammak2024…relacionadoscon pages 274-276).

Furthermore, high-content screening methods now include automated high-throughput platforms that apply repetitive mechanical forces to TM cells in multiwell formats. This advancement enables medium- to high-throughput drug screening while maintaining the physiological relevance of the model systems. Automated analysis platforms are coupled with real-time imaging to capture cellular responses—such as changes in cell morphology, contractility, and ECM deposition—that are quantified using advanced cytometric techniques. These methods provide a robust preclinical assay system that simulates the in vivo mechanical environment of TM cells and allows for the fine-tuning of pharmacological interventions aimed at lowering IOP (vroemen2019modelingthemechanical pages 14-15, vroemen2019modelingthemechanical pages 7-7).

In summary, the integration of HCS, live-cell imaging, and quantitative cytometry in TM cell assays is yielding a comprehensive approach that captures not only static molecular endpoints but also dynamic biomechanical and structural changes. These innovations are paving the way toward more predictive and clinically relevant drug discovery platforms for glaucoma, ensuring that alterations in TM cell physiology and ECM behavior are precisely monitored under pharmacological treatment conditions (kingston2024utilisingglaucomatousextracellular pages 33-37, dammak2024…relacionadoscon pages 108-113).
