Query: Comprehensive review of molecular signaling pathways contributing to trabecular meshwork cell homeostasis, extracellular matrix regulation, and intraocular pressure elevation in glaucoma pathogenesis, emphasizing TGF-β, RhoA/ROCK, Wnt, oxidative stress, and fibrotic mechanisms

The trabecular meshwork (TM) is central to the regulation of aqueous humor outflow, and its dysfunction is a hallmark of glaucoma pathogenesis. Multiple interrelated molecular signaling pathways contribute to TM cell homeostasis, extracellular matrix (ECM) regulation, and intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation. Notably, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) acts as a master regulator that initiates fibrotic responses by stimulating ECM protein synthesis and deposition. Elevated TGF-β levels in the TM promote collagen, fibronectin, and other matrix components’ production, leading to an aberrant ECM that increases outflow resistance and IOP (strickland2022remodelingofthe pages 12-13).

Concurrently, the RhoA/ROCK (Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase) signaling pathway is critically involved in modulating TM cell contractility and cytoskeletal dynamics. Activation of RhoA increases ROCK activity, which in turn enhances cellular contractility and stiffness through reorganization of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions. This mechanotransductive response directly contributes to an altered TM architecture and impairs aqueous humor drainage. Pharmacological inhibition of ROCK signaling using agents such as netarsudil or ripasudil has shown promise in reducing TM stiffness, normalizing ECM homeostasis, and lowering IOP (OpenTargets Search: glaucoma-TGF-β,RhoA,ROCK,Wnt).

The Wnt signaling pathway also plays a pivotal role in TM physiology by regulating gene expression related to ECM turnover and cell adhesion. Although its explicit involvement may be less prominent in some datasets compared to TGF-β and RhoA/ROCK, dysregulation in Wnt signaling is thought to contribute to ECM remodeling abnormalities and TM dysfunction in glaucoma (strickland2022remodelingofthe pages 17-18).

Oxidative stress further complicates TM homeostasis by inducing cellular damage and promoting inflammatory and fibrotic responses. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated under oxidative stress conditions can impair TM cell viability and perturb the balance of ECM degradation versus synthesis. This stress-induced pathology not only augments the fibrotic milieu but also synergizes with TGF-β signaling to drive further ECM deposition and resistance to aqueous humor outflow (compagnoni2020studiodellespressionedi pages 21-24).

Fibrotic mechanisms are a downstream consequence of these complex signaling cascades. TGF-β, in particular, activates several intracellular pathways that converge on fibroproliferative responses, including the stimulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and modulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Such fibrotic changes lead to a denser, scar-like ECM that impairs TM flexibility and outflow facility—a critical aspect of increased IOP in glaucoma (strickland2022remodelingofthe pages 10-12).

Importantly, cross-talk among these pathways intensifies the pathological remodeling of the TM. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) emerges as a key modulator, linking mechanical strain to biochemical responses by activating latent TGF-β and interfacing with the calreticulin/LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) axis. The TSP-1-mediated interactions further influence RhoA/ROCK signaling and ECM assembly, contributing to a feed-forward loop that exacerbates TM stiffness and IOP elevation (murphyullrich2022thrombospondin1signalingthrough pages 7-8).

Collectively, the interplay of TGF-β-induced fibrosis, RhoA/ROCK-driven cytoskeletal remodeling, Wnt-mediated ECM regulation, and oxidative stress-induced cellular damage forms a complex network that disrupts TM function. Therapeutic approaches targeting these pathways aim not only to reduce IOP but also to restore TM homeostasis and prevent the progressive optic neuropathy characteristic of glaucoma (strickland2022remodelingofthe pages 1-2, OpenTargets Search: glaucoma-TGF-β,RhoA,ROCK,Wnt).
