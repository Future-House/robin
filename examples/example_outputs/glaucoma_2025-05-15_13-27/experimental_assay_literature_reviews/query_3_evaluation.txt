Query: Evaluation of mechanobiological and inflammatory mechanisms driving ocular hypertension in glaucoma, including the roles of shear stress, extracellular matrix stiffening, cytokine secretion, immune cell infiltration, and cell contractility in modulating aqueous humor outflow resistance, with implications for in vitro assay design

Ocular hypertension in glaucoma is a multifactorial process driven by both mechanobiological and inflammatory mechanisms. The trabecular meshwork (TM) plays a central role in modulating aqueous humor outflow resistance, and its dysfunction is influenced by mechanical stimuli such as shear stress and extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening, as well as by the secretion of cytokines and immune cell infiltration. These factors alter TM cell contractility and ultimately lead to increased intraocular pressure (IOP).

Mechanobiologically, shear stress—generated by the dynamic flow of aqueous humor—induces significant changes in TM cells. This mechanical force affects cell morphology and alignment by promoting the condensation and orientation of actin stress fibers. Under physiological conditions, TM cells respond to shear stress by reconfiguring their cytoskeleton and adjusting focal adhesion dynamics, thereby ensuring proper outflow regulation. In glaucomatous conditions, TM cells exhibit an exaggerated response to shear stress, leading to enhanced stress fiber formation and increased traction forces that contribute to heightened outflow resistance (karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 19-21).

ECM stiffening is another key factor. The ECM in the TM comprises collagens, glycosaminoglycans, and other matrix proteins that determine its mechanical properties. In glaucoma, pathological ECM remodeling—often driven by increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling—results in a marked stiffening of the TM. This increased rigidity changes the cellular microenvironment, altering mechanotransduction pathways such as those mediated by YAP/TAZ and RhoA, which in turn modulate gene expression linked to contractility and fibrosis. The stiffened ECM facilitates stronger cell-matrix adhesion and promotes a myofibroblast-like phenotype in TM cells, further increasing their contractile behavior and reinforcing outflow resistance (zhang2023extracellularmatrixmechanicsregulate pages 2-4, pages 4-6).

Inflammatory mechanisms intersect with these mechanobiological changes. Pro-inflammatory cytokines—such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6—are secreted in response to ECM stiffening and mechanical stress. These cytokines not only enhance the fibrotic response by upregulating ECM proteins and contractile factors but also recruit immune cells to the TM microenvironment. The resulting immune cell infiltration exacerbates local inflammation, perpetuating a cycle of tissue remodeling and further ECM stiffness. Moreover, the inflammatory environment can disrupt normal barrier functions and contribute to additional alterations in cellular contractility, shifting the balance toward increased aqueous humor outflow resistance (zhang2023extracellularmatrixmechanicsregulate pages 9-10, shi2024targetingnox2to pages 36-39).

Cell contractility itself is a central outcome of these processes. Elevated traction forces generated by TM cells under conditions of increased shear stress and ECM stiffening lead to enhanced cellular tension. In glaucomatous eyes, these contractile forces are significantly higher, which not only impairs the ability of the TM to maintain proper outflow channels but also structurally reinforces the stiffened ECM, creating a feedback loop that further elevates IOP (karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 34-35).

The implications for in vitro assay design are significant. To replicate the pathological environment of glaucoma, assay systems must incorporate three-dimensional culture models that mimic the native ECM architecture with tunable stiffness gradients. These models should also include dynamic fluid-structure interactions to apply physiologically relevant shear stress. Moreover, integrating cytokine treatments and immune cell co-cultures can simulate the inflammatory milieu observed in glaucomatous TM. Such comprehensive platforms enable detailed evaluation of TM cell contractility, cytoskeletal dynamics, and mechanotransduction pathways, thereby providing a more accurate means to study aqueous humor outflow resistance and to screen for therapeutic agents that target both the mechanobiological and inflammatory axes of ocular hypertension (karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 17-19, karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 1-3, zhang2023extracellularmatrixmechanicsregulate pages 10-10).
