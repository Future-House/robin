Proposal for Losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Losartan is an orally active small molecule originally developed as an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker (ARB) that is widely used in the management of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. Chemically synthesized as a biphenyl derivative, Losartan belongs to the class of non-peptide ARBs, a category of drugs that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These compounds were designed to selectively antagonize AT1 receptors, thereby inhibiting the vasoconstrictive, proinflammatory, and profibrotic actions of angiotensin II. Losartan’s discovery was driven by the need for antihypertensive agents with a favorable side effect profile compared to older drugs such as ACE inhibitors, with the added advantage that ARBs, including Losartan, do not cause the increased bradykinin levels associated with cough or angioedema. Over the years, its extensive use in cardiovascular medicine has established a robust safety profile and predictable pharmacokinetics, and its known capacity to achieve therapeutic drug levels in various tissues has generated interest in its potential repurposing for other conditions, including ocular diseases like glaucoma (White et al., 2015; Wilson, 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Losartan, as a representative of the ARB family, has a well-documented history in the treatment of systemic hypertension, heart failure, and renal disease. Its use in the cardiovascular arena is supported by numerous large-scale clinical trials that have consistently demonstrated its efficacy in reducing blood pressure and preventing target organ damage. In addition to its systemic roles, preclinical studies have documented its antifibrotic properties in organs such as the kidney and heart, where Losartan has been shown to reduce extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and inhibit transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)–driven fibrosis. Notably, the antifibrotic effects of Losartan have been well established in models of aortic aneurysm in Marfan syndrome and in renal fibrosis, where its capacity to interfere with AT1R-mediated profibrotic signaling is key (Kuchtey & Kuchtey, 2014; Igic, 2018). Although Losartan has not yet been widely adopted for glaucoma treatment, several preclinical studies have proposed its utility in ocular settings. Research indicates that components of the local ocular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) play critical roles in regulating intraocular pressure (IOP) and in mediating fibrotic responses in the trabecular meshwork (TM) and sclera. In animal models, treatment with Losartan has been associated with neuroprotective effects on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) as well as alterations in scleral remodeling that are beneficial in the context of glaucoma (Quigley et al., 2015; Oh et al., 2023). This translational evidence, although still primarily preclinical, establishes a basis for repurposing Losartan for glaucoma therapy, taking advantage of its established safety and pharmacologic profile derived from decades of systemic use (Hirooka & Kiuchi, 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Losartan acts through competitive inhibition of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). Inhibition of AT1R prevents the binding of angiotensin II (Ang II), a peptide hormone that normally induces vasoconstriction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrogenesis. Ang II signaling via AT1R is known to stimulate the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) pathway, which in turn activates intracellular signaling cascades characterized by the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3. The phosphorylated SMAD complexes translocate to the nucleus where they drive the transcription of genes involved in extracellular matrix synthesis, cell contraction, and fibrosis. This process is critically implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, particularly in promoting fibrotic remodeling of the trabecular meshwork (TM) that leads to increased outflow resistance, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), and subsequent retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss (Kuchtey & Kuchtey, 2014; Li et al., 2023).
Losartan’s antagonism at AT1R is selective, meaning that it prevents the deleterious effects of Ang II on TGF-β activation without interfering with the potentially beneficial signaling mediated by angiotensin II type 2 receptors (AT2R), which can counteract fibrosis. This selectivity may allow Losartan not only to reduce ECM deposition in TM cells by inhibiting SMAD2/3 phosphorylation but also to modulate trabecular meshwork cell contraction, thereby potentially improving aqueous humor outflow (Quigley et al., 2015; Kuchtey & Kuchtey, 2014). Moreover, Losartan is reported to exhibit antifibrotic effects in other tissue systems by reducing TGF-β levels and its downstream signaling cascades, suggesting a conserved mechanism that could be extrapolated to ocular tissues (Hirooka & Kiuchi, 2022; Kurihara et al., 2012). This molecular understanding is further reinforced by preclinical data indicating that Losartan’s inhibition of AT1R leads to a reduction in both ECM synthesis and cell contraction in key ocular tissues, thereby decreasing resistance in the aqueous outflow pathway (Oh et al., 2023).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis that modulation of the ocular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in glaucoma pathogenesis, the expected therapeutic effect of Losartan is multifaceted. Primarily, by preventing Ang II–mediated activation of latent TGF-β, Losartan would be anticipated to reduce SMAD2/3 phosphorylation in trabecular meshwork cells. This would lead to decreased transcription of fibrosis-related genes and a subsequent reduction in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and cell contraction. In the context of glaucoma, such antifibrotic effects would likely improve the physiology of the trabecular meshwork, enhance aqueous humor outflow, and thus help lower and better control intraocular pressure (IOP) (Igic, 2018; Li et al., 2023).
Additionally, preclinical studies have demonstrated that Losartan can protect retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from degeneration in experimental glaucoma models through its influence on tissue remodeling and neuroprotection. For instance, systemic administration of Losartan in animal models showed reduced fibrosis in ocular tissues—particularly in the sclera—altered mechanical properties that could mitigate the stress on the optic nerve head, and ultimately decreased RGC loss (Quigley et al., 2015; Oh et al., 2023). The expression of AT1R and local RAS components in the trabecular meshwork and scleral fibroblasts provides a strong molecular rationale for these effects, with relevant studies showing that these receptors are present in tissues critical for aqueous humor dynamics (White et al., 2015). Thus, the expected outcome in the proposed assays would be a measurable reduction in TGF-β signaling markers such as SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, decreased ECM protein deposition (e.g., collagen type I), and reduced cellular contractility in trabecular meshwork cells, ultimately translating into improved outflow facility and potentially lower IOP (Kuchtey & Kuchtey, 2014; Kurihara et al., 2012).

Overall Evaluation:
Losartan presents a compelling candidate for repurposing to treat glaucoma based on several converging lines of evidence. One major strength lies in its well-established safety profile and widespread clinical adoption in cardiovascular medicine, which minimizes the risk of unforeseeable adverse effects when administering a known drug systemically. Its ability to inhibit AT1R offers a clear mechanistic route to prevent Ang II–mediated TGF-β activation, a central driver of extracellular matrix remodeling and fibrosis within the trabecular meshwork—a key pathologic process in glaucoma (Hirooka & Kiuchi, 2022; Quigley et al., 2015). Furthermore, preclinical evidence supports that Losartan not only modulates the biochemical pathways critical for ECM synthesis and cell contraction but also confers neuroprotective benefits by preserving retinal ganglion cell survival through alterations in scleral remodeling and attenuation of fibrotic responses (Quigley et al., 2015; Oh et al., 2023). This dual action—improving aqueous outflow by targeting TM fibrosis and protecting retinal neurons—addresses both the mechanical and neurodegenerative facets of glaucoma pathophysiology.

Nonetheless, there are potential challenges and weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. Although Losartan has shown promising ocular penetration in preclinical studies and has been effective in modifying fibrotic responses in tissues outside the eye, direct clinical evidence in glaucoma patients is currently sparse. No large-scale clinical trials have been registered to assess its efficacy specifically for glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), and the translation of systemic antifibrotic effects to localized ocular benefits remains uncertain. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of Losartan in ocular tissues must be carefully characterized to ensure that therapeutic concentrations can be achieved in the trabecular meshwork without provoking systemic hypotension that could adversely affect ocular perfusion pressure (Quigley et al., 2015; Wilson, 2023). Furthermore, while the biochemical rationale is robust, the precise interactions between Losartan’s inhibition of AT1R and the downstream TGF-β/SMAD2/3 pathway in trabecular meshwork cells need further elucidation with dedicated in vitro and in vivo studies, including confirmation of changes in ECM synthesis and cell contractility relevant to aqueous outflow dynamics (Kuchtey & Kuchtey, 2014; Li et al., 2023).

In conclusion, based on the comprehensive literature review spanning biomedical, clinical, and biochemical studies, Losartan demonstrates substantial potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma. Its established systemic safety and antifibrotic efficacy, combined with encouraging preclinical evidence regarding ocular RAS modulation, position it as an attractive candidate warranting further detailed investigation. The outlined hypothesis—that Losartan will prevent Ang II–mediated activation of latent TGF-β in trabecular meshwork cells, reduce SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, lessen ECM synthesis, and ultimately improve aqueous outflow—is well supported by existing mechanistic studies in related tissue systems (Hirooka & Kiuchi, 2022; Quigley et al., 2015). Future research should focus on rigorous pharmacokinetic profiling in ocular tissues, dose optimization to avoid systemic effects, and well-designed preclinical and ultimately clinical trials to validate efficacy in human glaucoma patients. Overall, while certain knowledge gaps exist—chiefly regarding direct clinical data in glaucoma—the preclinical evidence and mechanistic rationale strongly justify Losartan’s continued evaluation as a promising drug candidate in the treatment of glaucoma (Igic, 2018; Oh et al., 2023).
