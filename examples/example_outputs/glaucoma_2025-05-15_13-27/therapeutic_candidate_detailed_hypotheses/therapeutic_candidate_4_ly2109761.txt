Proposal for LY2109761 (Sigma-Aldrich cat. SML0574).

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of LY2109761 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
LY2109761 is a synthetically derived small‐molecule inhibitor originally discovered through medicinal chemistry optimization efforts targeting the transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) receptor kinases. This compound belongs to the dihydropyrrolopyrazole class, which was developed by rational drug design methods that screened chemical libraries for candidates capable of inhibiting the kinase domain of TGF‐β receptor type I (also known as ALK5) and type II. In this design process, structure–activity relationship studies were undertaken to optimize potency and oral bioavailability, with X‐ray crystallography being used to validate its binding mode in the ATP‐binding pocket of the receptor kinase domain (Li et al., 2008). This class of compounds has previously been used in oncology as TGF‐β signaling inhibitors, where they have been evaluated for anti‐tumor efficacy, the ability to reduce metastasis, and to interfere with epithelial–mesenchymal transition. LY2109761, marketed by Sigma-Aldrich (cat. SML0574), was originally developed for its antitumor properties by demonstrating the ability to inhibit TGF‐β receptor kinase-mediated signaling, and it has shown promising antifibrotic activities in various nonocular studies (Ling & Lee, 2011; Melisi et al., 2008).

Therapeutic History:
Biochemically, LY2109761 has been profiled extensively in preclinical studies focused on fibrotic diseases and oncology. Preclinical animal models in cancer – particularly pancreatic cancer – highlighted its capacity to suppress tumor growth and metastasis through dual inhibition of TGF‐β receptor type I and II, blocking key downstream events such as SMAD phosphorylation and noncanonical MAPK activation (Melisi et al., 2008; Nagaraj & Datta, 2010). Its development as a TGF‐β receptor kinase inhibitor was aimed at targeting the fibrogenic responses mediated by TGF‐β, and indeed, LY2109761 has shown anti‐fibrotic efficacy in models of visceral organ fibrosis and liver fibrosis, reducing extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition by impairing SMAD and MAPK signaling (Luangmonkong et al., 2018; Markell, 2010). While the compound has not been evaluated in glaucoma per se, the inhibition of TGF‐β signaling has been a promising approach in other fibrotic disorders of the eye. For instance, other TGF‐β inhibitors and antibodies such as lerdelimumab have been clinically trialed in trabeculectomy to prevent bleb fibrosis (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ogata et al., 2024). In glaucoma, the pathological accumulation of ECM and increased trabecular meshwork (TM) stiffness are major contributors to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), and this has led to preclinical investigations of TGF‐β inhibition as a therapeutic avenue. Although LY2109761 has not been directly trialed for IOP modulation, its use in related fibrotic conditions provides a rationale for a repurposing strategy (Nagaraj & Datta, 2010).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, LY2109761 functions by competitively binding to the ATP‐binding site within the kinase domain of both TGF‐β receptor type I (ALK5) and type II. This binding prevents the autophosphorylation events required for receptor activation, thereby halting the initiation of intracellular signaling cascades (Ling & Lee, 2011; Li et al., 2008). The inhibition of receptor kinase activity leads to suppression of both the canonical (SMAD‐dependent) pathway and noncanonical pathways such as the MAPK cascade (e.g., ERK, JNK, and p38). More specifically, by preventing the phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3, LY2109761 stops the formation of the SMAD complex that translocates into the nucleus to drive the transcription of profibrotic genes, including those encoding for ECM proteins (collagen, fibronectin) and key contractile elements such as α‐smooth muscle actin (α‐SMA) (Markell, 2010; Nagaraj & Datta, 2010). In addition, inhibition of the MAPK noncanonical pathways may further decrease cell proliferation, migration, and contractility. Such dual blockade is particularly advantageous in tissues, like the trabecular meshwork, where TGF‐β signaling is known to drive ECM synthesis and stiffness, both of which can increase outflow resistance and elevate IOP (Ogata et al., 2024; Shim et al., 2021). The molecular interactions include specific hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts within the receptor’s ATP-binding cleft, supporting high specificity and potency of LY2109761 for inhibiting TGF‐β receptor kinases (Li et al., 2008).

Expected Effect:
In the context of glaucoma, the central hypothesis is that LY2109761 will reduce the fibrotic remodeling of the trabecular meshwork by blocking TGF‐β receptor signaling. Trabecular meshwork cells express TGF‐β receptors and are known to respond to elevated levels of TGF‐β2 by increasing ECM production and contractility, thereby increasing resistance to aqueous humor outflow and raising IOP (Nagaraj & Datta, 2010; Shim et al., 2021). The expected effect of LY2109761 in this assay is that by dual‐blocking both receptor isoforms, it will inhibit SMAD phosphorylation and downstream transcriptional upregulation of profibrotic genes, which in turn will result in reduced ECM synthesis, decreased cellular contractility, and an overall softening of the trabecular meshwork. Furthermore, the compound is expected to attenuate noncanonical MAPK pathway activation that may contribute further to cell motility and contraction (Zhang et al., 2018). Experimental readouts in relevant in vitro assays (e.g., primary trabecular meshwork cell cultures) would include decreased levels of phosphorylated SMAD2/3, lower expression of ECM proteins (such as collagen I and fibronectin), and diminished contractile properties (as measured by collagen gel contraction assays) (Cheng et al., 2020; Markell, 2010). In the specialized setting of glaucoma research, where alterations in trabecular meshwork function directly impact aqueous humor outflow, the broad blockade of TGF‐β signaling afforded by LY2109761 offers a compelling mechanism to lower IOP via modification of the cellular microenvironment (Ogata et al., 2024; Shim et al., 2021). Moreover, given that TGF‐β levels are known to be elevated in the aqueous humor of glaucoma patients, the target engagement by LY2109761 is both mechanistically rational and therapeutically promising (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of LY2109761 as a therapeutic candidate for glaucoma is promising but comes with several considerations. From a strengths standpoint, LY2109761 benefits from a well‐characterized mechanism of action involving the dual inhibition of TGF‐β receptor type I and II. This broad receptor blockade addresses receptor redundancy and has the potential to inhibit both SMAD-dependent and noncanonical MAPK pathways, which are key drivers of ECM synthesis and increased cell contractility in the trabecular meshwork (Li et al., 2008; Nagaraj & Datta, 2010). The compound’s preclinical anti‐fibrotic efficacy in other organ systems—such as in liver and pancreatic models—provides supportive evidence of its capability to modulate fibrotic pathways, suggesting that similar antifibrotic mechanisms could ameliorate the pathological remodeling seen in glaucoma (Luangmonkong et al., 2018; Markell, 2010). Furthermore, its documented oral bioavailability and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles reported in earlier studies enhance its translational potential for repurposing into ocular indications, even though topical ocular formulations may be further optimized (Ling & Lee, 2011; Melisi et al., 2008).

On the other hand, there are weaknesses and gaps to be addressed. To date, there is limited direct preclinical or clinical evidence of LY2109761 being used for ocular conditions such as glaucoma. Most studies have focused on cancer and visceral fibrosis; hence, the specific effects on trabecular meshwork cells and the outflow facility have yet to be established experimentally. Animal model data for glaucoma that directly measure IOP changes following LY2109761 administration are lacking in the current literature, and this represents a significant gap (ClinicalTrials.gov; Nagaraj & Datta, 2010). In addition, while dual receptor inhibition is a theoretical strength in terms of pathway suppression, it may also carry higher risks of off-target effects and potential side effects, given the ubiquitous role of TGF‐β signaling in tissue homeostasis, wound healing, immune regulation, and cell proliferation. Such safety and tolerability issues would need to be rigorously evaluated in the ocular context, where local immune responses and wound repair mechanisms are critical (Ogata et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov). Moreover, proper dosing strategies and formulation studies need to be developed to ensure appropriate drug bioavailability in the trabecular meshwork without toxicity to neighboring ocular tissues. Notably, the biochemical studies in corneal endothelial cells – although not directly in trabecular meshwork cells – provide encouraging evidence that LY2109761 can suppress TGF‐β-induced cellular transformation and ECM production, which indirectly supports its potential utility in glaucoma (Zhang et al., 2018).

In summary, the repurposing of LY2109761 for glaucoma is scientifically justified by its mechanism of dual TGF‐β receptor inhibition that can abrogate both SMAD‐dependent and noncanonical pro-fibrotic signaling cascades. The compound’s background in oncology and fibrotic disease models indicates that it has robust target engagement and anti-fibrotic properties. If applied to trabecular meshwork cells, the expected outcomes would be reduced ECM deposition, decreased cellular contractility, and improved aqueous humor outflow – all contributing to lower intraocular pressure. However, the major challenges remain in translating these biochemical effects into clinically demonstrable benefits in glaucoma, as direct preclinical IOP data are not yet available and safety parameters specific to the eye need to be well defined. Overall, LY2109761 represents a promising candidate for further investigation in glaucoma, with the primary strengths being its well‐defined mechanism of action and previous demonstration of antifibrotic efficacy, while the key weaknesses lie in the current lack of direct ocular data and the need for careful evaluation of off-target effects in an ocular environment (Nagaraj & Datta, 2010; Shim et al., 2021; Ogata et al., 2024).
