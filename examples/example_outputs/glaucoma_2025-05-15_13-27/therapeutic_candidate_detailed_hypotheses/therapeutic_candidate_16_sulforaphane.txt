Proposal for Sulforaphane, an Nrf2 pathway activator (Cayman Chemical cat. 77919).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate predominantly found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli. It was first discovered as part of research into dietary chemopreventive agents and has subsequently been characterized for its potent ability to activate the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway (Zhang et al., 2024, pp. 12–13). Belonging to the class of phytochemicals, sulforaphane has been employed as a dietary supplement and as an experimental therapeutic agent for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic properties. This compound is produced naturally by the hydrolysis of glucoraphanin via the enzyme myrosinase, and its chemical purity, as provided for example by Cayman Chemical (cat. 77919), further ensures reproducibility in experimental contexts. The class of Nrf2 activators to which sulforaphane belongs has a well-established history in modulating cellular redox homeostasis and has been investigated in numerous models of oxidative stress–related conditions, including various neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and ophthalmic diseases (Wherry, 2012, pp. 137–142).

Therapeutic History:
Sulforaphane’s therapeutic history encompasses a wide range of preclinical and biochemical studies that have demonstrated its ability to counteract oxidative stress in different organ systems. In ophthalmology, sulforaphane has been investigated for its cytoprotective effects in retinal pigment epithelial cells and corneal endothelial cells, as well as for its potential to attenuate photooxidative damage and other reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated injuries (Zhang et al., 2024, p. 13). Although direct clinical trials using sulforaphane for glaucoma treatment are currently absent—as evidenced by a search on ClinicalTrials.gov showing no registered trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—its preclinical utility in mitigating oxidative stress in ocular tissues is promising (Batliwala et al., 2017, pp. 10–11). Additionally, studies exploring its effects in fibroblasts have revealed that sulforaphane can inhibit transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)–induced fibrotic responses, suggesting potential benefits in conditions where fibrosis plays a role, such as in the trabecular meshwork of glaucoma patients (“Sulforaphane inhibits TGF-β-induced fibrogenesis and inflammation in human Tenon’s fibroblasts,” 2023, pp. 9–10).

Mechanism of Action:
Sulforaphane acts primarily by activating the Nrf2 pathway, a master regulator of antioxidant responses in cells. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its negative regulator Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1); sulforaphane covalently modifies specific cysteine residues on Keap1 (notably Cys151 among others), causing a conformational change that disrupts the Nrf2–Keap1 interaction, enabling Nrf2 to escape proteasomal degradation (Wherry, 2012, pp. 122–126). Once released, Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of target genes, leading to enhanced transcription of a suite of cytoprotective genes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and thioredoxin (Zhang et al., 2024, pp. 12–13; Wherry, 2012, pp. 122–126). In addition to its antioxidant action, sulforaphane has been shown to modulate intracellular signaling cascades such as those mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase C (PKC), which further augment Nrf2 activation and the subsequent expression of phase II detoxifying enzymes (Wherry, 2012, pp. 122–126). Of particular relevance to glaucoma, sulforaphane is posited to reduce ROS-induced activation of latent TGF-β, a key cytokine that drives fibrotic responses in the trabecular meshwork, leading to abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition; studies in related fibroblast models have demonstrated that sulforaphane can inhibit TGF-β signaling thereby reducing myofibroblast differentiation and ECM gene expression (“Sulforaphane inhibits TGF-β-induced fibrogenesis and inflammation in human Tenon’s fibroblasts,” 2023, pp. 1–2, 10–11). Thus, by simultaneously enhancing antioxidant defenses and suppressing pro-fibrotic signaling, sulforaphane operates through a dual mechanism that directly intersects with key pathogenic pathways implicated in glaucoma (Batliwala et al., 2017, pp. 10–11; Wang et al., 2020, pp. 2–3).

Expected Effect:
Based on its well-documented mechanism of action, it is expected that sulforaphane will induce robust Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses in trabecular meshwork (TM) cells. Enhanced expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1 and NQO1 should mitigate oxidative injury and help preserve TM cell function (Wang et al., 2020, pp. 5–6, 7–8). In the context of glaucoma, where oxidative stress contributes significantly to TM dysfunction and subsequent impairment of aqueous humor outflow, the activation of Nrf2 by sulforaphane could lower intraocular pressure (IOP) by protecting TM cells against ROS-induced damage. Additionally, sulforaphane is expected to reduce the activation of latent TGF-β by ROS, thereby preventing the TGF-β-mediated fibrotic remodeling of the TM. This modulation of TGF-β signaling is anticipated to downregulate fibrotic ECM gene expression, preserving the structural integrity and flexibility of the TM, which are critical factors for maintaining proper aqueous humor dynamics (Hurley et al., 2022, pp. 21–23; Wang et al., 2020, pp. 3–5). Although direct evidence for IOP lowering by sulforaphane is currently indirect, numerous preclinical models suggest that a reduction in TM cellular fibrosis and oxidative stress correlates with improved aqueous humor outflow and lowered IOP (Zhang et al., 2024, pp. 14–15; Yang et al., 2024, pp. 27–28).

Overall Evaluation:
Sulforaphane represents a promising therapeutic candidate for glaucoma from multiple perspectives. Its natural origin and favorable safety profile, established through its use as a dietary supplement and in various preclinical models, provide an attractive basis for drug repurposing (Zhang et al., 2024, pp. 12–13; Batliwala et al., 2017, pp. 10–11). The dual mechanism of action—activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant defense system combined with inhibition of TGF-β-mediated pro-fibrotic signaling—addresses two central pathological processes in glaucoma: oxidative damage and fibrotic remodeling of the trabecular meshwork. The induced expression of antioxidant enzymes may protect TM cells from ROS, while the concomitant reduction in ECM and fibrotic gene expression could improve aqueous humor outflow, ultimately contributing to a reduction in IOP (“Sulforaphane inhibits TGF-β-induced fibrogenesis and inflammation in human Tenon’s fibroblasts,” 2023, pp. 9–10; Wang et al., 2020, pp. 7–8). Despite these strengths, weaknesses include the current lack of direct clinical evidence specifically in glaucoma models, as noted by the absence of registered clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) and the need for enhanced bioavailability formulations to overcome challenges of poor solubility and tissue-specific delivery. Moreover, while in vitro and animal studies support the mechanistic rationale, translation of these findings into clinically meaningful IOP reductions remains to be conclusively demonstrated (Zhang et al., 2024, p. 13; Rohowetz et al., 2018, pp. 23–24). In summary, sulforaphane’s ability to fine-tune redox signaling and suppress fibrotic cascades through Nrf2 activation makes it a highly attractive candidate for further investigation in glaucoma, warranting additional preclinical studies with a focus on trabecular meshwork-specific outcomes and subsequent clinical trials to establish proof-of-concept in patients (Hurley et al., 2022, pp. 16–17; Ziaei et al., 2013, pp. 10–11).
