Proposal for Pamrevlumab (FG-3019), an anti–CTGF monoclonal antibody.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pamrevlumab (also known as FG-3019) is a humanized monoclonal antibody belonging to the class of biologic agents that target extracellular proteins involved in fibrotic pathways. Originally developed for the treatment of systemic fibrotic conditions, Pamrevlumab specifically neutralizes connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a matricellular protein that plays a critical role in mediating extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and tissue scarring. CTGF is a downstream mediator of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling and is responsible for amplifying fibrotic responses by stimulating the synthesis of collagen, fibronectin, and other ECM proteins. The molecule is produced via recombinant DNA technology in mammalian cell lines, ensuring proper folding and post-translational modifications that are essential for its high specificity toward CTGF. As part of the growing field of antibody-based anti-fibrotic therapies, Pamrevlumab has been primarily evaluated in clinical trials targeting idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and other systemic fibrotic disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Its design capitalizes on the potential to specifically block pathological CTGF activity without broadly inhibiting TGF-β, thereby preserving TGF-β’s homeostatic functions and suggesting an improved safety profile when compared to less selective agents (Wallace et al., 2013).

Therapeutic History:
Pamrevlumab’s clinical development history is rooted in its strong antifibrotic activity observed in several non-ocular settings. In clinical trials for IPF (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011) and diabetic nephropathy (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2009), the antibody has demonstrated target engagement as evidenced by reduced ECM deposition and favorable tolerability profiles. Although its use in glaucoma per se has not been directly investigated in clinical studies, extensive preclinical evidence indicates that CTGF is a critical driver of fibrotic processes in various tissues—including ocular structures such as the trabecular meshwork (TM) and lamina cribrosa (LC). Elevated CTGF levels in these ocular tissues are associated with increased deposition of ECM proteins like collagen type I and fibronectin, which in turn contribute to reduced aqueous humor (AH) outflow and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma (Hassan et al., 2023; Wallace et al., 2013). In addition, studies evaluating other anti-CTGF strategies in ocular models have shown that neutralizing CTGF can reverse fibrotic changes in the TM and decrease the stiffness of these tissues (Dillinger, 2019; van Setten et al., 2016). These findings provide a strong mechanistic rationale to repurpose Pamrevlumab for the treatment of glaucomatous fibrosis despite the absence of direct clinical data in this indication. Furthermore, the safety data gathered from systemic trials—in which Pamrevlumab was administered intravenously in patients with fibrotic diseases such as IPF (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011, 2020) and DMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016)—suggest that the antibody is well tolerated, a critical consideration when evaluating its potential for ocular application (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2003).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, CTGF operates as a central mediator in fibrosis, acting downstream from TGF-β signaling to promote the synthesis and deposition of ECM components including collagen and fibronectin. Pamrevlumab exerts its therapeutic effect by binding to a specific region within CTGF, most notably the von Willebrand factor type C (VWC) domain. This binding interrupts CTGF’s interaction with its downstream effectors and receptors on fibroblasts, thereby inhibiting the activation of profibrotic signaling cascades such as those involving mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and other intracellular pathways (Chen et al., 2020). In vitro studies using human TM and LC cells have demonstrated that exposure to oxidative stress or glaucomatous aqueous humor leads to an upregulation of CTGF and subsequent increases in the expression of fibrotic markers—including fibronectin, collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1), fibrillin-1, and α-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) (Wallace et al., 2013). When these cells are pretreated with an anti-CTGF antibody such as Pamrevlumab, there is a significant reduction in the expression levels of these profibrotic markers, which correlates with a reduction in ECM deposition. This suggests that CTGF is not only centrally involved in mediating fibrosis but also serves as a specific and effective therapeutic target to block ECM overproduction without affecting upstream regulatory elements like TGF-β that are essential for normal cellular functions (Fu et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2024). By neutralizing CTGF, Pamrevlumab should theoretically prevent the downstream activation of fibroblasts in the TM, reducing ECM accumulation and thus mitigating the mechanical stiffening of the TM that limits aqueous humor outflow—the primary pathogenic mechanism underlying the elevation of intraocular pressure in glaucoma (Fuchshofer et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
Within the context of glaucoma, the hypothesis driving the repurposing of Pamrevlumab is that it will neutralize CTGF in the trabecular meshwork, a tissue crucial to the regulation of aqueous humor outflow. In glaucomatous eyes, increased levels of CTGF are associated with an overproduction of ECM components, including collagen I and fibronectin, which lead to fibrotic remodeling and stiffening of the TM. This fibrotic process increases outflow resistance and, consequently, elevates intraocular pressure—a well-established risk factor for optic nerve damage in glaucoma (Hassan et al., 2023). The expected effect of Pamrevlumab, in this case, is to bind CTGF and thereby block its ability to stimulate collagen and fibronectin synthesis. Preclinical studies have provided evidence that CTGF inhibition can downregulate profibrotic gene expression in TM cells and reduce pathological ECM accumulation (Wallace et al., 2013; van Setten et al., 2016). Moreover, the presence of CTGF in the aqueous humor and its documented overexpression in glaucomatous tissues support the rationale that targeting CTGF will lead to normalization of the ECM composition in the TM, restoration of tissue pliability, and improved aqueous humor drainage, thereby reducing intraocular pressure (Hassan et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2021). Given that Pamrevlumab has already demonstrated target engagement and a favorable safety profile in systemic fibrotic conditions, its application in an ocular setting is logically anticipated to yield similar antifibrotic effects, provided that effective local delivery methods can be developed to overcome ocular pharmacokinetic challenges (Unknown Reference; Khaw et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
The comprehensive literature review indicates that Pamrevlumab (FG-3019) represents a very promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of glaucoma, particularly in addressing the fibrotic changes that contribute to elevated intraocular pressure. Its strengths include a well-defined mechanism of action that targets CTGF specifically—a key mediator downstream of TGF-β responsible for ECM overproduction in the trabecular meshwork—and a proven safety profile in Phase II clinical trials for systemic fibrosis such as IPF and DMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; 2016). The highly specific targeting of CTGF by Pamrevlumab minimizes interference with TGF-β’s physiological roles, which reduces the risk of adverse effects commonly seen with broader antifibrotic or anti-inflammatory therapies (Chen et al., 2020; Sheibani, 2022).

However, there are also significant challenges and weaknesses associated with repurposing Pamrevlumab for glaucoma. First, although preclinical data strongly support the role of CTGF in ocular fibrosis—particularly in the trabecular meshwork—the direct evidence of Pamrevlumab’s efficacy in ocular models of glaucoma remains limited. Most of the existing clinical data pertain to fibrotic diseases of the lungs, kidney, or muscle rather than the eye (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008). This gap necessitates robust preclinical ocular studies to evaluate the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of Pamrevlumab when administered via ocular routes, such as intravitreal injection or topical formulations. Delivery poses another challenge given the ocular barriers that may limit systemic bioavailability to anterior segment tissues. The large molecular size of monoclonal antibodies further complicates their penetration into targeted ocular tissues, meaning that novel drug delivery systems—possibly nanoparticle-based carriers or sustained-release formulations—must be developed to ensure sufficient local concentrations of the drug in the trabecular meshwork (Lim et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2024).

Another potential weakness is the possibility of off-target effects or systemic exposure following ocular administration. Although anti-CTGF therapies are known for their specificity, CTGF is expressed in multiple ocular tissues beyond the trabecular meshwork, including the lamina cribrosa and retina, which raises the need for careful evaluation of adverse effects in these regions. Safety assessments drawn from systemic trials might not fully predict ocular tolerability, particularly given the delicate architecture and unique physiological conditions of the eye (Sarkis et al., 2025; van Setten et al., 2016).

On the biochemical and mechanistic fronts, the rationale for targeting CTGF in glaucoma is compelling. CTGF amplification of fibrotic signals downstream of TGF-β has been well documented (Dillinger, 2019; Fu et al., 2022), and its inhibition has been shown in vitro to reduce expression of ECM proteins that contribute to increased outflow resistance. Moreover, clinical studies in fibrotic conditions have confirmed that blocking CTGF can lead to significant reductions in ECM deposition, lending credence to the hypothesis that similar antifibrotic effects could be achieved in glaucomatous eyes (Wallace et al., 2013; Strickland et al., 2022). These data collectively suggest that if Pamrevlumab can be effectively delivered to the target tissue in the eye, it has the potential to restore normal aqueous outflow dynamics by reversing or preventing abnormal ECM accumulation and tissue stiffening.

In summary, while the repurposing of Pamrevlumab for glaucoma is based on a strong pharmacological rationale and supported by extensive evidence from systemic fibrotic diseases, there remain several key hurdles that need to be addressed. These include confirming target engagement in ocular tissues, optimizing local delivery to overcome ocular barriers, and thoroughly assessing safety within the ocular microenvironment. Nonetheless, given its high specificity, demonstrated safety in other indications, and robust mechanism of inhibiting CTGF-driven fibrosis, Pamrevlumab represents a promising candidate worthy of further investigation as a novel disease-modifying therapy for glaucoma (Hassan et al., 2023; Wallace et al., 2013; Shao et al., 2023).
