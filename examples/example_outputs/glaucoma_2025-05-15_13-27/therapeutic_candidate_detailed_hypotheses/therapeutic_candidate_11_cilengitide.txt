Proposal for Cilengitide (EMD 121974), an integrin αVβ3/αVβ5 antagonist.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Cilengitide (EMD 121974) is a synthetic cyclic pentapeptide composed of an RGD (arginine–glycine–aspartic acid) sequence that has been cyclized to improve stability, binding affinity, and selectivity relative to linear RGD peptides. By virtue of its cyclic structure, cilengitide is resistant to proteolytic degradation and is able to maintain a fixed conformation that optimizes its interaction with target integrins. It was developed through structure–activity relationship studies that aimed to enhance both selectivity and potency for integrins, particularly αvβ3 and αvβ5, which are key receptors mediating cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. This therapeutic candidate belongs to the class of integrin antagonists, compounds which are used to disrupt normal receptor–ligand interactions at the cell surface that trigger focal adhesion formation and downstream signaling cascades. Historically, integrin antagonists have been explored for their ability to block pathological cell adhesion, migration, angiogenesis, and survival signals in a variety of diseases, predominantly in oncology. In this context, cilengitide was initially reported as a potent inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis and metastasis with a particular focus on glioblastoma multiforme, where integrin-mediated signaling plays a critical role in tumor progression (Caporello et al., 2012; Reardon et al., 2011).

Therapeutic History:
Cilengitide has been examined extensively over the past decades, primarily in the field of oncology. Preclinical studies established that cilengitide potently inhibits endothelial cell adhesion and migration through its binding to integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5, both of which are highly expressed in tumor-associated vasculature and in certain tumor cell types. Clinical trials in patients with advanced solid tumors, including glioblastoma multiforme, have demonstrated that cilengitide possesses a favorable safety profile and that it is safe for repeated administration. Phase I and phase II clinical trials have confirmed its tolerability with no maximum tolerated dose reached and provided evidence of target engagement, as well as biological activity indicative of its antiangiogenic effects (Reardon et al., 2008; Reardon et al., 2011). Although its development was driven primarily by oncology applications, no direct clinical trials have yet established its use in glaucoma or related fibrotic conditions. Nonetheless, the mechanistic rationale derived from its integrin-targeting properties has recently inspired interest in repurposing this compound for ocular fibrotic diseases. A number of studies in the retinovascular domain have detailed the potential of integrin antagonists to modulate extracellular matrix interactions and neovascularization, with integrin αvβ3 playing an important role in the activation of latent transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), a key mediator of fibrotic cascades (Bhatwadekar et al., 2020). Furthermore, cyclic RGD peptides structurally and functionally similar to cilengitide have been explored in the context of trabecular meshwork (TM) cell fibrosis—a central process in glaucoma pathology—suggesting that repurposing such an integrin inhibitor may be highly plausible (Hennig et al., 2016; Faralli et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, cilengitide acts as a competitive inhibitor by binding to the RGD recognition site on the integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5. These integrins normally bind extracellular ligands such as vitronectin, fibronectin, and tenascin-C, which contain an RGD motif that facilitates adhesion and subsequent intracellular signaling. By occupying the binding pocket, cilengitide prevents the natural ligands from binding, thereby inhibiting integrin clustering and the formation of focal adhesion complexes. This blockage disrupts the subsequent activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and other downstream signaling pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK cascades that are critical for cell survival, proliferation, and migration (Reardon et al., 2011).

In addition to its direct effects on cell adhesion, integrin αvβ3 is critically involved in the activation of latent TGF-β, a cytokine secreted in a biologically inactive—or latent—complex bound to the ECM. The conformational changes and physical forces transmitted through the actin cytoskeleton via focal adhesion complexes enable integrin αvβ3 to induce a structural rearrangement in the latent TGF-β complex, thereby releasing active TGF-β. In the trabecular meshwork, high integrin αvβ3 expression has been linked to elevated activation of TGF-β, which then stimulates a fibrotic response characterized by increased deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin and collagen, and an abnormal increase in cell contractility mediated by downstream signaling events involving Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) and the Hippo pathway effectors Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) and Transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) (Bhatwadekar et al., 2020; Hennig et al., 2016). These signaling pathways contribute to enhanced focal adhesion assembly, cytoskeletal reorganization, and extracellular matrix stiffening—changes that directly correlate with decreased aqueous outflow, leading to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma. By antagonizing αvβ3 and αvβ5, cilengitide is hypothesized to block this chain of events early in the cascade: it will prevent integrin-mediated activation of latent TGF-β, thereby reducing the subsequent stimulation of ROCK and YAP/TAZ signaling and ultimately suppressing aberrant fibrotic ECM remodeling (Irnaten et al., 2024; Reardon et al., 2011).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed application for glaucoma, the expected effect of cilengitide is to disrupt the fibrotic processes within the trabecular meshwork (TM) that contribute to increased outflow resistance and elevated intraocular pressure, which are hallmarks of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Specifically, in vitro and in vivo assays using TM cells exposed to pro-fibrotic stimuli (such as elevated levels of latent TGF-β) should demonstrate that cilengitide treatment leads to:

1. A significant inhibition of integrin αvβ3-mediated activation of latent TGF-β. Since integrin αvβ3 is highly expressed in TM cells and is responsible for initiating the conversion of latent TGF-β into its active form, cilengitide should lower the levels of active TGF-β in the TM microenvironment (Bhatwadekar et al., 2020; Faralli et al., 2019).

2. A reduction in downstream signal transduction pathways, particularly those mediated by ROCK and the YAP/TAZ transcriptional regulators. Disruption of these signaling cascades would be evident through a decrease in markers such as phosphorylated ERK1/2, reduced stress fiber formation, and a diminishment in the nuclear accumulation of YAP/TAZ. These molecular changes can be quantitatively assessed using Western blot assays and immunocytochemistry (Irnaten et al., 2024; Hennig et al., 2016).

3. A decrease in the expression and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin and collagen, which are typically upregulated by TGF-β activation and integrin-mediated signaling. Molecular assays measuring mRNA and protein levels for fibronectin, collagen, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) would be anticipated to show lower values following treatment with cilengitide, reflecting an attenuation of fibrotic remodeling in TM cells (Bhatwadekar et al., 2020; Faralli et al., 2023).

4. An overall improvement in the biomechanical properties of the trabecular meshwork. Ex vivo models or animal studies should reveal that cilengitide-treated TM tissue exhibits reduced stiffness and improved aqueous humor outflow facility. Enhanced outflow performance would be reflected in a measurable reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) via tonometric or perfusion assay methods (Filla et al., 2019; Faralli et al., 2023).

Given that integrin-targeted cyclic RGD peptides have demonstrated the ability to reduce connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)-induced fibrotic responses in human TM cells—with significant reductions in ECM protein production and focal adhesion remodeling—the analogous mechanism attributed to cilengitide supports the rationale that it could yield similar beneficial outcomes in glaucoma treatment by inhibiting the upstream activators of fibrosis (Hennig et al., 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
The potential for repurposing cilengitide as a therapeutic agent for glaucoma is supported by a robust mechanistic rationale and a substantial foundational body of literature regarding its integrin antagonism. Its high affinity and selectivity for integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5, which are fundamentally involved in integrin-mediated activation of latent TGF-β in the trabecular meshwork, form the basis for its proposed effectiveness. The strengths of cilengitide in this context include:

• A well-characterized molecular mechanism of action that disrupts critical integrin–ECM interactions. By occupying the RGD binding sites on αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins, the compound prevents the integrin-mediated conformational changes required for TGF-β activation. This early intervention in the pathogenic cascade is a significant strength as it targets the upstream drivers of fibrotic remodeling in the TM (Reardon et al., 2011; Bhatwadekar et al., 2020).

• An established clinical safety profile from extensive oncology trials. The favorable pharmacokinetics and tolerability observed in patients with advanced solid tumors provide a strong precedent for its potential repurposing. Although the tissue environments differ, the clinical experience serves as a significant advantage in terms of risk reduction when considering repositioning (Reardon et al., 2008; Hariharan et al., 2007).

• The capacity to interrupt a pathogenic feed-forward loop between ECM stiffness and pro-fibrotic signaling. In glaucoma, increased ECM deposition in the trabecular meshwork establishes a vicious cycle, wherein elevated stiffness further stimulates integrin-mediated activation of fibrotic cascades. Cilengitide’s mechanism directly addresses this issue by masking the integrin binding sites, thus potentially restoring the dynamic equilibrium needed for normal aqueous outflow (Irnaten et al., 2024; Faralli et al., 2023).

Despite these strengths, several challenges and potential weaknesses should be considered:

• There exists a notable gap in direct preclinical or clinical evidence for cilengitide’s efficacy in ocular tissues or in models of glaucoma. The majority of data derive from oncology studies and studies on retinal and trabecular meshwork cells using similar cyclic RGD peptides rather than cilengitide per se. Therefore, dedicated studies in TM cell cultures and appropriate animal models of glaucoma are essential to validate its purported effects (Bhatwadekar et al., 2020; Reardon et al., 2011).

• The unique microenvironment of the trabecular meshwork, including differences in integrin expression profiles and extracellular matrix composition, may necessitate reformulation or dosing adjustments. Cilengitide’s current mode of administration in oncology has been an intravenous route, and while its pharmacodynamic properties are favorable, achieving sufficient localized concentrations in the TM via ocular delivery may present technical hurdles (Bhatwadekar et al., 2020; Reardon et al., 2008).

• There is evidence from related studies that integrin antagonists can exhibit biphasic effects; at low concentrations, some cyclic RGD peptides have been reported to induce paradoxical integrin activation rather than inhibition. Such effects could potentially counteract the therapeutic goal if dosage is not carefully optimized (Sheldrake & Patterson, 2014).

• Glaucoma pathophysiology is multifactorial, involving not only fibrotic ECM remodeling driven by integrin-mediated TGF-β activation but also contributions from inflammatory processes, oxidative stress, and other non-fibrotic pathways. It is possible that inhibiting integrin signaling alone may not sufficiently address all aspects of disease pathology, which might necessitate combination therapies for optimal efficacy (Irnaten et al., 2024; Faralli et al., 2023).

In summary, cilengitide possesses significant potential as an innovative therapeutic candidate for glaucoma, owing to its precise integrin-targeting mechanism, its solid history in clinical oncology, and the strong mechanistic links between integrin-mediated activation of latent TGF-β and the fibrotic remodeling of the trabecular meshwork. Its hypothesized ability to block integrin αvβ3/αvβ5-mediated TGF-β activation and to disrupt the downstream signal transduction cascades (such as the ROCK and YAP/TAZ pathways) that drive fibrotic ECM deposition could lead to improved aqueous humor outflow and lowered intraocular pressure. However, while the theoretical basis is sound, major gaps remain regarding direct evidence in ocular models. Focused preclinical studies in TM cells and animal models of glaucoma are critical to establish dosing strategies, confirm target engagement in the ocular microenvironment, and rule out any unforeseen compensatory mechanisms. Should these studies prove favorable, formulation and delivery challenges will need to be addressed to transition from an established intravenous oncology drug to an effective ocular therapeutic. With rigorous investigation, cilengitide represents a promising repurposing candidate that may offer a novel upstream intervention for glaucoma by targeting integrin-mediated mechanotransduction and fibrotic signaling (Bhatwadekar et al., 2020; Hennig et al., 2016; Irnaten et al., 2024; Reardon et al., 2011; Sheldrake & Patterson, 2014).
