Proposal for Tranilast.

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of Tranilast as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tranilast, chemically known as N-[3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl]-anthranilic acid, is a synthetic compound originally derived from anthranilic acid derivatives. It was discovered in Japan during the search for novel anti-allergic agents and has been used for decades in Eastern markets. As a member of the anti-allergy and anti-fibrotic drug classes, Tranilast was initially developed for bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis. Over time, its anti-fibrotic properties became evident during studies aimed at inhibiting keloid formation and hypertrophic scarring. This compound is synthesized via chemical modifications that yield its characteristic cinnamoyl-anthranilic acid structure, which confers its ability to modulate inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. Anthranilic acid derivatives as a class have been previously repurposed to treat fibrotic conditions due to their antiproliferative and cytokine-modulating properties (Rogosnitzky, 2012). Their historical use in treating keloids and other fibrotic disorders has set precedent in exploring them for other diseases characterized by aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. In the context of glaucoma, which is characterized by increased trabecular meshwork (TM) stiffness and reduced aqueous humor outflow largely driven by fibrotic remodeling, the use of a drug with anti-fibrotic effects and an established safety record makes Tranilast an attractive candidate (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Tranilast’s initial therapeutic use focused on allergic diseases, and it has been approved for use clinically in Japan and South Korea since the early 1980s. Its ripple effects in fibrotic disorders became apparent in subsequent clinical observations in which manufacturers noted improvements in scar formation, particularly in keloids and hypertrophic scars. In ophthalmology, Tranilast has been applied topically for allergic conjunctivitis and, more recently, as an adjunctive intervention in ocular surgeries such as pterygium excision (Junior, 2015; Choi, 2016). Although Tranilast has not been extensively tested in large-scale clinical trials specifically for primary open-angle glaucoma, preclinical studies and early-phase clinical investigations in ocular fibrotic conditions have documented its inhibitory effects on fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and transformation induced by growth factors. Its capacity to inhibit TGF-β–mediated signaling was initially observed in in vitro models derived from nonocular fibroblasts, and later, similar biochemical properties were demonstrated in some ocular tissues. In animal models, tranilast has been used to prevent postoperative adhesion and scarring following eye surgeries – an application that underscores its potential to modulate fibrotic responses in the eye (Choi, 2016; Junior, 2015). While its use in glaucoma remains exploratory, the success observed in reducing fibrotic changes in conjunctival and pterygium tissues provides a rationale for repurposing it to target similar pathological mechanisms in the trabecular meshwork (Agarwal, 2009).

Mechanism of Action:
Tranilast’s primary mechanism of action is based on its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties through the inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling. At the molecular level, Tranilast has been shown to interfere with both the secretion and downstream signaling of TGF-β. Under normal and pathological states alike, TGF-β is secreted as a latent complex; once activated, it binds to its receptors on target cells and triggers the phosphorylation cascade of receptor-regulated SMAD proteins (especially Smad2 and Smad3). These phosphorylated SMAD proteins then form a complex with SMAD4 and translocate to the nucleus where they induce the transcription of a variety of genes associated with extracellular matrix production, including collagens, fibronectin, and matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors. This cascade is a key driver of tissue fibrosis (Fuchshofer, 2012; Agarwal, 2009).

Tranilast has been documented to inhibit TGF-β release from cells, including fibroblasts, and to reduce TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of SMAD proteins. For example, studies on cultured fibroblasts from pterygium tissues demonstrated that tranilast significantly reduces both cell proliferation and collagen-gel contraction, indicating a direct suppression of TGF-β–mediated fibrotic processes (Isaji, 2000; Junior, 2015). Additionally, biochemical analyses have shown that tranilast can modulate inflammatory mediator release, including interleukins and prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂), which further contributes to its anti-fibrotic capacity by interrupting autocrine loops that perpetuate fibrosis (Capper, 2000).

On a more detailed level, tranilast likely exerts its effects by preventing the transcriptional activation of ECM genes driven by the SMAD complex. Given that aberrant ECM accumulation in the trabecular meshwork is a pivotal contributor to increased outflow resistance and intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma, inhibiting SMAD-mediated gene expression is an attractive therapeutic strategy (Fuchshofer, 2012). In glaucoma models, TGF-β2 specifically has been implicated in increasing ECM deposition in TM cells. The hypothesis is that by reducing TGF-β signaling, tranilast would decrease the production of collagens and fibronectin in the TM, thereby reducing its stiffness and improving aqueous humor outflow (Agarwal, 2009; Hachana, 2022). Moreover, tranilast does not appear to completely abolish collagen synthesis in normal fibroblasts but rather selectively inhibits the exaggerated collagen production seen in pathologic conditions, lending support to its targeted action in diseased tissues without adversely affecting normal tissue homeostasis (Isaji, 2000).

Expected Effect:
Based on the mechanistic profile of tranilast, it is expected that in assays involving trabecular meshwork cells the compound will inhibit the release and downstream signaling of TGF-β. Preclinical studies have shown that TGF-β levels are abnormally elevated in the aqueous humor of glaucoma patients and that TGF-β drives the expression of several fibrotic markers via SMAD signaling, leading to increased ECM deposition, TM stiffness, and, consequently, higher IOP (Fuchshofer, 2012; Agarwal, 2009). Therefore, when applied to TM cells in vitro, tranilast is hypothesized to reduce SMAD-dependent transcription of ECM genes, including those coding for collagens and fibronectin, thereby lowering the fibrotic remodeling in the TM. This reduction in ECM deposition would, in turn, decrease trabecular tissue stiffness, facilitating improved aqueous humor outflow and a subsequent lowering of IOP (Tejwani, 2020; Choudhari, 2022).

In addition to its direct anti-fibrotic effects, tranilast is also expected to diminish the myofibroblast transdifferentiation of TM cells. The transformation of normal TM cells into myofibroblast-like cells, characterized by the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and other contractile proteins, is a critical event in the development of increased TM rigidity. By inhibiting TGF-β–induced signaling, tranilast should reduce the conversion of these cells, thereby maintaining the functional, compliant nature of the TM (Fuchshofer, 2012; Agarwal, 2009). Furthermore, previous studies in related ocular fibrotic models have demonstrated that tranilast decreases TGF-β expression itself, which should further attenuate the positive feedback loops that drive fibrosis in the TM (Junior, 2015; Choi, 2016). Overall, the expected outcome in TM cell-based assays and potentially in in vivo models of glaucoma is a reduction in pro-fibrotic gene expression, ECM deposition, and TM stiffness, all culminating in improved outflow facility and a reduction in intraocular pressure (Tejwani, 2020; Agarwal, 2009).

Overall Evaluation:
Tranilast emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in glaucoma due to its well-documented anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties, coupled with its ability to modulate TGF-β signaling at multiple levels. One of its greatest strengths is its extensive history of clinical use and the established safety profile in ocular and nonocular indications. Its use in treating allergic conditions and as an adjunct in pterygium surgery has provided evidence of both ocular tolerability and its capacity to reduce TGF-β expression and fibrotic tissue remodeling (Junior, 2015; Choi, 2016). This background supports the feasibility of using tranilast to target similar fibrotic mechanisms in the trabecular meshwork, a key pathological event in glaucoma pathogenesis. Moreover, the molecular rationale underlying tranilast’s mechanism of action, namely the inhibition of TGF-β secretion and subsequent SMAD-mediated ECM gene transcription, directly addresses the hypothesized pathophysiology in glaucomatous TM tissues (Fuchshofer, 2012; Agarwal, 2009).

However, there are some weaknesses and gaps that merit further investigation. Despite promising preclinical data in models of ocular fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases, direct evidence of tranilast’s efficacy in reducing intraocular pressure or modulating trabecular meshwork stiffness in glaucoma patients is currently limited. Most of the existing studies have focused on fibrotic responses in pterygium or pulmonary fibrosis models (Kato, 2020; Rogosnitzky, 2012), and while the underlying biology is relevant, the translation to a TM context remains to be fully validated. Additionally, the potential pharmacokinetics and ocular bioavailability of tranilast when delivered to the TM need to be elucidated in further preclinical studies to ensure that sufficient drug concentrations reach the target tissue without adverse effects. It will be important to investigate whether topical or intracameral formulations of tranilast can achieve therapeutic levels in the anterior chamber while maintaining its safety profile (Minami, 2020).

Furthermore, targeting a ubiquitous cytokine like TGF-β comes with inherent challenges, given its broad role in tissue homeostasis and immune regulation. Nonselective inhibition of TGF-β might risk diminishing its physiological functions outside the pathological context, thereby increasing the potential for unintended side effects. This necessitates careful patient selection and dosing strategies to ensure that tranilast’s anti-fibrotic effects are maximized in the TM without compromising TGF-β’s beneficial roles elsewhere (Agarwal, 2009; Hachana, 2022).

In summary, Tranilast represents a compelling candidate for glaucoma therapy based on its mechanistic ability to inhibit TGF-β signaling and downstream SMAD-mediated ECM gene expression. This mechanism is well-aligned with current understandings of trabecular meshwork fibrosis, increased TM stiffness, and subsequent intraocular pressure elevation in glaucoma. Its therapeutic history in treating fibrotic conditions and its favorable safety profile further enhance its appeal. Nevertheless, critical gaps regarding its direct efficacy in glaucoma models and optimal delivery to ocular tissues must be addressed in subsequent preclinical and clinical studies. Overall, further research into tranilast’s pharmacodynamics in TM cells, its bioavailability in anterior segment tissues, and controlled clinical trials in glaucoma patients are warranted to fully assess its potential in lowering IOP and preventing glaucoma progression (Tejwani, 2020; Choudhari, 2022; Rogosnitzky, 2012).

Based on the literature review above, our expert drug development team concludes that tranilast has significant mechanistic and preclinical rationale for repurposing as a treatment for glaucoma. The advantages offered by its TGF-β inhibitory and anti-fibrotic actions strongly support further investigation into its efficacy in reducing trabecular meshwork stiffness and lowering intraocular pressure in glaucomatous eyes. However, careful attention must be paid to formulation, dosing, and controlled clinical evaluation to mitigate potential off-target effects given TGF-β’s ubiquitous role in cell signaling.
