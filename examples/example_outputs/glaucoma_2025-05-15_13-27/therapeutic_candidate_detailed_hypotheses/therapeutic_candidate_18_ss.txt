Proposal for SS-31 (Elamipretide), a mitochondrial membrane‐targeting peptide.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SS-31, also known as Elamipretide, is a synthetic tetrapeptide originally discovered and subsequently optimized from the Szeto–Schiller peptide class. It consists of a sequence with alternating aromatic and cationic residues—typically represented as H-D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH₂—which confers a net positive charge at physiological pH and enables selective mitochondrial targeting (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015). The peptide's design allows it to rapidly penetrate cell membranes without requiring energy-dependent transport and preferentially accumulates in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) by binding specifically to cardiolipin, an anionic phospholipid that is unique to mitochondria (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Mitchell et al., 2022). Synthetic modifications, such as incorporation of 2,6-dimethyltyrosine (Dmt) in place of tyrosine and C-terminal amidation, enhance both its metabolic stability and its scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to naturally occurring antioxidants (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Stefaniak et al., 2024). This class of mitochondria‐targeting peptides has been broadly investigated for its ability to ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction, with previous applications in conditions such as cardiac ischemia, cellular aging, and neurodegenerative diseases (Chhetri & Gueven, 2016; Nashine, 2021), establishing a strong rationale for repurposing in other disorders linked to mitochondrial impairment including glaucoma.

Therapeutic History:
SS-31 has an extensive preclinical and clinical history centered around its role as a mitochondrial protective agent. Its therapeutic development has spanned multiple disease indications where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role. In preclinical models, SS-31 has demonstrated efficacy in improving mitochondrial bioenergetics, reducing excessive ROS production, and preventing cell apoptosis in contexts ranging from age‐related decline in visual function to myocardial ischemia‐reperfusion injury (Alam, Douglas, & Prusky, 2020; Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015). Clinically, SS-31 is in various stages of investigation for mitochondrial‐related disorders; it has been tested in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for conditions such as primary mitochondrial myopathy and age‐related macular degeneration, showing promising safety profiles and target engagement (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015, 2022). Although direct clinical studies in glaucoma remain limited, several studies in animal models have indicated that SS-31 can protect retinal cells from oxidative stress and support overall retinal function (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Alam, Douglas, & Prusky, 2020). Moreover, related research in diabetic retinopathy models and neurodegenerative conditions highlights the potential of SS-31 to prevent apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), a key pathological hallmark in glaucoma (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Jutley et al., 2017). The overall body of work on this drug candidate and similar mitochondria‐targeting peptides substantiates its repurposing potential for ocular diseases sharing a mitochondrial pathology, including glaucoma (Chhetri & Gueven, 2016; Nashine, 2021; Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
SS-31 exerts its effects through a multifaceted mechanism of mitochondrial protection that is now well characterized at the molecular level. Its primary mode of action involves a high-affinity binding to cardiolipin in the IMM. This binding stabilizes mitochondrial cristae structure and organizes electron transport chain (ETC) complexes into supercomplexes, thereby enhancing electron flux and improving ATP production (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Mitchell et al., 2021). By binding cardiolipin, SS-31 not only prevents its peroxidation—a process that normally leads to increased ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction—but also inhibits cytochrome c peroxidase activity, thereby preventing cytochrome c release and apoptosis via caspase activation (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Chhetri & Gueven, 2016).

In addition to these antioxidant effects, SS-31 modulates the electrostatics at the mitochondrial membrane surface and preserves the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), which is critical for maintaining normal mitochondrial function under stress conditions (Mitchell et al., 2022; Tamucci, Alder, & May, 2023). These properties allow SS-31 to effectively reduce the intracellular accumulation of ROS without interfering with the normal function of the ETC, thereby providing a targeted intervention upstream of pathological cascades involving TGF-β signaling. The reduction in oxidative stress is particularly relevant because excessive ROS can trigger profibrotic signaling cascades, including those mediated by TGF-β, leading to extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and a contractile phenotype in trabecular meshwork cells (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Forini et al., 2020). Moreover, research indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction is a central regulator of RGC death in glaucoma and that protecting mitochondrial integrity can preserve cellular function and viability (Muench et al., 2021; Jutley et al., 2017). Importantly, the ubiquitous expression of cardiolipin in mitochondria implies that SS-31 will target trabecular meshwork cells as effectively as it does neurons, supporting its potential role in preserving ocular function by mitigating mitochondrial oxidative stress.

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, SS-31 is expected to preserve mitochondrial function in trabecular meshwork cells by directly reducing levels of ROS and preventing mitochondrial dysfunction. By scavenging ROS and stabilizing cardiolipin, SS-31 should interrupt the cascade of events that normally leads to mitochondrial permeability transition, cytochrome c release, and subsequent apoptosis (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Mitchell et al., 2021). This mitochondrial protection is hypothesized to have a downstream effect on cellular signaling pathways, particularly TGF-β signaling, which is known to be activated by oxidative stress and is a critical driver of ECM deposition and fibrosis in the trabecular meshwork (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Alam, Douglas, & Prusky, 2020).

In the proposed assay, a reduction in oxidative stress markers and preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential would be key readouts, correlating with decreased activation of TGF-β cascades. The downstream impact should include a reduction in ECM protein deposition and a decrease in the contractile phenotype typically associated with glaucomatous changes in the trabecular meshwork (Chhetri & Gueven, 2016; Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015). Additionally, there is strong evidence from ocular studies that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to RGC apoptosis; thus, by preserving mitochondrial function in retinal and trabecular meshwork cells, SS-31 is expected to offer neuroprotective benefits that may slow or prevent the progression of glaucoma (Alam, Douglas, & Prusky, 2020; Jutley et al., 2017). Expression of mitochondrial target proteins, including cardiolipin, is well-documented in both RGCs and trabecular meshwork cells, further confirming that the drug’s targets are present in the cell types that are critical in glaucoma pathophysiology (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Chhetri & Gueven, 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, SS-31 presents a compelling therapeutic candidate for glaucoma due to its robust mitochondrial protective properties, favorable safety profile from existing clinical data, and its well-defined mechanism of action that directly addresses the upstream pathological events leading to oxidative stress and TGF-β activation. The strengths of SS-31 include its proven ability to stabilize mitochondrial membranes via specific interaction with cardiolipin, its efficient cellular uptake and mitochondrial targeting, and its broad efficacy in preclinical models of mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Mitchell et al., 2022). Additionally, its ability to reduce ROS and preserve mitochondrial bioenergetics directly implicates it in the suppression of profibrotic TGF-β cascades, a central element in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous damage to trabecular meshwork cells (Alam, Douglas, & Prusky, 2020; Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015).

However, the candidate’s weaknesses lie primarily in the current lack of direct clinical studies in glaucoma patients and limited data on its specific effects on trabecular meshwork cells and TGF-β signaling modulation within ocular tissues. While there is promising evidence from studies involving diabetic retinopathy models and general mitochondrial neuroprotection in the eye (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Alam, Douglas, & Prusky, 2020), more focused research is needed to substantiate its efficacy specifically in the context of glaucoma. Furthermore, while existing clinical trials have demonstrated its safety and tolerability in other conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015, 2022), adapting the systemic delivery of SS-31 to an ocular application (e.g., topical administration) may require additional formulation development to ensure adequate bioavailability in the target tissue.

In conclusion, SS-31 (Elamipretide) stands out as a promising mitochondrial membrane-targeting peptide with significant potential to preserve trabecular meshwork cell function by reducing oxidative stress and subsequent activation of deleterious TGF-β signaling cascades. Its well-characterized mechanism of binding cardiolipin, coupled with robust preclinical evidence and an excellent safety profile in clinical trials for other mitochondrial diseases, supports its repurposing for glaucoma therapy. However, further targeted studies, including direct evaluations in glaucoma models and pharmacokinetic studies focused on ocular delivery, are necessary to fully validate its therapeutic potential for glaucoma (Chhetri & Gueven, 2016; Nashine, 2021; Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015).
