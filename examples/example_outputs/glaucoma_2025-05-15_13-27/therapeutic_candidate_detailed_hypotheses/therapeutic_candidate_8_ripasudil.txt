Proposal for Ripasudil (K-115), a rho kinase inhibitor approved for glaucoma in Japan.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Ripasudil (K-115) is a small‐molecule synthetic compound belonging to the class of Rho‐associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitors. It was discovered and developed by Kowa Company through chemical modifications of earlier compounds such as fasudil, leading to a fluorinated analog that enhances both selectivity and potency against ROCK isoforms. Its synthesis involved the strategic incorporation of functional groups—including a fluorine substituent and a sulphonamide linkage—to target the catalytic domain of ROCK1 and ROCK2 with low nanomolar IC₅₀ values. As a member of the ROCK inhibitor family, ripasudil belongs to a class of compounds originally explored for vascular applications due to their capacity to modulate smooth muscle contraction by affecting actin cytoskeleton dynamics. In ophthalmology, this class has been repurposed to treat conditions in which aqueous humor outflow is compromised, such as glaucoma and ocular hypertension, by directly targeting the trabecular meshwork cells and altering their contractile properties (Garnock‐Jones, 2014; Chang & Wang, 2014).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of ripasudil is distinguished by its use in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma. Initially developed for vascular indications, ROCK inhibitors soon attracted attention when preclinical studies demonstrated their ability to relax trabecular meshwork (TM) cells by reducing actomyosin contraction. Ripasudil has undergone extensive clinical evaluation, culminating in its approval in Japan in 2014 for patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Multiple phase II and phase III clinical trials, such as those reported in clinical studies and post‐marketing observational data, have confirmed its ocular hypotensive efficacy and a favorable safety profile with mainly transient adverse effects like conjunctival hyperemia (Garnock‐Jones, 2014; Tanihara et al., 2015). ROCK inhibitors as a drug class have additionally been evaluated in other ocular conditions, with clinical trials extending their use into applications such as Fuchs endothelial dystrophy, diabetic retinopathy, and corneal endothelial wound healing. Moreover, the growing repository of clinical trial registrations—including those indexed under Clinical Trials Search: Ripasudil OR rho kinase inhibitor glaucoma and specific trial identifiers such as NCT02174991 and NCT06048380—demonstrates ongoing efforts to validate the therapeutic efficacy and broaden the clinical applications of ripasudil in glaucoma management (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
Ripasudil exerts its therapeutic effect by selectively inhibiting the activity of ROCK1 and ROCK2, two serine/threonine kinases that play critical roles in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, contractility, and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization in ocular tissues. Under physiological conditions, activation of ROCK—often downstream of RhoA GTPase—leads to phosphorylation of key substrates such as myosin light chain (MLC) and myosin light chain phosphatase inhibitory proteins, thereby promoting actomyosin contraction. In the trabecular meshwork, this results in increased cell stiffness, enhanced focal adhesions, and greater deposition of fibrotic ECM components such as collagen and fibronectin, all contributing to increased outflow resistance and elevated IOP (Chang & Wang, 2014; Rao, Pattabiraman, & Kopczynski, 2017). By inhibiting ROCK activity, ripasudil decreases MLC phosphorylation, leading to relaxation of the trabecular meshwork cells and reduction in cellular contractility. This relaxation is accompanied by morphological changes including disassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions, which together result in diminished ECM secretion. The net effect is an increased aqueous humor outflow through the conventional drainage pathway (trabecular meshwork and Schlemm’s canal), leading to a reduction in IOP (Pagano et al., 2023; Tanihara et al., 2015). Mechanistic studies in cell culture and animal models have provided direct evidence that ROCK inhibition normalizes outflow facility by counteracting the pathological stiffness of TM cells, confirming the essential role of ROCK‐mediated cytoskeletal dynamics in regulating IOP (Ochoa et al., 2023; Chang & Wang, 2014).

Expected Effect:
In the context of glaucoma, the expected outcome of ripasudil administration is a significant reduction in IOP mediated through normalization of trabecular meshwork function. The proposed assay would involve testing ripasudil on cultured human trabecular meshwork cells where ROCK1 and ROCK2 are endogenously expressed; these proteins have been confirmed as being present in these cells, as evidenced in biochemical studies and expression profiles described in the literature (Rao et al., 2017; Pagano et al., 2023). By inhibiting these kinases, ripasudil is anticipated to reduce actomyosin‐generated contractile tension and decrease ECM protein secretion. In vitro, this would be reflected by reduced stress fiber formation, decreased focal adhesion assembly, and normalization of junctional proteins such as ZO‐1 and cadherin, which are crucial for maintaining cellular barrier properties and tissue architecture. The consequent biological effect is an increased outflow of aqueous humor which, if translated in vivo, manifests clinically as a reduction in IOP (Garnock‐Jones, 2014; Chang & Wang, 2014). Preclinical studies in animal models, particularly in non‐human primates and rabbits, have already demonstrated that topical administration of ripasudil induces a rapid, dose‐dependent decline in IOP, which is congruent with its mechanism of action of decreasing trabecular resistance. Clinically, ripasudil eye drops have been shown to provide significant IOP reduction, with peak effects observed within 1–2 hours post‐dose and sustained efficacy over several hours, thereby aligning with the expectations of improved aqueous humor dynamics (Tanihara et al., 2015; Wang, Wang, & Dang, 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Taking into account the detailed mechanistic insights, established clinical efficacy, and favorable safety profile of ripasudil, this therapeutic candidate has substantial promise for the treatment of glaucoma. The principal strength of ripasudil lies in its mechanistic specificity: by directly targeting ROCK1 and ROCK2, it addresses the fundamental pathophysiology of increased outflow resistance at the trabecular meshwork—an aspect not adequately targeted by many traditional glaucoma therapies that focus predominantly on aqueous production or non‐conventional outflow pathways (Garnock‐Jones, 2014; Chang & Wang, 2014). Its ability to modulate cytoskeletal tension and reduce ECM deposition translates into an additive therapeutic strategy that can be used either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents such as timolol or latanoprost. The clinical validation, evidenced by the approval in Japan and numerous phase II/III trials demonstrating significant IOP reductions, further supports its efficacy. Additionally, the well‐characterized pharmacokinetic profile in ocular tissues—with rapid ocular penetration and an acceptable systemic exposure profile—enhances its appeal as a repurposed candidate, as it builds upon an existing regulatory dossier that streamlines repositioning for additional indications or combinations (Garnock‐Jones, 2014; Tanihara et al., 2015).

Nonetheless, some weaknesses warrant consideration. The most frequently reported adverse event is transient conjunctival hyperemia, which, although generally mild, has been noted across several clinical trials. This side effect may impact patient compliance over long‐term use, especially if used as a standalone therapy. Furthermore, although the mechanism of ROCK inhibition is well‐established in preclinical models, there remains some variability in clinical responses among different subpopulations of glaucoma patients, such as those with secondary or refractory glaucomas, which could influence the generalizability of its efficacy (Freiberg et al., 2022; Pagano et al., 2023). Moreover, while the existing data have predominantly been generated in Japanese populations, additional studies would be beneficial to further characterize its performance in more ethnically diverse cohorts.

Another consideration is the potential for combination therapies; while additive effects have been demonstrated when ripasudil is combined with standard agents (e.g., beta blockers or prostaglandin analogues), the long‐term safety and efficacy of such combinations in routine clinical settings still need further validation in larger, multicenter studies. Nonetheless, ongoing and planned clinical trials, as indexed by various ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers including those for glaucoma and corneal applications (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023), continue to expand our understanding of ROCK inhibitors’ therapeutic window and versatility in ophthalmology.

Overall, the evidence strongly supports ripasudil’s utility in modulating aqueous humor dynamics by acting on the trabecular meshwork. The compound’s established role in reducing IOP through ROCK inhibition, its favorable ocular safety profile, and its potential additive benefits when used alongside conventional glaucoma treatments make it a highly promising candidate for repurposing within the glaucoma therapeutic arena. It addresses a critical unmet need by directly improving outflow facility, thereby reducing the primary risk factor for glaucoma progression—elevated intraocular pressure. In summation, while minor adverse events and potential inter‐individual variability present challenges, the strengths of ripasudil in terms of its mechanistic rationale, clinical experience, and regulatory pedigree provide a strong foundation for its continued and expanded use in the management of glaucoma (Garnock‐Jones, 2014; Tanihara et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2023).
