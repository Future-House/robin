Proposal for Galunisertib (LY2157299).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Galunisertib (LY2157299) is a synthetically derived, small‐molecule inhibitor designed to target the transforming growth factor‐beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway with a high degree of specificity. It was developed using structure‐based drug design approaches aimed at inhibiting the kinase activity of the TGF-β receptor type I (TGF-βRI), also referred to as ALK5. Galunisertib belongs to the class of TGF-β receptor kinase inhibitors, a group of compounds originally developed to intervene in pathologic fibrosis, cancer progression, and other disorders characterized by dysregulated TGF-β signaling. The design of galunisertib hinges on its ability to bind competitively to the ATP pocket of TGF-βRI’s intracellular kinase domain. This binding prevents autophosphorylation of the receptor and blocks subsequent phosphorylation of downstream signal transducers such as SMAD2 and SMAD3. Early compounds in this class, exemplified by SB431542, demonstrated that selective inhibition of TGF-βRI could be achieved, although many were limited to preclinical investigations. Galunisertib represents an evolution of this concept and has been optimized with improvements in oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties (Lahn et al., 2015; Kaminska & Cyranowski, 2020). In addition, its chemical synthesis and optimization have been guided by extensive preclinical work demonstrating potent and selective inhibition of TGF-β signaling, which has significant implications for conditions driven by fibrotic remodeling. The decision to focus on a TGF-β receptor kinase inhibitor is based on the broad role of TGF-β in mediating fibrosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition across a range of tissues, a concept that has been extensively validated in cancer and fibrotic diseases (Danielpour, 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Galunisertib has most notably been evaluated in oncology settings over the past decade, with a series of clinical trials ranging from Phase I dose-escalation studies to more advanced Phase II trials in cancer patients. Initially tested in malignancies such as malignant glioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, metastatic breast cancer, and castration-resistant prostate cancer, galunisertib showed the capacity to inhibit the TGF-β–mediated fibrotic stroma, reduce tumor-associated immunosuppression, and modulate cytokine expression. In these settings, its clinical development was designed around an intermittent dosing schedule (typically 14 days on followed by 14 days off) to mitigate potential toxicities, such as cardiotoxicity, that have been associated with continuous TGF-β blockade (Lahn et al., 2015). Although galunisertib’s use in glaucoma has not been clinically assessed, the underlying mechanism—targeting TGF-βRI to suppress downstream fibrosis—has been implicated in ocular disorders. In primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), TGF-β2 is elevated in the aqueous humor and is known to promote fibrosis in the trabecular meshwork (TM) by upregulating ECM gene transcription and enhancing actomyosin contractility (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Belmares et al., 2018). The fact that TGF-β receptor kinases have been successfully targeted in systemic fibrotic and oncologic conditions makes galunisertib an attractive candidate for repurposing. Recent clinical trial searches (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) have revealed a growing translational interest in testing TGF-β inhibitors for glaucoma, particularly focusing on fibrotic ocular phenotypes. This evolving body of evidence from preclinical and clinical oncology studies provides a strong rationale for evaluating galunisertib in a new therapeutic context such as glaucoma.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, TGF-β signaling is initiated by the binding of one of the TGF-β isoforms (TGF-β1, TGF-β2, or TGF-β3) to TGF-β receptor type II (TGF-βRII) on the cell membrane. This ligand-receptor interaction results in the recruitment and hetero-oligomerization with TGF-β receptor type I (TGF-βRI/ALK5), forming a functional receptor complex. Subsequent phosphorylation of TGF-βRI by TGF-βRII triggers an intracellular cascade whereby TGF-βRI phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMAD proteins (R-SMADs), primarily SMAD2 and SMAD3. These phosphorylated SMADs then form complexes with SMAD4 and translocate into the nucleus where they regulate the transcription of genes responsible for ECM production (including collagens and fibronectin) and proteins involved in actomyosin contractility (Lahn et al., 2015; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012). Galunisertib exerts its pharmacological effect by binding directly to the ATP-binding pocket within the kinase domain of TGF-βRI. This occupation of the ATP-binding site prevents the catalytic activity necessary for receptor autophosphorylation and subsequent SMAD phosphorylation. As a result, galunisertib effectively halts both the canonical SMAD-dependent pathway and affects noncanonical TGF-β signaling pathways such as those mediated by MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and Rho-like GTPases (Mitra et al., 2020; Hachana & Larrivée, 2022). These pathways are critically involved in cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which are key drivers of fibrotic remodeling. The inhibitory effect of galunisertib is thus focused on a central node of the TGF-β signaling network, allowing for targeted suppression of pathological fibrosis while ideally preserving other essential cellular functions. Laboratory studies in oncology have demonstrated that treatment with galunisertib reduces phosphorylated SMAD2 levels, which correlates with a decrease in the transcription of pro-fibrotic genes (Lahn et al., 2015; Ogata et al., 2024). This mechanistic insight underpins the hypothesis that using galunisertib could downregulate fibrotic gene expression in trabecular meshwork cells and thereby improve the outflow of aqueous humor in patients with glaucoma.

Expected Effect:
In the pathogenesis of glaucoma, particularly POAG, an overactive TGF-β2 signaling cascade within the trabecular meshwork leads to excessive deposition of ECM components (collagen, fibronectin, etc.) and elevation of actomyosin contractility. These changes cause stiffening of the trabecular meshwork and reduced aqueous humor outflow, which ultimately elevates intraocular pressure (IOP) (Belmares et al., 2018; Callaghan et al., 2022). The expectation from applying galunisertib in this setting is that its selective inhibition of TGF-βRI will lead to a significant reduction in SMAD2/3 phosphorylation in trabecular meshwork cells. This should, in turn, decrease transcription of fibrotic ECM genes and reduce actomyosin contractility. The net effect would be the softening of trabecular meshwork tissue, restoration of normal aqueous humor outflow, and a concomitant reduction in IOP. Preclinical evidence from tissue models has shown that when TGF-β2 levels are experimentally elevated, trabecular meshwork remodeling and IOP increase occur. Conversely, approaches that block TGF-β signaling—using neutralizing antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, or small molecule inhibitors—have been associated with decreased fibrotic changes in ocular tissues and improved outflow facility (Hachana & Larrivée, 2022; Parichatikanond et al., 2020). Furthermore, clinical data from oncology trials of galunisertib have demonstrated that its use results in measurable reductions in phosphorylated SMAD2, providing a translational biomarker that supports its antifibrotic efficacy (Lahn et al., 2015; Ogata et al., 2024). While direct studies in glaucoma models are not yet available, the comprehensive pharmacological data support the hypothesis that galunisertib would reduce trabecular meshwork fibrosis, lower IOP, and thereby slow or halt the progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

Overall Evaluation:
From an expert drug development perspective, galunisertib represents a compelling candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic strategy for glaucoma. One of its key strengths lies in its selective inhibition of TGF-βRI kinase activity, which has been thoroughly validated in preclinical and clinical settings in oncology and systemic fibrotic diseases (Lahn et al., 2015; Mitra et al., 2020). By targeting the ATP-binding site of TGF-βRI, galunisertib reliably prevents the phosphorylation and activation of SMAD2/3, thereby interfering with the transcriptional regulation of genes that drive pathological ECM deposition and actomyosin contractility. This mechanistic specificity is directly aligned with the pathological processes known to increase intraocular pressure in glaucoma (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Belmares et al., 2018).

Another significant strength is the robust clinical development history of galunisertib in oncology. Extensive Phase I and Phase II clinical trials have established its human PK/PD profile and highlighted its tolerability when administered intermittently. This body of data not only provides substantial evidence of its safety in humans but also offers critical insights into dosing regimens that might be adapted for ocular administration. Its oral bioavailability is advantageous for systemic treatment; however, this characteristic will need to be re-evaluated for ocular delivery where localized high concentrations in the trabecular meshwork are necessary. Formulation strategies such as topical eye drops, sustained-release implants, or intracameral injections may need to be optimized to ensure adequate tissue penetration without eliciting significant systemic exposure (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

While the engineered specificity of galunisertib reduces the risk of off-target effects, one potential limitation is the pleiotropic role of TGF-β in normal cellular and immune functions. TGF-β is important for maintaining tissue homeostasis and regulating wound healing. Thus, prolonged or excessive inhibition of TGF-β signaling in the eye could theoretically impair normal reparative processes or lead to unforeseen side effects. Nonetheless, the intermittent dosing regimens that have been effective in oncology might mitigate these risks in an ocular application (Lahn et al., 2015).

Moreover, although there is a solid mechanistic rationale and substantial supporting data from preclinical and clinical research in other indications, direct evidence for the efficacy of galunisertib in glaucoma is currently lacking. This gap underscores the need for targeted preclinical studies using ocular models, such as ex vivo perfused anterior segment organ cultures and in vivo animal models, to evaluate its effects specifically on trabecular meshwork fibrosis and IOP regulation. The promising data from other fibrotic conditions and ocular surface disorders, where TGF-β signaling has been successfully modulated, provide a strong impetus for these investigations (Hachana & Larrivée, 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In addition to the efficacy considerations, formulation and delivery challenges represent a critical translational hurdle. The systemic dosing regimens established in oncology may not translate directly into ophthalmic use due to differences in pharmacokinetics and tissue barriers in the eye. Innovative drug delivery platforms specifically designed for ocular therapeutics will be key to enabling galunisertib to reach and exert its effects within the trabecular meshwork at therapeutic concentrations.

Overall, the extensive preclinical data and the strong clinical safety and PK/PD profiles of galunisertib position it as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in glaucoma therapy. Its mechanism—targeted inhibition of TGF-β receptor type I kinase, resulting in reduced SMAD2/3 activation and subsequent downregulation of fibrotic gene expression—addresses the fundamental pathological processes that contribute to trabecular meshwork fibrosis and elevated intraocular pressure. If the challenges associated with ocular drug delivery can be overcome, galunisertib has the potential to offer a disease-modifying treatment option for glaucoma that moves beyond traditional symptomatic IOP-lowering therapies (Lahn et al., 2015; Ogata et al., 2024).

Given these considerations, the next critical steps would include:
1. Conducting detailed preclinical studies in ex vivo and in vivo models of glaucoma to establish the efficacy of galunisertib in reducing TM fibrosis and lowering IOP.
2. Developing and optimizing ocular-specific formulations, whether topical or via sustained-release delivery systems, to achieve significant drug concentrations in the trabecular meshwork without incurring systemic side effects.
3. Designing early-phase clinical trials that incorporate biomarkers for TGF-β signaling (e.g., phospho-SMAD2 levels) in aqueous humor and trabecular meshwork tissue to establish target engagement and define the therapeutic window in the ocular context.

In conclusion, the repurposing of galunisertib for glaucoma is scientifically well-founded based on its molecular mechanism, comprehensive safety data from oncology trials, and the established role of TGF-β in TM fibrosis. Despite challenges related to targeted delivery and the need for ocular-specific efficacy data, galunisertib’s mode of action offers a precise anti-fibrotic approach that could restore outflow facility and reduce intraocular pressure. The convergence of evidence from biochemical, clinical, and translational studies strongly supports advancing galunisertib into dedicated ophthalmic investigations, which may ultimately pave the way for a novel, disease-modifying treatment for glaucoma patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Hachana & Larrivée, 2022; Parichatikanond et al., 2020).
