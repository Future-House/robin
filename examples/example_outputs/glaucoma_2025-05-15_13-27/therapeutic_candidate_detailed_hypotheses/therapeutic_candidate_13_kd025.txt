Proposal for KD025 (SLx-2119), a selective ROCK2 inhibitor.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
KD025, also known as SLx-2119 or Belumosudil, is a small molecule that was developed through medicinal chemistry optimization with the goal of achieving selective inhibition of Rho-associated coiled‐coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2). As a synthetic compound, KD025 belongs to the class of kinase inhibitors, a group of molecules designed to target and modulate specific enzymes involved in intracellular signaling. ROCK inhibitors in general have been extensively investigated for their role in modulating contractility, cytoskeletal dynamics, fibrosis, and immune responses, with several compounds already in clinical use for diverse indications. In the case of KD025, the design strategy was focused on maximizing selectivity toward ROCK2, thereby reducing the off‐target effects—such as vascular hypotension and ocular hyperemia—that are frequently associated with nonselective or ROCK1/ROCK2 dual inhibitors. This molecular fine‐tuning is achieved by exploiting subtle differences in the ATP-binding pocket of ROCK2 relative to ROCK1, leading to an inhibitor that not only attenuates phosphorylation events downstream of ROCK2 but also potentially limits adverse pharmacodynamic effects observed with other compounds in this class (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
KD025’s clinical development history has largely focused on immune‐mediated and fibrotic conditions. In multiple phase 1 and phase 2 trials, KD025 has been tested for safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers and patients with conditions such as chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) and psoriasis. For instance, clinical trial identifiers NCT02106195 and NCT05918614 document studies where Belumosudil was evaluated in subjects with immune dysregulation and fibrotic disorders, providing a substantial foundation regarding its systemic safety and bioavailability (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014a; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014b). Although ROCK inhibitors such as ripasudil and netarsudil have an established record in treating ocular hypertension and glaucoma, KD025 itself has not been directly tested or approved for ocular diseases. Nonetheless, the growing body of literature supporting the relevance of ROCK pathways in modulating trabecular meshwork physiology has prompted interest in repurposing KD025 for glaucoma. The rationale stems from the fact that other ROCK inhibitors, which target both ROCK1 and ROCK2 isoforms, have successfully demonstrated efficacy in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) through relaxation of the trabecular meshwork. Therefore, while KD025’s therapeutic history has predominantly been in the realm of immune modulation and antifibrotic therapy, early-phase pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerability data in healthy subjects indicate that its safety profile could make it a promising candidate for repurposing to treat glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014a; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014b).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, KD025 functions by selectively inhibiting ROCK2. ROCK2 is one of the two isoforms (the other being ROCK1) that are downstream effectors of the Rho family of small GTPases. When activated, ROCK2 phosphorylates several substrates, including myosin light chain (MLC) and the myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), leading to enhancement of actomyosin contractility. The increased phosphorylation of MLC results in the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions that contribute to cellular contractility and rigidity. In the context of glaucoma, this contractile behavior in trabecular meshwork (TM) cells is a key contributor to increased outflow resistance for aqueous humor, thereby elevating IOP. By selectively inhibiting ROCK2, KD025 is anticipated to reduce MLC phosphorylation, leading to disassembly of stress fibers, relaxation of TM cells, and attenuation of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. This cascade of effects theoretically improves aqueous humor outflow. In addition to decreasing cell contractility, ROCK2 inhibition has been associated with anti‐fibrotic and anti‐inflammatory effects; these may reduce pathological tissue remodeling and scarring that can occur after glaucoma filtration surgeries (Liu et al., 2024, pp. 4–5; Wu et al., 2024, pp. 4–5). The underlying biochemical interactions include the binding of KD025 to the catalytic domain of ROCK2 in an ATP-competitive manner, which prevents the phosphorylation of downstream effectors critical for maintaining a contractile cytoskeletal framework. Although direct structural details about how KD025 distinguishes between ROCK2 and ROCK1 are beyond the provided context, the conceptual framework is well supported by studies showing that selective inhibition of ROCK2 can dampen fibrotic signaling and cellular contractility while offering a potentially improved side effect profile relative to less selective inhibitors (Kim et al., 2021, pp. 2–3).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis driving the repurposing of KD025 for glaucoma management is centered on its ability to selectively reduce ROCK2-mediated contractility in the trabecular meshwork cells. In conventional in vitro assays using primary human TM cells or model systems, KD025 is expected to decrease the phosphorylation levels of MLC, leading to disassembly of actin stress fibers and reduced cell contractility. This molecular action should translate into a relaxation of the TM, effectively lowering resistance to aqueous humor outflow. By diminishing ECM deposition and fibrotic remodeling, KD025 could further optimize the tissue architecture of the TM, contributing to sustained IOP reduction. Importantly, ROCK2 is known to be expressed in TM cells, and studies using other ROCK inhibitors have demonstrated that modulation of ROCK signaling in the TM is a viable route for lowering IOP (Liu et al., 2024, pp. 11–12; Wu et al., 2024, pp. 4–5). The additional benefit of KD025’s selectivity lies in its potential to minimize adverse vascular effects, such as ocular hyperemia and systemic hypotension, which have been noted with nonselective inhibitors that target both ROCK isoforms. Thus, the anticipated effect is a targeted improvement in aqueous humor outflow due to relaxed TM cell contractility and reduced ECM deposition, without the unwanted side effects commonly associated with broader ROCK inhibition (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
The prospect of repurposing KD025 for glaucoma therapy is scientifically compelling based on several interrelated factors. First, its selective inhibition of ROCK2 addresses key pathophysiological processes in the trabecular meshwork, namely increased cellular contractility and ECM deposition, which are central to aqueous humor outflow resistance and elevated IOP. These mechanistic insights are supported by preclinical research demonstrating that ROCK inhibitors can modulate the cytoskeleton and contractility of TM cells, thereby improving outflow facility (Liu et al., 2024, pp. 4–5; Wu et al., 2024, pp. 4–5). Second, the robust safety and tolerability data from KD025’s use in systemic fibrotic and immune-mediated disorders provide a solid foundation for its potential redeployment in ophthalmology. The engineered selectivity toward ROCK2 may yield a favorable safety profile with fewer systemic vascular side effects—an important consideration when the therapeutic target is the delicate vascular and contractile function of the eye (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014b; Kim et al., 2021, pp. 2–3). Third, although KD025 has not been previously used for ophthalmic indications, the extensive clinical experience with other ROCK inhibitors in glaucoma—such as ripasudil and netarsudil, which have demonstrated efficacy in lowering IOP—lends credence to the hypothesis that selective ROCK2 inhibition could have similar or even improved efficacy with reduced side effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Liu et al., 2024, pp. 2–4).

Nevertheless, there are also key challenges and weaknesses that must be addressed. The primary limitation is the lack of direct preclinical or clinical evidence for KD025 specifically in ocular models or glaucoma patients. Most of the available data derive from studies in systemic diseases or preclinical fibrosis models. As such, the translatability of these findings to the ocular environment remains uncertain. Moreover, while the hypothesis that selective ROCK2 inhibition will reduce vascular side effects is attractive, it is possible that the inhibition of ROCK2 alone may not fully recapitulate the multifaceted effects observed with nonselective ROCK inhibitors, which might be necessary for optimal IOP reduction in some patient populations. Additionally, the precise contributions of ROCK1 and ROCK2 in TM physiology are still not completely delineated, and it may be that sufficient modulation of aqueous outflow requires combined inhibition of both isoforms. Finally, the competitive landscape in glaucoma drug development is crowded, with several approved agents and new compounds continuously emerging. Therefore, any new candidate such as KD025 will need to demonstrate clear advantages over existing therapies in terms of efficacy, safety, or both, before it can justify the investment in additional clinical trials (Liu et al., 2024, pp. 4–5; Kim et al., 2021, pp. 2–3).

In summary, KD025 (SLx-2119) represents a promising therapeutic candidate for glaucoma based on its well-understood mechanism of selective ROCK2 inhibition, its ability to potentially reduce contractility and fibrotic remodeling in trabecular meshwork cells, and its favorable systemic safety profile observed in other disease contexts. The strengths of KD025 include its molecular specificity, which may translate to fewer vascular side effects and improved tolerability, and its mechanism of action, which directly targets pathophysiological mechanisms known to contribute to increased IOP. However, the primary weaknesses lie in the current absence of direct evidence for ocular efficacy and the need for further research to fully elucidate the role of ROCK2 in TM regulation relative to ROCK1. The next steps should involve focused preclinical studies using ex vivo human TM models and in vivo animal models of glaucoma to directly evaluate KD025’s impact on IOP, TM cell dynamics, and ECM remodeling. Such studies, in conjunction with optimized drug delivery strategies to the eye, will be essential to determine whether KD025 can fulfill its promise as a repurposed therapy for glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Liu et al., 2024, pp. 11–12; Wu et al., 2024, pp. 4–5).

Overall, the repurposing of KD025 for glaucoma is scientifically justified and meritorious, yet it requires a well-planned translational development program that addresses existing gaps in the direct ocular evidence base. Continued research in this direction could eventually provide a novel therapeutic option that offers both effective IOP reduction and an improved side-effect profile compared to current ROCK inhibitors and conventional glaucoma medications (Kim et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014b).
