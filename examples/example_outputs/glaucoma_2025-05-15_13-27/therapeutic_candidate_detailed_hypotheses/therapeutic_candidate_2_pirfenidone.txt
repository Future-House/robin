Proposal for Pirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich cat. P2116).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich cat. P2116) is a small synthetic pyridone derivative that was originally discovered and developed as an antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory agent. Its chemical design centers on a pyridone ring, which confers its unique biochemical properties through interaction with key signaling molecules involved in fibrotic processes. As a representative member of the small molecule antifibrotic class, pirfenidone has been extensively investigated for its ability to modulate cytokines, growth factors, and downstream signaling pathways that drive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. The synthesis of pirfenidone has been refined over decades of research, with chemical routes emphasizing high purity and reproducibility in generating the active pyridone moiety. Its development was originally aimed at conditions where fibrosis played a central role in disease progression, such as in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and its approval by regulatory authorities for IPF underscores its robust antifibrotic activity (Jahnke et al., 2024; Unknown Reference). As a member of the antifibrotic agent class, pirfenidone’s mechanism of action involves widespread inhibition of profibrotic mediators and has already been deployed in a number of systemic fibrotic disorders. This class of compounds has traditionally been used to reduce the progression of pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and cytokine production, thereby reducing tissue scarring and preserving organ function (Schaefer et al., 2011).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, pirfenidone was developed and clinically validated for its efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a severe and progressive lung disease characterized by excessive deposition of collagen and other ECM proteins. In preclinical and clinical studies, pirfenidone has demonstrated the capacity to reduce fibroblast proliferation, inhibit synthesis of collagen I and fibronectin, and downregulate transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling—an essential pathway implicated in fibrosis in multiple organ systems (Schaefer et al., 2011). Over the years, its safety and tolerability in human patients have been extensively documented, leading to regulatory approval in Europe and the United States for IPF management. In addition to IPF, pirfenidone has been evaluated in several fibrotic conditions affecting the kidney, liver, and heart. Notably, its antifibrotic effects have been observed in ocular contexts as well. Preclinical studies in animal models relevant to ophthalmology, particularly in rabbit and rat models of glaucoma filtration surgery, have provided evidence that pirfenidone can reduce postoperative scarring and maintain lower intraocular pressure (IOP) by limiting fibrotic encapsulation around implants (Park & Jung, 2016; Unknown Reference). Although no large-scale clinical trials have yet definitively assessed pirfenidone in glaucoma patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), the wealth of evidence demonstrating its antifibrotic capabilities in various preclinical settings offers promising translational potential for repurposing this drug in glaucoma, a disease in which ECM remodeling and fibrotic changes in the trabecular meshwork are critical pathologic features (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, pirfenidone exerts its antifibrotic activity through modulation of multiple signaling cascades, with a primary focus on inhibiting the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) pathway. TGF-β is a master regulator of fibrosis and has been shown to stimulate fibroblast proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation, and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen I and fibronectin. Pirfenidone interferes with TGF-β signal transduction by blocking the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad3—a critical intracellular mediator of TGF-β signaling (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Schaefer et al., 2011). By attenuating Smad3 phosphorylation, pirfenidone effectively reduces the transcription of profibrotic genes, including those coding for connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), collagen I, and fibronectin. This results in a reduced myofibroblast phenotype, as evidenced by lowered expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and diminished extracellular matrix remodeling. In addition, pirfenidone modulates other profibrotic mediators by downregulating various cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), further contributing to its overall antifibrotic profile (Jahnke et al., 2024; Park & Jung, 2016). The compound’s ability to interfere with TGF-β signaling is not limited to the lungs; rather, its suppression of Smad3 phosphorylation, CTGF expression, and ECM components has been observed in multiple cell types, including human retinal pigment epithelial cells and orbital fibroblasts. This broad spectrum activity underpins pirfenidone’s potential beneficial effects in ocular tissues where pathological fibrosis adversely affects aqueous humor outflow (Schaefer et al., 2011; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012).

Expected Effect:
Based on the established mechanism of action, the hypothesis for repurposing pirfenidone in glaucoma is that it will inhibit TGF-β–induced collagen I and fibronectin synthesis in human trabecular meshwork fibroblasts by blocking Smad3 phosphorylation and reducing CTGF expression. In a planned assay, treatment of cultured human trabecular meshwork fibroblasts with pirfenidone is expected to result in a significant reduction in profibrotic markers, including lower levels of collagen I and fibronectin as measured by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. This reduction in ECM component production should correlate with decreased fibroblast contractility and a reversion of the myofibroblast phenotype, thereby leading to less ECM stiffening and improved aqueous humor outflow. Given that human trabecular meshwork fibroblasts are known to express high levels of TGF-β receptors and respond robustly to TGF-β stimulation with increased Smad3 phosphorylation and upregulation of CTGF (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Hassan et al., 2023), pirfenidone’s action at these molecular nodes is expected to be both potent and therapeutically relevant. The anticipated cellular phenotype following pirfenidone treatment would be characterized by decreased activation of the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway, resulting in a lower profibrotic gene expression profile and reduced ECM deposition, as has been demonstrated in other fibrotic cell types and animal models (Jahnke et al., 2024; Park & Jung, 2016). This cellular outcome is expected to translate into improved trabecular meshwork flexibility and enhanced aqueous humor outflow in vivo, thereby contributing to IOP reduction—a principal goal in glaucoma management (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Faralli et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
In our evaluation of pirfenidone as a repurposed drug candidate for glaucoma, several strengths and potential weaknesses emerge. On the strength side, pirfenidone benefits from a well-established safety and tolerability profile based on extensive clinical use in pulmonary fibrosis and other fibrotic conditions. Its known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, characterized by rapid tissue penetration and clearance in ocular tissues following topical administration, provide a strong rationale for its repurposing in eye diseases (Unknown Reference; Unknown Reference). The drug’s mechanism of action, centered on inhibition of TGF-β/Smad3 signaling and downstream reduction of collagen I, fibronectin, and CTGF expression, directly targets the pathological processes known to drive trabecular meshwork fibrosis in glaucoma (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Prendes et al., 2013). Preclinical data from both retinal and glaucoma-related animal models have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing postoperative scarring and maintaining lower intraocular pressures, which underscores its potential applicability in glaucoma therapy (Park & Jung, 2016; Jahnke et al., 2024). Additionally, the versatility of pirfenidone in modulating profibrotic cytokines and ECM remodeling provides a significant advantage over current cytotoxic antifibrotic agents such as mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil, which have been associated with adverse side effects (Schaefer et al., 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The translational potential is further bolstered by the fact that TGF-β signaling pathways, as well as CTGF and ECM components like collagen and fibronectin, are not only critical in lung fibrosis but also play analogous roles in ocular fibrosis, particularly within the trabecular meshwork and in scar formation following glaucoma filtration surgery (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Hassan et al., 2023).

In terms of weaknesses, despite the promising preclinical evidence, there remains a paucity of direct clinical data or large-scale studies specifically examining pirfenidone’s efficacy and safety in glaucoma patients. Many of the studies supporting its potential have been conducted in animal models or in vitro systems using non-ocular cell types, which introduces uncertainty regarding its precise efficacy in human trabecular meshwork fibroblasts and its long-term impact on aqueous humor dynamics (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hu et al., 2021). Moreover, while the molecular mechanisms of action are well characterized, the optimal dosing regimen, delivery method (topical versus systemic), and potential ocular toxicity require further rigorous evaluation in well-designed preclinical ocular studies and subsequent clinical trials. Another potential challenge is the complexity of glaucoma pathophysiology itself; although ECM remodeling in the trabecular meshwork is a critical contributor to increased IOP, other factors such as neurodegeneration and vascular dysregulation also play significant roles. Thus, while targeting fibrotic processes may improve outflow facility, it may need to be combined with other therapeutic strategies to comprehensively address glaucoma progression (Hachana & Larrivée, 2022; Murphy-Ullrich & Downs, 2015). Furthermore, from a drug development perspective, repurposing an oral antifibrotic agent for ocular use necessitates rigorous formulation development to ensure tissue-specific delivery and sustained pharmacological action in the anterior segment of the eye. Although early pharmacokinetic studies in animal models have shown promising ocular penetration and a favorable safety profile in terms of local irritation, these findings must be validated in human studies to fully assess the clinical utility of pirfenidone in glaucoma (Unknown Reference; Lv et al., 2020).

Overall, pirfenidone stands out as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of glaucoma owing to its well-documented antifibrotic properties, established clinical safety profile in systemic fibrotic diseases, and clear mechanistic link to the TGF-β/Smad3/CTGF signaling axis that underlies fibrotic changes in the trabecular meshwork. The expected benefit of reducing ECM stiffening and contractility in the trabecular meshwork to restore aqueous humor outflow addresses a fundamental pathogenic mechanism in glaucoma. In light of the preclinical evidence supporting its use—such as reduced post-surgical scarring and IOP maintenance in animal models—and the molecular rationale based on inhibition of key profibrotic mediators, further development of pirfenidone for ocular antifibrotic therapy is justified. Nevertheless, additional studies are warranted to refine the delivery system, confirm efficacy in human trabecular meshwork cells, and establish the long-term safety and therapeutic impact in clinical glaucoma populations. Overall, the strengths in mechanistic specificity and established pharmacological profile appear to outweigh the challenges, rendering pirfenidone a compelling candidate for further investigation in the context of glaucoma (Jahnke et al., 2024; Park & Jung, 2016; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Hassan et al., 2023).
