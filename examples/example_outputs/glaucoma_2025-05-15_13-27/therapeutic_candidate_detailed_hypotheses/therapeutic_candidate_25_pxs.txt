Proposal for PXS-5153A, a small-molecule LOXL2 inhibitor.

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of PXS-5153A as a promising therapeutic candidate for glaucoma. In this report, we review its chemical origin and classification, summarize its therapeutic history in fibrotic and cancer models, detail its molecular mechanism of action, discuss the expected effect on trabecular meshwork (TM) physiology, and provide an overall evaluation of its strengths and potential weaknesses when repurposed for glaucoma treatment.

────────────────────────
Overview of Therapeutic Candidate

PXS-5153A is a synthetically derived small‐molecule inhibitor that belongs to the fluoroallylamine class of mechanism‐based compounds targeting the lysyl oxidase family. In particular, this molecule has been designed to inhibit lysyl oxidase‐like 2 (LOXL2) as well as LOXL3. Its chemical design is rooted in extensive medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at overcoming the limitations seen with earlier LOX inhibitors such as β‐aminopropionitrile (BAPN) and with antibody therapeutics like Simtuzumab. Unlike BAPN—which showed nonspecificity and toxicity—and the much larger antibody-based inhibitors that suffered from poor tissue penetration, PXS-5153A is engineered to provide both oral bioavailability and improved access to target tissues. Its molecular structure is built around a fluoroallylamine moiety that, upon binding within the enzyme’s active site, undergoes a fluoride elimination reaction. This triggers the formation of a reactive intermediate that irreversibly covalently modifies the lysyl tyrosylquinone (LTQ) cofactor of LOXL2, effectively “locking” the enzyme in an inactive state (Cano et al., 2023; Smithen et al., 2019).

This candidate was uncovered in research programs originally focused on anti-fibrotic and anti-tumor strategies. The fluoroallylamine-based inhibitors were developed to maximize potency and selectivity for LOXL2’s catalytic domain while minimizing off-target interactions. Compared to earlier LOXL2 inhibitors (including antibody-based approaches and earlier small molecules), PXS-5153A is characterized by a small molecular weight that enhances its potential for penetrating dense extracellular matrices (ECMs) such as those found in the trabecular meshwork of the eye. Because the TM’s biomechanical properties are dictated in part by the degree of collagen crosslinking, a small molecule like PXS-5153A carries the promise of reaching these tissues and altering the pathogenic extracellular matrix remodeling processes behind glaucomatous pathology (Romero et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022).

The synthetic origin of PXS-5153A permits iterative structure–activity relationship (SAR) modifications that can further improve its bioavailability, solubility, tissue distribution, and specificity. This feature is particularly important in an ophthalmic context, where the properties of the drug must be finely tuned to overcome barriers such as the blood–ocular barrier and to ensure that only the diseased tissue is affected without disrupting normal ocular homeostasis (Smithen et al., 2019).

────────────────────────
Therapeutic History

The therapeutic history of LOXL2 inhibitors as a class has largely been focused on addressing pathological fibrosis and tumor stroma formation. PXS-5153A has been evaluated in several preclinical models of fibrotic disease, such as liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride exposure and myocardial infarction models. In these studies, administration of PXS-5153A led to significant reductions in hydroxyproline content—a reliable biomarker for collagen deposition—and a measurable improvement in tissue architecture and elasticity (Romero et al., 2020; Vallet & Ricard-Blum, 2019). This therapeutic history underscores the central hypothesis that inhibiting LOXL2-mediated collagen crosslinking can reverse or mitigate the progression of fibrosis.

In the oncology space, LOXL2 inhibitors have been explored for their ability to modulate tumor microenvironments. LOXL2 plays an important role in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix within tumors, thereby facilitating cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Preclinical studies demonstrated that small molecule inhibitors of LOXL2 could delay tumor growth by reducing the density and stiffness of the tumor stroma (Cano et al., 2023; Findlay et al., 2019). These findings have contributed to the broader understanding that abnormal collagen crosslinking is a universal factor across a spectrum of fibrotic and neoplastic diseases.

When it comes to ocular applications, specifically glaucoma, there is as yet no published clinical trial data directly linking PXS-5153A or any other LOXL2 inhibitor to improved outcomes in glaucoma patients. However, several preclinical observations and theoretical models offer a compelling rationale for repurposing these agents in glaucoma. For instance, the Open Targets data indicates a potential, albeit low, association between LOXL2 and glaucoma-related disease processes (Ochoa et al., 2023). Given that excessive LOXL2 activity contributes to fibrosis in diverse tissues, and because the trabecular meshwork (TM) in glaucoma is characterized by increased collagen crosslinking and stiffness, there is a strong conceptual and biochemical rationale to explore the role of PXS-5153A in normalizing TM tissue properties (Cano et al., 2023).

Moreover, earlier clinical trials with other LOXL2 inhibitors, such as antibody therapeutics like Simtuzumab, failed to show efficacy due to challenges with sufficient target inhibition and poor tissue penetration (Perryman & Gray, 2022). The small-molecule nature of PXS-5153A is expected to overcome these drawbacks. In systemic fibrotic diseases like myelofibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, trials of similar LOXL2 inhibitors (for example, PAT-1251 or GB2064) reached early stages, providing additional proof-of-concept that effective LOXL2 inhibition can translate into clinical effects. Although these trials were not performed in the context of glaucoma, they contribute to the general therapeutic history that supports the hypothesis (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021).

────────────────────────
Mechanism of Action

PXS-5153A exerts its pharmacological action by irreversibly inhibiting the catalytic activities of LOXL2 and LOXL3. Under normal physiological conditions, LOXL2 serves as a copper-dependent amine oxidase responsible for the oxidative deamination of lysine and hydroxylysine residues in collagen and elastin fibers. This biochemical transformation produces reactive aldehyde groups on collagen molecules that subsequently undergo spontaneous condensation reactions to form covalent crosslinks. These crosslinks are essential for imparting mechanical stability and tensile strength to the extracellular matrix (Romero et al., 2020).

The irreversible inhibition provided by PXS-5153A is achieved through a two-step mechanism. First, the inhibitor binds non-covalently and positions itself within the catalytic pocket of LOXL2 where it interacts with the LTQ cofactor—a crucial prosthetic group required for the enzyme’s activity. Once positioned correctly, the fluoroallylamine moiety of PXS-5153A undergoes a chemical transformation; specifically, it eliminates a fluoride ion, generating a highly reactive intermediate. This reactive species then covalently bonds with specific amino acid residues in the active site of LOXL2, causing permanent inactivation of the enzyme’s catalytic function (Smithen et al., 2019; Romero et al., 2020).

The dual targeting of both LOXL2 and LOXL3 is particularly important. In complex biological systems, inhibition of a single lysyl oxidase isoform may provoke compensatory upregulation of other family members. By concurrently inhibiting LOXL2 and LOXL3, PXS-5153A minimizes the risk of redundancy and helps ensure a more complete suppression of collagen crosslinking activity. This dual inhibition strategy has been shown in preclinical models to lead to a significant reduction in hydroxyproline levels—an indicator of collagen deposition—and improvement in tissue compliance (Cano et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022).

At the biochemical level, this inhibition is “mechanism-based” because the inhibitor exploits the natural catalytic mechanism of the enzyme itself. Once the covalent adduct is formed, LOXL2 remains in an inactive state until new enzyme molecules are synthesized by the cell. This characteristic renders the inhibitory effect long lasting relative to reversible inhibitors. The use of activity-based probes in these studies has further confirmed that PXS-5153A achieves high levels of target engagement at low nanomolar concentrations, suggesting that the inhibitor is both potent and selective for its intended targets (Findlay et al., 2019).

Given that the pathology in fibrotic diseases and the aberrant biomechanics of the trabecular meshwork in glaucoma are both driven by excessive collagen crosslinking, the molecular details underpinning PXS-5153A’s mechanism make it particularly attractive for use in ocular conditions. The enzyme’s catalytic domain is highly conserved in TM cells, and preliminary immunohistochemical studies suggest that members of the lysyl oxidase family, including LOXL2, are expressed in the trabecular meshwork (Yemanyi, 2020). It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that the same mechanism leading to reduced collagen crosslinking in liver or lung fibrosis could be applied to the TM in an ocular setting.

────────────────────────
Expected Effect in Glaucoma

The central hypothesis for repurposing PXS-5153A in glaucoma is that by inhibiting LOXL2-mediated collagen crosslinking, the drug will reduce the stiffness of the trabecular meshwork ECM—a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. In a healthy eye, the trabecular meshwork plays a key role in regulating intraocular pressure (IOP) by facilitating the outflow of aqueous humor. In glaucomatous eyes, increased deposition and crosslinking of collagen in the TM leads to tissue stiffening, which in turn increases the resistance to aqueous humor outflow and elevates IOP. Elevated IOP is known to be a major risk factor for the progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

Preclinical models of other fibrotic diseases have clearly demonstrated that inhibition of LOXL2 using PXS-5153A reduces hydroxyproline content and improves the biomechanical properties of tissues (Romero et al., 2020). Extrapolating these findings to the ocular context, administration of PXS-5153A is expected to lead to a decrease in the formation of new collagen crosslinks within the trabecular meshwork, thereby reducing tissue stiffness. With reduced stiffness, the TM should become more compliant and better able to facilitate aqueous humor drainage, ultimately resulting in lower intraocular pressure (Yemanyi, 2020).

Furthermore, the expected benefits extend beyond mere alterations in tissue biomechanics. The trabecular meshwork is not a static structure; it is highly responsive to mechanical cues. In a stiffened TM, mechanotransductive signaling pathways are activated in a manner that promotes a feed-forward loop of cellular contraction and further fibrotic remodeling. By reducing collagen crosslink density and normalizing the ECM, PXS-5153A may interrupt these abnormal signaling cascades. A decrease in the mechanical stress experienced by TM cells could lead to reduced cellular contraction, diminished secretion of pro-fibrotic factors (such as TGF-β1), and ultimately, a more homeostatic cellular environment. These changes could help stabilize or even reverse the pathological outflow resistance characteristic of glaucomatous eyes.

On a molecular level, the inhibition of LOXL2 is thought to benefit the TM by preventing the establishment of excessive covalent crosslinks among collagen fibrils. Such crosslinking not only increases stiffness but also influences the organization and alignment of collagen fibers. It is anticipated that treatment with PXS-5153A would promote remodeling of the ECM to a state that more closely resembles that of a non-diseased TM. In effect, the drug may contribute to a restoration of the normal dynamic range of tissue elasticity that is crucial for proper function. This restorative potential is directly related to the irreversible mode of inhibition exhibited by PXS-5153A; once LOXL2 is inactivated, the turnover of collagen will eventually lead to a softer ECM structure, assuming that new collagen is secreted in the absence of excessive crosslinking (Romero et al., 2020).

It is also important to note that while the expected outcomes are derived from robust preclinical data in non-ocular models, extrapolation to the eye requires careful consideration of ocular pharmacokinetics and tissue-specific dynamics. The small-molecule nature of PXS-5153A is advantageous in this regard because it allows for potential formulations that can achieve therapeutically effective concentrations in the anterior segment of the eye. Localized delivery methods such as topical eye drops or intravitreal injections may be explored to maximize target tissue exposure while minimizing systemic side effects. The concept of repurposing an agent with known anti-fibrotic activity finds support in the existing literature, where increased LOXL2 expression correlates with fibrotic changes in multiple tissues, including those in the eye implicated in glaucoma pathology (Ochoa et al., 2023; Yemanyi, 2020).

Given that trabecular meshwork cell contraction, coupled with aberrant ECM remodeling, is a critical driver of increased IOP, the anticipated effect of PXS-5153A is to yield improved aqueous outflow facility. This, in turn, should manifest clinically as a reduction in IOP—a primary therapeutic goal in managing glaucoma. Moreover, by addressing the underlying biomechanical abnormalities rather than merely modulating fluid dynamics pharmacologically (as is the case with many current glaucoma therapies), PXS-5153A may offer a disease-modifying approach that could slow or even halt the progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

────────────────────────
Overall Evaluation

The preclinical and biochemical profile of PXS-5153A is compelling when evaluated against the backdrop of glaucoma pathology. One of the principal strengths of this candidate lies in its small-molecule design. This inherently improves its likelihood of penetrating the dense extracellular matrix of the trabecular meshwork—a challenge that has historically limited the efficacy of larger biologic compounds such as monoclonal antibodies (Cano et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022).

Another significant strength of PXS-5153A is its irreversible, mechanism-based inhibition of LOXL2 (and LOXL3). By permanently inactivating these enzymes through covalent modification of the LTQ cofactor, the drug ensures sustained reduction in collagen crosslinking until new enzymes are synthesized. This long-lasting inhibition is particularly attractive in a chronic condition such as glaucoma, where continuous suppression of pathological ECM remodeling may be required to achieve enduring clinical benefits (Smithen et al., 2019; Romero et al., 2020).

Furthermore, the dual inhibition of LOXL2 and LOXL3 can be considered a strategic advantage. Inhibition of a single isoform might trigger compensatory upregulation of related enzymes; by concurrently targeting both isoforms, PXS-5153A may preempt such compensatory mechanisms and thereby provide a more complete normalization of extracellular matrix structure and function. This is particularly important in the trabecular meshwork, where even minor alterations in tissue biomechanics can have marked effects on aqueous humor outflow and IOP regulation (Cano et al., 2023).

Despite these promising attributes, several concerns must be acknowledged. The most significant challenge is the lack of direct preclinical data specifically demonstrating the efficacy of PXS-5153A in ocular models of glaucoma. While the compound has shown marked anti-fibrotic activity in liver, lung, and myocardial models, the trabecular meshwork’s unique anatomical and biochemical environment necessitates a focused evaluation. Detailed studies are required to confirm the expression of LOXL2 in the TM and to assess the degree to which LOXL2-driven collagen crosslinking contributes to the pathologically increased stiffness observed in glaucomatous eyes (Yemanyi, 2020; Ochoa et al., 2023).

Another potential limitation is associated with ocular pharmacokinetics. It is not yet known whether systemic administration of PXS-5153A, or even localized ocular delivery, will achieve sufficiently high concentrations in the trabecular meshwork to effect meaningful biochemical changes. The eye is known to have several barriers that can limit drug penetration, such as the corneal epithelium and blood–aqueous barrier. Formulation development, therefore, will be a crucial step in ensuring that the compound reaches the intended target without causing significant off-target toxicity. Detailed studies exploring absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) within the ocular environment will be indispensable for the future clinical translation of this therapy (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021).

Additionally, while the inhibition of LOXL2 is hypothesized to be beneficial in reducing TM stiffness, it is possible that LOXL2 plays a role in normal ocular homeostasis. Physiological levels of collagen crosslinking are necessary for maintaining the structural integrity of the trabecular meshwork and other ocular tissues. Over-inhibition might, in theory, compromise the normal biomechanical properties required for proper function. This potential safety concern needs to be rigorously investigated in both in vitro and in vivo models before PXS-5153A can be considered safe for ocular use.

From a translational standpoint, the strength of PXS-5153A lies in its foundation on robust preclinical data from other fibrotic models. This history provides a solid scientific rationale for its repurposing to treat glaucoma. Many of the mechanisms that drive fibrosis in systemic tissues are conserved in ocular tissues. Moreover, the emerging consensus from the literature suggests that pathological remodeling of the trabecular meshwork—a process driven by aberrant collagen crosslinking—is a critical contributor to increased outflow resistance and elevated IOP. Therefore, by targeting LOXL2, PXS-5153A promises an innovative approach that differs markedly from existing glaucoma therapies that mainly target aqueous humor dynamics (Romero et al., 2020; Yemanyi, 2020).

The current landscape of glaucoma therapy is dominated by agents that either reduce the production of aqueous humor or improve outflow through pharmacological or surgical means. However, these treatments typically address the symptom of elevated IOP rather than correcting the underlying pathological remodeling of the trabecular meshwork. PXS-5153A, by contrast, offers the possibility of a disease-modifying treatment that works at the molecular level to restore TM biomechanics. This could not only reduce IOP more sustainably but might also slow or reverse the progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy by altering the disease’s etiological driver.

There is also evidence that supports the translational feasibility of using LOXL2 inhibitors in ocular tissues. Several studies have demonstrated that members of the lysyl oxidase family are expressed in ocular tissues, including the trabecular meshwork, where they may influence ECM homeostasis. In this context, the inhibition provided by PXS-5153A is expected to be beneficial if its formulation and delivery can be optimized to achieve sufficient local concentration. Overall, the strategy of repurposing a potent anti-fibrotic agent like PXS-5153A for glaucoma is appealing because it aims at the very root cause of mechanical outflow resistance—the abnormal extracellular matrix—rather than providing symptom-only relief (Ochoa et al., 2023; Yemanyi, 2020).

Nonetheless, the need for robust ocular-specific preclinical studies cannot be overstated. First, it will be essential to establish that LOXL2 is sufficiently expressed in the glaucomatous trabecular meshwork relative to normal tissue. Secondly, the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of PXS-5153A must be characterized in ocular tissues to define the optimal dosing regimen that achieves effective target engagement without detrimental side effects. Ocular toxicity studies and evaluations of any potential adverse effects on physiological ECM remodeling in benign tissues, such as the corneal stroma, will also be critical for a safe therapeutic profile.

────────────────────────
Overall Conclusions and Future Directions

In summary, PXS-5153A exhibits a well-documented anti-fibrotic mechanism of action through its irreversible inhibition of LOXL2 and LOXL3. Its small-molecule nature confers significant advantages in terms of tissue penetration and the possibility of localized ocular delivery. The extensive preclinical evidence from systemic fibrotic disease models provides a compelling rationale for its repurposing as a glaucoma therapeutic by targeting the pathological extracellular matrix remodeling in the trabecular meshwork.

The strengths of PXS-5153A include:
• Its rational, mechanism-based design that exploits the copper-dependent catalytic activity of LOXL2 to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme, thereby reducing pathological collagen crosslinking (Smithen et al., 2019; Romero et al., 2020).
• Its dual inhibition of LOXL2 and LOXL3, which minimizes the risk of compensatory upregulation of other lysyl oxidase family members, ensuring a more complete suppression of extracellular matrix stiffening (Cano et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022).
• Its favorable chemical properties as a small molecule, permitting potential ocular formulations that can overcome the blood–ocular barriers and specifically target the trabecular meshwork.
• Its robust preclinical profile in fibrosis models, which lends substantial credence to the hypothesis that similar mechanisms contribute to trabecular meshwork stiffening in glaucoma (Romero et al., 2020; Yemanyi, 2020).

Conversely, the potential weaknesses or challenges include:
• A current lack of direct evidence from ocular or glaucoma-specific preclinical models to confirm that LOXL2 plays a similarly pivotal role in the trabecular meshwork as it does in liver or lung fibrosis.
• The need to rigorously characterize ocular pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to ensure that effective drug concentrations are achieved in the trabecular meshwork without eliciting adverse effects on normal ocular tissues.
• The possibility that LOXL2 may be involved in the maintenance of normal ECM homeostasis in the eye; thus, an overly potent inhibition could theoretically disrupt necessary physiological processes if not properly controlled.
• The necessity to develop an optimal delivery method—whether through systemic administration with adequate ocular penetration or via localized delivery strategies such as eye drops or intraocular injections—to maximize therapeutic benefits while minimizing systemic exposure.

Future directions for advancing PXS-5153A as a candidate for glaucoma will involve several key steps. Initially, in vitro studies utilizing human trabecular meshwork cells should be conducted to measure LOXL2 expression levels, collagen crosslinking rates, and the biomechanical properties of the ECM in response to PXS-5153A treatment. These studies will help establish whether LOXL2 inhibition can effectively remodel the pathological ECM characteristic of glaucomatous tissue. In parallel, in vivo studies in animal models of glaucoma are needed to assess ocular pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, and the impact on IOP reduction. Given the compound’s promising anti-fibrotic effects in other models, pilot studies focusing on aqueous humor outflow facility and TM stiffness measurements would be critical.

Moreover, research should explore formulation strategies that optimize the delivery of PXS-5153A into the anterior segment of the eye. Advances in nanotechnology, liposomal delivery systems, or other ocular drug delivery platforms may be leveraged to enhance local drug concentration without significant systemic absorption. Safety profiles will need to be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any adverse effects on the cornea, lens, or retinal tissues; only then can the compound progress toward Phase I clinical evaluation for ocular indications.

In conclusion, PXS-5153A represents a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of glaucoma owing to its potent, irreversible inhibition of LOXL2/LOXL3, its demonstrated efficacy in reducing extracellular matrix crosslinking in fibrotic models, and its amenable small-molecule properties that suggest potential for ocular tissue penetration. While its application to glaucoma remains hypothetical pending further targeted preclinical studies, the underlying mechanistic rationale is sound. With rigorous investigation into TM-specific pharmacodynamics, ocular safety, and appropriate delivery modalities, PXS-5153A could emerge as a novel, mechanism-based therapy offering a disease-modifying approach to glaucoma—shifting the treatment paradigm from symptomatic IOP reduction to addressing the underlying biochemical drivers of the disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021; Ochoa et al., 2023; Cano et al., 2023; Romero et al., 2020; Smithen et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022; Yemanyi, 2020).

────────────────────────
Conclusion

The extensive literature reviewed herein provides a robust scientific framework for considering PXS-5153A as a candidate for repurposing in glaucoma treatment. Its synthetic origins, belonging to the fluoroallylamine class, and its irreversible, dual inhibition of LOXL2/LOXL3 are strongly supported by preclinical data from non-ocular fibrotic models. The potential to modulate ECM stiffness via inhibition of collagen crosslinking aligns directly with the mechanistic theories underlying trabecular meshwork dysfunction in glaucoma.

While current clinical data focus primarily on fibrotic diseases and cancer, the parallels between tissue fibrosis in systemic organs and pathological changes in the trabecular meshwork suggest that a similar therapeutic benefit could be realized in the eye. However, several critical gaps remain. Ocular-specific pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological studies must be conducted to validate that PXS-5153A can reach and effectively modulate the TM without adversely affecting normal ocular function.

Overall, the repurposing of PXS-5153A for glaucoma offers a compelling opportunity to address the pathological ECM remodeling that underpins elevated intraocular pressure. With further focused preclinical studies and subsequent clinical trials, this small-molecule LOXL2 inhibitor has the potential to transform our approach to glaucoma therapy—moving toward disease modification through biochemical normalization of the trabecular meshwork.

In light of the promising preclinical antifibrotic activity, the demonstrated efficacy of similar agents in other disease models, and the mechanistic rationale linking LOXL2 activity to ECM stiffness, PXS-5153A stands out as a strong candidate for addressing a critical unmet need in glaucoma treatment. Its future success, however, will depend on close interdisciplinary collaboration and rigorous validation across ocular models before advancing to clinical evaluation (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021; Ochoa et al., 2023; Romero et al., 2020; Smithen et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022; Yemanyi, 2020).

────────────────────────
Final Remarks

To summarize, PXS-5153A’s unique chemical design, mechanism of irreversible LOXL2 inactivation, and proven anti-fibrotic efficacy in preclinical systems collectively support its potential for repurposing in glaucoma therapy. The working hypothesis that reducing LOXL2-driven collagen crosslinking in the trabecular meshwork could lower tissue stiffness and improve aqueous humor outflow is well grounded in current biochemical and pathophysiological knowledge. Challenges remain, particularly in establishing ocular bioavailability and ensuring that vital physiological ECM functions are not compromised—but these challenges are not insurmountable. With continued preclinical validation, optimization of ocular delivery, and interdisciplinary collaboration, PXS-5153A could offer a first-in-class, mechanism-based treatment modality that directly targets the pathogenic cascade of glaucomatous disease rather than merely treating its symptomatic consequences.

In conclusion, this evaluation supports further investigation into PXS-5153A as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma. If successful, this strategy could not only reduce intraocular pressure but also modify underlying tissue pathology, providing a significant advancement in the management of a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021; Ochoa et al., 2023; Romero et al., 2020; Smithen et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022; Yemanyi, 2020).
