Proposal for MitoQ, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MitoQ is a synthetic, mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant that was developed through the conjugation of the naturally occurring antioxidant ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10) to the lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) cation. This modification was designed to exploit the high negative membrane potential of mitochondria, leading to an accumulation of MitoQ in the mitochondrial matrix at concentrations hundreds of times greater than those in the cytosol. The TPP⁺ moiety serves as a carrier enabling the compound to cross phospholipid membranes with high efficiency, while the ubiquinone portion functions as a redox‐active antioxidant. As a member of the mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant class, MitoQ is conceptually related to other TPP‐conjugated molecules such as SkQ1 and MitoTEMPO; these compounds have been primarily used to counteract oxidative stress in tissues where mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a pivotal role in the pathology of disease (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Broome et al., 2018).

Therapeutic History:
MitoQ has been evaluated in multiple preclinical and clinical studies addressing conditions principally linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive ROS production. In clinical settings, MitoQ has been administered to patients with diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and chronic hepatitis C, and it has been further investigated in trials involving vascular dysfunction and aging‐related decline. In these studies, chronic oral supplementation with MitoQ—typically in doses around 20 mg per day—has been shown to improve endothelial function, reduce markers of oxidative stress, and enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics, with an overall favorable safety profile (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Broome et al., 2018). Although no direct clinical studies have yet evaluated MitoQ for glaucoma per se, several preclinical investigations have focused on the effects of mitochondrial‐targeted antioxidants in ocular tissues. Notably, studies conducted using human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells have demonstrated that mitochondrial‐targeted antioxidants can attenuate TGF-β2–mediated signaling which is a well-known driver of fibrosis in the TM (Rao et al., 2019; Buffault et al., 2020). These findings provide a rationale that the repurposing of MitoQ for glaucoma is both mechanistically plausible and translationally attractive, given the manifold evidence that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction underpin the initiation of fibrotic cascades via TGF-β activation in several tissues (Rao et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
MitoQ’s mechanism of action is rooted in its selective accumulation within mitochondria due to the TPP⁺ moiety, which is driven by the strong negative mitochondrial membrane potential (typically between −150 mV and −180 mV). Once within the mitochondrial matrix, MitoQ is reduced by components of the electron transport chain—specifically complex II (succinate dehydrogenase)—into its active antioxidant form, MitoQH₂. In this reduced form, MitoQ is capable of scavenging various reactive oxygen species, including superoxide and peroxynitrite, and it prevents lipid peroxidation by neutralizing free radicals in close proximity to the inner mitochondrial membrane (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Broome et al., 2018).

At the molecular level, the antioxidant action of MitoQ involves a cyclical redox reaction. MitoQH₂, once formed, reacts with mitochondrial ROS and becomes oxidized back to the ubiquinone form; it is then continuously recycled by the respiratory chain. This “rechargeable” nature means that MitoQ can provide sustained protection against oxidative insults without being depleted rapidly, making it more effective than conventional antioxidants that lack such targeting or recycling capabilities. In the context of glaucoma, oxidative stress in trabecular meshwork cells is known to activate latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), thereby triggering downstream pro-fibrotic signaling cascades including the canonical SMAD pathway as well as noncanonical pathways involving RhoA/ROCK. TGF-β activation leads to increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and ultimately, increased outflow resistance which is a key factor driving elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary open-angle glaucoma. By reducing mitochondrial ROS levels, MitoQ is expected to interfere with the initial oxidative activation of latent TGF-β, thereby preventing the subsequent cascade of SMAD phosphorylation and RhoA/ROCK-mediated fibrosis (Rao et al., 2019). This mechanism is particularly relevant as studies in TM cells have indicated that mitigating oxidative stress can blunt the fibrotic response and improve the cellular homeostasis necessary for proper aqueous humor outflow (Zhang et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
The proposed hypothesis is that MitoQ, by its direct antioxidant action in the mitochondria of trabecular meshwork cells, will reduce the pertinent ROS burden that ordinarily triggers the oxidative activation of latent TGF-β. In turn, this reduction is expected to block the pro-fibrotic downstream signaling cascades. Specifically, by attenuating the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 proteins, MitoQ would diminish SMAD-dependent transcription of genes coding for extracellular matrix proteins, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and various collagens implicated in TM fibrosis. Furthermore, by moderating the activation of RhoA/ROCK pathways—which are responsible for actin stress fiber formation and increased cellular contractility—MitoQ could reduce the stiffness and contractility of the trabecular meshwork, ultimately enhancing aqueous humor outflow and lowering IOP (Rao et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2023).

Current in vitro studies using primary human TM cell cultures have demonstrated that TGF-β2-induced oxidative stress leads to increased ROS production, which is coupled with enhanced Smad phosphorylation, upregulated expression of ECM proteins such as collagen I and IV, and increased formation of actin stress fibers. Mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, including compounds like MitoQ, have been able to attenuate these effects, providing indirect evidence that the oxidative stress in TM cells is a key driver of the TGF-β-mediated fibrotic process (Rao et al., 2019). Additionally, recent literature underscores that antioxidants capable of specifically targeting mitochondrial ROS can prevent the feed-forward loop that normally exacerbates TGF-β activation and subsequent fibrosis (Zhang et al., 2024). Based on these mechanistic insights, it is expected that in assays involving cultured trabecular meshwork cells, treatment with MitoQ will result in a measurable reduction in ROS levels, decreased Smad2/3 phosphorylation, and a corresponding reduction in the expression of key fibrotic markers such as CTGF and collagens. Moreover, since the TGF-β pathway plays a central role in the pathology of glaucoma—by promoting ECM accumulation that impedes the outflow of aqueous humor—the expected cellular response to MitoQ is a restoration of TM cell homeostasis, decreased cell contractility, and ultimately improved aqueous outflow facility (Rao et al., 2019; Buffault et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating MitoQ as a therapeutic candidate for glaucoma, particularly with respect to its potential to ameliorate trabecular meshwork fibrosis via a mitochondrial oxidative stress mechanism, several key strengths and weaknesses emerge.

Among the primary strengths is the highly specific mechanism by which MitoQ acts. Its design as a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant allows it to accumulate within the precise cellular compartment where the majority of ROS are generated, thereby providing robust protection against oxidative damage at its source. This targeted approach not only increases the local concentration of the antioxidant in the mitochondria but also reduces the possibility of interfering with physiological ROS signaling in other cellular compartments—a limitation often encountered with non-targeted antioxidants. The ability of MitoQ to undergo redox cycling, allowing for continuous ROS scavenging, further enhances its therapeutic potential. These properties are well-documented in the context of various systemic conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and metabolic dysfunctions, where improvements in mitochondrial function have been observed following MitoQ supplementation (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Broome et al., 2018).

Another significant advantage is the extensive safety data associated with MitoQ. Multiple clinical trials evaluating the compound in conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and hepatitis C have demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with minimal adverse effects reported at therapeutically relevant doses. This history of safety in humans provides a strong basis for repurposing MitoQ for glaucoma, as any candidate for chronic eye disease must be well tolerated given the likely need for long-term administration (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Broome et al., 2018).

Furthermore, preclinical data specifically pertaining to trabecular meshwork cells indicate that mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants can interfere with TGF-β2 signaling—a key driver of the fibrotic changes underlying increased intraocular pressure in glaucoma. Studies conducted in vitro have shown that treatment with such antioxidants attenuates Smad-dependent transcription and reduces the expression of ECM proteins, thereby mitigating the fibrotic response in TM cells. This is a particularly compelling finding because it aligns directly with the central hypothesis: that by scavenging mitochondrial ROS, MitoQ will prevent the oxidative activation of latent TGF-β and block downstream fibrotic pathways (Rao et al., 2019; Buffault et al., 2020).

However, there are also notable weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. One of the primary limitations is the current lack of direct clinical evidence for the efficacy of MitoQ in treating glaucoma. Although preclinical models provide promising data, the absence of dedicated clinical trials or extensive in vivo studies examining its effects on ocular tissues means that the translational leap from bench to bedside remains unproven. Glaucoma is a multifactorial disease with complex pathophysiology, and while targeting oxidative stress appears promising, the precise impact of MitoQ on long-term IOP regulation and visual field preservation in patients remains to be validated (Rao et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2024).

Additionally, factors such as drug delivery and ocular bioavailability must be carefully considered. The pharmacokinetic profile of MitoQ in systemic circulation is relatively well established; however, ensuring that sufficient concentrations of the compound reach the trabecular meshwork poses a specific challenge. For an ocular therapeutic, formulations such as eye drops, intravitreal injections, or potentially targeted nanocarriers may be needed to achieve therapeutic levels in the TM cells. The limited direct evidence in ocular models necessitates further research on optimal dosing, delivery routes, and potential ocular-specific toxicities (Broome et al., 2018; Rao et al., 2019).

Moreover, while the antioxidant mechanism of MitoQ is well elucidated, there is some complexity regarding the dual role of ROS in the cell. Physiological levels of ROS are essential for normal cellular signaling, and complete suppression may interfere with necessary redox signaling pathways. Thus, careful titration of MitoQ dosing is critical to avoid potential adverse effects due to excessive ROS depletion, which could theoretically impair normal cellular functions—including those crucial for TM cell function (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Broome et al., 2018).

Another consideration is the potential variability in the response of TM cells to MitoQ. Given that trabecular meshwork cells may vary in their mitochondrial content, redox homeostasis, and susceptibility to oxidative stress, personalized or stratified approaches might be necessary to identify those patients most likely to benefit from MitoQ treatment. This variability could complicate clinical trial design and the generalization of results across a diverse patient population (Rao et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2024).

In summary, MitoQ represents a promising therapeutic candidate for glaucoma based on its targeted mechanism of action—specifically, its ability to accumulate in mitochondria, scavenge ROS, and thereby prevent the oxidative activation of latent TGF-β which is known to initiate fibrotic pathways via SMAD and RhoA/ROCK signaling in trabecular meshwork cells. The compound’s synthetic design, which builds on the natural antioxidant Coenzyme Q10, coupled with a well-documented safety profile in human studies of oxidative stress-related diseases, provides a solid foundation for exploring its repurposing in glaucoma. Preclinical data in TM cells are supportive; however, critical gaps remain in our understanding of its ocular pharmacokinetics, delivery, and long-term clinical efficacy in the treatment of glaucoma. Given these strengths and weaknesses, further studies—including targeted preclinical investigations using ocular models and early-phase clinical trials—are necessary to validate the therapeutic potential of MitoQ for managing glaucoma-induced trabecular meshwork fibrosis and improving aqueous humor outflow. The strategic repurposing of MitoQ leverages a validated redox-fibrosis axis with clear translational potential, but diligent work remains to be done to move this candidate from promising hypothesis to clinical reality (Rao et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Broome et al., 2018; Buffault et al., 2020).
