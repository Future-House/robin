Proposal for SIS3 (Sigma-Aldrich cat. S7665), a selective SMAD3 phosphorylation inhibitor.

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of SIS3 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SIS3 (Sigma-Aldrich cat. S7665) is a synthetic small molecule engineered to selectively inhibit phosphorylation of SMAD3, a key intracellular mediator of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling. The inhibitor was discovered through focused medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at identifying compounds that could bind to the MH2 domain of SMAD3, which is essential for its activation by type I TGF-β receptors. Unlike broad-spectrum TGF-β receptor inhibitors, SIS3 is designed to spare SMAD2 phosphorylation while specifically targeting SMAD3 activation. This degree of selectivity classifies SIS3 among a class of targeted antifibrotic agents that have been widely studied in experimental models of fibrosis. SIS3’s synthetic origin ensures that its production can be finely controlled with respect to purity and pharmacokinetic properties, attributes that are advantageous in drug development and repurposing efforts. Its chemical nature as a small molecule enhances cell membrane penetration and facilitates intracellular distribution, thereby permitting direct interaction with SMAD3 in human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells—a cell type critically involved in the regulation of aqueous humor outflow (Jinnin, Ihn, & Tamaki, 2006). The engineered specificity of SIS3 for the SMAD3 MH2 domain forms the basis for its therapeutic potential, particularly given that TGF-β–induced fibrotic responses in ocular tissues have been postulated to contribute to the pathological ECM deposition seen in glaucoma (Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, SIS3 has been used primarily as an experimental tool in preclinical studies to dissect the role of SMAD3 in fibrosis. In vitro investigations in human dermal fibroblasts have demonstrated that SIS3 potently blocks TGF-β1-induced SMAD3 phosphorylation, leading to a significant downregulation of profibrotic genes such as those for type I collagen, fibronectin, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (Jinnin et al., 2006). These studies have provided proof of concept for SIS3’s antifibrotic efficacy by showing that the compound can diminish myofibroblast differentiation and reduce the deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in fibrotic diseases such as scleroderma. Moreover, in experimental models of kidney fibrosis, including the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model, SIS3 has been shown to attenuate not only ECM deposition but also the associated inflammatory and apoptotic responses (Ji et al., 2018). Although these preclinical studies were carried out in non‐ocular systems such as dermal and renal tissues, they establish the mechanistic rationale for targeting SMAD3 in fibrotic conditions. Elevated levels of TGF-β2 in the aqueous humor have been documented in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, and studies using genome‐wide transcriptome profiling of human TM cells treated with TGF-β2 have demonstrated that SMAD3 is a key mediator driving a profibrotic gene expression profile in these cells (Callaghan et al., 2022). Additionally, investigations into the regulation of BMP genes and ECM production in TM cells further underscore the central role of SMAD3 in mediating fibrotic responses in glaucoma (Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022). Although SIS3 has not yet been directly tested in clinical or veterinary settings for glaucoma, the extensive preclinical evidence from other fibrotic models provides a strong rationale for its repurposing to target TM fibrosis, which contributes to increased intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucomatous eyes (Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009).

Mechanism of Action:
At the biochemical level, TGF-β signaling is initiated when TGF-β ligands bind to a heteromeric receptor complex comprised of type I and type II serine/threonine kinases. This binding event leads to the phosphorylation of downstream receptor-regulated SMAD proteins (R-SMADs) – primarily SMAD2 and SMAD3. Phosphorylation of SMAD3 occurs at conserved serine residues located in the C-terminal SSXS motif within its MH2 domain. Once phosphorylated, SMAD3 undergoes a conformational change that facilitates its association with SMAD4, forming a heteromeric complex that translocates into the nucleus and binds to specific DNA elements (such as the CAGA box) to activate the transcription of genes involved in ECM production—including genes encoding CTGF, various collagen isoforms, and fibronectin (Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009; Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022). SIS3 exerts its therapeutic effect by selectively binding to the SMAD3 MH2 domain, thereby blocking the phosphorylation event required for SMAD3 activation. This inhibition prevents SMAD3 from forming complexes with SMAD4 and from translocating to the nucleus. Importantly, the specificity of SIS3 means that it does not affect SMAD2 phosphorylation or other parallel signaling cascades such as those mediated by p38 MAPK or ERK, ensuring that only SMAD3-dependent profibrotic gene transcription is downregulated (Jinnin et al., 2006). In the pathological context of the human TM, elevated TGF-β2 signaling leads to SMAD3-mediated upregulation of ECM proteins, promoting fibrosis and increasing tissue stiffness. By inhibiting SMAD3 phosphorylation, SIS3 is expected to suppress the transcription of key fibrotic mediators such as CTGF and collagen, thereby reducing ECM accumulation. This targeted intervention interrupts the fibrotic cascade that underlies impaired aqueous humor drainage and elevated IOP in glaucoma (Callaghan et al., 2022; Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, treatment of human trabecular meshwork cells with SIS3 is expected to result in several beneficial outcomes. The primary effect is the blockade of SMAD3 phosphorylation, which in turn prevents the formation of the SMAD3–SMAD4 transcriptional complex and halts its nuclear translocation. This leads to a downregulation of ECM-related genes such as those encoding CTGF, collagen, and fibronectin—a profile that has been consistently observed in non–ocular cell types upon SIS3 treatment (Jinnin et al., 2006). In the trabecular meshwork, where elevated TGF-β2 levels drive a fibrotic gene expression profile, inhibition of SMAD3 signaling by SIS3 is anticipated to reduce ECM deposition and cellular contractility, thereby decreasing TM stiffness and improving aqueous humor outflow (Callaghan et al., 2022; Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022). Furthermore, recent studies have also implicated SMAD3 in mediating cellular senescence and oxidative stress in TM cells following glucocorticoid exposure, suggesting that SIS3 might not only reduce fibrotic ECM remodeling but also ameliorate senescence-associated phenotypes in these cells (Li et al., 2023a). Collectively, the expected net effect of SIS3 is a reduction in ECM accumulation and a restoration of a less fibrotic, more dynamic trabecular meshwork. In practical terms, this should translate into an improvement in aqueous humor drainage, leading to a reduction in IOP, which is the primary modifiable risk factor in glaucoma management (Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009; Callaghan et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Our overall evaluation of SIS3 as a repurposed candidate for glaucoma therapy is cautiously optimistic, as its molecular mechanism and preclinical antifibrotic profile strongly support its potential to counteract trabecular meshwork fibrosis. One of the principal strengths of SIS3 lies in its remarkable mechanistic specificity. By binding selectively to the SMAD3 MH2 domain and inhibiting its phosphorylation, SIS3 can effectively block a critical step in the TGF-β signaling cascade that is directly implicated in the pathological ECM deposition observed in glaucomatous trabecular meshwork (Jinnin et al., 2006). This targeted approach minimizes the risk of unintended interference with SMAD2-mediated signaling and other physiological processes, offering a potential safety advantage over less selective TGF-β pathway inhibitors (Jinnin et al., 2006).

The preclinical evidence establishing the antifibrotic effects of SIS3 in dermal fibroblasts and renal fibrosis models further bolsters the argument for its repurposing in glaucoma. Studies have shown that SIS3 not only reduces the expression of profibrotic genes such as collagen, fibronectin, and CTGF but also mitigates myofibroblast differentiation, a key contributor to tissue stiffness (Jinnin et al., 2006; Ji et al., 2018). Given that similar fibrotic mechanisms are observed in the trabecular meshwork of glaucomatous eyes—where TGF-β2 is elevated and drives SMAD3-dependent ECM remodeling—the rationale for employing SIS3 in this context is compelling (Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009; Callaghan et al., 2022; Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022).

Despite these strengths, several challenges need to be carefully addressed. To date, most of the supportive data for SIS3 derive from non-ocular models, and there remains a significant gap with respect to direct evaluation in human trabecular meshwork cells or glaucoma animal models. Although transcriptomic and biochemical studies have confirmed the importance of TGF-β/SMAD3 signaling in TM fibrosis (Callaghan et al., 2022; Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022), definitive proof that SIS3 can reduce ECM deposition and lower IOP in ocular tissues is still lacking. This necessitates rigorous preclinical studies in ocular model systems to establish both efficacy and safety in the context of glaucoma (Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009).

Another challenge pertains to ocular drug delivery. The eye is a sensitive organ with complex barriers that can complicate the delivery of small molecules to target tissues such as the trabecular meshwork. Optimizing a formulation that ensures adequate bioavailability of SIS3 within the TM—whether by topical administration, subconjunctival injection, or another route—will be critical to translating its preclinical antifibrotic effects into clinical benefit (Li et al., 2023a). In addition, given that SMAD3 is involved in multiple biological processes, complete inhibition of its activity might inadvertently perturb normal TGF-β functions that are essential for tissue homeostasis, immune regulation, and repair. Therefore, achieving an optimal therapeutic window that maximizes antifibrotic benefits while minimizing potential adverse effects will be essential (McDowell, Tebow, Wordinger, & Clark, 2013).

Moreover, glaucoma is a multifactorial disease. Although SMAD3-mediated ECM deposition represents a central mechanism contributing to increased outflow resistance in the TM, other pathways—such as those regulating oxidative stress, autophagy, and non-SMAD signaling (including Rho kinase pathways)—also play significant roles in the disease’s progression (Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022; Li et al., 2023b). As such, while selective inhibition of SMAD3 by SIS3 may provide substantial benefit in reducing TM fibrosis, it may need to be combined with other therapeutic strategies to comprehensively address the multifaceted pathology of glaucoma.

In summary, SIS3 offers a strong mechanistic basis as a targeted inhibitor of SMAD3 phosphorylation, and its antifibrotic effects in non-ocular models provide persuasive preliminary evidence supporting its potential repurposing for glaucoma therapy. Its anticipated effect in reducing the transcriptional activation of fibrotic genes in human trabecular meshwork cells is expected to curb ECM accumulation, lower cell contractility, and ultimately enhance aqueous humor drainage to reduce intraocular pressure. However, to fully validate SIS3 as a glaucoma therapeutic, additional studies must directly evaluate its efficacy in TM cells and relevant animal models, optimize ocular delivery methods, and carefully define its safety profile. These further investigations are essential for ensuring that the promising antifibrotic properties of SIS3 can be translated into improved clinical outcomes for glaucoma patients (Jinnin et al., 2006; Callaghan et al., 2022; Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Our evaluation of SIS3 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma is therefore cautiously optimistic. The compound’s strong mechanistic specificity—being able to selectively bind the SMAD3 MH2 domain and prevent its phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation—is ideally suited to counteracting TGF-β–driven fibrotic processes that impair trabecular meshwork function (Jinnin et al., 2006). Preclinical findings in non-ocular models, including dermal fibroblasts and kidney fibrosis models, robustly demonstrate that SIS3 decreases profibrotic gene expression and ECM deposition, effects that are directly translatable to the envisioned antifibrotic strategy in glaucoma (Ji et al., 2018; Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009). Moreover, transcriptome profiling of human TM cells under TGF-β2 exposure reaffirms the pivotal role of SMAD3 in mediating ECM accumulation, thereby strengthening the rationale for SIS3’s use in this setting (Callaghan et al., 2022; Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022).

Nonetheless, challenges remain that must be surmounted before advancing SIS3 through the glaucoma drug development pipeline. Key among these is the need for direct experimental validation in ocular tissues to confirm that SIS3 can lower IOP by improving aqueous humor outflow. Likewise, the development of an ocular delivery system that can achieve therapeutic concentrations within the trabecular meshwork without adverse effects on other ocular tissues is critical. Additionally, as TGF-β signaling fulfills various physiological roles, carefully balancing the inhibition of SMAD3 to avoid detrimental side effects will be imperative (McDowell et al., 2013; Li et al., 2023a). Finally, given glaucoma’s multifactorial nature, it is possible that SIS3 might eventually be used in combination with other agents—such as ROCK inhibitors—to address both fibrosis and other contributing pathogenic pathways (Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022; Li et al., 2023b).

In conclusion, while SIS3 is not yet clinically validated in the context of glaucoma, its selective inhibition of SMAD3 phosphorylation offers a promising strategy to mitigate TM fibrosis—a principal contributor to increased outflow resistance and elevated intraocular pressure in glaucoma. The extensive preclinical antifibrotic evidence, coupled with a strong mechanistic rationale, supports further investigation of SIS3 as a candidate for repurposing. Future studies should prioritize direct evaluation in trabecular meshwork cells and glaucoma animal models, ocular pharmacokinetic assessments, and formulation development to determine the feasibility of translating SIS3’s antifibrotic effects into clinically meaningful outcomes for patients with glaucoma (Jinnin et al., 2006; Callaghan et al., 2022; Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022).
