Proposal for Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Bardoxolone methyl, also known as CDDO‐Me, is a fully synthetic oleanane triterpenoid that was originally derived from the naturally occurring compound oleanolic acid found in various plants. It belongs to the class of synthetic triterpenoids, a group of compounds that have been engineered to improve on the natural structure for enhanced potency and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. These compounds are known for their ability to modulate redox homeostasis, regulate inflammation, and exert cytoprotective effects in various tissues. Bardoxolone methyl was discovered through chemical modification strategies that target electrophilic cysteine residues on regulatory proteins, and its design was optimized for potent Nrf2 activation. The development of this structural class has been motivated by a need for molecules that not only scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) directly but also upregulate a broad network of antioxidant enzymes via transcriptional activation. Therefore, Bardoxolone methyl represents a rationally designed compound intended to harness the endogenous cellular defense mechanism regulated by Nrf2 (Nakagami, 2016; Cheng et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Bardoxolone methyl’s therapeutic history is extensive; it has been clinically evaluated in several trials, particularly in chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes and in pulmonary arterial hypertension. It has demonstrated beneficial effects by improving estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and reducing systemic oxidative stress and inflammation in these conditions. The compound has also been explored in various oncological contexts due to its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects through Nrf2 activation. Although its safety profile has been established in non‐ocular settings, Bardoxolone methyl has not yet been directly tested in glaucomatous or ocular disease–specific clinical trials. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov for Bardoxolone methyl in glaucoma and ocular indications returned no registered trials, which suggests that while the clinical history in related systemic diseases is promising, its use in glaucoma remains entirely a repurposing hypothesis at this stage (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Batliwala et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the mechanistic rationale derived from its use in other oxidative stress–related diseases provides a strong preclinical basis to consider its evaluation for glaucoma, a disease closely linked to oxidative damage and fibrotic remodeling in the trabecular meshwork (TM) (Wang et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
Bardoxolone methyl’s mechanism of action centers on the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), which is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is held in the cytoplasm bound by its negative regulatory protein Keap1, which, via its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, targets Nrf2 for proteasomal degradation. Bardoxolone methyl exerts its effect by covalently modifying key cysteine residues on Keap1, thereby disrupting the Keap1-Nrf2 binding complex. This chemical modification prevents the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Nrf2. As a consequence, Nrf2 is stabilized in the cytoplasm, accumulates, and translocates into the nucleus where it binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) present in the promoter regions of target genes. This binding initiates the transcription of a battery of cytoprotective genes encoding antioxidant enzymes and phase II detoxification proteins such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase‐1 (HO‐1), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) and modifier (GCLM) subunits, and various glutathione S-transferases (Nakagami, 2016; Cheng et al., 2021).

Furthermore, Bardoxolone methyl’s activation of Nrf2 also exerts indirect anti-inflammatory actions by suppressing redox-sensitive signaling pathways such as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). The reduction in ROS levels following Nrf2 activation likely also prevents the ROS-mediated activation of latent pro-fibrotic cytokines, particularly transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). In glaucoma, TGF-β is implicated in the pathological remodeling and fibrosis of the trabecular meshwork, which contributes to increased outflow resistance and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). The inhibition of TGF-β activation through reduced oxidative stress represents a key molecular mechanism by which Bardoxolone methyl is hypothesized to preserve TM function (Nakamura et al., 2019; Arana et al., 2020).

In addition, Bardoxolone methyl has been reported to interact with other signaling pathways in various cell types. For example, cross-talk with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway has been observed where Nrf2 activation leads to modulation of PTEN activity—a lipid phosphatase that negatively regulates PI3K/AKT—thereby promoting cell survival and maintaining cytoskeletal integrity. This molecular interplay is critical in tissues susceptible to oxidative damage and may be particularly relevant for TM cells and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in glaucoma (Nakagami, 2016; Cheng et al., 2021). Thus, the well-documented molecular mechanism of Bardoxolone methyl highlights its capacity to induce a robust antioxidant and anti-fibrotic cellular response by activating Nrf2, which is expected to counteract the pathogenic cascade initiated by oxidative stress in glaucoma.

Expected Effect:
The working hypothesis for repurposing Bardoxolone methyl for glaucoma is that by activating Nrf2 in trabecular meshwork (TM) cells, the compound will upregulate endogenous antioxidant enzymes, thereby reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The reduction in ROS is expected to impair the ROS-mediated activation of latent TGF-β present in the TM. Since TGF-β is a potent pro-fibrotic cytokine that drives extracellular matrix remodeling and fibrosis in the TM, inhibiting its activation should help maintain the structural and functional integrity of the TM. Preservation of TM function is crucial for proper aqueous humor outflow, and thereby, for maintaining normal intraocular pressure (IOP). In addition, by mitigating oxidative stress, the drug is also anticipated to provide neuroprotective effects to retinal ganglion cells, which are vulnerable to oxidative and inflammatory damage in glaucoma (Wang et al., 2020; Arana et al., 2020).

Given that Nrf2 is expressed in ocular tissues, including TM cells and retinal ganglion cells, and that its activation has been associated with protection against oxidative damage in these cells, it is reasonable to expect that Bardoxolone methyl will induce similar effects in the eye. Experimental evidence from retinal models has shown that Nrf2 activation reduces superoxide levels and prevents vascular and neuronal degeneration (Wei et al., 2011; Naguib et al., 2021). Moreover, the expected upregulation of cytoprotective genes via the ARE pathway should lead to an increased antioxidant capacity locally within the TM. As a result, reducing the ROS burden would inhibit the feed-forward loop wherein ROS promotes TGF-β activation, which further exacerbates fibrosis and impairs aqueous outflow. This chain of events is critical because the pathological fibrosis of the TM is one of the major contributors to increased IOP in glaucoma (Rao & Stubbs, 2021). Thus, the use of Bardoxolone methyl is expected to yield a twofold benefit in glaucomatous eyes: maintenance of TM cell function and structure and neuroprotection of retinal ganglion cells through enhanced antioxidant defenses (Nakagami, 2016; Naguib et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Bardoxolone methyl stands out as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in glaucoma, owing to its robust mechanism of action and well-documented ability to activate the Nrf2 pathway. One significant strength of this candidate is its dual action, which targets both the antioxidant defense mechanisms and the fibrotic pathways underlying glaucomatous damage. By preventing ROS accumulation and subsequent TGF-β activation in trabecular meshwork cells, Bardoxolone methyl has the potential to preserve aqueous humor outflow and maintain IOP within normal ranges. This mechanistic approach directly addresses a validated pathogenic axis in glaucoma, given that oxidative stress and TM fibrosis are critical drivers of disease progression (Cheng et al., 2021; Rao & Stubbs, 2021).

Another strength is the extensive clinical and preclinical experience with Bardoxolone methyl in other indications. Its safety profile has been explored in chronic kidney disease and pulmonary hypertension, lending translational feasibility to the concept of repurposing it for glaucoma. Furthermore, the biochemical and molecular data demonstrating Bardoxolone methyl’s ability to upregulate antioxidant enzymes via Nrf2 activation in various models provides compelling rationale for its application in ocular tissues, which are likewise susceptible to oxidative injury (Nakagami, 2016; Matsuda et al., 2020).

However, there are inherent challenges and weaknesses that must be carefully considered. The lack of direct clinical or preclinical studies examining Bardoxolone methyl in glaucoma or ocular models leaves a significant gap in the evidence base; most of the supportive data are extrapolated from non-ocular contexts or from retinal studies that focus on neuroprotection rather than on trabecular meshwork function. The pharmacokinetics of Bardoxolone methyl, which were optimized for systemic diseases, may require further modification or targeted delivery strategies to achieve sufficient local concentrations in the eye while minimizing systemic exposure. Advanced drug delivery methods such as nanoformulations or intraocular implants may be necessary to overcome these hurdles (Cheng et al., 2021; Nakamura et al., 2019).

Additionally, although Bardoxolone methyl’s activation of Nrf2 has been shown to induce anti-inflammatory and antioxidative responses, the potential for off-target effects or adverse events, such as cardiovascular complications reported in some CKD trials, warrants caution. The safety profile in an ocular setting might differ, and thorough preclinical toxicology studies focused on ocular tissues and function will be essential. Furthermore, considering that oxidative stress and TGF-β signaling are complex and multifactorial processes in glaucoma, it is possible that monotherapy with Nrf2 activation may not be sufficient to halt disease progression; combination therapies targeting multiple pathogenic pathways might ultimately be more effective (Badla et al., 2024; Nakagami, 2016).

In summary, Bardoxolone methyl exhibits robust mechanistic promise owing to its potent activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway, leading to upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, inhibition of ROS-mediated TGF-β activation, and potential preservation of trabecular meshwork function in glaucoma. Its clinical history in other oxidative stress–driven diseases provides a strong foundation for repurposing, although the lack of direct ocular studies remains a challenge that would need to be addressed through targeted preclinical experiments and optimized drug delivery strategies. Overall, provided these hurdles are overcome through further research and development, Bardoxolone methyl could represent an innovative and promising therapeutic candidate for mitigating the oxidative and fibrotic aspects of glaucoma pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Nakagami, 2016; Wang et al., 2020).
