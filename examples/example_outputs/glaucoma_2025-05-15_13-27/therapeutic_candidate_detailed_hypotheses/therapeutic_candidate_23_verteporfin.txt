Proposal for Verteporfin.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Verteporfin is a benzoporphyrin derivative originally developed as a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in ocular diseases such as choroidal neovascularization associated with age‐related macular degeneration. As a member of the porphyrin class of compounds, verteporfin was discovered when researchers sought to develop agents capable of accumulating selectively in neovascular tissues and, upon activation with nonthermal red light, generating reactive oxygen species that damage the abnormal vasculature. Its synthetic origins involve modifications of the porphyrin ring to enhance its photophysical properties while ensuring preferential tissue uptake. Over time, subsequent investigations revealed that, independent of light activation, verteporfin exhibits off‐target inhibitory effects on key transcriptional coactivators, specifically Yes‐associated protein (YAP) and its paralog TAZ. This repositioning from a photosensitizer to a potential anti‐fibrotic agent is based on its ability to disrupt the YAP–TEAD (TEA domain) protein–protein interaction, thereby attenuating downstream gene transcription associated with cellular proliferation and fibrosis (Frömmichen et al., 2025; Sun et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Clinically, verteporfin has an established history in ophthalmology, being approved by the FDA for use in PDT to treat choroidal neovascularization in age‐related macular degeneration. Its use in this context is backed by decades of clinical experience that document its favorable safety profile under controlled light activation conditions. Beyond its approved photodynamic applications, preclinical studies have highlighted verteporfin’s effects in several fibrotic and proliferative disorders. In various in vitro and in vivo models—including studies on human tenon fibroblasts that induce fibrosis under conditions mimicking post‐glaucoma surgery, as well as investigations in trabecular meshwork and lamina cribrosa cells—verteporfin has been shown to inhibit YAP/TAZ signaling by preventing the nuclear localization and subsequent transcriptional activity of these mechanosensitive coactivators (Frömmichen et al., 2025; Murphy et al., 2022). Although no clinical trials to date have specifically evaluated verteporfin in the treatment of glaucoma, preclinical evidence from ocular fibrosis models and aqueous outflow studies in three‐dimensional setups has provided a mechanistic rationale for its use in this condition (ClinicalTrials.gov; Fung et al., 2024). Its use in fibrotic models of other organ systems, such as renal fibrosis where verteporfin promotes Smad protein degradation, further underscores its potential repurposing for ocular fibrotic conditions such as those seen in glaucoma (Szeto, 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, verteporfin functions by disrupting the transcriptional activity of YAP and TAZ. Under normal conditions—and particularly when mechanical cues such as extracellular matrix stiffness and TGF-β signaling are active—YAP and TAZ translocate to the nucleus where they bind to TEAD transcription factors and promote the expression of profibrotic and proliferative genes, including CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), fibronectin, and various collagen isoforms. Verteporfin interferes with this process by binding to YAP, thereby inhibiting the formation of the YAP–TEAD complex and preventing the subsequent transcription of target genes (Frömmichen et al., 2025; Sung et al., 2023). This inhibition is not limited to light-activated reactions; verteporfin exhibits these properties in the dark, making it a convenient candidate for off-label repurposing in diseases where light activation is neither required nor desirable. In addition, verteporfin’s action leads to a reduction in the expression of key profibrotic molecules, as evidenced in studies conducted in human tenon fibroblasts and trabecular meshwork cells. For example, reduced expression of α-SMA, fibronectin, and collagen has been documented in cellular models exposed to verteporfin, supporting its role in mitigating the fibrotic response (Frömmichen et al., 2025; Sung et al., 2023). At a signaling level, verteporfin’s inhibition of YAP/TAZ also disrupts the crosstalk with TGF-β-Smad pathways, as YAP/TAZ typically enhance Smad nuclear retention to drive the fibrotic transcriptional program. Consequently, verteporfin facilitates the proteasomal degradation of Smad proteins, further limiting fibrotic gene expression (Szeto, 2015; Wei & Li, 2020). Hence, by modulating both the YAP/TAZ and TGF-β-Smad axes, verteporfin directly targets the core pathogenic mechanism implicated in fibrosis within trabecular meshwork cells.

Expected Effect:
In the context of glaucoma, the proposed hypothesis is that verteporfin will inhibit YAP/TAZ nuclear activity in trabecular meshwork cells. Trabecular meshwork cells are critically involved in regulating aqueous humor outflow, and their function is compromised when fibrotic processes lead to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins and increased tissue stiffness. By disrupting the YAP–TEAD interaction, verteporfin is expected to attenuate the mechanoresponsive transcription of CTGF, fibronectin, and collagen. This reduction in fibrotic gene expression should, in turn, decrease matrix stiffness and improve the facility of aqueous humor outflow, thereby contributing to a reduction in intraocular pressure—a major risk factor for glaucoma progression (Sung et al., 2023; Fung et al., 2024). Experimental models utilizing three-dimensional aqueous outflow systems have shown that agents targeting fibrotic pathways can delay the increase in afferent line pressure, an analog for intraocular pressure, suggesting that verteporfin may have a similar beneficial effect in modulating trabecular meshwork physiology (Fung et al., 2024). Moreover, the expression of YAP and TAZ in trabecular meshwork cells has been well-documented, with their activation linked to the upregulation of profibrotic markers; therefore, the inhibition of these transcription factors by verteporfin is expected to restore more normal cellular architecture and function in the outflow pathway (Murphy et al., 2022; Sung et al., 2023). The overall effect anticipated is a reduction in trabecular meshwork fibrosis, leading to improved aqueous humor drainage, reduced outflow resistance, and ultimately lower intraocular pressure, which is the principal target of glaucoma therapy.

Overall Evaluation:
Verteporfin represents a promising candidate for repurposing as an anti-fibrotic agent in glaucoma, based on its robust mechanistic rationale and established clinical safety profile in ophthalmology. One of its primary strengths lies in its dual-action mechanism: while it has been used safely for PDT in retinal diseases, its ability to inhibit YAP/TAZ nuclear activity and disrupt the corresponding TEAD-mediated transcriptional program addresses a fundamental pathogenic process in glaucoma-related fibrosis. By reducing the expression of key profibrotic mediators such as CTGF, fibronectin, and collagen, verteporfin is expected to mitigate the fibrotic remodeling of the trabecular meshwork that compromises aqueous humor outflow. The mechanistic studies using human tenon fibroblasts and trabecular meshwork cell models provide compelling preclinical evidence supporting this hypothesis (Frömmichen et al., 2025; Sung et al., 2023).

Strengths of verteporfin include its well-documented pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, which facilitate faster clinical translation given its current FDA-approved status for ocular indications. Additionally, the preclinical evidence showing its efficacy in reducing fibrotic marker expression in relevant ocular cell types further underpins its potential utility in glaucoma. The molecular data, including its inhibitory effects on YAP/TAZ and subsequent downstream signaling, are robust and have been validated in various models of fibrosis, providing a strong foundation for its repurposing in glaucoma therapy (Sun et al., 2024; Szeto, 2015).

However, several weaknesses must be considered. First, although the in vitro studies and 3D model systems provide encouraging data, there remains a lack of direct clinical or in vivo evidence specifically in glaucoma patients. The translation from other fibrotic models (such as renal or dermal fibrosis) to trabecular meshwork fibrosis in glaucoma has not been fully established, and the nuances of ocular drug delivery in this context remain to be explored. Phototoxicity associated with verteporfin, while manageable in its conventional use with strict light controls, could pose challenges when repurposed for non-photoactivated anti-fibrotic therapy, particularly if dosing regimens differ from those traditionally used in PDT (Sung et al., 2023; Al-Moujahed et al., 2017). Furthermore, the optimal concentration and mode of administration (local versus systemic) to achieve effective YAP/TAZ inhibition in the trabecular meshwork without inducing off-target effects must be rigorously determined through preclinical studies. Finally, while verteporfin’s mechanism of action is well supported by mechanistic studies, the complexity of glaucoma pathogenesis—which includes not only fibrosis but also neurodegenerative components—suggests that verteporfin may be most effective as part of a combination therapy rather than as a stand-alone treatment.

In summary, verteporfin exhibits significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma through its ability to inhibit YAP/TAZ-mediated fibrotic pathways. Its existing clinical approval for ophthalmic uses, combined with compelling mechanistic data from multiple preclinical studies, supports its potential to reduce trabecular meshwork fibrosis, enhance aqueous humor outflow, and ultimately lower intraocular pressure—a critical objective in glaucoma management (Frömmichen et al., 2025; Fung et al., 2024; Murphy et al., 2022). While preclinical evidence is robust and the therapeutic rationale is sound, further targeted in vivo studies and early-phase clinical trials are necessary to clarify optimal dosing, delivery strategies, and long-term efficacy in glaucoma patients. Overall, the strengths of verteporfin, including its detailed molecular action and established safety profile, make it a compelling candidate for further development, with the primary weaknesses relating to the need for additional data in glaucoma-specific models and potential challenges related to drug delivery and phototoxicity management.
