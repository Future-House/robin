Proposal for Calcipotriol, a vitamin D analog.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Calcipotriol is a synthetic vitamin D3 analogue originally derived by chemically modifying 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (the active hormonal form of vitamin D3) to reduce its calcemic activity while retaining biologic efficacy toward the vitamin D receptor (VDR) (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022). This compound belongs to the class of vitamin D analogues that have been extensively used in dermatology for conditions such as psoriasis due to their ability to modulate cell proliferation and differentiation via nuclear receptor activation (Chan et al., 2022). Calcipotriol was discovered through a process of structure–activity relationship optimization aimed at retaining VDR binding specificity while reducing the bioactivity that leads to hypercalcemia, a common drawback with native calcitriol in systemic applications (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022). Its synthetic origin and chemical modifications also place calcipotriol in a category of drugs that have been repurposed in several experimental paradigms, demonstrating that the modulation of VDR signaling can have pleiotropic effects across various tissues (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, calcipotriol has been primarily used in the treatment of psoriasis and other hyperproliferative skin disorders because of its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, which are mediated through VDR activation (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022). Its excellent tolerability profile when applied topically in dermatological conditions is well established, and multiple repurposing studies have further confirmed its low systemic toxicity, making it an attractive candidate for potential ocular applications (Chan et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although there is currently limited direct clinical evidence for calcipotriol’s use in treating glaucoma, the literature contains several preclinical and observational studies that provide supportive mechanistic rationales for such repurposing. For instance, vitamin D and its active analogues have been evaluated in various animal models of ocular disease to determine their anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects, and certain studies have shown that VDR activation by vitamin D compounds can protect ocular tissues such as the trabecular meshwork (TM) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Caban & Lewandowska, 2022; Chan et al., 2022). In the context of fibrosis-related pathologies, particularly those affecting the TM that contribute to the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), calcipotriol’s potential mechanism of action is especially intriguing despite the absence of direct clinical trial data in glaucoma patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
The central premise of calcipotriol’s action is its binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a nuclear receptor that forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) upon activation, leading to modulation of gene transcription in target cells (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022). In the trabecular meshwork cells of the eye, VDR activation by calcipotriol is hypothesized to antagonize the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, notably inhibiting SMAD3-mediated transcriptional activities that promote extracellular matrix (ECM) protein overexpression and aberrant cell contractility (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; Caban & Lewandowska, 2022). Mechanistically, TGF-β, particularly TGF-β2, drives fibrotic remodeling in TM cells by inducing a cascade that involves phosphorylation of SMAD3, its nuclear translocation, and subsequent upregulation of pro-fibrotic markers such as fibronectin, collagen, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022). By activating VDR, calcipotriol is expected to interfere with these SMAD3-driven responses—possibly by competitive binding or by modulating the expression of inhibitory SMADs—thereby decreasing ECM deposition and reducing cellular stiffness within the TM (Caban & Lewandowska, 2022; Kutuzova et al., 2012). The molecular interactions involve the VDR-RXR complex binding to vitamin D response elements (VDREs) in the promoters of target genes, which can lead to downregulation of pro-fibrotic genes and upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that facilitate ECM turnover (Reins & McDermott, 2015; Morelli-Batters et al., 2022). Preclinical models have shown that modulation of these pathways can result in improved aqueous humor outflow dynamics as a consequence of decreased TM cell contractility and normalized ECM remodeling, ultimately lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) (Kutuzova et al., 2012; Chan et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
Based on the proposed mechanism, the expected therapeutic effect of calcipotriol in the glaucoma context is the alleviation of increased IOP through improvements in aqueous humor outflow. This is anticipated to be achieved by reducing the fibrotic remodeling of the trabecular meshwork via attenuation of the TGF-β/SMAD3 signaling axis, leading to diminished ECM protein expression and a decrease in cell contractility in TM cells (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; Kutuzova et al., 2012). In vitro studies have demonstrated that vitamin D analogues, including calcitriol (and by extension, its analogs such as calcipotriol), can counteract oxidative stress-induced damage and suppress the expression of pro-fibrotic markers in human TM cells (Caban & Lewandowska, 2022; Mrugacz et al., 2024). Additionally, in preclinical models, topical administration of vitamin D analogues has been associated with modest yet significant improvements in outflow facility, suggestive of enhanced aqueous humor drainage pathways; although these studies often focus on compounds like 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and related analogs, the underlying mechanism is proposed to be similar for calcipotriol (Kutuzova et al., 2012; Krefting et al., 2014). Furthermore, genetic studies linking VDR polymorphisms to glaucoma risk provide indirect support for the importance of VDR signaling in TM function and IOP regulation (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; Caban & Lewandowska, 2022). Thus, in an assay measuring TM cell contractility or ECM protein expression, exposure to calcipotriol is expected to result in the suppression of pro-fibrotic gene expression patterns and a reduction in the mechanical properties that impede aqueous humor outflow (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; Chan et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
The therapeutic candidate calcipotriol presents a compelling rationale for repurposing in glaucoma treatment based on its robust activation of the vitamin D receptor and its downstream modulation of fibrosis-related signaling pathways. One significant strength of calcipotriol is its well-established ocular safety profile derived from extensive dermatological use, which reduces the apprehension of potential toxicity in off-target tissues, including the eye (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, the mechanistic basis of its action—namely, the interference with SMAD3-mediated TGF-β transcriptional activity—has been validated in multiple models of fibrosis in non-ocular tissues, and there is emerging preclinical evidence showing that similar vitamin D analogues can rescue trabecular meshwork cell function (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; Kutuzova et al., 2012). The molecular pathway involving VDR activation has been well characterized, and the presence of VDR in trabecular meshwork cells supports the notion that calcipotriol could modulate intrinsic fibrotic processes in the eye (Caban & Lewandowska, 2022; Chan et al., 2022).

However, there are several caveats and potential weaknesses to consider. Despite the appealing mechanistic rationale, direct preclinical studies specifically assessing the efficacy of calcipotriol in glaucoma models—particularly those focusing on TM cell contractility, ECM remodeling, and intraocular pressure changes—are notably sparse in the current literature (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Caban & Lewandowska, 2022). Most evidence is inferential, based on studies with other vitamin D analogues or calcitriol itself, making it necessary to conduct targeted experiments to directly evaluate calcipotriol’s effects on the trabecular meshwork (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; Kutuzova et al., 2012). Additionally, while the safety profile in dermatology is favorable, the ocular pharmacokinetics and local tolerability of calcipotriol when administered topically to the eye require rigorous assessment because the ocular environment presents unique barriers to drug penetration and retention (Chan et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). There is also a need to better define the optimal dosing regimen and delivery methods to ensure that effective concentrations reach the trabecular meshwork without inducing off-target effects or local irritation. Furthermore, although VDR signaling modulates multiple fibrotic and inflammatory pathways, the complex interplay with SMAD-independent pathways (such as MAPK or Rho kinase signaling) may also influence trabecular meshwork physiology and could potentially limit the efficacy of a single-agent approach (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; Reins & McDermott, 2015).

Despite these challenges, the cumulative preclinical evidence supports further investigation of calcipotriol as a repurposed therapeutic for glaucoma, particularly as current glaucoma therapies primarily focus on lowering IOP without directly addressing the underlying ECM dysregulation and fibrotic changes in the trabecular meshwork (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; Kutuzova et al., 2012). Its mechanism based on nuclear receptor crosstalk, anti-fibrotic action, and potential neuroprotective properties (as suggested by related vitamin D analogues) provides a novel angle that could complement existing treatments and reduce the risk of disease progression by targeting the root causes of trabecular meshwork dysfunction (Caban & Lewandowska, 2022; Reins & McDermott, 2015). In summary, the strengths of calcipotriol include its established safety profile, well-characterized mechanism of VDR activation, and promising antifibrotic effects shown in related models. Its weaknesses lie in the current lack of direct preclinical and clinical data specifically evaluating its role in modulating trabecular meshwork function and aqueous humor dynamics in glaucoma. These considerations warrant further focused experimental studies and carefully designed clinical trials to establish the therapeutic potential of calcipotriol in glaucoma management (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kutuzova et al., 2012).

Overall, while the preclinical rationale and safety profile are supportive, additional in vitro, in vivo, and ultimately, clinical evidence is necessary to unequivocally validate calcipotriol as a repurposed drug candidate for glaucoma.
