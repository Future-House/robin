Proposal for Rapamycin (Sirolimus).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rapamycin, also known as sirolimus, is a naturally derived macrolide antibiotic originally isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Chemically, it belongs to the macrolide family and is characterized by its large lactone ring and high molecular weight, conferring it the ability to inhibit key cellular signaling pathways. It is synthesized through fermentation processes utilizing strains of Streptomyces and subsequently purified, and it has become paradigmatic as an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). As a representative of this class, rapamycin has been used extensively in the clinical management of organ transplant rejection due to its immunosuppressive properties, and it is also known for its anti-proliferative and anti-fibrotic activities in various cell types. Its extensive characterization in multiple systems has led to its repurposing in diverse therapeutic contexts in addition to its original indication (Unknown Reference, 2011).

Therapeutic History:
Rapamycin has a long therapeutic history across several fields. It is used extensively in transplant medicine as an immunosuppressant, where its main application is the prevention of organ rejection by inhibiting T-cell proliferation. Over the years, extensive preclinical work has demonstrated its anti-fibrotic properties, notably in models of pulmonary, renal, and cardiac fibrosis. In the ocular field, rapamycin has been evaluated in several preclinical and early clinical studies for applications in inflammatory conditions such as non-infectious uveitis and diabetic macular edema. Clinical trials such as those registered under NCT01517074 and NCT01675947 have investigated the safety and ocular pharmacokinetics of sirolimus administered via subconjunctival and intravitreal injections, respectively, primarily for ocular inflammatory diseases rather than glaucoma directly. Nevertheless, these studies provide a sound foundation regarding the drug’s local tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile, aspects that are highly relevant for its potential repurposing in glaucoma. Importantly, preclinical animal studies, including those involving rabbit glaucoma filtration surgery models, have shown that sustained-release formulations of sirolimus, such as the PLGA-based film, can prevent fibroblast proliferation and scar formation, with no significant ocular toxicity observed (Unknown Reference, 2011; Manzano et al., 2009). While rapamycin has not been directly indicated for glaucoma in published pivotal clinical trials, the extensive literature on its anti-fibrotic and immunomodulatory properties in ocular tissues underscores its potential utility in conditions characterized by extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and fibrosis, such as glaucomatous trabecular meshwork dysfunction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
Rapamycin exerts its pharmacological effects primarily through inhibition of the mTOR complex, specifically mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). At the molecular level, rapamycin forms a complex with the intracellular receptor FKBP-12, and this complex binds to mTORC1, inhibiting its kinase activity. Through mTORC1 inhibition, rapamycin blocks downstream phosphorylation events on key regulatory proteins such as p70S6 kinase and 4E-binding protein 1, which are essential for protein synthesis, cell growth, and proliferation. In the context of fibrosis, mTOR activation has been implicated in fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis. This is especially relevant for trabecular meshwork (TM) fibroblasts, where mTOR signaling cross-talks with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathways. TGF-β is a potent pro-fibrotic cytokine that drives fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation, upregulation of collagen synthesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling. By inhibiting mTORC1, rapamycin can disrupt this cross talk, thereby reducing TGF-β–mediated fibroblast proliferation and collagen production. This anti-fibrotic mechanism has been demonstrated in preclinical models in which rapamycin, delivered via sustained-release films or hydrogels, significantly reduced markers of fibroblast proliferation such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and increased apoptosis of fibroblasts in the surgical wound, potentially through cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase (Unknown Reference, 2011). Additionally, rapamycin-induced mTOR inhibition leads to enhanced autophagy, a cellular process beneficial in clearing damaged proteins and organelles, which is particularly protective for trabecular meshwork cells under stress, for example in glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma models (Zhu et al., 2020). Moreover, rapamycin’s regulation of mitochondrial quality control and its effects on the NF-kappa B signaling pathway further contribute to its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory profile, which is relevant in the context of glaucomatous neurodegeneration (Su et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
For the proposed hypothesis in glaucoma, the expectation is that rapamycin will inhibit mTORC1 in trabecular meshwork fibroblasts, thereby mitigating TGF-β–stimulated fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis. The anticipated downstream effect is an attenuation of extracellular matrix remodeling within the trabecular meshwork. Such remodeling—if left unchecked—can lead to increased outflow resistance, a critical factor in the development of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that when fibroblast proliferation is curtailed through mTOR inhibition, there is a corresponding reduction in markers such as collagen deposition and PCNA expression. This preservation of trabecular meshwork architecture is expected to improve aqueous humor outflow, potentially lowering IOP and slowing glaucomatous progression (Unknown Reference, 2011). Furthermore, in glaucoma animal models, rapamycin has been shown to induce autophagy in trabecular meshwork cells and protect these cells from glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby preserving cellular function and contributing to the maintenance of normal intraocular pressure (Zhu et al., 2020). The expected biochemical outcome is a decrease in TGF-β–induced extracellular matrix components such as collagen types and fibronectin in the trabecular meshwork, as well as a stabilization of cellular homeostasis through enhanced autophagic flux. These effects have been observed in vitro and in animal models and are promising indicators that rapamycin may be effective in improving outflow facility and preventing or delaying the onset of glaucomatous damage (Lee et al., 2019; Li et al., 2018).

Overall Evaluation:
In our comprehensive evaluation of rapamycin as a therapeutic candidate for glaucoma, several strengths and challenges emerge. Among the major strengths, rapamycin’s well-characterized mechanism of action through mTOR inhibition offers a clear molecular rationale for its anti-fibrotic effects in trabecular meshwork fibroblasts. The cross talk between mTOR and TGF-β signaling is a pivotal pathway in fibrosis, and preclinical models have repeatedly shown that rapamycin can reduce fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, two key drivers of extracellular matrix remodeling that contribute to increased outflow resistance and intraocular pressure elevation (Unknown Reference, 2011; Zhu et al., 2020). Moreover, rapamycin has an extensive therapeutic history, with established immunosuppressive, anti-proliferative, and anti-fibrotic properties across multiple organ systems. Its previous use in ocular indications such as non-infectious uveitis and diabetic macular edema provides valuable preliminary evidence regarding its topical ocular safety and pharmacokinetic profile, which strongly supports its repurposing for glaucoma (Nguyen et al., 2013; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, innovative drug delivery systems, such as the sustained-release PLGA films and injectable hydrogels that have been tested in rabbit models of glaucoma filtration surgery, have shown promising results in maintaining therapeutic drug levels in ocular tissues, indicating that the formulation challenges associated with rapamycin’s poor aqueous solubility can be overcome (Unknown Reference, 2011; Sun et al., 2025).

Despite these promising attributes, several challenges remain. First, while preclinical animal studies and early-phase clinical trials in other ophthalmic diseases have demonstrated favorable outcomes regarding safety and anti-fibrotic effects, there is currently a lack of direct clinical trial data for rapamycin’s efficacy in treating glaucoma specifically. The majority of existing clinical studies have focused on inflammatory and neovascular conditions rather than directly addressing trabecular meshwork remodeling or intraocular pressure reduction. Secondly, the pharmacokinetic challenges inherent in delivering rapamycin effectively to the trabecular meshwork must be considered. Although advanced drug delivery systems have been developed, the translational gap between preclinical models and human efficacy remains a critical step. Finally, while the anti-fibrotic and immunosuppressive actions of rapamycin are well-documented, long-term safety data in the context of ocular use, particularly with chronic administration for a condition like glaucoma that requires prolonged treatment, still need to be established.

In conclusion, the cumulative evidence supports the therapeutic potential of rapamycin for glaucoma through its inhibition of mTORC1, interference with TGF-β–mediated fibroblast proliferation, and consequent reduction in pathological extracellular matrix remodeling in the trabecular meshwork. The strong mechanistic rationale, bolstered by robust preclinical findings and a favorable safety profile in related ocular studies, points to rapamycin as a promising candidate for repurposing in glaucoma treatment (Unknown Reference, 2011; Zhu et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Li et al., 2018). Nevertheless, further research including focused clinical trials specifically addressing glaucoma endpoints, detailed ocular pharmacokinetics, and long-term safety assessments is required before definitive conclusions can be reached regarding its clinical efficacy in this context. Thus, while challenges exist, rapamycin’s well-characterized biochemical actions and its demonstrable anti-fibrotic effects provide a compelling case for its continued evaluation as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma.
