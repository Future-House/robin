Proposal for Y-27632 (Sigma-Aldrich cat. Y0503).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Y-27632 is a synthetic small molecule that was originally developed as a selective inhibitor of Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCKs), specifically ROCK1 and ROCK2. Synthesized and commercially available from suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich (cat. Y0503), this compound belongs to a well‐established class of ROCK inhibitors that have garnered significant attention for their ability to modulate cell contractility by interfering with the Rho/ROCK signaling cascade. ROCK inhibitors, including Y-27632, were initially identified during biochemical screening efforts designed to elucidate agents that could alter actomyosin contractility through modulation of intracellular signaling pathways. As such, these inhibitors have been widely exploited as pharmacological tools in cell biology to study cytoskeletal dynamics, cell adhesion, and motility. Their application extends from in vitro collagen gel contraction assays to investigations in vascular smooth muscle cells, wherein the inhibition of ROCK activity leads to a reduction in contraction and a consequent relaxation of tissues. Importantly, the discovery of Y-27632 has laid foundational groundwork for understanding the molecular mechanisms governing cellular stiffness and contractility, particularly in tissues such as the trabecular meshwork (TM) of the eye, where abnormal contraction is implicated in elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma pathology (Hirata et al., 2008; Kaneko et al., 2016).

ROCK inhibitors have been used broadly in both preclinical research and, more recently, in clinical settings across cardiovascular, neurological, and ophthalmological applications. The class of compounds has proven instrumental in dissecting cellular processes that rely on actomyosin interactions and in developing therapeutic strategies based on tissue relaxation. Their prior uses in models of vasospasm, wound healing, and ocular tissue remodeling highlight their versatility. In glaucoma research, the TM is a critical site for aqueous humor outflow, and its dysfunction—manifested by increased stiffness and abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition—is a central contributor to disease progression. The ability of Y-27632 to improve TM cell function by reducing contractile tone and modulating ECM composition positions it as a promising candidate for repurposing in glaucoma treatment (Hirata et al., 2008; Kaneko et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Y-27632 has a robust preclinical therapeutic history that spans several fields. In cardiovascular research, ROCK inhibitors have been employed to induce vasodilation through the inhibition of smooth muscle contraction, thereby reducing blood pressure and mitigating vascular dysfunction. In ophthalmology, Y-27632 has been extensively studied in animal models and ex vivo systems to evaluate its impact on the TM, which is the primary resistance site for aqueous humor outflow. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated that Y-27632 reduces contractility in TM cells, leading to a softening of the meshwork and an increase in outflow facility. For instance, ex vivo experiments utilizing human organ-cultured anterior segments (HOCAS) have shown that treatment with Y-27632 results in a dose-dependent enhancement in aqueous humor drainage, a finding directly relevant to the treatment of glaucoma (Liu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2013).

Furthermore, Y-27632 has been deployed in models of retinal ischemia where its neuroprotective potential has been examined. Intravitreal administration in animal studies has demonstrated that Y-27632 attenuates retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death following transient retinal ischemia, suggesting that beyond its IOP-lowering effects, the compound may also confer direct neuroprotection. Such studies have established that ROCK inhibition can reduce inflammatory cell recruitment and improve vascular integrity, thereby protecting the neural retina from ischemic insult (Hirata et al., 2008).

In addition, Y-27632 has been utilized in models of wound healing and fibrosis. Studies in corneal epithelial cells and fibroblasts have shown that Y-27632 can promote cell proliferation and enhance wound closure without inducing apoptosis (Okumura et al., 2015). Despite its extensive use in these preclinical paradigms, searches in clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) indicate that Y-27632 itself has not been formally advanced into clinical trials for glaucoma. Nonetheless, its mechanistic and pharmacological profile as established in preclinical studies has paved the way for the development and clinical approval of newer ROCK inhibitors such as netarsudil and ripasudil, which have demonstrated IOP-lowering efficacy in human subjects (Ashwinbalaji et al., 2018; Kaneko et al., 2016).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Y-27632 exerts its pharmacological effects by competitively inhibiting the ATP-binding site of ROCK1 and ROCK2. Under normal physiological conditions, the Rho/ROCK pathway is activated when RhoA is in its GTP-bound state. Activated ROCK phosphorylates multiple downstream substrates, most notably the myosin light chain (MLC), which plays a crucial role in actomyosin-based contraction. The phosphorylation of MLC increases its interaction with myosin, thereby enhancing contractile force. In the trabecular meshwork, this leads to cellular contraction, increased stiffness, and a reduction in the permeability of the outflow pathway, ultimately contributing to an elevation in IOP (Wang et al., 2013).

Y-27632 binds to ROCK and prevents it from phosphorylating MLC and other substrates such as the myosin binding subunit (MYPT1) of myosin light chain phosphatase. This inhibition results in a decrease in MLC phosphorylation, which in turn reduces actomyosin contractility. The ensuing relaxation of TM cells leads to a "softening" of the extracellular matrix and an increase in aqueous humor outflow facility (Kaneko et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2013). Additionally, treatment with Y-27632 results in noticeable morphological changes in TM cells, including cell retraction and rounding, accompanied by a reduction in the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes (Kaneko et al., 2016).

Beyond these anti-contractile effects, Y-27632 has significant anti-fibrotic actions. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) is known to exacerbate TM stiffness by promoting the upregulation of ECM proteins, including fibronectin, collagen type I, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Y-27632 interferes with the TGF-β signaling cascade, thereby reducing the expression of these fibrotic markers. This action helps maintain TM homeostasis and confers a protective effect against the progressive ECM remodeling that contributes to outflow resistance in glaucoma (Liu et al., 2024; Montecchi-Palmer et al., 2017).

Furthermore, ROCK inhibition by Y-27632 appears to enhance the phagocytic activity of TM cells. An increase in phagocytosis is critical for clearing cellular debris in the outflow pathway, thereby preserving the permeability of the TM and preventing the buildup of occlusive material that could further elevate IOP (Wang et al., 2023). There is also evidence indicating that by reducing MLC phosphorylation, Y-27632 may promote a neuroprotective environment in the retina, potentially by improving ocular blood flow and reducing ischemic stress on retinal ganglion cells (Hirata et al., 2008).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the repurposing of Y-27632 for glaucoma treatment is that its inhibition of ROCK1/2 will lead to a significant reduction in trabecular meshwork cell contractility. Laboratory assays, such as collagen gel contraction experiments, consistently show that Y-27632 markedly decreases TM cell-mediated collagen gel contraction, indicative of its ability to reduce cell contractile forces (Ashwinbalaji et al., 2018). This anti-contractile effect is presumed to “soften” the trabecular meshwork, thereby enhancing aqueous humor outflow through the conventional drainage pathway and ultimately lowering intraocular pressure (Wang et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2023).

In vitro studies have demonstrated that when TM cells are treated with Y-27632, there is a pronounced reduction in the phosphorylation of MLC, leading to relaxation of actin stress fibers and decreased formation of focal adhesions. This cellular relaxation is accompanied by a decrease in the expression of ECM components that contribute to TM stiffness. Ex vivo studies using human anterior segment perfusion models have further validated these findings by showing that ROCK inhibitors, including Y-27632, increase outflow facility in a dose-dependent manner (Ashwinbalaji et al., 2018). Consequently, the expected net effect in the glaucomatous eye would be a lowering of IOP—a critical therapeutic goal in managing glaucoma.

Beyond its impact on the outflow pathway, Y-27632 is also anticipated to provide neuroprotective benefits. Preclinical data suggest that ROCK inhibitors can improve local ocular blood flow and reduce retinal ganglion cell apoptosis following ischemic insults, which is particularly relevant given that glaucomatous damage involves not only elevated IOP but also optic nerve degeneration (Hirata et al., 2008).

In summary, the expected effects of Y-27632 in glaucoma treatment are multifold:
1. A reduction in TM cell contractility through decreased MLC phosphorylation, resulting in a “softer” and more compliant outflow pathway.
2. A decrease in ECM deposition and fibrotic marker expression within the TM, counteracting TGF-β-driven pathological remodeling.
3. An enhancement in the phagocytic capacity of TM cells, promoting the clearance of debris and maintenance of outflow facility.
4. Secondary neuroprotective effects via improved ocular blood flow and reduction of ischemia-induced retinal ganglion cell death (Ashwinbalaji et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
The comprehensive preclinical evidence positions Y-27632 as a very promising candidate for repurposing in glaucoma therapy. One of the major strengths of this compound is its well-characterized mechanism of action—by selectively inhibiting ROCK1/2, Y-27632 effectively reduces the phosphorylation of MLC, thereby decreasing actomyosin contractility in TM cells. This mechanism not only leads to a direct reduction in TM stiffness but also facilitates better aqueous humor outflow, which is essential for lowering intraocular pressure, the primary modifiable risk factor in glaucoma (Wang et al., 2013; Kaneko et al., 2016).

Furthermore, Y-27632 has consistently demonstrated favorable tolerability in ocular tissues as evidenced by in vitro and ex vivo studies. Its lack of cytotoxicity and capacity to promote beneficial cellular changes—such as reduced fibrosis and enhanced phagocytosis—underscore its potential for safe long-term ocular use. In addition, the dual benefits afforded by Y-27632, namely, the direct mechanical effects on TM cells and the neuroprotective effects on retinal ganglion cells via improved ocular perfusion, offer a holistic therapeutic approach to glaucoma management. This multifaceted activity is particularly advantageous given that glaucoma is a multifactorial disease involving both mechanical and neurodegenerative components (Hirata et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2013).

Nevertheless, several potential weaknesses must be acknowledged. Despite compelling preclinical data, Y-27632 has not yet been evaluated in clinical trials for glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This lack of human data poses challenges in predicting its clinical efficacy, optimal dosing, and long-term safety profile in patients. Moreover, comparative studies have indicated that while Y-27632 is effective in reducing TM cell contractility, newer ROCK inhibitors such as netarsudil and ripasudil—both of which have advanced through clinical development—may exhibit higher potency or more favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. This relative potency issue may require the development of advanced drug delivery systems (for example, sustained-release formulations or targeted ocular delivery via nanotechnology) to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the target tissues without systemic exposure (Kaneko et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2023).

Another concern is the potential for off-target effects given the ubiquity of the ROCK pathway in various tissues. Although Y-27632 appears to be well tolerated in ocular preclinical models, systemic absorption and inadvertent inhibition of ROCK in other organ systems may lead to unintended consequences (Wang et al., 2023). For instance, vascular tissues are also sensitive to ROCK inhibition, and care must be taken to ensure that therapeutic administration remains confined to the ocular compartment.

Additionally, the complex pathophysiology of glaucoma—which not only involves elevated IOP but also neuroinflammatory and vascular components—requires that any therapeutic intervention address multiple aspects of the disease process. While Y-27632’s dual action on TM relaxation and neuroprotection is promising, comprehensive clinical evaluation will be essential to determine whether these effects translate into meaningful clinical benefits when compared with existing therapies.

Despite these concerns, Y-27632 serves as an excellent proof-of-concept molecule that has significantly advanced our understanding of the Rho/ROCK pathway’s role in ocular physiology and pathology. Its extensive use as a research tool has provided critical insights that have, in turn, informed the development of more advanced ROCK inhibitors now in clinical use. The breadth of preclinical evidence—from in vitro collagen gel contraction assays showing reduced TM contractility (Ashwinbalaji et al., 2018) to ex vivo studies demonstrating enhanced aqueous humor outflow (Ashwinbalaji et al., 2018) and in vivo models indicating potential neuroprotective benefits (Hirata et al., 2008)—collectively support the therapeutic potential of Y-27632 in glaucoma.

In conclusion, Y-27632 is a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in glaucoma management. Its mechanism of inhibiting ROCK1/2 leads to decreased phosphorylation of myosin light chain, thereby reducing TM cell contractility and softening the outflow pathway. This action is expected to increase aqueous humor drainage and produce a clinically significant reduction in IOP. In addition, its potential to protect retinal ganglion cells through improved ocular perfusion offers an added advantage in combating glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Although the current evidence is overwhelmingly preclinical, and Y-27632 itself has yet to enter clinical trials for glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), its well-documented pharmacological profile, favorable safety characteristics in ocular tissues, and robust mechanistic rationale provide a compelling argument for further development. Future research must focus on designing early-phase clinical trials to establish optimal dosing regimens and to compare its efficacy with that of newer ROCK inhibitors, as well as on developing innovative drug delivery systems to maximize its therapeutic index while minimizing systemic exposure (Liu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2013).

Overall, based on the extensive preclinical biochemical, cellular, and functional evidence available from a variety of studies, Y-27632 offers significant promise as a repurposed agent for glaucoma. It capitalizes on the central role of ROCK in regulating TM cell contractility and ECM remodeling—a key pathological mechanism in glaucomatous IOP elevation—and provides the additional potential benefit of neuroprotection. These findings warrant comprehensive clinical evaluation of Y-27632, with a focus on optimally delivering the drug to the TM and achieving sustained IOP reduction without systemic side effects (Ashwinbalaji et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Wang et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2023).
