Proposal for Atorvastatin.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Atorvastatin is a synthetic member of the statin class of drugs originally derived from fungal metabolites and later modified into potent HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitors. As a cholesterol‐lowering agent, it was developed by chemical optimization to enhance potency and tissue penetration, and it is characterized by its greater lipophilicity compared with some other statins. Statins, as a class, have been conventionally used for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases through their ability to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis; however, over the past two decades mounting evidence has highlighted a series of pleiotropic effects that extend beyond lipid lowering. These include anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions, as well as the inhibition of protein prenylation processes that affect small GTPases such as RhoA. The repurposing hypothesis for atorvastatin in glaucoma is based on these latter biochemical properties, which have the potential to modify trabecular meshwork (TM) cell function by decreasing RhoA prenylation and subsequent Rho‐associated protein kinase (ROCK) activity, thereby mitigating excessive contractility and fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation that hinder aqueous humor outflow (Cai et al., 2015; Liao et al., 2007).

Therapeutic History:
Atorvastatin has an extensive clinical history as a frontline therapeutic agent for hypercholesterolemia and related cardiovascular conditions. Its efficacy in lowering low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular events has been demonstrated in numerous high‐quality clinical trials, and its favorable safety profile has established it as a staple in cardiovascular risk management (Nohria et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2015). Biochemically, atorvastatin’s ability to inhibit the mevalonate pathway not only reduces cholesterol levels but also decreases the synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates necessary for the post‐translational prenylation of small GTPases, a mechanism responsible for its pleiotropic properties. Although atorvastatin has not been formally evaluated in registered clinical trials specifically targeting glaucoma management (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), observational studies and meta‐analyses have reported epidemiological signals suggesting that statin use may be associated with a reduced risk of primary open‐angle glaucoma (Talwar et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2022). Preclinical studies derived from similar statin compounds—such as simvastatin and lovastatin, which share mechanistic similarities with atorvastatin—have demonstrated the capacity to modulate trabecular meshwork cell function, including attenuation of fibrotic ECM production and modulation of cell contractility. This collective body of literature supports exploring atorvastatin as a repurposed candidate for glaucoma through its modulation of RhoA prenylation and ROCK signaling pathways (Kim et al., 2017; Rupérez et al., 2007).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, atorvastatin exerts its primary pharmacological action by competitively inhibiting HMG‐CoA reductase, the rate‐limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. This inhibition results in the decreased production of mevalonate and its downstream isoprenoid intermediates, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and, critically, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate is required for the post‐translational prenylation of small GTPases including RhoA. Prenylation is essential for RhoA to attach to cell membranes where it becomes fully active. When atorvastatin reduces the availability of GGPP, RhoA remains unprenylated, resulting in impaired membrane localization and diminished activation (Rikitake & Liao, 2005; Liao, 2010).

RhoA, when activated, stimulates its downstream effector ROCK (Rho‐associated protein kinase), which plays a central role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, cellular contractility, and extracellular matrix production. In vascular and ocular tissues, ROCK‐mediated phosphorylation of substrates such as myosin light chain (MLC) and myosin‐binding subunit (MBS) leads to increased actomyosin contractility and promotes the synthesis and deposition of fibrotic ECM proteins that can increase tissue stiffness. In the trabecular meshwork, these processes are critical because increased cellular contractility and ECM accumulation contribute to higher outflow resistance, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), and ultimately glaucoma progression (Nohria et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2015).

Moreover, statins have been shown to affect transforming growth factor‐beta (TGF‐β) signaling pathways. TGF‐β, particularly TGF‐β2, has been implicated in the pathological remodeling of the optic nerve head and trabecular meshwork, and studies have indicated that statin treatment can inhibit TGF‐β2‐mediated Smad2/3 activation and subsequent ECM production in ocular cells (Kim et al., 2017). This dual action on both cytoskeletal contractility via RhoA/ROCK and on ECM modulation via TGF‐β signaling provides a strong biochemical rationale for the potential use of atorvastatin in glaucoma.

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the hypothesis is that atorvastatin will reduce RhoA prenylation in trabecular meshwork cells, resulting in decreased ROCK activity. This reduction in ROCK-driven contractility is expected to manifest as a relaxation of TM cells. By reducing cellular contractility, there should be a concomitant decrease in the production and deposition of fibrotic extracellular matrix components, which in turn would decrease the rigidity of the TM and improve aqueous humor outflow. The net effect of these changes would be a lowering of intraocular pressure, which is a primary therapeutic target in glaucoma management (Wang et al., 2024; Cai et al., 2015).

In more detail, the TM is known to express key components of the RhoA/ROCK signaling cascade, and multiple studies have demonstrated that inhibition of ROCK can lead to increased outflow facility and IOP reduction. In vitro studies using other statins such as simvastatin and lovastatin have shown modulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics and extracellular matrix remodeling in TM cells (Villarreal et al., 2014). Given that atorvastatin is more lipophilic than some other statins, it may possess superior capacity for ocular tissue penetration, potentially enhancing its local effects in the TM. Additionally, the overall favorable safety record of atorvastatin further supports the hypothesis that repurposing it for glaucoma could be achieved with minimal adverse risk, at least in the context of a well‐controlled therapeutic window (Talwar et al., 2017; Liao et al., 2007).

The expected outcomes in in vitro assays would include measurable decreases in markers of RhoA activity (such as reduced membrane association of RhoA) and decreased phosphorylation levels of ROCK substrates such as MLC and MBS in trabecular meshwork cells. Functionally, these molecular changes should correlate with decreased cell stiffness and a reduction in ECM protein expression—key determinants of aqueous outflow resistance (Rupérez et al., 2007; Nohria et al., 2009). In animal models of glaucoma, one would anticipate observing a reduction in IOP following topical or systemically administered atorvastatin, although such studies remain to be specifically performed. Nonetheless, the preclinical biochemical rationale strongly supports this treatment paradigm.

Overall Evaluation:
Atorvastatin emerges as a promising drug candidate for repurposing in glaucoma based on several lines of evidence from the biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature. Its well‐established history as a cholesterol‐lowering agent with a robust safety profile, coupled with its documented pleiotropic effects on RhoA prenylation and the downstream ROCK pathway, provides a solid mechanistic basis for its potential application in glaucoma therapy. The strengths of atorvastatin as a repurposed candidate include its high lipophilicity, which may enhance ocular tissue penetration and enable effective modulation of TM cell function, its broad and well‐characterized clinical use history in cardiovascular diseases implying extensive safety data, and compelling preclinical data supporting the hypothesis that inhibition of RhoA prenylation can relax TM cells and reduce ECM deposition (Cai et al., 2015; Nohria et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2024). Furthermore, epidemiological studies hinting at a correlation between statin use and a reduced risk of open‐angle glaucoma add additional support for pursuing this repurposing strategy (Talwar et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2022).

However, several challenges and potential weaknesses must be addressed. First, despite encouraging biochemical and observational evidence, there remains a lack of formal clinical trial data evaluating atorvastatin specifically for glaucoma treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), meaning that its efficacy in reducing IOP via TM modulation in humans has not been directly proven. Second, the precise dosing regimen and route of administration required to achieve adequate drug levels in the trabecular meshwork without eliciting systemic adverse effects will need careful optimization. Although systemic atorvastatin therapy is widely tolerated, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters in ocular tissues are less well understood, and high local concentrations might be necessary to inhibit RhoA prenylation effectively in the TM (Liao et al., 2007; Rupérez et al., 2007). Third, while the inhibition of RhoA prenylation is a promising mechanism, the TM is a complex tissue with multiple interacting signaling pathways, and compensatory mechanisms may mitigate the expected benefits. It will therefore be crucial to explore combination strategies or optimized formulations (e.g., topical delivery systems) that maximize local drug exposure while minimizing off-target effects. Additionally, the heterogeneity within glaucoma patients, in terms of TM pathology and genetic predisposition, may influence the responsiveness to a repurposed atorvastatin treatment regimen (Kim, 2017; Wang et al., 2024).

In summary, the converging evidence from molecular studies demonstrates that atorvastatin’s inhibition of HMG‐CoA reductase disrupts the prenylation of RhoA, leading to diminished ROCK activity, reduced cellular contractility, and a decrease in the production of fibrotic ECM components in trabecular meshwork cells. These effects are precisely aligned with the pathological features of glaucoma, where increased TM stiffness and aberrant ECM deposition contribute to impaired aqueous humor outflow and elevated intraocular pressure. Although clinical research directly addressing the application of atorvastatin for glaucoma is currently sparse, the mechanistic rationale combined with supportive epidemiological observations renders it a highly promising candidate for further preclinical and clinical investigation. The strengths of atorvastatin include its established safety profile, potential for enhanced ocular penetration due to its lipophilicity, and a well‐defined mechanism that addresses key pathogenic processes in the TM. Conversely, the weaknesses and challenges lie in the absence of targeted clinical data, the need for precise dosing and delivery optimization, and the possibility that complex TM biology may require multi‐targeted therapeutic approaches. On balance, the repurposing of atorvastatin for glaucoma merits serious consideration and warrants the initiation of mechanistic in vitro studies in human TM cells, followed by in vivo animal model testing and eventually pilot clinical trials to rigorously assess its efficacy in lowering intraocular pressure and altering disease progression (Nohria et al., 2009; Talwar et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2022).
