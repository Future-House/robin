Proposal for Candesartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Candesartan is a synthetic small‐molecule angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) that was initially discovered and developed for systemic treatment of hypertension. It belongs to the class of ARBs, which function by selectively antagonizing the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), thereby preventing angiotensin II from eliciting its vasoconstrictive, pro-fibrotic, and pro-inflammatory effects. Candesartan is chemically derived from earlier prototype ARBs and has been optimized for high binding affinity and prolonged receptor interaction, making it a potent and long-acting agent. Historically, ARBs have been synthesized by chemical modification of peptide structures related to angiotensin II, leading to non-peptide antagonists that offer improved oral bioavailability and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Candesartan is among the most established drugs in this class, with extensive use in cardiovascular medicine, and recent studies have highlighted its potential to affect local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity in the eye (Al-khfajy, Jwaid, & Al-Mashhadani, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a).

Therapeutic History:
Candesartan has been used worldwide for decades as an antihypertensive agent based on its efficacy in lowering blood pressure and reducing cardiovascular events. As an ARB, it has also been shown to be effective in managing heart failure and providing renal protective effects. The safety profile of candesartan in systemic applications is well established through numerous clinical trials and widespread clinical use. Beyond its cardiovascular indications, preclinical studies have revealed that ARBs, including candesartan, can penetrate ocular tissues following systemic administration and exhibit activity in modulating local ocular RAS components (Al-khfajy, Jwaid, & Al-Mashhadani, 2018). Although the majority of clinical studies for ARBs have focused on systemic diseases, several preclinical investigations have demonstrated that ARBs can lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in animal models through mechanisms that include modulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in the trabecular meshwork and sclera (Soler, 2022). However, a search of ClinicalTrials.gov reveals that there are no registered clinical trials specifically investigating candesartan for glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b), which suggests that, while repurposing for glaucoma has been proposed in recent literature, clinical evidence remains limited. Nevertheless, similar compounds within the ARB class, such as losartan and telmisartan, have provided proof-of-concept data in various glaucoma models (Hazlewood et al., 2018; Quigley et al., 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
Candesartan exerts its pharmacological effects by binding selectively to AT1R, a receptor that mediates many of the adverse effects of angiotensin II, including vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis, and cellular proliferation. At the molecular level, binding of angiotensin II to AT1R stimulates intracellular second messenger cascades such as the phospholipase C/IP3/DAG pathway, leading to increased intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinases that ultimately promote transcription of fibrotic and pro-inflammatory genes. Importantly, in the context of the eye, engagement of AT1R has been linked to activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways. TGF-β is a key cytokine that drives fibrosis by inducing collagen synthesis and promoting extracellular matrix deposition in ocular tissues including the trabecular meshwork, sclera, and retina (Choudhary et al., 2017). By antagonizing AT1R, candesartan is expected to inhibit angiotensin II-induced TGF-β activation, thereby reducing the synthesis of ECM proteins like collagen type I and decreasing cytoskeletal contractility. This mechanism is further supported by preclinical studies demonstrating that ARBs downregulate TGF-β signaling—reflected by diminished phosphorylation of Smad proteins—and reduce fibrotic marker expression (Hazlewood et al., 2018; Choudhary et al., 2017). In addition to these antifibrotic effects, ARBs may also provide neuroprotective benefits by mitigating oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades that contribute to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, as shown in models of normal tension glaucoma (Semba et al., 2014). Thus, the molecular interaction of candesartan with AT1R potentially interferes with multiple pathological processes: it reduces ECM remodeling in the trabecular outflow pathway and diminishes pro-inflammatory and fibrotic signaling in retinal tissues.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underpinning the repurposing of candesartan for glaucoma is that its AT1R blockade in trabecular meshwork cells will inhibit angiotensin II-induced TGF-β activation. In the proposed assay, this is expected to result in decreased expression of fibrotic markers such as collagen type I and α-smooth muscle actin, as well as a reduction in cytoskeletal contractility. These changes should, in turn, improve aqueous humor outflow facility, thus lowering IOP—a crucial risk factor in glaucoma progression. Preclinical data support the notion that ARBs can reduce markers of ocular fibrosis and maladaptive extracellular matrix remodeling in ocular tissues (Hazlewood et al., 2018; Choudhary et al., 2017). Moreover, studies employing animal models of glaucoma have demonstrated that ARBs not only lower IOP but also confer neuroprotection to retinal ganglion cells by reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting inflammatory mediators (Semba et al., 2014; Oh et al., 2023). Given that AT1R is known to be expressed in trabecular meshwork cells, as well as in other ocular cell types involved in regulating outflow and structural integrity of the optic nerve head, the expected biochemical response to candesartan in the proposed assay is strongly supported by the literature (Choudhary et al., 2017; Al-khfajy, Jwaid, & Al-Mashhadani, 2018). The cumulative effect would be a reduction in ECM deposition and cytoskeletal contraction in the trabecular meshwork, leading to improved aqueous humor drainage and a consequent reduction in intraocular pressure, thereby addressing glaucoma pathophysiology from both a biomechanical and neuroprotective standpoint.

Overall Evaluation:
The review of the literature indicates that candesartan is a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma due to its well-characterized pharmacology, established safety profile in cardiovascular disorders, and multiple preclinical studies supporting its role in modulating detrimental ocular processes. One of the primary strengths of candesartan is its high affinity for AT1R and its capacity to penetrate ocular tissues, as demonstrated by pharmacokinetic studies in animal models (Soler, 2022; Al-khfajy, Jwaid, & Al-Mashhadani, 2018). Its mechanism of action, which involves the inhibition of angiotensin II-induced TGF-β signaling, directly addresses key pathological mechanisms in glaucoma—namely, the fibrosis and extracellular matrix remodeling that contribute to decreased outflow facility in the trabecular meshwork (Choudhary et al., 2017; Hazlewood et al., 2018). Additionally, neuroprotective effects observed in experimental models, including preservation of retinal ganglion cells and attenuation of inflammatory responses, further enhance its therapeutic potential (Semba et al., 2014).

Despite these promising attributes, several weaknesses need consideration. The clinical evidence for using candesartan specifically in glaucoma remains sparse, as highlighted by the lack of registered clinical trials directly testing candesartan for this indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b). This limitation suggests a gap between preclinical proof-of-concept data and the translation of these findings into clinical practice. Moreover, while animal studies have demonstrated effective ocular penetration and IOP-lowering effects with topical formulations of ARBs, it is not yet clear whether similar formulations of candesartan would achieve comparable efficacy and safety in humans (Soler, 2022). Another potential weakness is the multifactorial nature of glaucoma, where elevated IOP is one of several contributing factors. The neuroprotective and antifibrotic actions of candesartan are compelling; however, there may be patient subpopulations (for example, those with normal-tension glaucoma) in whom these mechanisms have limited impact on disease progression (Semba et al., 2014). In addition, while the inhibition of TGF-β signaling is beneficial in reducing fibrosis, TGF-β also has roles in normal tissue homeostasis and wound healing, meaning that long-term inhibition could potentially lead to unintended consequences in ocular tissues.

Overall, candesartan holds considerable promise as a repurposed candidate for glaucoma therapy based on its specific mechanism of blocking AT1R, its established role in modulating TGF-β-driven fibrotic pathways, and its potential neuroprotective effects in the optic nerve head and retina. Its favorable safety profile in systemic use and demonstrated efficacy in preclinical ocular studies make it a strong candidate for further investigation. However, there remains a significant need for targeted clinical studies to assess optimal dosing, formulation (e.g., topical delivery systems that ensure adequate intraocular bioavailability), and long-term safety, as well as to clarify its effects on trabecular meshwork cells and aqueous humor dynamics in the context of glaucoma. In summary, the strengths of candesartan include its high receptor affinity, extensive preclinical data supporting antifibrotic and neuroprotective roles, and established clinical safety in hypertension, whereas its weaknesses center on the current lack of direct clinical trial data for glaucoma and the challenges of translating systemic pharmacology to effective ocular therapy (Al-khfajy, Jwaid, & Al-Mashhadani, 2018; Choudhary et al., 2017; Soler, 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b). Further research and well-designed clinical trials will be essential to determine whether candesartan can fulfill its promising preclinical potential as a novel therapeutic for glaucoma.
