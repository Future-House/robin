Proposal for Fresolimumab (GC-1008), a pan–TGF-β neutralizing monoclonal antibody.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fresolimumab (GC‐1008) is a humanized monoclonal antibody specifically engineered to neutralize all isoforms of transforming growth factor‐beta (TGF‐β1, TGF‐β2, and TGF‐β3), and it belongs to the class of biologic agents that target cytokine signaling pathways. Originally discovered and developed in the context of oncology and fibrotic diseases, fresolimumab was generated through recombinant DNA technology and humanization techniques to achieve high binding affinity (with KD values approximately 1.3–2.8 nM) to TGF‐β isoforms, thereby preventing interactions with their cognate receptors (Akhurst, 2017). As a monoclonal antibody, it is classified under the immunoglobulin G subclass, which inherently possesses high specificity and targeted biological activity. These characteristics allow the molecule to selectively sequester TGF‐β ligands in the extracellular environment. The antibody was synthesized for systemic use initially and has demonstrated safety and pharmacodynamic activity in clinical settings for fibrotic and oncological conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011). The novelty of fresolimumab lies in its isoform‐agnostic inhibition; by neutralizing all active TGF‐β isoforms, it avoids the pitfalls seen with more selective agents that might fail to account for compensatory upregulation of non‐targeted isoforms (Ogata et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Fresolimumab’s therapeutic history is rooted in its prior evaluation in several systemic fibrotic pathologies and oncology indications. It has been tested in phase I and II clinical trials for conditions such as metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006, 2007, 2010). These studies have established that systemic administration of fresolimumab is generally safe and that it exerts the expected biological activity by reducing fibrotic markers and modulating TGF‐β–driven signaling cascades (Akhurst & Hata, 2012; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011). Although these trials have primarily focused on non‐ocular diseases, the role of TGF‐β in tissue fibrosis is a common denominator in a range of pathologies. Importantly, in the context of glaucoma, elevated TGF‐β, especially TGF‐β2, has been implicated in the aberrant deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the trabecular meshwork (TM) and optic nerve head, leading to increased outflow resistance and elevated intraocular pressure (Daher, 2015; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012). Prior clinical exploration of TGF‐β2–targeted approaches in ocular settings, such as the use of selective antibodies (e.g., CAT-152), have met with mixed results, likely due to the redundancy among TGF‐β isoforms. Fresolimumab, by virtue of its pan-TGF-β neutralization, offers an advantage in this regard by addressing potential compensatory pathways mediated by TGF-β3 alongside TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 (Karkampouna & Kruithof-de Julio, 2014; Khaw et al., 2020). Although there is no direct record of fresolimumab’s use in glaucoma to date, the extensive literature on TGF-β’s role in ocular fibrosis and ECM remodeling in glaucoma provides a strong theoretical basis to repurpose this agent for ocular indications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
Fresolimumab functions by binding to all active isoforms of TGF-β with high affinity, thereby sequestering these ligands and preventing them from engaging their receptor complexes on the cell surface. The TGF-β receptor complex, typically formed by TGF-β receptor type I (TGF-βRI) and type II (TGF-βRII), upon ligand binding, initiates intracellular signaling cascades primarily via phosphorylation of receptor-regulated SMAD proteins (SMAD2 and SMAD3), which then complex with the common mediator SMAD4. This complex translocates into the nucleus to modulate the transcription of pro-fibrotic genes, including those that drive the production of extracellular matrix proteins (such as collagen, fibronectin, and elastin) as well as those that induce connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Saika, 2006). In the trabecular meshwork, excessive activation of the TGF-β/SMAD pathway results in a fibrotic phenotype characterized by increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and tissue stiffness, thereby increasing aqueous outflow resistance and in turn elevating intraocular pressure (IOP) (Prendes et al., 2013; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012). By neutralizing TGF-β, fresolimumab is expected to interrupt this cascade of SMAD-dependent transcriptional activation, reduce ECM deposition, and inhibit the myofibroblast transition of TM cells (Akhurst, 2017). Biochemically, fresolimumab’s binding to TGF-β prevents it from interacting with its receptors on target cells such as the trabecular meshwork, thereby mitigating the downstream signaling events that normally trigger fibrotic responses (Ogata et al., 2024). This broad-spectrum inhibition is particularly important in the ocular environment where multiple isoforms may be simultaneously active, and selective inhibition might not be sufficient due to potential upregulation of alternate isoforms (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis driving the repurposing of fresolimumab for glaucoma postulates that subconjunctival or topical administration will allow the antibody to reach the anterior chamber of the eye, where it can bind elevated levels of TGF-β isoforms. In glaucomatous eyes, TGF-β—most notably TGF-β2—is known to be overexpressed in the trabecular meshwork, leading to enhanced activation of the SMAD signaling pathway and subsequent pathological matrix deposition (Daher, 2015; Tovar-Vidales et al., 2011). By sequestering these cytokines, fresolimumab would prevent receptor engagement on trabecular meshwork cells and block downstream pro-fibrotic signaling. The expected molecular outcome is a reduction in SMAD-driven transcription of candidate genes that code for ECM proteins as well as enzymes such as tissue transglutaminase (TGM2), which are implicated in ECM crosslinking and tissue stiffness (Tovar-Vidales et al., 2011; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012). Consequently, this should restore a more normal balance of ECM synthesis and degradation, reduce TM fibrosis, improve aqueous humor outflow, and ultimately result in a lowering of intraocular pressure. Supporting this mode of action, animal studies have shown that inhibition of TGF-β signaling can lead to decreased outflow resistance and lower IOP, and related anti-TGF-β strategies (albeit with isoform-specific antibodies) have demonstrated some benefits in decreasing postoperative scarring following glaucoma surgery (Yamanaka et al., 2015; Prendes et al., 2013). Importantly, the use of a pan-TGF-β neutralizing antibody such as fresolimumab may overcome the limitations observed with selective inhibitors that fail to address the contributions of multiple isoforms, thereby providing a more robust therapeutic effect in a multifactorial disease process like glaucoma (Akhurst & Hata, 2012; Ogata et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Fresolimumab presents as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of glaucoma. Its molecular design as a pan-TGF-β neutralizing antibody offers several distinct advantages. First, by targeting all isoforms of TGF-β, fresolimumab addresses the compensatory mechanisms that can often undermine selective inhibition strategies; this is critical in glaucoma, where elevated TGF-β2 is a central driver of ECM deposition in the trabecular meshwork but TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 may also contribute to disease progression (Akhurst, 2017; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012). Second, the specificity afforded by the antibody modality ensures a targeted blockade of TGF-β signaling with minimal off-target effects, a particularly desirable property for potential local (subconjunctival or topical) administration, where systemic exposure and adverse effects can be minimized (Ogata et al., 2024; Prendes et al., 2013). Additionally, the extensive clinical and preclinical data demonstrating the antifibrotic effects of TGF-β neutralization in other organ systems underpin its potential effectiveness in mitigating the ECM-related pathology observed in glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012).

However, several challenges remain. The translation of systemic dosing regimens and safety profiles observed in oncology and fibrotic diseases to an ocular setting is not straightforward. While animal studies have indicated that TGF-β blockade can ameliorate fibrosis and improve outflow resistance, there is a paucity of direct evidence from ocular administration studies with fresolimumab. Local pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration, and sustained activity within the anterior chamber after subconjunctival or topical delivery will need to be meticulously evaluated (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ogata et al., 2024). Moreover, while high specificity is a strength, complete inhibition of TGF-β signaling could potentially impair physiological wound healing and immune regulation, which are essential in the delicate ocular environment, particularly following surgical interventions (Yamanaka et al., 2015). The balance between antifibrotic efficacy and the preservation of TGF-β’s homeostatic functions will be a key consideration in dose selection and administration route development.

Another consideration is the potential for local immunogenicity or unforeseen adverse effects unique to the ocular surface. While fresolimumab has demonstrated favorable safety profiles in systemic trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2012; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016), the ocular immune milieu differs from systemic circulation, and local delivery might uncover unique safety challenges. Furthermore, it is critical to establish that the antibody can achieve sufficient intraocular concentrations to neutralize TGF-β isoforms effectively without compromising other physiological processes, such as epithelial integrity or tear film stability (Akhurst & Hata, 2012).

Despite these challenges, the strengths of fresolimumab—its robust mechanism of action, broad-spectrum neutralization, and the strong preclinical rationale supporting TGF-β’s role in glaucomatous ECM deposition—make it a compelling candidate for further investigation. Its potential to reduce SMAD-driven fibrotic signaling in the trabecular meshwork could lead to meaningful decreases in outflow resistance and IOP, which are central therapeutic targets in glaucoma (Prendes et al., 2013; Tovar-Vidales et al., 2011). Given the unmet need in the current glaucoma therapeutic landscape, particularly with respect to disease-modifying treatments that target the underlying fibrotic processes, fresolimumab represents a scientifically sound and strategically promising option for repurposing (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Ogata et al., 2024).

In summary, fresolimumab’s well-documented ability to neutralize all TGF-β isoforms, its favorable safety and pharmacodynamic profiles observed in systemic fibrotic and oncological trials, and the strong mechanistic rationale linking TGF-β activity to glaucomatous changes in the trabecular meshwork collectively support the hypothesis that local (subconjunctival or topical) administration could decrease SMAD-dependent ECM deposition, alleviate outflow resistance, and ultimately lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. Although direct ocular evidence is presently limited, the extensive supportive data from preclinical models and clinical studies in other fibrotic conditions justify further focused studies to explore the ocular pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of fresolimumab in glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012). With careful optimization of delivery strategies and dosing paradigms, fresolimumab holds promise as a novel therapeutic approach for modifying the disease course of glaucoma by targeting the underlying fibrotic mechanisms.
