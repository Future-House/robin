Proposal for Simvastatin.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Simvastatin is a member of the statin class of compounds, which are primarily HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Originally derived from natural fermentation products produced by fungi such as Aspergillus terreus, simvastatin was later semi-synthetically modified to improve its potency and pharmacokinetic properties (Kim, 2017). As a lipophilic statin, simvastatin readily crosses cell membranes and has been extensively used for lowering circulating cholesterol levels and reducing cardiovascular risk. Its synthesis involves chemical derivatization of its natural precursor, resulting in a prodrug that is converted in vivo to its active β-hydroxy acid form, which competitively binds the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. Statins as a class have been pivotal in reducing the risk of coronary artery disease through their cholesterol-lowering and pleiotropic effects that include anti-inflammatory and endothelial-protective properties (Wu et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Simvastatin has a long clinical history in the management of hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease. Widely prescribed over several decades, it has established an extensive safety record in systemic use. Despite its primary indication as a lipid-lowering agent, statins have been investigated over the years for their pleiotropic effects, which include anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and antifibrotic actions. Epidemiological and observational studies have noted an association between statin use and a lower risk or slower progression of glaucoma, indicating potential benefits beyond cardiovascular protection (Leung et al., 2010; McGwin et al., 2004). In particular, simvastatin has been questioned as a possible repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma management due to its ability to modulate pathways implicated in the trabecular meshwork function and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling (Talwar et al., 2017). However, a direct clinical trial evaluating simvastatin for glaucoma is still lacking, as underscored by the absence of records on ClinicalTrials.gov for “Simvastatin AND glaucoma” (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Mechanism of Action:
Simvastatin’s primary mechanism of action is the competitive inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. This inhibition leads to a reduction in the synthesis of cholesterol and also suppresses the production of isoprenoid intermediates such as farnesylpyrophosphate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. The depletion of these isoprenoids is significant beyond cholesterol lowering because these intermediates are required for the post-translational prenylation of small GTP-binding proteins, notably RhoA (Von Zee et al., 2009). Prenylation is essential for the proper localization and activation of RhoA on the plasma membrane where it triggers downstream signaling cascades including the activation of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK). ROCK activation is a crucial mediator of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, stress fiber formation, and cellular contractility. In trabecular meshwork (TM) cells, overactivation of the Rho/ROCK pathway contributes to increased cellular stiffness and aberrant extracellular matrix deposition, both of which reduce aqueous humor outflow and lead to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) – the major risk factor for glaucoma (Yoo et al., 2023; Kim, 2017).

Additionally, simvastatin’s ability to inhibit RhoA prenylation confers an antifibrotic effect by reducing the notion that non-prenylated, cytosolic Rho proteins cannot effectively engage their downstream targets. The result is a decrease in ROCK-mediated phosphorylation of myosin light chain, which in turn reduces actomyosin contractility and stress fiber formation in TM cells (Yoo et al., 2023). This molecular activity positions simvastatin to potentially restore a more relaxed, less fibrotic state in the trabecular meshwork, thereby increasing aqueous humor outflow and reducing IOP (Wu et al., 2020). These combined biochemical actions underpin the hypothesis that simvastatin could modulate key pathogenic mechanisms in glaucoma, such as exaggerated ECM synthesis and trabecular meshwork contractility.

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay, simvastatin is expected to demonstrate a reduction in trabecular meshwork cell contractility, a decrease in stress fiber formation, and a concomitant reduction in ECM deposition. The hypothesis posits that by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, simvastatin will reduce the prenylation and subsequent activation of RhoA. This effect should lead to a decline in ROCK pathway activation; in turn, there will be decreased phosphorylation of myosin light chain and a reduction in the formation of actin stress fibers (Yoo et al., 2023). As a consequence, TM cells are likely to exhibit a less contractile, more compliant phenotype, which is conducive to improved aqueous humor outflow and, thereby, a reduction in IOP (Kim, 2017). Additionally, the antifibrotic effects expected from simvastatin may include a reduction in the synthesis and deposition of ECM proteins such as fibronectin—proteins that contribute to the increased outflow resistance observed in glaucomatous eyes (Yoo et al., 2023). Moreover, given that genes encoding components of the Rho/ROCK pathway and associated ECM proteins are expressed in trabecular meshwork cells, simvastatin’s mechanism is directly relevant to the pathology observed in these cells (Von Zee et al., 2009). The overall expected effect in an in vitro assay would therefore be measurable as a decreased cellular contractility, reduced ECM protein expression, and potentially enhanced permeability of the trabecular meshwork, all of which are anticipated to facilitate better aqueous humor drainage (Talwar et al., 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
Simvastatin emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of glaucoma based on a convergence of biochemical rationale, epidemiological associations, and established systemic safety. One of the primary strengths of simvastatin is its well-documented mechanism of inhibiting the mevalonate pathway, which is not only central to cholesterol synthesis but also critically involved in the post-translational modification of small GTPases such as RhoA. By reducing prenylation, simvastatin indirectly attenuates the Rho/ROCK pathway, a key regulator of trabecular meshwork cell contractility and ECM remodeling—both of which are pathological in glaucoma (Yoo et al., 2023; Von Zee et al., 2009). This mechanistic specificity supports the hypothesis that simvastatin can enhance aqueous outflow and reduce intraocular pressure by alleviating the fibrotic and contractile state of the trabecular meshwork.

Epidemiologically, several large-scale observational studies and systematic reviews have noted that statin use is associated with a modest reduction in the risk of developing glaucomatous conditions, as well as with slower disease progression, particularly in normal tension glaucoma cases (Leung et al., 2010; McGwin et al., 2004; Talwar et al., 2017). Although these studies do not provide direct causal evidence—and they are often limited by confounding variables—the consistency of the association across populations enhances the plausibility of a protective role for simvastatin in glaucoma. Furthermore, simvastatin’s extensive safety profile in millions of patients worldwide provides additional reassurance regarding its systemic tolerability, although the translation of systemic safety to ocular-specific applications will require further targeted investigations (McGwin et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2020).

However, there are some notable weaknesses and challenges. First, despite promising mechanistic data and epidemiological associations, there is a lack of direct clinical trial evidence specifically testing simvastatin in the context of glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov). This gap poses a significant hurdle, as the translation from observational findings and preclinical in vitro data to actual clinical efficacy in reducing intraocular pressure and halting glaucoma progression remains uncertain. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic properties of simvastatin when administered systemically may not ensure sufficient ocular penetration or adequate concentration at the trabecular meshwork, which might necessitate alternative delivery strategies (Unknown Reference).

Another consideration is the multifactorial nature of glaucoma itself. While the hypothesis is focused on the antifibrotic and Rho/ROCK inhibitory effects of simvastatin, glaucoma is a complex disease involving vascular dysregulation, neurodegeneration, and genetic predispositions that might not be fully addressed by targeting a single pathway. Therefore, simvastatin might be more effective as an adjunct therapy rather than as a monotherapy. Its beneficial effects on ocular blood flow and potential neuroprotective properties—as suggested by some studies—could complement existing intraocular pressure-lowering treatments (Leung et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2020).

In summary, simvastatin offers several attractive features for repurposing in glaucoma therapy. Its molecular action on the HMG-CoA reductase pathway—and the downstream inhibition of RhoA prenylation and ROCK activation—directly targets pathological changes in the trabecular meshwork that contribute to elevated intraocular pressure. Epidemiological studies provide supportive, albeit indirect, evidence of statins’ protective effects on glaucoma incidence and progression. Additionally, the long-standing clinical use of simvastatin in cardiovascular disease, with its robust safety profile, adds to its appeal as a low-cost, widely available therapeutic candidate. On the other hand, the absence of dedicated clinical trials evaluating simvastatin in glaucoma patients, along with potential issues regarding ocular drug delivery and the multifactorial etiology of glaucoma, are important weaknesses that must be addressed in future research (Fakhri et al., 2024; Talwar et al., 2017; McCann et al., 2016). Overall, while further preclinical experiments and well-designed clinical trials are warranted to confirm efficacy, optimize dosing, and develop appropriate delivery methods, simvastatin shows significant promise as a repurposed drug candidate for glaucoma. Its ability to modulate key cellular pathways implicated in trabecular meshwork dysfunction, combined with supportive epidemiological data and an excellent safety record, makes it an attractive candidate for future drug development initiatives (Leung et al., 2010; Yoo et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2020).
