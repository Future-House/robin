Proposal for Fasudil (HA-1077), a rho kinase inhibitor.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fasudil (also known as HA-1077) is a small‐molecule inhibitor of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) that was initially discovered as a vasodilator agent for use in cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. It belongs to the isoquinoline sulfonamide class of compounds, and its molecular structure comprises an isoquinoline core linked to a sulfonamide moiety. Fasudil was synthesized through a series of organic reactions aimed at introducing the sulfonyl group onto the isoquinoline nucleus, a modification that confers its inhibitory activity on the ATP-binding site of ROCK enzymes. This compound, along with others in its class, has traditionally been employed for cardiovascular applications, primarily via its ability to relax vascular smooth muscle through inhibition of ROCK-dependent signaling pathways. Its history of use in vascular and neurological settings is supported by extensive pharmacological research and a well-established safety profile in these indications, thereby making Fasudil an attractive candidate for repurposing in ocular diseases such as glaucoma (Chang & Wang, 2014; Cholkar et al., 2015).

Therapeutic History:
Fasudil has a long-standing therapeutic history in treating cardiovascular conditions in Japan and China, particularly for cerebral vasospasm, where it is approved and used clinically to ensure improved cerebral blood flow following ischemic events. Its mechanism of inducing smooth muscle relaxation through the inhibition of ROCK has been well characterized in this context, lending credence to its potential benefits in other tissues characterized by contractile properties. Notably, preclinical investigations have demonstrated that the biochemical actions of Fasudil translate into effective modulation of cell contractility in various tissues, including ocular tissues such as the trabecular meshwork. Although clinical trials specifically addressing Fasudil in glaucoma or ocular hypertension are lacking—as indicated by searches on ClinicalTrials.gov—the extensive preclinical data and biochemical rationale suggest that Fasudil’s utility may extend into ophthalmology by leveraging its well-documented ROCK inhibitor activity (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chang & Wang, 2014). In animal models, other ROCK inhibitors have been successfully used to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) by enhancing aqueous humor outflow, and Fasudil has been shown in similar in vitro settings to attenuate trabecular meshwork (TM) cell contraction in collagen gel assays, providing an encouraging basis for its further evaluation as a glaucoma therapeutic agent (Chang & Wang, 2014; Cholkar et al., 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
Fasudil exerts its pharmacological effect primarily by competitively inhibiting the activity of Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCK1 and ROCK2), which are serine/threonine kinases pivotal in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. At the molecular level, ROCKs regulate cellular contractility through the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) as well as through inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase. Fasudil binds to the ATP-binding pocket of the ROCK enzyme, thereby inhibiting the kinase’s ability to phosphorylate MLC. This blockade results in a reduction in actomyosin contraction within cells, leading to relaxation of tissues that rely on actin-myosin interactions for contractile properties. In the context of the trabecular meshwork of the eye, ROCK expression is confirmed, and its activity is directly linked to the resistance against aqueous humor outflow. By inhibiting ROCK, Fasudil is expected to diminish stress fiber formation and extracellular matrix (ECM) contractility in TM cells, which, in turn, facilitates the expansion of intercellular spaces and improves aqueous outflow, ultimately contributing to a reduction in intraocular pressure (Chang & Wang, 2014; Chatzimichail et al., 2025).
Besides its effect on the contractile apparatus, Fasudil may also modulate the assembly of focal adhesions and influence cell shape and motility through its impact on the actin cytoskeleton. This modulation is essential in maintaining the biomechanical properties of the trabecular meshwork, as increased rigidity in the tissue plays a major role in glaucomatous pathology. The biochemical interactions of Fasudil involve the disruption of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway, which has been implicated in the pathological stiffening of the TM and subsequent failure of conventional aqueous humor drainage (Chang & Wang, 2014; Chatzimichail et al., 2025). Additionally, ROCK inhibitors have been shown to exert beneficial neurovascular and neuroprotective effects in animal models, which further enhances the rationale for their use in diseases such as glaucoma where optic nerve health is of paramount importance (Chang & Wang, 2014; Ismaiel et al., 2017).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, the expected therapeutic effect of Fasudil in glaucoma is to lower intraocular pressure by enhancing the outflow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork. The compound is anticipated to block ROCK-dependent myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation in TM cells, a process that normally promotes stress fiber formation and contributes to cellular contractility and ECM rigidity. By attenuating these processes, Fasudil should effectively reduce the mechanical resistance to aqueous humor outflow, resulting in improved drainage and thus a decrease in IOP. In vitro studies have shown that Fasudil can induce relaxation of TM cells, and similar effects have been observed with other ROCK inhibitors that increase the conventional outflow facility in animal models (Chang & Wang, 2014; Wang et al., 2023).
Moreover, the ROCK pathway plays a role not only in cellular contractility but also in fibrotic processes, including postoperative scarring seen after glaucoma filtration surgery. By inhibiting ROCK activity, Fasudil may also exert antifibrotic effects which would be beneficial in improving surgical outcomes by mitigating scar formation and preserving the functionality of surgical blebs (Chang & Wang, 2014; Chatzimichail et al., 2025). This multifaceted mechanism is particularly valuable in addressing both the intraocular pressure component and the neuroprotective needs of glaucoma management. Given that the trabecular meshwork expresses significant levels of ROCK isoforms, Fasudil’s direct action on these cells is expected to result in a robust enhancement of aqueous outflow and a measurable drop in IOP, which has been a predictive outcome in various preclinical studies employing topical or systemic ROCK inhibitors (Chang & Wang, 2014; Ismaiel et al., 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
Fasudil emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for glaucoma based on its well-documented pharmacological profile and its established safety record in non-ocular indications such as cerebral vasospasm and cardiovascular disorders. One of the primary strengths of Fasudil is its clear mechanism of action; by inhibiting ROCK, it directly impacts the cytoskeletal dynamics of trabecular meshwork cells, leading to reduced cellular contractility and enhanced aqueous humor outflow. This effect addresses the fundamental pathophysiological mechanism underlying elevated intraocular pressure in glaucoma (Chang & Wang, 2014; Cholkar et al., 2015). The compound’s chemical structure and mode of inhibition have been extensively studied, and its interaction with the ATP-binding site of ROCK is well characterized, which supports a robust biochemical rationale for its repurposing in glaucoma treatment (Chang & Wang, 2014; Cholkar et al., 2015).
Furthermore, Fasudil’s relatively favorable systemic pharmacokinetic profile and its demonstrated tolerability in cardiovascular applications add to its appeal as a repurposed drug candidate. Although there is no current registered clinical trial for Fasudil in glaucoma patients—highlighted by recent queries on ClinicalTrials.gov—the preclinical and biochemical data from other ROCK inhibitors such as ripasudil and netarsudil provide substantial indirect evidence for the potential efficacy of Fasudil in an ocular context (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chang & Wang, 2014).
The expected benefits of Fasudil in glaucoma include not only an IOP-lowering effect through its action on trabecular meshwork cells but also the potential for neuroprotection and improved ocular blood flow, which are critical for preventing or slowing optic nerve damage. This dual action, targeting both the mechanical and the neurodegenerative components of glaucoma, represents a significant advantage over traditional therapies that focus solely on reducing aqueous humor production or enhancing uveoscleral outflow (Chang & Wang, 2014; Wang et al., 2023).
However, several challenges remain. Despite its established use in other pathologies, Fasudil has not yet been rigorously evaluated in large-scale clinical trials for glaucoma, and its ocular pharmacokinetics, particularly with respect to achieving effective concentrations in the trabecular meshwork after topical administration, require further investigation. Additionally, while the adverse effects observed with other ROCK inhibitors are generally mild and transient (for example, conjunctival hyperemia), the safety and tolerability profile of Fasudil in the ocular setting must be established through comprehensive clinical studies (Chang & Wang, 2014; Chatzimichail et al., 2025). There is also a need to optimize delivery methods—such as sustained-release formulations via PLGA microspheres or advanced liposomal carriers—to ensure adequate bioavailability and minimize off-target systemic exposure (Wang et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2020).
In summary, Fasudil represents a strong candidate for repurposing in glaucoma due to its well-defined mechanism of action, preclinical evidence supporting improved aqueous humor outflow, and a safety profile established in other therapeutic areas. Its ability to decrease ROCK-mediated MLC phosphorylation in trabecular meshwork cells addresses a key pathogenic mechanism in glaucoma, and its additional potential for neuroprotective effects reinforces its suitability as a multifaceted therapeutic agent. Nevertheless, further detailed pharmacokinetic studies and clinical trials are imperative to validate its efficacy, establish optimal dosing regimens, and fully characterize its safety in the ocular environment. These additional studies would determine whether the promising preclinical data can be successfully translated into a viable treatment option for patients with glaucoma (Chang & Wang, 2014; Chatzimichail et al., 2025; Ismaiel et al., 2017).

Overall, the strengths of Fasudil include its potent ROCK inhibitory activity with a clear mechanism that directly targets the trabecular meshwork’s contractile apparatus, an established clinical safety record in systemic applications, and promising preclinical evidence suggesting that ROCK inhibition can effectively lower intraocular pressure. The weaknesses center on the currently limited direct clinical evidence for its use in glaucoma, potential challenges in ocular drug delivery that need to be addressed through formulation innovations, and the need for rigorous evaluation of its ocular safety profile. Despite these challenges, the body of biochemical and preclinical literature provides a strong rationale for the continued investigation of Fasudil as a repurposing candidate for glaucoma treatment. Further research in this area could position Fasudil not only as an alternative treatment option for patients with ocular hypertension but also as part of a multifaceted therapeutic strategy aimed at both lowering IOP and protecting the optic nerve in glaucoma (Chang & Wang, 2014; Chatzimichail et al., 2025; Ismaiel et al., 2017).
