Assay Overview:
The proposed assay involves treating trabecular meshwork (TM) cells—ideally primary human TM cells—with dexamethasone to induce overexpression and secretion of myocilin. Myocilin, a protein implicated in glaucoma pathogenesis, is quantified in the cell culture supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This measurement serves as a biochemical readout of steroid-induced TM cell stress and dysfunction, modeling a key aspect of glaucoma pathogenesis: impaired aqueous humor outflow due to extracellular protein accumulation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. In this in vitro system, the levels of secreted myocilin provide a surrogate marker to evaluate the activity of candidate compounds designed to prevent or reverse these pathological changes (ahadome2017smallmoleculeinhibitionof pages 3-4).

Biomedical Evidence:
Myocilin has been robustly linked to the pathogenesis of glaucoma. In TM cells, treatment with glucocorticoids like dexamethasone significantly upregulates myocilin mRNA and protein levels, leading to increased accumulation of the protein in and around TM cells. This biochemical change correlates with disrupted aqueous humor outflow and heightened intraocular pressure (IOP), which are central to both steroid-induced glaucoma and primary open-angle glaucoma (nasir2020effectofdexamethasone pages 1-2, he…2014effectsoftransforming pages 1-2). Proteomic studies further support that steroid exposure alters the expression of key ECM components and associated proteins in TM cells, confirming the role of myocilin in glaucoma-related TM dysfunction (bollinger2012proteomicsimilaritiesin pages 1-2, li2023dexamethasoneinducessenescenceassociated pages 2-3). Clinically, elevated myocilin levels are observed in glaucomatous eyes, and mutations in the myocilin gene are causative in some familial glaucoma cases. This establishes myocilin production as not only a reliable marker of cellular stress in TM cells but also a direct contributor to disease pathology (pfeffer2010reducedmyocilinexpression pages 1-2).

Previous Use:
The strategy of dexamethasone-induced myocilin upregulation has been extensively used to mimic glucocorticoid-induced ocular hypertension in vitro. Early studies in both human and non-human primate TM cells have shown that dexamethasone consistently induces myocilin secretion, and that ELISA-based quantification of myocilin is a sensitive method to detect these changes (pfeffer2010reducedmyocilinexpression pages 8-9, ahadome2017smallmoleculeinhibitionof pages 3-4). This approach has facilitated the identification and validation of novel therapeutic agents that can mitigate myocilin accumulation, with some work extending to patient-derived TM cells to capture clinical variability (NCT02151318). Although not every study directly employed a dedicated ELISA, the consistent use of biochemical assays to monitor myocilin underscores its significance as a readout in glaucoma drug discovery (mount2022thedosedependent pages 12-16).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of this assay include its direct relevance to a well-established pathological mechanism in glaucoma, namely, the glucocorticoid-induced increase in myocilin secretion. The ELISA format offers quantitative, reproducible, and high-throughput capabilities, which are essential for early-stage drug screening (kumar2021stemcellfreetherapy pages 1-5, li2023dexamethasoneinducessenescenceassociated pages 2-3). Furthermore, using primary TM cells enhances disease relevancy by capturing the native cellular context and response variability observed in clinical samples (ahadome2017smallmoleculeinhibitionof pages 3-4).

However, the assay is not without limitations. Glaucoma is a multifactorial disease involving a constellation of cellular and biomechanical changes beyond myocilin upregulation, such as cytoskeletal remodeling and ECM deposition, which are not fully captured by a single protein biomarker (pfeffer2010reducedmyocilinexpression pages 2-2). Additionally, variability in primary cell cultures and the inherent limitations of in vitro modeling pose challenges regarding the translation of findings to in vivo efficacy (bollinger2012proteomicsimilaritiesin pages 1-2). Thus, while the myocilin secretion ELISA is a potent initial screening tool, it is best employed alongside complementary assays that assess other dimensions of TM cell pathology.

Overall, the assay is scientifically valid and useful for early-stage glaucoma therapeutic screening, provided its results are interpreted within the broader context of TM pathology and corroborated with additional in vitro and in vivo models (nasir2020effectofdexamethasone pages 1-2, pfeffer2010reducedmyocilinexpression pages 8-9).
