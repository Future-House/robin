Assay Overview:
The proposed assay involves stably transfecting trabecular meshwork (TM) cells with a TOPFlash luciferase reporter construct to quantitatively measure canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity. TM cells, whether primary human TM (pHTM) or established lines (e.g., GTM3 or iHTM), are chosen because they are directly implicated in regulating aqueous humor outflow and intraocular pressure (IOP), which are central to glaucoma pathogenesis (ahadome2017smallmoleculeinhibitionof pages 10-11). The assay measures luciferase activity as an indirect readout of β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcriptional activation; thus, candidate drugs can be evaluated based on their capacity to either restore or inhibit Wnt signaling balance, which subsequently affects extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover and cell adhesion in the TM (liu2023longnon‐codingrna pages 6-9).

Biomedical Evidence:
Dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is increasingly recognized as a central driver in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. In the TM, abnormal Wnt signaling correlates with altered ECM dynamics, which directly impacts aqueous humor outflow and IOP regulation. Elevated expression of Wnt antagonists, such as secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1) and DKK1, has been noted in glaucomatous TM cells, leading to reduced nuclear β-catenin and compromised Wnt transcriptional activity (vallee2021cannabidiolandthe pages 5-6). Additionally, the interplay between Wnt signaling and profibrotic TGFβ signaling forms a critical axis: TGFβ-induced ECM deposition and cross-linked actin network (CLAN) formation are well-documented in the glaucomatous TM, and the reinstatement of Wnt/β-catenin activity has been shown to counterbalance these deleterious effects (webber2016crosstalkbetweentgfβ pages 1-2). Thus, assessing the ability of therapeutics to modulate Wnt signaling using the TOPFlash reporter assay directly addresses a pathophysiologically relevant mechanism in glaucoma, aligning the assay with both biomedical and clinical insights.

Previous Use:
The utilization of TOPFlash or TCF/LEF-based luciferase reporters in TM cells has been consistently demonstrated in several studies. For instance, investigations into steroid-induced glaucoma have leveraged such reporter systems to evaluate the effects of small molecules on dexamethasone-induced TM phenotypes, linking Wnt signaling modulation to both ECM changes and alterations in myocilin expression (ahadome2017smallmoleculeinhibitionof pages 10-11). Other studies have applied dual-luciferase reporter assays to assess how long non-coding RNAs and GSK3β inhibitors affect Wnt signaling activity in both normal and glaucomatous TM cells (liu2023longnon‐codingrna pages 6-9, sugali2024gsk3βinhibitorsinhibit pages 1-2). These investigations confirm that TOPFlash reporter assays are sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in canonical Wnt pathway activity and have successfully been used in early-stage drug discovery to screen for compounds capable of restoring TM function.

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of this assay include its specificity and quantitativeness. The TOPFlash reporter provides a sensitive measurement of β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity, a direct readout of a central signaling pathway implicated in ECM turnover and TM physiology (webber2016crosstalkbetweentgfβ pages 1-2). The assay’s established application in both primary and transformed TM cells ensures biological relevance. Moreover, the model has demonstrated utility in dissecting the antagonistic crosstalk between Wnt and TGFβ signaling, offering insights that are directly translatable to glaucoma pathology (sugali2024gsk3βinhibitorsinhibit pages 2-3).

However, challenges include the inherent variability of primary TM cell cultures, which may introduce heterogeneity into the assay outcomes. Additionally, while in vitro measures of Wnt signaling provide key mechanistic insights, these data need to be integrated with in vivo outcomes due to the complexity of ocular physiology. Finally, the absence of strong associations in databases like Open Targets regarding CTNNB1 underscores the need for further validation across complementary experimental models (OpenTargets Search: glaucoma-CTNNB1).

In summary, the TOPFlash-based Wnt/β-catenin reporter assay in TM cells is a scientifically sound and relevant platform for early drug discovery in glaucoma, with robust support from both biomedical and clinical literature (ahadome2017smallmoleculeinhibitionof pages 10-11, liu2023longnon‐codingrna pages 6-9, webber2016crosstalkbetweentgfβ pages 1-2).
