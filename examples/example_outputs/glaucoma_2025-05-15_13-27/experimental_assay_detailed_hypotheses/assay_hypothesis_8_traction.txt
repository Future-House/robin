Assay Overview:
This assay employs traction force microscopy (TFM) by seeding trabecular meshwork (TM) cells onto fluorescent bead‐embedded polyacrylamide hydrogels whose elastic moduli are tuned (e.g., 1.5 and 21.7 kPa) to replicate the in vivo stiffness of normal and glaucomatous TM tissue (karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 1-3, karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 3-4). The key measurement is the cell‐generated traction force, which is computed by tracking the displacement of embedded fluorescent beads using high‐resolution confocal imaging over time. Importantly, the assay can be integrated into a three-dimensional (3D) culture model that incorporates active fluid-structure interactions (FSI) to simulate the dynamic conditions of the aqueous humor outflow pathway. Both normal and glaucomatous TM cells are examined, providing a direct biomechanical readout of contractility that is central to TM function and intraocular pressure (IOP) regulation (karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 14-16).

Biomedical Evidence:
Aberrant TM cell contractility plays a pivotal role in regulating aqueous humor outflow and IOP, key factors in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. The TM’s ability to adjust its contractility, dictated by cytoskeletal architecture and focal adhesion dynamics, directly influences aqueous humor drainage. In glaucomatous conditions, TM cells exhibit increased stiffness and altered mechanotransduction, generating larger traction forces and enhanced stress fiber formation compared to normal TM cells (karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 21-22, karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 22-24). Altered ECM stiffness not only affects cell spreading and contractility but also disrupts cell–matrix interactions, leading to increased IOP—a clinical hallmark of glaucoma (karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 3-4, sanchez2023characterizationofthe pages 10-15). Moreover, mechanotransductive signaling pathways, including those involving Rho/Rock, are known to modulate TM cell contractility and have been previously linked to glaucoma pathogenesis (lakk2020mechanicallyinducedcytoskeletal pages 1-4). These data collectively support the assay’s focus on measuring mechanical forces as directly relevant to both the disease’s pathobiology and its clinical manifestations.

Previous Use:
Traction force microscopy has been successfully applied in previous studies to differentiate the biomechanical behavior of normal versus glaucomatous TM cells. In the work by Karimi et al., dynamic TFM in a 3D FSI environment quantified traction forces that were significantly higher under flow conditions compared to static measurements, with glaucomatous TM cells consistently exerting larger forces (karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 14-16, karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 38-40). These findings not only confirm the assay’s sensitivity in detecting disease-specific alterations in TM cell contractility but also demonstrate its potential utility in monitoring pharmacological responses, such as the impact of ROCK inhibitors or actin depolymerizers on cellular mechanics (lakk2020mechanicallyinducedcytoskeletal pages 4-7).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of this TFM assay include its direct quantification of cell-generated forces, high physiological relevance through the use of biomimetic hydrogels and 3D culture with active FSI, and its ability to capture subtle differences in TM contractility that underpin glaucomatous pathology (karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 1-3, karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 22-24). The assay has been shown to yield detailed information on mechanical outputs that are directly linked to IOP regulation. Additionally, by providing a rapid readout of drug-induced changes in cellular biomechanics, it offers a powerful tool for early-stage therapeutic screening.

Conversely, challenges include the technical complexity of preparing consistent 3D bead-embedded hydrogels and the sophisticated imaging and computational analysis required to accurately quantify bead displacement, which might introduce variability (bikuna‐izagirre2022technologicaladvancesin pages 3-4, chu2014tissuebasedimagingmodel pages 6-8). Moreover, while the assay replicates key aspects of TM function, further validation in more complex in vivo-like systems may be necessary to fully capture the multifactorial nature of glaucoma.

In summary, the TFM assay described here is an innovative and robust platform with significant potential for screening drugs targeted at restoring normal TM cell biomechanics and thereby modulating IOP in glaucoma (karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 24-25, lu2020tissueengineeredmodelsfor pages 9-11).
