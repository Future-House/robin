Query: Comparative analysis of human donor-derived glaucomatous versus non-glaucomatous trabecular meshwork cell transcriptomic and proteomic signatures highlighting dysregulated ECM remodeling, TGF-β pathway activation, mechanotransduction, and candidate druggable targets

Human donor‐derived trabecular meshwork (TM) cells isolated from glaucomatous eyes exhibit distinct transcriptomic and proteomic signatures compared to those from non‐glaucomatous donors. These differences prominently involve dysregulated extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, enhanced transforming growth factor‐β (TGF-β) pathway activation, and alterations in mechanotransduction, which together contribute to increased aqueous humor outflow resistance and elevated intraocular pressure.

Comparative transcriptomic investigations have revealed that glaucomatous TM cells consistently overexpress genes involved in ECM synthesis and crosslinking. For example, increased expression of ECM components such as collagens and fibronectin and enhanced activity of matrix‐remodeling enzymes (e.g., lysyl oxidase and transglutaminase) have been observed, underscoring an aberrant, fibrotic response in the glaucomatous TM (asefa2022bioinformaticprioritizationand pages 28-30, kingston2024utilisingglaucomatousextracellular pages 37-40). These transcriptional changes are accompanied by corresponding proteomic shifts, where altered expression and deposition of ECM proteins result in increased tissue stiffness. Increased substrate rigidity further modulates cellular behavior through integrin-mediated signaling and actomyosin contractility, characteristic of mechanotransduction dysfunction (drewry2018genomewideexpressionprofiling pages 7-10, kingston2024utilisingglaucomatousextracellular pages 33-37).

TGF-β signaling is another central pathway repeatedly implicated in these analyses. Elevated levels of TGF-β2 in the aqueous humor of glaucoma patients lead to activation of both canonical SMAD-mediated and non-canonical signaling pathways in TM cells. These pathways induce transcriptional programs that not only promote ECM protein synthesis but also enhance the expression of fibrotic markers such as alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (asefa2022bioinformaticprioritizationand pages 28-30, kingston2024utilisingglaucomatousextracellular pages 158-161). TGF-β–induced upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) further diminishes matrix metalloproteinase activity, consequently impairing ECM degradation and amplifying matrix cross-linking. This dysregulation disrupts normal outflow facility, and transcriptomic studies highlight TGF-β as an upstream regulator in mechanically stretched TM cells (drewry2018genomewideexpressionprofiling pages 10-13, drewry2018genomewideexpressionprofiling pages 16-18).

Mechanotransduction signaling and ECM-derived biochemical cues also emerge as critical differentiators between glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous TM cells. Under conditions of mechanical stretch—a model often used to simulate the biomechanical stress experienced in vivo—TM cells show significant alterations in the expression of miRNAs (e.g., miR-21, miR-93) and their downstream target genes that regulate both ECM turnover and cellular contractility (drewry2018genomewideexpressionprofiling pages 13-16). These miRNA-mRNA networks modulate several signaling cascades, including Wnt and MAPK pathways, thereby linking biomechanical stress to pathological ECM remodeling (drewry2018genomewideexpressionprofiling pages 1-4).

The integration of these transcriptomic and proteomic profiles has identified several candidate druggable targets. Notably, genes such as BICC1 and AFAP1 have been prioritized due to their roles in ECM regulation and cellular motility (asefa2022bioinformaticprioritizationand pages 28-30). Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of Src signaling and modulation of PTEN activity have been proposed based on their mechanistic contribution to ECM deposition and TM fibrosis (asefa2022bioinformaticprioritizationand pages 28-30). Open Targets data further underscore the importance of MYOC, OPTN, and beta-adrenergic receptors as modulators of the TM ECM environment, with implications for current therapeutics that target intraocular pressure (OpenTargets Search: glaucoma).

In summary, the convergence of comparative transcriptomic and proteomic data underscores that glaucomatous TM cells display dysregulated ECM remodeling driven by overactive TGF-β signaling and aberrant mechanotransduction. This complex molecular landscape not only defines disease pathology but also highlights several promising targets for therapeutic intervention aimed at restoring normal TM function and facilitating aqueous outflow (kingston2024utilisingglaucomatousextracellular pages 213-216, nartey2021phenotypiccharacterizationof pages 139-142).
