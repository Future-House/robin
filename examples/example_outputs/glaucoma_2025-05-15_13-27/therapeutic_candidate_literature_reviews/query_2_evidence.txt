Query: Evidence of in vivo efficacy and safety of selective TGF-β pathway inhibitors for reducing intraocular pressure and preventing extracellular matrix remodeling in animal models of glaucoma, including detailed pharmacokinetic data on ocular tissue distribution, therapeutic window, and safety profiles

Selective inhibition of the TGF-β pathway has been investigated as a means to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) and prevent extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in animal models of glaucoma, although detailed pharmacokinetic data remain limited. Evidence from multiple preclinical and clinical studies demonstrates in vivo efficacy and safety of agents targeting TGF-β isoforms. For example, ISTH0036—a locked nucleic acid-modified antisense oligonucleotide selectively targeting TGF-β2—has been shown to provide sustained antifibrotic effects, with preclinical models demonstrating pharmacodynamic activity lasting up to eight weeks, which suggests a long ocular tissue half-life supportive of extended dosing intervals (pfeiffer2017…isth0036an pages 2-3). In a Phase I clinical context involving glaucoma patients undergoing trabeculectomy, ISTH0036 was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in postoperative IOP, with the two highest doses achieving postoperative IOP below 10 mmHg over a 12-week period, thus indicating its ability to effectively modulate fibrosis-induced outflow resistance (pfeiffer2017…isth0036an pages 11-13).

Preclinical efficacy is further supported by animal models that simulate glaucomatous ECM remodeling. In these models, selective TGF-β inhibitors, including agents like Pirfenidone, have been administered topically via eye drops to achieve inhibition of ECM deposition and reduction of pro-fibrotic mediators. Such studies in rabbits and rats have shown improved surgical bleb survival and maintained IOP reduction following glaucoma filtration procedures, reflecting the therapeutic potential of TGF-β pathway modulation in preserving aqueous humor outflow (shao2023noveltherapiesfor pages 5-6). These inhibitors have demonstrated their ability to limit fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix accumulation, which are critical determinants of post-surgical fibrosis and glaucoma progression (shao2023noveltherapiesfor pages 8-9).

Safety profiles in these studies appear favorable. In the case of ISTH0036, no significant ocular toxicity, as evidenced by electrophysiological assessments such as electroretinography (ERG), was noted in the clinical study, and similar favorable safety outcomes were observed in corresponding preclinical evaluations (pfeiffer2017…isth0036an pages 11-13). Additionally, other selective TGF-β inhibition strategies, including agents delivered via subconjunctival injection or topical application in animal models, reported improvements in bleb morphology and reduced fibrotic response without encountering significant local or systemic adverse effects (shao2023noveltherapiesfor pages 9-11).

However, the existing literature does not provide comprehensive, quantitative pharmacokinetic details such as ocular tissue distribution levels, precise therapeutic window ranges, or specific metabolic and excretory data in animal models. While some studies indirectly infer adequate intraocular drug retention through sustained pharmacodynamic responses (pfeiffer2017…isth0036an pages 13-14), and Yuwaiman2017 demonstrated antifibrotic efficacy via local delivery of selective MRTF/SRF inhibitors leading to bleb survival improvement (yuwaiman2017localdeliveryof pages 10-11), none of these reports fully delineate the ocular pharmacokinetics. Therefore, despite promising in vivo efficacy and safety signals for selective TGF-β pathway inhibitors in animal models of glaucoma, detailed pharmacokinetic parameters, including ocular tissue distribution, remain insufficiently characterized and warrant further investigation (pfeiffer2017…isth0036an pages 17-18).

In summary, preclinical and early clinical data support the efficacy and safety of selective TGF-β pathway inhibition in reducing IOP and preventing ECM remodeling in glaucoma models. These agents, exemplified by ISTH0036 and Pirfenidone, show potential in mitigating post-surgical fibrosis, yet the absence of detailed ocular pharmacokinetic profiles limits a complete understanding of their therapeutic windows and tissue biodistribution. Further dedicated studies are required to provide these critical pharmacokinetic insights before translating these interventions into broader clinical use (shao2023noveltherapiesfor pages 21-22).
