Query: Comprehensive review of scaffold-based and microenvironment-sensitive small-molecule delivery platforms targeting TGF-β-driven extracellular matrix contraction in ocular tissues, assessing biocompatibility, sustained release kinetics, and effects on trabecular meshwork cell contraction

Scaffold‐based and microenvironment‐sensitive small‐molecule delivery platforms targeting TGF‐β‐driven extracellular matrix (ECM) contraction in ocular tissues have emerged as promising strategies to regulate trabecular meshwork (TM) cell contraction and mitigate fibrosis in glaucoma. These delivery systems integrate engineered biomaterials that mimic native ECM properties with controlled release characteristics, offering both localized sustained therapeutic action and high biocompatibility.

Hydrogels are a key class of scaffolds that have been used for this purpose. Their inherent tunability enables matching the mechanical properties—particularly the stiffness—of healthy or glaucomatous TM tissue, which typically lies in the kilopascal range. This similarity in mechanical compliance is essential because substrate rigidity significantly influences TM cell behavior and their response to TGF‐β signaling. Hydrogels not only provide a moist, ECM-mimicking microenvironment supporting cell survival and function but also allow for controlled, sustained release of encapsulated small molecules or growth factors. This sustained delivery is critical to maintain therapeutic concentrations over time and to continuously modulate TGF‐β activity and ECM remodeling processes (kingston2024utilisingglaucomatousextracellular pages 63-66, nartey2021phenotypiccharacterizationof pages 32-36).

Nanoparticle-mediated platforms have also shown significant efficacy. In particular, non-viral gene therapy approaches using PEGylated cationic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver siRNA against MRTF-B—a transcription factor implicated in TGF‐β-driven fibrotic pathways—have demonstrated robust gene silencing. Such platforms achieve high encapsulation efficiencies (over 90%) and markedly reduce TM cell contraction by downregulating α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and type I collagen expression. Importantly, the inclusion of cleavable peptides like the cY peptide further enhances siRNA retention and cellular uptake while reducing particle size and potential cytotoxicity. These strategies directly attenuate fibrotic signaling, resulting in decreased ECM contraction and improved cellular biomechanics in TM cells (luo2022nonviralgenetherapy pages 12-13, luo2022nonviralgenetherapy pages 13-15).

Small molecule delivery through scaffold-based systems has also been pursued. For instance, the controlled release of ROCK inhibitors such as Y-27632 has been shown to counteract the cytoskeletal changes induced by TGF-β. By incorporating these inhibitors into biocompatible carriers or ECM-mimicking scaffolds, sustained inhibition of Rho-ROCK signaling can be achieved, leading to reduced expression of contractile proteins like α-SMA and disassembly of pathological stress fibers in TM cells. This dual action—relaxing the cytoskeleton and reducing fibronectin deposition—potentially improves aqueous humor outflow and alleviates intraocular pressure (buffault2022thedualeffect pages 8-10).

Engineered biomaterial strategies also focus on the interplay between scaffold composition and biochemical signaling. Natural ECM components or decellularized matrices provide binding domains for small molecules and growth factors, protecting them from premature degradation while allowing spatiotemporal control of release. These platforms are designed to preserve the bioactivity of therapeutics, ensure compatibility with ocular tissues, and prevent inflammatory responses, which are critical parameters for long-term treatment success in glaucoma management (guan2020engineeredbiomaterialstrategies pages 1-2, zhang2021suppressionoftgfβ1 pages 5-7).

Overall, the current evidence indicates that the combination of biomimetic scaffolds and microenvironment-responsive delivery platforms can provide localized, sustained modulation of TGF‐β signaling. By precisely controlling release kinetics and maintaining a physiologically relevant milieu, these approaches reduce TM cell contractility and curb pathological ECM remodeling. This integrated strategy holds promise for improving the outcomes of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery and ultimately for the treatment of glaucoma (luo2022nonviralgenetherapy pages 16-17, santra2022humansmilederivedstromal pages 15-17).
