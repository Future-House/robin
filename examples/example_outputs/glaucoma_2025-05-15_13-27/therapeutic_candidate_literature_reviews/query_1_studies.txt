Query: Studies on high-throughput screening of focused small-molecule libraries using collagen gel contraction assays in glaucomatous human trabecular meshwork cells to identify selective TGF-β signaling inhibitors with evidence of target engagement, pathway modulation, and ocular safety profiles

The available context indicates that no clinical trials or formal studies have been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov that specifically employ collagen gel contraction assays in glaucomatous human trabecular meshwork cells to screen focused small-molecule libraries for selective TGF-β signaling inhibitors with clear evidence of target engagement, pathway modulation, and ocular safety profiles (Clinical Trial Search: collagen gel contraction assay AND trabecular meshwork AND TGF-β inhibitor). In essence, while such an approach appears rational and scientifically grounded, the literature and trial databases do not yet document any registered or published work meeting these exact criteria.

Nevertheless, multiple excerpts provide a robust scientific rationale for pursuing such a screening strategy. TGF-β signaling is implicated in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and fibrosis within the trabecular meshwork—a key pathophysiological mechanism underlying elevated intraocular pressure in glaucoma (lamb2021potentialofmuller pages 43-47, lamb2021potentialofmuller pages 35-39). This underlines the therapeutic potential of targeting the TGF-β pathway to mitigate glaucomatous damage. Furthermore, collagen gel contraction assays represent a well-established in vitro model to assess cellular contractility and ECM remodeling; such assays are ideally suited to measure changes induced by TGF-β activation or inhibition in trabecular meshwork cells (lamb2021potentialofmuller pages 32-35, soler2022oculardrugdelivery pages 38-42).

The use of high-throughput screening with focused small-molecule libraries would enable efficient identification of compounds that are selective inhibitors of TGF-β signaling. In this context, evidence of target engagement would be derived from biochemical markers and changes in cellular contractility measured by the collagen gel contraction assay. Meanwhile, confirmation of pathway modulation might involve downstream readouts such as altered expression of ECM proteins and other fibrosis-related markers. However, the available context does not provide specific experimental data or detailed outcomes from such screens, indicating a current knowledge gap in both preclinical assay development and clinical evaluation (Clinical Trial Search: collagen gel contraction assay AND trabecular meshwork AND TGF-β inhibitor).

Ocular safety profiles remain a critical aspect for any candidate inhibitor. Several excerpts discussing ocular drug delivery strategies emphasize the importance of ocular pharmacokinetics and tissue-specific delivery mechanisms (soler2022oculardrugdelivery pages 101-105, soler2022oculardrugdelivery pages 120-125). While these documents mostly focus on drug delivery methods and alternative pathways such as the renin-angiotensin system, they reinforce the concept that any new therapeutic candidate—once identified through high-throughput in vitro assays like the collagen gel contraction assay—must exhibit minimal ocular toxicity and appropriate pharmacodynamic profiles in ocular tissues.

In summary, despite the scientific justification for this approach provided by the mechanistic insights into TGF-β signaling in glaucoma (lamb2021potentialofmuller pages 43-47, soler2022oculardrugdelivery pages 38-42) and the utility of collagen gel contraction assays to model ECM remodeling, there is currently no available evidence or published study demonstrating high-throughput screening of focused small-molecule libraries using these assays in glaucomatous human trabecular meshwork cells. This absence of evidence indicates a significant gap in the field, highlighting the need for future studies that incorporate robust endpoints such as target engagement, pathway modulation, and ocular safety assessments before advancing such compounds toward clinical use (Clinical Trial Search: collagen gel contraction assay AND trabecular meshwork AND TGF-β inhibitor).
