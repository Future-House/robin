Query: Literature on small-molecule inhibitors originally developed for systemic fibrotic diseases (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) repurposed for ocular application: focusing on TGF-β receptor kinase inhibitors with evidence of trabecular meshwork ECM modulation, pharmacokinetics, and ocular safety from preclinical or early clinical studies

The current literature indicates that small‐molecule TGF‑β receptor kinase inhibitors, initially developed for systemic fibrotic diseases (such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), presently have limited direct clinical evaluation when repurposed for ocular applications, particularly for trabecular meshwork extracellular matrix (ECM) modulation. A comprehensive ClinicalTrials.gov search using terms relevant to “TGF‑β receptor kinase inhibitor” along with “ocular,” “glaucoma,” “trabecular meshwork,” and “fibrosis” yielded zero registered trials. This clearly shows that, to date, there are no formal clinical investigations directly assessing these compounds for ocular indications, including pharmacokinetics and safety profiles in the eye (Clinical Trials Search: TGF-beta receptor kinase inhibitor AND (ocular OR glaucoma OR trabecular meshwork) AND (fibrosis OR ECM modulation)).

Despite this clinical gap, the preclinical literature offers promising mechanistic insights. Several small‐molecule inhibitors, such as SB431542 and LY2109761, have been targeted at inhibiting TGF‑β receptor type I (ALK5) kinase activity, thereby blocking downstream TGF‑β signaling responsible for upregulation of collagen and other ECM components. For instance, SB431542 has demonstrated the ability to reduce collagen expression in rabbit models of corneal fibrosis, supporting its potential role in mitigating ECM remodeling and fibrotic processes in ocular tissues (ogata2024tgfβbasedtherapiesfor pages 11-12). Such antifibrotic effects are mechanistically relevant since TGF‑β signaling is a known contributor to trabecular meshwork fibrosis that elevates intraocular pressure in glaucoma.

Furthermore, the literature acknowledges that while systemic exposure to TGF‑β receptor kinase inhibitors has been more thoroughly evaluated in non-ocular contexts, there is an emerging rationale to repurpose these agents for localized ocular applications. Preclinical evidences provided in reviews delineate that localized administration (e.g., topical or intracameral routes) could afford sufficient drug concentrations within anterior segment tissues with minimal systemic side effects. However, detailed pharmacokinetic profiles following ocular administration, such as tissue distribution, ocular half-life, and metabolic clearance on the ocular surface, remain underexplored (ogata2024tgfβbasedtherapiesfor pages 19-20).

Ocular safety is another critical consideration. Systemic TGF‑β inhibition is associated with risks stemming from the blockade of TGF‑β’s homeostatic functions in various tissues. For topical ocular applications, early preclinical data suggest that delivering small-molecule inhibitors directly to the eye may mitigate such risks; nevertheless, specific safety endpoints, including inflammatory responses or off-target effects in ocular tissues, have not yet been comprehensively detailed in the existing reports (zhang2020tgfβpathwayin pages 18-20). Comparable therapeutic approaches, such as the use of anti‑TGF‑β2 antibodies post‑glaucoma surgery, have shown acceptable local safety profiles, which provides indirect support for the feasibility of employing kinase inhibitors in similar settings (zhang2020tgfβpathwayin pages 18-20).

In summary, while there is robust preclinical rationale for repurposing small‑molecule TGF‑β receptor kinase inhibitors to address trabecular meshwork ECM remodeling in ocular diseases, key data on ocular pharmacokinetics and safety are currently limited to preclinical observations and analogous evidence from related therapeutic strategies. Further targeted preclinical studies and early phase clinical trials are necessary to elucidate these critical parameters and to overcome the translational challenges from systemic to localized ophthalmic applications (Clinical Trials Search: TGF-beta receptor kinase inhibitor AND (ocular OR glaucoma OR trabecular meshwork) AND (fibrosis OR ECM modulation), ogata2024tgfβbasedtherapiesfor pages 11-12, 19-20).
