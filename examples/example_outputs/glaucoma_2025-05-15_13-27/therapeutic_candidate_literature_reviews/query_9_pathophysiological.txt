Query: Pathophysiological role of oxidative stress and TGF-β signaling interactions in promoting fibrotic changes and impaired cellular contractility in trabecular meshwork cells from glaucoma patients, with insights into redox modulation strategies

Oxidative stress, defined as an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidant defenses, plays a critical role in activating latent TGF-β present in trabecular meshwork (TM) cells from glaucoma patients, thereby initiating profibrotic signaling cascades (chen2021characterizationoftgfβ pages 1-2). ROS enhance the conversion of latent TGF-β into its active isoforms, predominantly TGF-β1 and TGF-β2, which then engage both canonical Smad-dependent and noncanonical signaling pathways such as p38 MAPK, JNK, and AKT in TM cells (chen2021characterizationoftgfβ pages 24-26).

Once activated, TGF-β signaling promotes the expression of fibrotic markers—including collagen I, laminin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)—and increases extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, which collectively contribute to the stiffening and thickening of the trabecular meshwork (chen2021characterizationoftgfβ pages 28-29). This aberrant ECM remodeling impairs the aqueous humor outflow, leading to elevated intraocular pressure, a hallmark of glaucoma pathogenesis (rao2019mitochondrialtargetedantioxidantsattenuate pages 1-2).

In addition to ECM accumulation, TGF-β signaling profoundly influences cellular contractility within the TM by altering cytoskeletal dynamics and promoting stress fiber formation. The reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the generation of cross-linked actin networks reduce the contractile function of TM cells, exacerbating outflow resistance (rao2019mitochondrialtargetedantioxidantsattenuate pages 2-2). This impaired contractility is further compounded by ongoing oxidative stress, which perpetuates the activation of TGF-β signaling and creates a self-amplifying cycle of fibrosis and functional decline (roodnat2024genomewidernasequencing pages 19-20).

The interplay between oxidative stress and TGF-β signaling is also influenced by the activity of stress-responsive kinases, such as p38 MAPK, which not only mediate downstream effects of TGF-β but also regulate TGF-β levels themselves in a positive feedback loop (chen2021characterizationoftgfβ pages 26-28). Such intertwined signaling further drives the production of fibrotic mediators and promotes senescence, contributing to the overall pathological remodeling observed in glaucoma.

Redox modulation strategies have been explored to interrupt this deleterious cycle. Mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants, for example, have shown promise in attenuating TGF-β2-induced ROS production and reducing downstream Smad2/3 signaling activity, thereby decreasing the expression of profibrotic markers like connective tissue growth factor and various collagens (rao2019mitochondrialtargetedantioxidantsattenuate pages 1-2). This therapeutic approach highlights the potential of targeting mitochondrial oxidative stress to restore normal TM cell function and improve aqueous humor outflow.

Furthermore, redox-sensitive transcription factors such as nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) are critical for maintaining the cellular antioxidant response. Downregulation of Nrf2 in TM cells contributes to increased ROS levels and fibrosis, whereas its activation has been linked to upregulation of antioxidant enzymes and the suppression of fibrotic processes via modulation of ECM synthesis (wang2020thepotentialrole pages 2-3). Agents that enhance Nrf2 activity may therefore serve as an effective strategy to counteract both oxidative stress and TGF-β–mediated fibrotic remodeling.

In conclusion, the synergistic interaction between oxidative stress and TGF-β signaling drives profibrotic changes and impairs contractility in trabecular meshwork cells through enhanced ECM deposition, cytoskeletal reorganization, and positive feedback loops involving stress kinases. Redox modulation strategies, including mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants and Nrf2 activation, offer promising avenues to mitigate these pathological alterations and potentially slow glaucoma progression (chen2021characterizationoftgfβ pages 28-29, rao2019mitochondrialtargetedantioxidantsattenuate pages 2-2, roodnat2024genomewidernasequencing pages 19-20, wang2020thepotentialrole pages 2-3).
