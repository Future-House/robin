Query: Cellular and molecular mechanisms by which TGF-β induces extracellular matrix protein expression (e.g., fibronectin, collagen I and III) and actomyosin-mediated contraction in human trabecular meshwork cells, including cross-talk with ROCK, YAP/TAZ, and integrin signaling pathways

TGF-β initiates extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells through a combination of canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways. In the canonical SMAD-dependent pathway, TGF-β binds to its type II and type I receptor complexes, resulting in phosphorylation of receptor-regulated SMADs (SMAD2 and SMAD3). These phosphorylated SMADs then form complexes with SMAD4 and translocate to the nucleus, where they drive the transcription of genes coding for ECM proteins such as fibronectin and collagens I and III, as well as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) that further reinforces ECM production (hassan2023connectivetissuegrowth pages 2-4).

In parallel, TGF-β activates several non-SMAD pathways that contribute to enhanced ECM deposition and actomyosin-mediated contraction. One key non-canonical pathway is the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including ERK, JNK, and p38, which can modulate gene expression and interact with the SMAD pathway to amplify the fibrotic response (hassan2023connectivetissuegrowth pages 4-5, shao2023noveltherapiesfor pages 2-4).

A central component of the non-SMAD response is the RhoA/ROCK signaling axis. TGF-β stimulation leads to the activation of RhoA, which in turn activates Rho-associated kinase (ROCK). ROCK enhances actomyosin contractility by phosphorylating myosin light chain (MLC) and promoting the formation of F-actin stress fibers and the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), key markers of contractile and myofibroblast-like phenotypes. The consequences of ROCK activation are twofold: not only does it increase cellular contractility, contributing to the mechanical tightening and stiffness of the TM tissue, but it also promotes an environment conducive to further ECM deposition (li2022yaptazmediatetgfβ2induced pages 16-21, liu2021rhoarockyaptazaxisregulates pages 6-11).

Concomitantly, mechanosensitive transcriptional co-activators, Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), become activated in response to the increased actomyosin tension. Their nuclear localization is facilitated by alterations in the cytoskeletal architecture mediated by ROCK. Once in the nucleus, YAP/TAZ interact with TEAD transcription factors to upregulate the expression of additional profibrotic genes, including CTGF, fibronectin, and collagen genes. This feed-forward mechanism further enhances ECM production and reinforces the contractile phenotype (li2022yaptazmediatetgfβ2induced pages 21-24, li2022yaptazmediatetgfβ2induced pages 28-30).

Integrin signaling is also integral to this process. Integrins serve as the primary receptors for ECM proteins and mediate bidirectional signal transduction between the extracellular and intracellular environments. The engagement of integrins with newly synthesized ECM components such as fibronectin and collagens reinforces focal adhesion assembly and cytoskeletal reorganization. This integrin-mediated mechanotransduction not only stabilizes the cellular alterations induced by TGF-β but also amplifies ROCK and YAP/TAZ signaling, establishing a positive feedback loop that perpetuates ECM deposition and contractile activity (zhang2023extracellularmatrixmechanicsregulate pages 2-4, hameed2021anoverviewof pages 8-9).

Ultimately, the combined actions of SMAD-dependent transcriptional activation, ROCK-mediated actomyosin contractility, YAP/TAZ-driven gene expression, and integrin-facilitated mechanosensitive signaling lead to a profound remodeling of the TM. These molecular and cellular changes increase tissue stiffness and reduce aqueous humor outflow, which are critical factors in the pathogenesis of glaucoma (li2022yaptazmediatetgfβ2induced pages 11-16, zhang2023extracellularmatrixmechanicsregulate pages 4-6).

Thus, TGF-β exerts its profibrotic effects in human trabecular meshwork cells by orchestrating a complex interplay among SMAD pathways, ROCK-mediated cytoskeletal dynamics, YAP/TAZ transcriptional co-activation, and integrin signaling, all of which converge to promote ECM protein expression and actomyosin-mediated contraction.
