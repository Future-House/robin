Query: Analysis of clinical and translational studies evaluating safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of intravitreal or topical TGF-β neutralizing biologics and small molecules in glaucoma or other ocular fibrotic conditions, including biomarkers of ECM remodeling and intraocular pressure changes

The current body of evidence on intravitreal or topical TGF-β neutralizing agents in glaucoma and ocular fibrotic conditions is largely preclinical and translational, with a notable absence of registered clinical trials reporting definitive safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic data based on ClinicalTrials.gov records. In fact, a comprehensive search using terms that combined TGF-β, the routes of administration (intravitreal or topical), drug classes (biologics, antibodies, or small molecules), disease conditions (glaucoma, ocular fibrosis), and key therapeutic endpoints (safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, biomarkers, or intraocular pressure) yielded zero trials (Clinical Trials Search: TGF-beta OR transforming growth factor beta AND intravitreal OR topical AND biologic OR antibody OR small molecule AND glaucoma OR ocular fibrosis OR ocular fibrotic AND safety OR tolerability OR pharmacodynamics OR biomarker OR intraocular pressure).

One of the most detailed translational studies involves the TGF-β neutralizing antibody lerdelimumab (CAT-152), a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeting TGF-β2—the prominent isoform implicated in ocular scarring. Lerdelimumab was examined in the context of glaucoma surgery as an anti-scarring therapy delivered via subconjunctival injections before and after surgery. Early-phase (Phase I and II) clinical trials demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and tolerability. However, a subsequent Phase III study with 388 patients (those with primary open-angle glaucoma or chronic angle-closure glaucoma) failed to show a statistically significant improvement in surgical success when compared with placebo (rahic2020noveldrugdeliverya pages 33-34, ogata2024tgfβbasedtherapiesfor pages 10-11). This suggests that although the agent was pharmacodynamically active in inhibiting TGF-β2, its clinical efficacy in modulating extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition—an endpoint closely tied to scar formation—and its effects on intraocular pressure (IOP) were not sufficiently evidenced.

Beyond lerdelimumab, other TGF-β-targeted therapies have been investigated in preclinical models for their ability to attenuate fibrosis via modulation of ECM remodeling. For example, small-molecule inhibitors such as SB431542 and LY2109761 have shown promising results in reducing collagen expression and myofibroblast differentiation in corneal fibrosis models, indicating a potential role in reducing post-surgical scarring (ogata2024tgfβbasedtherapiesfor pages 11-12). However, despite these encouraging mechanistic insights, there remains a gap in translating these observations into clinical pharmacodynamic evaluations that specifically quantify ECM remodeling biomarkers or IOP changes.

In several reviews, comprehensive overviews of TGF-β–modulating therapies underscore the challenges of balancing antifibrotic efficacy with the disruptions of physiological processes mediated by TGF-β. While preclinical studies demonstrate that targeting TGF-β can modulate key biomarkers—such as the expression of collagen, decorin, and other ECM components—the explicit measurement of these biomarkers in a clinical setting post-treatment is limited (ogata2024tgfβbasedtherapiesfor pages 16-18). Similarly, although intraocular pressure is a critical measurement in glaucoma, none of the current clinical studies provide robust data correlating TGF-β neutralization with changes in IOP (ogata2024tgfβbasedtherapiesfor pages 8-10).

Furthermore, additional approaches—including antisense oligonucleotides, peptide-based inhibitors, and fusion proteins like AVID200—are being explored to selectively modulate aspects of TGF-β signaling. Yet, most of these technologies remain in early translational or preclinical stages with either limited human data or none at all regarding ocular pharmacodynamics (ogata2024tgfβbasedtherapiesfor pages 18-19).

In summary, while translational studies provide a compelling mechanistic rationale for the use of intravitreal or topical TGF-β neutralizing agents to reduce ECM deposition and potentially improve surgical outcomes in glaucoma and other ocular fibrotic conditions, clinical trial data remain insufficient. Lerdelimumab, for instance, is safe and well tolerated, but its lack of significant efficacy and the absence of detailed pharmacodynamic assessments—particularly concerning ECM biomarkers and IOP modulation—highlight the need for further targeted studies to better define therapeutic windows and patient subgroups who might benefit from these interventions (rahic2020noveldrugdeliverya pages 33-34, ogata2024tgfβbasedtherapiesfor pages 10-11).
