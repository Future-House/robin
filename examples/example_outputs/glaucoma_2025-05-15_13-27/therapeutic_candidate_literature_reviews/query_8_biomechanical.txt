Query: Biomechanical characterization of glaucomatous trabecular meshwork extracellular matrix stiffness and contractile behavior: studies using collagen gel models, atomic force microscopy, and relevance to aqueous humor outflow resistance

Glaucomatous alterations in the trabecular meshwork (TM) extracellular matrix (ECM) are now recognized as key contributors to increased aqueous humor outflow resistance and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), a hallmark of primary open‐angle glaucoma. The TM is a porous, multilayered tissue critical for regulating aqueous humor drainage, and changes in its ECM composition and mechanical properties, notably stiffness and contractile behavior, play a central role in glaucoma pathogenesis (dautriche20153dbioengineeringofthea pages 20-23).

Collagen gel models have been widely used to mimic the fibrous ECM environment of the TM. These in vitro platforms are engineered to recapitulate the native composition and structure of the TM ECM, enabling the study of cellular contractility and matrix remodeling under controlled conditions. In these models, TM cells embedded in collagen gels demonstrate contractile activity that reflects the behavior of actin cytoskeletal elements interacting with ECM fibers. Notably, studies have indicated that TM cells derived from glaucomatous tissue, or those exposed to fibrogenic stimuli, tend to exert augmented contractile forces on the surrounding collagen matrix, leading to densification and stiffening of the gel. This phenomenon is highly significant because increased contractility and ECM deposition are directly linked to reduced outflow facility and elevated IOP (dautriche20153dbioengineeringoftheb pages 20-23, lu2020tissueengineeredmodelsfor pages 7-9).

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a complementary, high-resolution approach for biomechanical characterization of the TM ECM. AFM measurements have been pivotal in quantifying local variations in stiffness at the micro- and nanoscale. In glaucomatous TM tissue, AFM studies consistently show an increase in elastic modulus, with some reports indicating up to a 20-fold enhancement compared to normal tissue. Such stiffness correlates with the excessive deposition of ECM components—such as collagen types, elastin, and fibronectin—and altered crosslinking dynamics, often mediated by elevated levels of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β2) and enzymes like lysyl oxidase. These changes in the mechanical properties of the ECM are believed to impair the normal deformation and compliance of the TM, thereby increasing resistance to aqueous humor outflow (karimi2022biomechanicsofhuman pages 1-3, stamer2015biomechanicsofschlemms pages 7-7).

Furthermore, advanced studies integrating collagen gel contraction assays with AFM measurements have underscored a complex feedback loop in glaucomatous TM. Here, increased ECM stiffness amplifies TM cell contractility, which in turn promotes further ECM remodeling and stiffening—a cycle that exacerbates outflow resistance. Such findings are supported by evidence showing that TM cells cultured on stiffer, collagen-based substrates generate higher traction forces and develop more pronounced stress fibers compared to cells on compliant, normal-like matrices (karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 1-3, karimi2024comparativeanalysisof pages 3-4). Additionally, AFM’s capacity to resolve spatial heterogeneities in ECM stiffness across different regions of the TM, such as the juxtacanalicular connective tissue (JCT) adjacent to Schlemm’s canal, is crucial because these localized variations directly affect aqueous humor dynamics (kingston2024utilisingglaucomatousextracellular pages 46-50).

Dynamic models further highlight that pathological ECM stiffening disrupts the normal biomechanical environment necessary for maintaining outflow facility. Investigations using both collagen gel models and AFM have provided mechanistic insights into how dysregulated Rho kinase and other mechanotransductive pathways modulate TM cell behavior and ECM organization, ultimately culminating in increased outflow resistance (raghunathan2018glaucomatouscellderived pages 17-21, safa2022glaucomaandbiomechanics pages 1-3, shah2021microviscoelasticpropertiesof pages 18-24, shah2021microviscoelasticpropertiesof pages 94-98).

In summary, the integration of collagen gel contraction assays and AFM-based stiffness measurements has substantially advanced our understanding of glaucomatous TM biomechanics. These experimental tools elucidate how increased ECM stiffness and enhanced contractile behavior of TM cells create a self-reinforcing system that impairs aqueous humor outflow, thereby contributing to elevated IOP and glaucoma progression (dautriche20153dbioengineeringofthea pages 20-23, lu2020tissueengineeredmodelsfor pages 7-9, stamer2015biomechanicsofschlemms pages 7-7).
