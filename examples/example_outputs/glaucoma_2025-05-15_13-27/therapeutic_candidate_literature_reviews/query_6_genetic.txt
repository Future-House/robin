Query: Genetic association studies linking polymorphisms or mutations in TGF-β pathway components (e.g., TGFB1, TGFBR2, SMAD3) with primary open-angle glaucoma susceptibility and progression, and functional validation in trabecular meshwork cells

Genetic association studies have predominantly focused on TGFB1 variants in relation to primary open‐angle glaucoma (POAG) susceptibility and progression, while evidence for associations with TGFBR2 and SMAD3 variants is less robust. Several studies have identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TGFB1 gene that may modulate glaucoma risk. For example, one study in a Mexican cohort demonstrated that a haplotype comprising the C allele of rs1800469 (−509C/T), the A allele of rs1800468 (−800G/A), and the C allele of rs1800471 (+915G/C) was associated with an increased risk of POAG, with an odds ratio of 2.74. Although individual SNPs such as rs1800471 were not standalone predictors, the combination affecting both expression and secretion of TGF-β1 suggests that even relatively modest alterations in TGFB1 levels can contribute to disease pathology (cruzpavlovich2022relaciónentrelos pages 7-8). Similarly, investigations in various populations, including Indian and Iranian cohorts, have examined polymorphisms such as the TGFB1 −509C>T and G915C (Arg25Pro) variants. While some studies report associations between the mutant T allele and increased POAG risk (abadi…2019theassociationbetween pages 4-6, thakur2021associationoftgfb pages 1-2), other studies did not find statistically significant associations, suggesting that population-specific factors may influence genetic risk profiles (pantou…2018theassociationbetween pages 3-5, pantou…2018theassociationbetween pages 6-7).

Functional validation experiments have provided important context for these genetic findings. In vitro studies using cultured human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells have consistently demonstrated that TGF-β isoforms, particularly TGF-β1 and TGF-β2, affect TM cell behavior. TGF-β1 has been shown to induce a myofibroblast-like phenotype in TM cells characterized by increased expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, enhanced contractility, and increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. This is significant because such changes in the TM contribute to reduced aqueous humor outflow and elevated intraocular pressure, key drivers in the progression of POAG (pantou…2018theassociationbetween pages 5-6, iglesias2015genespathwaysand pages 11-12). Additionally, evidence from experimental models indicates that TGF-β2, although not the primary focus of all genetic studies, plays a prominent role in fibrotic remodeling of the TM. Such functional data lend biological plausibility to TGFB1 polymorphisms influencing glaucoma risk through direct cellular effects (gauthier2017epigeneticsandsignaling pages 2-3).

Furthermore, while Open Targets Platform analyses highlight that TGFB1 has a measurable, though low, association score with POAG, both TGFBR2 and SMAD3 lack compelling genetic evidence in this context. These findings suggest that, at least based on current literature, the pathogenic mechanisms in glaucoma may rely more on altered expression or protein hyperactivation of TGF-β1, rather than on direct genetic variants in its receptor (TGFBR2) or downstream effector (SMAD3) (OpenTargets Search: primary open-angle glaucoma-TGFB1,TGFBR2,SMAD3).

Notably, clinical trial registrations did not yield any observational studies directly investigating these genetic variants in the context of POAG, highlighting a gap between basic molecular research and clinical translational studies (Clinical Trials Search: AREA[Condition]primary open-angle glaucoma AND (TGFB1 OR TGFBR2 OR SMAD3 OR TGF-β) AND AREA[StudyType]OBSERVATIONAL).

In summary, the existing body of genetic association studies primarily supports a role for TGFB1 polymorphisms in modulating POAG susceptibility, with functional validations in TM cells providing mechanistic insights. However, the contributions of TGFBR2 and SMAD3 remain less defined, indicating a need for further focused studies integrating both genetic association and functional validation approaches.
