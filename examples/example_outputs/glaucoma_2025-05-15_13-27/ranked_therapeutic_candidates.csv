"Netarsudil, a dual rho kinase and norepinephrine transporter inhibitor.","Proposal for Netarsudil, a dual rho kinase and norepinephrine transporter inhibitor.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Netarsudil is a fully synthetic small‐molecule agent discovered and optimized for ocular hypotensive activity. It was developed through systematic medicinal chemistry efforts targeted at modulating aqueous humor outflow in the eye. As a member of the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor class, Netarsudil belongs to a subclass of compounds that were originally designed to interfere with intracellular signaling pathways controlling actin cytoskeletal contraction. Rho kinase inhibitors have been explored extensively in both preclinical and clinical settings because of their ability to affect cell contractility and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. In the case of Netarsudil, its chemical design compounds an amino‐isoquinoline amide moiety with a 2,4-dimethyl benzoate ester, a structure that ensures potent inhibition of both ROCK isoforms (ROCK1 and ROCK2) as well as an ancillary inhibitory effect on the norepinephrine transporter (NET) (Dasso et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018). This compound was synthesized de novo in the laboratory and optimized for stability, corneal penetration, and a sustained pharmacodynamic effect, positioning it as a novel agent in the therapeutic arsenal against glaucoma. The ROCK inhibitor class has historically been used to address syndromes related to abnormal cytoskeletal dynamics in various tissues, and its application in the ophthalmic field marks an extension of that pharmacological paradigm into conditions where increased outflow resistance raises intraocular pressure (IOP).

Therapeutic History:
The development of Netarsudil is anchored in extensive preclinical and clinical research over the past decade. ROCK inhibitors, including earlier experimental compounds like Y-27632 and fasudil, were initially studied for their ability to relax vascular smooth muscle and modulate cytoskeletal dynamics in various tissue types (Moshirfar, 2018). However, Netarsudil uniquely combines ROCK inhibition with a secondary mechanism involving inhibition of the norepinephrine transporter (NET). This dual activity not only relaxes the trabecular meshwork (TM) cells through a direct ROCK-mediated effect but also influences the neurohumoral regulation of aqueous humor production. Preclinical studies in animal models – including primate and rabbit studies – have consistently demonstrated that Netarsudil can lower IOP by approximately 20–25% via enhanced aqueous humor outflow and reductions in episcleral venous pressure (Lin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2024). Clinically, multiple phase 2 and phase 3 trials have established its efficacy in patients with ocular hypertension and open-angle glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2012; 2014; 2016a; 2016b; 2019; 2020). These trials compared Netarsudil against established treatments such as timolol, latanoprost, and even fixed-dose combinations with latanoprost (Gonzalez & Boylan, 2021; Dikopf et al., 2017). Its favorable safety profile and its ability to reduce IOP through a mechanism distinct from traditional agents have led to its FDA approval for glaucoma management, further bolstered by robust translational research. Notably, while the ROCK inhibitor class has been explored in various contexts, there is no relevant history of veterinary use or repurposing from other indications, since Netarsudil was purpose-designed for human glaucoma treatment (Cvenkel & Kolko, 2020; Sharif, 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
Netarsudil’s mechanism of action is rooted in its dual pharmacology, targeting both Rho kinase enzymes and the norepinephrine transporter. On the molecular level, Rho kinase (ROCK) is activated by GTP-bound RhoA and is responsible for phosphorylating substrates such as myosin light chain (MLC) and myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1) (Singh & Singh, 2023). This phosphorylation promotes actomyosin contraction and focal adhesion formation within trabecular meshwork cells, contributing to increased cellular stiffness and ECM deposition. In glaucoma, enhanced ROCK activity in the TM is one of the critical contributors to outflow resistance (Halasz & Townes-Anderson, 2016; Sturdivant et al., 2016). Inhibition of ROCK by Netarsudil reduces MLC phosphorylation, thereby diminishing stress fiber formation and leading to a relaxation of TM cells. This relaxation of the cytoskeleton effectively decreases the resistance to aqueous humor outflow through the conventional pathway comprised of the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm’s canal, resulting in lower intraocular pressure (Lin et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2023).

In addition to its ROCK inhibitory activity, Netarsudil also blocks the norepinephrine transporter (NET). By attenuating NET activity, Netarsudil affects adrenergic signaling within ocular tissues, which may lead to a reduction in aqueous humor production and a lowering of episcleral venous pressure. The inhibition of NET is hypothesized to produce vasoconstrictive effects—reducing blood flow to the ciliary processes—and thus modulating the production rate of aqueous humor. This combined dual mechanism of action—direct mechanical relaxation of TM cells through ROCK inhibition plus reduced aqueous humor production through NET inhibition—constitutes a unique therapeutic strategy that addresses both the inflow and outflow aspects of aqueous dynamics (Singh & Singh, 2023; Wu et al., 2024). Further molecular studies have confirmed that Netarsudil induces cytoskeletal remodeling in trabecular meshwork cells by decreasing actin stress fiber density, reducing focal adhesion complexes, and modulating ECM deposition through the inhibition of TGF-β signaling pathways (Moshirfar, 2018; Sturdivant et al., 2016). These molecular alterations collectively facilitate enhanced aqueous humor drainage, resulting in a sustained decrease in intraocular pressure. Furthermore, the expression of Rho kinase in trabecular meshwork cells—documented in immunohistochemical assays—supports the therapeutic rationale for targeting this enzyme in glaucoma (Singh & Singh, 2023; Dikopf et al., 2017).

Expected Effect:
In the context of glaucoma therapy, the application of Netarsudil is expected to produce a significant reduction in intraocular pressure due to enhanced aqueous humor outflow. The expected primary effect in the proposed assays is the inhibition of ROCK-mediated cytoskeletal contraction in the trabecular meshwork. This inhibition leads to the relaxation of TM cells, thereby reducing the resistance offered by the conventional outflow pathway. As a consequence, there is enhanced outflow of aqueous humor through Schlemm’s canal—a critical pathway implicated in the regulation of IOP (Wang et al., 2023; Singh & Singh, 2023). In addition, the secondary activity of NET inhibition is anticipated to reduce aqueous humor production through modulation of adrenergic signaling, which is supported by literature indicating that adrenergic receptors and transporters are present in the ciliary body and trabecular cells (Dasso et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018). This dual mechanistic approach not only harnesses the biomechanical effect on aqueous outflow but also exerts a neurohumoral modulation that further contributes to lowering IOP. Preclinical models have demonstrated that the administration of Netarsudil results in a dose-dependent reduction in IOP, with significant decreases observed within a few hours of topical administration, and sustained effects observed over a 24-hour period (Liu et al., 2024; Mehta et al., 2022). The literature also supports the notion that by decreasing extracellular matrix deposition and reducing cellular contractility in the TM, Netarsudil can mitigate the pathologic remodeling that contributes to resistance in aqueous humor outflow. In an assay setting, one would expect to see a measurable increase in the outflow facility and a reduction in the contractile markers such as phosphorylated MLC within trabecular meshwork cells, which would corroborate its mechanism of action (Halasz & Townes-Anderson, 2016; Sturdivant et al., 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
Netarsudil stands out as a promising therapeutic candidate for glaucoma due to its dual mechanism of action that directly targets the underlying pathophysiology of elevated intraocular pressure. Its strengths include a well-defined molecular mechanism: by inhibiting ROCK, it directly modulates the cytoskeletal dynamics in the trabecular meshwork, thereby reducing cellular stiffness and resistance in the aqueous humor outflow pathway. The additional NET inhibitory property complements this primary action by reducing aqueous humor production and lowering episcleral venous pressure—a combination that is not typically observed with conventional glaucoma medications (Singh & Singh, 2023; Wu et al., 2024). The extensive preclinical and clinical evaluation of Netarsudil, including multiple phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2012; 2014; 2016b; 2020), provides robust evidence of its efficacy and safety profile in reducing IOP in patients with ocular hypertension and open-angle glaucoma (Gonzalez & Boylan, 2021; Dikopf et al., 2017). Moreover, its FDA approval as an ophthalmic solution underscores its translational readiness and clinical utility (Cvenkel & Kolko, 2020; Sharif, 2023).

Nonetheless, there are some considerations to bear in mind. The most common adverse event associated with Netarsudil is conjunctival hyperemia, which, although generally mild and transient, may affect patient compliance in the long term (Dasso et al., 2018; Mehta et al., 2022). There is also a potential concern regarding the precise contributions of its NET inhibition compared to its ROCK inhibitory activity. While the combined activity is theoretically advantageous, further detailed investigations into the relative importance of each mechanism in clinical settings could help refine dosing strategies or combination therapies (Singh & Singh, 2023; Halasz & Townes-Anderson, 2016). In addition, given that the majority of the current data are derived from controlled clinical trials, real-world studies may be necessary to evaluate its long-term efficacy and safety when used as a monotherapy or in fixed-dose combinations (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019; 2021).

From a biochemical perspective, the ability of Netarsudil to interfere with TGF-β2–induced extracellular matrix deposition in trabecular meshwork cells offers an additional angle of therapeutic relevance. This property not only supports the reduction in aqueous outflow resistance but may also prove beneficial in preventing or reversing structural remodeling in the TM that is seen in chronic glaucoma (Lin et al., 2018; Sturdivant et al., 2016). Its synthetic origin and structure-activity relationship optimization have resulted in a compound with high potency (with Ki values in the sub-nanomolar range for ROCK isoforms) and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, which further adds to its attractiveness as a drug candidate for long-term management of glaucoma (Lin et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2023).

Overall, my evaluation is that Netarsudil is a highly promising drug candidate for treating glaucoma. Its strengths lie in its dual mechanism of action that targets both the mechanical outflow pathway and the neurohumoral regulation of aqueous humor production. The wealth of preclinical data, combined with extensive supportive clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approval, present a compelling case for its use in patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. While adverse effects such as conjunctival hyperemia must be managed, and additional studies could fine-tune its clinical application, the overall translational readiness, efficacy profile, and mechanistic rationale make Netarsudil an excellent candidate for continued use and further investigation in glaucoma therapy (Dasso et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018; Singh & Singh, 2023; Sturdivant et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2023).

Y-27632 (Sigma-Aldrich cat. Y0503).,"Proposal for Y-27632 (Sigma-Aldrich cat. Y0503).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Y-27632 is a synthetic small molecule that was originally developed as a selective inhibitor of Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCKs), specifically ROCK1 and ROCK2. Synthesized and commercially available from suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich (cat. Y0503), this compound belongs to a well‐established class of ROCK inhibitors that have garnered significant attention for their ability to modulate cell contractility by interfering with the Rho/ROCK signaling cascade. ROCK inhibitors, including Y-27632, were initially identified during biochemical screening efforts designed to elucidate agents that could alter actomyosin contractility through modulation of intracellular signaling pathways. As such, these inhibitors have been widely exploited as pharmacological tools in cell biology to study cytoskeletal dynamics, cell adhesion, and motility. Their application extends from in vitro collagen gel contraction assays to investigations in vascular smooth muscle cells, wherein the inhibition of ROCK activity leads to a reduction in contraction and a consequent relaxation of tissues. Importantly, the discovery of Y-27632 has laid foundational groundwork for understanding the molecular mechanisms governing cellular stiffness and contractility, particularly in tissues such as the trabecular meshwork (TM) of the eye, where abnormal contraction is implicated in elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma pathology (Hirata et al., 2008; Kaneko et al., 2016).

ROCK inhibitors have been used broadly in both preclinical research and, more recently, in clinical settings across cardiovascular, neurological, and ophthalmological applications. The class of compounds has proven instrumental in dissecting cellular processes that rely on actomyosin interactions and in developing therapeutic strategies based on tissue relaxation. Their prior uses in models of vasospasm, wound healing, and ocular tissue remodeling highlight their versatility. In glaucoma research, the TM is a critical site for aqueous humor outflow, and its dysfunction—manifested by increased stiffness and abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition—is a central contributor to disease progression. The ability of Y-27632 to improve TM cell function by reducing contractile tone and modulating ECM composition positions it as a promising candidate for repurposing in glaucoma treatment (Hirata et al., 2008; Kaneko et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Y-27632 has a robust preclinical therapeutic history that spans several fields. In cardiovascular research, ROCK inhibitors have been employed to induce vasodilation through the inhibition of smooth muscle contraction, thereby reducing blood pressure and mitigating vascular dysfunction. In ophthalmology, Y-27632 has been extensively studied in animal models and ex vivo systems to evaluate its impact on the TM, which is the primary resistance site for aqueous humor outflow. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated that Y-27632 reduces contractility in TM cells, leading to a softening of the meshwork and an increase in outflow facility. For instance, ex vivo experiments utilizing human organ-cultured anterior segments (HOCAS) have shown that treatment with Y-27632 results in a dose-dependent enhancement in aqueous humor drainage, a finding directly relevant to the treatment of glaucoma (Liu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2013).

Furthermore, Y-27632 has been deployed in models of retinal ischemia where its neuroprotective potential has been examined. Intravitreal administration in animal studies has demonstrated that Y-27632 attenuates retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death following transient retinal ischemia, suggesting that beyond its IOP-lowering effects, the compound may also confer direct neuroprotection. Such studies have established that ROCK inhibition can reduce inflammatory cell recruitment and improve vascular integrity, thereby protecting the neural retina from ischemic insult (Hirata et al., 2008).

In addition, Y-27632 has been utilized in models of wound healing and fibrosis. Studies in corneal epithelial cells and fibroblasts have shown that Y-27632 can promote cell proliferation and enhance wound closure without inducing apoptosis (Okumura et al., 2015). Despite its extensive use in these preclinical paradigms, searches in clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) indicate that Y-27632 itself has not been formally advanced into clinical trials for glaucoma. Nonetheless, its mechanistic and pharmacological profile as established in preclinical studies has paved the way for the development and clinical approval of newer ROCK inhibitors such as netarsudil and ripasudil, which have demonstrated IOP-lowering efficacy in human subjects (Ashwinbalaji et al., 2018; Kaneko et al., 2016).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Y-27632 exerts its pharmacological effects by competitively inhibiting the ATP-binding site of ROCK1 and ROCK2. Under normal physiological conditions, the Rho/ROCK pathway is activated when RhoA is in its GTP-bound state. Activated ROCK phosphorylates multiple downstream substrates, most notably the myosin light chain (MLC), which plays a crucial role in actomyosin-based contraction. The phosphorylation of MLC increases its interaction with myosin, thereby enhancing contractile force. In the trabecular meshwork, this leads to cellular contraction, increased stiffness, and a reduction in the permeability of the outflow pathway, ultimately contributing to an elevation in IOP (Wang et al., 2013).

Y-27632 binds to ROCK and prevents it from phosphorylating MLC and other substrates such as the myosin binding subunit (MYPT1) of myosin light chain phosphatase. This inhibition results in a decrease in MLC phosphorylation, which in turn reduces actomyosin contractility. The ensuing relaxation of TM cells leads to a ""softening"" of the extracellular matrix and an increase in aqueous humor outflow facility (Kaneko et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2013). Additionally, treatment with Y-27632 results in noticeable morphological changes in TM cells, including cell retraction and rounding, accompanied by a reduction in the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes (Kaneko et al., 2016).

Beyond these anti-contractile effects, Y-27632 has significant anti-fibrotic actions. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) is known to exacerbate TM stiffness by promoting the upregulation of ECM proteins, including fibronectin, collagen type I, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Y-27632 interferes with the TGF-β signaling cascade, thereby reducing the expression of these fibrotic markers. This action helps maintain TM homeostasis and confers a protective effect against the progressive ECM remodeling that contributes to outflow resistance in glaucoma (Liu et al., 2024; Montecchi-Palmer et al., 2017).

Furthermore, ROCK inhibition by Y-27632 appears to enhance the phagocytic activity of TM cells. An increase in phagocytosis is critical for clearing cellular debris in the outflow pathway, thereby preserving the permeability of the TM and preventing the buildup of occlusive material that could further elevate IOP (Wang et al., 2023). There is also evidence indicating that by reducing MLC phosphorylation, Y-27632 may promote a neuroprotective environment in the retina, potentially by improving ocular blood flow and reducing ischemic stress on retinal ganglion cells (Hirata et al., 2008).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the repurposing of Y-27632 for glaucoma treatment is that its inhibition of ROCK1/2 will lead to a significant reduction in trabecular meshwork cell contractility. Laboratory assays, such as collagen gel contraction experiments, consistently show that Y-27632 markedly decreases TM cell-mediated collagen gel contraction, indicative of its ability to reduce cell contractile forces (Ashwinbalaji et al., 2018). This anti-contractile effect is presumed to “soften” the trabecular meshwork, thereby enhancing aqueous humor outflow through the conventional drainage pathway and ultimately lowering intraocular pressure (Wang et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2023).

In vitro studies have demonstrated that when TM cells are treated with Y-27632, there is a pronounced reduction in the phosphorylation of MLC, leading to relaxation of actin stress fibers and decreased formation of focal adhesions. This cellular relaxation is accompanied by a decrease in the expression of ECM components that contribute to TM stiffness. Ex vivo studies using human anterior segment perfusion models have further validated these findings by showing that ROCK inhibitors, including Y-27632, increase outflow facility in a dose-dependent manner (Ashwinbalaji et al., 2018). Consequently, the expected net effect in the glaucomatous eye would be a lowering of IOP—a critical therapeutic goal in managing glaucoma.

Beyond its impact on the outflow pathway, Y-27632 is also anticipated to provide neuroprotective benefits. Preclinical data suggest that ROCK inhibitors can improve local ocular blood flow and reduce retinal ganglion cell apoptosis following ischemic insults, which is particularly relevant given that glaucomatous damage involves not only elevated IOP but also optic nerve degeneration (Hirata et al., 2008).

In summary, the expected effects of Y-27632 in glaucoma treatment are multifold:
1. A reduction in TM cell contractility through decreased MLC phosphorylation, resulting in a “softer” and more compliant outflow pathway.
2. A decrease in ECM deposition and fibrotic marker expression within the TM, counteracting TGF-β-driven pathological remodeling.
3. An enhancement in the phagocytic capacity of TM cells, promoting the clearance of debris and maintenance of outflow facility.
4. Secondary neuroprotective effects via improved ocular blood flow and reduction of ischemia-induced retinal ganglion cell death (Ashwinbalaji et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
The comprehensive preclinical evidence positions Y-27632 as a very promising candidate for repurposing in glaucoma therapy. One of the major strengths of this compound is its well-characterized mechanism of action—by selectively inhibiting ROCK1/2, Y-27632 effectively reduces the phosphorylation of MLC, thereby decreasing actomyosin contractility in TM cells. This mechanism not only leads to a direct reduction in TM stiffness but also facilitates better aqueous humor outflow, which is essential for lowering intraocular pressure, the primary modifiable risk factor in glaucoma (Wang et al., 2013; Kaneko et al., 2016).

Furthermore, Y-27632 has consistently demonstrated favorable tolerability in ocular tissues as evidenced by in vitro and ex vivo studies. Its lack of cytotoxicity and capacity to promote beneficial cellular changes—such as reduced fibrosis and enhanced phagocytosis—underscore its potential for safe long-term ocular use. In addition, the dual benefits afforded by Y-27632, namely, the direct mechanical effects on TM cells and the neuroprotective effects on retinal ganglion cells via improved ocular perfusion, offer a holistic therapeutic approach to glaucoma management. This multifaceted activity is particularly advantageous given that glaucoma is a multifactorial disease involving both mechanical and neurodegenerative components (Hirata et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2013).

Nevertheless, several potential weaknesses must be acknowledged. Despite compelling preclinical data, Y-27632 has not yet been evaluated in clinical trials for glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This lack of human data poses challenges in predicting its clinical efficacy, optimal dosing, and long-term safety profile in patients. Moreover, comparative studies have indicated that while Y-27632 is effective in reducing TM cell contractility, newer ROCK inhibitors such as netarsudil and ripasudil—both of which have advanced through clinical development—may exhibit higher potency or more favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. This relative potency issue may require the development of advanced drug delivery systems (for example, sustained-release formulations or targeted ocular delivery via nanotechnology) to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the target tissues without systemic exposure (Kaneko et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2023).

Another concern is the potential for off-target effects given the ubiquity of the ROCK pathway in various tissues. Although Y-27632 appears to be well tolerated in ocular preclinical models, systemic absorption and inadvertent inhibition of ROCK in other organ systems may lead to unintended consequences (Wang et al., 2023). For instance, vascular tissues are also sensitive to ROCK inhibition, and care must be taken to ensure that therapeutic administration remains confined to the ocular compartment.

Additionally, the complex pathophysiology of glaucoma—which not only involves elevated IOP but also neuroinflammatory and vascular components—requires that any therapeutic intervention address multiple aspects of the disease process. While Y-27632’s dual action on TM relaxation and neuroprotection is promising, comprehensive clinical evaluation will be essential to determine whether these effects translate into meaningful clinical benefits when compared with existing therapies.

Despite these concerns, Y-27632 serves as an excellent proof-of-concept molecule that has significantly advanced our understanding of the Rho/ROCK pathway’s role in ocular physiology and pathology. Its extensive use as a research tool has provided critical insights that have, in turn, informed the development of more advanced ROCK inhibitors now in clinical use. The breadth of preclinical evidence—from in vitro collagen gel contraction assays showing reduced TM contractility (Ashwinbalaji et al., 2018) to ex vivo studies demonstrating enhanced aqueous humor outflow (Ashwinbalaji et al., 2018) and in vivo models indicating potential neuroprotective benefits (Hirata et al., 2008)—collectively support the therapeutic potential of Y-27632 in glaucoma.

In conclusion, Y-27632 is a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in glaucoma management. Its mechanism of inhibiting ROCK1/2 leads to decreased phosphorylation of myosin light chain, thereby reducing TM cell contractility and softening the outflow pathway. This action is expected to increase aqueous humor drainage and produce a clinically significant reduction in IOP. In addition, its potential to protect retinal ganglion cells through improved ocular perfusion offers an added advantage in combating glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Although the current evidence is overwhelmingly preclinical, and Y-27632 itself has yet to enter clinical trials for glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), its well-documented pharmacological profile, favorable safety characteristics in ocular tissues, and robust mechanistic rationale provide a compelling argument for further development. Future research must focus on designing early-phase clinical trials to establish optimal dosing regimens and to compare its efficacy with that of newer ROCK inhibitors, as well as on developing innovative drug delivery systems to maximize its therapeutic index while minimizing systemic exposure (Liu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2013).

Overall, based on the extensive preclinical biochemical, cellular, and functional evidence available from a variety of studies, Y-27632 offers significant promise as a repurposed agent for glaucoma. It capitalizes on the central role of ROCK in regulating TM cell contractility and ECM remodeling—a key pathological mechanism in glaucomatous IOP elevation—and provides the additional potential benefit of neuroprotection. These findings warrant comprehensive clinical evaluation of Y-27632, with a focus on optimally delivering the drug to the TM and achieving sustained IOP reduction without systemic side effects (Ashwinbalaji et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Wang et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2023).

"Ripasudil (K-115), a rho kinase inhibitor approved for glaucoma in Japan.","Proposal for Ripasudil (K-115), a rho kinase inhibitor approved for glaucoma in Japan.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Ripasudil (K-115) is a small‐molecule synthetic compound belonging to the class of Rho‐associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitors. It was discovered and developed by Kowa Company through chemical modifications of earlier compounds such as fasudil, leading to a fluorinated analog that enhances both selectivity and potency against ROCK isoforms. Its synthesis involved the strategic incorporation of functional groups—including a fluorine substituent and a sulphonamide linkage—to target the catalytic domain of ROCK1 and ROCK2 with low nanomolar IC₅₀ values. As a member of the ROCK inhibitor family, ripasudil belongs to a class of compounds originally explored for vascular applications due to their capacity to modulate smooth muscle contraction by affecting actin cytoskeleton dynamics. In ophthalmology, this class has been repurposed to treat conditions in which aqueous humor outflow is compromised, such as glaucoma and ocular hypertension, by directly targeting the trabecular meshwork cells and altering their contractile properties (Garnock‐Jones, 2014; Chang & Wang, 2014).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of ripasudil is distinguished by its use in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma. Initially developed for vascular indications, ROCK inhibitors soon attracted attention when preclinical studies demonstrated their ability to relax trabecular meshwork (TM) cells by reducing actomyosin contraction. Ripasudil has undergone extensive clinical evaluation, culminating in its approval in Japan in 2014 for patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Multiple phase II and phase III clinical trials, such as those reported in clinical studies and post‐marketing observational data, have confirmed its ocular hypotensive efficacy and a favorable safety profile with mainly transient adverse effects like conjunctival hyperemia (Garnock‐Jones, 2014; Tanihara et al., 2015). ROCK inhibitors as a drug class have additionally been evaluated in other ocular conditions, with clinical trials extending their use into applications such as Fuchs endothelial dystrophy, diabetic retinopathy, and corneal endothelial wound healing. Moreover, the growing repository of clinical trial registrations—including those indexed under Clinical Trials Search: Ripasudil OR rho kinase inhibitor glaucoma and specific trial identifiers such as NCT02174991 and NCT06048380—demonstrates ongoing efforts to validate the therapeutic efficacy and broaden the clinical applications of ripasudil in glaucoma management (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
Ripasudil exerts its therapeutic effect by selectively inhibiting the activity of ROCK1 and ROCK2, two serine/threonine kinases that play critical roles in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, contractility, and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization in ocular tissues. Under physiological conditions, activation of ROCK—often downstream of RhoA GTPase—leads to phosphorylation of key substrates such as myosin light chain (MLC) and myosin light chain phosphatase inhibitory proteins, thereby promoting actomyosin contraction. In the trabecular meshwork, this results in increased cell stiffness, enhanced focal adhesions, and greater deposition of fibrotic ECM components such as collagen and fibronectin, all contributing to increased outflow resistance and elevated IOP (Chang & Wang, 2014; Rao, Pattabiraman, & Kopczynski, 2017). By inhibiting ROCK activity, ripasudil decreases MLC phosphorylation, leading to relaxation of the trabecular meshwork cells and reduction in cellular contractility. This relaxation is accompanied by morphological changes including disassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions, which together result in diminished ECM secretion. The net effect is an increased aqueous humor outflow through the conventional drainage pathway (trabecular meshwork and Schlemm’s canal), leading to a reduction in IOP (Pagano et al., 2023; Tanihara et al., 2015). Mechanistic studies in cell culture and animal models have provided direct evidence that ROCK inhibition normalizes outflow facility by counteracting the pathological stiffness of TM cells, confirming the essential role of ROCK‐mediated cytoskeletal dynamics in regulating IOP (Ochoa et al., 2023; Chang & Wang, 2014).

Expected Effect:
In the context of glaucoma, the expected outcome of ripasudil administration is a significant reduction in IOP mediated through normalization of trabecular meshwork function. The proposed assay would involve testing ripasudil on cultured human trabecular meshwork cells where ROCK1 and ROCK2 are endogenously expressed; these proteins have been confirmed as being present in these cells, as evidenced in biochemical studies and expression profiles described in the literature (Rao et al., 2017; Pagano et al., 2023). By inhibiting these kinases, ripasudil is anticipated to reduce actomyosin‐generated contractile tension and decrease ECM protein secretion. In vitro, this would be reflected by reduced stress fiber formation, decreased focal adhesion assembly, and normalization of junctional proteins such as ZO‐1 and cadherin, which are crucial for maintaining cellular barrier properties and tissue architecture. The consequent biological effect is an increased outflow of aqueous humor which, if translated in vivo, manifests clinically as a reduction in IOP (Garnock‐Jones, 2014; Chang & Wang, 2014). Preclinical studies in animal models, particularly in non‐human primates and rabbits, have already demonstrated that topical administration of ripasudil induces a rapid, dose‐dependent decline in IOP, which is congruent with its mechanism of action of decreasing trabecular resistance. Clinically, ripasudil eye drops have been shown to provide significant IOP reduction, with peak effects observed within 1–2 hours post‐dose and sustained efficacy over several hours, thereby aligning with the expectations of improved aqueous humor dynamics (Tanihara et al., 2015; Wang, Wang, & Dang, 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Taking into account the detailed mechanistic insights, established clinical efficacy, and favorable safety profile of ripasudil, this therapeutic candidate has substantial promise for the treatment of glaucoma. The principal strength of ripasudil lies in its mechanistic specificity: by directly targeting ROCK1 and ROCK2, it addresses the fundamental pathophysiology of increased outflow resistance at the trabecular meshwork—an aspect not adequately targeted by many traditional glaucoma therapies that focus predominantly on aqueous production or non‐conventional outflow pathways (Garnock‐Jones, 2014; Chang & Wang, 2014). Its ability to modulate cytoskeletal tension and reduce ECM deposition translates into an additive therapeutic strategy that can be used either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents such as timolol or latanoprost. The clinical validation, evidenced by the approval in Japan and numerous phase II/III trials demonstrating significant IOP reductions, further supports its efficacy. Additionally, the well‐characterized pharmacokinetic profile in ocular tissues—with rapid ocular penetration and an acceptable systemic exposure profile—enhances its appeal as a repurposed candidate, as it builds upon an existing regulatory dossier that streamlines repositioning for additional indications or combinations (Garnock‐Jones, 2014; Tanihara et al., 2015).

Nonetheless, some weaknesses warrant consideration. The most frequently reported adverse event is transient conjunctival hyperemia, which, although generally mild, has been noted across several clinical trials. This side effect may impact patient compliance over long‐term use, especially if used as a standalone therapy. Furthermore, although the mechanism of ROCK inhibition is well‐established in preclinical models, there remains some variability in clinical responses among different subpopulations of glaucoma patients, such as those with secondary or refractory glaucomas, which could influence the generalizability of its efficacy (Freiberg et al., 2022; Pagano et al., 2023). Moreover, while the existing data have predominantly been generated in Japanese populations, additional studies would be beneficial to further characterize its performance in more ethnically diverse cohorts.

Another consideration is the potential for combination therapies; while additive effects have been demonstrated when ripasudil is combined with standard agents (e.g., beta blockers or prostaglandin analogues), the long‐term safety and efficacy of such combinations in routine clinical settings still need further validation in larger, multicenter studies. Nonetheless, ongoing and planned clinical trials, as indexed by various ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers including those for glaucoma and corneal applications (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023), continue to expand our understanding of ROCK inhibitors’ therapeutic window and versatility in ophthalmology.

Overall, the evidence strongly supports ripasudil’s utility in modulating aqueous humor dynamics by acting on the trabecular meshwork. The compound’s established role in reducing IOP through ROCK inhibition, its favorable ocular safety profile, and its potential additive benefits when used alongside conventional glaucoma treatments make it a highly promising candidate for repurposing within the glaucoma therapeutic arena. It addresses a critical unmet need by directly improving outflow facility, thereby reducing the primary risk factor for glaucoma progression—elevated intraocular pressure. In summation, while minor adverse events and potential inter‐individual variability present challenges, the strengths of ripasudil in terms of its mechanistic rationale, clinical experience, and regulatory pedigree provide a strong foundation for its continued and expanded use in the management of glaucoma (Garnock‐Jones, 2014; Tanihara et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2023).

"ISTH0036, a locked nucleic acid–modified antisense oligonucleotide targeting TGF-β2 mRNA.","Proposal for ISTH0036, a locked nucleic acid–modified antisense oligonucleotide targeting TGF-β2 mRNA.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
ISTH0036 is a locked nucleic acid (LNA)–modified antisense oligonucleotide specifically engineered to target the messenger RNA (mRNA) of transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF-β2), a cytokine critically involved in fibrotic remodeling within the eye, particularly in glaucomatous disease states (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). This therapeutic candidate is synthetically produced using advanced oligonucleotide synthesis techniques that incorporate locked nucleic acid modifications within a phosphorothioate backbone, which enhances its binding affinity and nuclease resistance compared to unmodified oligonucleotides (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). As a member of the antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) drug class, ISTH0036 belongs to a group of small, synthetic nucleic acid constructs that have been developed over the past few decades to modulate gene expression by binding to complementary mRNA sequences and blocking translation into protein (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). Historically, the antisense oligonucleotide approach has been applied to various diseases—including genetic disorders, cancers, and viral infections—by providing a means for sequence-specific downregulation of target proteins, and the LNA modification represents an evolution of this technology for enhanced stability, specificity, and tissue retention (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). The origin of this candidate stems from a rational drug design process where TGF-β2 was identified as a pivotal driver of ocular fibrosis and trabecular meshwork (TM) remodeling in glaucoma, and subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that selective knockdown of TGF-β2 mRNA could yield promising antifibrotic effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). The synthetic nature of ISTH0036 also allows for scalable production under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) conditions, making it a viable candidate for clinical development in ocular indications (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017).

Therapeutic History:
The antisense oligonucleotide class has a storied history in both clinical and preclinical research, having been utilized to modulate pathogenic transcripts in conditions ranging from spinal muscular atrophy to cytomegalovirus retinitis, and ISTH0036 represents the latest iteration in this evolving field (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). Specific to ocular diseases, early efforts with antisense compounds aimed at modulating fibrotic gene expression have shown promise in reducing excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, although many earlier candidates suffered from suboptimal pharmacokinetic profiles and limited tissue penetration (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). Prior clinical studies, particularly the Phase I dose-escalation trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015), have investigated ISTH0036 in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma undergoing trabeculectomy, with the rationale that inhibition of TGF-β2 could reduce postsurgical scarring and improve long-term intraocular pressure (IOP) control (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). In those studies, ISTH0036 was administered intravitreally at the time of trabeculectomy in escalating doses ranging from 6.75 μg to 225 μg, revealing favorable ocular safety profiles and trends toward sustained IOP reduction at higher doses (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). From a veterinary perspective, while the primary literature here does not explicitly document prior veterinary applications of ISTH0036, antisense oligonucleotide strategies have been explored in animals to modulate fibrotic processes in various organ systems, suggesting possible cross-species pharmacodynamic relevance (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Altogether, the therapeutic history indicates that ISTH0036 is supported by both preclinical evidence in animal models (including rabbits and primates, which have demonstrated sustained TGF-β2 suppression for up to 8 weeks) and early-phase clinical trials in humans, thereby establishing a credible translational pathway for its use in treating glaucoma-related fibrosis (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, ISTH0036 functions by binding complementarily to a specific sequence within the TGF-β2 mRNA, which facilitates its degradation or steric blockade of translation, thereby preventing the synthesis of the profibrotic TGF-β2 protein (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). The LNA modifications within the oligonucleotide significantly enhance both the affinity for the target mRNA and the stability of the molecule in biological fluids, ensuring prolonged tissue exposure after intravitreal injection (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). This precise targeting results in decreased TGF-β2 protein levels which, in the context of the trabecular meshwork, is anticipated to lead to a reduction in SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and downstream signaling cascades responsible for extracellular matrix deposition (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). Biochemically, TGF-β2 normally exerts its effects by binding to its cell surface receptors and activating receptor-associated SMAD proteins that translocate to the nucleus, where they modulate the expression of genes involved in ECM production as well as contractile protein expression such as alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). By interrupting this cascade through transcript-specific knockdown, ISTH0036 is envisioned to prevent the transformation of trabecular meshwork cells to a more fibrotic and contractile phenotype, which is a hallmark of glaucomatous pathology (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). In addition to impairing the SMAD-dependent pathway, reduced levels of TGF-β2 may also indirectly affect other non-canonical pathways involved in fibrotic and angiogenic processes, thus potentially offering a broader therapeutic benefit by minimizing both ECM accumulation and neovascular complications (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). The molecular interactions of ISTH0036 specifically exemplify the concept of gene silencing via antisense mechanisms, where selective mRNA binding confers high mechanistic specificity with minimal off-target effects relative to ligand or receptor blockade approaches (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017).

Expected Effect:
In the context of glaucoma, particularly where excessive trabecular meshwork fibrosis is a driving force behind increased intraocular pressure, the expected effect of applying ISTH0036 is to reduce TGF-β2 protein production and subsequently inhibit the SMAD2/3 signaling cascade, leading to lower levels of ECM deposition within the TM (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). Topical application or intravitreal delivery of ISTH0036 is hypothesized to yield localized transcript knockdown in trabecular meshwork cells, which typically express high levels of TGF-β2 in glaucomatous eyes, thereby directly addressing one of the key molecular drivers of the disease (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). Reduced TGF-β2 signaling is expected to prevent the phenotypic switch to a contractile state in TM cells, which otherwise contributes to increased outflow resistance through the aqueous humor drainage pathways (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). Preclinical models have demonstrated that a single intravitreal injection of ISTH0036 can result in sustained suppression of TGF-β2 mRNA and protein levels for up to 8 weeks, thereby potentially allowing for repeat dosing strategies that maintain therapeutic levels over clinically relevant time periods (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). The expected outcome in a clinical glaucoma setting would therefore involve not only improved IOP control through enhanced aqueous humor outflow but also a reduction in postoperative scarring for patients undergoing filtration surgery such as trabeculectomy (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). Mechanistic studies have also underscored that TGF-β2 is the predominant isoform driving fibrotic ECM remodeling in the trabecular meshwork, and its suppression has been associated with favorable changes in bleb morphology and surgical success (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). By targeting the source of fibrosis directly at the mRNA level rather than modulating downstream receptor interactions, ISTH0036 offers the promise of durable target engagement with reduced risk of systemic side effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
ISTH0036 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of glaucoma due to its novel mechanism of action, robust preclinical data, and supportive early-phase clinical findings, and its specificity for TGF-β2 mRNA distinguishes it from conventional antifibrotic and IOP-lowering therapies (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). One of the main strengths of ISTH0036 is its capacity to provide targeted gene silencing via LNA modifications, which yield high binding affinity, enhanced nuclease resistance, and prolonged tissue half-life, factors that are critical in maintaining therapeutic levels in the ocular environment (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). The clinical data from the phase I study (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015) indicate that ISTH0036 is safe and well tolerated, with no adverse events attributed to the compound during trabeculectomy procedures, which is a vital consideration for any agent intended for intraocular use (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). Moreover, the dose-dependent trends observed in IOP reduction—particularly at higher dose levels where postoperative IOP was maintained below 10 mmHg—suggest that ISTH0036 is not only mechanistically sound but also potentially efficacious in modulating the key pathological features of glaucoma (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). The hypothesis that topical or intravitreal administration of ISTH0036 will reduce TGF-β2 levels in trabecular meshwork cells, thereby mitigating the downstream SMAD2/3 signaling and ECM deposition, is well supported by previous genetic and functional studies that have established TGF-β2 as a central mediator of glaucomatous changes in the TM (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Additionally, the antisense oligonucleotide strategy offers the advantage of directly reducing the transcript responsible for the synthesis of TGF-β2, rather than interfering with receptor binding or ligand activity, which may translate into more durable and robust clinical outcomes with minimal off-target effects (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017).

However, despite these strengths, several potential challenges must be acknowledged. One concern is the delivery method, as effective penetration and distribution within the trabecular meshwork remain critical hurdles for any ocular therapeutic, although the existing phase I trial data using intravitreal injections are encouraging (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). Additionally, while the preclinical evidence demonstrates sustained mRNA and protein suppression after a single dose in animal models, the translation of these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles into the human eye needs further confirmation through Phase II and III studies, as the ocular microenvironment in humans may present unique barriers not fully recapitulated in animal models (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). There is also the inherent challenge of achieving sufficient knockdown of TGF-β2 without impacting related isoforms or disrupting normal wound-healing processes which, although not detailed in the current data set, represent potential areas of risk that must be monitored in larger-scale trials (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Furthermore, while the antisense mechanism provides high specificity, the long-term effects of repeated dosing on ocular tissues, including potential inflammatory responses or off-target gene silencing, remain to be established over extended treatment periods (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017).

From a strategic development perspective, the potential for repurposing ISTH0036 for glaucoma is highly attractive given its demonstrated efficacy in reducing postoperative IOP in glaucoma filtration surgery, its mechanism directly addresses the underlying pathophysiology of fibrotic TM remodeling, and it circumvents some of the limitations associated with current antifibrotic agents such as mitomycin C (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). The combination of its robust preclinical data—including favorable pharmacodynamic activity in rabbit and primate models—and promising phase I safety and efficacy observations provides a compelling rationale for advancing ISTH0036 into further clinical development for glaucoma (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015).

Overall, ISTH0036 is a uniquely engineered antisense therapeutic with significant potential for glaucoma treatment, particularly in cases where fibrotic remodeling of the trabecular meshwork leads to elevated intraocular pressure. Its highly specific mechanism of action, coupled with encouraging early-phase clinical data demonstrating both safety and potential efficacy, strongly supports further clinical development (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). Among the strengths of this candidate are its LNA-modified design that confers enhanced stability and tissue half-life, the direct targeting of TGF-β2 mRNA to abrogate downstream fibrotic signaling (including SMAD2/3-mediated ECM deposition), and its ability to potentially complement existing glaucoma treatments by providing a mechanism-based intervention that focuses on disease modification rather than solely on IOP reduction (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015).

Nevertheless, future studies must address several key issues: ensuring optimized delivery to the trabecular meshwork via ophthalmic formulations (whether through topical administration or via intravitreal injections), defining the long-term safety profile and potential cumulative toxicity of repeated dosing, and establishing clear efficacy endpoints in well-powered Phase II and III trials that not only assess IOP reduction but also evaluate structural and functional improvements in the optic nerve and retinal ganglion cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017). Additionally, given the heterogeneous nature of glaucoma, patient stratification based on TGF-β2 biomarker levels may further enhance the therapeutic index of ISTH0036 and enable personalized treatment regimens that maximize clinical benefit while minimizing adverse effects (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017).

In conclusion, given the substantial body of evidence supporting the pathogenic role of TGF-β2 in glaucomatous trabecular meshwork fibrosis and ECM remodeling, ISTH0036 emerges as a promising candidate for targeted molecular intervention in glaucoma (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Its novel antisense mechanism, combined with favorable preclinical and early clinical outcomes, positions ISTH0036 as a strong contender for repurposing in the treatment of glaucoma, especially considering the limitations of current therapies that primarily focus on lowering IOP without addressing the underlying molecular drivers of disease progression (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). While additional studies are warranted to fully characterize its pharmacokinetic profile, dosing strategy, and long-term safety, the existing literature and clinical data provide a robust scientific foundation for advancing ISTH0036 into subsequent phases of clinical development for glaucoma (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017).

Overall, the strengths of ISTH0036 include its high target specificity, innovative antisense mechanism, durability of effect owing to a long tissue half-life, and its demonstrated potential to reduce postoperative fibrosis and lower IOP, which is critical in improving outcomes in glaucoma filtration surgeries (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Its development is further supported by rigorous preclinical studies in animal models and promising Phase I clinical safety data in humans (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). The primary weaknesses or challenges involve optimizing its delivery method to ensure adequate tissue penetration, understanding the long-term implications of sustained TGF-β2 knockdown in ocular tissues, and validating that the preclinical efficacy translates to a meaningful clinical benefit in a larger and more diverse patient population (Pfeiffer & Renieri, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015).

Given these considerations, ISTH0036 holds significant promise as a repurposed drug candidate for glaucoma, particularly in patients with advanced disease where fibrosis contributes substantially to the disease burden, and it merits continued investigation with a view toward initiating Phase II trials that rigorously assess both clinical efficacy and long-term safety outcomes (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). The innovative approach of direct transcript knockdown in the glaucomatous trabecular meshwork provides a compelling alternative to current strategies, potentially paving the way for a new class of molecular therapeutics in the management of glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015).

"Fasudil (HA-1077), a rho kinase inhibitor.","Proposal for Fasudil (HA-1077), a rho kinase inhibitor.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fasudil (also known as HA-1077) is a small‐molecule inhibitor of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) that was initially discovered as a vasodilator agent for use in cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. It belongs to the isoquinoline sulfonamide class of compounds, and its molecular structure comprises an isoquinoline core linked to a sulfonamide moiety. Fasudil was synthesized through a series of organic reactions aimed at introducing the sulfonyl group onto the isoquinoline nucleus, a modification that confers its inhibitory activity on the ATP-binding site of ROCK enzymes. This compound, along with others in its class, has traditionally been employed for cardiovascular applications, primarily via its ability to relax vascular smooth muscle through inhibition of ROCK-dependent signaling pathways. Its history of use in vascular and neurological settings is supported by extensive pharmacological research and a well-established safety profile in these indications, thereby making Fasudil an attractive candidate for repurposing in ocular diseases such as glaucoma (Chang & Wang, 2014; Cholkar et al., 2015).

Therapeutic History:
Fasudil has a long-standing therapeutic history in treating cardiovascular conditions in Japan and China, particularly for cerebral vasospasm, where it is approved and used clinically to ensure improved cerebral blood flow following ischemic events. Its mechanism of inducing smooth muscle relaxation through the inhibition of ROCK has been well characterized in this context, lending credence to its potential benefits in other tissues characterized by contractile properties. Notably, preclinical investigations have demonstrated that the biochemical actions of Fasudil translate into effective modulation of cell contractility in various tissues, including ocular tissues such as the trabecular meshwork. Although clinical trials specifically addressing Fasudil in glaucoma or ocular hypertension are lacking—as indicated by searches on ClinicalTrials.gov—the extensive preclinical data and biochemical rationale suggest that Fasudil’s utility may extend into ophthalmology by leveraging its well-documented ROCK inhibitor activity (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chang & Wang, 2014). In animal models, other ROCK inhibitors have been successfully used to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) by enhancing aqueous humor outflow, and Fasudil has been shown in similar in vitro settings to attenuate trabecular meshwork (TM) cell contraction in collagen gel assays, providing an encouraging basis for its further evaluation as a glaucoma therapeutic agent (Chang & Wang, 2014; Cholkar et al., 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
Fasudil exerts its pharmacological effect primarily by competitively inhibiting the activity of Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCK1 and ROCK2), which are serine/threonine kinases pivotal in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. At the molecular level, ROCKs regulate cellular contractility through the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) as well as through inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase. Fasudil binds to the ATP-binding pocket of the ROCK enzyme, thereby inhibiting the kinase’s ability to phosphorylate MLC. This blockade results in a reduction in actomyosin contraction within cells, leading to relaxation of tissues that rely on actin-myosin interactions for contractile properties. In the context of the trabecular meshwork of the eye, ROCK expression is confirmed, and its activity is directly linked to the resistance against aqueous humor outflow. By inhibiting ROCK, Fasudil is expected to diminish stress fiber formation and extracellular matrix (ECM) contractility in TM cells, which, in turn, facilitates the expansion of intercellular spaces and improves aqueous outflow, ultimately contributing to a reduction in intraocular pressure (Chang & Wang, 2014; Chatzimichail et al., 2025).
Besides its effect on the contractile apparatus, Fasudil may also modulate the assembly of focal adhesions and influence cell shape and motility through its impact on the actin cytoskeleton. This modulation is essential in maintaining the biomechanical properties of the trabecular meshwork, as increased rigidity in the tissue plays a major role in glaucomatous pathology. The biochemical interactions of Fasudil involve the disruption of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway, which has been implicated in the pathological stiffening of the TM and subsequent failure of conventional aqueous humor drainage (Chang & Wang, 2014; Chatzimichail et al., 2025). Additionally, ROCK inhibitors have been shown to exert beneficial neurovascular and neuroprotective effects in animal models, which further enhances the rationale for their use in diseases such as glaucoma where optic nerve health is of paramount importance (Chang & Wang, 2014; Ismaiel et al., 2017).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, the expected therapeutic effect of Fasudil in glaucoma is to lower intraocular pressure by enhancing the outflow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork. The compound is anticipated to block ROCK-dependent myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation in TM cells, a process that normally promotes stress fiber formation and contributes to cellular contractility and ECM rigidity. By attenuating these processes, Fasudil should effectively reduce the mechanical resistance to aqueous humor outflow, resulting in improved drainage and thus a decrease in IOP. In vitro studies have shown that Fasudil can induce relaxation of TM cells, and similar effects have been observed with other ROCK inhibitors that increase the conventional outflow facility in animal models (Chang & Wang, 2014; Wang et al., 2023).
Moreover, the ROCK pathway plays a role not only in cellular contractility but also in fibrotic processes, including postoperative scarring seen after glaucoma filtration surgery. By inhibiting ROCK activity, Fasudil may also exert antifibrotic effects which would be beneficial in improving surgical outcomes by mitigating scar formation and preserving the functionality of surgical blebs (Chang & Wang, 2014; Chatzimichail et al., 2025). This multifaceted mechanism is particularly valuable in addressing both the intraocular pressure component and the neuroprotective needs of glaucoma management. Given that the trabecular meshwork expresses significant levels of ROCK isoforms, Fasudil’s direct action on these cells is expected to result in a robust enhancement of aqueous outflow and a measurable drop in IOP, which has been a predictive outcome in various preclinical studies employing topical or systemic ROCK inhibitors (Chang & Wang, 2014; Ismaiel et al., 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
Fasudil emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for glaucoma based on its well-documented pharmacological profile and its established safety record in non-ocular indications such as cerebral vasospasm and cardiovascular disorders. One of the primary strengths of Fasudil is its clear mechanism of action; by inhibiting ROCK, it directly impacts the cytoskeletal dynamics of trabecular meshwork cells, leading to reduced cellular contractility and enhanced aqueous humor outflow. This effect addresses the fundamental pathophysiological mechanism underlying elevated intraocular pressure in glaucoma (Chang & Wang, 2014; Cholkar et al., 2015). The compound’s chemical structure and mode of inhibition have been extensively studied, and its interaction with the ATP-binding site of ROCK is well characterized, which supports a robust biochemical rationale for its repurposing in glaucoma treatment (Chang & Wang, 2014; Cholkar et al., 2015).
Furthermore, Fasudil’s relatively favorable systemic pharmacokinetic profile and its demonstrated tolerability in cardiovascular applications add to its appeal as a repurposed drug candidate. Although there is no current registered clinical trial for Fasudil in glaucoma patients—highlighted by recent queries on ClinicalTrials.gov—the preclinical and biochemical data from other ROCK inhibitors such as ripasudil and netarsudil provide substantial indirect evidence for the potential efficacy of Fasudil in an ocular context (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chang & Wang, 2014).
The expected benefits of Fasudil in glaucoma include not only an IOP-lowering effect through its action on trabecular meshwork cells but also the potential for neuroprotection and improved ocular blood flow, which are critical for preventing or slowing optic nerve damage. This dual action, targeting both the mechanical and the neurodegenerative components of glaucoma, represents a significant advantage over traditional therapies that focus solely on reducing aqueous humor production or enhancing uveoscleral outflow (Chang & Wang, 2014; Wang et al., 2023).
However, several challenges remain. Despite its established use in other pathologies, Fasudil has not yet been rigorously evaluated in large-scale clinical trials for glaucoma, and its ocular pharmacokinetics, particularly with respect to achieving effective concentrations in the trabecular meshwork after topical administration, require further investigation. Additionally, while the adverse effects observed with other ROCK inhibitors are generally mild and transient (for example, conjunctival hyperemia), the safety and tolerability profile of Fasudil in the ocular setting must be established through comprehensive clinical studies (Chang & Wang, 2014; Chatzimichail et al., 2025). There is also a need to optimize delivery methods—such as sustained-release formulations via PLGA microspheres or advanced liposomal carriers—to ensure adequate bioavailability and minimize off-target systemic exposure (Wang et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2020).
In summary, Fasudil represents a strong candidate for repurposing in glaucoma due to its well-defined mechanism of action, preclinical evidence supporting improved aqueous humor outflow, and a safety profile established in other therapeutic areas. Its ability to decrease ROCK-mediated MLC phosphorylation in trabecular meshwork cells addresses a key pathogenic mechanism in glaucoma, and its additional potential for neuroprotective effects reinforces its suitability as a multifaceted therapeutic agent. Nevertheless, further detailed pharmacokinetic studies and clinical trials are imperative to validate its efficacy, establish optimal dosing regimens, and fully characterize its safety in the ocular environment. These additional studies would determine whether the promising preclinical data can be successfully translated into a viable treatment option for patients with glaucoma (Chang & Wang, 2014; Chatzimichail et al., 2025; Ismaiel et al., 2017).

Overall, the strengths of Fasudil include its potent ROCK inhibitory activity with a clear mechanism that directly targets the trabecular meshwork’s contractile apparatus, an established clinical safety record in systemic applications, and promising preclinical evidence suggesting that ROCK inhibition can effectively lower intraocular pressure. The weaknesses center on the currently limited direct clinical evidence for its use in glaucoma, potential challenges in ocular drug delivery that need to be addressed through formulation innovations, and the need for rigorous evaluation of its ocular safety profile. Despite these challenges, the body of biochemical and preclinical literature provides a strong rationale for the continued investigation of Fasudil as a repurposing candidate for glaucoma treatment. Further research in this area could position Fasudil not only as an alternative treatment option for patients with ocular hypertension but also as part of a multifaceted therapeutic strategy aimed at both lowering IOP and protecting the optic nerve in glaucoma (Chang & Wang, 2014; Chatzimichail et al., 2025; Ismaiel et al., 2017).

Rapamycin (Sirolimus).,"Proposal for Rapamycin (Sirolimus).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rapamycin, also known as sirolimus, is a naturally derived macrolide antibiotic originally isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Chemically, it belongs to the macrolide family and is characterized by its large lactone ring and high molecular weight, conferring it the ability to inhibit key cellular signaling pathways. It is synthesized through fermentation processes utilizing strains of Streptomyces and subsequently purified, and it has become paradigmatic as an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). As a representative of this class, rapamycin has been used extensively in the clinical management of organ transplant rejection due to its immunosuppressive properties, and it is also known for its anti-proliferative and anti-fibrotic activities in various cell types. Its extensive characterization in multiple systems has led to its repurposing in diverse therapeutic contexts in addition to its original indication (Unknown Reference, 2011).

Therapeutic History:
Rapamycin has a long therapeutic history across several fields. It is used extensively in transplant medicine as an immunosuppressant, where its main application is the prevention of organ rejection by inhibiting T-cell proliferation. Over the years, extensive preclinical work has demonstrated its anti-fibrotic properties, notably in models of pulmonary, renal, and cardiac fibrosis. In the ocular field, rapamycin has been evaluated in several preclinical and early clinical studies for applications in inflammatory conditions such as non-infectious uveitis and diabetic macular edema. Clinical trials such as those registered under NCT01517074 and NCT01675947 have investigated the safety and ocular pharmacokinetics of sirolimus administered via subconjunctival and intravitreal injections, respectively, primarily for ocular inflammatory diseases rather than glaucoma directly. Nevertheless, these studies provide a sound foundation regarding the drug’s local tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile, aspects that are highly relevant for its potential repurposing in glaucoma. Importantly, preclinical animal studies, including those involving rabbit glaucoma filtration surgery models, have shown that sustained-release formulations of sirolimus, such as the PLGA-based film, can prevent fibroblast proliferation and scar formation, with no significant ocular toxicity observed (Unknown Reference, 2011; Manzano et al., 2009). While rapamycin has not been directly indicated for glaucoma in published pivotal clinical trials, the extensive literature on its anti-fibrotic and immunomodulatory properties in ocular tissues underscores its potential utility in conditions characterized by extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and fibrosis, such as glaucomatous trabecular meshwork dysfunction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
Rapamycin exerts its pharmacological effects primarily through inhibition of the mTOR complex, specifically mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). At the molecular level, rapamycin forms a complex with the intracellular receptor FKBP-12, and this complex binds to mTORC1, inhibiting its kinase activity. Through mTORC1 inhibition, rapamycin blocks downstream phosphorylation events on key regulatory proteins such as p70S6 kinase and 4E-binding protein 1, which are essential for protein synthesis, cell growth, and proliferation. In the context of fibrosis, mTOR activation has been implicated in fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis. This is especially relevant for trabecular meshwork (TM) fibroblasts, where mTOR signaling cross-talks with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathways. TGF-β is a potent pro-fibrotic cytokine that drives fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation, upregulation of collagen synthesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling. By inhibiting mTORC1, rapamycin can disrupt this cross talk, thereby reducing TGF-β–mediated fibroblast proliferation and collagen production. This anti-fibrotic mechanism has been demonstrated in preclinical models in which rapamycin, delivered via sustained-release films or hydrogels, significantly reduced markers of fibroblast proliferation such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and increased apoptosis of fibroblasts in the surgical wound, potentially through cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase (Unknown Reference, 2011). Additionally, rapamycin-induced mTOR inhibition leads to enhanced autophagy, a cellular process beneficial in clearing damaged proteins and organelles, which is particularly protective for trabecular meshwork cells under stress, for example in glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma models (Zhu et al., 2020). Moreover, rapamycin’s regulation of mitochondrial quality control and its effects on the NF-kappa B signaling pathway further contribute to its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory profile, which is relevant in the context of glaucomatous neurodegeneration (Su et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
For the proposed hypothesis in glaucoma, the expectation is that rapamycin will inhibit mTORC1 in trabecular meshwork fibroblasts, thereby mitigating TGF-β–stimulated fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis. The anticipated downstream effect is an attenuation of extracellular matrix remodeling within the trabecular meshwork. Such remodeling—if left unchecked—can lead to increased outflow resistance, a critical factor in the development of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that when fibroblast proliferation is curtailed through mTOR inhibition, there is a corresponding reduction in markers such as collagen deposition and PCNA expression. This preservation of trabecular meshwork architecture is expected to improve aqueous humor outflow, potentially lowering IOP and slowing glaucomatous progression (Unknown Reference, 2011). Furthermore, in glaucoma animal models, rapamycin has been shown to induce autophagy in trabecular meshwork cells and protect these cells from glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby preserving cellular function and contributing to the maintenance of normal intraocular pressure (Zhu et al., 2020). The expected biochemical outcome is a decrease in TGF-β–induced extracellular matrix components such as collagen types and fibronectin in the trabecular meshwork, as well as a stabilization of cellular homeostasis through enhanced autophagic flux. These effects have been observed in vitro and in animal models and are promising indicators that rapamycin may be effective in improving outflow facility and preventing or delaying the onset of glaucomatous damage (Lee et al., 2019; Li et al., 2018).

Overall Evaluation:
In our comprehensive evaluation of rapamycin as a therapeutic candidate for glaucoma, several strengths and challenges emerge. Among the major strengths, rapamycin’s well-characterized mechanism of action through mTOR inhibition offers a clear molecular rationale for its anti-fibrotic effects in trabecular meshwork fibroblasts. The cross talk between mTOR and TGF-β signaling is a pivotal pathway in fibrosis, and preclinical models have repeatedly shown that rapamycin can reduce fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, two key drivers of extracellular matrix remodeling that contribute to increased outflow resistance and intraocular pressure elevation (Unknown Reference, 2011; Zhu et al., 2020). Moreover, rapamycin has an extensive therapeutic history, with established immunosuppressive, anti-proliferative, and anti-fibrotic properties across multiple organ systems. Its previous use in ocular indications such as non-infectious uveitis and diabetic macular edema provides valuable preliminary evidence regarding its topical ocular safety and pharmacokinetic profile, which strongly supports its repurposing for glaucoma (Nguyen et al., 2013; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, innovative drug delivery systems, such as the sustained-release PLGA films and injectable hydrogels that have been tested in rabbit models of glaucoma filtration surgery, have shown promising results in maintaining therapeutic drug levels in ocular tissues, indicating that the formulation challenges associated with rapamycin’s poor aqueous solubility can be overcome (Unknown Reference, 2011; Sun et al., 2025).

Despite these promising attributes, several challenges remain. First, while preclinical animal studies and early-phase clinical trials in other ophthalmic diseases have demonstrated favorable outcomes regarding safety and anti-fibrotic effects, there is currently a lack of direct clinical trial data for rapamycin’s efficacy in treating glaucoma specifically. The majority of existing clinical studies have focused on inflammatory and neovascular conditions rather than directly addressing trabecular meshwork remodeling or intraocular pressure reduction. Secondly, the pharmacokinetic challenges inherent in delivering rapamycin effectively to the trabecular meshwork must be considered. Although advanced drug delivery systems have been developed, the translational gap between preclinical models and human efficacy remains a critical step. Finally, while the anti-fibrotic and immunosuppressive actions of rapamycin are well-documented, long-term safety data in the context of ocular use, particularly with chronic administration for a condition like glaucoma that requires prolonged treatment, still need to be established.

In conclusion, the cumulative evidence supports the therapeutic potential of rapamycin for glaucoma through its inhibition of mTORC1, interference with TGF-β–mediated fibroblast proliferation, and consequent reduction in pathological extracellular matrix remodeling in the trabecular meshwork. The strong mechanistic rationale, bolstered by robust preclinical findings and a favorable safety profile in related ocular studies, points to rapamycin as a promising candidate for repurposing in glaucoma treatment (Unknown Reference, 2011; Zhu et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Li et al., 2018). Nevertheless, further research including focused clinical trials specifically addressing glaucoma endpoints, detailed ocular pharmacokinetics, and long-term safety assessments is required before definitive conclusions can be reached regarding its clinical efficacy in this context. Thus, while challenges exist, rapamycin’s well-characterized biochemical actions and its demonstrable anti-fibrotic effects provide a compelling case for its continued evaluation as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma.

Verteporfin.,"Proposal for Verteporfin.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Verteporfin is a benzoporphyrin derivative originally developed as a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in ocular diseases such as choroidal neovascularization associated with age‐related macular degeneration. As a member of the porphyrin class of compounds, verteporfin was discovered when researchers sought to develop agents capable of accumulating selectively in neovascular tissues and, upon activation with nonthermal red light, generating reactive oxygen species that damage the abnormal vasculature. Its synthetic origins involve modifications of the porphyrin ring to enhance its photophysical properties while ensuring preferential tissue uptake. Over time, subsequent investigations revealed that, independent of light activation, verteporfin exhibits off‐target inhibitory effects on key transcriptional coactivators, specifically Yes‐associated protein (YAP) and its paralog TAZ. This repositioning from a photosensitizer to a potential anti‐fibrotic agent is based on its ability to disrupt the YAP–TEAD (TEA domain) protein–protein interaction, thereby attenuating downstream gene transcription associated with cellular proliferation and fibrosis (Frömmichen et al., 2025; Sun et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Clinically, verteporfin has an established history in ophthalmology, being approved by the FDA for use in PDT to treat choroidal neovascularization in age‐related macular degeneration. Its use in this context is backed by decades of clinical experience that document its favorable safety profile under controlled light activation conditions. Beyond its approved photodynamic applications, preclinical studies have highlighted verteporfin’s effects in several fibrotic and proliferative disorders. In various in vitro and in vivo models—including studies on human tenon fibroblasts that induce fibrosis under conditions mimicking post‐glaucoma surgery, as well as investigations in trabecular meshwork and lamina cribrosa cells—verteporfin has been shown to inhibit YAP/TAZ signaling by preventing the nuclear localization and subsequent transcriptional activity of these mechanosensitive coactivators (Frömmichen et al., 2025; Murphy et al., 2022). Although no clinical trials to date have specifically evaluated verteporfin in the treatment of glaucoma, preclinical evidence from ocular fibrosis models and aqueous outflow studies in three‐dimensional setups has provided a mechanistic rationale for its use in this condition (ClinicalTrials.gov; Fung et al., 2024). Its use in fibrotic models of other organ systems, such as renal fibrosis where verteporfin promotes Smad protein degradation, further underscores its potential repurposing for ocular fibrotic conditions such as those seen in glaucoma (Szeto, 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, verteporfin functions by disrupting the transcriptional activity of YAP and TAZ. Under normal conditions—and particularly when mechanical cues such as extracellular matrix stiffness and TGF-β signaling are active—YAP and TAZ translocate to the nucleus where they bind to TEAD transcription factors and promote the expression of profibrotic and proliferative genes, including CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), fibronectin, and various collagen isoforms. Verteporfin interferes with this process by binding to YAP, thereby inhibiting the formation of the YAP–TEAD complex and preventing the subsequent transcription of target genes (Frömmichen et al., 2025; Sung et al., 2023). This inhibition is not limited to light-activated reactions; verteporfin exhibits these properties in the dark, making it a convenient candidate for off-label repurposing in diseases where light activation is neither required nor desirable. In addition, verteporfin’s action leads to a reduction in the expression of key profibrotic molecules, as evidenced in studies conducted in human tenon fibroblasts and trabecular meshwork cells. For example, reduced expression of α-SMA, fibronectin, and collagen has been documented in cellular models exposed to verteporfin, supporting its role in mitigating the fibrotic response (Frömmichen et al., 2025; Sung et al., 2023). At a signaling level, verteporfin’s inhibition of YAP/TAZ also disrupts the crosstalk with TGF-β-Smad pathways, as YAP/TAZ typically enhance Smad nuclear retention to drive the fibrotic transcriptional program. Consequently, verteporfin facilitates the proteasomal degradation of Smad proteins, further limiting fibrotic gene expression (Szeto, 2015; Wei & Li, 2020). Hence, by modulating both the YAP/TAZ and TGF-β-Smad axes, verteporfin directly targets the core pathogenic mechanism implicated in fibrosis within trabecular meshwork cells.

Expected Effect:
In the context of glaucoma, the proposed hypothesis is that verteporfin will inhibit YAP/TAZ nuclear activity in trabecular meshwork cells. Trabecular meshwork cells are critically involved in regulating aqueous humor outflow, and their function is compromised when fibrotic processes lead to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins and increased tissue stiffness. By disrupting the YAP–TEAD interaction, verteporfin is expected to attenuate the mechanoresponsive transcription of CTGF, fibronectin, and collagen. This reduction in fibrotic gene expression should, in turn, decrease matrix stiffness and improve the facility of aqueous humor outflow, thereby contributing to a reduction in intraocular pressure—a major risk factor for glaucoma progression (Sung et al., 2023; Fung et al., 2024). Experimental models utilizing three-dimensional aqueous outflow systems have shown that agents targeting fibrotic pathways can delay the increase in afferent line pressure, an analog for intraocular pressure, suggesting that verteporfin may have a similar beneficial effect in modulating trabecular meshwork physiology (Fung et al., 2024). Moreover, the expression of YAP and TAZ in trabecular meshwork cells has been well-documented, with their activation linked to the upregulation of profibrotic markers; therefore, the inhibition of these transcription factors by verteporfin is expected to restore more normal cellular architecture and function in the outflow pathway (Murphy et al., 2022; Sung et al., 2023). The overall effect anticipated is a reduction in trabecular meshwork fibrosis, leading to improved aqueous humor drainage, reduced outflow resistance, and ultimately lower intraocular pressure, which is the principal target of glaucoma therapy.

Overall Evaluation:
Verteporfin represents a promising candidate for repurposing as an anti-fibrotic agent in glaucoma, based on its robust mechanistic rationale and established clinical safety profile in ophthalmology. One of its primary strengths lies in its dual-action mechanism: while it has been used safely for PDT in retinal diseases, its ability to inhibit YAP/TAZ nuclear activity and disrupt the corresponding TEAD-mediated transcriptional program addresses a fundamental pathogenic process in glaucoma-related fibrosis. By reducing the expression of key profibrotic mediators such as CTGF, fibronectin, and collagen, verteporfin is expected to mitigate the fibrotic remodeling of the trabecular meshwork that compromises aqueous humor outflow. The mechanistic studies using human tenon fibroblasts and trabecular meshwork cell models provide compelling preclinical evidence supporting this hypothesis (Frömmichen et al., 2025; Sung et al., 2023).

Strengths of verteporfin include its well-documented pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, which facilitate faster clinical translation given its current FDA-approved status for ocular indications. Additionally, the preclinical evidence showing its efficacy in reducing fibrotic marker expression in relevant ocular cell types further underpins its potential utility in glaucoma. The molecular data, including its inhibitory effects on YAP/TAZ and subsequent downstream signaling, are robust and have been validated in various models of fibrosis, providing a strong foundation for its repurposing in glaucoma therapy (Sun et al., 2024; Szeto, 2015).

However, several weaknesses must be considered. First, although the in vitro studies and 3D model systems provide encouraging data, there remains a lack of direct clinical or in vivo evidence specifically in glaucoma patients. The translation from other fibrotic models (such as renal or dermal fibrosis) to trabecular meshwork fibrosis in glaucoma has not been fully established, and the nuances of ocular drug delivery in this context remain to be explored. Phototoxicity associated with verteporfin, while manageable in its conventional use with strict light controls, could pose challenges when repurposed for non-photoactivated anti-fibrotic therapy, particularly if dosing regimens differ from those traditionally used in PDT (Sung et al., 2023; Al-Moujahed et al., 2017). Furthermore, the optimal concentration and mode of administration (local versus systemic) to achieve effective YAP/TAZ inhibition in the trabecular meshwork without inducing off-target effects must be rigorously determined through preclinical studies. Finally, while verteporfin’s mechanism of action is well supported by mechanistic studies, the complexity of glaucoma pathogenesis—which includes not only fibrosis but also neurodegenerative components—suggests that verteporfin may be most effective as part of a combination therapy rather than as a stand-alone treatment.

In summary, verteporfin exhibits significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma through its ability to inhibit YAP/TAZ-mediated fibrotic pathways. Its existing clinical approval for ophthalmic uses, combined with compelling mechanistic data from multiple preclinical studies, supports its potential to reduce trabecular meshwork fibrosis, enhance aqueous humor outflow, and ultimately lower intraocular pressure—a critical objective in glaucoma management (Frömmichen et al., 2025; Fung et al., 2024; Murphy et al., 2022). While preclinical evidence is robust and the therapeutic rationale is sound, further targeted in vivo studies and early-phase clinical trials are necessary to clarify optimal dosing, delivery strategies, and long-term efficacy in glaucoma patients. Overall, the strengths of verteporfin, including its detailed molecular action and established safety profile, make it a compelling candidate for further development, with the primary weaknesses relating to the need for additional data in glaucoma-specific models and potential challenges related to drug delivery and phototoxicity management.

Pirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich cat. P2116).,"Proposal for Pirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich cat. P2116).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich cat. P2116) is a small synthetic pyridone derivative that was originally discovered and developed as an antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory agent. Its chemical design centers on a pyridone ring, which confers its unique biochemical properties through interaction with key signaling molecules involved in fibrotic processes. As a representative member of the small molecule antifibrotic class, pirfenidone has been extensively investigated for its ability to modulate cytokines, growth factors, and downstream signaling pathways that drive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. The synthesis of pirfenidone has been refined over decades of research, with chemical routes emphasizing high purity and reproducibility in generating the active pyridone moiety. Its development was originally aimed at conditions where fibrosis played a central role in disease progression, such as in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and its approval by regulatory authorities for IPF underscores its robust antifibrotic activity (Jahnke et al., 2024; Unknown Reference). As a member of the antifibrotic agent class, pirfenidone’s mechanism of action involves widespread inhibition of profibrotic mediators and has already been deployed in a number of systemic fibrotic disorders. This class of compounds has traditionally been used to reduce the progression of pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and cytokine production, thereby reducing tissue scarring and preserving organ function (Schaefer et al., 2011).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, pirfenidone was developed and clinically validated for its efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a severe and progressive lung disease characterized by excessive deposition of collagen and other ECM proteins. In preclinical and clinical studies, pirfenidone has demonstrated the capacity to reduce fibroblast proliferation, inhibit synthesis of collagen I and fibronectin, and downregulate transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling—an essential pathway implicated in fibrosis in multiple organ systems (Schaefer et al., 2011). Over the years, its safety and tolerability in human patients have been extensively documented, leading to regulatory approval in Europe and the United States for IPF management. In addition to IPF, pirfenidone has been evaluated in several fibrotic conditions affecting the kidney, liver, and heart. Notably, its antifibrotic effects have been observed in ocular contexts as well. Preclinical studies in animal models relevant to ophthalmology, particularly in rabbit and rat models of glaucoma filtration surgery, have provided evidence that pirfenidone can reduce postoperative scarring and maintain lower intraocular pressure (IOP) by limiting fibrotic encapsulation around implants (Park & Jung, 2016; Unknown Reference). Although no large-scale clinical trials have yet definitively assessed pirfenidone in glaucoma patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), the wealth of evidence demonstrating its antifibrotic capabilities in various preclinical settings offers promising translational potential for repurposing this drug in glaucoma, a disease in which ECM remodeling and fibrotic changes in the trabecular meshwork are critical pathologic features (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, pirfenidone exerts its antifibrotic activity through modulation of multiple signaling cascades, with a primary focus on inhibiting the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) pathway. TGF-β is a master regulator of fibrosis and has been shown to stimulate fibroblast proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation, and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen I and fibronectin. Pirfenidone interferes with TGF-β signal transduction by blocking the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad3—a critical intracellular mediator of TGF-β signaling (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Schaefer et al., 2011). By attenuating Smad3 phosphorylation, pirfenidone effectively reduces the transcription of profibrotic genes, including those coding for connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), collagen I, and fibronectin. This results in a reduced myofibroblast phenotype, as evidenced by lowered expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and diminished extracellular matrix remodeling. In addition, pirfenidone modulates other profibrotic mediators by downregulating various cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), further contributing to its overall antifibrotic profile (Jahnke et al., 2024; Park & Jung, 2016). The compound’s ability to interfere with TGF-β signaling is not limited to the lungs; rather, its suppression of Smad3 phosphorylation, CTGF expression, and ECM components has been observed in multiple cell types, including human retinal pigment epithelial cells and orbital fibroblasts. This broad spectrum activity underpins pirfenidone’s potential beneficial effects in ocular tissues where pathological fibrosis adversely affects aqueous humor outflow (Schaefer et al., 2011; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012).

Expected Effect:
Based on the established mechanism of action, the hypothesis for repurposing pirfenidone in glaucoma is that it will inhibit TGF-β–induced collagen I and fibronectin synthesis in human trabecular meshwork fibroblasts by blocking Smad3 phosphorylation and reducing CTGF expression. In a planned assay, treatment of cultured human trabecular meshwork fibroblasts with pirfenidone is expected to result in a significant reduction in profibrotic markers, including lower levels of collagen I and fibronectin as measured by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. This reduction in ECM component production should correlate with decreased fibroblast contractility and a reversion of the myofibroblast phenotype, thereby leading to less ECM stiffening and improved aqueous humor outflow. Given that human trabecular meshwork fibroblasts are known to express high levels of TGF-β receptors and respond robustly to TGF-β stimulation with increased Smad3 phosphorylation and upregulation of CTGF (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Hassan et al., 2023), pirfenidone’s action at these molecular nodes is expected to be both potent and therapeutically relevant. The anticipated cellular phenotype following pirfenidone treatment would be characterized by decreased activation of the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway, resulting in a lower profibrotic gene expression profile and reduced ECM deposition, as has been demonstrated in other fibrotic cell types and animal models (Jahnke et al., 2024; Park & Jung, 2016). This cellular outcome is expected to translate into improved trabecular meshwork flexibility and enhanced aqueous humor outflow in vivo, thereby contributing to IOP reduction—a principal goal in glaucoma management (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Faralli et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
In our evaluation of pirfenidone as a repurposed drug candidate for glaucoma, several strengths and potential weaknesses emerge. On the strength side, pirfenidone benefits from a well-established safety and tolerability profile based on extensive clinical use in pulmonary fibrosis and other fibrotic conditions. Its known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, characterized by rapid tissue penetration and clearance in ocular tissues following topical administration, provide a strong rationale for its repurposing in eye diseases (Unknown Reference; Unknown Reference). The drug’s mechanism of action, centered on inhibition of TGF-β/Smad3 signaling and downstream reduction of collagen I, fibronectin, and CTGF expression, directly targets the pathological processes known to drive trabecular meshwork fibrosis in glaucoma (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Prendes et al., 2013). Preclinical data from both retinal and glaucoma-related animal models have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing postoperative scarring and maintaining lower intraocular pressures, which underscores its potential applicability in glaucoma therapy (Park & Jung, 2016; Jahnke et al., 2024). Additionally, the versatility of pirfenidone in modulating profibrotic cytokines and ECM remodeling provides a significant advantage over current cytotoxic antifibrotic agents such as mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil, which have been associated with adverse side effects (Schaefer et al., 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The translational potential is further bolstered by the fact that TGF-β signaling pathways, as well as CTGF and ECM components like collagen and fibronectin, are not only critical in lung fibrosis but also play analogous roles in ocular fibrosis, particularly within the trabecular meshwork and in scar formation following glaucoma filtration surgery (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Hassan et al., 2023).

In terms of weaknesses, despite the promising preclinical evidence, there remains a paucity of direct clinical data or large-scale studies specifically examining pirfenidone’s efficacy and safety in glaucoma patients. Many of the studies supporting its potential have been conducted in animal models or in vitro systems using non-ocular cell types, which introduces uncertainty regarding its precise efficacy in human trabecular meshwork fibroblasts and its long-term impact on aqueous humor dynamics (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hu et al., 2021). Moreover, while the molecular mechanisms of action are well characterized, the optimal dosing regimen, delivery method (topical versus systemic), and potential ocular toxicity require further rigorous evaluation in well-designed preclinical ocular studies and subsequent clinical trials. Another potential challenge is the complexity of glaucoma pathophysiology itself; although ECM remodeling in the trabecular meshwork is a critical contributor to increased IOP, other factors such as neurodegeneration and vascular dysregulation also play significant roles. Thus, while targeting fibrotic processes may improve outflow facility, it may need to be combined with other therapeutic strategies to comprehensively address glaucoma progression (Hachana & Larrivée, 2022; Murphy-Ullrich & Downs, 2015). Furthermore, from a drug development perspective, repurposing an oral antifibrotic agent for ocular use necessitates rigorous formulation development to ensure tissue-specific delivery and sustained pharmacological action in the anterior segment of the eye. Although early pharmacokinetic studies in animal models have shown promising ocular penetration and a favorable safety profile in terms of local irritation, these findings must be validated in human studies to fully assess the clinical utility of pirfenidone in glaucoma (Unknown Reference; Lv et al., 2020).

Overall, pirfenidone stands out as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of glaucoma owing to its well-documented antifibrotic properties, established clinical safety profile in systemic fibrotic diseases, and clear mechanistic link to the TGF-β/Smad3/CTGF signaling axis that underlies fibrotic changes in the trabecular meshwork. The expected benefit of reducing ECM stiffening and contractility in the trabecular meshwork to restore aqueous humor outflow addresses a fundamental pathogenic mechanism in glaucoma. In light of the preclinical evidence supporting its use—such as reduced post-surgical scarring and IOP maintenance in animal models—and the molecular rationale based on inhibition of key profibrotic mediators, further development of pirfenidone for ocular antifibrotic therapy is justified. Nevertheless, additional studies are warranted to refine the delivery system, confirm efficacy in human trabecular meshwork cells, and establish the long-term safety and therapeutic impact in clinical glaucoma populations. Overall, the strengths in mechanistic specificity and established pharmacological profile appear to outweigh the challenges, rendering pirfenidone a compelling candidate for further investigation in the context of glaucoma (Jahnke et al., 2024; Park & Jung, 2016; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Hassan et al., 2023).

"KD025 (SLx-2119), a selective ROCK2 inhibitor.","Proposal for KD025 (SLx-2119), a selective ROCK2 inhibitor.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
KD025, also known as SLx-2119 or Belumosudil, is a small molecule that was developed through medicinal chemistry optimization with the goal of achieving selective inhibition of Rho-associated coiled‐coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2). As a synthetic compound, KD025 belongs to the class of kinase inhibitors, a group of molecules designed to target and modulate specific enzymes involved in intracellular signaling. ROCK inhibitors in general have been extensively investigated for their role in modulating contractility, cytoskeletal dynamics, fibrosis, and immune responses, with several compounds already in clinical use for diverse indications. In the case of KD025, the design strategy was focused on maximizing selectivity toward ROCK2, thereby reducing the off‐target effects—such as vascular hypotension and ocular hyperemia—that are frequently associated with nonselective or ROCK1/ROCK2 dual inhibitors. This molecular fine‐tuning is achieved by exploiting subtle differences in the ATP-binding pocket of ROCK2 relative to ROCK1, leading to an inhibitor that not only attenuates phosphorylation events downstream of ROCK2 but also potentially limits adverse pharmacodynamic effects observed with other compounds in this class (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
KD025’s clinical development history has largely focused on immune‐mediated and fibrotic conditions. In multiple phase 1 and phase 2 trials, KD025 has been tested for safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers and patients with conditions such as chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) and psoriasis. For instance, clinical trial identifiers NCT02106195 and NCT05918614 document studies where Belumosudil was evaluated in subjects with immune dysregulation and fibrotic disorders, providing a substantial foundation regarding its systemic safety and bioavailability (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014a; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014b). Although ROCK inhibitors such as ripasudil and netarsudil have an established record in treating ocular hypertension and glaucoma, KD025 itself has not been directly tested or approved for ocular diseases. Nonetheless, the growing body of literature supporting the relevance of ROCK pathways in modulating trabecular meshwork physiology has prompted interest in repurposing KD025 for glaucoma. The rationale stems from the fact that other ROCK inhibitors, which target both ROCK1 and ROCK2 isoforms, have successfully demonstrated efficacy in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) through relaxation of the trabecular meshwork. Therefore, while KD025’s therapeutic history has predominantly been in the realm of immune modulation and antifibrotic therapy, early-phase pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerability data in healthy subjects indicate that its safety profile could make it a promising candidate for repurposing to treat glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014a; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014b).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, KD025 functions by selectively inhibiting ROCK2. ROCK2 is one of the two isoforms (the other being ROCK1) that are downstream effectors of the Rho family of small GTPases. When activated, ROCK2 phosphorylates several substrates, including myosin light chain (MLC) and the myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), leading to enhancement of actomyosin contractility. The increased phosphorylation of MLC results in the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions that contribute to cellular contractility and rigidity. In the context of glaucoma, this contractile behavior in trabecular meshwork (TM) cells is a key contributor to increased outflow resistance for aqueous humor, thereby elevating IOP. By selectively inhibiting ROCK2, KD025 is anticipated to reduce MLC phosphorylation, leading to disassembly of stress fibers, relaxation of TM cells, and attenuation of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. This cascade of effects theoretically improves aqueous humor outflow. In addition to decreasing cell contractility, ROCK2 inhibition has been associated with anti‐fibrotic and anti‐inflammatory effects; these may reduce pathological tissue remodeling and scarring that can occur after glaucoma filtration surgeries (Liu et al., 2024, pp. 4–5; Wu et al., 2024, pp. 4–5). The underlying biochemical interactions include the binding of KD025 to the catalytic domain of ROCK2 in an ATP-competitive manner, which prevents the phosphorylation of downstream effectors critical for maintaining a contractile cytoskeletal framework. Although direct structural details about how KD025 distinguishes between ROCK2 and ROCK1 are beyond the provided context, the conceptual framework is well supported by studies showing that selective inhibition of ROCK2 can dampen fibrotic signaling and cellular contractility while offering a potentially improved side effect profile relative to less selective inhibitors (Kim et al., 2021, pp. 2–3).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis driving the repurposing of KD025 for glaucoma management is centered on its ability to selectively reduce ROCK2-mediated contractility in the trabecular meshwork cells. In conventional in vitro assays using primary human TM cells or model systems, KD025 is expected to decrease the phosphorylation levels of MLC, leading to disassembly of actin stress fibers and reduced cell contractility. This molecular action should translate into a relaxation of the TM, effectively lowering resistance to aqueous humor outflow. By diminishing ECM deposition and fibrotic remodeling, KD025 could further optimize the tissue architecture of the TM, contributing to sustained IOP reduction. Importantly, ROCK2 is known to be expressed in TM cells, and studies using other ROCK inhibitors have demonstrated that modulation of ROCK signaling in the TM is a viable route for lowering IOP (Liu et al., 2024, pp. 11–12; Wu et al., 2024, pp. 4–5). The additional benefit of KD025’s selectivity lies in its potential to minimize adverse vascular effects, such as ocular hyperemia and systemic hypotension, which have been noted with nonselective inhibitors that target both ROCK isoforms. Thus, the anticipated effect is a targeted improvement in aqueous humor outflow due to relaxed TM cell contractility and reduced ECM deposition, without the unwanted side effects commonly associated with broader ROCK inhibition (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
The prospect of repurposing KD025 for glaucoma therapy is scientifically compelling based on several interrelated factors. First, its selective inhibition of ROCK2 addresses key pathophysiological processes in the trabecular meshwork, namely increased cellular contractility and ECM deposition, which are central to aqueous humor outflow resistance and elevated IOP. These mechanistic insights are supported by preclinical research demonstrating that ROCK inhibitors can modulate the cytoskeleton and contractility of TM cells, thereby improving outflow facility (Liu et al., 2024, pp. 4–5; Wu et al., 2024, pp. 4–5). Second, the robust safety and tolerability data from KD025’s use in systemic fibrotic and immune-mediated disorders provide a solid foundation for its potential redeployment in ophthalmology. The engineered selectivity toward ROCK2 may yield a favorable safety profile with fewer systemic vascular side effects—an important consideration when the therapeutic target is the delicate vascular and contractile function of the eye (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014b; Kim et al., 2021, pp. 2–3). Third, although KD025 has not been previously used for ophthalmic indications, the extensive clinical experience with other ROCK inhibitors in glaucoma—such as ripasudil and netarsudil, which have demonstrated efficacy in lowering IOP—lends credence to the hypothesis that selective ROCK2 inhibition could have similar or even improved efficacy with reduced side effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Liu et al., 2024, pp. 2–4).

Nevertheless, there are also key challenges and weaknesses that must be addressed. The primary limitation is the lack of direct preclinical or clinical evidence for KD025 specifically in ocular models or glaucoma patients. Most of the available data derive from studies in systemic diseases or preclinical fibrosis models. As such, the translatability of these findings to the ocular environment remains uncertain. Moreover, while the hypothesis that selective ROCK2 inhibition will reduce vascular side effects is attractive, it is possible that the inhibition of ROCK2 alone may not fully recapitulate the multifaceted effects observed with nonselective ROCK inhibitors, which might be necessary for optimal IOP reduction in some patient populations. Additionally, the precise contributions of ROCK1 and ROCK2 in TM physiology are still not completely delineated, and it may be that sufficient modulation of aqueous outflow requires combined inhibition of both isoforms. Finally, the competitive landscape in glaucoma drug development is crowded, with several approved agents and new compounds continuously emerging. Therefore, any new candidate such as KD025 will need to demonstrate clear advantages over existing therapies in terms of efficacy, safety, or both, before it can justify the investment in additional clinical trials (Liu et al., 2024, pp. 4–5; Kim et al., 2021, pp. 2–3).

In summary, KD025 (SLx-2119) represents a promising therapeutic candidate for glaucoma based on its well-understood mechanism of selective ROCK2 inhibition, its ability to potentially reduce contractility and fibrotic remodeling in trabecular meshwork cells, and its favorable systemic safety profile observed in other disease contexts. The strengths of KD025 include its molecular specificity, which may translate to fewer vascular side effects and improved tolerability, and its mechanism of action, which directly targets pathophysiological mechanisms known to contribute to increased IOP. However, the primary weaknesses lie in the current absence of direct evidence for ocular efficacy and the need for further research to fully elucidate the role of ROCK2 in TM regulation relative to ROCK1. The next steps should involve focused preclinical studies using ex vivo human TM models and in vivo animal models of glaucoma to directly evaluate KD025’s impact on IOP, TM cell dynamics, and ECM remodeling. Such studies, in conjunction with optimized drug delivery strategies to the eye, will be essential to determine whether KD025 can fulfill its promise as a repurposed therapy for glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Liu et al., 2024, pp. 11–12; Wu et al., 2024, pp. 4–5).

Overall, the repurposing of KD025 for glaucoma is scientifically justified and meritorious, yet it requires a well-planned translational development program that addresses existing gaps in the direct ocular evidence base. Continued research in this direction could eventually provide a novel therapeutic option that offers both effective IOP reduction and an improved side-effect profile compared to current ROCK inhibitors and conventional glaucoma medications (Kim et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014b).

"Losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker.","Proposal for Losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Losartan is an orally active small molecule originally developed as an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker (ARB) that is widely used in the management of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. Chemically synthesized as a biphenyl derivative, Losartan belongs to the class of non-peptide ARBs, a category of drugs that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These compounds were designed to selectively antagonize AT1 receptors, thereby inhibiting the vasoconstrictive, proinflammatory, and profibrotic actions of angiotensin II. Losartan’s discovery was driven by the need for antihypertensive agents with a favorable side effect profile compared to older drugs such as ACE inhibitors, with the added advantage that ARBs, including Losartan, do not cause the increased bradykinin levels associated with cough or angioedema. Over the years, its extensive use in cardiovascular medicine has established a robust safety profile and predictable pharmacokinetics, and its known capacity to achieve therapeutic drug levels in various tissues has generated interest in its potential repurposing for other conditions, including ocular diseases like glaucoma (White et al., 2015; Wilson, 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Losartan, as a representative of the ARB family, has a well-documented history in the treatment of systemic hypertension, heart failure, and renal disease. Its use in the cardiovascular arena is supported by numerous large-scale clinical trials that have consistently demonstrated its efficacy in reducing blood pressure and preventing target organ damage. In addition to its systemic roles, preclinical studies have documented its antifibrotic properties in organs such as the kidney and heart, where Losartan has been shown to reduce extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and inhibit transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)–driven fibrosis. Notably, the antifibrotic effects of Losartan have been well established in models of aortic aneurysm in Marfan syndrome and in renal fibrosis, where its capacity to interfere with AT1R-mediated profibrotic signaling is key (Kuchtey & Kuchtey, 2014; Igic, 2018). Although Losartan has not yet been widely adopted for glaucoma treatment, several preclinical studies have proposed its utility in ocular settings. Research indicates that components of the local ocular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) play critical roles in regulating intraocular pressure (IOP) and in mediating fibrotic responses in the trabecular meshwork (TM) and sclera. In animal models, treatment with Losartan has been associated with neuroprotective effects on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) as well as alterations in scleral remodeling that are beneficial in the context of glaucoma (Quigley et al., 2015; Oh et al., 2023). This translational evidence, although still primarily preclinical, establishes a basis for repurposing Losartan for glaucoma therapy, taking advantage of its established safety and pharmacologic profile derived from decades of systemic use (Hirooka & Kiuchi, 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Losartan acts through competitive inhibition of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). Inhibition of AT1R prevents the binding of angiotensin II (Ang II), a peptide hormone that normally induces vasoconstriction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrogenesis. Ang II signaling via AT1R is known to stimulate the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) pathway, which in turn activates intracellular signaling cascades characterized by the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3. The phosphorylated SMAD complexes translocate to the nucleus where they drive the transcription of genes involved in extracellular matrix synthesis, cell contraction, and fibrosis. This process is critically implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, particularly in promoting fibrotic remodeling of the trabecular meshwork (TM) that leads to increased outflow resistance, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), and subsequent retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss (Kuchtey & Kuchtey, 2014; Li et al., 2023).
Losartan’s antagonism at AT1R is selective, meaning that it prevents the deleterious effects of Ang II on TGF-β activation without interfering with the potentially beneficial signaling mediated by angiotensin II type 2 receptors (AT2R), which can counteract fibrosis. This selectivity may allow Losartan not only to reduce ECM deposition in TM cells by inhibiting SMAD2/3 phosphorylation but also to modulate trabecular meshwork cell contraction, thereby potentially improving aqueous humor outflow (Quigley et al., 2015; Kuchtey & Kuchtey, 2014). Moreover, Losartan is reported to exhibit antifibrotic effects in other tissue systems by reducing TGF-β levels and its downstream signaling cascades, suggesting a conserved mechanism that could be extrapolated to ocular tissues (Hirooka & Kiuchi, 2022; Kurihara et al., 2012). This molecular understanding is further reinforced by preclinical data indicating that Losartan’s inhibition of AT1R leads to a reduction in both ECM synthesis and cell contraction in key ocular tissues, thereby decreasing resistance in the aqueous outflow pathway (Oh et al., 2023).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis that modulation of the ocular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in glaucoma pathogenesis, the expected therapeutic effect of Losartan is multifaceted. Primarily, by preventing Ang II–mediated activation of latent TGF-β, Losartan would be anticipated to reduce SMAD2/3 phosphorylation in trabecular meshwork cells. This would lead to decreased transcription of fibrosis-related genes and a subsequent reduction in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and cell contraction. In the context of glaucoma, such antifibrotic effects would likely improve the physiology of the trabecular meshwork, enhance aqueous humor outflow, and thus help lower and better control intraocular pressure (IOP) (Igic, 2018; Li et al., 2023).
Additionally, preclinical studies have demonstrated that Losartan can protect retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from degeneration in experimental glaucoma models through its influence on tissue remodeling and neuroprotection. For instance, systemic administration of Losartan in animal models showed reduced fibrosis in ocular tissues—particularly in the sclera—altered mechanical properties that could mitigate the stress on the optic nerve head, and ultimately decreased RGC loss (Quigley et al., 2015; Oh et al., 2023). The expression of AT1R and local RAS components in the trabecular meshwork and scleral fibroblasts provides a strong molecular rationale for these effects, with relevant studies showing that these receptors are present in tissues critical for aqueous humor dynamics (White et al., 2015). Thus, the expected outcome in the proposed assays would be a measurable reduction in TGF-β signaling markers such as SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, decreased ECM protein deposition (e.g., collagen type I), and reduced cellular contractility in trabecular meshwork cells, ultimately translating into improved outflow facility and potentially lower IOP (Kuchtey & Kuchtey, 2014; Kurihara et al., 2012).

Overall Evaluation:
Losartan presents a compelling candidate for repurposing to treat glaucoma based on several converging lines of evidence. One major strength lies in its well-established safety profile and widespread clinical adoption in cardiovascular medicine, which minimizes the risk of unforeseeable adverse effects when administering a known drug systemically. Its ability to inhibit AT1R offers a clear mechanistic route to prevent Ang II–mediated TGF-β activation, a central driver of extracellular matrix remodeling and fibrosis within the trabecular meshwork—a key pathologic process in glaucoma (Hirooka & Kiuchi, 2022; Quigley et al., 2015). Furthermore, preclinical evidence supports that Losartan not only modulates the biochemical pathways critical for ECM synthesis and cell contraction but also confers neuroprotective benefits by preserving retinal ganglion cell survival through alterations in scleral remodeling and attenuation of fibrotic responses (Quigley et al., 2015; Oh et al., 2023). This dual action—improving aqueous outflow by targeting TM fibrosis and protecting retinal neurons—addresses both the mechanical and neurodegenerative facets of glaucoma pathophysiology.

Nonetheless, there are potential challenges and weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. Although Losartan has shown promising ocular penetration in preclinical studies and has been effective in modifying fibrotic responses in tissues outside the eye, direct clinical evidence in glaucoma patients is currently sparse. No large-scale clinical trials have been registered to assess its efficacy specifically for glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), and the translation of systemic antifibrotic effects to localized ocular benefits remains uncertain. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of Losartan in ocular tissues must be carefully characterized to ensure that therapeutic concentrations can be achieved in the trabecular meshwork without provoking systemic hypotension that could adversely affect ocular perfusion pressure (Quigley et al., 2015; Wilson, 2023). Furthermore, while the biochemical rationale is robust, the precise interactions between Losartan’s inhibition of AT1R and the downstream TGF-β/SMAD2/3 pathway in trabecular meshwork cells need further elucidation with dedicated in vitro and in vivo studies, including confirmation of changes in ECM synthesis and cell contractility relevant to aqueous outflow dynamics (Kuchtey & Kuchtey, 2014; Li et al., 2023).

In conclusion, based on the comprehensive literature review spanning biomedical, clinical, and biochemical studies, Losartan demonstrates substantial potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma. Its established systemic safety and antifibrotic efficacy, combined with encouraging preclinical evidence regarding ocular RAS modulation, position it as an attractive candidate warranting further detailed investigation. The outlined hypothesis—that Losartan will prevent Ang II–mediated activation of latent TGF-β in trabecular meshwork cells, reduce SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, lessen ECM synthesis, and ultimately improve aqueous outflow—is well supported by existing mechanistic studies in related tissue systems (Hirooka & Kiuchi, 2022; Quigley et al., 2015). Future research should focus on rigorous pharmacokinetic profiling in ocular tissues, dose optimization to avoid systemic effects, and well-designed preclinical and ultimately clinical trials to validate efficacy in human glaucoma patients. Overall, while certain knowledge gaps exist—chiefly regarding direct clinical data in glaucoma—the preclinical evidence and mechanistic rationale strongly justify Losartan’s continued evaluation as a promising drug candidate in the treatment of glaucoma (Igic, 2018; Oh et al., 2023).

"Candesartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker.","Proposal for Candesartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Candesartan is a synthetic small‐molecule angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) that was initially discovered and developed for systemic treatment of hypertension. It belongs to the class of ARBs, which function by selectively antagonizing the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), thereby preventing angiotensin II from eliciting its vasoconstrictive, pro-fibrotic, and pro-inflammatory effects. Candesartan is chemically derived from earlier prototype ARBs and has been optimized for high binding affinity and prolonged receptor interaction, making it a potent and long-acting agent. Historically, ARBs have been synthesized by chemical modification of peptide structures related to angiotensin II, leading to non-peptide antagonists that offer improved oral bioavailability and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Candesartan is among the most established drugs in this class, with extensive use in cardiovascular medicine, and recent studies have highlighted its potential to affect local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity in the eye (Al-khfajy, Jwaid, & Al-Mashhadani, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a).

Therapeutic History:
Candesartan has been used worldwide for decades as an antihypertensive agent based on its efficacy in lowering blood pressure and reducing cardiovascular events. As an ARB, it has also been shown to be effective in managing heart failure and providing renal protective effects. The safety profile of candesartan in systemic applications is well established through numerous clinical trials and widespread clinical use. Beyond its cardiovascular indications, preclinical studies have revealed that ARBs, including candesartan, can penetrate ocular tissues following systemic administration and exhibit activity in modulating local ocular RAS components (Al-khfajy, Jwaid, & Al-Mashhadani, 2018). Although the majority of clinical studies for ARBs have focused on systemic diseases, several preclinical investigations have demonstrated that ARBs can lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in animal models through mechanisms that include modulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in the trabecular meshwork and sclera (Soler, 2022). However, a search of ClinicalTrials.gov reveals that there are no registered clinical trials specifically investigating candesartan for glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b), which suggests that, while repurposing for glaucoma has been proposed in recent literature, clinical evidence remains limited. Nevertheless, similar compounds within the ARB class, such as losartan and telmisartan, have provided proof-of-concept data in various glaucoma models (Hazlewood et al., 2018; Quigley et al., 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
Candesartan exerts its pharmacological effects by binding selectively to AT1R, a receptor that mediates many of the adverse effects of angiotensin II, including vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis, and cellular proliferation. At the molecular level, binding of angiotensin II to AT1R stimulates intracellular second messenger cascades such as the phospholipase C/IP3/DAG pathway, leading to increased intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinases that ultimately promote transcription of fibrotic and pro-inflammatory genes. Importantly, in the context of the eye, engagement of AT1R has been linked to activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways. TGF-β is a key cytokine that drives fibrosis by inducing collagen synthesis and promoting extracellular matrix deposition in ocular tissues including the trabecular meshwork, sclera, and retina (Choudhary et al., 2017). By antagonizing AT1R, candesartan is expected to inhibit angiotensin II-induced TGF-β activation, thereby reducing the synthesis of ECM proteins like collagen type I and decreasing cytoskeletal contractility. This mechanism is further supported by preclinical studies demonstrating that ARBs downregulate TGF-β signaling—reflected by diminished phosphorylation of Smad proteins—and reduce fibrotic marker expression (Hazlewood et al., 2018; Choudhary et al., 2017). In addition to these antifibrotic effects, ARBs may also provide neuroprotective benefits by mitigating oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades that contribute to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, as shown in models of normal tension glaucoma (Semba et al., 2014). Thus, the molecular interaction of candesartan with AT1R potentially interferes with multiple pathological processes: it reduces ECM remodeling in the trabecular outflow pathway and diminishes pro-inflammatory and fibrotic signaling in retinal tissues.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underpinning the repurposing of candesartan for glaucoma is that its AT1R blockade in trabecular meshwork cells will inhibit angiotensin II-induced TGF-β activation. In the proposed assay, this is expected to result in decreased expression of fibrotic markers such as collagen type I and α-smooth muscle actin, as well as a reduction in cytoskeletal contractility. These changes should, in turn, improve aqueous humor outflow facility, thus lowering IOP—a crucial risk factor in glaucoma progression. Preclinical data support the notion that ARBs can reduce markers of ocular fibrosis and maladaptive extracellular matrix remodeling in ocular tissues (Hazlewood et al., 2018; Choudhary et al., 2017). Moreover, studies employing animal models of glaucoma have demonstrated that ARBs not only lower IOP but also confer neuroprotection to retinal ganglion cells by reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting inflammatory mediators (Semba et al., 2014; Oh et al., 2023). Given that AT1R is known to be expressed in trabecular meshwork cells, as well as in other ocular cell types involved in regulating outflow and structural integrity of the optic nerve head, the expected biochemical response to candesartan in the proposed assay is strongly supported by the literature (Choudhary et al., 2017; Al-khfajy, Jwaid, & Al-Mashhadani, 2018). The cumulative effect would be a reduction in ECM deposition and cytoskeletal contraction in the trabecular meshwork, leading to improved aqueous humor drainage and a consequent reduction in intraocular pressure, thereby addressing glaucoma pathophysiology from both a biomechanical and neuroprotective standpoint.

Overall Evaluation:
The review of the literature indicates that candesartan is a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma due to its well-characterized pharmacology, established safety profile in cardiovascular disorders, and multiple preclinical studies supporting its role in modulating detrimental ocular processes. One of the primary strengths of candesartan is its high affinity for AT1R and its capacity to penetrate ocular tissues, as demonstrated by pharmacokinetic studies in animal models (Soler, 2022; Al-khfajy, Jwaid, & Al-Mashhadani, 2018). Its mechanism of action, which involves the inhibition of angiotensin II-induced TGF-β signaling, directly addresses key pathological mechanisms in glaucoma—namely, the fibrosis and extracellular matrix remodeling that contribute to decreased outflow facility in the trabecular meshwork (Choudhary et al., 2017; Hazlewood et al., 2018). Additionally, neuroprotective effects observed in experimental models, including preservation of retinal ganglion cells and attenuation of inflammatory responses, further enhance its therapeutic potential (Semba et al., 2014).

Despite these promising attributes, several weaknesses need consideration. The clinical evidence for using candesartan specifically in glaucoma remains sparse, as highlighted by the lack of registered clinical trials directly testing candesartan for this indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b). This limitation suggests a gap between preclinical proof-of-concept data and the translation of these findings into clinical practice. Moreover, while animal studies have demonstrated effective ocular penetration and IOP-lowering effects with topical formulations of ARBs, it is not yet clear whether similar formulations of candesartan would achieve comparable efficacy and safety in humans (Soler, 2022). Another potential weakness is the multifactorial nature of glaucoma, where elevated IOP is one of several contributing factors. The neuroprotective and antifibrotic actions of candesartan are compelling; however, there may be patient subpopulations (for example, those with normal-tension glaucoma) in whom these mechanisms have limited impact on disease progression (Semba et al., 2014). In addition, while the inhibition of TGF-β signaling is beneficial in reducing fibrosis, TGF-β also has roles in normal tissue homeostasis and wound healing, meaning that long-term inhibition could potentially lead to unintended consequences in ocular tissues.

Overall, candesartan holds considerable promise as a repurposed candidate for glaucoma therapy based on its specific mechanism of blocking AT1R, its established role in modulating TGF-β-driven fibrotic pathways, and its potential neuroprotective effects in the optic nerve head and retina. Its favorable safety profile in systemic use and demonstrated efficacy in preclinical ocular studies make it a strong candidate for further investigation. However, there remains a significant need for targeted clinical studies to assess optimal dosing, formulation (e.g., topical delivery systems that ensure adequate intraocular bioavailability), and long-term safety, as well as to clarify its effects on trabecular meshwork cells and aqueous humor dynamics in the context of glaucoma. In summary, the strengths of candesartan include its high receptor affinity, extensive preclinical data supporting antifibrotic and neuroprotective roles, and established clinical safety in hypertension, whereas its weaknesses center on the current lack of direct clinical trial data for glaucoma and the challenges of translating systemic pharmacology to effective ocular therapy (Al-khfajy, Jwaid, & Al-Mashhadani, 2018; Choudhary et al., 2017; Soler, 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b). Further research and well-designed clinical trials will be essential to determine whether candesartan can fulfill its promising preclinical potential as a novel therapeutic for glaucoma.

"Pamrevlumab (FG-3019), an anti–CTGF monoclonal antibody.","Proposal for Pamrevlumab (FG-3019), an anti–CTGF monoclonal antibody.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pamrevlumab (also known as FG-3019) is a humanized monoclonal antibody belonging to the class of biologic agents that target extracellular proteins involved in fibrotic pathways. Originally developed for the treatment of systemic fibrotic conditions, Pamrevlumab specifically neutralizes connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a matricellular protein that plays a critical role in mediating extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and tissue scarring. CTGF is a downstream mediator of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling and is responsible for amplifying fibrotic responses by stimulating the synthesis of collagen, fibronectin, and other ECM proteins. The molecule is produced via recombinant DNA technology in mammalian cell lines, ensuring proper folding and post-translational modifications that are essential for its high specificity toward CTGF. As part of the growing field of antibody-based anti-fibrotic therapies, Pamrevlumab has been primarily evaluated in clinical trials targeting idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and other systemic fibrotic disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Its design capitalizes on the potential to specifically block pathological CTGF activity without broadly inhibiting TGF-β, thereby preserving TGF-β’s homeostatic functions and suggesting an improved safety profile when compared to less selective agents (Wallace et al., 2013).

Therapeutic History:
Pamrevlumab’s clinical development history is rooted in its strong antifibrotic activity observed in several non-ocular settings. In clinical trials for IPF (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011) and diabetic nephropathy (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2009), the antibody has demonstrated target engagement as evidenced by reduced ECM deposition and favorable tolerability profiles. Although its use in glaucoma per se has not been directly investigated in clinical studies, extensive preclinical evidence indicates that CTGF is a critical driver of fibrotic processes in various tissues—including ocular structures such as the trabecular meshwork (TM) and lamina cribrosa (LC). Elevated CTGF levels in these ocular tissues are associated with increased deposition of ECM proteins like collagen type I and fibronectin, which in turn contribute to reduced aqueous humor (AH) outflow and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma (Hassan et al., 2023; Wallace et al., 2013). In addition, studies evaluating other anti-CTGF strategies in ocular models have shown that neutralizing CTGF can reverse fibrotic changes in the TM and decrease the stiffness of these tissues (Dillinger, 2019; van Setten et al., 2016). These findings provide a strong mechanistic rationale to repurpose Pamrevlumab for the treatment of glaucomatous fibrosis despite the absence of direct clinical data in this indication. Furthermore, the safety data gathered from systemic trials—in which Pamrevlumab was administered intravenously in patients with fibrotic diseases such as IPF (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011, 2020) and DMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016)—suggest that the antibody is well tolerated, a critical consideration when evaluating its potential for ocular application (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2003).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, CTGF operates as a central mediator in fibrosis, acting downstream from TGF-β signaling to promote the synthesis and deposition of ECM components including collagen and fibronectin. Pamrevlumab exerts its therapeutic effect by binding to a specific region within CTGF, most notably the von Willebrand factor type C (VWC) domain. This binding interrupts CTGF’s interaction with its downstream effectors and receptors on fibroblasts, thereby inhibiting the activation of profibrotic signaling cascades such as those involving mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and other intracellular pathways (Chen et al., 2020). In vitro studies using human TM and LC cells have demonstrated that exposure to oxidative stress or glaucomatous aqueous humor leads to an upregulation of CTGF and subsequent increases in the expression of fibrotic markers—including fibronectin, collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1), fibrillin-1, and α-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) (Wallace et al., 2013). When these cells are pretreated with an anti-CTGF antibody such as Pamrevlumab, there is a significant reduction in the expression levels of these profibrotic markers, which correlates with a reduction in ECM deposition. This suggests that CTGF is not only centrally involved in mediating fibrosis but also serves as a specific and effective therapeutic target to block ECM overproduction without affecting upstream regulatory elements like TGF-β that are essential for normal cellular functions (Fu et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2024). By neutralizing CTGF, Pamrevlumab should theoretically prevent the downstream activation of fibroblasts in the TM, reducing ECM accumulation and thus mitigating the mechanical stiffening of the TM that limits aqueous humor outflow—the primary pathogenic mechanism underlying the elevation of intraocular pressure in glaucoma (Fuchshofer et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
Within the context of glaucoma, the hypothesis driving the repurposing of Pamrevlumab is that it will neutralize CTGF in the trabecular meshwork, a tissue crucial to the regulation of aqueous humor outflow. In glaucomatous eyes, increased levels of CTGF are associated with an overproduction of ECM components, including collagen I and fibronectin, which lead to fibrotic remodeling and stiffening of the TM. This fibrotic process increases outflow resistance and, consequently, elevates intraocular pressure—a well-established risk factor for optic nerve damage in glaucoma (Hassan et al., 2023). The expected effect of Pamrevlumab, in this case, is to bind CTGF and thereby block its ability to stimulate collagen and fibronectin synthesis. Preclinical studies have provided evidence that CTGF inhibition can downregulate profibrotic gene expression in TM cells and reduce pathological ECM accumulation (Wallace et al., 2013; van Setten et al., 2016). Moreover, the presence of CTGF in the aqueous humor and its documented overexpression in glaucomatous tissues support the rationale that targeting CTGF will lead to normalization of the ECM composition in the TM, restoration of tissue pliability, and improved aqueous humor drainage, thereby reducing intraocular pressure (Hassan et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2021). Given that Pamrevlumab has already demonstrated target engagement and a favorable safety profile in systemic fibrotic conditions, its application in an ocular setting is logically anticipated to yield similar antifibrotic effects, provided that effective local delivery methods can be developed to overcome ocular pharmacokinetic challenges (Unknown Reference; Khaw et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
The comprehensive literature review indicates that Pamrevlumab (FG-3019) represents a very promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of glaucoma, particularly in addressing the fibrotic changes that contribute to elevated intraocular pressure. Its strengths include a well-defined mechanism of action that targets CTGF specifically—a key mediator downstream of TGF-β responsible for ECM overproduction in the trabecular meshwork—and a proven safety profile in Phase II clinical trials for systemic fibrosis such as IPF and DMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; 2016). The highly specific targeting of CTGF by Pamrevlumab minimizes interference with TGF-β’s physiological roles, which reduces the risk of adverse effects commonly seen with broader antifibrotic or anti-inflammatory therapies (Chen et al., 2020; Sheibani, 2022).

However, there are also significant challenges and weaknesses associated with repurposing Pamrevlumab for glaucoma. First, although preclinical data strongly support the role of CTGF in ocular fibrosis—particularly in the trabecular meshwork—the direct evidence of Pamrevlumab’s efficacy in ocular models of glaucoma remains limited. Most of the existing clinical data pertain to fibrotic diseases of the lungs, kidney, or muscle rather than the eye (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008). This gap necessitates robust preclinical ocular studies to evaluate the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of Pamrevlumab when administered via ocular routes, such as intravitreal injection or topical formulations. Delivery poses another challenge given the ocular barriers that may limit systemic bioavailability to anterior segment tissues. The large molecular size of monoclonal antibodies further complicates their penetration into targeted ocular tissues, meaning that novel drug delivery systems—possibly nanoparticle-based carriers or sustained-release formulations—must be developed to ensure sufficient local concentrations of the drug in the trabecular meshwork (Lim et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2024).

Another potential weakness is the possibility of off-target effects or systemic exposure following ocular administration. Although anti-CTGF therapies are known for their specificity, CTGF is expressed in multiple ocular tissues beyond the trabecular meshwork, including the lamina cribrosa and retina, which raises the need for careful evaluation of adverse effects in these regions. Safety assessments drawn from systemic trials might not fully predict ocular tolerability, particularly given the delicate architecture and unique physiological conditions of the eye (Sarkis et al., 2025; van Setten et al., 2016).

On the biochemical and mechanistic fronts, the rationale for targeting CTGF in glaucoma is compelling. CTGF amplification of fibrotic signals downstream of TGF-β has been well documented (Dillinger, 2019; Fu et al., 2022), and its inhibition has been shown in vitro to reduce expression of ECM proteins that contribute to increased outflow resistance. Moreover, clinical studies in fibrotic conditions have confirmed that blocking CTGF can lead to significant reductions in ECM deposition, lending credence to the hypothesis that similar antifibrotic effects could be achieved in glaucomatous eyes (Wallace et al., 2013; Strickland et al., 2022). These data collectively suggest that if Pamrevlumab can be effectively delivered to the target tissue in the eye, it has the potential to restore normal aqueous outflow dynamics by reversing or preventing abnormal ECM accumulation and tissue stiffening.

In summary, while the repurposing of Pamrevlumab for glaucoma is based on a strong pharmacological rationale and supported by extensive evidence from systemic fibrotic diseases, there remain several key hurdles that need to be addressed. These include confirming target engagement in ocular tissues, optimizing local delivery to overcome ocular barriers, and thoroughly assessing safety within the ocular microenvironment. Nonetheless, given its high specificity, demonstrated safety in other indications, and robust mechanism of inhibiting CTGF-driven fibrosis, Pamrevlumab represents a promising candidate worthy of further investigation as a novel disease-modifying therapy for glaucoma (Hassan et al., 2023; Wallace et al., 2013; Shao et al., 2023).

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of Tranilast as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma.","Proposal for Tranilast.

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of Tranilast as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tranilast, chemically known as N-[3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl]-anthranilic acid, is a synthetic compound originally derived from anthranilic acid derivatives. It was discovered in Japan during the search for novel anti-allergic agents and has been used for decades in Eastern markets. As a member of the anti-allergy and anti-fibrotic drug classes, Tranilast was initially developed for bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis. Over time, its anti-fibrotic properties became evident during studies aimed at inhibiting keloid formation and hypertrophic scarring. This compound is synthesized via chemical modifications that yield its characteristic cinnamoyl-anthranilic acid structure, which confers its ability to modulate inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. Anthranilic acid derivatives as a class have been previously repurposed to treat fibrotic conditions due to their antiproliferative and cytokine-modulating properties (Rogosnitzky, 2012). Their historical use in treating keloids and other fibrotic disorders has set precedent in exploring them for other diseases characterized by aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. In the context of glaucoma, which is characterized by increased trabecular meshwork (TM) stiffness and reduced aqueous humor outflow largely driven by fibrotic remodeling, the use of a drug with anti-fibrotic effects and an established safety record makes Tranilast an attractive candidate (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Tranilast’s initial therapeutic use focused on allergic diseases, and it has been approved for use clinically in Japan and South Korea since the early 1980s. Its ripple effects in fibrotic disorders became apparent in subsequent clinical observations in which manufacturers noted improvements in scar formation, particularly in keloids and hypertrophic scars. In ophthalmology, Tranilast has been applied topically for allergic conjunctivitis and, more recently, as an adjunctive intervention in ocular surgeries such as pterygium excision (Junior, 2015; Choi, 2016). Although Tranilast has not been extensively tested in large-scale clinical trials specifically for primary open-angle glaucoma, preclinical studies and early-phase clinical investigations in ocular fibrotic conditions have documented its inhibitory effects on fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and transformation induced by growth factors. Its capacity to inhibit TGF-β–mediated signaling was initially observed in in vitro models derived from nonocular fibroblasts, and later, similar biochemical properties were demonstrated in some ocular tissues. In animal models, tranilast has been used to prevent postoperative adhesion and scarring following eye surgeries – an application that underscores its potential to modulate fibrotic responses in the eye (Choi, 2016; Junior, 2015). While its use in glaucoma remains exploratory, the success observed in reducing fibrotic changes in conjunctival and pterygium tissues provides a rationale for repurposing it to target similar pathological mechanisms in the trabecular meshwork (Agarwal, 2009).

Mechanism of Action:
Tranilast’s primary mechanism of action is based on its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties through the inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling. At the molecular level, Tranilast has been shown to interfere with both the secretion and downstream signaling of TGF-β. Under normal and pathological states alike, TGF-β is secreted as a latent complex; once activated, it binds to its receptors on target cells and triggers the phosphorylation cascade of receptor-regulated SMAD proteins (especially Smad2 and Smad3). These phosphorylated SMAD proteins then form a complex with SMAD4 and translocate to the nucleus where they induce the transcription of a variety of genes associated with extracellular matrix production, including collagens, fibronectin, and matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors. This cascade is a key driver of tissue fibrosis (Fuchshofer, 2012; Agarwal, 2009).

Tranilast has been documented to inhibit TGF-β release from cells, including fibroblasts, and to reduce TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of SMAD proteins. For example, studies on cultured fibroblasts from pterygium tissues demonstrated that tranilast significantly reduces both cell proliferation and collagen-gel contraction, indicating a direct suppression of TGF-β–mediated fibrotic processes (Isaji, 2000; Junior, 2015). Additionally, biochemical analyses have shown that tranilast can modulate inflammatory mediator release, including interleukins and prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂), which further contributes to its anti-fibrotic capacity by interrupting autocrine loops that perpetuate fibrosis (Capper, 2000).

On a more detailed level, tranilast likely exerts its effects by preventing the transcriptional activation of ECM genes driven by the SMAD complex. Given that aberrant ECM accumulation in the trabecular meshwork is a pivotal contributor to increased outflow resistance and intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma, inhibiting SMAD-mediated gene expression is an attractive therapeutic strategy (Fuchshofer, 2012). In glaucoma models, TGF-β2 specifically has been implicated in increasing ECM deposition in TM cells. The hypothesis is that by reducing TGF-β signaling, tranilast would decrease the production of collagens and fibronectin in the TM, thereby reducing its stiffness and improving aqueous humor outflow (Agarwal, 2009; Hachana, 2022). Moreover, tranilast does not appear to completely abolish collagen synthesis in normal fibroblasts but rather selectively inhibits the exaggerated collagen production seen in pathologic conditions, lending support to its targeted action in diseased tissues without adversely affecting normal tissue homeostasis (Isaji, 2000).

Expected Effect:
Based on the mechanistic profile of tranilast, it is expected that in assays involving trabecular meshwork cells the compound will inhibit the release and downstream signaling of TGF-β. Preclinical studies have shown that TGF-β levels are abnormally elevated in the aqueous humor of glaucoma patients and that TGF-β drives the expression of several fibrotic markers via SMAD signaling, leading to increased ECM deposition, TM stiffness, and, consequently, higher IOP (Fuchshofer, 2012; Agarwal, 2009). Therefore, when applied to TM cells in vitro, tranilast is hypothesized to reduce SMAD-dependent transcription of ECM genes, including those coding for collagens and fibronectin, thereby lowering the fibrotic remodeling in the TM. This reduction in ECM deposition would, in turn, decrease trabecular tissue stiffness, facilitating improved aqueous humor outflow and a subsequent lowering of IOP (Tejwani, 2020; Choudhari, 2022).

In addition to its direct anti-fibrotic effects, tranilast is also expected to diminish the myofibroblast transdifferentiation of TM cells. The transformation of normal TM cells into myofibroblast-like cells, characterized by the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and other contractile proteins, is a critical event in the development of increased TM rigidity. By inhibiting TGF-β–induced signaling, tranilast should reduce the conversion of these cells, thereby maintaining the functional, compliant nature of the TM (Fuchshofer, 2012; Agarwal, 2009). Furthermore, previous studies in related ocular fibrotic models have demonstrated that tranilast decreases TGF-β expression itself, which should further attenuate the positive feedback loops that drive fibrosis in the TM (Junior, 2015; Choi, 2016). Overall, the expected outcome in TM cell-based assays and potentially in in vivo models of glaucoma is a reduction in pro-fibrotic gene expression, ECM deposition, and TM stiffness, all culminating in improved outflow facility and a reduction in intraocular pressure (Tejwani, 2020; Agarwal, 2009).

Overall Evaluation:
Tranilast emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in glaucoma due to its well-documented anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties, coupled with its ability to modulate TGF-β signaling at multiple levels. One of its greatest strengths is its extensive history of clinical use and the established safety profile in ocular and nonocular indications. Its use in treating allergic conditions and as an adjunct in pterygium surgery has provided evidence of both ocular tolerability and its capacity to reduce TGF-β expression and fibrotic tissue remodeling (Junior, 2015; Choi, 2016). This background supports the feasibility of using tranilast to target similar fibrotic mechanisms in the trabecular meshwork, a key pathological event in glaucoma pathogenesis. Moreover, the molecular rationale underlying tranilast’s mechanism of action, namely the inhibition of TGF-β secretion and subsequent SMAD-mediated ECM gene transcription, directly addresses the hypothesized pathophysiology in glaucomatous TM tissues (Fuchshofer, 2012; Agarwal, 2009).

However, there are some weaknesses and gaps that merit further investigation. Despite promising preclinical data in models of ocular fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases, direct evidence of tranilast’s efficacy in reducing intraocular pressure or modulating trabecular meshwork stiffness in glaucoma patients is currently limited. Most of the existing studies have focused on fibrotic responses in pterygium or pulmonary fibrosis models (Kato, 2020; Rogosnitzky, 2012), and while the underlying biology is relevant, the translation to a TM context remains to be fully validated. Additionally, the potential pharmacokinetics and ocular bioavailability of tranilast when delivered to the TM need to be elucidated in further preclinical studies to ensure that sufficient drug concentrations reach the target tissue without adverse effects. It will be important to investigate whether topical or intracameral formulations of tranilast can achieve therapeutic levels in the anterior chamber while maintaining its safety profile (Minami, 2020).

Furthermore, targeting a ubiquitous cytokine like TGF-β comes with inherent challenges, given its broad role in tissue homeostasis and immune regulation. Nonselective inhibition of TGF-β might risk diminishing its physiological functions outside the pathological context, thereby increasing the potential for unintended side effects. This necessitates careful patient selection and dosing strategies to ensure that tranilast’s anti-fibrotic effects are maximized in the TM without compromising TGF-β’s beneficial roles elsewhere (Agarwal, 2009; Hachana, 2022).

In summary, Tranilast represents a compelling candidate for glaucoma therapy based on its mechanistic ability to inhibit TGF-β signaling and downstream SMAD-mediated ECM gene expression. This mechanism is well-aligned with current understandings of trabecular meshwork fibrosis, increased TM stiffness, and subsequent intraocular pressure elevation in glaucoma. Its therapeutic history in treating fibrotic conditions and its favorable safety profile further enhance its appeal. Nevertheless, critical gaps regarding its direct efficacy in glaucoma models and optimal delivery to ocular tissues must be addressed in subsequent preclinical and clinical studies. Overall, further research into tranilast’s pharmacodynamics in TM cells, its bioavailability in anterior segment tissues, and controlled clinical trials in glaucoma patients are warranted to fully assess its potential in lowering IOP and preventing glaucoma progression (Tejwani, 2020; Choudhari, 2022; Rogosnitzky, 2012).

Based on the literature review above, our expert drug development team concludes that tranilast has significant mechanistic and preclinical rationale for repurposing as a treatment for glaucoma. The advantages offered by its TGF-β inhibitory and anti-fibrotic actions strongly support further investigation into its efficacy in reducing trabecular meshwork stiffness and lowering intraocular pressure in glaucomatous eyes. However, careful attention must be paid to formulation, dosing, and controlled clinical evaluation to mitigate potential off-target effects given TGF-β’s ubiquitous role in cell signaling.

Simvastatin.,"Proposal for Simvastatin.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Simvastatin is a member of the statin class of compounds, which are primarily HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Originally derived from natural fermentation products produced by fungi such as Aspergillus terreus, simvastatin was later semi-synthetically modified to improve its potency and pharmacokinetic properties (Kim, 2017). As a lipophilic statin, simvastatin readily crosses cell membranes and has been extensively used for lowering circulating cholesterol levels and reducing cardiovascular risk. Its synthesis involves chemical derivatization of its natural precursor, resulting in a prodrug that is converted in vivo to its active β-hydroxy acid form, which competitively binds the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. Statins as a class have been pivotal in reducing the risk of coronary artery disease through their cholesterol-lowering and pleiotropic effects that include anti-inflammatory and endothelial-protective properties (Wu et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Simvastatin has a long clinical history in the management of hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease. Widely prescribed over several decades, it has established an extensive safety record in systemic use. Despite its primary indication as a lipid-lowering agent, statins have been investigated over the years for their pleiotropic effects, which include anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and antifibrotic actions. Epidemiological and observational studies have noted an association between statin use and a lower risk or slower progression of glaucoma, indicating potential benefits beyond cardiovascular protection (Leung et al., 2010; McGwin et al., 2004). In particular, simvastatin has been questioned as a possible repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma management due to its ability to modulate pathways implicated in the trabecular meshwork function and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling (Talwar et al., 2017). However, a direct clinical trial evaluating simvastatin for glaucoma is still lacking, as underscored by the absence of records on ClinicalTrials.gov for “Simvastatin AND glaucoma” (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Mechanism of Action:
Simvastatin’s primary mechanism of action is the competitive inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. This inhibition leads to a reduction in the synthesis of cholesterol and also suppresses the production of isoprenoid intermediates such as farnesylpyrophosphate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. The depletion of these isoprenoids is significant beyond cholesterol lowering because these intermediates are required for the post-translational prenylation of small GTP-binding proteins, notably RhoA (Von Zee et al., 2009). Prenylation is essential for the proper localization and activation of RhoA on the plasma membrane where it triggers downstream signaling cascades including the activation of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK). ROCK activation is a crucial mediator of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, stress fiber formation, and cellular contractility. In trabecular meshwork (TM) cells, overactivation of the Rho/ROCK pathway contributes to increased cellular stiffness and aberrant extracellular matrix deposition, both of which reduce aqueous humor outflow and lead to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) – the major risk factor for glaucoma (Yoo et al., 2023; Kim, 2017).

Additionally, simvastatin’s ability to inhibit RhoA prenylation confers an antifibrotic effect by reducing the notion that non-prenylated, cytosolic Rho proteins cannot effectively engage their downstream targets. The result is a decrease in ROCK-mediated phosphorylation of myosin light chain, which in turn reduces actomyosin contractility and stress fiber formation in TM cells (Yoo et al., 2023). This molecular activity positions simvastatin to potentially restore a more relaxed, less fibrotic state in the trabecular meshwork, thereby increasing aqueous humor outflow and reducing IOP (Wu et al., 2020). These combined biochemical actions underpin the hypothesis that simvastatin could modulate key pathogenic mechanisms in glaucoma, such as exaggerated ECM synthesis and trabecular meshwork contractility.

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay, simvastatin is expected to demonstrate a reduction in trabecular meshwork cell contractility, a decrease in stress fiber formation, and a concomitant reduction in ECM deposition. The hypothesis posits that by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, simvastatin will reduce the prenylation and subsequent activation of RhoA. This effect should lead to a decline in ROCK pathway activation; in turn, there will be decreased phosphorylation of myosin light chain and a reduction in the formation of actin stress fibers (Yoo et al., 2023). As a consequence, TM cells are likely to exhibit a less contractile, more compliant phenotype, which is conducive to improved aqueous humor outflow and, thereby, a reduction in IOP (Kim, 2017). Additionally, the antifibrotic effects expected from simvastatin may include a reduction in the synthesis and deposition of ECM proteins such as fibronectin—proteins that contribute to the increased outflow resistance observed in glaucomatous eyes (Yoo et al., 2023). Moreover, given that genes encoding components of the Rho/ROCK pathway and associated ECM proteins are expressed in trabecular meshwork cells, simvastatin’s mechanism is directly relevant to the pathology observed in these cells (Von Zee et al., 2009). The overall expected effect in an in vitro assay would therefore be measurable as a decreased cellular contractility, reduced ECM protein expression, and potentially enhanced permeability of the trabecular meshwork, all of which are anticipated to facilitate better aqueous humor drainage (Talwar et al., 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
Simvastatin emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of glaucoma based on a convergence of biochemical rationale, epidemiological associations, and established systemic safety. One of the primary strengths of simvastatin is its well-documented mechanism of inhibiting the mevalonate pathway, which is not only central to cholesterol synthesis but also critically involved in the post-translational modification of small GTPases such as RhoA. By reducing prenylation, simvastatin indirectly attenuates the Rho/ROCK pathway, a key regulator of trabecular meshwork cell contractility and ECM remodeling—both of which are pathological in glaucoma (Yoo et al., 2023; Von Zee et al., 2009). This mechanistic specificity supports the hypothesis that simvastatin can enhance aqueous outflow and reduce intraocular pressure by alleviating the fibrotic and contractile state of the trabecular meshwork.

Epidemiologically, several large-scale observational studies and systematic reviews have noted that statin use is associated with a modest reduction in the risk of developing glaucomatous conditions, as well as with slower disease progression, particularly in normal tension glaucoma cases (Leung et al., 2010; McGwin et al., 2004; Talwar et al., 2017). Although these studies do not provide direct causal evidence—and they are often limited by confounding variables—the consistency of the association across populations enhances the plausibility of a protective role for simvastatin in glaucoma. Furthermore, simvastatin’s extensive safety profile in millions of patients worldwide provides additional reassurance regarding its systemic tolerability, although the translation of systemic safety to ocular-specific applications will require further targeted investigations (McGwin et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2020).

However, there are some notable weaknesses and challenges. First, despite promising mechanistic data and epidemiological associations, there is a lack of direct clinical trial evidence specifically testing simvastatin in the context of glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov). This gap poses a significant hurdle, as the translation from observational findings and preclinical in vitro data to actual clinical efficacy in reducing intraocular pressure and halting glaucoma progression remains uncertain. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic properties of simvastatin when administered systemically may not ensure sufficient ocular penetration or adequate concentration at the trabecular meshwork, which might necessitate alternative delivery strategies (Unknown Reference).

Another consideration is the multifactorial nature of glaucoma itself. While the hypothesis is focused on the antifibrotic and Rho/ROCK inhibitory effects of simvastatin, glaucoma is a complex disease involving vascular dysregulation, neurodegeneration, and genetic predispositions that might not be fully addressed by targeting a single pathway. Therefore, simvastatin might be more effective as an adjunct therapy rather than as a monotherapy. Its beneficial effects on ocular blood flow and potential neuroprotective properties—as suggested by some studies—could complement existing intraocular pressure-lowering treatments (Leung et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2020).

In summary, simvastatin offers several attractive features for repurposing in glaucoma therapy. Its molecular action on the HMG-CoA reductase pathway—and the downstream inhibition of RhoA prenylation and ROCK activation—directly targets pathological changes in the trabecular meshwork that contribute to elevated intraocular pressure. Epidemiological studies provide supportive, albeit indirect, evidence of statins’ protective effects on glaucoma incidence and progression. Additionally, the long-standing clinical use of simvastatin in cardiovascular disease, with its robust safety profile, adds to its appeal as a low-cost, widely available therapeutic candidate. On the other hand, the absence of dedicated clinical trials evaluating simvastatin in glaucoma patients, along with potential issues regarding ocular drug delivery and the multifactorial etiology of glaucoma, are important weaknesses that must be addressed in future research (Fakhri et al., 2024; Talwar et al., 2017; McCann et al., 2016). Overall, while further preclinical experiments and well-designed clinical trials are warranted to confirm efficacy, optimize dosing, and develop appropriate delivery methods, simvastatin shows significant promise as a repurposed drug candidate for glaucoma. Its ability to modulate key cellular pathways implicated in trabecular meshwork dysfunction, combined with supportive epidemiological data and an excellent safety record, makes it an attractive candidate for future drug development initiatives (Leung et al., 2010; Yoo et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2020).

"SS-31 (Elamipretide), a mitochondrial membrane‐targeting peptide.","Proposal for SS-31 (Elamipretide), a mitochondrial membrane‐targeting peptide.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SS-31, also known as Elamipretide, is a synthetic tetrapeptide originally discovered and subsequently optimized from the Szeto–Schiller peptide class. It consists of a sequence with alternating aromatic and cationic residues—typically represented as H-D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH₂—which confers a net positive charge at physiological pH and enables selective mitochondrial targeting (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015). The peptide's design allows it to rapidly penetrate cell membranes without requiring energy-dependent transport and preferentially accumulates in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) by binding specifically to cardiolipin, an anionic phospholipid that is unique to mitochondria (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Mitchell et al., 2022). Synthetic modifications, such as incorporation of 2,6-dimethyltyrosine (Dmt) in place of tyrosine and C-terminal amidation, enhance both its metabolic stability and its scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to naturally occurring antioxidants (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Stefaniak et al., 2024). This class of mitochondria‐targeting peptides has been broadly investigated for its ability to ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction, with previous applications in conditions such as cardiac ischemia, cellular aging, and neurodegenerative diseases (Chhetri & Gueven, 2016; Nashine, 2021), establishing a strong rationale for repurposing in other disorders linked to mitochondrial impairment including glaucoma.

Therapeutic History:
SS-31 has an extensive preclinical and clinical history centered around its role as a mitochondrial protective agent. Its therapeutic development has spanned multiple disease indications where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role. In preclinical models, SS-31 has demonstrated efficacy in improving mitochondrial bioenergetics, reducing excessive ROS production, and preventing cell apoptosis in contexts ranging from age‐related decline in visual function to myocardial ischemia‐reperfusion injury (Alam, Douglas, & Prusky, 2020; Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015). Clinically, SS-31 is in various stages of investigation for mitochondrial‐related disorders; it has been tested in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for conditions such as primary mitochondrial myopathy and age‐related macular degeneration, showing promising safety profiles and target engagement (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015, 2022). Although direct clinical studies in glaucoma remain limited, several studies in animal models have indicated that SS-31 can protect retinal cells from oxidative stress and support overall retinal function (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Alam, Douglas, & Prusky, 2020). Moreover, related research in diabetic retinopathy models and neurodegenerative conditions highlights the potential of SS-31 to prevent apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), a key pathological hallmark in glaucoma (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Jutley et al., 2017). The overall body of work on this drug candidate and similar mitochondria‐targeting peptides substantiates its repurposing potential for ocular diseases sharing a mitochondrial pathology, including glaucoma (Chhetri & Gueven, 2016; Nashine, 2021; Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
SS-31 exerts its effects through a multifaceted mechanism of mitochondrial protection that is now well characterized at the molecular level. Its primary mode of action involves a high-affinity binding to cardiolipin in the IMM. This binding stabilizes mitochondrial cristae structure and organizes electron transport chain (ETC) complexes into supercomplexes, thereby enhancing electron flux and improving ATP production (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Mitchell et al., 2021). By binding cardiolipin, SS-31 not only prevents its peroxidation—a process that normally leads to increased ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction—but also inhibits cytochrome c peroxidase activity, thereby preventing cytochrome c release and apoptosis via caspase activation (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Chhetri & Gueven, 2016).

In addition to these antioxidant effects, SS-31 modulates the electrostatics at the mitochondrial membrane surface and preserves the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), which is critical for maintaining normal mitochondrial function under stress conditions (Mitchell et al., 2022; Tamucci, Alder, & May, 2023). These properties allow SS-31 to effectively reduce the intracellular accumulation of ROS without interfering with the normal function of the ETC, thereby providing a targeted intervention upstream of pathological cascades involving TGF-β signaling. The reduction in oxidative stress is particularly relevant because excessive ROS can trigger profibrotic signaling cascades, including those mediated by TGF-β, leading to extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and a contractile phenotype in trabecular meshwork cells (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Forini et al., 2020). Moreover, research indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction is a central regulator of RGC death in glaucoma and that protecting mitochondrial integrity can preserve cellular function and viability (Muench et al., 2021; Jutley et al., 2017). Importantly, the ubiquitous expression of cardiolipin in mitochondria implies that SS-31 will target trabecular meshwork cells as effectively as it does neurons, supporting its potential role in preserving ocular function by mitigating mitochondrial oxidative stress.

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, SS-31 is expected to preserve mitochondrial function in trabecular meshwork cells by directly reducing levels of ROS and preventing mitochondrial dysfunction. By scavenging ROS and stabilizing cardiolipin, SS-31 should interrupt the cascade of events that normally leads to mitochondrial permeability transition, cytochrome c release, and subsequent apoptosis (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Mitchell et al., 2021). This mitochondrial protection is hypothesized to have a downstream effect on cellular signaling pathways, particularly TGF-β signaling, which is known to be activated by oxidative stress and is a critical driver of ECM deposition and fibrosis in the trabecular meshwork (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Alam, Douglas, & Prusky, 2020).

In the proposed assay, a reduction in oxidative stress markers and preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential would be key readouts, correlating with decreased activation of TGF-β cascades. The downstream impact should include a reduction in ECM protein deposition and a decrease in the contractile phenotype typically associated with glaucomatous changes in the trabecular meshwork (Chhetri & Gueven, 2016; Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015). Additionally, there is strong evidence from ocular studies that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to RGC apoptosis; thus, by preserving mitochondrial function in retinal and trabecular meshwork cells, SS-31 is expected to offer neuroprotective benefits that may slow or prevent the progression of glaucoma (Alam, Douglas, & Prusky, 2020; Jutley et al., 2017). Expression of mitochondrial target proteins, including cardiolipin, is well-documented in both RGCs and trabecular meshwork cells, further confirming that the drug’s targets are present in the cell types that are critical in glaucoma pathophysiology (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Chhetri & Gueven, 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, SS-31 presents a compelling therapeutic candidate for glaucoma due to its robust mitochondrial protective properties, favorable safety profile from existing clinical data, and its well-defined mechanism of action that directly addresses the upstream pathological events leading to oxidative stress and TGF-β activation. The strengths of SS-31 include its proven ability to stabilize mitochondrial membranes via specific interaction with cardiolipin, its efficient cellular uptake and mitochondrial targeting, and its broad efficacy in preclinical models of mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Mitchell et al., 2022). Additionally, its ability to reduce ROS and preserve mitochondrial bioenergetics directly implicates it in the suppression of profibrotic TGF-β cascades, a central element in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous damage to trabecular meshwork cells (Alam, Douglas, & Prusky, 2020; Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015).

However, the candidate’s weaknesses lie primarily in the current lack of direct clinical studies in glaucoma patients and limited data on its specific effects on trabecular meshwork cells and TGF-β signaling modulation within ocular tissues. While there is promising evidence from studies involving diabetic retinopathy models and general mitochondrial neuroprotection in the eye (Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015; Alam, Douglas, & Prusky, 2020), more focused research is needed to substantiate its efficacy specifically in the context of glaucoma. Furthermore, while existing clinical trials have demonstrated its safety and tolerability in other conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015, 2022), adapting the systemic delivery of SS-31 to an ocular application (e.g., topical administration) may require additional formulation development to ensure adequate bioavailability in the target tissue.

In conclusion, SS-31 (Elamipretide) stands out as a promising mitochondrial membrane-targeting peptide with significant potential to preserve trabecular meshwork cell function by reducing oxidative stress and subsequent activation of deleterious TGF-β signaling cascades. Its well-characterized mechanism of binding cardiolipin, coupled with robust preclinical evidence and an excellent safety profile in clinical trials for other mitochondrial diseases, supports its repurposing for glaucoma therapy. However, further targeted studies, including direct evaluations in glaucoma models and pharmacokinetic studies focused on ocular delivery, are necessary to fully validate its therapeutic potential for glaucoma (Chhetri & Gueven, 2016; Nashine, 2021; Ling, Yu, & Chao, 2015).

Atorvastatin.,"Proposal for Atorvastatin.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Atorvastatin is a synthetic member of the statin class of drugs originally derived from fungal metabolites and later modified into potent HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitors. As a cholesterol‐lowering agent, it was developed by chemical optimization to enhance potency and tissue penetration, and it is characterized by its greater lipophilicity compared with some other statins. Statins, as a class, have been conventionally used for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases through their ability to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis; however, over the past two decades mounting evidence has highlighted a series of pleiotropic effects that extend beyond lipid lowering. These include anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions, as well as the inhibition of protein prenylation processes that affect small GTPases such as RhoA. The repurposing hypothesis for atorvastatin in glaucoma is based on these latter biochemical properties, which have the potential to modify trabecular meshwork (TM) cell function by decreasing RhoA prenylation and subsequent Rho‐associated protein kinase (ROCK) activity, thereby mitigating excessive contractility and fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation that hinder aqueous humor outflow (Cai et al., 2015; Liao et al., 2007).

Therapeutic History:
Atorvastatin has an extensive clinical history as a frontline therapeutic agent for hypercholesterolemia and related cardiovascular conditions. Its efficacy in lowering low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular events has been demonstrated in numerous high‐quality clinical trials, and its favorable safety profile has established it as a staple in cardiovascular risk management (Nohria et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2015). Biochemically, atorvastatin’s ability to inhibit the mevalonate pathway not only reduces cholesterol levels but also decreases the synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates necessary for the post‐translational prenylation of small GTPases, a mechanism responsible for its pleiotropic properties. Although atorvastatin has not been formally evaluated in registered clinical trials specifically targeting glaucoma management (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), observational studies and meta‐analyses have reported epidemiological signals suggesting that statin use may be associated with a reduced risk of primary open‐angle glaucoma (Talwar et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2022). Preclinical studies derived from similar statin compounds—such as simvastatin and lovastatin, which share mechanistic similarities with atorvastatin—have demonstrated the capacity to modulate trabecular meshwork cell function, including attenuation of fibrotic ECM production and modulation of cell contractility. This collective body of literature supports exploring atorvastatin as a repurposed candidate for glaucoma through its modulation of RhoA prenylation and ROCK signaling pathways (Kim et al., 2017; Rupérez et al., 2007).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, atorvastatin exerts its primary pharmacological action by competitively inhibiting HMG‐CoA reductase, the rate‐limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. This inhibition results in the decreased production of mevalonate and its downstream isoprenoid intermediates, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and, critically, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate is required for the post‐translational prenylation of small GTPases including RhoA. Prenylation is essential for RhoA to attach to cell membranes where it becomes fully active. When atorvastatin reduces the availability of GGPP, RhoA remains unprenylated, resulting in impaired membrane localization and diminished activation (Rikitake & Liao, 2005; Liao, 2010).

RhoA, when activated, stimulates its downstream effector ROCK (Rho‐associated protein kinase), which plays a central role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, cellular contractility, and extracellular matrix production. In vascular and ocular tissues, ROCK‐mediated phosphorylation of substrates such as myosin light chain (MLC) and myosin‐binding subunit (MBS) leads to increased actomyosin contractility and promotes the synthesis and deposition of fibrotic ECM proteins that can increase tissue stiffness. In the trabecular meshwork, these processes are critical because increased cellular contractility and ECM accumulation contribute to higher outflow resistance, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), and ultimately glaucoma progression (Nohria et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2015).

Moreover, statins have been shown to affect transforming growth factor‐beta (TGF‐β) signaling pathways. TGF‐β, particularly TGF‐β2, has been implicated in the pathological remodeling of the optic nerve head and trabecular meshwork, and studies have indicated that statin treatment can inhibit TGF‐β2‐mediated Smad2/3 activation and subsequent ECM production in ocular cells (Kim et al., 2017). This dual action on both cytoskeletal contractility via RhoA/ROCK and on ECM modulation via TGF‐β signaling provides a strong biochemical rationale for the potential use of atorvastatin in glaucoma.

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the hypothesis is that atorvastatin will reduce RhoA prenylation in trabecular meshwork cells, resulting in decreased ROCK activity. This reduction in ROCK-driven contractility is expected to manifest as a relaxation of TM cells. By reducing cellular contractility, there should be a concomitant decrease in the production and deposition of fibrotic extracellular matrix components, which in turn would decrease the rigidity of the TM and improve aqueous humor outflow. The net effect of these changes would be a lowering of intraocular pressure, which is a primary therapeutic target in glaucoma management (Wang et al., 2024; Cai et al., 2015).

In more detail, the TM is known to express key components of the RhoA/ROCK signaling cascade, and multiple studies have demonstrated that inhibition of ROCK can lead to increased outflow facility and IOP reduction. In vitro studies using other statins such as simvastatin and lovastatin have shown modulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics and extracellular matrix remodeling in TM cells (Villarreal et al., 2014). Given that atorvastatin is more lipophilic than some other statins, it may possess superior capacity for ocular tissue penetration, potentially enhancing its local effects in the TM. Additionally, the overall favorable safety record of atorvastatin further supports the hypothesis that repurposing it for glaucoma could be achieved with minimal adverse risk, at least in the context of a well‐controlled therapeutic window (Talwar et al., 2017; Liao et al., 2007).

The expected outcomes in in vitro assays would include measurable decreases in markers of RhoA activity (such as reduced membrane association of RhoA) and decreased phosphorylation levels of ROCK substrates such as MLC and MBS in trabecular meshwork cells. Functionally, these molecular changes should correlate with decreased cell stiffness and a reduction in ECM protein expression—key determinants of aqueous outflow resistance (Rupérez et al., 2007; Nohria et al., 2009). In animal models of glaucoma, one would anticipate observing a reduction in IOP following topical or systemically administered atorvastatin, although such studies remain to be specifically performed. Nonetheless, the preclinical biochemical rationale strongly supports this treatment paradigm.

Overall Evaluation:
Atorvastatin emerges as a promising drug candidate for repurposing in glaucoma based on several lines of evidence from the biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature. Its well‐established history as a cholesterol‐lowering agent with a robust safety profile, coupled with its documented pleiotropic effects on RhoA prenylation and the downstream ROCK pathway, provides a solid mechanistic basis for its potential application in glaucoma therapy. The strengths of atorvastatin as a repurposed candidate include its high lipophilicity, which may enhance ocular tissue penetration and enable effective modulation of TM cell function, its broad and well‐characterized clinical use history in cardiovascular diseases implying extensive safety data, and compelling preclinical data supporting the hypothesis that inhibition of RhoA prenylation can relax TM cells and reduce ECM deposition (Cai et al., 2015; Nohria et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2024). Furthermore, epidemiological studies hinting at a correlation between statin use and a reduced risk of open‐angle glaucoma add additional support for pursuing this repurposing strategy (Talwar et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2022).

However, several challenges and potential weaknesses must be addressed. First, despite encouraging biochemical and observational evidence, there remains a lack of formal clinical trial data evaluating atorvastatin specifically for glaucoma treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), meaning that its efficacy in reducing IOP via TM modulation in humans has not been directly proven. Second, the precise dosing regimen and route of administration required to achieve adequate drug levels in the trabecular meshwork without eliciting systemic adverse effects will need careful optimization. Although systemic atorvastatin therapy is widely tolerated, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters in ocular tissues are less well understood, and high local concentrations might be necessary to inhibit RhoA prenylation effectively in the TM (Liao et al., 2007; Rupérez et al., 2007). Third, while the inhibition of RhoA prenylation is a promising mechanism, the TM is a complex tissue with multiple interacting signaling pathways, and compensatory mechanisms may mitigate the expected benefits. It will therefore be crucial to explore combination strategies or optimized formulations (e.g., topical delivery systems) that maximize local drug exposure while minimizing off-target effects. Additionally, the heterogeneity within glaucoma patients, in terms of TM pathology and genetic predisposition, may influence the responsiveness to a repurposed atorvastatin treatment regimen (Kim, 2017; Wang et al., 2024).

In summary, the converging evidence from molecular studies demonstrates that atorvastatin’s inhibition of HMG‐CoA reductase disrupts the prenylation of RhoA, leading to diminished ROCK activity, reduced cellular contractility, and a decrease in the production of fibrotic ECM components in trabecular meshwork cells. These effects are precisely aligned with the pathological features of glaucoma, where increased TM stiffness and aberrant ECM deposition contribute to impaired aqueous humor outflow and elevated intraocular pressure. Although clinical research directly addressing the application of atorvastatin for glaucoma is currently sparse, the mechanistic rationale combined with supportive epidemiological observations renders it a highly promising candidate for further preclinical and clinical investigation. The strengths of atorvastatin include its established safety profile, potential for enhanced ocular penetration due to its lipophilicity, and a well‐defined mechanism that addresses key pathogenic processes in the TM. Conversely, the weaknesses and challenges lie in the absence of targeted clinical data, the need for precise dosing and delivery optimization, and the possibility that complex TM biology may require multi‐targeted therapeutic approaches. On balance, the repurposing of atorvastatin for glaucoma merits serious consideration and warrants the initiation of mechanistic in vitro studies in human TM cells, followed by in vivo animal model testing and eventually pilot clinical trials to rigorously assess its efficacy in lowering intraocular pressure and altering disease progression (Nohria et al., 2009; Talwar et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2022).

Galunisertib (LY2157299).,"Proposal for Galunisertib (LY2157299).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Galunisertib (LY2157299) is a synthetically derived, small‐molecule inhibitor designed to target the transforming growth factor‐beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway with a high degree of specificity. It was developed using structure‐based drug design approaches aimed at inhibiting the kinase activity of the TGF-β receptor type I (TGF-βRI), also referred to as ALK5. Galunisertib belongs to the class of TGF-β receptor kinase inhibitors, a group of compounds originally developed to intervene in pathologic fibrosis, cancer progression, and other disorders characterized by dysregulated TGF-β signaling. The design of galunisertib hinges on its ability to bind competitively to the ATP pocket of TGF-βRI’s intracellular kinase domain. This binding prevents autophosphorylation of the receptor and blocks subsequent phosphorylation of downstream signal transducers such as SMAD2 and SMAD3. Early compounds in this class, exemplified by SB431542, demonstrated that selective inhibition of TGF-βRI could be achieved, although many were limited to preclinical investigations. Galunisertib represents an evolution of this concept and has been optimized with improvements in oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties (Lahn et al., 2015; Kaminska & Cyranowski, 2020). In addition, its chemical synthesis and optimization have been guided by extensive preclinical work demonstrating potent and selective inhibition of TGF-β signaling, which has significant implications for conditions driven by fibrotic remodeling. The decision to focus on a TGF-β receptor kinase inhibitor is based on the broad role of TGF-β in mediating fibrosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition across a range of tissues, a concept that has been extensively validated in cancer and fibrotic diseases (Danielpour, 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Galunisertib has most notably been evaluated in oncology settings over the past decade, with a series of clinical trials ranging from Phase I dose-escalation studies to more advanced Phase II trials in cancer patients. Initially tested in malignancies such as malignant glioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, metastatic breast cancer, and castration-resistant prostate cancer, galunisertib showed the capacity to inhibit the TGF-β–mediated fibrotic stroma, reduce tumor-associated immunosuppression, and modulate cytokine expression. In these settings, its clinical development was designed around an intermittent dosing schedule (typically 14 days on followed by 14 days off) to mitigate potential toxicities, such as cardiotoxicity, that have been associated with continuous TGF-β blockade (Lahn et al., 2015). Although galunisertib’s use in glaucoma has not been clinically assessed, the underlying mechanism—targeting TGF-βRI to suppress downstream fibrosis—has been implicated in ocular disorders. In primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), TGF-β2 is elevated in the aqueous humor and is known to promote fibrosis in the trabecular meshwork (TM) by upregulating ECM gene transcription and enhancing actomyosin contractility (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Belmares et al., 2018). The fact that TGF-β receptor kinases have been successfully targeted in systemic fibrotic and oncologic conditions makes galunisertib an attractive candidate for repurposing. Recent clinical trial searches (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) have revealed a growing translational interest in testing TGF-β inhibitors for glaucoma, particularly focusing on fibrotic ocular phenotypes. This evolving body of evidence from preclinical and clinical oncology studies provides a strong rationale for evaluating galunisertib in a new therapeutic context such as glaucoma.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, TGF-β signaling is initiated by the binding of one of the TGF-β isoforms (TGF-β1, TGF-β2, or TGF-β3) to TGF-β receptor type II (TGF-βRII) on the cell membrane. This ligand-receptor interaction results in the recruitment and hetero-oligomerization with TGF-β receptor type I (TGF-βRI/ALK5), forming a functional receptor complex. Subsequent phosphorylation of TGF-βRI by TGF-βRII triggers an intracellular cascade whereby TGF-βRI phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMAD proteins (R-SMADs), primarily SMAD2 and SMAD3. These phosphorylated SMADs then form complexes with SMAD4 and translocate into the nucleus where they regulate the transcription of genes responsible for ECM production (including collagens and fibronectin) and proteins involved in actomyosin contractility (Lahn et al., 2015; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012). Galunisertib exerts its pharmacological effect by binding directly to the ATP-binding pocket within the kinase domain of TGF-βRI. This occupation of the ATP-binding site prevents the catalytic activity necessary for receptor autophosphorylation and subsequent SMAD phosphorylation. As a result, galunisertib effectively halts both the canonical SMAD-dependent pathway and affects noncanonical TGF-β signaling pathways such as those mediated by MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and Rho-like GTPases (Mitra et al., 2020; Hachana & Larrivée, 2022). These pathways are critically involved in cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which are key drivers of fibrotic remodeling. The inhibitory effect of galunisertib is thus focused on a central node of the TGF-β signaling network, allowing for targeted suppression of pathological fibrosis while ideally preserving other essential cellular functions. Laboratory studies in oncology have demonstrated that treatment with galunisertib reduces phosphorylated SMAD2 levels, which correlates with a decrease in the transcription of pro-fibrotic genes (Lahn et al., 2015; Ogata et al., 2024). This mechanistic insight underpins the hypothesis that using galunisertib could downregulate fibrotic gene expression in trabecular meshwork cells and thereby improve the outflow of aqueous humor in patients with glaucoma.

Expected Effect:
In the pathogenesis of glaucoma, particularly POAG, an overactive TGF-β2 signaling cascade within the trabecular meshwork leads to excessive deposition of ECM components (collagen, fibronectin, etc.) and elevation of actomyosin contractility. These changes cause stiffening of the trabecular meshwork and reduced aqueous humor outflow, which ultimately elevates intraocular pressure (IOP) (Belmares et al., 2018; Callaghan et al., 2022). The expectation from applying galunisertib in this setting is that its selective inhibition of TGF-βRI will lead to a significant reduction in SMAD2/3 phosphorylation in trabecular meshwork cells. This should, in turn, decrease transcription of fibrotic ECM genes and reduce actomyosin contractility. The net effect would be the softening of trabecular meshwork tissue, restoration of normal aqueous humor outflow, and a concomitant reduction in IOP. Preclinical evidence from tissue models has shown that when TGF-β2 levels are experimentally elevated, trabecular meshwork remodeling and IOP increase occur. Conversely, approaches that block TGF-β signaling—using neutralizing antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, or small molecule inhibitors—have been associated with decreased fibrotic changes in ocular tissues and improved outflow facility (Hachana & Larrivée, 2022; Parichatikanond et al., 2020). Furthermore, clinical data from oncology trials of galunisertib have demonstrated that its use results in measurable reductions in phosphorylated SMAD2, providing a translational biomarker that supports its antifibrotic efficacy (Lahn et al., 2015; Ogata et al., 2024). While direct studies in glaucoma models are not yet available, the comprehensive pharmacological data support the hypothesis that galunisertib would reduce trabecular meshwork fibrosis, lower IOP, and thereby slow or halt the progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

Overall Evaluation:
From an expert drug development perspective, galunisertib represents a compelling candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic strategy for glaucoma. One of its key strengths lies in its selective inhibition of TGF-βRI kinase activity, which has been thoroughly validated in preclinical and clinical settings in oncology and systemic fibrotic diseases (Lahn et al., 2015; Mitra et al., 2020). By targeting the ATP-binding site of TGF-βRI, galunisertib reliably prevents the phosphorylation and activation of SMAD2/3, thereby interfering with the transcriptional regulation of genes that drive pathological ECM deposition and actomyosin contractility. This mechanistic specificity is directly aligned with the pathological processes known to increase intraocular pressure in glaucoma (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Belmares et al., 2018).

Another significant strength is the robust clinical development history of galunisertib in oncology. Extensive Phase I and Phase II clinical trials have established its human PK/PD profile and highlighted its tolerability when administered intermittently. This body of data not only provides substantial evidence of its safety in humans but also offers critical insights into dosing regimens that might be adapted for ocular administration. Its oral bioavailability is advantageous for systemic treatment; however, this characteristic will need to be re-evaluated for ocular delivery where localized high concentrations in the trabecular meshwork are necessary. Formulation strategies such as topical eye drops, sustained-release implants, or intracameral injections may need to be optimized to ensure adequate tissue penetration without eliciting significant systemic exposure (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

While the engineered specificity of galunisertib reduces the risk of off-target effects, one potential limitation is the pleiotropic role of TGF-β in normal cellular and immune functions. TGF-β is important for maintaining tissue homeostasis and regulating wound healing. Thus, prolonged or excessive inhibition of TGF-β signaling in the eye could theoretically impair normal reparative processes or lead to unforeseen side effects. Nonetheless, the intermittent dosing regimens that have been effective in oncology might mitigate these risks in an ocular application (Lahn et al., 2015).

Moreover, although there is a solid mechanistic rationale and substantial supporting data from preclinical and clinical research in other indications, direct evidence for the efficacy of galunisertib in glaucoma is currently lacking. This gap underscores the need for targeted preclinical studies using ocular models, such as ex vivo perfused anterior segment organ cultures and in vivo animal models, to evaluate its effects specifically on trabecular meshwork fibrosis and IOP regulation. The promising data from other fibrotic conditions and ocular surface disorders, where TGF-β signaling has been successfully modulated, provide a strong impetus for these investigations (Hachana & Larrivée, 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In addition to the efficacy considerations, formulation and delivery challenges represent a critical translational hurdle. The systemic dosing regimens established in oncology may not translate directly into ophthalmic use due to differences in pharmacokinetics and tissue barriers in the eye. Innovative drug delivery platforms specifically designed for ocular therapeutics will be key to enabling galunisertib to reach and exert its effects within the trabecular meshwork at therapeutic concentrations.

Overall, the extensive preclinical data and the strong clinical safety and PK/PD profiles of galunisertib position it as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in glaucoma therapy. Its mechanism—targeted inhibition of TGF-β receptor type I kinase, resulting in reduced SMAD2/3 activation and subsequent downregulation of fibrotic gene expression—addresses the fundamental pathological processes that contribute to trabecular meshwork fibrosis and elevated intraocular pressure. If the challenges associated with ocular drug delivery can be overcome, galunisertib has the potential to offer a disease-modifying treatment option for glaucoma that moves beyond traditional symptomatic IOP-lowering therapies (Lahn et al., 2015; Ogata et al., 2024).

Given these considerations, the next critical steps would include:
1. Conducting detailed preclinical studies in ex vivo and in vivo models of glaucoma to establish the efficacy of galunisertib in reducing TM fibrosis and lowering IOP.
2. Developing and optimizing ocular-specific formulations, whether topical or via sustained-release delivery systems, to achieve significant drug concentrations in the trabecular meshwork without incurring systemic side effects.
3. Designing early-phase clinical trials that incorporate biomarkers for TGF-β signaling (e.g., phospho-SMAD2 levels) in aqueous humor and trabecular meshwork tissue to establish target engagement and define the therapeutic window in the ocular context.

In conclusion, the repurposing of galunisertib for glaucoma is scientifically well-founded based on its molecular mechanism, comprehensive safety data from oncology trials, and the established role of TGF-β in TM fibrosis. Despite challenges related to targeted delivery and the need for ocular-specific efficacy data, galunisertib’s mode of action offers a precise anti-fibrotic approach that could restore outflow facility and reduce intraocular pressure. The convergence of evidence from biochemical, clinical, and translational studies strongly supports advancing galunisertib into dedicated ophthalmic investigations, which may ultimately pave the way for a novel, disease-modifying treatment for glaucoma patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Hachana & Larrivée, 2022; Parichatikanond et al., 2020).

"MitoQ, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant.","Proposal for MitoQ, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MitoQ is a synthetic, mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant that was developed through the conjugation of the naturally occurring antioxidant ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10) to the lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) cation. This modification was designed to exploit the high negative membrane potential of mitochondria, leading to an accumulation of MitoQ in the mitochondrial matrix at concentrations hundreds of times greater than those in the cytosol. The TPP⁺ moiety serves as a carrier enabling the compound to cross phospholipid membranes with high efficiency, while the ubiquinone portion functions as a redox‐active antioxidant. As a member of the mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant class, MitoQ is conceptually related to other TPP‐conjugated molecules such as SkQ1 and MitoTEMPO; these compounds have been primarily used to counteract oxidative stress in tissues where mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a pivotal role in the pathology of disease (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Broome et al., 2018).

Therapeutic History:
MitoQ has been evaluated in multiple preclinical and clinical studies addressing conditions principally linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive ROS production. In clinical settings, MitoQ has been administered to patients with diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and chronic hepatitis C, and it has been further investigated in trials involving vascular dysfunction and aging‐related decline. In these studies, chronic oral supplementation with MitoQ—typically in doses around 20 mg per day—has been shown to improve endothelial function, reduce markers of oxidative stress, and enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics, with an overall favorable safety profile (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Broome et al., 2018). Although no direct clinical studies have yet evaluated MitoQ for glaucoma per se, several preclinical investigations have focused on the effects of mitochondrial‐targeted antioxidants in ocular tissues. Notably, studies conducted using human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells have demonstrated that mitochondrial‐targeted antioxidants can attenuate TGF-β2–mediated signaling which is a well-known driver of fibrosis in the TM (Rao et al., 2019; Buffault et al., 2020). These findings provide a rationale that the repurposing of MitoQ for glaucoma is both mechanistically plausible and translationally attractive, given the manifold evidence that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction underpin the initiation of fibrotic cascades via TGF-β activation in several tissues (Rao et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
MitoQ’s mechanism of action is rooted in its selective accumulation within mitochondria due to the TPP⁺ moiety, which is driven by the strong negative mitochondrial membrane potential (typically between −150 mV and −180 mV). Once within the mitochondrial matrix, MitoQ is reduced by components of the electron transport chain—specifically complex II (succinate dehydrogenase)—into its active antioxidant form, MitoQH₂. In this reduced form, MitoQ is capable of scavenging various reactive oxygen species, including superoxide and peroxynitrite, and it prevents lipid peroxidation by neutralizing free radicals in close proximity to the inner mitochondrial membrane (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Broome et al., 2018).

At the molecular level, the antioxidant action of MitoQ involves a cyclical redox reaction. MitoQH₂, once formed, reacts with mitochondrial ROS and becomes oxidized back to the ubiquinone form; it is then continuously recycled by the respiratory chain. This “rechargeable” nature means that MitoQ can provide sustained protection against oxidative insults without being depleted rapidly, making it more effective than conventional antioxidants that lack such targeting or recycling capabilities. In the context of glaucoma, oxidative stress in trabecular meshwork cells is known to activate latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), thereby triggering downstream pro-fibrotic signaling cascades including the canonical SMAD pathway as well as noncanonical pathways involving RhoA/ROCK. TGF-β activation leads to increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and ultimately, increased outflow resistance which is a key factor driving elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary open-angle glaucoma. By reducing mitochondrial ROS levels, MitoQ is expected to interfere with the initial oxidative activation of latent TGF-β, thereby preventing the subsequent cascade of SMAD phosphorylation and RhoA/ROCK-mediated fibrosis (Rao et al., 2019). This mechanism is particularly relevant as studies in TM cells have indicated that mitigating oxidative stress can blunt the fibrotic response and improve the cellular homeostasis necessary for proper aqueous humor outflow (Zhang et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
The proposed hypothesis is that MitoQ, by its direct antioxidant action in the mitochondria of trabecular meshwork cells, will reduce the pertinent ROS burden that ordinarily triggers the oxidative activation of latent TGF-β. In turn, this reduction is expected to block the pro-fibrotic downstream signaling cascades. Specifically, by attenuating the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 proteins, MitoQ would diminish SMAD-dependent transcription of genes coding for extracellular matrix proteins, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and various collagens implicated in TM fibrosis. Furthermore, by moderating the activation of RhoA/ROCK pathways—which are responsible for actin stress fiber formation and increased cellular contractility—MitoQ could reduce the stiffness and contractility of the trabecular meshwork, ultimately enhancing aqueous humor outflow and lowering IOP (Rao et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2023).

Current in vitro studies using primary human TM cell cultures have demonstrated that TGF-β2-induced oxidative stress leads to increased ROS production, which is coupled with enhanced Smad phosphorylation, upregulated expression of ECM proteins such as collagen I and IV, and increased formation of actin stress fibers. Mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, including compounds like MitoQ, have been able to attenuate these effects, providing indirect evidence that the oxidative stress in TM cells is a key driver of the TGF-β-mediated fibrotic process (Rao et al., 2019). Additionally, recent literature underscores that antioxidants capable of specifically targeting mitochondrial ROS can prevent the feed-forward loop that normally exacerbates TGF-β activation and subsequent fibrosis (Zhang et al., 2024). Based on these mechanistic insights, it is expected that in assays involving cultured trabecular meshwork cells, treatment with MitoQ will result in a measurable reduction in ROS levels, decreased Smad2/3 phosphorylation, and a corresponding reduction in the expression of key fibrotic markers such as CTGF and collagens. Moreover, since the TGF-β pathway plays a central role in the pathology of glaucoma—by promoting ECM accumulation that impedes the outflow of aqueous humor—the expected cellular response to MitoQ is a restoration of TM cell homeostasis, decreased cell contractility, and ultimately improved aqueous outflow facility (Rao et al., 2019; Buffault et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating MitoQ as a therapeutic candidate for glaucoma, particularly with respect to its potential to ameliorate trabecular meshwork fibrosis via a mitochondrial oxidative stress mechanism, several key strengths and weaknesses emerge.

Among the primary strengths is the highly specific mechanism by which MitoQ acts. Its design as a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant allows it to accumulate within the precise cellular compartment where the majority of ROS are generated, thereby providing robust protection against oxidative damage at its source. This targeted approach not only increases the local concentration of the antioxidant in the mitochondria but also reduces the possibility of interfering with physiological ROS signaling in other cellular compartments—a limitation often encountered with non-targeted antioxidants. The ability of MitoQ to undergo redox cycling, allowing for continuous ROS scavenging, further enhances its therapeutic potential. These properties are well-documented in the context of various systemic conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and metabolic dysfunctions, where improvements in mitochondrial function have been observed following MitoQ supplementation (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Broome et al., 2018).

Another significant advantage is the extensive safety data associated with MitoQ. Multiple clinical trials evaluating the compound in conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and hepatitis C have demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with minimal adverse effects reported at therapeutically relevant doses. This history of safety in humans provides a strong basis for repurposing MitoQ for glaucoma, as any candidate for chronic eye disease must be well tolerated given the likely need for long-term administration (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Broome et al., 2018).

Furthermore, preclinical data specifically pertaining to trabecular meshwork cells indicate that mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants can interfere with TGF-β2 signaling—a key driver of the fibrotic changes underlying increased intraocular pressure in glaucoma. Studies conducted in vitro have shown that treatment with such antioxidants attenuates Smad-dependent transcription and reduces the expression of ECM proteins, thereby mitigating the fibrotic response in TM cells. This is a particularly compelling finding because it aligns directly with the central hypothesis: that by scavenging mitochondrial ROS, MitoQ will prevent the oxidative activation of latent TGF-β and block downstream fibrotic pathways (Rao et al., 2019; Buffault et al., 2020).

However, there are also notable weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. One of the primary limitations is the current lack of direct clinical evidence for the efficacy of MitoQ in treating glaucoma. Although preclinical models provide promising data, the absence of dedicated clinical trials or extensive in vivo studies examining its effects on ocular tissues means that the translational leap from bench to bedside remains unproven. Glaucoma is a multifactorial disease with complex pathophysiology, and while targeting oxidative stress appears promising, the precise impact of MitoQ on long-term IOP regulation and visual field preservation in patients remains to be validated (Rao et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2024).

Additionally, factors such as drug delivery and ocular bioavailability must be carefully considered. The pharmacokinetic profile of MitoQ in systemic circulation is relatively well established; however, ensuring that sufficient concentrations of the compound reach the trabecular meshwork poses a specific challenge. For an ocular therapeutic, formulations such as eye drops, intravitreal injections, or potentially targeted nanocarriers may be needed to achieve therapeutic levels in the TM cells. The limited direct evidence in ocular models necessitates further research on optimal dosing, delivery routes, and potential ocular-specific toxicities (Broome et al., 2018; Rao et al., 2019).

Moreover, while the antioxidant mechanism of MitoQ is well elucidated, there is some complexity regarding the dual role of ROS in the cell. Physiological levels of ROS are essential for normal cellular signaling, and complete suppression may interfere with necessary redox signaling pathways. Thus, careful titration of MitoQ dosing is critical to avoid potential adverse effects due to excessive ROS depletion, which could theoretically impair normal cellular functions—including those crucial for TM cell function (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Broome et al., 2018).

Another consideration is the potential variability in the response of TM cells to MitoQ. Given that trabecular meshwork cells may vary in their mitochondrial content, redox homeostasis, and susceptibility to oxidative stress, personalized or stratified approaches might be necessary to identify those patients most likely to benefit from MitoQ treatment. This variability could complicate clinical trial design and the generalization of results across a diverse patient population (Rao et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2024).

In summary, MitoQ represents a promising therapeutic candidate for glaucoma based on its targeted mechanism of action—specifically, its ability to accumulate in mitochondria, scavenge ROS, and thereby prevent the oxidative activation of latent TGF-β which is known to initiate fibrotic pathways via SMAD and RhoA/ROCK signaling in trabecular meshwork cells. The compound’s synthetic design, which builds on the natural antioxidant Coenzyme Q10, coupled with a well-documented safety profile in human studies of oxidative stress-related diseases, provides a solid foundation for exploring its repurposing in glaucoma. Preclinical data in TM cells are supportive; however, critical gaps remain in our understanding of its ocular pharmacokinetics, delivery, and long-term clinical efficacy in the treatment of glaucoma. Given these strengths and weaknesses, further studies—including targeted preclinical investigations using ocular models and early-phase clinical trials—are necessary to validate the therapeutic potential of MitoQ for managing glaucoma-induced trabecular meshwork fibrosis and improving aqueous humor outflow. The strategic repurposing of MitoQ leverages a validated redox-fibrosis axis with clear translational potential, but diligent work remains to be done to move this candidate from promising hypothesis to clinical reality (Rao et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Broome et al., 2018; Buffault et al., 2020).

"Fresolimumab (GC-1008), a pan–TGF-β neutralizing monoclonal antibody.","Proposal for Fresolimumab (GC-1008), a pan–TGF-β neutralizing monoclonal antibody.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fresolimumab (GC‐1008) is a humanized monoclonal antibody specifically engineered to neutralize all isoforms of transforming growth factor‐beta (TGF‐β1, TGF‐β2, and TGF‐β3), and it belongs to the class of biologic agents that target cytokine signaling pathways. Originally discovered and developed in the context of oncology and fibrotic diseases, fresolimumab was generated through recombinant DNA technology and humanization techniques to achieve high binding affinity (with KD values approximately 1.3–2.8 nM) to TGF‐β isoforms, thereby preventing interactions with their cognate receptors (Akhurst, 2017). As a monoclonal antibody, it is classified under the immunoglobulin G subclass, which inherently possesses high specificity and targeted biological activity. These characteristics allow the molecule to selectively sequester TGF‐β ligands in the extracellular environment. The antibody was synthesized for systemic use initially and has demonstrated safety and pharmacodynamic activity in clinical settings for fibrotic and oncological conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011). The novelty of fresolimumab lies in its isoform‐agnostic inhibition; by neutralizing all active TGF‐β isoforms, it avoids the pitfalls seen with more selective agents that might fail to account for compensatory upregulation of non‐targeted isoforms (Ogata et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Fresolimumab’s therapeutic history is rooted in its prior evaluation in several systemic fibrotic pathologies and oncology indications. It has been tested in phase I and II clinical trials for conditions such as metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006, 2007, 2010). These studies have established that systemic administration of fresolimumab is generally safe and that it exerts the expected biological activity by reducing fibrotic markers and modulating TGF‐β–driven signaling cascades (Akhurst & Hata, 2012; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011). Although these trials have primarily focused on non‐ocular diseases, the role of TGF‐β in tissue fibrosis is a common denominator in a range of pathologies. Importantly, in the context of glaucoma, elevated TGF‐β, especially TGF‐β2, has been implicated in the aberrant deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the trabecular meshwork (TM) and optic nerve head, leading to increased outflow resistance and elevated intraocular pressure (Daher, 2015; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012). Prior clinical exploration of TGF‐β2–targeted approaches in ocular settings, such as the use of selective antibodies (e.g., CAT-152), have met with mixed results, likely due to the redundancy among TGF‐β isoforms. Fresolimumab, by virtue of its pan-TGF-β neutralization, offers an advantage in this regard by addressing potential compensatory pathways mediated by TGF-β3 alongside TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 (Karkampouna & Kruithof-de Julio, 2014; Khaw et al., 2020). Although there is no direct record of fresolimumab’s use in glaucoma to date, the extensive literature on TGF-β’s role in ocular fibrosis and ECM remodeling in glaucoma provides a strong theoretical basis to repurpose this agent for ocular indications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
Fresolimumab functions by binding to all active isoforms of TGF-β with high affinity, thereby sequestering these ligands and preventing them from engaging their receptor complexes on the cell surface. The TGF-β receptor complex, typically formed by TGF-β receptor type I (TGF-βRI) and type II (TGF-βRII), upon ligand binding, initiates intracellular signaling cascades primarily via phosphorylation of receptor-regulated SMAD proteins (SMAD2 and SMAD3), which then complex with the common mediator SMAD4. This complex translocates into the nucleus to modulate the transcription of pro-fibrotic genes, including those that drive the production of extracellular matrix proteins (such as collagen, fibronectin, and elastin) as well as those that induce connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Saika, 2006). In the trabecular meshwork, excessive activation of the TGF-β/SMAD pathway results in a fibrotic phenotype characterized by increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and tissue stiffness, thereby increasing aqueous outflow resistance and in turn elevating intraocular pressure (IOP) (Prendes et al., 2013; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012). By neutralizing TGF-β, fresolimumab is expected to interrupt this cascade of SMAD-dependent transcriptional activation, reduce ECM deposition, and inhibit the myofibroblast transition of TM cells (Akhurst, 2017). Biochemically, fresolimumab’s binding to TGF-β prevents it from interacting with its receptors on target cells such as the trabecular meshwork, thereby mitigating the downstream signaling events that normally trigger fibrotic responses (Ogata et al., 2024). This broad-spectrum inhibition is particularly important in the ocular environment where multiple isoforms may be simultaneously active, and selective inhibition might not be sufficient due to potential upregulation of alternate isoforms (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis driving the repurposing of fresolimumab for glaucoma postulates that subconjunctival or topical administration will allow the antibody to reach the anterior chamber of the eye, where it can bind elevated levels of TGF-β isoforms. In glaucomatous eyes, TGF-β—most notably TGF-β2—is known to be overexpressed in the trabecular meshwork, leading to enhanced activation of the SMAD signaling pathway and subsequent pathological matrix deposition (Daher, 2015; Tovar-Vidales et al., 2011). By sequestering these cytokines, fresolimumab would prevent receptor engagement on trabecular meshwork cells and block downstream pro-fibrotic signaling. The expected molecular outcome is a reduction in SMAD-driven transcription of candidate genes that code for ECM proteins as well as enzymes such as tissue transglutaminase (TGM2), which are implicated in ECM crosslinking and tissue stiffness (Tovar-Vidales et al., 2011; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012). Consequently, this should restore a more normal balance of ECM synthesis and degradation, reduce TM fibrosis, improve aqueous humor outflow, and ultimately result in a lowering of intraocular pressure. Supporting this mode of action, animal studies have shown that inhibition of TGF-β signaling can lead to decreased outflow resistance and lower IOP, and related anti-TGF-β strategies (albeit with isoform-specific antibodies) have demonstrated some benefits in decreasing postoperative scarring following glaucoma surgery (Yamanaka et al., 2015; Prendes et al., 2013). Importantly, the use of a pan-TGF-β neutralizing antibody such as fresolimumab may overcome the limitations observed with selective inhibitors that fail to address the contributions of multiple isoforms, thereby providing a more robust therapeutic effect in a multifactorial disease process like glaucoma (Akhurst & Hata, 2012; Ogata et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Fresolimumab presents as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of glaucoma. Its molecular design as a pan-TGF-β neutralizing antibody offers several distinct advantages. First, by targeting all isoforms of TGF-β, fresolimumab addresses the compensatory mechanisms that can often undermine selective inhibition strategies; this is critical in glaucoma, where elevated TGF-β2 is a central driver of ECM deposition in the trabecular meshwork but TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 may also contribute to disease progression (Akhurst, 2017; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012). Second, the specificity afforded by the antibody modality ensures a targeted blockade of TGF-β signaling with minimal off-target effects, a particularly desirable property for potential local (subconjunctival or topical) administration, where systemic exposure and adverse effects can be minimized (Ogata et al., 2024; Prendes et al., 2013). Additionally, the extensive clinical and preclinical data demonstrating the antifibrotic effects of TGF-β neutralization in other organ systems underpin its potential effectiveness in mitigating the ECM-related pathology observed in glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012).

However, several challenges remain. The translation of systemic dosing regimens and safety profiles observed in oncology and fibrotic diseases to an ocular setting is not straightforward. While animal studies have indicated that TGF-β blockade can ameliorate fibrosis and improve outflow resistance, there is a paucity of direct evidence from ocular administration studies with fresolimumab. Local pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration, and sustained activity within the anterior chamber after subconjunctival or topical delivery will need to be meticulously evaluated (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ogata et al., 2024). Moreover, while high specificity is a strength, complete inhibition of TGF-β signaling could potentially impair physiological wound healing and immune regulation, which are essential in the delicate ocular environment, particularly following surgical interventions (Yamanaka et al., 2015). The balance between antifibrotic efficacy and the preservation of TGF-β’s homeostatic functions will be a key consideration in dose selection and administration route development.

Another consideration is the potential for local immunogenicity or unforeseen adverse effects unique to the ocular surface. While fresolimumab has demonstrated favorable safety profiles in systemic trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2012; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016), the ocular immune milieu differs from systemic circulation, and local delivery might uncover unique safety challenges. Furthermore, it is critical to establish that the antibody can achieve sufficient intraocular concentrations to neutralize TGF-β isoforms effectively without compromising other physiological processes, such as epithelial integrity or tear film stability (Akhurst & Hata, 2012).

Despite these challenges, the strengths of fresolimumab—its robust mechanism of action, broad-spectrum neutralization, and the strong preclinical rationale supporting TGF-β’s role in glaucomatous ECM deposition—make it a compelling candidate for further investigation. Its potential to reduce SMAD-driven fibrotic signaling in the trabecular meshwork could lead to meaningful decreases in outflow resistance and IOP, which are central therapeutic targets in glaucoma (Prendes et al., 2013; Tovar-Vidales et al., 2011). Given the unmet need in the current glaucoma therapeutic landscape, particularly with respect to disease-modifying treatments that target the underlying fibrotic processes, fresolimumab represents a scientifically sound and strategically promising option for repurposing (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Ogata et al., 2024).

In summary, fresolimumab’s well-documented ability to neutralize all TGF-β isoforms, its favorable safety and pharmacodynamic profiles observed in systemic fibrotic and oncological trials, and the strong mechanistic rationale linking TGF-β activity to glaucomatous changes in the trabecular meshwork collectively support the hypothesis that local (subconjunctival or topical) administration could decrease SMAD-dependent ECM deposition, alleviate outflow resistance, and ultimately lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. Although direct ocular evidence is presently limited, the extensive supportive data from preclinical models and clinical studies in other fibrotic conditions justify further focused studies to explore the ocular pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of fresolimumab in glaucoma (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012). With careful optimization of delivery strategies and dosing paradigms, fresolimumab holds promise as a novel therapeutic approach for modifying the disease course of glaucoma by targeting the underlying fibrotic mechanisms.

"SIS3 (Sigma-Aldrich cat. S7665), a selective SMAD3 phosphorylation inhibitor.

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of SIS3 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma.","Proposal for SIS3 (Sigma-Aldrich cat. S7665), a selective SMAD3 phosphorylation inhibitor.

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of SIS3 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SIS3 (Sigma-Aldrich cat. S7665) is a synthetic small molecule engineered to selectively inhibit phosphorylation of SMAD3, a key intracellular mediator of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling. The inhibitor was discovered through focused medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at identifying compounds that could bind to the MH2 domain of SMAD3, which is essential for its activation by type I TGF-β receptors. Unlike broad-spectrum TGF-β receptor inhibitors, SIS3 is designed to spare SMAD2 phosphorylation while specifically targeting SMAD3 activation. This degree of selectivity classifies SIS3 among a class of targeted antifibrotic agents that have been widely studied in experimental models of fibrosis. SIS3’s synthetic origin ensures that its production can be finely controlled with respect to purity and pharmacokinetic properties, attributes that are advantageous in drug development and repurposing efforts. Its chemical nature as a small molecule enhances cell membrane penetration and facilitates intracellular distribution, thereby permitting direct interaction with SMAD3 in human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells—a cell type critically involved in the regulation of aqueous humor outflow (Jinnin, Ihn, & Tamaki, 2006). The engineered specificity of SIS3 for the SMAD3 MH2 domain forms the basis for its therapeutic potential, particularly given that TGF-β–induced fibrotic responses in ocular tissues have been postulated to contribute to the pathological ECM deposition seen in glaucoma (Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, SIS3 has been used primarily as an experimental tool in preclinical studies to dissect the role of SMAD3 in fibrosis. In vitro investigations in human dermal fibroblasts have demonstrated that SIS3 potently blocks TGF-β1-induced SMAD3 phosphorylation, leading to a significant downregulation of profibrotic genes such as those for type I collagen, fibronectin, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (Jinnin et al., 2006). These studies have provided proof of concept for SIS3’s antifibrotic efficacy by showing that the compound can diminish myofibroblast differentiation and reduce the deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in fibrotic diseases such as scleroderma. Moreover, in experimental models of kidney fibrosis, including the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model, SIS3 has been shown to attenuate not only ECM deposition but also the associated inflammatory and apoptotic responses (Ji et al., 2018). Although these preclinical studies were carried out in non‐ocular systems such as dermal and renal tissues, they establish the mechanistic rationale for targeting SMAD3 in fibrotic conditions. Elevated levels of TGF-β2 in the aqueous humor have been documented in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, and studies using genome‐wide transcriptome profiling of human TM cells treated with TGF-β2 have demonstrated that SMAD3 is a key mediator driving a profibrotic gene expression profile in these cells (Callaghan et al., 2022). Additionally, investigations into the regulation of BMP genes and ECM production in TM cells further underscore the central role of SMAD3 in mediating fibrotic responses in glaucoma (Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022). Although SIS3 has not yet been directly tested in clinical or veterinary settings for glaucoma, the extensive preclinical evidence from other fibrotic models provides a strong rationale for its repurposing to target TM fibrosis, which contributes to increased intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucomatous eyes (Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009).

Mechanism of Action:
At the biochemical level, TGF-β signaling is initiated when TGF-β ligands bind to a heteromeric receptor complex comprised of type I and type II serine/threonine kinases. This binding event leads to the phosphorylation of downstream receptor-regulated SMAD proteins (R-SMADs) – primarily SMAD2 and SMAD3. Phosphorylation of SMAD3 occurs at conserved serine residues located in the C-terminal SSXS motif within its MH2 domain. Once phosphorylated, SMAD3 undergoes a conformational change that facilitates its association with SMAD4, forming a heteromeric complex that translocates into the nucleus and binds to specific DNA elements (such as the CAGA box) to activate the transcription of genes involved in ECM production—including genes encoding CTGF, various collagen isoforms, and fibronectin (Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009; Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022). SIS3 exerts its therapeutic effect by selectively binding to the SMAD3 MH2 domain, thereby blocking the phosphorylation event required for SMAD3 activation. This inhibition prevents SMAD3 from forming complexes with SMAD4 and from translocating to the nucleus. Importantly, the specificity of SIS3 means that it does not affect SMAD2 phosphorylation or other parallel signaling cascades such as those mediated by p38 MAPK or ERK, ensuring that only SMAD3-dependent profibrotic gene transcription is downregulated (Jinnin et al., 2006). In the pathological context of the human TM, elevated TGF-β2 signaling leads to SMAD3-mediated upregulation of ECM proteins, promoting fibrosis and increasing tissue stiffness. By inhibiting SMAD3 phosphorylation, SIS3 is expected to suppress the transcription of key fibrotic mediators such as CTGF and collagen, thereby reducing ECM accumulation. This targeted intervention interrupts the fibrotic cascade that underlies impaired aqueous humor drainage and elevated IOP in glaucoma (Callaghan et al., 2022; Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, treatment of human trabecular meshwork cells with SIS3 is expected to result in several beneficial outcomes. The primary effect is the blockade of SMAD3 phosphorylation, which in turn prevents the formation of the SMAD3–SMAD4 transcriptional complex and halts its nuclear translocation. This leads to a downregulation of ECM-related genes such as those encoding CTGF, collagen, and fibronectin—a profile that has been consistently observed in non–ocular cell types upon SIS3 treatment (Jinnin et al., 2006). In the trabecular meshwork, where elevated TGF-β2 levels drive a fibrotic gene expression profile, inhibition of SMAD3 signaling by SIS3 is anticipated to reduce ECM deposition and cellular contractility, thereby decreasing TM stiffness and improving aqueous humor outflow (Callaghan et al., 2022; Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022). Furthermore, recent studies have also implicated SMAD3 in mediating cellular senescence and oxidative stress in TM cells following glucocorticoid exposure, suggesting that SIS3 might not only reduce fibrotic ECM remodeling but also ameliorate senescence-associated phenotypes in these cells (Li et al., 2023a). Collectively, the expected net effect of SIS3 is a reduction in ECM accumulation and a restoration of a less fibrotic, more dynamic trabecular meshwork. In practical terms, this should translate into an improvement in aqueous humor drainage, leading to a reduction in IOP, which is the primary modifiable risk factor in glaucoma management (Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009; Callaghan et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Our overall evaluation of SIS3 as a repurposed candidate for glaucoma therapy is cautiously optimistic, as its molecular mechanism and preclinical antifibrotic profile strongly support its potential to counteract trabecular meshwork fibrosis. One of the principal strengths of SIS3 lies in its remarkable mechanistic specificity. By binding selectively to the SMAD3 MH2 domain and inhibiting its phosphorylation, SIS3 can effectively block a critical step in the TGF-β signaling cascade that is directly implicated in the pathological ECM deposition observed in glaucomatous trabecular meshwork (Jinnin et al., 2006). This targeted approach minimizes the risk of unintended interference with SMAD2-mediated signaling and other physiological processes, offering a potential safety advantage over less selective TGF-β pathway inhibitors (Jinnin et al., 2006).

The preclinical evidence establishing the antifibrotic effects of SIS3 in dermal fibroblasts and renal fibrosis models further bolsters the argument for its repurposing in glaucoma. Studies have shown that SIS3 not only reduces the expression of profibrotic genes such as collagen, fibronectin, and CTGF but also mitigates myofibroblast differentiation, a key contributor to tissue stiffness (Jinnin et al., 2006; Ji et al., 2018). Given that similar fibrotic mechanisms are observed in the trabecular meshwork of glaucomatous eyes—where TGF-β2 is elevated and drives SMAD3-dependent ECM remodeling—the rationale for employing SIS3 in this context is compelling (Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009; Callaghan et al., 2022; Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022).

Despite these strengths, several challenges need to be carefully addressed. To date, most of the supportive data for SIS3 derive from non-ocular models, and there remains a significant gap with respect to direct evaluation in human trabecular meshwork cells or glaucoma animal models. Although transcriptomic and biochemical studies have confirmed the importance of TGF-β/SMAD3 signaling in TM fibrosis (Callaghan et al., 2022; Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022), definitive proof that SIS3 can reduce ECM deposition and lower IOP in ocular tissues is still lacking. This necessitates rigorous preclinical studies in ocular model systems to establish both efficacy and safety in the context of glaucoma (Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009).

Another challenge pertains to ocular drug delivery. The eye is a sensitive organ with complex barriers that can complicate the delivery of small molecules to target tissues such as the trabecular meshwork. Optimizing a formulation that ensures adequate bioavailability of SIS3 within the TM—whether by topical administration, subconjunctival injection, or another route—will be critical to translating its preclinical antifibrotic effects into clinical benefit (Li et al., 2023a). In addition, given that SMAD3 is involved in multiple biological processes, complete inhibition of its activity might inadvertently perturb normal TGF-β functions that are essential for tissue homeostasis, immune regulation, and repair. Therefore, achieving an optimal therapeutic window that maximizes antifibrotic benefits while minimizing potential adverse effects will be essential (McDowell, Tebow, Wordinger, & Clark, 2013).

Moreover, glaucoma is a multifactorial disease. Although SMAD3-mediated ECM deposition represents a central mechanism contributing to increased outflow resistance in the TM, other pathways—such as those regulating oxidative stress, autophagy, and non-SMAD signaling (including Rho kinase pathways)—also play significant roles in the disease’s progression (Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022; Li et al., 2023b). As such, while selective inhibition of SMAD3 by SIS3 may provide substantial benefit in reducing TM fibrosis, it may need to be combined with other therapeutic strategies to comprehensively address the multifaceted pathology of glaucoma.

In summary, SIS3 offers a strong mechanistic basis as a targeted inhibitor of SMAD3 phosphorylation, and its antifibrotic effects in non-ocular models provide persuasive preliminary evidence supporting its potential repurposing for glaucoma therapy. Its anticipated effect in reducing the transcriptional activation of fibrotic genes in human trabecular meshwork cells is expected to curb ECM accumulation, lower cell contractility, and ultimately enhance aqueous humor drainage to reduce intraocular pressure. However, to fully validate SIS3 as a glaucoma therapeutic, additional studies must directly evaluate its efficacy in TM cells and relevant animal models, optimize ocular delivery methods, and carefully define its safety profile. These further investigations are essential for ensuring that the promising antifibrotic properties of SIS3 can be translated into improved clinical outcomes for glaucoma patients (Jinnin et al., 2006; Callaghan et al., 2022; Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Our evaluation of SIS3 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma is therefore cautiously optimistic. The compound’s strong mechanistic specificity—being able to selectively bind the SMAD3 MH2 domain and prevent its phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation—is ideally suited to counteracting TGF-β–driven fibrotic processes that impair trabecular meshwork function (Jinnin et al., 2006). Preclinical findings in non-ocular models, including dermal fibroblasts and kidney fibrosis models, robustly demonstrate that SIS3 decreases profibrotic gene expression and ECM deposition, effects that are directly translatable to the envisioned antifibrotic strategy in glaucoma (Ji et al., 2018; Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009). Moreover, transcriptome profiling of human TM cells under TGF-β2 exposure reaffirms the pivotal role of SMAD3 in mediating ECM accumulation, thereby strengthening the rationale for SIS3’s use in this setting (Callaghan et al., 2022; Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022).

Nonetheless, challenges remain that must be surmounted before advancing SIS3 through the glaucoma drug development pipeline. Key among these is the need for direct experimental validation in ocular tissues to confirm that SIS3 can lower IOP by improving aqueous humor outflow. Likewise, the development of an ocular delivery system that can achieve therapeutic concentrations within the trabecular meshwork without adverse effects on other ocular tissues is critical. Additionally, as TGF-β signaling fulfills various physiological roles, carefully balancing the inhibition of SMAD3 to avoid detrimental side effects will be imperative (McDowell et al., 2013; Li et al., 2023a). Finally, given glaucoma’s multifactorial nature, it is possible that SIS3 might eventually be used in combination with other agents—such as ROCK inhibitors—to address both fibrosis and other contributing pathogenic pathways (Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022; Li et al., 2023b).

In conclusion, while SIS3 is not yet clinically validated in the context of glaucoma, its selective inhibition of SMAD3 phosphorylation offers a promising strategy to mitigate TM fibrosis—a principal contributor to increased outflow resistance and elevated intraocular pressure in glaucoma. The extensive preclinical antifibrotic evidence, coupled with a strong mechanistic rationale, supports further investigation of SIS3 as a candidate for repurposing. Future studies should prioritize direct evaluation in trabecular meshwork cells and glaucoma animal models, ocular pharmacokinetic assessments, and formulation development to determine the feasibility of translating SIS3’s antifibrotic effects into clinically meaningful outcomes for patients with glaucoma (Jinnin et al., 2006; Callaghan et al., 2022; Choudhari & Chatterjee, 2022).

"SB525334, a selective TGF-β receptor type I kinase inhibitor.","Proposal for SB525334, a selective TGF-β receptor type I kinase inhibitor.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SB525334 is a synthetically derived small‐molecule inhibitor that belongs to the class of TGF-β receptor type I kinase inhibitors, specifically targeting activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) (Unknown Reference, 2010). This compound was discovered through medicinal chemistry screening efforts aimed at identifying molecules that can bind to the ATP‐binding pocket of serine/threonine kinases involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway. Its chemical design focuses on high selectivity and potency for the ALK5 kinase, thereby distinguishing it from some earlier inhibitors such as SB431542 by exhibiting improved selectivity profiles (Unknown Reference, 2010; Zhang et al., 2020). The molecular origin of SB525334 is based on prior structure–activity relationship studies, and related molecules such as SB-505124 have established proof-of-concept in inhibiting fibrotic responses in ocular tissues through targeted ALK5 blockade (Unknown Reference, 2010). As a representative of small molecule receptor kinase inhibitors, compounds in this class have historically been leveraged for their antifibrotic effects in different preclinical models including pulmonary, cardiac, and ocular fibrosis. Thus, SB525334 represents an evolution of this drug class with a defined binding mode aimed at interrupting pathological TGF-β signaling cascades implicated in fibrosis (Clinical Trial Search: SB525334 OR TGF-beta receptor inhibitor AND (glaucoma OR ocular)).

Therapeutic History:
The TGF-β receptor type I kinase inhibitors, including SB525334, have been extensively studied in various models of fibrosis. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that ALK5 inhibitors such as SB-505124 and SB431542 can effectively suppress TGF-β-induced fibrosis by inhibiting phosphorylation of downstream effectors such as Smad2 and Smad3, which in turn abrogate the transcription of profibrotic genes, for instance connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (Unknown Reference, 2010). In ocular applications, particularly in the context of glaucoma filtration surgery (GFS), these inhibitors have been explored as means to reduce postoperative scarring and improve filtering bleb survival in rabbit models by mitigating fibroblast activation and excessive extracellular matrix deposition (Unknown Reference, 2010). Although SB525334 itself is not as widely featured as some of its analogues in the literature provided, it is understood to share the same mechanistic basis and belonging to the same drug class that has previously been evaluated in ocular fibrosis models. Moreover, related TGF-β receptor inhibitors have been employed in clinical trial searches for ocular diseases, with at least four registered studies investigating their role in glaucoma and other ocular conditions (Clinical Trial Search: SB525334 OR TGF-beta receptor inhibitor AND (glaucoma OR ocular)), indicating the translational interest in this therapeutic approach. Outside of ophthalmology, TGF-β kinase inhibitors have also been developed for the treatment of fibrotic diseases in organs such as the lung (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis) and kidney, and for modulating tumor microenvironments in oncology, as exemplified by agents like galunisertib in clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017). Thus, while direct clinical use of SB525334 in glaucoma remains to be fully established, its drug class has a robust history of antifibrotic applications both in veterinary and experimental clinical settings (Unknown Reference, 2010; Zhang et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism by which SB525334 is proposed to function centers on its ability to bind specifically to the ATP-binding pocket of ALK5, thereby competitively inhibiting its kinase activity. Under normal physiological conditions, TGF-β ligands bind to type II receptors, which in turn recruit and phosphorylate type I receptors (ALK5). Once activated, ALK5 phosphorylates receptor-regulated Smad proteins (predominantly Smad2 and Smad3), which then translocate to the nucleus to instigate the transcription of genes underpinning fibrotic processes such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), collagen, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (Unknown Reference, 2010). SB525334, by docking into the ATP-binding site, disrupts this phosphorylation cascade. Computational docking studies with analogues, such as SB-505124, reveal that these inhibitors establish critical hydrogen bond interactions with amino acid residues like His-283, Ser-280, Asp-351, Glu-245, and Tyr-249 in the ALK5 kinase domain (Unknown Reference, 2010). This detailed interaction not only blocks the enzymatic activity of ALK5 but also prevents the subsequent activation of Smad2/3 and the induction of pro-fibrotic transcriptional programs. In trabecular meshwork cells, where TGF-β signaling is implicated in the development of increased extracellular matrix deposition and actomyosin contraction, inhibition of the Smad pathway is expected to reduce fibrosis and restore normal aqueous humor dynamics (Zhang et al., 2020; Unknown Reference, 2010). The enhanced selectivity of SB525334 for TGF-β receptor type I compared to earlier inhibitors like SB431542 suggests that it may offer improved efficacy with fewer off-target effects, a critical consideration given the broad role of TGF-β signaling in numerous biological processes (Unknown Reference, 2010). Consequently, by preventing the phosphorylation of Smad2/3, SB525334 effectively blocks the fibrotic transcription program and may inhibit pathological actomyosin contraction, ultimately enhancing aqueous outflow in glaucoma (Unknown Reference, 2010).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis behind using SB525334 in glaucoma therapy is that by selectively inhibiting ALK5, the compound will block the aberrant TGF-β signaling in trabecular meshwork cells. TGF-β signaling in these cells has been shown to enhance extracellular matrix production and promote fibrotic remodeling, thereby contributing to increased outflow resistance and elevated intraocular pressure (I.O.P.) (Zhang et al., 2020). With SB525334 binding to the ATP‐pocket of ALK5, the resultant inhibition of Smad2/3 phosphorylation should lead to a reduction in the transcriptional activation of fibrotic genes such as CTGF and α-SMA (Unknown Reference, 2010). In vitro studies using cell models, including rabbit subconjunctival fibroblasts, have demonstrated that similar compounds can effectively reduce fibrotic marker expression and preserve cell viability relative to current agents like mitomycin C (MMC) that, while effective at inhibiting scarring, cause significant cytotoxicity (Unknown Reference, 2010). Extrapolating to trabecular meshwork cells, one would expect SB525334 to inhibit the actomyosin contraction process associated with fibrotic remodeling, thereby ameliorating the increased resistance within the aqueous humor outflow pathway. The inhibition of TGF-β-induced fibrotic responses should theoretically result in decreased extracellular matrix deposition and enhanced facility of aqueous humor outflow, leading to a reduction in I.O.P. and improved glaucomatous conditions (Zhang et al., 2020; Unknown Reference, 2010). Given that TGF-β pathway components such as TGFβR1/ALK5 and SMAD2/3 are expressed in trabecular meshwork cells and implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, the proposed action of SB525334 is supported by molecular studies and preclinical ocular fibrosis models (Zhang et al., 2020; Unknown Reference, 2010).

Overall Evaluation:
SB525334 emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for glaucoma by virtue of its selective inhibition of TGF-β receptor type I kinase activity, a critical facilitator of the fibrotic process that impairs trabecular meshwork function. One of the principal strengths of SB525334 lies in its mechanism of action: by targeting the ATP-binding pocket of ALK5, it prevents the phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of Smad2/3, thereby directly interfering with the transcriptional programs that lead to extracellular matrix deposition and actomyosin contraction (Unknown Reference, 2010). This selective inhibition is particularly important because it offers the potential to reduce side effects that might arise from broader inhibition of TGF-β signaling, which is inherently involved in a variety of physiological processes. Moreover, the preclinical data from ocular fibrosis models support the hypothesis that ALK5 inhibitors can prolong bleb survival and diminish scarring following glaucoma filtration surgery, thereby directly translating to improvements in aqueous humor outflow and I.O.P. control (Unknown Reference, 2010).

A further strength is the detailed biochemical understanding and the computational docking evidence that underpin the design of SB525334. The ability to predict key hydrogen bond interactions with amino acids such as His-283 and Ser-280 reinforces confidence in its target specificity and mechanistic efficacy (Unknown Reference, 2010). Additionally, clinical trial searches suggest that compounds within this class have garnered interest in ocular applications, indicating a recognized translational potential despite the challenges inherent in modulating TGF-β signaling (Clinical Trial Search: SB525334 OR TGF-beta receptor inhibitor AND (glaucoma OR ocular)).

However, there are some potential weaknesses and considerations that must be addressed. While the antifibrotic efficacy has been demonstrated in animal models of ocular scarring, the direct use of SB525334 in human trabecular meshwork cells or clinical settings for glaucoma remains to be fully validated. Moreover, although the selectivity of this compound is a major advantage, the comprehensive evaluation of its pharmacokinetic profile, long-term systemic safety, and potential off-target effects in the human eye has yet to be clearly established in the context of glaucoma (Zhang et al., 2020). Furthermore, given that TGF-β signaling plays a dual role in both normal wound healing and pathological fibrosis, the timing, dosage, and mode of delivery of SB525334 will be critical factors to optimize in order to avoid impairing physiological processes while suppressing abnormal fibrotic responses.

In summary, SB525334 offers significant mechanistic clarity and preclinical promise as a candidate for treating glaucoma by targeting the TGF-β/ALK5/Smad2/3 signaling cascade involved in trabecular meshwork fibrosis and increased outflow resistance. Its demonstrated efficacy in ocular fibrosis models, combined with its favorable toxicity profile relative to conventional agents like mitomycin C, underpins its potential utility in glaucoma management. Nonetheless, further rigorous preclinical studies focused on trabecular meshwork cell biology, as well as early-stage clinical evaluations, will be essential to confirm its safety, optimal dosing, and long-term therapeutic benefits in the context of glaucoma (Unknown Reference, 2010; Zhang et al., 2020). Overall, the balance of available evidence supports the continued investigation of SB525334 as a targeted antifibrotic therapy for glaucoma, with particular promise in its ability to counteract the deleterious TGF-β-induced fibrotic remodeling in ocular tissues (Clinical Trial Search: SB525334 OR TGF-beta receptor inhibitor AND (glaucoma OR ocular); Unknown Reference, 2010; Zhang et al., 2020).

"Sulforaphane, an Nrf2 pathway activator (Cayman Chemical cat. 77919).","Proposal for Sulforaphane, an Nrf2 pathway activator (Cayman Chemical cat. 77919).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate predominantly found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli. It was first discovered as part of research into dietary chemopreventive agents and has subsequently been characterized for its potent ability to activate the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway (Zhang et al., 2024, pp. 12–13). Belonging to the class of phytochemicals, sulforaphane has been employed as a dietary supplement and as an experimental therapeutic agent for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic properties. This compound is produced naturally by the hydrolysis of glucoraphanin via the enzyme myrosinase, and its chemical purity, as provided for example by Cayman Chemical (cat. 77919), further ensures reproducibility in experimental contexts. The class of Nrf2 activators to which sulforaphane belongs has a well-established history in modulating cellular redox homeostasis and has been investigated in numerous models of oxidative stress–related conditions, including various neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and ophthalmic diseases (Wherry, 2012, pp. 137–142).

Therapeutic History:
Sulforaphane’s therapeutic history encompasses a wide range of preclinical and biochemical studies that have demonstrated its ability to counteract oxidative stress in different organ systems. In ophthalmology, sulforaphane has been investigated for its cytoprotective effects in retinal pigment epithelial cells and corneal endothelial cells, as well as for its potential to attenuate photooxidative damage and other reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated injuries (Zhang et al., 2024, p. 13). Although direct clinical trials using sulforaphane for glaucoma treatment are currently absent—as evidenced by a search on ClinicalTrials.gov showing no registered trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—its preclinical utility in mitigating oxidative stress in ocular tissues is promising (Batliwala et al., 2017, pp. 10–11). Additionally, studies exploring its effects in fibroblasts have revealed that sulforaphane can inhibit transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)–induced fibrotic responses, suggesting potential benefits in conditions where fibrosis plays a role, such as in the trabecular meshwork of glaucoma patients (“Sulforaphane inhibits TGF-β-induced fibrogenesis and inflammation in human Tenon’s fibroblasts,” 2023, pp. 9–10).

Mechanism of Action:
Sulforaphane acts primarily by activating the Nrf2 pathway, a master regulator of antioxidant responses in cells. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its negative regulator Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1); sulforaphane covalently modifies specific cysteine residues on Keap1 (notably Cys151 among others), causing a conformational change that disrupts the Nrf2–Keap1 interaction, enabling Nrf2 to escape proteasomal degradation (Wherry, 2012, pp. 122–126). Once released, Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of target genes, leading to enhanced transcription of a suite of cytoprotective genes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and thioredoxin (Zhang et al., 2024, pp. 12–13; Wherry, 2012, pp. 122–126). In addition to its antioxidant action, sulforaphane has been shown to modulate intracellular signaling cascades such as those mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase C (PKC), which further augment Nrf2 activation and the subsequent expression of phase II detoxifying enzymes (Wherry, 2012, pp. 122–126). Of particular relevance to glaucoma, sulforaphane is posited to reduce ROS-induced activation of latent TGF-β, a key cytokine that drives fibrotic responses in the trabecular meshwork, leading to abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition; studies in related fibroblast models have demonstrated that sulforaphane can inhibit TGF-β signaling thereby reducing myofibroblast differentiation and ECM gene expression (“Sulforaphane inhibits TGF-β-induced fibrogenesis and inflammation in human Tenon’s fibroblasts,” 2023, pp. 1–2, 10–11). Thus, by simultaneously enhancing antioxidant defenses and suppressing pro-fibrotic signaling, sulforaphane operates through a dual mechanism that directly intersects with key pathogenic pathways implicated in glaucoma (Batliwala et al., 2017, pp. 10–11; Wang et al., 2020, pp. 2–3).

Expected Effect:
Based on its well-documented mechanism of action, it is expected that sulforaphane will induce robust Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses in trabecular meshwork (TM) cells. Enhanced expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1 and NQO1 should mitigate oxidative injury and help preserve TM cell function (Wang et al., 2020, pp. 5–6, 7–8). In the context of glaucoma, where oxidative stress contributes significantly to TM dysfunction and subsequent impairment of aqueous humor outflow, the activation of Nrf2 by sulforaphane could lower intraocular pressure (IOP) by protecting TM cells against ROS-induced damage. Additionally, sulforaphane is expected to reduce the activation of latent TGF-β by ROS, thereby preventing the TGF-β-mediated fibrotic remodeling of the TM. This modulation of TGF-β signaling is anticipated to downregulate fibrotic ECM gene expression, preserving the structural integrity and flexibility of the TM, which are critical factors for maintaining proper aqueous humor dynamics (Hurley et al., 2022, pp. 21–23; Wang et al., 2020, pp. 3–5). Although direct evidence for IOP lowering by sulforaphane is currently indirect, numerous preclinical models suggest that a reduction in TM cellular fibrosis and oxidative stress correlates with improved aqueous humor outflow and lowered IOP (Zhang et al., 2024, pp. 14–15; Yang et al., 2024, pp. 27–28).

Overall Evaluation:
Sulforaphane represents a promising therapeutic candidate for glaucoma from multiple perspectives. Its natural origin and favorable safety profile, established through its use as a dietary supplement and in various preclinical models, provide an attractive basis for drug repurposing (Zhang et al., 2024, pp. 12–13; Batliwala et al., 2017, pp. 10–11). The dual mechanism of action—activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant defense system combined with inhibition of TGF-β-mediated pro-fibrotic signaling—addresses two central pathological processes in glaucoma: oxidative damage and fibrotic remodeling of the trabecular meshwork. The induced expression of antioxidant enzymes may protect TM cells from ROS, while the concomitant reduction in ECM and fibrotic gene expression could improve aqueous humor outflow, ultimately contributing to a reduction in IOP (“Sulforaphane inhibits TGF-β-induced fibrogenesis and inflammation in human Tenon’s fibroblasts,” 2023, pp. 9–10; Wang et al., 2020, pp. 7–8). Despite these strengths, weaknesses include the current lack of direct clinical evidence specifically in glaucoma models, as noted by the absence of registered clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) and the need for enhanced bioavailability formulations to overcome challenges of poor solubility and tissue-specific delivery. Moreover, while in vitro and animal studies support the mechanistic rationale, translation of these findings into clinically meaningful IOP reductions remains to be conclusively demonstrated (Zhang et al., 2024, p. 13; Rohowetz et al., 2018, pp. 23–24). In summary, sulforaphane’s ability to fine-tune redox signaling and suppress fibrotic cascades through Nrf2 activation makes it a highly attractive candidate for further investigation in glaucoma, warranting additional preclinical studies with a focus on trabecular meshwork-specific outcomes and subsequent clinical trials to establish proof-of-concept in patients (Hurley et al., 2022, pp. 16–17; Ziaei et al., 2013, pp. 10–11).

"LY2109761 (Sigma-Aldrich cat. SML0574).

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of LY2109761 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma.","Proposal for LY2109761 (Sigma-Aldrich cat. SML0574).

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of LY2109761 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
LY2109761 is a synthetically derived small‐molecule inhibitor originally discovered through medicinal chemistry optimization efforts targeting the transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) receptor kinases. This compound belongs to the dihydropyrrolopyrazole class, which was developed by rational drug design methods that screened chemical libraries for candidates capable of inhibiting the kinase domain of TGF‐β receptor type I (also known as ALK5) and type II. In this design process, structure–activity relationship studies were undertaken to optimize potency and oral bioavailability, with X‐ray crystallography being used to validate its binding mode in the ATP‐binding pocket of the receptor kinase domain (Li et al., 2008). This class of compounds has previously been used in oncology as TGF‐β signaling inhibitors, where they have been evaluated for anti‐tumor efficacy, the ability to reduce metastasis, and to interfere with epithelial–mesenchymal transition. LY2109761, marketed by Sigma-Aldrich (cat. SML0574), was originally developed for its antitumor properties by demonstrating the ability to inhibit TGF‐β receptor kinase-mediated signaling, and it has shown promising antifibrotic activities in various nonocular studies (Ling & Lee, 2011; Melisi et al., 2008).

Therapeutic History:
Biochemically, LY2109761 has been profiled extensively in preclinical studies focused on fibrotic diseases and oncology. Preclinical animal models in cancer – particularly pancreatic cancer – highlighted its capacity to suppress tumor growth and metastasis through dual inhibition of TGF‐β receptor type I and II, blocking key downstream events such as SMAD phosphorylation and noncanonical MAPK activation (Melisi et al., 2008; Nagaraj & Datta, 2010). Its development as a TGF‐β receptor kinase inhibitor was aimed at targeting the fibrogenic responses mediated by TGF‐β, and indeed, LY2109761 has shown anti‐fibrotic efficacy in models of visceral organ fibrosis and liver fibrosis, reducing extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition by impairing SMAD and MAPK signaling (Luangmonkong et al., 2018; Markell, 2010). While the compound has not been evaluated in glaucoma per se, the inhibition of TGF‐β signaling has been a promising approach in other fibrotic disorders of the eye. For instance, other TGF‐β inhibitors and antibodies such as lerdelimumab have been clinically trialed in trabeculectomy to prevent bleb fibrosis (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ogata et al., 2024). In glaucoma, the pathological accumulation of ECM and increased trabecular meshwork (TM) stiffness are major contributors to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), and this has led to preclinical investigations of TGF‐β inhibition as a therapeutic avenue. Although LY2109761 has not been directly trialed for IOP modulation, its use in related fibrotic conditions provides a rationale for a repurposing strategy (Nagaraj & Datta, 2010).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, LY2109761 functions by competitively binding to the ATP‐binding site within the kinase domain of both TGF‐β receptor type I (ALK5) and type II. This binding prevents the autophosphorylation events required for receptor activation, thereby halting the initiation of intracellular signaling cascades (Ling & Lee, 2011; Li et al., 2008). The inhibition of receptor kinase activity leads to suppression of both the canonical (SMAD‐dependent) pathway and noncanonical pathways such as the MAPK cascade (e.g., ERK, JNK, and p38). More specifically, by preventing the phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3, LY2109761 stops the formation of the SMAD complex that translocates into the nucleus to drive the transcription of profibrotic genes, including those encoding for ECM proteins (collagen, fibronectin) and key contractile elements such as α‐smooth muscle actin (α‐SMA) (Markell, 2010; Nagaraj & Datta, 2010). In addition, inhibition of the MAPK noncanonical pathways may further decrease cell proliferation, migration, and contractility. Such dual blockade is particularly advantageous in tissues, like the trabecular meshwork, where TGF‐β signaling is known to drive ECM synthesis and stiffness, both of which can increase outflow resistance and elevate IOP (Ogata et al., 2024; Shim et al., 2021). The molecular interactions include specific hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts within the receptor’s ATP-binding cleft, supporting high specificity and potency of LY2109761 for inhibiting TGF‐β receptor kinases (Li et al., 2008).

Expected Effect:
In the context of glaucoma, the central hypothesis is that LY2109761 will reduce the fibrotic remodeling of the trabecular meshwork by blocking TGF‐β receptor signaling. Trabecular meshwork cells express TGF‐β receptors and are known to respond to elevated levels of TGF‐β2 by increasing ECM production and contractility, thereby increasing resistance to aqueous humor outflow and raising IOP (Nagaraj & Datta, 2010; Shim et al., 2021). The expected effect of LY2109761 in this assay is that by dual‐blocking both receptor isoforms, it will inhibit SMAD phosphorylation and downstream transcriptional upregulation of profibrotic genes, which in turn will result in reduced ECM synthesis, decreased cellular contractility, and an overall softening of the trabecular meshwork. Furthermore, the compound is expected to attenuate noncanonical MAPK pathway activation that may contribute further to cell motility and contraction (Zhang et al., 2018). Experimental readouts in relevant in vitro assays (e.g., primary trabecular meshwork cell cultures) would include decreased levels of phosphorylated SMAD2/3, lower expression of ECM proteins (such as collagen I and fibronectin), and diminished contractile properties (as measured by collagen gel contraction assays) (Cheng et al., 2020; Markell, 2010). In the specialized setting of glaucoma research, where alterations in trabecular meshwork function directly impact aqueous humor outflow, the broad blockade of TGF‐β signaling afforded by LY2109761 offers a compelling mechanism to lower IOP via modification of the cellular microenvironment (Ogata et al., 2024; Shim et al., 2021). Moreover, given that TGF‐β levels are known to be elevated in the aqueous humor of glaucoma patients, the target engagement by LY2109761 is both mechanistically rational and therapeutically promising (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of LY2109761 as a therapeutic candidate for glaucoma is promising but comes with several considerations. From a strengths standpoint, LY2109761 benefits from a well‐characterized mechanism of action involving the dual inhibition of TGF‐β receptor type I and II. This broad receptor blockade addresses receptor redundancy and has the potential to inhibit both SMAD-dependent and noncanonical MAPK pathways, which are key drivers of ECM synthesis and increased cell contractility in the trabecular meshwork (Li et al., 2008; Nagaraj & Datta, 2010). The compound’s preclinical anti‐fibrotic efficacy in other organ systems—such as in liver and pancreatic models—provides supportive evidence of its capability to modulate fibrotic pathways, suggesting that similar antifibrotic mechanisms could ameliorate the pathological remodeling seen in glaucoma (Luangmonkong et al., 2018; Markell, 2010). Furthermore, its documented oral bioavailability and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles reported in earlier studies enhance its translational potential for repurposing into ocular indications, even though topical ocular formulations may be further optimized (Ling & Lee, 2011; Melisi et al., 2008).

On the other hand, there are weaknesses and gaps to be addressed. To date, there is limited direct preclinical or clinical evidence of LY2109761 being used for ocular conditions such as glaucoma. Most studies have focused on cancer and visceral fibrosis; hence, the specific effects on trabecular meshwork cells and the outflow facility have yet to be established experimentally. Animal model data for glaucoma that directly measure IOP changes following LY2109761 administration are lacking in the current literature, and this represents a significant gap (ClinicalTrials.gov; Nagaraj & Datta, 2010). In addition, while dual receptor inhibition is a theoretical strength in terms of pathway suppression, it may also carry higher risks of off-target effects and potential side effects, given the ubiquitous role of TGF‐β signaling in tissue homeostasis, wound healing, immune regulation, and cell proliferation. Such safety and tolerability issues would need to be rigorously evaluated in the ocular context, where local immune responses and wound repair mechanisms are critical (Ogata et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov). Moreover, proper dosing strategies and formulation studies need to be developed to ensure appropriate drug bioavailability in the trabecular meshwork without toxicity to neighboring ocular tissues. Notably, the biochemical studies in corneal endothelial cells – although not directly in trabecular meshwork cells – provide encouraging evidence that LY2109761 can suppress TGF‐β-induced cellular transformation and ECM production, which indirectly supports its potential utility in glaucoma (Zhang et al., 2018).

In summary, the repurposing of LY2109761 for glaucoma is scientifically justified by its mechanism of dual TGF‐β receptor inhibition that can abrogate both SMAD‐dependent and noncanonical pro-fibrotic signaling cascades. The compound’s background in oncology and fibrotic disease models indicates that it has robust target engagement and anti-fibrotic properties. If applied to trabecular meshwork cells, the expected outcomes would be reduced ECM deposition, decreased cellular contractility, and improved aqueous humor outflow – all contributing to lower intraocular pressure. However, the major challenges remain in translating these biochemical effects into clinically demonstrable benefits in glaucoma, as direct preclinical IOP data are not yet available and safety parameters specific to the eye need to be well defined. Overall, LY2109761 represents a promising candidate for further investigation in glaucoma, with the primary strengths being its well‐defined mechanism of action and previous demonstration of antifibrotic efficacy, while the key weaknesses lie in the current lack of direct ocular data and the need for careful evaluation of off-target effects in an ocular environment (Nagaraj & Datta, 2010; Shim et al., 2021; Ogata et al., 2024).

"Calcipotriol, a vitamin D analog.","Proposal for Calcipotriol, a vitamin D analog.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Calcipotriol is a synthetic vitamin D3 analogue originally derived by chemically modifying 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (the active hormonal form of vitamin D3) to reduce its calcemic activity while retaining biologic efficacy toward the vitamin D receptor (VDR) (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022). This compound belongs to the class of vitamin D analogues that have been extensively used in dermatology for conditions such as psoriasis due to their ability to modulate cell proliferation and differentiation via nuclear receptor activation (Chan et al., 2022). Calcipotriol was discovered through a process of structure–activity relationship optimization aimed at retaining VDR binding specificity while reducing the bioactivity that leads to hypercalcemia, a common drawback with native calcitriol in systemic applications (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022). Its synthetic origin and chemical modifications also place calcipotriol in a category of drugs that have been repurposed in several experimental paradigms, demonstrating that the modulation of VDR signaling can have pleiotropic effects across various tissues (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, calcipotriol has been primarily used in the treatment of psoriasis and other hyperproliferative skin disorders because of its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, which are mediated through VDR activation (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022). Its excellent tolerability profile when applied topically in dermatological conditions is well established, and multiple repurposing studies have further confirmed its low systemic toxicity, making it an attractive candidate for potential ocular applications (Chan et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although there is currently limited direct clinical evidence for calcipotriol’s use in treating glaucoma, the literature contains several preclinical and observational studies that provide supportive mechanistic rationales for such repurposing. For instance, vitamin D and its active analogues have been evaluated in various animal models of ocular disease to determine their anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects, and certain studies have shown that VDR activation by vitamin D compounds can protect ocular tissues such as the trabecular meshwork (TM) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Caban & Lewandowska, 2022; Chan et al., 2022). In the context of fibrosis-related pathologies, particularly those affecting the TM that contribute to the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), calcipotriol’s potential mechanism of action is especially intriguing despite the absence of direct clinical trial data in glaucoma patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
The central premise of calcipotriol’s action is its binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a nuclear receptor that forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) upon activation, leading to modulation of gene transcription in target cells (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022). In the trabecular meshwork cells of the eye, VDR activation by calcipotriol is hypothesized to antagonize the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, notably inhibiting SMAD3-mediated transcriptional activities that promote extracellular matrix (ECM) protein overexpression and aberrant cell contractility (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; Caban & Lewandowska, 2022). Mechanistically, TGF-β, particularly TGF-β2, drives fibrotic remodeling in TM cells by inducing a cascade that involves phosphorylation of SMAD3, its nuclear translocation, and subsequent upregulation of pro-fibrotic markers such as fibronectin, collagen, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022). By activating VDR, calcipotriol is expected to interfere with these SMAD3-driven responses—possibly by competitive binding or by modulating the expression of inhibitory SMADs—thereby decreasing ECM deposition and reducing cellular stiffness within the TM (Caban & Lewandowska, 2022; Kutuzova et al., 2012). The molecular interactions involve the VDR-RXR complex binding to vitamin D response elements (VDREs) in the promoters of target genes, which can lead to downregulation of pro-fibrotic genes and upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that facilitate ECM turnover (Reins & McDermott, 2015; Morelli-Batters et al., 2022). Preclinical models have shown that modulation of these pathways can result in improved aqueous humor outflow dynamics as a consequence of decreased TM cell contractility and normalized ECM remodeling, ultimately lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) (Kutuzova et al., 2012; Chan et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
Based on the proposed mechanism, the expected therapeutic effect of calcipotriol in the glaucoma context is the alleviation of increased IOP through improvements in aqueous humor outflow. This is anticipated to be achieved by reducing the fibrotic remodeling of the trabecular meshwork via attenuation of the TGF-β/SMAD3 signaling axis, leading to diminished ECM protein expression and a decrease in cell contractility in TM cells (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; Kutuzova et al., 2012). In vitro studies have demonstrated that vitamin D analogues, including calcitriol (and by extension, its analogs such as calcipotriol), can counteract oxidative stress-induced damage and suppress the expression of pro-fibrotic markers in human TM cells (Caban & Lewandowska, 2022; Mrugacz et al., 2024). Additionally, in preclinical models, topical administration of vitamin D analogues has been associated with modest yet significant improvements in outflow facility, suggestive of enhanced aqueous humor drainage pathways; although these studies often focus on compounds like 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and related analogs, the underlying mechanism is proposed to be similar for calcipotriol (Kutuzova et al., 2012; Krefting et al., 2014). Furthermore, genetic studies linking VDR polymorphisms to glaucoma risk provide indirect support for the importance of VDR signaling in TM function and IOP regulation (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; Caban & Lewandowska, 2022). Thus, in an assay measuring TM cell contractility or ECM protein expression, exposure to calcipotriol is expected to result in the suppression of pro-fibrotic gene expression patterns and a reduction in the mechanical properties that impede aqueous humor outflow (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; Chan et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
The therapeutic candidate calcipotriol presents a compelling rationale for repurposing in glaucoma treatment based on its robust activation of the vitamin D receptor and its downstream modulation of fibrosis-related signaling pathways. One significant strength of calcipotriol is its well-established ocular safety profile derived from extensive dermatological use, which reduces the apprehension of potential toxicity in off-target tissues, including the eye (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, the mechanistic basis of its action—namely, the interference with SMAD3-mediated TGF-β transcriptional activity—has been validated in multiple models of fibrosis in non-ocular tissues, and there is emerging preclinical evidence showing that similar vitamin D analogues can rescue trabecular meshwork cell function (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; Kutuzova et al., 2012). The molecular pathway involving VDR activation has been well characterized, and the presence of VDR in trabecular meshwork cells supports the notion that calcipotriol could modulate intrinsic fibrotic processes in the eye (Caban & Lewandowska, 2022; Chan et al., 2022).

However, there are several caveats and potential weaknesses to consider. Despite the appealing mechanistic rationale, direct preclinical studies specifically assessing the efficacy of calcipotriol in glaucoma models—particularly those focusing on TM cell contractility, ECM remodeling, and intraocular pressure changes—are notably sparse in the current literature (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Caban & Lewandowska, 2022). Most evidence is inferential, based on studies with other vitamin D analogues or calcitriol itself, making it necessary to conduct targeted experiments to directly evaluate calcipotriol’s effects on the trabecular meshwork (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; Kutuzova et al., 2012). Additionally, while the safety profile in dermatology is favorable, the ocular pharmacokinetics and local tolerability of calcipotriol when administered topically to the eye require rigorous assessment because the ocular environment presents unique barriers to drug penetration and retention (Chan et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). There is also a need to better define the optimal dosing regimen and delivery methods to ensure that effective concentrations reach the trabecular meshwork without inducing off-target effects or local irritation. Furthermore, although VDR signaling modulates multiple fibrotic and inflammatory pathways, the complex interplay with SMAD-independent pathways (such as MAPK or Rho kinase signaling) may also influence trabecular meshwork physiology and could potentially limit the efficacy of a single-agent approach (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; Reins & McDermott, 2015).

Despite these challenges, the cumulative preclinical evidence supports further investigation of calcipotriol as a repurposed therapeutic for glaucoma, particularly as current glaucoma therapies primarily focus on lowering IOP without directly addressing the underlying ECM dysregulation and fibrotic changes in the trabecular meshwork (Morelli-Batters et al., 2022; Kutuzova et al., 2012). Its mechanism based on nuclear receptor crosstalk, anti-fibrotic action, and potential neuroprotective properties (as suggested by related vitamin D analogues) provides a novel angle that could complement existing treatments and reduce the risk of disease progression by targeting the root causes of trabecular meshwork dysfunction (Caban & Lewandowska, 2022; Reins & McDermott, 2015). In summary, the strengths of calcipotriol include its established safety profile, well-characterized mechanism of VDR activation, and promising antifibrotic effects shown in related models. Its weaknesses lie in the current lack of direct preclinical and clinical data specifically evaluating its role in modulating trabecular meshwork function and aqueous humor dynamics in glaucoma. These considerations warrant further focused experimental studies and carefully designed clinical trials to establish the therapeutic potential of calcipotriol in glaucoma management (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kutuzova et al., 2012).

Overall, while the preclinical rationale and safety profile are supportive, additional in vitro, in vivo, and ultimately, clinical evidence is necessary to unequivocally validate calcipotriol as a repurposed drug candidate for glaucoma.

────────────────────────
Overview of Therapeutic Candidate

PXS-5153A is a synthetically derived small‐molecule inhibitor that belongs to the fluoroallylamine class of mechanism‐based compounds targeting the lysyl oxidase family. In particular, this molecule has been designed to inhibit lysyl oxidase‐like 2 (LOXL2) as well as LOXL3. Its chemical design is rooted in extensive medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at overcoming the limitations seen with earlier LOX inhibitors such as β‐aminopropionitrile (BAPN) and with antibody therapeutics like Simtuzumab. Unlike BAPN—which showed nonspecificity and toxicity—and the much larger antibody-based inhibitors that suffered from poor tissue penetration, PXS-5153A is engineered to provide both oral bioavailability and improved access to target tissues. Its molecular structure is built around a fluoroallylamine moiety that, upon binding within the enzyme’s active site, undergoes a fluoride elimination reaction. This triggers the formation of a reactive intermediate that irreversibly covalently modifies the lysyl tyrosylquinone (LTQ) cofactor of LOXL2, effectively “locking” the enzyme in an inactive state (Cano et al., 2023; Smithen et al., 2019).

This candidate was uncovered in research programs originally focused on anti-fibrotic and anti-tumor strategies. The fluoroallylamine-based inhibitors were developed to maximize potency and selectivity for LOXL2’s catalytic domain while minimizing off-target interactions. Compared to earlier LOXL2 inhibitors (including antibody-based approaches and earlier small molecules), PXS-5153A is characterized by a small molecular weight that enhances its potential for penetrating dense extracellular matrices (ECMs) such as those found in the trabecular meshwork of the eye. Because the TM’s biomechanical properties are dictated in part by the degree of collagen crosslinking, a small molecule like PXS-5153A carries the promise of reaching these tissues and altering the pathogenic extracellular matrix remodeling processes behind glaucomatous pathology (Romero et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022).

The synthetic origin of PXS-5153A permits iterative structure–activity relationship (SAR) modifications that can further improve its bioavailability, solubility, tissue distribution, and specificity. This feature is particularly important in an ophthalmic context, where the properties of the drug must be finely tuned to overcome barriers such as the blood–ocular barrier and to ensure that only the diseased tissue is affected without disrupting normal ocular homeostasis (Smithen et al., 2019).

────────────────────────
Therapeutic History

The therapeutic history of LOXL2 inhibitors as a class has largely been focused on addressing pathological fibrosis and tumor stroma formation. PXS-5153A has been evaluated in several preclinical models of fibrotic disease, such as liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride exposure and myocardial infarction models. In these studies, administration of PXS-5153A led to significant reductions in hydroxyproline content—a reliable biomarker for collagen deposition—and a measurable improvement in tissue architecture and elasticity (Romero et al., 2020; Vallet & Ricard-Blum, 2019). This therapeutic history underscores the central hypothesis that inhibiting LOXL2-mediated collagen crosslinking can reverse or mitigate the progression of fibrosis.

In the oncology space, LOXL2 inhibitors have been explored for their ability to modulate tumor microenvironments. LOXL2 plays an important role in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix within tumors, thereby facilitating cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Preclinical studies demonstrated that small molecule inhibitors of LOXL2 could delay tumor growth by reducing the density and stiffness of the tumor stroma (Cano et al., 2023; Findlay et al., 2019). These findings have contributed to the broader understanding that abnormal collagen crosslinking is a universal factor across a spectrum of fibrotic and neoplastic diseases.

When it comes to ocular applications, specifically glaucoma, there is as yet no published clinical trial data directly linking PXS-5153A or any other LOXL2 inhibitor to improved outcomes in glaucoma patients. However, several preclinical observations and theoretical models offer a compelling rationale for repurposing these agents in glaucoma. For instance, the Open Targets data indicates a potential, albeit low, association between LOXL2 and glaucoma-related disease processes (Ochoa et al., 2023). Given that excessive LOXL2 activity contributes to fibrosis in diverse tissues, and because the trabecular meshwork (TM) in glaucoma is characterized by increased collagen crosslinking and stiffness, there is a strong conceptual and biochemical rationale to explore the role of PXS-5153A in normalizing TM tissue properties (Cano et al., 2023).

Moreover, earlier clinical trials with other LOXL2 inhibitors, such as antibody therapeutics like Simtuzumab, failed to show efficacy due to challenges with sufficient target inhibition and poor tissue penetration (Perryman & Gray, 2022). The small-molecule nature of PXS-5153A is expected to overcome these drawbacks. In systemic fibrotic diseases like myelofibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, trials of similar LOXL2 inhibitors (for example, PAT-1251 or GB2064) reached early stages, providing additional proof-of-concept that effective LOXL2 inhibition can translate into clinical effects. Although these trials were not performed in the context of glaucoma, they contribute to the general therapeutic history that supports the hypothesis (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021).

────────────────────────
Mechanism of Action

PXS-5153A exerts its pharmacological action by irreversibly inhibiting the catalytic activities of LOXL2 and LOXL3. Under normal physiological conditions, LOXL2 serves as a copper-dependent amine oxidase responsible for the oxidative deamination of lysine and hydroxylysine residues in collagen and elastin fibers. This biochemical transformation produces reactive aldehyde groups on collagen molecules that subsequently undergo spontaneous condensation reactions to form covalent crosslinks. These crosslinks are essential for imparting mechanical stability and tensile strength to the extracellular matrix (Romero et al., 2020).

The irreversible inhibition provided by PXS-5153A is achieved through a two-step mechanism. First, the inhibitor binds non-covalently and positions itself within the catalytic pocket of LOXL2 where it interacts with the LTQ cofactor—a crucial prosthetic group required for the enzyme’s activity. Once positioned correctly, the fluoroallylamine moiety of PXS-5153A undergoes a chemical transformation; specifically, it eliminates a fluoride ion, generating a highly reactive intermediate. This reactive species then covalently bonds with specific amino acid residues in the active site of LOXL2, causing permanent inactivation of the enzyme’s catalytic function (Smithen et al., 2019; Romero et al., 2020).

The dual targeting of both LOXL2 and LOXL3 is particularly important. In complex biological systems, inhibition of a single lysyl oxidase isoform may provoke compensatory upregulation of other family members. By concurrently inhibiting LOXL2 and LOXL3, PXS-5153A minimizes the risk of redundancy and helps ensure a more complete suppression of collagen crosslinking activity. This dual inhibition strategy has been shown in preclinical models to lead to a significant reduction in hydroxyproline levels—an indicator of collagen deposition—and improvement in tissue compliance (Cano et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022).

At the biochemical level, this inhibition is “mechanism-based” because the inhibitor exploits the natural catalytic mechanism of the enzyme itself. Once the covalent adduct is formed, LOXL2 remains in an inactive state until new enzyme molecules are synthesized by the cell. This characteristic renders the inhibitory effect long lasting relative to reversible inhibitors. The use of activity-based probes in these studies has further confirmed that PXS-5153A achieves high levels of target engagement at low nanomolar concentrations, suggesting that the inhibitor is both potent and selective for its intended targets (Findlay et al., 2019).

Given that the pathology in fibrotic diseases and the aberrant biomechanics of the trabecular meshwork in glaucoma are both driven by excessive collagen crosslinking, the molecular details underpinning PXS-5153A’s mechanism make it particularly attractive for use in ocular conditions. The enzyme’s catalytic domain is highly conserved in TM cells, and preliminary immunohistochemical studies suggest that members of the lysyl oxidase family, including LOXL2, are expressed in the trabecular meshwork (Yemanyi, 2020). It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that the same mechanism leading to reduced collagen crosslinking in liver or lung fibrosis could be applied to the TM in an ocular setting.

────────────────────────
Expected Effect in Glaucoma

The central hypothesis for repurposing PXS-5153A in glaucoma is that by inhibiting LOXL2-mediated collagen crosslinking, the drug will reduce the stiffness of the trabecular meshwork ECM—a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. In a healthy eye, the trabecular meshwork plays a key role in regulating intraocular pressure (IOP) by facilitating the outflow of aqueous humor. In glaucomatous eyes, increased deposition and crosslinking of collagen in the TM leads to tissue stiffening, which in turn increases the resistance to aqueous humor outflow and elevates IOP. Elevated IOP is known to be a major risk factor for the progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

Preclinical models of other fibrotic diseases have clearly demonstrated that inhibition of LOXL2 using PXS-5153A reduces hydroxyproline content and improves the biomechanical properties of tissues (Romero et al., 2020). Extrapolating these findings to the ocular context, administration of PXS-5153A is expected to lead to a decrease in the formation of new collagen crosslinks within the trabecular meshwork, thereby reducing tissue stiffness. With reduced stiffness, the TM should become more compliant and better able to facilitate aqueous humor drainage, ultimately resulting in lower intraocular pressure (Yemanyi, 2020).

Furthermore, the expected benefits extend beyond mere alterations in tissue biomechanics. The trabecular meshwork is not a static structure; it is highly responsive to mechanical cues. In a stiffened TM, mechanotransductive signaling pathways are activated in a manner that promotes a feed-forward loop of cellular contraction and further fibrotic remodeling. By reducing collagen crosslink density and normalizing the ECM, PXS-5153A may interrupt these abnormal signaling cascades. A decrease in the mechanical stress experienced by TM cells could lead to reduced cellular contraction, diminished secretion of pro-fibrotic factors (such as TGF-β1), and ultimately, a more homeostatic cellular environment. These changes could help stabilize or even reverse the pathological outflow resistance characteristic of glaucomatous eyes.

On a molecular level, the inhibition of LOXL2 is thought to benefit the TM by preventing the establishment of excessive covalent crosslinks among collagen fibrils. Such crosslinking not only increases stiffness but also influences the organization and alignment of collagen fibers. It is anticipated that treatment with PXS-5153A would promote remodeling of the ECM to a state that more closely resembles that of a non-diseased TM. In effect, the drug may contribute to a restoration of the normal dynamic range of tissue elasticity that is crucial for proper function. This restorative potential is directly related to the irreversible mode of inhibition exhibited by PXS-5153A; once LOXL2 is inactivated, the turnover of collagen will eventually lead to a softer ECM structure, assuming that new collagen is secreted in the absence of excessive crosslinking (Romero et al., 2020).

It is also important to note that while the expected outcomes are derived from robust preclinical data in non-ocular models, extrapolation to the eye requires careful consideration of ocular pharmacokinetics and tissue-specific dynamics. The small-molecule nature of PXS-5153A is advantageous in this regard because it allows for potential formulations that can achieve therapeutically effective concentrations in the anterior segment of the eye. Localized delivery methods such as topical eye drops or intravitreal injections may be explored to maximize target tissue exposure while minimizing systemic side effects. The concept of repurposing an agent with known anti-fibrotic activity finds support in the existing literature, where increased LOXL2 expression correlates with fibrotic changes in multiple tissues, including those in the eye implicated in glaucoma pathology (Ochoa et al., 2023; Yemanyi, 2020).

Given that trabecular meshwork cell contraction, coupled with aberrant ECM remodeling, is a critical driver of increased IOP, the anticipated effect of PXS-5153A is to yield improved aqueous outflow facility. This, in turn, should manifest clinically as a reduction in IOP—a primary therapeutic goal in managing glaucoma. Moreover, by addressing the underlying biomechanical abnormalities rather than merely modulating fluid dynamics pharmacologically (as is the case with many current glaucoma therapies), PXS-5153A may offer a disease-modifying approach that could slow or even halt the progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

────────────────────────
Overall Evaluation

The preclinical and biochemical profile of PXS-5153A is compelling when evaluated against the backdrop of glaucoma pathology. One of the principal strengths of this candidate lies in its small-molecule design. This inherently improves its likelihood of penetrating the dense extracellular matrix of the trabecular meshwork—a challenge that has historically limited the efficacy of larger biologic compounds such as monoclonal antibodies (Cano et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022).

Another significant strength of PXS-5153A is its irreversible, mechanism-based inhibition of LOXL2 (and LOXL3). By permanently inactivating these enzymes through covalent modification of the LTQ cofactor, the drug ensures sustained reduction in collagen crosslinking until new enzymes are synthesized. This long-lasting inhibition is particularly attractive in a chronic condition such as glaucoma, where continuous suppression of pathological ECM remodeling may be required to achieve enduring clinical benefits (Smithen et al., 2019; Romero et al., 2020).

Furthermore, the dual inhibition of LOXL2 and LOXL3 can be considered a strategic advantage. Inhibition of a single isoform might trigger compensatory upregulation of related enzymes; by concurrently targeting both isoforms, PXS-5153A may preempt such compensatory mechanisms and thereby provide a more complete normalization of extracellular matrix structure and function. This is particularly important in the trabecular meshwork, where even minor alterations in tissue biomechanics can have marked effects on aqueous humor outflow and IOP regulation (Cano et al., 2023).

Despite these promising attributes, several concerns must be acknowledged. The most significant challenge is the lack of direct preclinical data specifically demonstrating the efficacy of PXS-5153A in ocular models of glaucoma. While the compound has shown marked anti-fibrotic activity in liver, lung, and myocardial models, the trabecular meshwork’s unique anatomical and biochemical environment necessitates a focused evaluation. Detailed studies are required to confirm the expression of LOXL2 in the TM and to assess the degree to which LOXL2-driven collagen crosslinking contributes to the pathologically increased stiffness observed in glaucomatous eyes (Yemanyi, 2020; Ochoa et al., 2023).

Another potential limitation is associated with ocular pharmacokinetics. It is not yet known whether systemic administration of PXS-5153A, or even localized ocular delivery, will achieve sufficiently high concentrations in the trabecular meshwork to effect meaningful biochemical changes. The eye is known to have several barriers that can limit drug penetration, such as the corneal epithelium and blood–aqueous barrier. Formulation development, therefore, will be a crucial step in ensuring that the compound reaches the intended target without causing significant off-target toxicity. Detailed studies exploring absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) within the ocular environment will be indispensable for the future clinical translation of this therapy (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021).

Additionally, while the inhibition of LOXL2 is hypothesized to be beneficial in reducing TM stiffness, it is possible that LOXL2 plays a role in normal ocular homeostasis. Physiological levels of collagen crosslinking are necessary for maintaining the structural integrity of the trabecular meshwork and other ocular tissues. Over-inhibition might, in theory, compromise the normal biomechanical properties required for proper function. This potential safety concern needs to be rigorously investigated in both in vitro and in vivo models before PXS-5153A can be considered safe for ocular use.

From a translational standpoint, the strength of PXS-5153A lies in its foundation on robust preclinical data from other fibrotic models. This history provides a solid scientific rationale for its repurposing to treat glaucoma. Many of the mechanisms that drive fibrosis in systemic tissues are conserved in ocular tissues. Moreover, the emerging consensus from the literature suggests that pathological remodeling of the trabecular meshwork—a process driven by aberrant collagen crosslinking—is a critical contributor to increased outflow resistance and elevated IOP. Therefore, by targeting LOXL2, PXS-5153A promises an innovative approach that differs markedly from existing glaucoma therapies that mainly target aqueous humor dynamics (Romero et al., 2020; Yemanyi, 2020).

The current landscape of glaucoma therapy is dominated by agents that either reduce the production of aqueous humor or improve outflow through pharmacological or surgical means. However, these treatments typically address the symptom of elevated IOP rather than correcting the underlying pathological remodeling of the trabecular meshwork. PXS-5153A, by contrast, offers the possibility of a disease-modifying treatment that works at the molecular level to restore TM biomechanics. This could not only reduce IOP more sustainably but might also slow or reverse the progression of glaucomatous optic neuropathy by altering the disease’s etiological driver.

There is also evidence that supports the translational feasibility of using LOXL2 inhibitors in ocular tissues. Several studies have demonstrated that members of the lysyl oxidase family are expressed in ocular tissues, including the trabecular meshwork, where they may influence ECM homeostasis. In this context, the inhibition provided by PXS-5153A is expected to be beneficial if its formulation and delivery can be optimized to achieve sufficient local concentration. Overall, the strategy of repurposing a potent anti-fibrotic agent like PXS-5153A for glaucoma is appealing because it aims at the very root cause of mechanical outflow resistance—the abnormal extracellular matrix—rather than providing symptom-only relief (Ochoa et al., 2023; Yemanyi, 2020).

Nonetheless, the need for robust ocular-specific preclinical studies cannot be overstated. First, it will be essential to establish that LOXL2 is sufficiently expressed in the glaucomatous trabecular meshwork relative to normal tissue. Secondly, the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of PXS-5153A must be characterized in ocular tissues to define the optimal dosing regimen that achieves effective target engagement without detrimental side effects. Ocular toxicity studies and evaluations of any potential adverse effects on physiological ECM remodeling in benign tissues, such as the corneal stroma, will also be critical for a safe therapeutic profile.

Overall Conclusions and Future Directions

In summary, PXS-5153A exhibits a well-documented anti-fibrotic mechanism of action through its irreversible inhibition of LOXL2 and LOXL3. Its small-molecule nature confers significant advantages in terms of tissue penetration and the possibility of localized ocular delivery. The extensive preclinical evidence from systemic fibrotic disease models provides a compelling rationale for its repurposing as a glaucoma therapeutic by targeting the pathological extracellular matrix remodeling in the trabecular meshwork.

The strengths of PXS-5153A include:
• Its rational, mechanism-based design that exploits the copper-dependent catalytic activity of LOXL2 to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme, thereby reducing pathological collagen crosslinking (Smithen et al., 2019; Romero et al., 2020).
• Its dual inhibition of LOXL2 and LOXL3, which minimizes the risk of compensatory upregulation of other lysyl oxidase family members, ensuring a more complete suppression of extracellular matrix stiffening (Cano et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022).
• Its favorable chemical properties as a small molecule, permitting potential ocular formulations that can overcome the blood–ocular barriers and specifically target the trabecular meshwork.
• Its robust preclinical profile in fibrosis models, which lends substantial credence to the hypothesis that similar mechanisms contribute to trabecular meshwork stiffening in glaucoma (Romero et al., 2020; Yemanyi, 2020).

Conversely, the potential weaknesses or challenges include:
• A current lack of direct evidence from ocular or glaucoma-specific preclinical models to confirm that LOXL2 plays a similarly pivotal role in the trabecular meshwork as it does in liver or lung fibrosis.
• The need to rigorously characterize ocular pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to ensure that effective drug concentrations are achieved in the trabecular meshwork without eliciting adverse effects on normal ocular tissues.
• The possibility that LOXL2 may be involved in the maintenance of normal ECM homeostasis in the eye; thus, an overly potent inhibition could theoretically disrupt necessary physiological processes if not properly controlled.
• The necessity to develop an optimal delivery method—whether through systemic administration with adequate ocular penetration or via localized delivery strategies such as eye drops or intraocular injections—to maximize therapeutic benefits while minimizing systemic exposure.

Future directions for advancing PXS-5153A as a candidate for glaucoma will involve several key steps. Initially, in vitro studies utilizing human trabecular meshwork cells should be conducted to measure LOXL2 expression levels, collagen crosslinking rates, and the biomechanical properties of the ECM in response to PXS-5153A treatment. These studies will help establish whether LOXL2 inhibition can effectively remodel the pathological ECM characteristic of glaucomatous tissue. In parallel, in vivo studies in animal models of glaucoma are needed to assess ocular pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, and the impact on IOP reduction. Given the compound’s promising anti-fibrotic effects in other models, pilot studies focusing on aqueous humor outflow facility and TM stiffness measurements would be critical.

Moreover, research should explore formulation strategies that optimize the delivery of PXS-5153A into the anterior segment of the eye. Advances in nanotechnology, liposomal delivery systems, or other ocular drug delivery platforms may be leveraged to enhance local drug concentration without significant systemic absorption. Safety profiles will need to be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any adverse effects on the cornea, lens, or retinal tissues; only then can the compound progress toward Phase I clinical evaluation for ocular indications.

In conclusion, PXS-5153A represents a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of glaucoma owing to its potent, irreversible inhibition of LOXL2/LOXL3, its demonstrated efficacy in reducing extracellular matrix crosslinking in fibrotic models, and its amenable small-molecule properties that suggest potential for ocular tissue penetration. While its application to glaucoma remains hypothetical pending further targeted preclinical studies, the underlying mechanistic rationale is sound. With rigorous investigation into TM-specific pharmacodynamics, ocular safety, and appropriate delivery modalities, PXS-5153A could emerge as a novel, mechanism-based therapy offering a disease-modifying approach to glaucoma—shifting the treatment paradigm from symptomatic IOP reduction to addressing the underlying biochemical drivers of the disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021; Ochoa et al., 2023; Cano et al., 2023; Romero et al., 2020; Smithen et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022; Yemanyi, 2020).

────────────────────────
Conclusion

The extensive literature reviewed herein provides a robust scientific framework for considering PXS-5153A as a candidate for repurposing in glaucoma treatment. Its synthetic origins, belonging to the fluoroallylamine class, and its irreversible, dual inhibition of LOXL2/LOXL3 are strongly supported by preclinical data from non-ocular fibrotic models. The potential to modulate ECM stiffness via inhibition of collagen crosslinking aligns directly with the mechanistic theories underlying trabecular meshwork dysfunction in glaucoma.

While current clinical data focus primarily on fibrotic diseases and cancer, the parallels between tissue fibrosis in systemic organs and pathological changes in the trabecular meshwork suggest that a similar therapeutic benefit could be realized in the eye. However, several critical gaps remain. Ocular-specific pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological studies must be conducted to validate that PXS-5153A can reach and effectively modulate the TM without adversely affecting normal ocular function.

Overall, the repurposing of PXS-5153A for glaucoma offers a compelling opportunity to address the pathological ECM remodeling that underpins elevated intraocular pressure. With further focused preclinical studies and subsequent clinical trials, this small-molecule LOXL2 inhibitor has the potential to transform our approach to glaucoma therapy—moving toward disease modification through biochemical normalization of the trabecular meshwork.

In light of the promising preclinical antifibrotic activity, the demonstrated efficacy of similar agents in other disease models, and the mechanistic rationale linking LOXL2 activity to ECM stiffness, PXS-5153A stands out as a strong candidate for addressing a critical unmet need in glaucoma treatment. Its future success, however, will depend on close interdisciplinary collaboration and rigorous validation across ocular models before advancing to clinical evaluation (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021; Ochoa et al., 2023; Romero et al., 2020; Smithen et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022; Yemanyi, 2020).

────────────────────────
Final Remarks

To summarize, PXS-5153A’s unique chemical design, mechanism of irreversible LOXL2 inactivation, and proven anti-fibrotic efficacy in preclinical systems collectively support its potential for repurposing in glaucoma therapy. The working hypothesis that reducing LOXL2-driven collagen crosslinking in the trabecular meshwork could lower tissue stiffness and improve aqueous humor outflow is well grounded in current biochemical and pathophysiological knowledge. Challenges remain, particularly in establishing ocular bioavailability and ensuring that vital physiological ECM functions are not compromised—but these challenges are not insurmountable. With continued preclinical validation, optimization of ocular delivery, and interdisciplinary collaboration, PXS-5153A could offer a first-in-class, mechanism-based treatment modality that directly targets the pathogenic cascade of glaucomatous disease rather than merely treating its symptomatic consequences.

In conclusion, this evaluation supports further investigation into PXS-5153A as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma. If successful, this strategy could not only reduce intraocular pressure but also modify underlying tissue pathology, providing a significant advancement in the management of a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021; Ochoa et al., 2023; Romero et al., 2020; Smithen et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022; Yemanyi, 2020).

SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich cat. S4317).,"Proposal for SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich cat. S4317).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SB431542 is a synthetic small‐molecule compound that belongs to the class of selective ALK5 (TGF-β receptor type I kinase) inhibitors. It was originally discovered through high-throughput screening efforts designed to identify candidates that could block the ATP binding site of TGF-β receptors and thereby inhibit their kinase activity. As a member of the kinase inhibitor class, SB431542 is chemically tractable and has been widely used as a research tool in various cellular and biochemical assays to dissect TGF-β signaling. Its synthesis and characterization by companies like Sigma-Aldrich (catalog number S4317) have established it as a prototypical inhibitor in studies focused on fibrotic diseases and cancer, where aberrant TGF-β signaling plays a central role (Markell, 2010; Montecchi-Palmer et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
Biochemically, SB431542 has been extensively validated in vitro and in preclinical studies as a selective inhibitor of TGF-β receptor I (ALK5). It has served as a tool compound in numerous studies investigating the fibrotic response in various tissues. For example, its ability to prevent TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3 has been employed in collagen gel contraction assays and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition assays in diverse cell types. In addition to its use in studies of renal fibrosis and tumor biology, SB431542 has been applied to research on ocular fibrosis. Although direct clinical trial data using SB431542 in glaucoma are limited, its mechanism of action has been the basis for proposing ALK5 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in glaucoma. The extensive literature focusing on TGF-β’s role in trabecular meshwork (TM) cell dysfunction and ECM remodeling in glaucoma supports this repurposing approach (Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Pervan et al., 2016). While no veterinary use as a registered glaucoma therapy has been reported, the therapeutic class – small-molecule kinase inhibitors – has a strong precedent in other fibrotic diseases, and several agents in this category are in clinical development, further supporting the translational feasibility of SB431542 for ocular indications (Prendes et al., 2013; Webber et al., 2016).

Mechanism of Action:
SB431542 acts by competitively inhibiting the ATP binding site of the ALK5 receptor, effectively blocking the kinase activity required for downstream signal transduction. In normal TGF-β signaling, binding of TGF-β ligands to their receptor complex—which includes TGF-β receptor II and the type I receptor ALK5—leads to phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smads (Smad2 and Smad3). The phosphorylated Smads then complex with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus, where they activate the transcription of pro-fibrotic genes such as those encoding collagen type I, collagen type III, and fibronectin. This cascade is important in driving the fibrotic response and promoting actomyosin contractility. SB431542, by inhibiting ALK5, effectively prevents Smad2/3 phosphorylation, thereby abrogating the transcription of these pro-fibrotic genes. This mechanism is supported by a plethora of in vitro studies—including collagen gel contraction assays in human trabecular meshwork cells—where SB431542 was shown to block TGF-β–induced contraction and ECM deposition (Markell, 2010; Montecchi-Palmer et al., 2017). Its chemical specificity for the TGF-β receptor I has been well documented, with studies demonstrating minimal off-target effects on related kinases. In short, SB431542 interferes with the core TGF-β/Smad signaling axis by binding to ALK5, reducing both ECM gene transcription and cytoskeletal rearrangements that are responsible for increased cellular contractility (Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis proposes that SB431542 will selectively inhibit ALK5 in trabecular meshwork cells, thereby preventing TGF-β–induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation. This inhibition is expected to result in the abrogation of pro-fibrotic gene transcription—including genes for collagen I, collagen III, and fibronectin—which are normally upregulated in response to TGF-β. Consequently, the treatment should lead to a reduction in extracellular matrix accumulation and actomyosin contractility within the TM cells. Since the trabecular meshwork is critical for regulating aqueous humor outflow, reducing ECM deposition and cellular stiffness is anticipated to improve outflow facility, thereby lowering intraocular pressure (IOP), a key modifiable risk factor in glaucoma. Evidence supporting this expected effect comes from several in vitro studies performed on TM cells that demonstrate TGF-β–induced contraction and ECM remodeling can be mitigated by ALK5 inhibition (Pervan et al., 2016; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012). Moreover, the expression of TGF-β receptors and Smad proteins in TM cells has been well documented, and their role in pathological ECM remodeling in glaucoma has been firmly established (Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009; Rao & Stubbs, 2021). In theory, by interfering with these signaling events, SB431542 should normalize cellular contractility and reduce the stiffness of the trabecular meshwork, resulting in enhanced aqueous outflow and decreased IOP.

Overall Evaluation:
SB431542 represents a promising repurposed candidate for glaucoma therapy based on several strengths. First, its mechanism of action is well understood and directly targets a key signaling pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma—the ALK5-mediated TGF-β/Smad pathway—which drives ECM accumulation and aberrant cellular contractility in the trabecular meshwork (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Pervan et al., 2016). This specificity provides mechanistic clarity and ensures that the inhibitor acts precisely where it is needed in the context of pathological TM remodeling. Second, SB431542 is chemically tractable and has been extensively validated in vitro, with robust data demonstrating its ability to block TGF-β–induced phosphorylation events, reduce fibrotic gene expression, and prevent cell contraction in various cellular systems. Its use in collagen gel contraction assays in human TM cells supports its potential to improve aqueous outflow by reversing TGF-β–driven contractility changes (Markell, 2010; Montecchi-Palmer et al., 2017).

Furthermore, the therapeutic rationale is strengthened by substantial evidence from diverse studies that demonstrate the central role of TGF-β in glaucoma pathology. Elevated TGF-β levels in the aqueous humor of glaucomatous eyes have been correlated with increased ECM remodeling and heightened intraocular pressure, and targeting this pathway has been proposed as a viable strategy to restore TM function (Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009; Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012). The compound’s ability to selectively inhibit ALK5 means that it can counteract these pathological processes at a very early stage in the signaling cascade, potentially halting or even reversing fibrotic remodeling in TM cells.

Nonetheless, there are certain weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Although SB431542 has an excellent in vitro profile, there is a relative paucity of direct in vivo or clinical data specifically addressing its efficacy and safety in ocular models of glaucoma. While its overall chemical tractability and safety in preclinical studies bode well for its development, further experiments are needed to determine its pharmacokinetics, ocular bioavailability, and potential off-target effects in the eye. Additionally, chronic inhibition of TGF-β signaling may raise concerns about interfering with physiological wound healing and immune processes elsewhere in the body if systemic exposure is not adequately restricted. Strategies such as local ocular delivery (for example, via sustained-release formulations, as described in related studies for arthrofibrosis) could mitigate these risks (Lee et al., 2021).

In summary, SB431542 is a highly promising candidate for repurposing as a glaucoma therapeutic because it directly targets a fundamental molecular mechanism responsible for TM dysfunction and ECM-mediated outflow resistance. Its selective inhibition of ALK5 and resultant blockade of Smad2/3 phosphorylation and pro-fibrotic gene transcription provide a strong mechanistic rationale for its expected efficacy in improving aqueous humor outflow and reducing intraocular pressure (Pervan et al., 2016; Rao & Stubbs, 2021). While additional preclinical and clinical studies are necessary to fully validate its ocular safety and efficacy, the current body of evidence supports the continued development and evaluation of SB431542 for glaucoma treatment (Fuchshofer & Tamm, 2012; Agarwal & Agarwal, 2009).

"Cilengitide (EMD 121974), an integrin αVβ3/αVβ5 antagonist.","Proposal for Cilengitide (EMD 121974), an integrin αVβ3/αVβ5 antagonist.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Cilengitide (EMD 121974) is a synthetic cyclic pentapeptide composed of an RGD (arginine–glycine–aspartic acid) sequence that has been cyclized to improve stability, binding affinity, and selectivity relative to linear RGD peptides. By virtue of its cyclic structure, cilengitide is resistant to proteolytic degradation and is able to maintain a fixed conformation that optimizes its interaction with target integrins. It was developed through structure–activity relationship studies that aimed to enhance both selectivity and potency for integrins, particularly αvβ3 and αvβ5, which are key receptors mediating cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. This therapeutic candidate belongs to the class of integrin antagonists, compounds which are used to disrupt normal receptor–ligand interactions at the cell surface that trigger focal adhesion formation and downstream signaling cascades. Historically, integrin antagonists have been explored for their ability to block pathological cell adhesion, migration, angiogenesis, and survival signals in a variety of diseases, predominantly in oncology. In this context, cilengitide was initially reported as a potent inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis and metastasis with a particular focus on glioblastoma multiforme, where integrin-mediated signaling plays a critical role in tumor progression (Caporello et al., 2012; Reardon et al., 2011).

Therapeutic History:
Cilengitide has been examined extensively over the past decades, primarily in the field of oncology. Preclinical studies established that cilengitide potently inhibits endothelial cell adhesion and migration through its binding to integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5, both of which are highly expressed in tumor-associated vasculature and in certain tumor cell types. Clinical trials in patients with advanced solid tumors, including glioblastoma multiforme, have demonstrated that cilengitide possesses a favorable safety profile and that it is safe for repeated administration. Phase I and phase II clinical trials have confirmed its tolerability with no maximum tolerated dose reached and provided evidence of target engagement, as well as biological activity indicative of its antiangiogenic effects (Reardon et al., 2008; Reardon et al., 2011). Although its development was driven primarily by oncology applications, no direct clinical trials have yet established its use in glaucoma or related fibrotic conditions. Nonetheless, the mechanistic rationale derived from its integrin-targeting properties has recently inspired interest in repurposing this compound for ocular fibrotic diseases. A number of studies in the retinovascular domain have detailed the potential of integrin antagonists to modulate extracellular matrix interactions and neovascularization, with integrin αvβ3 playing an important role in the activation of latent transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), a key mediator of fibrotic cascades (Bhatwadekar et al., 2020). Furthermore, cyclic RGD peptides structurally and functionally similar to cilengitide have been explored in the context of trabecular meshwork (TM) cell fibrosis—a central process in glaucoma pathology—suggesting that repurposing such an integrin inhibitor may be highly plausible (Hennig et al., 2016; Faralli et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, cilengitide acts as a competitive inhibitor by binding to the RGD recognition site on the integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5. These integrins normally bind extracellular ligands such as vitronectin, fibronectin, and tenascin-C, which contain an RGD motif that facilitates adhesion and subsequent intracellular signaling. By occupying the binding pocket, cilengitide prevents the natural ligands from binding, thereby inhibiting integrin clustering and the formation of focal adhesion complexes. This blockage disrupts the subsequent activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and other downstream signaling pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK cascades that are critical for cell survival, proliferation, and migration (Reardon et al., 2011).

In addition to its direct effects on cell adhesion, integrin αvβ3 is critically involved in the activation of latent TGF-β, a cytokine secreted in a biologically inactive—or latent—complex bound to the ECM. The conformational changes and physical forces transmitted through the actin cytoskeleton via focal adhesion complexes enable integrin αvβ3 to induce a structural rearrangement in the latent TGF-β complex, thereby releasing active TGF-β. In the trabecular meshwork, high integrin αvβ3 expression has been linked to elevated activation of TGF-β, which then stimulates a fibrotic response characterized by increased deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin and collagen, and an abnormal increase in cell contractility mediated by downstream signaling events involving Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) and the Hippo pathway effectors Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) and Transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) (Bhatwadekar et al., 2020; Hennig et al., 2016). These signaling pathways contribute to enhanced focal adhesion assembly, cytoskeletal reorganization, and extracellular matrix stiffening—changes that directly correlate with decreased aqueous outflow, leading to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma. By antagonizing αvβ3 and αvβ5, cilengitide is hypothesized to block this chain of events early in the cascade: it will prevent integrin-mediated activation of latent TGF-β, thereby reducing the subsequent stimulation of ROCK and YAP/TAZ signaling and ultimately suppressing aberrant fibrotic ECM remodeling (Irnaten et al., 2024; Reardon et al., 2011).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed application for glaucoma, the expected effect of cilengitide is to disrupt the fibrotic processes within the trabecular meshwork (TM) that contribute to increased outflow resistance and elevated intraocular pressure, which are hallmarks of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Specifically, in vitro and in vivo assays using TM cells exposed to pro-fibrotic stimuli (such as elevated levels of latent TGF-β) should demonstrate that cilengitide treatment leads to:

1. A significant inhibition of integrin αvβ3-mediated activation of latent TGF-β. Since integrin αvβ3 is highly expressed in TM cells and is responsible for initiating the conversion of latent TGF-β into its active form, cilengitide should lower the levels of active TGF-β in the TM microenvironment (Bhatwadekar et al., 2020; Faralli et al., 2019).

2. A reduction in downstream signal transduction pathways, particularly those mediated by ROCK and the YAP/TAZ transcriptional regulators. Disruption of these signaling cascades would be evident through a decrease in markers such as phosphorylated ERK1/2, reduced stress fiber formation, and a diminishment in the nuclear accumulation of YAP/TAZ. These molecular changes can be quantitatively assessed using Western blot assays and immunocytochemistry (Irnaten et al., 2024; Hennig et al., 2016).

3. A decrease in the expression and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin and collagen, which are typically upregulated by TGF-β activation and integrin-mediated signaling. Molecular assays measuring mRNA and protein levels for fibronectin, collagen, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) would be anticipated to show lower values following treatment with cilengitide, reflecting an attenuation of fibrotic remodeling in TM cells (Bhatwadekar et al., 2020; Faralli et al., 2023).

4. An overall improvement in the biomechanical properties of the trabecular meshwork. Ex vivo models or animal studies should reveal that cilengitide-treated TM tissue exhibits reduced stiffness and improved aqueous humor outflow facility. Enhanced outflow performance would be reflected in a measurable reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) via tonometric or perfusion assay methods (Filla et al., 2019; Faralli et al., 2023).

Given that integrin-targeted cyclic RGD peptides have demonstrated the ability to reduce connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)-induced fibrotic responses in human TM cells—with significant reductions in ECM protein production and focal adhesion remodeling—the analogous mechanism attributed to cilengitide supports the rationale that it could yield similar beneficial outcomes in glaucoma treatment by inhibiting the upstream activators of fibrosis (Hennig et al., 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
The potential for repurposing cilengitide as a therapeutic agent for glaucoma is supported by a robust mechanistic rationale and a substantial foundational body of literature regarding its integrin antagonism. Its high affinity and selectivity for integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5, which are fundamentally involved in integrin-mediated activation of latent TGF-β in the trabecular meshwork, form the basis for its proposed effectiveness. The strengths of cilengitide in this context include:

• A well-characterized molecular mechanism of action that disrupts critical integrin–ECM interactions. By occupying the RGD binding sites on αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins, the compound prevents the integrin-mediated conformational changes required for TGF-β activation. This early intervention in the pathogenic cascade is a significant strength as it targets the upstream drivers of fibrotic remodeling in the TM (Reardon et al., 2011; Bhatwadekar et al., 2020).

• An established clinical safety profile from extensive oncology trials. The favorable pharmacokinetics and tolerability observed in patients with advanced solid tumors provide a strong precedent for its potential repurposing. Although the tissue environments differ, the clinical experience serves as a significant advantage in terms of risk reduction when considering repositioning (Reardon et al., 2008; Hariharan et al., 2007).

• The capacity to interrupt a pathogenic feed-forward loop between ECM stiffness and pro-fibrotic signaling. In glaucoma, increased ECM deposition in the trabecular meshwork establishes a vicious cycle, wherein elevated stiffness further stimulates integrin-mediated activation of fibrotic cascades. Cilengitide’s mechanism directly addresses this issue by masking the integrin binding sites, thus potentially restoring the dynamic equilibrium needed for normal aqueous outflow (Irnaten et al., 2024; Faralli et al., 2023).

Despite these strengths, several challenges and potential weaknesses should be considered:

• There exists a notable gap in direct preclinical or clinical evidence for cilengitide’s efficacy in ocular tissues or in models of glaucoma. The majority of data derive from oncology studies and studies on retinal and trabecular meshwork cells using similar cyclic RGD peptides rather than cilengitide per se. Therefore, dedicated studies in TM cell cultures and appropriate animal models of glaucoma are essential to validate its purported effects (Bhatwadekar et al., 2020; Reardon et al., 2011).

• The unique microenvironment of the trabecular meshwork, including differences in integrin expression profiles and extracellular matrix composition, may necessitate reformulation or dosing adjustments. Cilengitide’s current mode of administration in oncology has been an intravenous route, and while its pharmacodynamic properties are favorable, achieving sufficient localized concentrations in the TM via ocular delivery may present technical hurdles (Bhatwadekar et al., 2020; Reardon et al., 2008).

• There is evidence from related studies that integrin antagonists can exhibit biphasic effects; at low concentrations, some cyclic RGD peptides have been reported to induce paradoxical integrin activation rather than inhibition. Such effects could potentially counteract the therapeutic goal if dosage is not carefully optimized (Sheldrake & Patterson, 2014).

• Glaucoma pathophysiology is multifactorial, involving not only fibrotic ECM remodeling driven by integrin-mediated TGF-β activation but also contributions from inflammatory processes, oxidative stress, and other non-fibrotic pathways. It is possible that inhibiting integrin signaling alone may not sufficiently address all aspects of disease pathology, which might necessitate combination therapies for optimal efficacy (Irnaten et al., 2024; Faralli et al., 2023).

In summary, cilengitide possesses significant potential as an innovative therapeutic candidate for glaucoma, owing to its precise integrin-targeting mechanism, its solid history in clinical oncology, and the strong mechanistic links between integrin-mediated activation of latent TGF-β and the fibrotic remodeling of the trabecular meshwork. Its hypothesized ability to block integrin αvβ3/αvβ5-mediated TGF-β activation and to disrupt the downstream signal transduction cascades (such as the ROCK and YAP/TAZ pathways) that drive fibrotic ECM deposition could lead to improved aqueous humor outflow and lowered intraocular pressure. However, while the theoretical basis is sound, major gaps remain regarding direct evidence in ocular models. Focused preclinical studies in TM cells and animal models of glaucoma are critical to establish dosing strategies, confirm target engagement in the ocular microenvironment, and rule out any unforeseen compensatory mechanisms. Should these studies prove favorable, formulation and delivery challenges will need to be addressed to transition from an established intravenous oncology drug to an effective ocular therapeutic. With rigorous investigation, cilengitide represents a promising repurposing candidate that may offer a novel upstream intervention for glaucoma by targeting integrin-mediated mechanotransduction and fibrotic signaling (Bhatwadekar et al., 2020; Hennig et al., 2016; Irnaten et al., 2024; Reardon et al., 2011; Sheldrake & Patterson, 2014).

Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me).,"Proposal for Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Bardoxolone methyl, also known as CDDO‐Me, is a fully synthetic oleanane triterpenoid that was originally derived from the naturally occurring compound oleanolic acid found in various plants. It belongs to the class of synthetic triterpenoids, a group of compounds that have been engineered to improve on the natural structure for enhanced potency and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. These compounds are known for their ability to modulate redox homeostasis, regulate inflammation, and exert cytoprotective effects in various tissues. Bardoxolone methyl was discovered through chemical modification strategies that target electrophilic cysteine residues on regulatory proteins, and its design was optimized for potent Nrf2 activation. The development of this structural class has been motivated by a need for molecules that not only scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) directly but also upregulate a broad network of antioxidant enzymes via transcriptional activation. Therefore, Bardoxolone methyl represents a rationally designed compound intended to harness the endogenous cellular defense mechanism regulated by Nrf2 (Nakagami, 2016; Cheng et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Bardoxolone methyl’s therapeutic history is extensive; it has been clinically evaluated in several trials, particularly in chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes and in pulmonary arterial hypertension. It has demonstrated beneficial effects by improving estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and reducing systemic oxidative stress and inflammation in these conditions. The compound has also been explored in various oncological contexts due to its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects through Nrf2 activation. Although its safety profile has been established in non‐ocular settings, Bardoxolone methyl has not yet been directly tested in glaucomatous or ocular disease–specific clinical trials. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov for Bardoxolone methyl in glaucoma and ocular indications returned no registered trials, which suggests that while the clinical history in related systemic diseases is promising, its use in glaucoma remains entirely a repurposing hypothesis at this stage (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Batliwala et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the mechanistic rationale derived from its use in other oxidative stress–related diseases provides a strong preclinical basis to consider its evaluation for glaucoma, a disease closely linked to oxidative damage and fibrotic remodeling in the trabecular meshwork (TM) (Wang et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
Bardoxolone methyl’s mechanism of action centers on the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), which is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is held in the cytoplasm bound by its negative regulatory protein Keap1, which, via its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, targets Nrf2 for proteasomal degradation. Bardoxolone methyl exerts its effect by covalently modifying key cysteine residues on Keap1, thereby disrupting the Keap1-Nrf2 binding complex. This chemical modification prevents the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Nrf2. As a consequence, Nrf2 is stabilized in the cytoplasm, accumulates, and translocates into the nucleus where it binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) present in the promoter regions of target genes. This binding initiates the transcription of a battery of cytoprotective genes encoding antioxidant enzymes and phase II detoxification proteins such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase‐1 (HO‐1), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) and modifier (GCLM) subunits, and various glutathione S-transferases (Nakagami, 2016; Cheng et al., 2021).

Furthermore, Bardoxolone methyl’s activation of Nrf2 also exerts indirect anti-inflammatory actions by suppressing redox-sensitive signaling pathways such as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). The reduction in ROS levels following Nrf2 activation likely also prevents the ROS-mediated activation of latent pro-fibrotic cytokines, particularly transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). In glaucoma, TGF-β is implicated in the pathological remodeling and fibrosis of the trabecular meshwork, which contributes to increased outflow resistance and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). The inhibition of TGF-β activation through reduced oxidative stress represents a key molecular mechanism by which Bardoxolone methyl is hypothesized to preserve TM function (Nakamura et al., 2019; Arana et al., 2020).

In addition, Bardoxolone methyl has been reported to interact with other signaling pathways in various cell types. For example, cross-talk with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway has been observed where Nrf2 activation leads to modulation of PTEN activity—a lipid phosphatase that negatively regulates PI3K/AKT—thereby promoting cell survival and maintaining cytoskeletal integrity. This molecular interplay is critical in tissues susceptible to oxidative damage and may be particularly relevant for TM cells and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in glaucoma (Nakagami, 2016; Cheng et al., 2021). Thus, the well-documented molecular mechanism of Bardoxolone methyl highlights its capacity to induce a robust antioxidant and anti-fibrotic cellular response by activating Nrf2, which is expected to counteract the pathogenic cascade initiated by oxidative stress in glaucoma.

Expected Effect:
The working hypothesis for repurposing Bardoxolone methyl for glaucoma is that by activating Nrf2 in trabecular meshwork (TM) cells, the compound will upregulate endogenous antioxidant enzymes, thereby reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The reduction in ROS is expected to impair the ROS-mediated activation of latent TGF-β present in the TM. Since TGF-β is a potent pro-fibrotic cytokine that drives extracellular matrix remodeling and fibrosis in the TM, inhibiting its activation should help maintain the structural and functional integrity of the TM. Preservation of TM function is crucial for proper aqueous humor outflow, and thereby, for maintaining normal intraocular pressure (IOP). In addition, by mitigating oxidative stress, the drug is also anticipated to provide neuroprotective effects to retinal ganglion cells, which are vulnerable to oxidative and inflammatory damage in glaucoma (Wang et al., 2020; Arana et al., 2020).

Given that Nrf2 is expressed in ocular tissues, including TM cells and retinal ganglion cells, and that its activation has been associated with protection against oxidative damage in these cells, it is reasonable to expect that Bardoxolone methyl will induce similar effects in the eye. Experimental evidence from retinal models has shown that Nrf2 activation reduces superoxide levels and prevents vascular and neuronal degeneration (Wei et al., 2011; Naguib et al., 2021). Moreover, the expected upregulation of cytoprotective genes via the ARE pathway should lead to an increased antioxidant capacity locally within the TM. As a result, reducing the ROS burden would inhibit the feed-forward loop wherein ROS promotes TGF-β activation, which further exacerbates fibrosis and impairs aqueous outflow. This chain of events is critical because the pathological fibrosis of the TM is one of the major contributors to increased IOP in glaucoma (Rao & Stubbs, 2021). Thus, the use of Bardoxolone methyl is expected to yield a twofold benefit in glaucomatous eyes: maintenance of TM cell function and structure and neuroprotection of retinal ganglion cells through enhanced antioxidant defenses (Nakagami, 2016; Naguib et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Bardoxolone methyl stands out as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in glaucoma, owing to its robust mechanism of action and well-documented ability to activate the Nrf2 pathway. One significant strength of this candidate is its dual action, which targets both the antioxidant defense mechanisms and the fibrotic pathways underlying glaucomatous damage. By preventing ROS accumulation and subsequent TGF-β activation in trabecular meshwork cells, Bardoxolone methyl has the potential to preserve aqueous humor outflow and maintain IOP within normal ranges. This mechanistic approach directly addresses a validated pathogenic axis in glaucoma, given that oxidative stress and TM fibrosis are critical drivers of disease progression (Cheng et al., 2021; Rao & Stubbs, 2021).

Another strength is the extensive clinical and preclinical experience with Bardoxolone methyl in other indications. Its safety profile has been explored in chronic kidney disease and pulmonary hypertension, lending translational feasibility to the concept of repurposing it for glaucoma. Furthermore, the biochemical and molecular data demonstrating Bardoxolone methyl’s ability to upregulate antioxidant enzymes via Nrf2 activation in various models provides compelling rationale for its application in ocular tissues, which are likewise susceptible to oxidative injury (Nakagami, 2016; Matsuda et al., 2020).

However, there are inherent challenges and weaknesses that must be carefully considered. The lack of direct clinical or preclinical studies examining Bardoxolone methyl in glaucoma or ocular models leaves a significant gap in the evidence base; most of the supportive data are extrapolated from non-ocular contexts or from retinal studies that focus on neuroprotection rather than on trabecular meshwork function. The pharmacokinetics of Bardoxolone methyl, which were optimized for systemic diseases, may require further modification or targeted delivery strategies to achieve sufficient local concentrations in the eye while minimizing systemic exposure. Advanced drug delivery methods such as nanoformulations or intraocular implants may be necessary to overcome these hurdles (Cheng et al., 2021; Nakamura et al., 2019).

Additionally, although Bardoxolone methyl’s activation of Nrf2 has been shown to induce anti-inflammatory and antioxidative responses, the potential for off-target effects or adverse events, such as cardiovascular complications reported in some CKD trials, warrants caution. The safety profile in an ocular setting might differ, and thorough preclinical toxicology studies focused on ocular tissues and function will be essential. Furthermore, considering that oxidative stress and TGF-β signaling are complex and multifactorial processes in glaucoma, it is possible that monotherapy with Nrf2 activation may not be sufficient to halt disease progression; combination therapies targeting multiple pathogenic pathways might ultimately be more effective (Badla et al., 2024; Nakagami, 2016).

In summary, Bardoxolone methyl exhibits robust mechanistic promise owing to its potent activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway, leading to upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, inhibition of ROS-mediated TGF-β activation, and potential preservation of trabecular meshwork function in glaucoma. Its clinical history in other oxidative stress–driven diseases provides a strong foundation for repurposing, although the lack of direct ocular studies remains a challenge that would need to be addressed through targeted preclinical experiments and optimized drug delivery strategies. Overall, provided these hurdles are overcome through further research and development, Bardoxolone methyl could represent an innovative and promising therapeutic candidate for mitigating the oxidative and fibrotic aspects of glaucoma pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Nakagami, 2016; Wang et al., 2020).

Halofuginone.,"Proposal for Halofuginone.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Halofuginone is a synthetically modified analog of febrifugine, an alkaloid originally isolated from the Chinese herb Dichroa febrifuga. Its development began with the observation that febrifugine, which has historical applications in traditional Chinese medicine for treating malarial fever, exhibited potent biological activity. However, due to its unfavorable toxicity profile, researchers synthesized halofuginone—a halogenated derivative designed to maintain the bioactivity of febrifugine while reducing its toxicity. Chemically, it is defined as 7-bromo-6-chloro-3-[3-(3-hydroxy-2-piperidinyl)-2-oxopropyl]-4(3H)-quinazolinone, placing it within the quinazolinone class of compounds. This class is characterized by its heterocyclic ring structure that can be modified to yield a variety of biological activities, including antifibrotic and antiparasitic effects. Halofuginone was initially developed for veterinary applications; for instance, it has been used as a feed additive to prevent coccidiosis in poultry and to combat protozoan infections in cattle. Its advancements into human therapeutic realms have focused on its antifibrotic properties, where it specifically targets collagen synthesis mechanisms. This historical progression—from traditional herbal extract to a modern synthetic derivative with a defined mechanism of action—illustrates how halofuginone represents a strategic repurposing candidate for fibrotic disorders, and by extension, diseases like glaucoma where fibrosis plays a critical role in pathology (Pines et al., 2003; Pines et al., 2000).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of halofuginone is well documented across multiple species and disease models. In veterinary medicine, halofuginone has a long-standing record as an anticoccidial agent, particularly in the poultry industry where its use is aimed at mitigating protozoal infections. In these contexts, its safety and tolerability have been well established because doses effective for anticoccidial purposes are delivered systemically at concentrations that do not compromise animal health (Pines et al., 2000). Transitioning into mammalian systems, halofuginone’s inherent antifibrotic action was noted serendipitously during studies where a side effect of its use was skin thinning in animals. This clinical observation led to focused investigations into its ability to inhibit type I collagen synthesis—a hallmark of fibrotic disease processes. Multiple preclinical studies in rodent models demonstrated that halofuginone could significantly reduce fibrosis in conditions including dermal sclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, and even graft-versus-host disease. For instance, both in Tight-Skin (TSK) mouse models of scleroderma and in experimentally induced fibrosis in various tissues, halofuginone reduced collagen deposition and normalized extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, thereby restoring tissue architecture (Huebner, 2007; McGaha et al., 2002a). Further, early clinical studies in human subjects with scleroderma or chronic graft-versus-host disease have shown that topical formulations of halofuginone are well tolerated, with improvements in skin scores and reduced collagen mRNA levels. Despite its extensive use in fibrotic models and several clinical explorations in systemic and connective tissue diseases, there is no direct evidence in the literature that halofuginone or compounds from its chemical class have been applied to glaucoma or ocular fibrosis. Searches across clinical trial registries for halofuginone in the context of glaucoma or ocular fibrosis have yielded no results (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This absence of previous ocular application underscores that while halofuginone has been extensively evaluated in non-ocular fibrotic conditions, its potential in eye diseases such as glaucoma remains an unexplored yet mechanistically plausible domain (Pines et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
Halofuginone’s mechanism of action is multi-faceted and centrally involves its inhibition of collagen type I synthesis. At the molecular level, its antifibrotic effects appear to stem largely from modulation of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling cascade—a pathway that is critically implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. Specifically, halofuginone inhibits the TGF-β-mediated phosphorylation of Smad3, a key intracellular signal transducer necessary for the transcriptional activation of collagen type I genes. Inhibition of Smad3 phosphorylation prevents the Smad complex formation that would typically translocate to the nucleus to stimulate transcription of extracellular matrix proteins, notably collagen α1(I) (McGaha et al., 2002a; Pines et al., 2003). Additionally, halofuginone has been shown to require new protein synthesis in order to exert its inhibitory effects on collagen transcription; this suggests that its mechanism might include the upregulation of inhibitory proteins or factors that destabilize collagen mRNA (Pines et al., 2003).

A particularly intriguing aspect of halofuginone’s action is its binding to and inhibition of prolyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the incorporation of proline into nascent collagen peptides. Collagen molecules, especially type I collagen, are highly proline-rich, and inhibition of prolyl-tRNA synthetase disrupts the translation process specific to collagen synthesis. This targeted interference means that halofuginone can selectively reduce the production of collagen without broadly affecting the synthesis of other proteins—a level of specificity that could prove especially beneficial in tissues where pathological fibrosis is driven by selective overproduction of collagen type I (Duan et al., 2020; McGaha et al., 2002a).

The compound also modulates other interconnected pathways, including the upregulation of inhibitory Smads such as Smad7, which further reinforces the suppression of TGF-β signaling. Secondary signaling cascades, including those mediated via PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, and NF-κB pathways, have been implicated in halofuginone’s overall antifibrotic profile, though its primary and most potent effect remains its specific inhibition of collagen type I gene expression. These molecular interactions collectively disrupt the cascade of events that generally lead to fibroblast activation, myofibroblast differentiation, and extracellular matrix deposition—all processes that are central to the pathophysiology of glaucoma, particularly in the trabecular meshwork where increased ECM deposition leads to elevated intraocular pressure (Huebner, 2007; McGaha et al., 2002b).

Expected Effect in Trabecular Meshwork Fibroblast Assays:
In the context of glaucoma, the key hypothesis being tested is that halofuginone will inhibit prolyl-tRNA synthetase activity in trabecular meshwork fibroblasts, thereby reducing collagen type I synthesis and TGF-β–driven fibrotic gene expression. Trabecular meshwork fibroblasts are known to contribute to extracellular matrix homeostasis and, when dysregulated, can lead to increased deposition of collagen and other ECM proteins. This excessive deposition is a major factor in reduced aqueous humor outflow and increased intraocular pressure characteristic of glaucoma. Based on previous studies, halofuginone is expected to act on these fibroblasts by downregulating the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway, reducing collagen α1(I) mRNA levels, and consequently diminishing protein translation of collagen type I (McGaha et al., 2002a; Luo et al., 2017). Moreover, by inhibiting prolyl-tRNA synthetase, halofuginone may also impair the post-translational processing of collagen molecules, further curtailing collagen accumulation (McGaha et al., 2002a; Luo et al., 2017).

In fibroblast assays, one would expect to observe a dose-dependent decrease in collagen gene expression and protein deposition. Biochemical assays such as quantitative PCR for collagen mRNA, western blotting for type I collagen protein, and ECM staining techniques would likely demonstrate reduced ECM deposition when trabecular meshwork cells are treated with halofuginone. Additionally, functional assays to measure contractility, such as collagen gel contraction assays, should show that treated fibroblasts exhibit reduced contractile behavior, consistent with a decrease in myofibroblast differentiation. Since TGF-β signaling is a driver of both fibrotic gene expression and cellular contractility, halofuginone’s inhibition of Smad3 phosphorylation should dampen these responses, leading to improvements in the biomechanical properties of the trabecular meshwork (Pines et al., 2003; McGaha et al., 2002a).

The expression of prolyl-tRNA synthetase in trabecular meshwork fibroblasts, while not directly detailed in the provided excerpts, can be reasonably inferred to be ubiquitous given its fundamental role in protein translation in most cell types. Therefore, its inhibition by halofuginone in these cells would be expected to selectively reduce the levels of collagen, which is particularly reliant on high proline content. Overall, the compound is thereby predicted to achieve a reduction in ECM deposition and contractility in trabecular meshwork fibroblasts, potentially normalizing aqueous humor outflow and lowering intraocular pressure in glaucoma models (Duan et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
Halofuginone represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for glaucoma based on its multifaceted antifibrotic profile and well-characterized mechanism of action. Among its strengths is its high specificity for collagen type I synthesis inhibition through a dual mechanism of suppressing TGF-β/Smad3 signaling and inhibiting prolyl-tRNA synthetase. This dual action is particularly appealing in the context of glaucoma, where pathological collagen deposition in the trabecular meshwork is a contributing factor to increased intraocular pressure. The preclinical literature bolsters this rationale by consistently demonstrating reduced fibrosis in several organ systems, including skin, liver, and pulmonary tissues, without significant toxicity or interference with overall protein synthesis. In addition, halofuginone’s documented safety profile in both veterinary applications and limited human clinical studies suggests that it may have a favorable side effect profile when used topically or systemically for ocular applications (Pines et al., 2000; Huebner, 2007).

However, some weaknesses and uncertainties remain. Although halofuginone’s antifibrotic and anti-ECM deposition effects have been well established in extraocular tissues, there is a notable lack of direct evidence from glaucoma models or ocular tissues. Clinical trial searches have not revealed any studies specifically evaluating halofuginone for glaucoma or ocular fibrosis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This gap presents a significant translational challenge, as the ocular environment—including aspects such as drug penetrance, local pharmacokinetics, and potential off-target effects—may differ markedly from systemic models. Furthermore, the precise formulation and route of administration needed to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the trabecular meshwork without inducing ocular toxicity remain to be determined. Topical application, intravitreal injections, or other localized delivery methods will require careful optimization in preclinical models.

Another area of potential concern is the necessity of new protein synthesis for halofuginone’s inhibitory action. This requirement suggests that its antifibrotic effects might be indirectly mediated via the upregulation of inhibitory proteins rather than a direct, immediate blockade of collagen synthesis. While this mechanism adds a layer of specificity, it could also introduce variability in response depending on the cellular milieu and the state of protein synthesis in diseased trabecular meshwork fibroblasts (McGaha et al., 2002a; Duan et al., 2020).

From a strategic standpoint, halofuginone’s robust preclinical record and its detailed molecular mechanism establish a strong foundation for further investigation into its use for glaucoma. Yet, extensive preclinical validation in ocular models is required. Initially, in vitro studies on cultured trabecular meshwork fibroblasts should confirm that halofuginone effectively reduces collagen type I gene expression, protein synthesis, and cellular contractility without compromising cell viability. Subsequent in vivo studies in animal models of glaucoma must evaluate whether these molecular effects translate into improved aqueous humor outflow and reduced intraocular pressure. Additionally, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies specifically tailored to ocular tissues will be crucial to ascertain the proper dosing and delivery method that maximize efficacy while minimizing potential adverse effects.

In conclusion, halofuginone is a compelling candidate for repurposing in the treatment of glaucoma. Its ability to specifically target fibrotic processes at a transcriptional level, combined with its inhibition of prolyl-tRNA synthetase thereby reducing the translation of proline-rich collagen, aligns well with the therapeutic objective of reducing pathological extracellular matrix deposition in the trabecular meshwork. The hypothesis that halofuginone can modulate TGF-β–driven fibrotic responses in ocular fibroblasts is strongly supported by its established mechanisms in other fibrotic diseases. However, the translation to an ocular application mandates rigorous preclinical investigation given the current absence of direct clinical data in glaucoma models. The strengths of halofuginone include its mechanistic specificity, favorable safety profile in systemic and topical applications, and extensive supporting evidence from extraocular fibrotic studies. Its limitations, however, are rooted in the need for direct ocular efficacy data, optimization of local drug delivery, and confirmation of its effects in the unique microenvironment of the trabecular meshwork.

Overall, based on the available biochemical, clinical, and preclinical data, halofuginone shows significant promise as an antifibrotic agent with the potential to address the ECM dysregulation observed in glaucomatous pathology. The next steps should involve targeted in vitro and in vivo studies in ocular models to validate its efficacy and safety in the trabecular meshwork. If these studies replicate the antifibrotic and anti-contractile effects observed in other tissues, halofuginone could become a valuable therapeutic candidate in the armamentarium against glaucoma, providing a novel mechanism to control intraocular pressure through selective suppression of collagen synthesis (Pines et al., 2003; McGaha et al., 2002b; Luo et al., 2017).
