Proposal for Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Disulfiram is a synthetic small‐molecule drug originally discovered more than seventy years ago and is well known for its unique chemical structure featuring a tetraethylthiuram disulfide core. It is typically synthesized via the oxidation of diethyldithiocarbamate salts derived from the reaction of carbon disulfide with diethylamine, producing a compound with a central disulfide bond that confers its thiol‐reactive properties (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13). Chemically, disulfiram belongs to the dithiocarbamate family and is classified pharmacologically as an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor. Historically, this inhibition of ALDH has been the molecular basis for its clinical application as an alcohol aversion agent, where disulfiram induces the accumulation of acetaldehyde following alcohol ingestion, causing an assortment of discomforting physiological effects such as flushing, nausea, and tachycardia (Lu et al., 2021, p. 12). More recently, however, disulfiram has assumed a new identity in drug repurposing initiatives; its ability to interact covalently with cysteine residues in target proteins – a consequence of its thiuram disulfide structure – has attracted considerable attention in the context of inflammatory diseases. In particular, its capacity to interfere with the function of gasdermin D (GSDMD) via covalent modification is emerging as a promising mechanism by which disulfiram could counteract pathological inflammatory pathways (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4). This newly recognized activity places disulfiram within a therapeutic class of established drugs that are being re‐evaluated beyond their original indications, seeking to exploit their long clinical history and known safety profiles for novel applications such as the modulation of pyroptosis in inflammatory pathologies like chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Therapeutic History:
Disulfiram has a long-established history, primarily being used in the management of chronic alcohol use disorder since its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the early 1950s. As a stand‐alone therapy, its effectiveness in producing a pronounced aversive reaction to ethanol intake has made it a mainstay in addiction medicine. Over the decades, disulfiram has been administered safely to vast numbers of patients – a fact that is of critical importance when considering repurposing efforts, as its pharmacokinetics, dosing parameters, and toxicity profiles are well documented (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3). In addition to its established role in alcohol abstinence, disulfiram has been repurposed for a number of other applications. Emerging investigations have highlighted its promising activity in malignancies, where disulfiram, often in conjunction with supplemental copper, has demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against cancer stem cells via mechanisms that involve proteasome inhibition and modulation of redox homeostasis (Lu et al., 2021, pp. 13–14; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). More recently, its anti-inflammatory potential has been explored in the context of infectious diseases and systemic inflammatory responses. For instance, disulfiram has been evaluated in sepsis models, where its inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis led to reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines and improved survival in animal models (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). In models of ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), disulfiram pretreatment was shown to ameliorate renal dysfunction and histological damage by suppressing the noncanonical caspase-11–GSDMD inflammatory axis (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6). Although direct clinical studies of disulfiram in chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis remain limited, the encouraging preclinical signals from acute kidney insults and its capacity to modulate cell death pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation suggest that disulfiram—and its metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate—might be effective in attenuating the injurious inflammatory cascades observed in CKD.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, the repurposing hypothesis for disulfiram in chronic kidney disease centers on its recently identified inhibitory effect on gasdermin D (GSDMD), a pore-forming effector protein that is indispensable for the execution of pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory, lytic form of programmed cell death triggered by the activation of inflammasomes. When these multiprotein complexes form in response to pathogenic stimuli or sterile injury, they lead to the activation of inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1, and in noncanonical pathways, caspase-4/5/11. These enzymes cleave GSDMD to generate an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) that oligomerizes and inserts into the plasma membrane to form pores, thereby releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) into the extracellular milieu (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17). Disulfiram has been shown to block this crucial terminal step in pyroptosis by covalently modifying a conserved cysteine residue (Cys191 in human GSDMD and Cys192 in murine GSDMD) through a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. This chemical modification prevents the oligomerization and subsequent membrane pore formation by GSDMD, thereby directly inhibiting the execution phase of pyroptosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). Moreover, disulfiram’s activity is potentiated in the presence of copper ions, which may stabilize its reactive metabolites such as diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC), enhancing its inhibitory potency in cellular assays (Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18). The outcome of this inhibition is a significant reduction in the pyroptotic cell death cascade, as evidenced by decreased IL-1β release and overall attenuation of inflammatory signaling. In the context of the kidney, specifically within tubular epithelial cells (TECs), the inflammatory microenvironment driven by inflammasome activation is one of the critical factors in the progression from acute injury to chronic fibrosis. TECs are known to express inflammasome components and are susceptible to pyroptosis, which contributes to interstitial inflammation and fibrogenesis (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Therefore, by inhibiting the cleavage and activation of GSDMD in these cells, disulfiram has the potential to preserve tubular integrity and prevent the inflammatory cascade that ultimately drives chronic kidney injury.

Expected Effect:
Based on the proposed hypothesis and data from related inflammatory and renal injury models, disulfiram is predicted to exert a protective effect in the setting of chronic kidney disease by targeting the final common pathway of pyroptotic cell death. In a typical in vitro assay using primary tubular epithelial cells or established TEC lines, treatment with disulfiram at concentrations within the non-cytotoxic range (e.g., 0.1–5 µM as indicated in hypoxia/reoxygenation models) is expected to prevent the formation of GSDMD pores, thereby reducing cell membrane disruption, limiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18), and preserving cell viability (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11). The expected molecular signature following disulfiram treatment would include decreased levels of cleaved (active) GSDMD, reduced caspase-11 activation along with lower concentrations of circulating cytokines, as well as preserved markers of epithelial cell integrity. Given that GSDMD and components of the inflammasome are expressed in tubular epithelial cells (as supported by studies focusing on renal inflammatory pathways; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 7–9; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 9–10), the inhibition of GSDMD pore formation directly addresses a mechanistic driver of tubular injury. This would translate into reduced interstitial inflammation and limited myofibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition, which are critical steps in the fibrotic process that underpins CKD progression (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Ultimately, the expectation is that a therapeutic regimen involving disulfiram may slow or even halt the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease by mitigating the damaging effects of pyroptosis.

Overall Evaluation:
Disulfiram presents several attractive features as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. The strengths of disulfiram include:
1. A well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profile, supported by decades of clinical use in alcohol aversion therapy, which facilitates rapid translation into new clinical contexts (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Lu et al., 2021, p. 12).
2. A clear and innovative mechanism of action based on the inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis. This mechanism is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of CKD, where inflammasome activation and resultant pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells contribute to interstitial inflammation and fibrosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11).
3. The potential for its active metabolite, diethyldithiocarbamate, and the enhancing role of copper complexation to improve its potency as a pyroptosis inhibitor further bolster the therapeutic rationale (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18; Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34).
4. Preclinical evidence in models of acute kidney injury (ischemia-reperfusion injury) demonstrates that disulfiram can ameliorate renal dysfunction through inhibition of the caspase-11–GSDMD axis, suggesting that similar effects may be achieved in chronic inflammatory settings underlying CKD (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11).

However, there are also potential weaknesses and gaps that warrant further exploration:
1. Despite promising preclinical data in acute injury models and other inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, direct evidence of disulfiram’s efficacy in chronic kidney disease models remains limited. The available studies do not present long-term data specific to CKD or renal fibrosis, which is critical for validating its use in a chronic condition (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6).
2. While the mechanism of covalent modification of GSDMD at Cys191 is well supported by molecular studies, the extrapolation of these findings to tubular epithelial cells in the kidney (as opposed to macrophages or other inflammatory cells) requires additional confirmation. It is essential to verify that TECs exhibit similar susceptibility to the gasdermin D inhibitory effects of disulfiram under pathological conditions (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).
3. Dosage optimization, chronic toxicity assessments, and potential off-target effects in the renal context have not yet been extensively characterized. Although the historical human use of disulfiram supports a favorable safety profile, the dosing regimen for CKD might differ from that used for alcohol aversion therapy, given the distinct pharmacodynamics required to inhibit pyroptosis in kidney tissues (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8).
4. Another consideration is the effect of systemic modulation of pyroptosis. Since pyroptosis is integral to effective immune responses under certain circumstances, indiscriminate long-term inhibition could potentially compromise host defenses against infections. This balance between therapeutic efficacy in CKD and preservation of necessary immune functions must be carefully evaluated in preclinical models and eventually in clinical trials (Hu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).

In summary, disulfiram emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease due to its novel mechanism of targeting gasdermin D-induced pyroptosis—a pathway that is increasingly recognized as a critical driver of renal inflammation and fibrogenesis. Its long clinical history, established oral bioavailability, and well-characterized safety profile offer substantial advantages that could accelerate its translation into CKD-focused studies. The evidence from acute kidney injury models and inflammatory disease research forms a strong mechanistic rationale for its use to preserve tubular epithelial integrity and mitigate interstitial inflammation. Nevertheless, further detailed studies are imperative to validate its effectiveness in chronic kidney models, delineate optimal dosing strategies, and ensure that the inhibition of pyroptosis does not adversely affect normal immune surveillance. Based on the data reviewed—from biochemical studies demonstrating covalent modification of GSDMD (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8) to preclinical studies in renal injury models (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6)—the overall evaluation supports continued investigation of disulfiram as a repurposed agent in CKD. Its potential to modulate a critical pathogenic pathway in chronic kidney injury could represent a novel therapeutic intervention that merits further preclinical and clinical development (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18).
