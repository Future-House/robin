Proposal for Brilliant Blue G (BBG; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #B0770)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Brilliant Blue G (BBG) is a synthetic dye originally developed for use in food and as a surgical visualizing agent that has been repurposed as a pharmacological agent. BBG is part of the broad class of blue dyes that have been extensively studied for their ability to interact with the purinergic receptor family, most notably acting as a non‐competitive antagonist of the P2X7 receptor. The compound’s chemical structure confers high water solubility and the ability to be administered at defined doses with a favorable safety profile, as demonstrated by its routine use in ophthalmic surgery and CNS studies without systemic toxicity. In its role as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, BBG has been used in various preclinical studies investigating inflammatory and cell death pathways. Its synthetic origin and established manufacturing process, as offered by suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #B0770), support its scalability for repurposing in chronic diseases. BBG belongs to a class of small molecules that modulate ion channel function, particularly by binding to the ATP‐activated P2X7 receptor, which has been implicated in various inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. This class of compounds has been employed not only for their staining properties but also for their ability to interfere with cellular signaling events related to inflammation, rendering them of considerable interest in conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD) where inflammation and fibrosis are critical pathogenic factors (Ferreira et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Brilliant Blue G has been most widely recognized as a histological staining agent with established safety in both preclinical and clinical contexts, particularly within the neuroprotective field. Its pharmacological actions extend to antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, and preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in animal models of inflammatory diseases, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and various neurodegenerative conditions. More recently, BBG has been evaluated in rodent models of kidney disease. For example, in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) models—a widely used experimental model that mimics tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis—BBG treatment has been observed to reduce inflammation, diminish interstitial fibrosis, and promote tubular cell regeneration (Pereira et al., 2020). In rodent hypertensive nephropathy models, BBG has also been reported to modulate renal vascular resistance and alter tubular injury markers, suggesting that its renoprotective effects might extend to a broader spectrum of CKD–related pathologies. Although clinical trials directly targeting chronic kidney disease with BBG have not yet been detailed in the public literature, searches in ClinicalTrials.gov using terms related to “Brilliant Blue G OR P2X7 antagonist OR P2X7 inhibitor OR NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have identified several ongoing studies investigating similar P2X7 blockade strategies in CKD, which support the translational potential of this approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Prior investigations in animal models of lupus nephritis and hypertensive kidney disease have indicated that BBG’s anti‐inflammatory profile, including decreased IL-1β levels and reduced macrophage infiltration, is conducive to preventing progressive renal damage (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020). Veterinary and preclinical applications in models of inflammatory injury provide a solid foundation for repurposing BBG as a potential therapeutic candidate in conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, such as CKD.

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism by which BBG is hypothesized to exert its renoprotective effects in CKD is centered on its ability to non‐competitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor present on both renal immune and epithelial cells. The P2X7 receptor is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated cation channel that is activated under pathophysiological conditions where extracellular ATP levels are elevated, which frequently occurs during tissue injury and inflammation. Once activated, the P2X7 receptor facilitates the formation of pores in the plasma membrane that allow for the influx of cations and the efflux of cellular contents, thereby precipitating a cascade of intracellular events. One critical downstream consequence of P2X7 activation is the priming and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that, upon activation, recruits the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and pro-caspase-1. This assembly leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase-1, which in turn processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, resulting in their secretion and the amplification of the inflammatory response. Moreover, P2X7 activation can induce pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that further exacerbates tissue injury and inflammation (Arulkumaran, 2016).

BBG exerts its effects via a noncompetitive blockade of the P2X7 receptor. In doing so, BBG prevents ATP-induced ion channel opening, thereby blocking the subsequent calcium influx and pore formation that are necessary for downstream inflammasome priming. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that BBG inhibits P2X7 receptor-mediated responses, including the calcium influx and the release of IL-1β from macrophages and other immune cells. In vitro studies with BBG have revealed nanomolar potency in blocking P2X7-mediated activities, which is reflective of its efficacy in dampening the inflammasome-related cytokine cascades (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019). Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that BBG may also interfere with pannexin-1 channels that are thought to facilitate ATP release and further promote inflammasome activation, although the precise relationship between pannexin-1 and P2X7 remains the subject of active research (Ferreira et al., 2016). Consequently, by inhibiting the P2X7 receptor, BBG blocks the ATP-driven initiation of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade. This blockade limits caspase-1 activation and the subsequent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, ultimately reducing local inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrotic remodeling within the renal parenchyma. Evidence from animal models indicates that such inhibition leads to reduced macrophage infiltration, decreased fibrogenic markers, and enhanced tubular cell regeneration, which collectively preserve the integrity of the tubulointerstitial architecture (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).

Expected Effect:
Given the established mechanistic pathway, BBG is expected to exert multifaceted renoprotective effects when applied to models of chronic kidney disease. In the proposed assay evaluating drug effects on renal cells, the expected outcome would involve a significant reduction in ATP-induced inflammasome activation. Specifically, by antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, BBG should lower the levels of active caspase-1, thereby reducing the maturation and extracellular release of IL-1β. This attenuation of inflammasome activation is expected to diminish pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells and mitigate pro-inflammatory cytokine release from resident macrophages. BBG’s inhibition of these pathways would theoretically preserve tubular architecture and limit interstitial fibrosis—a hallmark of progressive CKD. The renoprotective effect is anticipated to be observed as decreased expression of fibrosis markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and heat shock protein-47 (HSP47), as well as reduced collagen deposition, as evidenced in rodent models of UUO and hypertensive nephropathy (Pereira et al., 2020).

At the molecular level, renal epithelial cells, particularly proximal tubular cells, express both P2X7 receptors and components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Immunohistochemical studies in animal models have demonstrated that under pathological conditions, P2X7 receptor expression is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells and can lead to enhanced production of IL-1β when activated by extracellular ATP (Arulkumaran, 2016; Howarth, 2020). Therefore, BBG is expected to be especially effective in cell types that are critical in the development of inflammation and fibrosis in CKD. By reducing the number of inflammatory cells (such as CD68-positive macrophages) infiltrating the renal parenchyma and by limiting cell death via pyroptosis, BBG may also indirectly reduce the fibrotic signaling that is mediated by cytokines such as TGF-β. This dual effect—both direct inhibition of inflammatory signaling and preservation of renal cell integrity—provides a compelling rationale for BBG’s use in preventing the progression of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020).

Moreover, BBG’s known safety profile in central nervous system studies and its extensive use as a surgical dye underscore its translational potential. Its water solubility and known pharmacokinetics facilitate dosing strategies that could be adapted for chronic administration in CKD patients. Additionally, the indirect suppression of inflammasome activation through P2X7 antagonism presents a novel approach to modulating the inflammatory microenvironment in the kidney, one that targets a critical nexus of inflammation and fibrosis (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, BBG presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on its ability to noncompetitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor, thereby blocking ATP-induced inflammasome priming and activation. The strengths of BBG include its well-established safety profile, water solubility, and proven efficacy in various rodent models of kidney injury such as hypertensive nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction. Preclinical data indicate that BBG can reduce key mediators of inflammation such as IL-1β, lower caspase-1 activation, and mitigate the deleterious effects of pyroptosis on renal tubular architecture, all of which are central to the pathophysiology of CKD (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).

However, several challenges remain that warrant further investigation. There is limited direct clinical data specifically evaluating BBG in human CKD patients, although the identification of related clinical trials targeting P2X7 and NLRP3 receptors in CKD suggests active interest in this therapeutic approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while BBG’s mechanism of action is well supported by in vitro and animal studies, the potential for differential effects based on receptor splice variants and cell type specificity in renal tissue must be carefully delineated. For instance, recent studies indicate that variations in P2X7 receptor expression and function in the renal vasculature may impact not only inflammatory signaling but also vascular tone, which could influence overall renal perfusion and function (Howarth, 2020).

Moreover, while BBG’s indirect inhibition of the inflammasome pathway via P2X7 antagonism is mechanistically attractive, redundancy in inflammasome activation pathways—such as those that are P2X7-independent—might limit the overall efficacy of BBG as a monotherapy. Some studies have demonstrated that even with effective P2X7 inhibition, alternative pathways may still sustain IL-1β release under inflammatory conditions (Arulkumaran, 2016; Prendecki et al., 2022). Therefore, combination therapies that target multiple nodes in the inflammasome network may ultimately be required to achieve robust clinical benefit.

In terms of drug development strategies, BBG benefits from its established manufacturing and dosing data, which accelerates early phase clinical trial design and regulatory considerations. In addition, BBG has been successfully used in non-renal contexts—including long-term treatments in models of graft-versus-host disease—without significant toxicity, lending further support to its translational potential (Geraghty et al., 2019). The extensive literature on BBG’s anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in preclinical models provides a solid rationale for advancing this candidate for CKD even as further mechanistic and pharmacodynamic studies are conducted.

Weaknesses of this candidate include the fact that while much of the preclinical data is encouraging, there is still a need for robust clinical trials that specifically assess BBG in CKD. Additionally, given the complexity of CKD pathogenesis—which involves multiple overlapping inflammatory and fibrotic signaling mechanisms—it will be important to determine whether BBG alone can induce sufficient therapeutic benefit or whether it is best applied as part of a combination regimen. Moreover, the potential vascular effects of P2X7 antagonism require further clarification to ensure that systemic hemodynamics are not adversely affected, particularly in patients with existing cardiovascular complications that often accompany CKD (Howarth, 2020).

Overall, the mechanistic rationale for BBG centers on its ability to interfere with a critical inflammatory pathway—namely, the ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. This blockade not only reduces the activation of caspase-1 and the release of IL-1β but also limits pyroptotic cell death, preservation of tubular architecture, and ultimately, fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. These effects address key pathogenic mechanisms underlying CKD progression. Moreover, aspects such as its water solubility, known dosing regimens from CNS and surgical applications, and favorable preclinical safety record render BBG an attractive candidate for fast-tracked repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Ferreira et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2020).

In conclusion, the evidence reviewed indicates that Brilliant Blue G holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. Its mechanism—centered on noncompetitive antagonism of the P2X7 receptor and consequent suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade—offers a novel approach to preserving renal function by reducing inflammatory injury and fibrosis. While further research, particularly targeted clinical trials in the CKD patient population, is necessary to fully validate its efficacy and safety in this context, the preclinical data and extensive understanding of its molecular interactions support the continued development of BBG for CKD therapy (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).
