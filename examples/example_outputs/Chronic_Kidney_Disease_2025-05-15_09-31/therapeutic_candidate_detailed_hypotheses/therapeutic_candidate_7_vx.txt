Proposal for VX-765 (Belnacasan; InvivoGen, catalog #tlrl-vg765)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
VX-765 (Belnacasan) is an orally bioavailable small‐molecule prodrug that is metabolized in vivo to yield the active metabolite VRT-043198, a selective irreversible inhibitor of inflammatory caspase‐1. It belongs to the class of caspase-1 inhibitors, which are designed to target the proteolytic enzyme caspase‐1 responsible for the post-translational processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Originally discovered through efforts to identify small molecules that could modulate inflammasome-mediated inflammation, VX-765 was synthesized to covalently interact with the catalytic cysteine residue of caspase‐1 and thereby block its activity. This group of compounds is part of a broader category of anti-inflammatory agents that have been applied in conditions where excessive inflammasome activation leads to tissue damage, and they have been used in clinical studies for disorders such as epilepsy and psoriasis, demonstrating that this drug class can effectively modulate immune signaling pathways and cytokine maturation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).

Therapeutic History:
VX-765 has an established history in preclinical and early clinical research. It has advanced into Phase II trials in both epilepsy and psoriasis, conditions associated with chronic inflammation and abnormal cytokine signaling, thereby establishing a safety profile and demonstrating adequate target engagement in humans. Although it has not been widely evaluated in clinical trials specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), preclinical studies conducted in rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) have demonstrated that VX-765 effectively reduces markers of inflammation such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), diminishes macrophage infiltration, and reduces collagen deposition, which are indicative of reduced fibrotic remodeling in the kidney (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024). Additionally, the general class of caspase-1 inhibitors has been successfully applied in various inflammatory conditions, and mechanistic studies suggest that inhibiting caspase-1 can interrupt the cascade leading to pyroptotic cell death—a key factor in inflammatory tissue damage. Although there is no large-scale clinical trial data in CKD to date, the compound’s mechanism, coupled with existing human safety data from other indications, strongly supports its rapid repurposing potential for kidney diseases (Sanz et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
VX-765’s mechanism of action is centered on the selective inhibition of caspase-1, an essential enzyme involved in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, and in mediating a form of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that VX-765 is a prodrug that is metabolized into VRT-043198, which binds irreversibly to the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys285) in the active site of caspase-1 through covalent interactions. Structural analyses, including crystallography experiments, have elucidated that VRT-043198 makes additional hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with key residues (e.g., R179, Q283, P343, and R383) ensuring a high degree of selectivity for inflammatory caspases over apoptotic caspases (Yang, 2019). By blocking caspase-1, VX-765 prevents the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active cytokine forms, thereby reducing the release of these potent inflammatory mediators; it also prevents the cleavage of gasdermin D, a critical effector protein required to form membrane pores that mediate pyroptotic cell death. In renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and other cell types implicated in kidney disease, such proclivity for pyroptosis can drive local inflammatory cascades and fibrotic signaling, so inhibiting caspase-1 may mitigate these processes (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). The specificity of VX-765 for caspase-1 has been confirmed through both in vitro assays—with assessments of IL-1β release and gasdermin D cleavage—and in vivo models where administration of VX-765 led to reduced serum IL-1β, improved survival in sepsis models, and attenuation of inflammatory tissue injury (Yang, 2019; Liu et al., 2023).

Expected Effect in Chronic Kidney Disease:
In the context of Chronic Kidney Disease, particularly conditions characterized by diabetic nephropathy and renal fibrosis, the hypothesis is that VX-765 will reduce caspase-1 mediated pyroptosis and subsequent inflammatory cytokine release in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). TEC pyroptosis contributes to tubular cell death and triggers a deleterious inflammatory milieu that ultimately drives fibrotic remodeling through the activation of myofibroblasts and increased deposition of extracellular matrix components such as collagen. VX-765 is expected to block this cascade at an early step by preventing the activation of caspase-1, thereby limiting IL-1β and IL-18 maturation and secretion. This, in turn, should reduce the recruitment and activation of inflammatory macrophages—a process that has been shown to contribute to fibrogenesis in the kidney (Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Preclinical evidence from rodent models supports that administration of VX-765 leads to decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced expression of pro-fibrotic markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and a lower deposition of collagen, thereby preserving renal tubular structure and function. Considering caspase-1 and the inflammasome complex are expressed in renal cells including TECs and resident macrophages, targeting caspase-1 is a rational approach to interrupt the feedback loop between cell death and inflammation that exacerbates CKD progression (Zhou & Li, 2023; Sanz et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of VX-765 as a therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease include its well-defined mechanism of action, oral bioavailability, and the fact that it has already undergone Phase II clinical trials in other indications, demonstrating an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in humans. The mechanistic rationale is strong: by targeting caspase-1, VX-765 interrupts the inflammasome-driven cascade responsible for both pyroptotic cell death and the maturation of key pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in renal fibrosis. Preclinical models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction have provided promising evidence that caspase-1 inhibition can reduce renal inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and extracellular matrix deposition, suggesting that VX-765 might slow the progression of fibrotic changes in CKD (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). Furthermore, targeting a central mediator such as caspase-1 may have broader benefits by influencing several downstream inflammatory pathways simultaneously, thus potentially overcoming the limitations of therapies that target individual cytokines.
Weaknesses include the translational gap that currently exists between preclinical efficacy in rodent models and clinical benefit in human CKD patients. Although VX-765 has demonstrated safety in epilepsy and psoriasis trials, the long-term effects of inhibiting caspase-1 in a chronic disease setting like CKD are not fully understood, particularly given the complex roles that inflammasome signaling may play in tissue repair, host defense, and kidney homeostasis. There is also the possibility that fully inhibiting caspase-1 could lead to compensatory activation of alternative inflammatory pathways or unintended off-target effects, especially in patients with compromised kidney function. Additionally, while preclinical data are encouraging, there is a need for dedicated clinical trials in CKD and related fibrotic conditions to establish the optimal dosing, efficacy, and safety profile in this specific patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).
Overall, VX-765 exhibits several promising attributes as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for CKD: its defined molecular target, demonstrated anti-inflammatory mechanism through caspase-1 inhibition, and supportive preclinical evidence of renoprotection provide a compelling rationale for further investigation. The strengths of existing human safety data and oral administration combine with a robust mechanistic framework to justify advancing VX-765 into clinical trials in patients with CKD. Nonetheless, further research is required to clarify long-term effects on renal function, potential compensatory inflammatory mechanisms, and the detailed pharmacodynamics in the setting of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. With carefully designed clinical studies focusing on renal endpoints, VX-765 could represent a valuable addition to the therapeutic arsenal against CKD, particularly for patients whose disease is driven significantly by inflammasome-mediated inflammation and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Zhou & Li, 2023).
