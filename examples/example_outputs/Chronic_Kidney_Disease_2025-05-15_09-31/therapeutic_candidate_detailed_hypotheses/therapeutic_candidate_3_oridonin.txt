Proposal for Oridonin (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #O2015)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Oridonin is a naturally occurring diterpenoid compound isolated primarily from Rabdosia rubescens, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb that has been used for centuries to treat inflammatory conditions and cancers. As a kaurane-type diterpenoid, its structure comprises four isoprene units arranged into a characteristic tetracyclic skeleton, which is emblematic of this class of natural products. The compound’s discovery and development emerged from the long-standing tradition of using Rabdosia rubescens (also known as Donglingcao) in Asian folk medicine, where it was historically applied for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In the broader context of drug development, diterpenoids such as oridonin have been recognized for their “drug-like” properties; they have provided scaffolds for synthetic modifications aimed at improving potency, solubility, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Moreover, the extraction and study of oridonin reflect an important paradigm in natural products research, wherein historical use is validated and expanded upon with modern medicinal chemistry techniques. This compound, commercially available from suppliers like Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #O2015), fits well within the class of small-molecule natural products that have been repurposed for modern therapeutic applications in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases (Ding et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Oridonin’s use spans a broad spectrum of therapeutic applications. Traditionally, the herbal preparations containing oridonin were employed in Chinese medicine to alleviate conditions ranging from pharyngitis and gingivitis to various inflammatory and tumorous conditions. With the advent of modern biochemical and pharmacological research, oridonin has been extensively studied for its anticancer efficacy; many preclinical studies have demonstrated its capacity to induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and suppress metastasis in a variety of cancer cell lines (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In addition to its anticancer properties, several studies have documented oridonin’s robust anti-inflammatory actions. Notably, oridonin has shown efficacy in experimental models of colitis and gout through its inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that mediates the maturation of IL-1β and is a critical driver of inflammatory responses (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020). Although most of the historical and ongoing research has emphasized oridonin’s anticancer and acute inflammatory indications, there is emerging interest in its potential role in renal pathologies. A search on ClinicalTrials.gov using terms such as “Oridonin AND kidney OR renal OR chronic kidney disease OR glomerulonephritis OR proteinuria OR glomerular” returned tens of thousands of trials, indicating significant research activity into natural products and potentially repurposed compounds for kidney diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, to date there is limited direct clinical evidence of oridonin being deployed specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preclinical studies, particularly those involving rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and ischemia–reperfusion injury, have demonstrated renoprotective effects such as reduced inflammatory cytokine levels, diminished fibrosis markers, and improved renal function parameters; these effects suggest that oridonin or its derivatives might be promising candidates for treating CKD or similar renal conditions (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, oridonin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects primarily through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex known to activate caspase-1 and mediate the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. Recent mechanistic studies have shown that oridonin covalently binds to cysteine 279 within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, a critical residue required for the ATPase activity of NLRP3 and its subsequent oligomerization (He et al., 2018). This binding effectively prevents the conformational changes necessary for the recruitment of NEK7, thereby halting inflammasome assembly and activation. In macrophages, this inhibition leads to a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and attenuates inflammatory cell recruitment—a mechanism that has been validated through pull‐down assays and mass spectrometry, which demonstrated nanomolar potency of oridonin in suppressing NLRP3 activation (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020).

Beyond its direct interaction with the NLRP3 inflammasome, oridonin has been shown to modulate additional signaling pathways. For example, it can inhibit NF-κB and p38-MAPK activation, further blunting the inflammatory response, and it has been implicated in the activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidative defenses at lower concentrations, contributing to its cytoprotective effects (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019). These multifaceted actions underscore the polypharmacological nature of oridonin: while its primary mode of action appears to involve covalent modification of NLRP3, its downstream effects extend into a broader anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative network. This convergence on inflammatory signaling pathways is particularly relevant because overactivation of the inflammasome and subsequent pyroptotic cell death are implicated not only in acute inflammatory diseases but also in chronic fibrotic processes within the kidney (Ding et al., 2020).

Expanding the context to renal pathology, the hypothesis driving our proposal is that human podocytes—which are essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier—express components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of NLRP3 in these cells has been linked to pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, which in turn contributes to podocyte loss, proteinuria, and interstitial fibrosis, all hallmarks of CKD. Although most direct evidence of oridonin’s NLRP3 inhibition comes from studies in immune cells like macrophages (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2016), the underlying mechanism is conserved across cell types. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that oridonin could similarly inhibit NLRP3 activation in podocytes, thereby preventing inflammasome assembly, blocking caspase-1 activation, and ultimately reducing the release of IL-1β (Li et al., 2021). By precluding these downstream events, oridonin may attenuate the cycle of inflammatory damage and fibrosis that underpins progressive renal injury in CKD (Li et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assays and eventual in vivo models of chronic kidney disease, the expected effect of oridonin centers on its ability to protect podocytes from NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated injury. More specifically, by covalently binding to cysteine 279 in NLRP3, oridonin is anticipated to inhibit ATP hydrolysis and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex. This mechanistic blockade should result in a reduction of caspase-1 activation—a key step in the maturation of IL-1β—and thereby diminish the secretion of this potent pro-inflammatory cytokine (He et al., 2018). In podocytes, such suppression is expected to reduce pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death that directly compromises the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and leads to proteinuria. Preservation of podocyte viability would, in turn, help maintain glomerular barrier integrity, minimizing the leakage of plasma proteins into the urine and limiting the ensuing fibrotic response in the renal interstitium (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).

Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB and p38-MAPK signaling pathways could provide additional benefits by reducing overall renal inflammation. In animal models of kidney injury—such as those induced by ischemia–reperfusion or diabetic nephropathy—treatment with compounds that inhibit these pathways has been correlated with improved renal function parameters (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021). Therefore, beyond its direct effect on podocyte inflammasome activity, oridonin may exert broader renoprotective actions by dampening inflammatory cascades that contribute to interstitial fibrosis and progressive renal insufficiency. In this context, oridonin’s oral bioavailability and established history in traditional medicine support the feasibility of translating these preclinical findings into clinical benefit for CKD patients (Su et al., 2024).

It is important to note that while direct evidence of oridonin’s effects on human podocytes remains to be fully elucidated, the expression of NLRP3 in podocytes has been demonstrated in experimental models of CKD. Additionally, studies involving natural products that inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome—such as fucoidan in diabetic kidney disease—have provided supportive mechanistic insights, suggesting that the targeting of inflammasome activation in podocytes is a viable therapeutic strategy (Wang et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, oridonin emerges as a compelling therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease, given its well-documented mechanism of inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome and its extensive background in modulating inflammatory pathways. Its natural origin and historical use in traditional Chinese medicine provide a robust basis for its safety profile, and preclinical studies have demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, including models of colitis, gout, and even acute kidney injury (Ding et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2021). Strengths of oridonin include its specificity for NLRP3 via covalent binding to a critical cysteine residue, which has been shown to yield nanomolar potency in relevant assays (He et al., 2018). Additionally, oridonin’s ability to modulate secondary pathways (NF-κB, p38-MAPK, and Nrf2) may amplify its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective benefits, addressing multiple facets of CKD pathophysiology ranging from podocyte loss to interstitial fibrosis (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).

However, several weaknesses must also be considered. Despite promising preclinical data in other disease models, direct evidence for oridonin’s efficacy in modulating NLRP3 activation specifically in podocytes remains limited. Most mechanistic studies have been conducted in macrophages or other cell types, and while the extrapolation is reasonable given the conserved nature of inflammasome signaling, dedicated studies using human podocytes are needed to substantiate the proposed protective effects on proteinuria and interstitial fibrosis (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Furthermore, issues such as moderate potency, limited solubility, and variable bioavailability have been noted with oridonin, necessitating further formulation and structural optimization to ensure therapeutic efficacy in a clinical setting (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). These pharmacokinetic considerations are particularly critical for a chronic indication like CKD, where long-term dosing and sustained target engagement are required.

Another consideration is the translation of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects observed in acute injury models or non-renal tissue into the context of chronic kidney disease, which involves complex and multifactorial pathophysiology. Although the suppression of inflammasome-driven pyroptosis is a promising target for preventing podocyte injury, CKD progression involves additional factors such as hemodynamic stress, metabolic derangements, and immune dysregulation that may not be fully addressed by NLRP3 inhibition alone (Huang et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2020). Consequently, while the mechanistic specificity of oridonin is appealing, its efficacy in a multifaceted chronic disease state like CKD requires rigorous preclinical validation followed by carefully designed clinical trials.

In summary, oridonin holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease based on its robust anti-inflammatory mechanism, particularly its ability to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome via covalent binding to cysteine 279. The compound’s multifaceted mechanism—encompassing inhibition of caspase-1 activation, IL-1β maturation, and subsequent pyroptosis—could translate into preservation of podocyte integrity, reduction in proteinuria, and attenuation of interstitial fibrosis, all of which are critical endpoints in CKD management (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Nonetheless, challenges related to drug solubility, bioavailability, and the direct demonstration of efficacy in podocytes must be addressed. Given its strong preclinical validation in other inflammatory conditions, further targeted studies focusing on its renal effects and optimization of drug-like properties are warranted before it can be advanced as a viable treatment for CKD (Tan et al., 2021; Su et al., 2024). Overall, while there is a clear mechanistic rationale supporting the therapeutic potential of oridonin in CKD, additional studies specifically assessing its effects in relevant renal cell types and chronic disease models will be critical to fully validate its clinical utility.
