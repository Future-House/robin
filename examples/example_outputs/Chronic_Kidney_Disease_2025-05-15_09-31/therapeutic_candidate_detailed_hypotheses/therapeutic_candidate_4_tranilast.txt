Proposal for Tranilast (MedChemExpress, catalog #HY-50819)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tranilast, commercially available from MedChemExpress (catalog #HY-50819), is a small-molecule synthetic compound originally developed as an anti-allergic agent. Chemically, it is an anthranilic acid derivative, specifically N-[3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl]-anthranilic acid, synthesized initially to treat allergic conditions such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and cutaneous disorders, including keloids and hypertrophic scars (Gilbert et al., 2012). The compound belongs to a class of agents that modulate inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways. The early synthesis of tranilast involved modifying the cinnamoyl anthranilate moiety to enhance potency against pro-fibrotic mediators like transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) while maintaining an acceptable toxicity profile. Over time, the compound’s anti-allergic properties were expanded by preclinical findings that demonstrated its potential to inhibit fibrotic changes via modulation of cytokine signaling and cellular proliferation pathways. This class of anthranilic acid derivatives has been used both in dermatologic and immunologic contexts, providing a background of clinical utility and safety that benefits the repurposing efforts for conditions such as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (Gilbert et al., 2012).

Therapeutic History:
Tranilast has a well-documented history in clinical settings as an anti-allergic drug since its introduction in Japan decades ago. Its traditional indications have included treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and prevention of keloid formation. More recently, emerging preclinical studies have evaluated tranilast for its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in multiple organ systems. Notably, in experimental animal models of renal disease, tranilast has been investigated in contexts such as diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In these models, tranilast demonstrated the ability to reduce proteinuria, improve kidney structural integrity, and diminish collagen deposition (Gilbert et al., 2012). For instance, in diabetic nephropathy studies, tranilast reduced albuminuria and slowed the decline in glomerular filtration rate through attenuation of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix accumulation. Additionally, human studies in early-stage CKD patients, particularly those with diabetic nephropathy, receiving tranilast combined with standard therapies such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs have shown reductions in urinary markers like collagen type IV and albumin excretion (Gilbert et al., 2012). Beyond renal applications, the compound’s repurposing has been explored in cardiovascular contexts and even in certain inflammatory conditions driven by aberrant inflammasome activation, suggesting a versatility that supports further investigation into its utility against CKD. However, review of ClinicalTrials.gov did not reveal any registered trials directly assessing tranilast in CKD or related renal fibrosis, indicating that while preclinical and limited clinical observations are encouraging, robust clinical evaluation in CKD remains to be undertaken (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
The hypothesized mechanism for tranilast in CKD centers on its ability to inhibit key inflammatory and fibrotic processes via direct intervention in inflammasome biology. Tranilast’s molecular target is the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex that plays a pivotal role in innate inflammatory responses. The assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires a coordinated interaction among NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and the serine/threonine kinase NEK7. Activation of this complex ultimately leads to the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form, which subsequently processes pro-IL-1β into IL-1β, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that drives pyroptosis and contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Specifically, tranilast is proposed to disrupt the critical interactions between NLRP3 and ASC as well as between NLRP3 and NEK7. This disruption is believed to occur via direct binding to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3, which is essential for its oligomerization and subsequent recruitment of ASC. By preventing ASC oligomerization, tranilast effectively halts the assembly of the inflammasome, thereby blocking caspase-1 activation and reducing IL-1β secretion (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).

In addition to inflammasome disruption, tranilast has been shown to attenuate TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling—another major contributor to kidney disease progression. TGF-β is well documented as a central mediator of extracellular matrix synthesis and fibroblast activation, and its overexpression in chronic kidney injury drives interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. Tranilast’s inhibition of TGF-β signaling includes the suppression of Smad2 phosphorylation and downstream fibrotic responses, leading to reductions in collagen deposition and interstitial matrix accumulation (Gilbert et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2019). Furthermore, tranilast’s capacity to inhibit PDGF signaling reduces mesangial cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in the renal glomerulus, providing an additional mechanistic avenue through which it exerts its renoprotective effects (Gilbert et al., 2012).

Expected Effect:
Given the proposed mechanism, the expected effect of tranilast in a CKD context is to attenuate tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis by mitigating both inflammatory and fibrotic signaling. In tubular epithelial cells (TECs), oxidative stress triggers activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in IL-1β secretion and pyroptotic cell death—a process that not only damages the epithelial barrier but also leads to further recruitment of inflammatory cells. By interfering with the NLRP3–ASC and NLRP3–NEK7 interactions, tranilast is anticipated to reduce caspase-1 activation. Consequently, a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis is expected, which would alleviate tubular inflammation under conditions of oxidative stress (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).

Furthermore, the reduction in IL-1β and subsequent dampening of the inflammatory cascade should also lead to a decrease in TGF-β release. TGF-β is critically involved in driving fibroblast activation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. Thus, by curtailing the initial inflammasome-mediated inflammatory trigger, tranilast indirectly reduces TGF-β levels, thereby preventing its downstream pro-fibrotic effects. This is particularly relevant in diabetic nephropathy and UUO models, where TGF-β-mediated fibrosis is a major determinant of disease progression (Chen et al., 2020; Gilbert et al., 2012).

In summary, the expected outcome in an in vitro or in vivo CKD assay would be a demonstrable decrease in markers of inflammation (such as IL-1β levels), reduced caspase-1 activity, diminished pyroptosis (as measured by LDH release or similar assays), and lowered expression of fibrotic markers including collagen, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Moreover, the preservation of tubular epithelial cell integrity and a consequent improvement in overall kidney function would provide functional support for tranilast’s therapeutic efficacy in CKD (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Tranilast represents a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease based on its dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. From a mechanistic standpoint, its ability to selectively disrupt the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting key protein–protein interactions (specifically between NLRP3, ASC, and NEK7) underpins its potential to reduce caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. This targeted mechanism is particularly attractive because it distinguishes tranilast from broader-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs that may have off-target effects. Moreover, by concurrently attenuating TGF-β signaling pathways, tranilast can reduce fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition—both critical contributors to the progression of CKD (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019).

A major strength of tranilast is its established clinical use as an anti-allergic agent over several decades, which provides a substantial record of safety and tolerability in humans. Its oral dosing regimen further facilitates rapid clinical repurposing for CKD. Preclinical studies in animal models of diabetic nephropathy and UUO have demonstrated measurable benefits, such as reduced proteinuria and improved renal histology, lending support to its potential efficacy in human CKD (Gilbert et al., 2012).

However, there are certain weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Despite promising preclinical data, there is a noted absence of registered clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with tranilast (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), which indicates that further clinical validation is required. Moreover, while tranilast’s inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is supported by various mechanistic studies, the precise molecular details—such as confirmation of binding to the LRR domain of NLRP3 and the exact nature of its impact on NEK7 interactions—require further elucidation through biochemical and structural studies (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). In addition, as with any repurposed drug, careful evaluation of potential off-target immunomodulatory effects is necessary. There have been reports of immune-mediated adverse events in other clinical indications, which, although not prominent, must be monitored during chronic administration in CKD patients (Strilchuk et al., 2019).

In conclusion, the body of preclinical literature strongly supports the hypothesis that tranilast can disrupt NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and attenuate subsequent inflammatory and fibrotic cascades in the kidney. Given its dual mechanism—inhibiting both inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion and TGF-β–mediated fibrosis—tranilast emerges as an attractive candidate for repurposing in CKD. Its established use in other indications and favorable oral bioavailability further underscore its potential for rapid clinical translation. Nonetheless, the lack of direct clinical trial evidence in renal disease and the need for further mechanistic clarification represent critical challenges that the research team must address in subsequent studies (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023). Overall, the strengths of mechanistic specificity and a well-established safety profile position tranilast as a promising drug candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease, warranting further investigation through comprehensive preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials.
