Proposal for INF4E (Tocris, catalog #5903)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
INF4E is a synthetic electrophilic small‐molecule inhibitor that was initially discovered through phenotypic screening in macrophage models testing for NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. It is an acrylate derivative belonging to a class of compounds that harness α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl (Michael acceptor) functionalities to achieve covalent, irreversible inhibition of target proteins. Its discovery emerged during screening campaigns that looked for submicromolar potency against NLRP3, with subsequent chemical optimization to balance reactivity and cytotoxicity. Specifically, INF4E (also referred to in some studies as compound 9) was identified for its ability to selectively inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation by binding covalently to the NACHT domain’s ATP‐binding site, thereby interfering with ATP hydrolysis required for the conformational changes that lead to inflammasome assembly (Cocco et al., 2017; Blevins et al., 2022). As a member of the acrylate derivatives class, similar compounds have been explored in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular disorders, where targeting NLRP3 has shown promise. Members of this chemical class have a well‐documented history of being used as selective covalent modifiers with potential in modulating inflammatory signaling cascades.

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of INF4E and its related chemical family primarily stems from preclinical studies where they have been shown to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in various models of inflammation. INF4E was originally validated in sepsis models, demonstrating efficacy in reducing systemic inflammation, and subsequent studies extended its utility to show anti‐pyroptotic effects in macrophage cell lines with submicromolar potency. Moreover, related acrylate derivatives have been explored in inflammatory bowel disease models, where modifications to reduce cytotoxicity led to the generation of analogues such as INF39. Although the preclinical literature for this class of inhibitors is robust in the context of sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, and even in models of ischemic injury in the heart, there is no direct literature evidence that INF4E has been specifically used for treating chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis. Searches in Clinical Trials databases for “NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have revealed only nascent clinical exploration of NLRP3 inhibitors in renal disease, with most candidates like MCC950 and OLT1177 being at early development stages (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023). Thus, while INF4E’s mechanism of NLRP3 inhibition is highly relevant to inflammatory processes, its therapeutic history in kidney disease remains limited to preclinical mechanistic rationale rather than established clinical or veterinary use in CKD.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, INF4E exerts its action by covalently binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, specifically targeting its ATP‐binding site. The NACHT domain is essential for NLRP3 oligomerization and subsequent inflammasome assembly. INF4E’s acrylate (Michael acceptor) moiety reacts with cysteine residues present in this domain, thereby irreversibly blocking ATP hydrolysis. The inhibition of ATP hydrolysis interferes directly with the required conformational changes that transform NLRP3 from an inactive to an active state capable of recruiting the adaptor protein ASC and procaspase‐1. Consequently, the subsequent cleavage of caspase‐1 is prevented, which in turn stops the maturation and release of key pro‐inflammatory cytokines, notably IL‐1β and IL‐18 (Mezzaroma et al., 2021; Cocco et al., 2017).
This covalent binding mechanism is particularly significant because it offers prolonged inhibitory effects owing to its irreversible nature. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, where hypoxia serves as a potent priming signal for inflammasome activation and contributes to chronic inflammation and fibrosis, inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E is hypothesized to prevent the cascade leading to caspase‐1 activation, thus mitigating caspase‐1–dependent pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death—and reducing the release of IL‐18 (Blevins et al., 2022; Komada & Muruve, 2019).
The biochemical interactions of INF4E align with the known structure–activity relationships of electrophilic acrylate derivatives, as these compounds are designed to target the ATPase activity of NLRP3. By interfering with this enzymatic function, INF4E halts the nucleation of the inflammasome complex, thereby curtailing downstream signaling that ultimately leads to pyroptosis and fibrogenesis. The short-lived yet potent irreversible binding is a hallmark of this class of inhibitors, which has been exploited in several preclinical studies to provide a potent blockade of inflammation (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
In the context of the proposed assay and the underlying pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease, INF4E is anticipated to exhibit a therapeutic effect by mitigating hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation in proximal tubular epithelial cells. Hypoxic conditions are known to prime and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in these cells, and this process is a major contributor to tubular cell injury, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenic signaling—all key drivers of CKD progression.
The expected outcome when applying INF4E would be a significant reduction in ATP hydrolysis that is crucial for NLRP3 activation, thereby preventing the subsequent assembly of the inflammasome complex. This inhibition should lead to a decrease in caspase‐1 activity, ultimately lowering the maturation and secretion of IL‐18 (and possibly IL‐1β). Reduced levels of IL‐18 would then limit the inflammatory and fibrogenic signaling cascades that promote the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis. In assays using hypoxic proximal tubular cells, one would therefore predict reduced markers of pyroptosis, improved cell viability, and a lower expression of fibrogenic proteins such as TGF-β and α-SMA.
There is also supportive evidence that NLRP3 is expressed in proximal tubular cells and that its activation is directly linked to inflammatory responses and fibrosis under hypoxic conditions (Ochoa et al., 2023; Komada & Muruve, 2019). The selective inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E should thus translate into improved cellular integrity and a mitigated progression of the inflammatory milieu that typifies CKD. This expected modulation of pyroptosis and fibrosis markers provides a clear biochemical rationale for using INF4E as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic therapeutic candidate in kidney disease models.

Overall Evaluation:
The analysis of INF4E as a repurposed drug candidate for chronic kidney disease presents both promising and challenging aspects. One major strength of INF4E lies in its clearly defined mechanism of action; by targeting the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and interfering with ATP hydrolysis, INF4E offers a direct method to abrogate inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. This is particularly relevant in CKD, where hypoxia-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in proximal tubular cells is a key pathological event leading to pyroptosis, inflammation, and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019).
Another strength is its proven submicromolar potency as demonstrated in phenotypic screens, along with a degree of oral bioavailability in rodent models that supports the feasibility of future in vivo investigations (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021). This potency, combined with its specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome, positions INF4E as a candidate with the potential to modulate inflammatory responses without broadly suppressing the entire immune system. Moreover, by specifically reducing IL-18 release, INF4E may offer advantages over broader anti-inflammatory approaches that risk impairing normal host defense mechanisms (Thomas et al., 2022).
A potential weakness, however, is the risk associated with irreversible covalent binding, which, while conferring prolonged effects, may also lead to off-target toxicity if the selectivity is not absolute. Some acrylate derivatives have been noted for cytotoxicity issues, and although chemical optimization—such as the development of related compounds like INF39—has been undertaken to alleviate these concerns, it remains a critical point for evaluation in renal cells that are already susceptible to injury under hypoxic conditions (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).
Furthermore, while the mechanistic rationale for targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in CKD is strong, the clinical translation of NLRP3 inhibitors has been slow. Currently, only limited clinical trial data are available for NLRP3 inhibitors in CKD, and the majority of evidence remains at the preclinical level (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023).
Another consideration is that chronic kidney disease is a multifactorial condition wherein inflammasome activation is just one of several pathogenic processes, including metabolic dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and oxidative stress. Therefore, while INF4E may effectively block one critical pathway—namely, hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation—it might need to be combined with therapies targeting other aspects of CKD pathogenesis to achieve a comprehensive therapeutic effect (Unknown Reference; Mulay, 2019).
Despite these challenges, INF4E’s selectivity for a mechanistically validated target, its oral availability, and its demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory models provide a strong rationale for further investigation. In assays designed to model hypoxic tubular injury, INF4E is expected to reduce pyroptosis and fibrogenic signaling, thereby slowing CKD progression. The drug’s success in other inflammatory contexts, such as sepsis models, lends additional weight to its potential, although caution must be exercised when extrapolating these data to the complex microenvironment of the kidney (Blevins et al., 2022; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).

Continued research should focus on dosing optimization, safety profiling in kidney-specific models, and investigation of combination strategies that target both inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in CKD (Komada & Muruve, 2019; Mulay, 2019; Pagliaro & Penna, 2023; Thomas et al., 2022).

Overall, INF4E represents a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for chronic kidney disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, which aligns well with an established pathogenic pathway in CKD—namely, hypoxia-driven NLRP3 inflammasome activation in proximal tubular cells. Its ability to block the ATPase activity of NLRP3, thereby preventing both caspase-1 activation and IL-18 release, underpins a novel strategy aimed at mitigating pyroptosis and subsequent fibrogenic signaling cascades. While challenges such as potential off-target cytotoxicity, the need for extensive in vivo validation in CKD models, and integration into a multifactorial therapeutic approach remain, the compelling preclinical data for related compounds and the rigorous mechanistic underpinnings provide a strong basis for advancing INF4E in further preclinical studies and eventual clinical trials. Continued research should include detailed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological evaluations in renal models, as well as assessments of its efficacy in reducing markers of inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrosis in hypoxic proximal tubular cells. Given the complexity of CKD, INF4E may ultimately be best suited for combination therapy alongside agents addressing complementary pathogenic mechanisms. Overall, the potential strengths of INF4E—rooted in its selective, irreversible inhibition of a well‐validated molecular target—are balanced by the need for careful evaluation of safety and clinical translatability in the setting of chronic kidney disease (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019; Thomas et al., 2022).
