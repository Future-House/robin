Assay Overview:
The proposed TEER barrier integrity assay involves culturing renal tubular epithelial cells—such as primary human RPTEC or established cell lines like MDCK—on porous substrates or within microfluidic platforms to model the epithelial monolayer of the proximal tubule. By applying a low amplitude alternating current via electrode systems (e.g., integrated into an OrganoPlate or microfluidic chip), the assay quantifies the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) across the epithelial barrier. This electrical measurement serves as an indicator of tight junction integrity and overall barrier function. In this context, the assay specifically targets TGF-β-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process critically implicated in the fibrotic remodeling characteristic of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Complementary endpoints may include high-content imaging for tight junction markers (such as ZO-1) and assessments of extracellular matrix deposition to further correlate TEER changes with fibrotic transformation (tasinato2024developmentofan pages 305-307, nicolas2021highthroughputtransepithelial pages 4-5).

Biomedical Evidence:
CKD progression is intimately tied to a decline in renal epithelial integrity and the onset of fibrosis, largely driven by fibrotic stimuli such as TGF-β. The loss of tight junction integrity as measured by decreased TEER is an early indicator of EMT, which subsequently leads to fibrotic deposition and scarring in the kidney. Clinically, this pathway is central because loss of epithelial barrier function not only impairs tubular reabsorption and transport but also facilitates inflammatory and fibrotic cascades that further deteriorate renal function. Both biomedical and clinical literature underscore that early detection of barrier disruption can serve as a surrogate marker for disease progression, making TEER a highly relevant metric for evaluating drug-induced protection or reversal of such detrimental changes (gerven2025thepotentialapplications pages 3-6, yeste2018engineeringandmonitoring pages 1-2).

Previous Use:
TEER assays have been extensively employed in both high-throughput screening and mechanistic studies across multiple epithelial cell models. For example, microfluidic systems have been designed to monitor real-time TEER changes in renal epithelial cells, effectively detecting barrier disruption upon exposure to toxins such as cisplatin, and more pertinently, upon TGF-β-induced EMT events (liang2023amicrofluidictool pages 11-15, takata2024onlinemonitoringof pages 3-4). Platforms such as the OrganoPlate enable automated, time-lapse TEER measurements, thus providing a sensitive readout that correlates with dynamic alterations in epithelial integrity. These approaches have not only demonstrated the ability to serve as early indicators of toxicity and EMT but have also been integrated into drug discovery pipelines aimed at screening compounds that preserve or restore epithelial barrier function (nicolas2021highthroughputtransepithelial pages 1-3, shaughnessey2022evaluationofrapid pages 12-13).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of the TEER barrier integrity assay include its non-invasive, real-time capability to detect subtle alterations in epithelial tight junction integrity, a critical factor in both early EMT and fibrotic development in CKD. The rapid electrode-based measurement facilitates high-throughput drug screening and can be easily integrated with complementary techniques such as immunostaining and high-content imaging for a multiparametric analysis of drug effects (nicolas2021highthroughputtransepithelial pages 7-9, tasinato2024developmentofan pages 307-310). Moreover, when applied in advanced culture systems—including co-culture models that replicate the proximal tubule–interstitial interface—the assay captures paracrine and cellular interactions that further refine its translational relevance (tasinato2024developmentofan pages 183-190).

However, the assay also has limitations. TEER measurements largely provide a functional readout of barrier integrity but lack the molecular detail to fully characterize downstream signaling events. Furthermore, variations in cell culture conditions and the choice of cell types can impact the reproducibility and sensitivity of the assay. In addition, TEER alone does not capture other key aspects of the CKD pathology, such as extracellular matrix remodeling or renal transporter dysfunction, which may require additional complementary assays to achieve a comprehensive therapeutic evaluation (yeste2018engineeringandmonitoring pages 11-13).

In conclusion, while the TEER barrier integrity assay is a powerful, rapid, and scalable method for probing key aspects of renal epithelial dysfunction and EMT relevant to CKD, its greatest strength lies in its integration into a multiparametric platform that includes complementary biochemical and imaging modalities, thereby overcoming its inherent limitations in isolation (gerven2025thepotentialapplications pages 3-6, nicolas2021highthroughputtransepithelial pages 4-5).
