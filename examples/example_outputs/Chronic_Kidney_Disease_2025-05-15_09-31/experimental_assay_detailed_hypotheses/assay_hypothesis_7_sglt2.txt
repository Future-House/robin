Assay Overview:
The proposed assay utilizes the fluorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG to quantitatively measure SGLT2-mediated glucose uptake in renal proximal tubule epithelial cell (RPTEC) monolayers. This assay aims to model the hyperreabsorption phenomenon seen in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) by assessing how SGLT2 activity contributes to increased intracellular glucose loads that subsequently enhance oxidative stress and metabolic perturbations. The key measurements include the fluorescence intensity corresponding to 2-NBDG uptake measured by microplate readers or through microscopy imaging, and the assay can be complemented by assessing downstream reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. HK-2 cells, a widely accepted RPTEC model that retains key epithelial and transporter characteristics, serve as the cell substrate; alternative primary human proximal tubular cells have also been discussed for achieving physiological relevance (lu2019afluorescentglucose pages 1-3, lu2019afluorescentglucose pages 3-5).

Biomedical Evidence:
The biomedical rationale for targeting SGLT2 in CKD stems from its central role in glucose reabsorption in proximal tubular cells. In diabetic nephropathy, persistent hyperglycemia causes an upregulation of SGLT2, leading to hyperreabsorption of glucose. This high intracellular glucose load is known to drive the production of ROS via several metabolic pathways, thereby contributing to both metabolic and oxidative stress that are intimately linked to the progression of CKD (eleftheriadis2020aunifyingmodel pages 1-2, zaibi2021protectiveeffectsof pages 2-4). Clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors not only lower blood glucose by promoting glucosuria, but also reduce inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in RPTEC, suggesting that assay readouts can inform on both transporter inhibition and secondary beneficial effects on cellular stress responses (baer2020nocytotoxicand pages 3-6). The ability to mimic these disease-relevant processes in vitro, using a nonradioactive, high-throughput fluorescent assay, positions this method as an attractive tool for early drug discovery and translational research in CKD (Clinical Trials Search: SGLT2 activity assay OR SGLT2 in vitro).

Previous Use:
Historically, the use of 2-NBDG fluorescence assays has been validated in studies examining SGLT2 function in HK-2 cells. For example, research by Lu et al. demonstrated that sodium-dependent uptake of 2-NBDG could be specifically inhibited by clinical SGLT2 inhibitors like dapagliflozin, confirming the assay’s specificity and sensitivity (lu2019afluorescentglucose pages 3-5). Additionally, similar fluorescent techniques have been applied in other renal cell models under hyperglycemic conditions to mimic diabetic nephropathy, thereby linking transporter function to oxidative stress and subsequent cellular injury (nongthombam2025breakingboundariesin pages 3-5). These studies underscore the assay’s utility in elucidating SGLT2-mediated mechanisms and have established its validity for drug screening and mechanistic studies targeting CKD pathophysiology (baer2020nocytotoxicand pages 14-15).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of the assay include its specificity for SGLT2 via sodium-dependent uptake assessments, its nonradioactive approach which improves safety and regulatory compliance, and its adaptability to high-throughput screening formats that are essential for early-stage drug discovery. The use of human RPTEC models, such as HK-2 cells, enhances the translational relevance compared to non-human or transfected cell lines (lu2019afluorescentglucose pages 1-3, chapron2018renaltubulartransport pages 54-58). Furthermore, the assay not only measures transporter activity but can also be coupled with additional readouts like ROS production, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of metabolic and oxidative stress associated with CKD.

On the downside, challenges include maintaining the physiological expression of SGLT2 over multiple passages and ensuring that the in vitro conditions adequately replicate the complex in vivo microenvironment of the kidney proximal tubule. Additionally, while the assay provides rapid readouts for SGLT2 inhibition, it may require integration with other models (such as 3D microphysiological systems) for full mechanistic insights into CKD progression (secker2018functionalapproachesto pages 125-127).

In summary, the SGLT2 uptake assay using 2-NBDG in RPTEC monolayers represents a robust and physiologically relevant approach for early-stage therapeutic evaluation in CKD, with strong support from both biomedical and clinical literature (lu2019afluorescentglucose pages 1-3, eleftheriadis2020aunifyingmodel pages 1-2).
