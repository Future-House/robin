Assay Overview:
The proposed assay employs the Seahorse metabolic flux platform to measure mitochondrial bioenergetics via oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in kidney tubular epithelial cells (TECs). This assay models key metabolic derangements implicated in chronic kidney disease (CKD) pathogenesis. It is designed to quantify dynamic shifts between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in response to drug treatment. Typically, primary TECs—isolated and characterized to preserve proximal and distal tubule markers—are cultured and then subjected to assays in specialized media. Mitochondrial inhibitors (e.g., oligomycin, FCCP, and rotenone/antimycin A) and metabolic substrates (e.g., palmitate conjugated to BSA in the presence or absence of glycolysis inhibitors) are applied sequentially to parse out basal respiration, ATP-linked respiration, maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity, and compensatory glycolysis (ding2018isolationcharacterizationand pages 3-4, ding2018isolationcharacterizationand pages 8-9).

Biomedical Evidence:
Mitochondrial dysfunction features prominently in CKD pathogenesis. Abnormalities in electron transport chain components, fatty acid oxidation, and overall cellular bioenergetics are observed in both experimental models and clinical cases of CKD. Studies have demonstrated that TECs in CKD models exhibit impaired mitochondrial respiration, reduced fatty acid oxidation capacity, and metabolic reprogramming that mirrors in vivo pathologies (li2021targetingmitochondriaand pages 7-8, thome2021mitochondrialbioenergeticand pages 16-17). Furthermore, clinical evidence indicates that defective mitochondrial bioenergetics correlates with renal functional decline, underscoring the relevance of directly measuring OCR and ECAR as surrogate markers for mitochondrial health (thome2021mitochondrialbioenergeticand pages 1-2). By capturing these functional parameters in real time, the Seahorse assay bridges the gap between cellular metabolism and CKD pathobiology, thereby enabling the identification and validation of therapeutics that restore mitochondrial function.

Previous Use:
The Seahorse metabolic flux assay has been successfully utilized to elucidate metabolic defects in renal cell culture models and animal models of CKD. For example, detailed protocols describe isolation and metabolic characterization of TECs using the Seahorse platform, where changes in OCR and ECAR provided mechanistic insights into mitochondrial dysfunction and a shift in substrate utilization—particularly a reliance on defective fatty acid oxidation in fibrotic versus healthy cells (ding2018isolationcharacterizationand pages 4-8, ding2018isolationcharacterizationand pages 8-9). Additionally, this assay has been applied in drug screening efforts, where candidate compounds were evaluated for their ability to improve bioenergetic parameters, thus linking OCR/ECAR profiles to therapeutic efficacy (podrini2018dissectionofmetabolic pages 11-12). The platform’s sensitivity has also made it a mainstay in other mitochondrial studies involving renal tissues, providing a robust means to dissect metabolic reprogramming in CKD and related disease models (thome2021mitochondrialbioenergeticand pages 19-20).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of this assay lie in its real-time, high-throughput capacity to quantitatively assess key parameters of mitochondrial function. Its ability to dissect complex bioenergetic profiles—ranging from basal respiration to maximal respiratory capacity and glycolytic compensation—makes it a compelling tool for early-stage drug discovery in CKD (ding2018isolationcharacterizationand pages 2-3, ding2018isolationcharacterizationand pages 8-9). The assay is highly relevant, given that mitochondrial dysfunction is a core component of CKD pathogenesis, supported by both biomedical and clinical studies (thome2021mitochondrialbioenergeticand pages 16-17, li2021targetingmitochondriaand pages 7-8).

However, some weaknesses exist. In vitro TEC models may not fully recapitulate the in vivo complexity of CKD, where systemic influences such as uremic toxins and hemodynamic changes also drive disease progression. Furthermore, variability in cell isolation methods and passage-dependent changes in mitochondrial function might limit reproducibility and translational relevance (ding2018isolationcharacterizationand pages 8-9). Nonetheless, when combined with complementary approaches, such as transcriptomics and proteomics (thome2021mitochondrialbioenergeticand pages 19-20), the Seahorse metabolic flux assay remains a highly valuable tool for mechanistic studies and preclinical therapeutic screening in CKD research.
