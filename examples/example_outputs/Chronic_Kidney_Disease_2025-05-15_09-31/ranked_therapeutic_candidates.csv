"OLT1177 (Dapansutrile; InvivoGen, catalog #tlrl-olt1177)","Proposal for OLT1177 (Dapansutrile; InvivoGen, catalog #tlrl-olt1177)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
OLT1177, also known as dapansutrile, is a synthetic small-molecule inhibitor that belongs to the β-sulfonyl nitrile class of compounds, developed specifically for its selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The compound was synthesized via a chemically directed approach—in particular, its synthesis involved an alkylation reaction of sodium methanesulfinate with 3-bromopropionitrile, yielding a β-sulfonyl nitrile moiety that confers its inhibitory activity (Marchetti et al., 2018). This class of small molecule inhibitors has been widely explored for targeting inflammatory pathways through modulation of innate immune responses. Historically, β-sulfonyl nitrile compounds have attracted attention as therapeutic agents due to their capacity to engage key protein domains involved in inflammation while maintaining selectivity and oral bioavailability, attributes that are critical for chronic treatment regimens (Marchetti et al., 2018).

Therapeutic History:
OLT1177 has progressed through several stages of development and clinical evaluation in diseases characterized by uncontrolled inflammation, notably in acute gout flares, heart failure, and conditions linked to cytokine release syndromes. In Phase I clinical trials, dapansutrile demonstrated an excellent safety profile when administered to healthy subjects at dosages up to 1000 mg per day for 8 days, thereby establishing its tolerability and preliminary evidence of target engagement (Jansen et al., 2019). Moreover, therapeutic evaluations in inflammatory settings—such as a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study in patients with NYHA II–III systolic heart failure—further underscored its favorable safety profile and pharmacodynamic effects despite the fact that current clinical investigations have not directly targeted Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) populations (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical studies in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy have demonstrated that treatment with OLT1177 leads to significant reductions in renal IL-1β levels, decreased macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis, suggesting that its benefits extend to kidney-related inflammatory damage (Mulay, 2019). Although clinical trials specifically focused on CKD or renal inflammation are lacking at this point, the robust anti-inflammatory effects observed in related models and conditions provide a sound rationale for repurposing OLT1177 in chronic kidney disease.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, OLT1177 selectively inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by targeting its central NACHT domain, where it interferes with ATPase activity that is critical for the oligomerization process necessary for inflammasome assembly. Under normal conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggers the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), leading to the formation of a multi-protein complex that activates caspase-1 and drives the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) (Kim et al., 2019). OLT1177 binds specifically to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, thereby blocking the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC, which is a necessary event for full inflammasome assembly (Marchetti et al., 2018). In doing so, it prevents the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-1 and effectively reduces the secretion of IL-1β. This mechanism is particularly significant in environments of hyperglycemic stress, where increased NLRP3 activity in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) drives inflammation, pyroptotic cell death, and subsequent tubulointerstitial fibrosis (Mulay, 2019). Additionally, by curtailing downstream cytokine release and pyroptosis, OLT1177 is believed to mitigate the metabolic cost of inflammation, an effect that has been observed in multiple preclinical in vivo studies in conditions ranging from acute arthritis to cardiac dysfunction (Jansen et al., 2019; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis is that through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, OLT1177 will effectively block the recruitment of ASC and disrupt subsequent caspase-1 activation in renal tubular cells, particularly under conditions of hyperglycemia which are common in diabetic nephropathy. Under hyperglycemic stress, renal tubular epithelial cells exhibit increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and aberrant inflammasome activation resulting in heightened secretion of IL-1β, a cytokine implicated in promoting fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition. By preventing the cleavage of pro-IL-1β into its active form, OLT1177 is expected to prevent pyroptotic cell death of TECs and interrupt the deleterious cycle of inflammation-driven fibrogenesis in the kidney (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Evidence from animal models indicates that selective blockade of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to a marked decrease in renal inflammation as evidenced by reduced macrophage infiltration and lower profibrotic cytokine levels, which supports the expectation that OLT1177 could yield appreciable renoprotective outcomes in CKD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In the proposed assay, it is anticipated that OLT1177 will reduce markers of inflammation such as IL-1β and IL-18 in the culture medium of hyperglycemia-stressed TECs, thereby correlating with decreased pyroptosis and improved cell viability. This would be further corroborated by downstream effects such as reduced activation of profibrotic pathways, including lower TGF-β signaling and diminished deposition of fibrotic markers, ultimately mitigating the progression toward renal fibrosis (Cliff, 2023; Mulay, 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate with substantial potential for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease owing to its well-characterized mechanism of action, favorable preclinical results, and established safety profile in early clinical studies. One of the major strengths of OLT1177 lies in its selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an attractive target given the critical role of NLRP3 in mediating renal inflammation, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenesis. Its synthetic origins and robust medicinal chemistry underpin its precise targeting of the NACHT domain in NLRP3, effectively sparing other inflammasomes and reducing the risk of broad immunosuppression (Marchetti et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Furthermore, its oral bioavailability and metabolic stability make it suitable for chronic administration, an essential consideration for CKD where long-term therapy is required (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

From a therapeutic history perspective, although OLT1177 has not yet been directly tested in human CKD patient populations, its successful progression through Phase I trials for conditions such as gout and heart failure, combined with promising data in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy, strongly supports its potential utility in renal settings (Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Preclinical studies show reduced renal IL-1β secretion, diminished macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis when NLRP3 is inhibited by agents like OLT1177, lending biological credence to the hypothesis that inflammasome inhibition could slow CKD progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

At the molecular level, the precise action of OLT1177—binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ASC recruitment—represents a highly targeted approach that contrasts with cytokine-neutralizing therapies such as anti-IL-1β antibodies. This specificity is advantageous because it not only prevents the generation of IL-1β but also curtails the activation of NFκB and other downstream inflammatory cascades, potentially reducing off-target effects and preserving broader immune competence (Marchetti et al., 2018; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020). Additionally, the expected anti-inflammatory effects in renal tubular cells—specifically preventing pyroptosis and fibrogenesis—are consistent with literature demonstrating that NLRP3 is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells under hyperglycemic and inflammatory stress (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).

However, several challenges remain. One of the limitations stems from the current lack of direct clinical evidence in CKD populations; while animal models provide a strong rationale, the translation of these findings into human CKD may be complicated by the multifactorial nature of the disease, where multiple pathways contribute to renal injury beyond inflammasome activation. Additionally, the chronic nature of CKD necessitates prolonged administration of therapeutic agents, and long-term safety data for OLT1177 in such a setting are still pending. There is also the possibility that inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome might impair necessary innate immune responses, although the specificity of OLT1177 for the NLRP3 complex—in contrast to more generalized anti-inflammatory agents—should, in theory, mitigate this concern (Seok et al., 2021).

Moreover, while the preclinical data in models of diabetic nephropathy and crystal-induced kidney injury are promising, variability in genetic and environmental factors in human CKD could affect the compound’s efficacy. It will therefore be critical to design dedicated clinical trials in defined CKD populations, ideally incorporating biomarkers of inflammasome activity, such as circulating IL-1β and IL-18 levels, as well as imaging and functional assessments of renal fibrosis and function. The anti-fibrotic effects, in particular, warrant closer mechanistic studies to confirm that inhibition of TEC pyroptosis and preservation of tubular integrity occur in the human kidney as they do in animal models (Williams et al., 2022; Cliff, 2023).

In conclusion, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) represents a compelling candidate for repurposing in Chronic Kidney Disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, favorable pharmacological profile, and preclinical evidence supporting its renoprotective effects. Its ability to directly inhibit the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding to the NACHT domain and blocking ASC recruitment addresses a critical upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that leads to caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and subsequent pyroptosis of renal tubular cells. This mode of action has the potential to attenuate the inflammation-driven fibrogenesis that is central to CKD progression, particularly in diabetic nephropathy where hyperglycemic stress is a key driver of renal injury.

Strengths of OLT1177 include its synthetic origin allowing for structural optimization, its demonstrated safety in Phase I clinical trials, its oral bioavailability which is advantageous for chronic therapy, and its selective inhibitory action that minimizes off-target effects. Additionally, existing preclinical studies showing reduced renal IL-1β, diminished macrophage infiltration, and lowered fibrotic responses in models of nephropathy provide a promising foundation for further exploration in CKD (Mulay, 2019; Jansen et al., 2019).

Weaknesses or challenges include the current absence of dedicated clinical trials in CKD, the complexity of CKD pathophysiology where multiple inflammatory and fibrotic pathways are involved, and the potential risk that chronic inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome could in some contexts compromise the host defense or alter essential cellular processes. These concerns underscore the need for carefully designed preclinical studies specifically in renal disease models, followed by early phase clinical trials in well-defined CKD populations to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and long-term safety.

Overall, based on the comprehensive literature review, the mechanistic rationale, and the encouraging preclinical and early clinical data available, OLT1177 shows significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease. The next steps should involve further detailed studies in CKD-specific preclinical models that assess not only inflammatory cytokine modulation but also functional outcomes such as glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria reduction, and fibrosis attenuation. A robust clinical development program targeting patients with diabetic nephropathy and other forms of CKD characterized by inflammasome activation would be the logical progression to validate its clinical utility (Marchetti et al., 2018; Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).

"VX-765 (Belnacasan; InvivoGen, catalog #tlrl-vg765)","Proposal for VX-765 (Belnacasan; InvivoGen, catalog #tlrl-vg765)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
VX-765 (Belnacasan) is an orally bioavailable small‐molecule prodrug that is metabolized in vivo to yield the active metabolite VRT-043198, a selective irreversible inhibitor of inflammatory caspase‐1. It belongs to the class of caspase-1 inhibitors, which are designed to target the proteolytic enzyme caspase‐1 responsible for the post-translational processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Originally discovered through efforts to identify small molecules that could modulate inflammasome-mediated inflammation, VX-765 was synthesized to covalently interact with the catalytic cysteine residue of caspase‐1 and thereby block its activity. This group of compounds is part of a broader category of anti-inflammatory agents that have been applied in conditions where excessive inflammasome activation leads to tissue damage, and they have been used in clinical studies for disorders such as epilepsy and psoriasis, demonstrating that this drug class can effectively modulate immune signaling pathways and cytokine maturation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).

Therapeutic History:
VX-765 has an established history in preclinical and early clinical research. It has advanced into Phase II trials in both epilepsy and psoriasis, conditions associated with chronic inflammation and abnormal cytokine signaling, thereby establishing a safety profile and demonstrating adequate target engagement in humans. Although it has not been widely evaluated in clinical trials specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), preclinical studies conducted in rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) have demonstrated that VX-765 effectively reduces markers of inflammation such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), diminishes macrophage infiltration, and reduces collagen deposition, which are indicative of reduced fibrotic remodeling in the kidney (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024). Additionally, the general class of caspase-1 inhibitors has been successfully applied in various inflammatory conditions, and mechanistic studies suggest that inhibiting caspase-1 can interrupt the cascade leading to pyroptotic cell death—a key factor in inflammatory tissue damage. Although there is no large-scale clinical trial data in CKD to date, the compound’s mechanism, coupled with existing human safety data from other indications, strongly supports its rapid repurposing potential for kidney diseases (Sanz et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
VX-765’s mechanism of action is centered on the selective inhibition of caspase-1, an essential enzyme involved in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, and in mediating a form of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that VX-765 is a prodrug that is metabolized into VRT-043198, which binds irreversibly to the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys285) in the active site of caspase-1 through covalent interactions. Structural analyses, including crystallography experiments, have elucidated that VRT-043198 makes additional hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with key residues (e.g., R179, Q283, P343, and R383) ensuring a high degree of selectivity for inflammatory caspases over apoptotic caspases (Yang, 2019). By blocking caspase-1, VX-765 prevents the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active cytokine forms, thereby reducing the release of these potent inflammatory mediators; it also prevents the cleavage of gasdermin D, a critical effector protein required to form membrane pores that mediate pyroptotic cell death. In renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and other cell types implicated in kidney disease, such proclivity for pyroptosis can drive local inflammatory cascades and fibrotic signaling, so inhibiting caspase-1 may mitigate these processes (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). The specificity of VX-765 for caspase-1 has been confirmed through both in vitro assays—with assessments of IL-1β release and gasdermin D cleavage—and in vivo models where administration of VX-765 led to reduced serum IL-1β, improved survival in sepsis models, and attenuation of inflammatory tissue injury (Yang, 2019; Liu et al., 2023).

Expected Effect in Chronic Kidney Disease:
In the context of Chronic Kidney Disease, particularly conditions characterized by diabetic nephropathy and renal fibrosis, the hypothesis is that VX-765 will reduce caspase-1 mediated pyroptosis and subsequent inflammatory cytokine release in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). TEC pyroptosis contributes to tubular cell death and triggers a deleterious inflammatory milieu that ultimately drives fibrotic remodeling through the activation of myofibroblasts and increased deposition of extracellular matrix components such as collagen. VX-765 is expected to block this cascade at an early step by preventing the activation of caspase-1, thereby limiting IL-1β and IL-18 maturation and secretion. This, in turn, should reduce the recruitment and activation of inflammatory macrophages—a process that has been shown to contribute to fibrogenesis in the kidney (Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Preclinical evidence from rodent models supports that administration of VX-765 leads to decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced expression of pro-fibrotic markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and a lower deposition of collagen, thereby preserving renal tubular structure and function. Considering caspase-1 and the inflammasome complex are expressed in renal cells including TECs and resident macrophages, targeting caspase-1 is a rational approach to interrupt the feedback loop between cell death and inflammation that exacerbates CKD progression (Zhou & Li, 2023; Sanz et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of VX-765 as a therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease include its well-defined mechanism of action, oral bioavailability, and the fact that it has already undergone Phase II clinical trials in other indications, demonstrating an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in humans. The mechanistic rationale is strong: by targeting caspase-1, VX-765 interrupts the inflammasome-driven cascade responsible for both pyroptotic cell death and the maturation of key pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in renal fibrosis. Preclinical models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction have provided promising evidence that caspase-1 inhibition can reduce renal inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and extracellular matrix deposition, suggesting that VX-765 might slow the progression of fibrotic changes in CKD (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). Furthermore, targeting a central mediator such as caspase-1 may have broader benefits by influencing several downstream inflammatory pathways simultaneously, thus potentially overcoming the limitations of therapies that target individual cytokines.
Weaknesses include the translational gap that currently exists between preclinical efficacy in rodent models and clinical benefit in human CKD patients. Although VX-765 has demonstrated safety in epilepsy and psoriasis trials, the long-term effects of inhibiting caspase-1 in a chronic disease setting like CKD are not fully understood, particularly given the complex roles that inflammasome signaling may play in tissue repair, host defense, and kidney homeostasis. There is also the possibility that fully inhibiting caspase-1 could lead to compensatory activation of alternative inflammatory pathways or unintended off-target effects, especially in patients with compromised kidney function. Additionally, while preclinical data are encouraging, there is a need for dedicated clinical trials in CKD and related fibrotic conditions to establish the optimal dosing, efficacy, and safety profile in this specific patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).
Overall, VX-765 exhibits several promising attributes as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for CKD: its defined molecular target, demonstrated anti-inflammatory mechanism through caspase-1 inhibition, and supportive preclinical evidence of renoprotection provide a compelling rationale for further investigation. The strengths of existing human safety data and oral administration combine with a robust mechanistic framework to justify advancing VX-765 into clinical trials in patients with CKD. Nonetheless, further research is required to clarify long-term effects on renal function, potential compensatory inflammatory mechanisms, and the detailed pharmacodynamics in the setting of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. With carefully designed clinical studies focusing on renal endpoints, VX-765 could represent a valuable addition to the therapeutic arsenal against CKD, particularly for patients whose disease is driven significantly by inflammasome-mediated inflammation and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Zhou & Li, 2023).

"Tranilast (MedChemExpress, catalog #HY-50819)","Proposal for Tranilast (MedChemExpress, catalog #HY-50819)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tranilast, commercially available from MedChemExpress (catalog #HY-50819), is a small-molecule synthetic compound originally developed as an anti-allergic agent. Chemically, it is an anthranilic acid derivative, specifically N-[3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl]-anthranilic acid, synthesized initially to treat allergic conditions such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and cutaneous disorders, including keloids and hypertrophic scars (Gilbert et al., 2012). The compound belongs to a class of agents that modulate inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways. The early synthesis of tranilast involved modifying the cinnamoyl anthranilate moiety to enhance potency against pro-fibrotic mediators like transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) while maintaining an acceptable toxicity profile. Over time, the compound’s anti-allergic properties were expanded by preclinical findings that demonstrated its potential to inhibit fibrotic changes via modulation of cytokine signaling and cellular proliferation pathways. This class of anthranilic acid derivatives has been used both in dermatologic and immunologic contexts, providing a background of clinical utility and safety that benefits the repurposing efforts for conditions such as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (Gilbert et al., 2012).

Therapeutic History:
Tranilast has a well-documented history in clinical settings as an anti-allergic drug since its introduction in Japan decades ago. Its traditional indications have included treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and prevention of keloid formation. More recently, emerging preclinical studies have evaluated tranilast for its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in multiple organ systems. Notably, in experimental animal models of renal disease, tranilast has been investigated in contexts such as diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In these models, tranilast demonstrated the ability to reduce proteinuria, improve kidney structural integrity, and diminish collagen deposition (Gilbert et al., 2012). For instance, in diabetic nephropathy studies, tranilast reduced albuminuria and slowed the decline in glomerular filtration rate through attenuation of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix accumulation. Additionally, human studies in early-stage CKD patients, particularly those with diabetic nephropathy, receiving tranilast combined with standard therapies such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs have shown reductions in urinary markers like collagen type IV and albumin excretion (Gilbert et al., 2012). Beyond renal applications, the compound’s repurposing has been explored in cardiovascular contexts and even in certain inflammatory conditions driven by aberrant inflammasome activation, suggesting a versatility that supports further investigation into its utility against CKD. However, review of ClinicalTrials.gov did not reveal any registered trials directly assessing tranilast in CKD or related renal fibrosis, indicating that while preclinical and limited clinical observations are encouraging, robust clinical evaluation in CKD remains to be undertaken (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
The hypothesized mechanism for tranilast in CKD centers on its ability to inhibit key inflammatory and fibrotic processes via direct intervention in inflammasome biology. Tranilast’s molecular target is the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex that plays a pivotal role in innate inflammatory responses. The assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires a coordinated interaction among NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and the serine/threonine kinase NEK7. Activation of this complex ultimately leads to the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form, which subsequently processes pro-IL-1β into IL-1β, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that drives pyroptosis and contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Specifically, tranilast is proposed to disrupt the critical interactions between NLRP3 and ASC as well as between NLRP3 and NEK7. This disruption is believed to occur via direct binding to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3, which is essential for its oligomerization and subsequent recruitment of ASC. By preventing ASC oligomerization, tranilast effectively halts the assembly of the inflammasome, thereby blocking caspase-1 activation and reducing IL-1β secretion (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).

In addition to inflammasome disruption, tranilast has been shown to attenuate TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling—another major contributor to kidney disease progression. TGF-β is well documented as a central mediator of extracellular matrix synthesis and fibroblast activation, and its overexpression in chronic kidney injury drives interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. Tranilast’s inhibition of TGF-β signaling includes the suppression of Smad2 phosphorylation and downstream fibrotic responses, leading to reductions in collagen deposition and interstitial matrix accumulation (Gilbert et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2019). Furthermore, tranilast’s capacity to inhibit PDGF signaling reduces mesangial cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in the renal glomerulus, providing an additional mechanistic avenue through which it exerts its renoprotective effects (Gilbert et al., 2012).

Expected Effect:
Given the proposed mechanism, the expected effect of tranilast in a CKD context is to attenuate tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis by mitigating both inflammatory and fibrotic signaling. In tubular epithelial cells (TECs), oxidative stress triggers activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in IL-1β secretion and pyroptotic cell death—a process that not only damages the epithelial barrier but also leads to further recruitment of inflammatory cells. By interfering with the NLRP3–ASC and NLRP3–NEK7 interactions, tranilast is anticipated to reduce caspase-1 activation. Consequently, a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis is expected, which would alleviate tubular inflammation under conditions of oxidative stress (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).

Furthermore, the reduction in IL-1β and subsequent dampening of the inflammatory cascade should also lead to a decrease in TGF-β release. TGF-β is critically involved in driving fibroblast activation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. Thus, by curtailing the initial inflammasome-mediated inflammatory trigger, tranilast indirectly reduces TGF-β levels, thereby preventing its downstream pro-fibrotic effects. This is particularly relevant in diabetic nephropathy and UUO models, where TGF-β-mediated fibrosis is a major determinant of disease progression (Chen et al., 2020; Gilbert et al., 2012).

In summary, the expected outcome in an in vitro or in vivo CKD assay would be a demonstrable decrease in markers of inflammation (such as IL-1β levels), reduced caspase-1 activity, diminished pyroptosis (as measured by LDH release or similar assays), and lowered expression of fibrotic markers including collagen, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Moreover, the preservation of tubular epithelial cell integrity and a consequent improvement in overall kidney function would provide functional support for tranilast’s therapeutic efficacy in CKD (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Tranilast represents a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease based on its dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. From a mechanistic standpoint, its ability to selectively disrupt the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting key protein–protein interactions (specifically between NLRP3, ASC, and NEK7) underpins its potential to reduce caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. This targeted mechanism is particularly attractive because it distinguishes tranilast from broader-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs that may have off-target effects. Moreover, by concurrently attenuating TGF-β signaling pathways, tranilast can reduce fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition—both critical contributors to the progression of CKD (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019).

A major strength of tranilast is its established clinical use as an anti-allergic agent over several decades, which provides a substantial record of safety and tolerability in humans. Its oral dosing regimen further facilitates rapid clinical repurposing for CKD. Preclinical studies in animal models of diabetic nephropathy and UUO have demonstrated measurable benefits, such as reduced proteinuria and improved renal histology, lending support to its potential efficacy in human CKD (Gilbert et al., 2012).

However, there are certain weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Despite promising preclinical data, there is a noted absence of registered clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with tranilast (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), which indicates that further clinical validation is required. Moreover, while tranilast’s inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is supported by various mechanistic studies, the precise molecular details—such as confirmation of binding to the LRR domain of NLRP3 and the exact nature of its impact on NEK7 interactions—require further elucidation through biochemical and structural studies (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). In addition, as with any repurposed drug, careful evaluation of potential off-target immunomodulatory effects is necessary. There have been reports of immune-mediated adverse events in other clinical indications, which, although not prominent, must be monitored during chronic administration in CKD patients (Strilchuk et al., 2019).

In conclusion, the body of preclinical literature strongly supports the hypothesis that tranilast can disrupt NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and attenuate subsequent inflammatory and fibrotic cascades in the kidney. Given its dual mechanism—inhibiting both inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion and TGF-β–mediated fibrosis—tranilast emerges as an attractive candidate for repurposing in CKD. Its established use in other indications and favorable oral bioavailability further underscore its potential for rapid clinical translation. Nonetheless, the lack of direct clinical trial evidence in renal disease and the need for further mechanistic clarification represent critical challenges that the research team must address in subsequent studies (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023). Overall, the strengths of mechanistic specificity and a well-established safety profile position tranilast as a promising drug candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease, warranting further investigation through comprehensive preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials.

"MCC950 (CP-456,773; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #SML 2233)","Proposal for MCC950 (CP-456,773; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #SML 2233)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MCC950, also known as CP-456,773, is a synthetic small-molecule drug originally developed as one of the first highly selective inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome. It belongs to the diarylsulfonylurea class of compounds, which emerged from medicinal chemistry efforts that initially focused on sulfonylurea drugs such as glyburide. Glyburide was found to have anti‐inflammatory properties mediated by inhibition of the NLRP3 complex; however, its clinical utility as an anti-inflammatory agent was limited by its potent effects on insulin release and the consequent risk of hypoglycemia. To overcome these limitations, researchers refined the chemical structure and synthesized MCC950, a derivative that retains the inflammasome inhibitory activity of glyburide without disturbing insulin secretion. The design of MCC950 was based on structure–activity relationship studies that identified the importance of the diarylsulfonylurea moiety, and its eventual discovery positioned it as a gold-standard benchmark compound for NLRP3 inhibition (Kaur et al., 2025; Coll et al., 2019). This compound has been synthesized and purified by several vendors including Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #SML 2233), ensuring reproducibility and accessibility to research teams. Overall, MCC950 represents a promising example of rational drug design aimed at selectively targeting components of the innate immune system and addressing the inflammatory cascades that contribute to disease pathology.

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of MCC950 is marked by extensive preclinical evidence spanning animal models of a wide array of inflammatory disorders. Initially investigated in models of auto-inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, MCC950 quickly emerged as the benchmark inhibitor for studying NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated inflammation. In rodent models of kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, and adenine-induced chronic renal failure, MCC950 has demonstrated significant reductions in proteinuria, attenuated fibrosis, and improvements in overall renal function (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). Preclinical studies conducted in diabetic models have shown that chronic treatment with MCC950 leads to marked improvements in histopathological kidney damage, as evidenced by reduced mesangial expansion and decreased podocyte injury (Zhang et al., 2019). In addition, rodent studies in salt-sensitive hypertensive models reveal that inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome via MCC950 results in lower blood pressure, decreased interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, and reduced collagen deposition in renal tissues (Krishnan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2025). Although robust evidence from animal studies supports its efficacy in models of chronic kidney disease (CKD), clinical translation remains limited with only sparse early-phase clinical trials referenced in the literature (ClinicalTrials.gov). Additionally, the favorable safety profile observed in non-human primate studies further underpins its potential for repurposing in CKD, although more clinical data are needed to fully establish its benefit–risk profile.

Mechanism of Action:
MCC950’s mechanism of action is both specific and well-characterized at the molecular level. The compound exerts its inhibitory effect by directly binding to the Walker B motif located within the NACHT domain of the NLRP3 protein. This binding interferes with the ATP hydrolysis that is essential for NLRP3 activation and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Under normal pathological conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC and the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form. Active caspase-1 then processes pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature forms and also initiates gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death. By preventing ATP hydrolysis, MCC950 locks NLRP3 in an inactive conformation, thereby obstructing the assembly of the entire inflammasome complex, reducing caspase-1 activation and cytokine maturation (Kim et al., 2019; Zhan et al., 2023). In the context of human tubular epithelial cells (TECs), which express NLRP3 and contribute to renal inflammatory cascades, MCC950’s engagement with the Walker B motif is proposed to significantly curb inflammasome formation. Such direct target engagement has been validated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and mutagenesis assays that confirm the drug’s specificity and potency. Blocking inflammasome assembly not only reduces cytokine release but also limits the formation of gasdermin D pores that are responsible for pyroptotic cell death, thereby preventing tubular cell loss and reducing interstitial inflammation (Liu et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
Given its robust preclinical evidence, the expected effect of MCC950 in assays focusing on CKD and related kidney injury is multifaceted. In in vitro models using human TECs, the hypothesis is that treatment with MCC950 will prevent ATP hydrolysis, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. As a result, the maturation and release of IL-1β and IL-18 will be significantly reduced, ultimately leading to lower levels of pyroptosis, attenuation of inflammation, and prevention of the fibrotic remodeling that often accompanies progressive CKD (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). In vivo, these effects are anticipated to manifest as decreased proteinuria, improved kidney function markers, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, and lower extracellular matrix deposition. This translates into a reduction in renal interstitial fibrosis and a preservation of normal tubular architecture, thereby ameliorating the progressive decline in renal function seen in CKD models. The expression profile of NLRP3 in TECs, coupled with its established role in mediating inflammatory and fibrotic responses, provides a solid rationale for targeting NLRP3 in chronic kidney disease (Zhang et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). The proposed mechanism is in alignment with the pathological features of CKD, where sustained low-grade inflammation and fibrosis lead to irreversible kidney damage.

Overall Evaluation:
MCC950 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease due to several compelling strengths. First, its rational design as a selective NLRP3 inhibitor ensures that it directly targets a critical inflammatory pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of CKD. The extensive preclinical evidence in diverse animal models—from diabetic nephropathy to salt-sensitive hypertension and adenine-induced renal failure—strongly supports its renoprotective effects, including reductions in proteinuria, improved renal function, and diminished fibrotic remodeling (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Sabra et al., 2023). Second, the detailed elucidation of its molecular mechanism—confirming binding to the Walker B motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ATP hydrolysis—provides a clear mechanistic rationale that is essential for translational development (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Third, its favorable pharmacological properties, including oral bioavailability and a safety profile established in non-human primates, further underline its developmental feasibility (Kaur et al., 2025; ClinicalTrials.gov).

However, there are some potential weaknesses that must be carefully considered. Although rodent models have provided robust efficacy data, the translation of these effects to humans remains to be fully validated. There is a paucity of comprehensive clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with MCC950, which introduces uncertainty regarding its efficacy and potential off-target effects in a human patient population. Additionally, while the compound is highly selective for the NLRP3 inflammasome, it is critical to further elucidate its long-term safety and impact on global immune function, given the essential role of inflammasomes in host defense. In some experimental contexts, there has been variability in the inhibition of inflammation and fibrosis depending on the specific disease model, suggesting that its therapeutic window may differ based on disease etiology (Sabra et al., 2023). Despite these challenges, the overall evidence supports the further development of MCC950 as a mechanistic intervention in CKD, particularly in settings where inflammasome-driven pathology is predominant.

In summary, MCC950 is a well-characterized, rationally designed NLRP3 inhibitor with strong preclinical evidence demonstrating its renoprotective effects in various models of chronic kidney disease. Its specific binding to the Walker B motif of the NLRP3 NACHT domain and subsequent inhibition of ATP hydrolysis form the basis of its mechanism, reducing caspase-1 activation, IL-1β/IL-18 maturation, and gasdermin-D-mediated pyroptosis. These actions are expected to translate into reduced tubular epithelial cell death, diminished interstitial inflammation, and alleviation of fibrotic remodeling—key pathological processes in CKD progression. While further clinical validation is necessary, the strengths in mechanistic rationale, preclinical efficacy data, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties position MCC950 as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Coll et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022).

"Brilliant Blue G (BBG; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #B0770)","Proposal for Brilliant Blue G (BBG; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #B0770)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Brilliant Blue G (BBG) is a synthetic dye originally developed for use in food and as a surgical visualizing agent that has been repurposed as a pharmacological agent. BBG is part of the broad class of blue dyes that have been extensively studied for their ability to interact with the purinergic receptor family, most notably acting as a non‐competitive antagonist of the P2X7 receptor. The compound’s chemical structure confers high water solubility and the ability to be administered at defined doses with a favorable safety profile, as demonstrated by its routine use in ophthalmic surgery and CNS studies without systemic toxicity. In its role as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, BBG has been used in various preclinical studies investigating inflammatory and cell death pathways. Its synthetic origin and established manufacturing process, as offered by suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #B0770), support its scalability for repurposing in chronic diseases. BBG belongs to a class of small molecules that modulate ion channel function, particularly by binding to the ATP‐activated P2X7 receptor, which has been implicated in various inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. This class of compounds has been employed not only for their staining properties but also for their ability to interfere with cellular signaling events related to inflammation, rendering them of considerable interest in conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD) where inflammation and fibrosis are critical pathogenic factors (Ferreira et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Brilliant Blue G has been most widely recognized as a histological staining agent with established safety in both preclinical and clinical contexts, particularly within the neuroprotective field. Its pharmacological actions extend to antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, and preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in animal models of inflammatory diseases, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and various neurodegenerative conditions. More recently, BBG has been evaluated in rodent models of kidney disease. For example, in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) models—a widely used experimental model that mimics tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis—BBG treatment has been observed to reduce inflammation, diminish interstitial fibrosis, and promote tubular cell regeneration (Pereira et al., 2020). In rodent hypertensive nephropathy models, BBG has also been reported to modulate renal vascular resistance and alter tubular injury markers, suggesting that its renoprotective effects might extend to a broader spectrum of CKD–related pathologies. Although clinical trials directly targeting chronic kidney disease with BBG have not yet been detailed in the public literature, searches in ClinicalTrials.gov using terms related to “Brilliant Blue G OR P2X7 antagonist OR P2X7 inhibitor OR NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have identified several ongoing studies investigating similar P2X7 blockade strategies in CKD, which support the translational potential of this approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Prior investigations in animal models of lupus nephritis and hypertensive kidney disease have indicated that BBG’s anti‐inflammatory profile, including decreased IL-1β levels and reduced macrophage infiltration, is conducive to preventing progressive renal damage (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020). Veterinary and preclinical applications in models of inflammatory injury provide a solid foundation for repurposing BBG as a potential therapeutic candidate in conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, such as CKD.

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism by which BBG is hypothesized to exert its renoprotective effects in CKD is centered on its ability to non‐competitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor present on both renal immune and epithelial cells. The P2X7 receptor is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated cation channel that is activated under pathophysiological conditions where extracellular ATP levels are elevated, which frequently occurs during tissue injury and inflammation. Once activated, the P2X7 receptor facilitates the formation of pores in the plasma membrane that allow for the influx of cations and the efflux of cellular contents, thereby precipitating a cascade of intracellular events. One critical downstream consequence of P2X7 activation is the priming and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that, upon activation, recruits the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and pro-caspase-1. This assembly leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase-1, which in turn processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, resulting in their secretion and the amplification of the inflammatory response. Moreover, P2X7 activation can induce pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that further exacerbates tissue injury and inflammation (Arulkumaran, 2016).

BBG exerts its effects via a noncompetitive blockade of the P2X7 receptor. In doing so, BBG prevents ATP-induced ion channel opening, thereby blocking the subsequent calcium influx and pore formation that are necessary for downstream inflammasome priming. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that BBG inhibits P2X7 receptor-mediated responses, including the calcium influx and the release of IL-1β from macrophages and other immune cells. In vitro studies with BBG have revealed nanomolar potency in blocking P2X7-mediated activities, which is reflective of its efficacy in dampening the inflammasome-related cytokine cascades (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019). Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that BBG may also interfere with pannexin-1 channels that are thought to facilitate ATP release and further promote inflammasome activation, although the precise relationship between pannexin-1 and P2X7 remains the subject of active research (Ferreira et al., 2016). Consequently, by inhibiting the P2X7 receptor, BBG blocks the ATP-driven initiation of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade. This blockade limits caspase-1 activation and the subsequent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, ultimately reducing local inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrotic remodeling within the renal parenchyma. Evidence from animal models indicates that such inhibition leads to reduced macrophage infiltration, decreased fibrogenic markers, and enhanced tubular cell regeneration, which collectively preserve the integrity of the tubulointerstitial architecture (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).

Expected Effect:
Given the established mechanistic pathway, BBG is expected to exert multifaceted renoprotective effects when applied to models of chronic kidney disease. In the proposed assay evaluating drug effects on renal cells, the expected outcome would involve a significant reduction in ATP-induced inflammasome activation. Specifically, by antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, BBG should lower the levels of active caspase-1, thereby reducing the maturation and extracellular release of IL-1β. This attenuation of inflammasome activation is expected to diminish pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells and mitigate pro-inflammatory cytokine release from resident macrophages. BBG’s inhibition of these pathways would theoretically preserve tubular architecture and limit interstitial fibrosis—a hallmark of progressive CKD. The renoprotective effect is anticipated to be observed as decreased expression of fibrosis markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and heat shock protein-47 (HSP47), as well as reduced collagen deposition, as evidenced in rodent models of UUO and hypertensive nephropathy (Pereira et al., 2020).

At the molecular level, renal epithelial cells, particularly proximal tubular cells, express both P2X7 receptors and components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Immunohistochemical studies in animal models have demonstrated that under pathological conditions, P2X7 receptor expression is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells and can lead to enhanced production of IL-1β when activated by extracellular ATP (Arulkumaran, 2016; Howarth, 2020). Therefore, BBG is expected to be especially effective in cell types that are critical in the development of inflammation and fibrosis in CKD. By reducing the number of inflammatory cells (such as CD68-positive macrophages) infiltrating the renal parenchyma and by limiting cell death via pyroptosis, BBG may also indirectly reduce the fibrotic signaling that is mediated by cytokines such as TGF-β. This dual effect—both direct inhibition of inflammatory signaling and preservation of renal cell integrity—provides a compelling rationale for BBG’s use in preventing the progression of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020).

Moreover, BBG’s known safety profile in central nervous system studies and its extensive use as a surgical dye underscore its translational potential. Its water solubility and known pharmacokinetics facilitate dosing strategies that could be adapted for chronic administration in CKD patients. Additionally, the indirect suppression of inflammasome activation through P2X7 antagonism presents a novel approach to modulating the inflammatory microenvironment in the kidney, one that targets a critical nexus of inflammation and fibrosis (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, BBG presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on its ability to noncompetitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor, thereby blocking ATP-induced inflammasome priming and activation. The strengths of BBG include its well-established safety profile, water solubility, and proven efficacy in various rodent models of kidney injury such as hypertensive nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction. Preclinical data indicate that BBG can reduce key mediators of inflammation such as IL-1β, lower caspase-1 activation, and mitigate the deleterious effects of pyroptosis on renal tubular architecture, all of which are central to the pathophysiology of CKD (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).

However, several challenges remain that warrant further investigation. There is limited direct clinical data specifically evaluating BBG in human CKD patients, although the identification of related clinical trials targeting P2X7 and NLRP3 receptors in CKD suggests active interest in this therapeutic approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while BBG’s mechanism of action is well supported by in vitro and animal studies, the potential for differential effects based on receptor splice variants and cell type specificity in renal tissue must be carefully delineated. For instance, recent studies indicate that variations in P2X7 receptor expression and function in the renal vasculature may impact not only inflammatory signaling but also vascular tone, which could influence overall renal perfusion and function (Howarth, 2020).

Moreover, while BBG’s indirect inhibition of the inflammasome pathway via P2X7 antagonism is mechanistically attractive, redundancy in inflammasome activation pathways—such as those that are P2X7-independent—might limit the overall efficacy of BBG as a monotherapy. Some studies have demonstrated that even with effective P2X7 inhibition, alternative pathways may still sustain IL-1β release under inflammatory conditions (Arulkumaran, 2016; Prendecki et al., 2022). Therefore, combination therapies that target multiple nodes in the inflammasome network may ultimately be required to achieve robust clinical benefit.

In terms of drug development strategies, BBG benefits from its established manufacturing and dosing data, which accelerates early phase clinical trial design and regulatory considerations. In addition, BBG has been successfully used in non-renal contexts—including long-term treatments in models of graft-versus-host disease—without significant toxicity, lending further support to its translational potential (Geraghty et al., 2019). The extensive literature on BBG’s anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in preclinical models provides a solid rationale for advancing this candidate for CKD even as further mechanistic and pharmacodynamic studies are conducted.

Weaknesses of this candidate include the fact that while much of the preclinical data is encouraging, there is still a need for robust clinical trials that specifically assess BBG in CKD. Additionally, given the complexity of CKD pathogenesis—which involves multiple overlapping inflammatory and fibrotic signaling mechanisms—it will be important to determine whether BBG alone can induce sufficient therapeutic benefit or whether it is best applied as part of a combination regimen. Moreover, the potential vascular effects of P2X7 antagonism require further clarification to ensure that systemic hemodynamics are not adversely affected, particularly in patients with existing cardiovascular complications that often accompany CKD (Howarth, 2020).

Overall, the mechanistic rationale for BBG centers on its ability to interfere with a critical inflammatory pathway—namely, the ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. This blockade not only reduces the activation of caspase-1 and the release of IL-1β but also limits pyroptotic cell death, preservation of tubular architecture, and ultimately, fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. These effects address key pathogenic mechanisms underlying CKD progression. Moreover, aspects such as its water solubility, known dosing regimens from CNS and surgical applications, and favorable preclinical safety record render BBG an attractive candidate for fast-tracked repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Ferreira et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2020).

In conclusion, the evidence reviewed indicates that Brilliant Blue G holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. Its mechanism—centered on noncompetitive antagonism of the P2X7 receptor and consequent suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade—offers a novel approach to preserving renal function by reducing inflammatory injury and fibrosis. While further research, particularly targeted clinical trials in the CKD patient population, is necessary to fully validate its efficacy and safety in this context, the preclinical data and extensive understanding of its molecular interactions support the continued development of BBG for CKD therapy (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).

"Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)","Proposal for Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Disulfiram is a synthetic small‐molecule drug originally discovered more than seventy years ago and is well known for its unique chemical structure featuring a tetraethylthiuram disulfide core. It is typically synthesized via the oxidation of diethyldithiocarbamate salts derived from the reaction of carbon disulfide with diethylamine, producing a compound with a central disulfide bond that confers its thiol‐reactive properties (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13). Chemically, disulfiram belongs to the dithiocarbamate family and is classified pharmacologically as an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor. Historically, this inhibition of ALDH has been the molecular basis for its clinical application as an alcohol aversion agent, where disulfiram induces the accumulation of acetaldehyde following alcohol ingestion, causing an assortment of discomforting physiological effects such as flushing, nausea, and tachycardia (Lu et al., 2021, p. 12). More recently, however, disulfiram has assumed a new identity in drug repurposing initiatives; its ability to interact covalently with cysteine residues in target proteins – a consequence of its thiuram disulfide structure – has attracted considerable attention in the context of inflammatory diseases. In particular, its capacity to interfere with the function of gasdermin D (GSDMD) via covalent modification is emerging as a promising mechanism by which disulfiram could counteract pathological inflammatory pathways (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4). This newly recognized activity places disulfiram within a therapeutic class of established drugs that are being re‐evaluated beyond their original indications, seeking to exploit their long clinical history and known safety profiles for novel applications such as the modulation of pyroptosis in inflammatory pathologies like chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Therapeutic History:
Disulfiram has a long-established history, primarily being used in the management of chronic alcohol use disorder since its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the early 1950s. As a stand‐alone therapy, its effectiveness in producing a pronounced aversive reaction to ethanol intake has made it a mainstay in addiction medicine. Over the decades, disulfiram has been administered safely to vast numbers of patients – a fact that is of critical importance when considering repurposing efforts, as its pharmacokinetics, dosing parameters, and toxicity profiles are well documented (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3). In addition to its established role in alcohol abstinence, disulfiram has been repurposed for a number of other applications. Emerging investigations have highlighted its promising activity in malignancies, where disulfiram, often in conjunction with supplemental copper, has demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against cancer stem cells via mechanisms that involve proteasome inhibition and modulation of redox homeostasis (Lu et al., 2021, pp. 13–14; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). More recently, its anti-inflammatory potential has been explored in the context of infectious diseases and systemic inflammatory responses. For instance, disulfiram has been evaluated in sepsis models, where its inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis led to reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines and improved survival in animal models (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). In models of ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), disulfiram pretreatment was shown to ameliorate renal dysfunction and histological damage by suppressing the noncanonical caspase-11–GSDMD inflammatory axis (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6). Although direct clinical studies of disulfiram in chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis remain limited, the encouraging preclinical signals from acute kidney insults and its capacity to modulate cell death pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation suggest that disulfiram—and its metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate—might be effective in attenuating the injurious inflammatory cascades observed in CKD.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, the repurposing hypothesis for disulfiram in chronic kidney disease centers on its recently identified inhibitory effect on gasdermin D (GSDMD), a pore-forming effector protein that is indispensable for the execution of pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory, lytic form of programmed cell death triggered by the activation of inflammasomes. When these multiprotein complexes form in response to pathogenic stimuli or sterile injury, they lead to the activation of inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1, and in noncanonical pathways, caspase-4/5/11. These enzymes cleave GSDMD to generate an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) that oligomerizes and inserts into the plasma membrane to form pores, thereby releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) into the extracellular milieu (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17). Disulfiram has been shown to block this crucial terminal step in pyroptosis by covalently modifying a conserved cysteine residue (Cys191 in human GSDMD and Cys192 in murine GSDMD) through a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. This chemical modification prevents the oligomerization and subsequent membrane pore formation by GSDMD, thereby directly inhibiting the execution phase of pyroptosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). Moreover, disulfiram’s activity is potentiated in the presence of copper ions, which may stabilize its reactive metabolites such as diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC), enhancing its inhibitory potency in cellular assays (Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18). The outcome of this inhibition is a significant reduction in the pyroptotic cell death cascade, as evidenced by decreased IL-1β release and overall attenuation of inflammatory signaling. In the context of the kidney, specifically within tubular epithelial cells (TECs), the inflammatory microenvironment driven by inflammasome activation is one of the critical factors in the progression from acute injury to chronic fibrosis. TECs are known to express inflammasome components and are susceptible to pyroptosis, which contributes to interstitial inflammation and fibrogenesis (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Therefore, by inhibiting the cleavage and activation of GSDMD in these cells, disulfiram has the potential to preserve tubular integrity and prevent the inflammatory cascade that ultimately drives chronic kidney injury.

Expected Effect:
Based on the proposed hypothesis and data from related inflammatory and renal injury models, disulfiram is predicted to exert a protective effect in the setting of chronic kidney disease by targeting the final common pathway of pyroptotic cell death. In a typical in vitro assay using primary tubular epithelial cells or established TEC lines, treatment with disulfiram at concentrations within the non-cytotoxic range (e.g., 0.1–5 µM as indicated in hypoxia/reoxygenation models) is expected to prevent the formation of GSDMD pores, thereby reducing cell membrane disruption, limiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18), and preserving cell viability (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11). The expected molecular signature following disulfiram treatment would include decreased levels of cleaved (active) GSDMD, reduced caspase-11 activation along with lower concentrations of circulating cytokines, as well as preserved markers of epithelial cell integrity. Given that GSDMD and components of the inflammasome are expressed in tubular epithelial cells (as supported by studies focusing on renal inflammatory pathways; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 7–9; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 9–10), the inhibition of GSDMD pore formation directly addresses a mechanistic driver of tubular injury. This would translate into reduced interstitial inflammation and limited myofibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition, which are critical steps in the fibrotic process that underpins CKD progression (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Ultimately, the expectation is that a therapeutic regimen involving disulfiram may slow or even halt the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease by mitigating the damaging effects of pyroptosis.

Overall Evaluation:
Disulfiram presents several attractive features as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. The strengths of disulfiram include:
1. A well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profile, supported by decades of clinical use in alcohol aversion therapy, which facilitates rapid translation into new clinical contexts (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Lu et al., 2021, p. 12).
2. A clear and innovative mechanism of action based on the inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis. This mechanism is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of CKD, where inflammasome activation and resultant pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells contribute to interstitial inflammation and fibrosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11).
3. The potential for its active metabolite, diethyldithiocarbamate, and the enhancing role of copper complexation to improve its potency as a pyroptosis inhibitor further bolster the therapeutic rationale (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18; Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34).
4. Preclinical evidence in models of acute kidney injury (ischemia-reperfusion injury) demonstrates that disulfiram can ameliorate renal dysfunction through inhibition of the caspase-11–GSDMD axis, suggesting that similar effects may be achieved in chronic inflammatory settings underlying CKD (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11).

However, there are also potential weaknesses and gaps that warrant further exploration:
1. Despite promising preclinical data in acute injury models and other inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, direct evidence of disulfiram’s efficacy in chronic kidney disease models remains limited. The available studies do not present long-term data specific to CKD or renal fibrosis, which is critical for validating its use in a chronic condition (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6).
2. While the mechanism of covalent modification of GSDMD at Cys191 is well supported by molecular studies, the extrapolation of these findings to tubular epithelial cells in the kidney (as opposed to macrophages or other inflammatory cells) requires additional confirmation. It is essential to verify that TECs exhibit similar susceptibility to the gasdermin D inhibitory effects of disulfiram under pathological conditions (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).
3. Dosage optimization, chronic toxicity assessments, and potential off-target effects in the renal context have not yet been extensively characterized. Although the historical human use of disulfiram supports a favorable safety profile, the dosing regimen for CKD might differ from that used for alcohol aversion therapy, given the distinct pharmacodynamics required to inhibit pyroptosis in kidney tissues (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8).
4. Another consideration is the effect of systemic modulation of pyroptosis. Since pyroptosis is integral to effective immune responses under certain circumstances, indiscriminate long-term inhibition could potentially compromise host defenses against infections. This balance between therapeutic efficacy in CKD and preservation of necessary immune functions must be carefully evaluated in preclinical models and eventually in clinical trials (Hu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).

In summary, disulfiram emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease due to its novel mechanism of targeting gasdermin D-induced pyroptosis—a pathway that is increasingly recognized as a critical driver of renal inflammation and fibrogenesis. Its long clinical history, established oral bioavailability, and well-characterized safety profile offer substantial advantages that could accelerate its translation into CKD-focused studies. The evidence from acute kidney injury models and inflammatory disease research forms a strong mechanistic rationale for its use to preserve tubular epithelial integrity and mitigate interstitial inflammation. Nevertheless, further detailed studies are imperative to validate its effectiveness in chronic kidney models, delineate optimal dosing strategies, and ensure that the inhibition of pyroptosis does not adversely affect normal immune surveillance. Based on the data reviewed—from biochemical studies demonstrating covalent modification of GSDMD (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8) to preclinical studies in renal injury models (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6)—the overall evaluation supports continued investigation of disulfiram as a repurposed agent in CKD. Its potential to modulate a critical pathogenic pathway in chronic kidney injury could represent a novel therapeutic intervention that merits further preclinical and clinical development (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18).

"CY-09 (Selleckchem, catalog #S8614)","Proposal for CY-09 (Selleckchem, catalog #S8614)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
CY-09 is a synthetic, small-molecule inhibitor discovered through a focused drug development campaign that initially screened analogs of CFTR inhibitors (specifically C172) and later optimized them to generate compounds with potent and selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Chemically, CY-09 belongs to the class of thiazolidinone derivatives, a category known for its capacity to interfere with enzymatic activities via covalent or non-covalent interactions. Its development was driven by the need to specifically target the ATP-binding site within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, particularly focusing on the Walker A motif—a conserved nucleotide-binding region that is essential for the ATPase activity required for NLRP3 oligomerization. The design rationale behind CY-09 was based on structure-based drug design principles, where the compound was engineered to directly bind NLRP3, thereby preventing the conformational changes necessary for inflammasome assembly. This chemical class has previously been used in various contexts to modulate protein–enzyme interactions, and its application in inflammasome biology represents an evolution of this approach to target excessive inflammation mediated by the innate immune system (Jiang et al., 2017; Bertinaria et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of CY-09 is rooted in preclinical studies where it has been extensively characterized in vitro and in animal models of inflammatory diseases. Initially, CY-09 demonstrated potent inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in murine bone marrow–derived macrophages stimulated with canonical activators such as ATP, nigericin, and monosodium urate crystals, showing a dose-dependent reduction in IL-1β secretion and caspase-1 activation. Its efficacy has been documented in rodent models of sepsis and colitis, as well as in metabolic disorder models where NLRP3-driven inflammation is a core pathological feature. Although no clinical trials having been completed in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) specifically have been reported to date, the compound’s inclusion in multiple clinical trial searches (ClinicalTrials.gov) indicates that there is active interest in repurposing or further evaluating NLRP3 inhibitors like CY-09 in kidney-related conditions. Furthermore, the extensive body of work demonstrating that NLRP3 knockout or pharmacological inhibition confers protection against renal fibrosis, tubular inflammation, and other hallmarks of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Zhou & Li, 2023) supports the translational potential of a molecule such as CY-09. Historically, similar NLRP3 inhibitors (for example, MCC950) have been applied in various preclinical models of inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and their protective effects in conditions like diabetic nephropathy and ischemia-reperfusion injury provide a strong rationale for applying CY-09 in CKD (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
CY-09 exerts its therapeutic action by directly binding to the NLRP3 protein at its NACHT domain, specifically targeting the Walker A (or P-loop) motif responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis. This binding event competitively inhibits ATP from accessing the site, thereby blocking the ATPase activity essential for NLRP3 oligomerization. Without ATP hydrolysis, NLRP3 is unable to undergo the conformational rearrangements necessary for the aggregation of multiple NLRP3 molecules into the inflammasome complex. Consequently, the formation of the adaptor protein ASC specks is prevented, leading to a blockade of pro-caspase-1 activation and subsequent cleavage into its active form. This chain of events ultimately results in a reduction of the maturation and secretion of the central proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and it halts gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis—a form of lytic, inflammatory cell death that substantially contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis in CKD. Importantly, studies have demonstrated that CY-09 does not interfere with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, underscoring its molecular specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2019). The molecular interaction of CY-09 is supported by biotinylated pull-down assays which confirm its selective binding to NLRP3 over other inflammasome components, and computational docking models corroborate a binding mode that is competitive with ATP at the Walker A motif (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017). This detailed molecular mechanism signifies that CY-09 operates at an early and critical step in the inflammasome pathway, making it a highly attractive candidate for diseases with a significant inflammatory component, such as CKD (Zhou & Li, 2023).

Expected Effect:
The proposed hypothesis for applying CY-09 to CKD is that by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in human proximal tubular epithelial cells, the compound will inhibit ATPase-driven oligomerization of NLRP3, thereby reducing the formation of ASC specks, the activation of caspase-1, and the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. The downstream effect of blocking these events is the inhibition of gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis, which is known to drive tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrotic remodeling—a central hallmark in the progression of CKD. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, NLRP3 is expressed and activated in response to various stress stimuli, including oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and metabolic dysregulation, all of which are common in CKD pathogenesis. By impeding this pathway, CY-09 is expected to diminish inflammatory cytokine secretion and reduce cell death, thereby preserving tubular integrity, minimizing interstitial inflammation, and preventing the fibrotic changes that culminate in renal function decline (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Data from preclinical models of kidney injury, such as those using MCC950 and other NLRP3 knockout models, have consistently shown improvements in renal structure and function, and reduction in profibrotic markers upon inhibition of the NLRP3 pathway (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017). Furthermore, oral bioavailability and a favorable safety profile in rodent studies enhance the clinical feasibility of CY-09 as a repurposed agent for CKD (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The expected effects in a CKD model would therefore include reduced extracellular matrix deposition, lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the renal interstitium, and overall attenuation of the fibrotic process, translating ultimately into stabilization of renal function (Zhou & Li, 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on the comprehensive literature review, CY-09 emerges as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease. One of its greatest strengths lies in its robust and specific mechanism of action; by directly binding to the Walker A motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3, CY-09 efficiently prevents the initial ATP-driven steps that are critical for inflammasome assembly. This targeted inhibition ensures that downstream activation events—namely ASC speck formation, caspase-1 activation, and subsequent IL-1β/IL-18 maturation—are effectively suppressed. Such specificity is critical for minimizing off-target effects, as CY-09 has shown no significant interference with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, which could reduce undesirable immunosuppressive side effects (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The repurposing strategy is further supported by extensive preclinical evidence indicating that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 results in marked protection against renal fibrosis and inflammation in various CKD models. The preclinical efficacy of similar NLRP3 inhibitors such as MCC950 in models of diabetic nephropathy, cisplatin-induced renal injury, and ischemia-reperfusion injury reinforces the therapeutic potential of targeting NLRP3 in kidney disease (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017).

Another significant strength of CY-09 is its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile in rodent studies, which is an important consideration for chronic administration required in CKD therapy (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). This pharmacokinetic profile, along with the compound’s high potency in inflammatory assays where nanomolar inhibitory effects have been observed, provides confidence that CY-09 could achieve therapeutically effective concentrations in the kidney without systemic toxicity.

However, there are also challenges and uncertainties. Although extensive preclinical studies in inflammatory disease models support the potential of CY-09, direct evidence of its efficacy in chronic kidney disease models specifically remains limited. The majority of studies to date have focused on sepsis, metabolic disorders, and murine colitis rather than on kidney-specific outcomes. There is, therefore, a need for more targeted preclinical research in CKD models—including those mimicking diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and cisplatin-induced renal fibrosis—to definitively establish the renoprotective effects of CY-09 (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Additionally, while the mechanism is well-characterized in immune cells like macrophages, further studies need to elucidate its effects specifically in human proximal tubular epithelial cells and other renal cell types that contribute to CKD progression. Such studies should evaluate not only biochemical markers of inflammasome activation but also functional outcomes like proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate, and histological indices of fibrosis.

Another potential weakness concerns the translational gap between rodent models and human CKD. The pathophysiology of CKD is multifactorial, and while NLRP3-mediated inflammation is a key driver, the disease process involves many convergent signaling pathways including TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling and oxidative stress pathways. It is possible that the blockade of NLRP3 alone may not be sufficient to fully arrest disease progression in humans. In addition, although CY-09 appears selective based on current evidence, there is always the risk of off-target effects when a compound modulates ATPase activity, given the abundance of ATP-binding proteins in the cell. Careful profiling of CY-09 against a broad spectrum of other ATPases and kinases will be necessary to confirm its selectivity in a clinical setting (Sandall et al., 2020).

In summary, CY-09 represents an innovative and mechanistically compelling therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease due to its direct inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a central mediator of renal inflammation and fibrosis. Its synthesis as a thiazolidinone derivative and its proven ability to bind the Walker A motif within the NACHT domain underscore its potential to precisely block inflammasome-driven pyroptosis. Preclinical evidence from models of various inflammatory conditions, along with robust biochemical data demonstrating nanomolar potency in macrophage assays, provides a strong rationale for its repurposing in kidney disease. Furthermore, its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety in rodent studies enhance its translational appeal. Nonetheless, additional research is needed to specifically validate its efficacy in CKD models, assess its long-term safety, and determine its pharmacodynamic effects in kidney-specific cell types such as proximal tubular epithelial cells. Overall, the strengths of CY-09’s targeted mechanism, coupled with supportive preclinical efficacy data from related inflammatory models, make it a promising candidate for further development and evaluation in Chronic Kidney Disease (ClinicalTrials.gov; Jiang et al., 2017; Zhou & Li, 2023).

"A-438079 (Tocris, catalog #2947)","Proposal for A-438079 (Tocris, catalog #2947)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
A-438079 is a synthetic small‐molecule antagonist originally developed as a selective inhibitor of the P2X7 receptor, a ligand‐gated ion channel known to be activated by high concentrations of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The compound belongs to a class of agents that includes disubstituted tetrazoles and cyanoguanidine derivatives, which have been characterized by their ability to selectively block P2X7 receptor activation without significantly affecting other P2X subtypes. Its design and synthesis were initially achieved by pharmaceutical research groups (notably Abbott Laboratories as indicated in early publications) and have since been commercialized by companies such as Tocris (catalog #2947). This class of compounds was originally optimized for studies in inflammatory processes and pain models, as they inhibit ATP‐induced ion flux such as calcium influx and potassium efflux, a key factor in the activation cascade of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).

Therapeutic History:
Biochemically and pharmacologically, A-438079 has been investigated in various preclinical models for its ability to mitigate inflammation. It has demonstrated efficacy in rodent models of neuropathic pain and inflammatory conditions by inhibiting P2X7-mediated IL-1β release. In terms of renal applications, there is evidence from several studies that selective P2X7 antagonism can protect against kidney insults such as ischemia-reperfusion injury and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. For example, Zhang et al. (2014) showed that blocking P2X7 with antagonists like A-438079 attenuated cisplatin-induced renal tubular damage by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis markers in mice (Zhang et al., 2014). Additionally, studies such as those by Arulkumaran (2016) and colleagues have demonstrated that while genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of P2X7 in some models does not always equate to improved renal function, the block of P2X7-related signaling reduces inflammasome activation and cytokine release in immune cells and tubular epithelium (Arulkumaran, 2016; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Even though A-438079 has not been widely tested clinically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), its pharmacological profile as a P2X7 antagonist has been well characterized in biochemical studies and preclinical kidney injury models. This builds an indirect but strong rationale for repurposing it in CKD contexts, where sustained inflammation and fibrosis are major pathogenic drivers (Birch et al., 2013; Fantauzzi, 2013).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of A-438079 is its high-affinity, selective antagonism of the P2X7 receptor. The P2X7 receptor is unique among the P2X family in its requirement for high concentrations of ATP, which are typically achieved in pathological conditions involving cell injury and inflammation. Under normal conditions, extracellular ATP levels are low; however, during tissue damage, ATP is released into the extracellular space where it binds to and activates P2X7 receptors expressed on immune cells (especially macrophages) and renal tubular epithelial cells (Han et al., 2020; Howarth, 2020).

Upon binding of ATP to the receptor, P2X7 undergoes a conformational change that opens its ion channel, permitting the influx of calcium ions and the efflux of potassium ions. This potassium efflux is a critical upstream event that triggers the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex responsible for activating caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 then cleaves the precursors of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature, secreted forms. These cytokines play major roles in propagating inflammatory signals, inducing pyroptosis (a form of inflammatory cell death), and promoting fibrotic remodeling in affected tissues (Qian et al., 2021; Shokoples, 2022).

A-438079 interacts with the P2X7 receptor by competitively inhibiting ATP binding, thereby preventing the channel’s conformational change and subsequent ion flux. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) is approximately 40 nM in rodent models, indicating high potency (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). By blocking this pathway, A-438079 inhibits downstream events including NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 cleavage, and the release of IL-1β, ultimately reducing inflammatory responses and preventing the activation of fibrotic signaling pathways in kidney tissue, particularly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells where P2X7 and NLRP3 are highly expressed (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).

Expected Effect:
In the context of chronic kidney disease, the principal pathological mechanisms include persistent inflammation and fibrosis, processes that are significantly driven by inflammasome activation in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. The hypothesis postulates that A-438079 will block ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor in these cell types. By doing so, it prevents the crucial potassium efflux that is necessary for the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The expected downstream effects include a reduction in caspase-1 activation, decreased cleavage of pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β, and ultimately lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This chain of events is anticipated to reduce pyroptosis and curb the progression of fibrosis within the kidney (Qian et al., 2021; Arulkumaran et al., 2018).

Renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells are known to express both the P2X7 receptor and NLRP3, as evidenced by various studies outlining their roles in mediating inflammation-driven fibrosis in CKD (Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020). In assays, it is expected that treatment with A-438079 would result in a measurable decrease in IL-1β release, reduced markers of inflammation such as caspase-1 activity, and potentially lower expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components. Furthermore, by blunting chronic inflammatory responses, A-438079 may help to preserve kidney structure and function, thereby slowing the progression of CKD. The compound’s favorable pharmacokinetic properties—particularly its demonstrated bioavailability and minimal off-target effects—support the feasibility of achieving these outcomes (Burnstock, 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
A-438079 presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on several factors. One of its major strengths lies in its selectivity and potency as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, which allows it to precisely target an upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that is centrally implicated in CKD. The ability of A-438079 to block ATP-induced ion flux is particularly compelling because it interrupts the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a known driver of IL-1β and IL-18 release in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells (Arulkumaran, 2016; Qian et al., 2021). This molecular specificity holds promise for reducing inflammation and subsequent fibrotic formation in the kidney, both of which are critical elements in CKD progression.

The preclinical evidence supporting the use of P2X7 antagonists in models of acute kidney injury, such as cisplatin nephrotoxicity and sepsis-induced renal injury, provides additional rationale, even though such models are not perfect surrogates for CKD (Zhang et al., 2014; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Some studies have demonstrated that selective P2X7 blockade can attenuate inflammatory cytokine production, improve renal function markers, and reduce cell death, thereby supporting the hypothesis that similar benefits could be realized in chronic inflammatory settings like CKD (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).

Additionally, the mechanistic details of P2X7 receptor signaling – requiring high extracellular ATP concentrations, initiating K+ efflux, and triggering inflammasome assembly – align closely with the known processes of renal inflammation and fibrosis. The fact that P2X7 and NLRP3 are co-expressed in key renal cell populations reinforces the logic behind using A-438079 to target these pathways (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).

However, there are some weaknesses and potential challenges that need to be considered. Firstly, in some preclinical models, especially in certain rat strains (as noted by studies involving P2X7 receptor knockout rats), the inhibition or deletion of P2X7 did not significantly alter renal function or prevent kidney injury induced by hypertensive factors such as angiotensin II (Nespoux et al., 2024). This suggests that compensatory pathways may exist, and the role of P2X7 might be context-dependent or vary among species. Secondly, clinical trials of P2X7 antagonists in other inflammatory diseases have had mixed outcomes, raising concerns about translational efficacy in human CKD (Luz et al., 2019). Moreover, while the mechanism of inflammasome inhibition is well understood in vitro, the in vivo pharmacodynamics in the kidney may be complicated by variable local ATP concentrations and the dynamic expression of the receptor in disease states.

From a drug development standpoint, the potency (IC50 ~40 nM) and reported good bioavailability of A-438079 are advantageous. Its minimal off-target effects also reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions in clinical translation. However, more robust and specific data in CKD models are necessary to establish whether the attenuation of IL-1β release can consistently translate into meaningful improvements in renal fibrosis and overall kidney function over long-term treatment courses (Chen et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2024).

In summary, A-438079’s targeted inhibition of the P2X7 receptor offers a novel approach to halt the ATP-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby mitigating a key upstream trigger of inflammatory cascades in CKD. Its preclinical track record in inflammatory and renal injury models, combined with its mechanistic specificity, positions it as a strong candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease. Nonetheless, species variability, redundant inflammatory pathways, and the need for further in vivo validation in models of long-term kidney disease remain potential hurdles. If these challenges are addressed in further preclinical and early clinical studies, A-438079 could represent a significant advance in targeting the inflammation-fibrosis axis in CKD (Arulkumaran et al., 2018; Fantauzzi, 2013; Howarth, 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
The strengths of A-438079 for CKD include its high potency, selectivity, and well-elucidated mechanism of action in blocking ATP-induced P2X7 receptor activation—a critical initiator of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. These molecular interactions have been robustly characterized in multiple preclinical studies, indicating that the drug may effectively reduce IL-1β-mediated inflammation and subsequent fibrotic responses. In models of acute renal injury, antagonizing P2X7 has led to reduced cell death and improved renal function, which supports its potential usage in CKD where chronic inflammation is a driver of progressive fibrosis. Moreover, the chemical class to which A-438079 belongs has been extensively employed in studies of inflammatory diseases, reinforcing the feasibility of this approach (Deplano, 2012; Qian et al., 2021).

Conversely, potential weaknesses lie in the heterogeneity of experimental outcomes across different preclinical models and species. Some studies have shown that genetic deletion of P2X7 in rats does not always confer renal protection in induced kidney injury, suggesting that the pathophysiology in certain species—or even specific CKD etiologies—may be driven by redundant pathways beyond P2X7/NLRP3. In addition, although A-438079 demonstrates promising in vitro efficacy, there remains a critical need for long-term in vivo studies specifically in CKD models to verify that its anti-inflammatory effects translate into clinically meaningful outcomes in terms of preservation of renal function and reduction in fibrosis. Lastly, it is important to consider potential compensatory mechanisms in chronic inflammation that may limit the sole efficacy of P2X7 inhibition (Nespoux et al., 2024; Luz et al., 2019).

In conclusion, A-438079 is a scientifically compelling therapeutic candidate for CKD, with robust mechanistic support and significant preclinical evidence in inflammatory models. Its ability to target the P2X7/NLRP3 axis addresses a novel therapeutic area in CKD by potentially halting the progression of inflammation-driven fibrosis. However, potential limitations due to species-specific responses and redundancy in inflammatory signaling must be carefully evaluated in future studies. Overall, A-438079 merits further investigation as part of a multi-pronged approach to modulate inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in chronic kidney disease (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020).

"Oridonin (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #O2015)","Proposal for Oridonin (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #O2015)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Oridonin is a naturally occurring diterpenoid compound isolated primarily from Rabdosia rubescens, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb that has been used for centuries to treat inflammatory conditions and cancers. As a kaurane-type diterpenoid, its structure comprises four isoprene units arranged into a characteristic tetracyclic skeleton, which is emblematic of this class of natural products. The compound’s discovery and development emerged from the long-standing tradition of using Rabdosia rubescens (also known as Donglingcao) in Asian folk medicine, where it was historically applied for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In the broader context of drug development, diterpenoids such as oridonin have been recognized for their “drug-like” properties; they have provided scaffolds for synthetic modifications aimed at improving potency, solubility, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Moreover, the extraction and study of oridonin reflect an important paradigm in natural products research, wherein historical use is validated and expanded upon with modern medicinal chemistry techniques. This compound, commercially available from suppliers like Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #O2015), fits well within the class of small-molecule natural products that have been repurposed for modern therapeutic applications in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases (Ding et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Oridonin’s use spans a broad spectrum of therapeutic applications. Traditionally, the herbal preparations containing oridonin were employed in Chinese medicine to alleviate conditions ranging from pharyngitis and gingivitis to various inflammatory and tumorous conditions. With the advent of modern biochemical and pharmacological research, oridonin has been extensively studied for its anticancer efficacy; many preclinical studies have demonstrated its capacity to induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and suppress metastasis in a variety of cancer cell lines (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In addition to its anticancer properties, several studies have documented oridonin’s robust anti-inflammatory actions. Notably, oridonin has shown efficacy in experimental models of colitis and gout through its inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that mediates the maturation of IL-1β and is a critical driver of inflammatory responses (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020). Although most of the historical and ongoing research has emphasized oridonin’s anticancer and acute inflammatory indications, there is emerging interest in its potential role in renal pathologies. A search on ClinicalTrials.gov using terms such as “Oridonin AND kidney OR renal OR chronic kidney disease OR glomerulonephritis OR proteinuria OR glomerular” returned tens of thousands of trials, indicating significant research activity into natural products and potentially repurposed compounds for kidney diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, to date there is limited direct clinical evidence of oridonin being deployed specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preclinical studies, particularly those involving rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and ischemia–reperfusion injury, have demonstrated renoprotective effects such as reduced inflammatory cytokine levels, diminished fibrosis markers, and improved renal function parameters; these effects suggest that oridonin or its derivatives might be promising candidates for treating CKD or similar renal conditions (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, oridonin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects primarily through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex known to activate caspase-1 and mediate the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. Recent mechanistic studies have shown that oridonin covalently binds to cysteine 279 within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, a critical residue required for the ATPase activity of NLRP3 and its subsequent oligomerization (He et al., 2018). This binding effectively prevents the conformational changes necessary for the recruitment of NEK7, thereby halting inflammasome assembly and activation. In macrophages, this inhibition leads to a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and attenuates inflammatory cell recruitment—a mechanism that has been validated through pull‐down assays and mass spectrometry, which demonstrated nanomolar potency of oridonin in suppressing NLRP3 activation (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020).

Beyond its direct interaction with the NLRP3 inflammasome, oridonin has been shown to modulate additional signaling pathways. For example, it can inhibit NF-κB and p38-MAPK activation, further blunting the inflammatory response, and it has been implicated in the activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidative defenses at lower concentrations, contributing to its cytoprotective effects (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019). These multifaceted actions underscore the polypharmacological nature of oridonin: while its primary mode of action appears to involve covalent modification of NLRP3, its downstream effects extend into a broader anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative network. This convergence on inflammatory signaling pathways is particularly relevant because overactivation of the inflammasome and subsequent pyroptotic cell death are implicated not only in acute inflammatory diseases but also in chronic fibrotic processes within the kidney (Ding et al., 2020).

Expanding the context to renal pathology, the hypothesis driving our proposal is that human podocytes—which are essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier—express components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of NLRP3 in these cells has been linked to pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, which in turn contributes to podocyte loss, proteinuria, and interstitial fibrosis, all hallmarks of CKD. Although most direct evidence of oridonin’s NLRP3 inhibition comes from studies in immune cells like macrophages (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2016), the underlying mechanism is conserved across cell types. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that oridonin could similarly inhibit NLRP3 activation in podocytes, thereby preventing inflammasome assembly, blocking caspase-1 activation, and ultimately reducing the release of IL-1β (Li et al., 2021). By precluding these downstream events, oridonin may attenuate the cycle of inflammatory damage and fibrosis that underpins progressive renal injury in CKD (Li et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assays and eventual in vivo models of chronic kidney disease, the expected effect of oridonin centers on its ability to protect podocytes from NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated injury. More specifically, by covalently binding to cysteine 279 in NLRP3, oridonin is anticipated to inhibit ATP hydrolysis and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex. This mechanistic blockade should result in a reduction of caspase-1 activation—a key step in the maturation of IL-1β—and thereby diminish the secretion of this potent pro-inflammatory cytokine (He et al., 2018). In podocytes, such suppression is expected to reduce pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death that directly compromises the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and leads to proteinuria. Preservation of podocyte viability would, in turn, help maintain glomerular barrier integrity, minimizing the leakage of plasma proteins into the urine and limiting the ensuing fibrotic response in the renal interstitium (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).

Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB and p38-MAPK signaling pathways could provide additional benefits by reducing overall renal inflammation. In animal models of kidney injury—such as those induced by ischemia–reperfusion or diabetic nephropathy—treatment with compounds that inhibit these pathways has been correlated with improved renal function parameters (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021). Therefore, beyond its direct effect on podocyte inflammasome activity, oridonin may exert broader renoprotective actions by dampening inflammatory cascades that contribute to interstitial fibrosis and progressive renal insufficiency. In this context, oridonin’s oral bioavailability and established history in traditional medicine support the feasibility of translating these preclinical findings into clinical benefit for CKD patients (Su et al., 2024).

It is important to note that while direct evidence of oridonin’s effects on human podocytes remains to be fully elucidated, the expression of NLRP3 in podocytes has been demonstrated in experimental models of CKD. Additionally, studies involving natural products that inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome—such as fucoidan in diabetic kidney disease—have provided supportive mechanistic insights, suggesting that the targeting of inflammasome activation in podocytes is a viable therapeutic strategy (Wang et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, oridonin emerges as a compelling therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease, given its well-documented mechanism of inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome and its extensive background in modulating inflammatory pathways. Its natural origin and historical use in traditional Chinese medicine provide a robust basis for its safety profile, and preclinical studies have demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, including models of colitis, gout, and even acute kidney injury (Ding et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2021). Strengths of oridonin include its specificity for NLRP3 via covalent binding to a critical cysteine residue, which has been shown to yield nanomolar potency in relevant assays (He et al., 2018). Additionally, oridonin’s ability to modulate secondary pathways (NF-κB, p38-MAPK, and Nrf2) may amplify its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective benefits, addressing multiple facets of CKD pathophysiology ranging from podocyte loss to interstitial fibrosis (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).

However, several weaknesses must also be considered. Despite promising preclinical data in other disease models, direct evidence for oridonin’s efficacy in modulating NLRP3 activation specifically in podocytes remains limited. Most mechanistic studies have been conducted in macrophages or other cell types, and while the extrapolation is reasonable given the conserved nature of inflammasome signaling, dedicated studies using human podocytes are needed to substantiate the proposed protective effects on proteinuria and interstitial fibrosis (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Furthermore, issues such as moderate potency, limited solubility, and variable bioavailability have been noted with oridonin, necessitating further formulation and structural optimization to ensure therapeutic efficacy in a clinical setting (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). These pharmacokinetic considerations are particularly critical for a chronic indication like CKD, where long-term dosing and sustained target engagement are required.

Another consideration is the translation of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects observed in acute injury models or non-renal tissue into the context of chronic kidney disease, which involves complex and multifactorial pathophysiology. Although the suppression of inflammasome-driven pyroptosis is a promising target for preventing podocyte injury, CKD progression involves additional factors such as hemodynamic stress, metabolic derangements, and immune dysregulation that may not be fully addressed by NLRP3 inhibition alone (Huang et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2020). Consequently, while the mechanistic specificity of oridonin is appealing, its efficacy in a multifaceted chronic disease state like CKD requires rigorous preclinical validation followed by carefully designed clinical trials.

In summary, oridonin holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease based on its robust anti-inflammatory mechanism, particularly its ability to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome via covalent binding to cysteine 279. The compound’s multifaceted mechanism—encompassing inhibition of caspase-1 activation, IL-1β maturation, and subsequent pyroptosis—could translate into preservation of podocyte integrity, reduction in proteinuria, and attenuation of interstitial fibrosis, all of which are critical endpoints in CKD management (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Nonetheless, challenges related to drug solubility, bioavailability, and the direct demonstration of efficacy in podocytes must be addressed. Given its strong preclinical validation in other inflammatory conditions, further targeted studies focusing on its renal effects and optimization of drug-like properties are warranted before it can be advanced as a viable treatment for CKD (Tan et al., 2021; Su et al., 2024). Overall, while there is a clear mechanistic rationale supporting the therapeutic potential of oridonin in CKD, additional studies specifically assessing its effects in relevant renal cell types and chronic disease models will be critical to fully validate its clinical utility.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
INF4E is a synthetic electrophilic small‐molecule inhibitor that was initially discovered through phenotypic screening in macrophage models testing for NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. It is an acrylate derivative belonging to a class of compounds that harness α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl (Michael acceptor) functionalities to achieve covalent, irreversible inhibition of target proteins. Its discovery emerged during screening campaigns that looked for submicromolar potency against NLRP3, with subsequent chemical optimization to balance reactivity and cytotoxicity. Specifically, INF4E (also referred to in some studies as compound 9) was identified for its ability to selectively inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation by binding covalently to the NACHT domain’s ATP‐binding site, thereby interfering with ATP hydrolysis required for the conformational changes that lead to inflammasome assembly (Cocco et al., 2017; Blevins et al., 2022). As a member of the acrylate derivatives class, similar compounds have been explored in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular disorders, where targeting NLRP3 has shown promise. Members of this chemical class have a well‐documented history of being used as selective covalent modifiers with potential in modulating inflammatory signaling cascades.

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of INF4E and its related chemical family primarily stems from preclinical studies where they have been shown to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in various models of inflammation. INF4E was originally validated in sepsis models, demonstrating efficacy in reducing systemic inflammation, and subsequent studies extended its utility to show anti‐pyroptotic effects in macrophage cell lines with submicromolar potency. Moreover, related acrylate derivatives have been explored in inflammatory bowel disease models, where modifications to reduce cytotoxicity led to the generation of analogues such as INF39. Although the preclinical literature for this class of inhibitors is robust in the context of sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, and even in models of ischemic injury in the heart, there is no direct literature evidence that INF4E has been specifically used for treating chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis. Searches in Clinical Trials databases for “NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have revealed only nascent clinical exploration of NLRP3 inhibitors in renal disease, with most candidates like MCC950 and OLT1177 being at early development stages (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023). Thus, while INF4E’s mechanism of NLRP3 inhibition is highly relevant to inflammatory processes, its therapeutic history in kidney disease remains limited to preclinical mechanistic rationale rather than established clinical or veterinary use in CKD.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, INF4E exerts its action by covalently binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, specifically targeting its ATP‐binding site. The NACHT domain is essential for NLRP3 oligomerization and subsequent inflammasome assembly. INF4E’s acrylate (Michael acceptor) moiety reacts with cysteine residues present in this domain, thereby irreversibly blocking ATP hydrolysis. The inhibition of ATP hydrolysis interferes directly with the required conformational changes that transform NLRP3 from an inactive to an active state capable of recruiting the adaptor protein ASC and procaspase‐1. Consequently, the subsequent cleavage of caspase‐1 is prevented, which in turn stops the maturation and release of key pro‐inflammatory cytokines, notably IL‐1β and IL‐18 (Mezzaroma et al., 2021; Cocco et al., 2017).
This covalent binding mechanism is particularly significant because it offers prolonged inhibitory effects owing to its irreversible nature. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, where hypoxia serves as a potent priming signal for inflammasome activation and contributes to chronic inflammation and fibrosis, inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E is hypothesized to prevent the cascade leading to caspase‐1 activation, thus mitigating caspase‐1–dependent pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death—and reducing the release of IL‐18 (Blevins et al., 2022; Komada & Muruve, 2019).
The biochemical interactions of INF4E align with the known structure–activity relationships of electrophilic acrylate derivatives, as these compounds are designed to target the ATPase activity of NLRP3. By interfering with this enzymatic function, INF4E halts the nucleation of the inflammasome complex, thereby curtailing downstream signaling that ultimately leads to pyroptosis and fibrogenesis. The short-lived yet potent irreversible binding is a hallmark of this class of inhibitors, which has been exploited in several preclinical studies to provide a potent blockade of inflammation (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
In the context of the proposed assay and the underlying pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease, INF4E is anticipated to exhibit a therapeutic effect by mitigating hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation in proximal tubular epithelial cells. Hypoxic conditions are known to prime and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in these cells, and this process is a major contributor to tubular cell injury, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenic signaling—all key drivers of CKD progression.
The expected outcome when applying INF4E would be a significant reduction in ATP hydrolysis that is crucial for NLRP3 activation, thereby preventing the subsequent assembly of the inflammasome complex. This inhibition should lead to a decrease in caspase‐1 activity, ultimately lowering the maturation and secretion of IL‐18 (and possibly IL‐1β). Reduced levels of IL‐18 would then limit the inflammatory and fibrogenic signaling cascades that promote the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis. In assays using hypoxic proximal tubular cells, one would therefore predict reduced markers of pyroptosis, improved cell viability, and a lower expression of fibrogenic proteins such as TGF-β and α-SMA.
There is also supportive evidence that NLRP3 is expressed in proximal tubular cells and that its activation is directly linked to inflammatory responses and fibrosis under hypoxic conditions (Ochoa et al., 2023; Komada & Muruve, 2019). The selective inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E should thus translate into improved cellular integrity and a mitigated progression of the inflammatory milieu that typifies CKD. This expected modulation of pyroptosis and fibrosis markers provides a clear biochemical rationale for using INF4E as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic therapeutic candidate in kidney disease models.

Overall Evaluation:
The analysis of INF4E as a repurposed drug candidate for chronic kidney disease presents both promising and challenging aspects. One major strength of INF4E lies in its clearly defined mechanism of action; by targeting the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and interfering with ATP hydrolysis, INF4E offers a direct method to abrogate inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. This is particularly relevant in CKD, where hypoxia-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in proximal tubular cells is a key pathological event leading to pyroptosis, inflammation, and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019).
Another strength is its proven submicromolar potency as demonstrated in phenotypic screens, along with a degree of oral bioavailability in rodent models that supports the feasibility of future in vivo investigations (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021). This potency, combined with its specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome, positions INF4E as a candidate with the potential to modulate inflammatory responses without broadly suppressing the entire immune system. Moreover, by specifically reducing IL-18 release, INF4E may offer advantages over broader anti-inflammatory approaches that risk impairing normal host defense mechanisms (Thomas et al., 2022).
A potential weakness, however, is the risk associated with irreversible covalent binding, which, while conferring prolonged effects, may also lead to off-target toxicity if the selectivity is not absolute. Some acrylate derivatives have been noted for cytotoxicity issues, and although chemical optimization—such as the development of related compounds like INF39—has been undertaken to alleviate these concerns, it remains a critical point for evaluation in renal cells that are already susceptible to injury under hypoxic conditions (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).
Furthermore, while the mechanistic rationale for targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in CKD is strong, the clinical translation of NLRP3 inhibitors has been slow. Currently, only limited clinical trial data are available for NLRP3 inhibitors in CKD, and the majority of evidence remains at the preclinical level (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023).
Another consideration is that chronic kidney disease is a multifactorial condition wherein inflammasome activation is just one of several pathogenic processes, including metabolic dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and oxidative stress. Therefore, while INF4E may effectively block one critical pathway—namely, hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation—it might need to be combined with therapies targeting other aspects of CKD pathogenesis to achieve a comprehensive therapeutic effect (Unknown Reference; Mulay, 2019).
Despite these challenges, INF4E’s selectivity for a mechanistically validated target, its oral availability, and its demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory models provide a strong rationale for further investigation. In assays designed to model hypoxic tubular injury, INF4E is expected to reduce pyroptosis and fibrogenic signaling, thereby slowing CKD progression. The drug’s success in other inflammatory contexts, such as sepsis models, lends additional weight to its potential, although caution must be exercised when extrapolating these data to the complex microenvironment of the kidney (Blevins et al., 2022; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).

Continued research should focus on dosing optimization, safety profiling in kidney-specific models, and investigation of combination strategies that target both inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in CKD (Komada & Muruve, 2019; Mulay, 2019; Pagliaro & Penna, 2023; Thomas et al., 2022).

Overall, INF4E represents a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for chronic kidney disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, which aligns well with an established pathogenic pathway in CKD—namely, hypoxia-driven NLRP3 inflammasome activation in proximal tubular cells. Its ability to block the ATPase activity of NLRP3, thereby preventing both caspase-1 activation and IL-18 release, underpins a novel strategy aimed at mitigating pyroptosis and subsequent fibrogenic signaling cascades. While challenges such as potential off-target cytotoxicity, the need for extensive in vivo validation in CKD models, and integration into a multifactorial therapeutic approach remain, the compelling preclinical data for related compounds and the rigorous mechanistic underpinnings provide a strong basis for advancing INF4E in further preclinical studies and eventual clinical trials. Continued research should include detailed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological evaluations in renal models, as well as assessments of its efficacy in reducing markers of inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrosis in hypoxic proximal tubular cells. Given the complexity of CKD, INF4E may ultimately be best suited for combination therapy alongside agents addressing complementary pathogenic mechanisms. Overall, the potential strengths of INF4E—rooted in its selective, irreversible inhibition of a well‐validated molecular target—are balanced by the need for careful evaluation of safety and clinical translatability in the setting of chronic kidney disease (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019; Thomas et al., 2022).
