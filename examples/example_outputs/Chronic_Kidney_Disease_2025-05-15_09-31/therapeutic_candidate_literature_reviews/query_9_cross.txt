Query: Cross-talk between metabolic disturbances (hyperglycemia, uremic toxins, dyslipidemia) and inflammasome activation in CKD: mechanisms by which diabetic and uremic milieu trigger NLRP3 in renal cells, and consequences for fibrosis and immune cell infiltration.

Metabolic disturbances in chronic kidney disease (CKD) – specifically hyperglycemia, uremic toxins, and dyslipidemia – converge on mechanisms of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction that trigger activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in renal cells. Hyperglycemia has been shown to activate NADPH oxidase in glomerular podocytes, resulting in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation; this oxidative stress provides the signal necessary for NF-κB activation and subsequent upregulation of inflammasome components such as NLRP3, ASC, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18) (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 15-16, kim2019theroleof pages 1-3).

In addition to hyperglycemia, uremic toxins accumulate in CKD and contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and further ROS production. These toxins act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that not only prime the inflammasome but also deliver the second activation signal required for NLRP3 complex assembly in renal tubular epithelial cells and resident macrophages (mulay2019multifactorialfunctionsof pages 1-2, kim2019theroleof pages 3-5).

Dyslipidemia exacerbates this inflammatory milieu through multiple mechanisms. It leads to abnormal lipid accumulation in renal cells, and saturated fatty acids or ceramides promote mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS generation, which in turn activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, IL-1β produced upon inflammasome activation can upregulate lipid uptake receptors such as CD36, thereby reinforcing lipid deposition and metabolic stress—a vicious cycle that contributes both to sustained inflammation and metabolic derangement (kim2019theroleof pages 5-7, plonskytoder2023innateimmunityand pages 4-5).

Once activated, the NLRP3 inflammasome initiates a cascade through caspase-1 activation that cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms. These cytokines act locally and systemically to amplify the inflammatory response, attracting additional immune cells such as macrophages and T cells into the renal interstitium. The infiltrating immune cells not only perpetuate inflammation but also contribute to a further release of cytokines and ROS, thereby creating a self-propagating inflammatory environment (diazricart2020endothelialdamageinflammation pages 5-8, kim2019theroleof pages 9-11).

Beyond cytokine production, inflammasome activation plays a crucial role in the induction of fibrotic pathways. IL-1β and IL-18 interact with transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFβ1) signaling, stimulating the formation of Smad complexes that translocate to the nucleus and induce transcription of fibrogenic markers. This cascade promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tubular epithelial cells and activates renal fibroblasts, leading to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and fibronectin (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 22-24, kim2019theroleof pages 5-7).

In the diabetic and uremic milieu, the combination of persistent oxidative stress, chronic low-grade inflammation, and direct activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome results in a vicious cycle. This cycle not only accelerates the progression of renal fibrosis but also perpetuates immune cell infiltration, further compromising renal structure and function. The infiltration of immune cells intensifies inflammatory damage, promotes additional cytokine release, and ultimately drives the progression of CKD toward end-stage renal failure (diazricart2020endothelialdamageinflammation pages 18-20, plonskytoder2023innateimmunityand pages 1-2).

In summary, the interplay between metabolic disturbances such as hyperglycemia, uremic toxins, and dyslipidemia and their ability to trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation in renal cells orchestrates a robust inflammatory and fibrotic response. This cross-talk not only leads to the release of potent inflammatory mediators that recruit immune cells but also activates fibrotic pathways via TGFβ1/Smad signaling, collectively contributing to the progressive renal injury observed in CKD (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 20-22, mulay2019multifactorialfunctionsof pages 1-2).
