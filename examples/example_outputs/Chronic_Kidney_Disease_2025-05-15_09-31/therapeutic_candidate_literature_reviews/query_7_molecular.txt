Query: Molecular mechanisms driving chronic kidney disease progression: role of tubular epithelial cell pyroptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS generation, and inflammasome activation in tubulointerstitial fibrosis and loss of renal function.

Tubular epithelial cell (TEC) pyroptosis is a highly regulated, inflammasome-mediated form of programmed necrotic cell death that plays a central role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression by fueling persistent inflammation and subsequent fibrotic remodeling of the renal interstitium (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 2-3). In TECs, inflammasome activation occurs when pattern recognition receptors, particularly NLRP3, assemble with the adaptor protein ASC and procaspase-1, leading to caspase-1 activation, cleavage of pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and pro-IL-18, and generation of the gasdermin D N-terminal fragment that forms membrane pores and executes pyroptosis (kim2019theroleof pages 1-3).

Mitochondrial dysfunction in TECs exacerbates cellular injury by impairing ATP production and increasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which in turn serves as a key upstream trigger for inflammasome activation and subsequent pyroptosis (bhatia2020mitochondrialdysfunctionin pages 2-4). The damaged mitochondria release mitochondrial DNA and cardiolipin, both of which act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), further stimulating innate immune responses and inflammasome assembly (bhatia2020mitochondrialdysfunctionin pages 5-7). Mitochondrial dysfunction also disturbs the balance of mitochondrial dynamics, where enhanced fission mediated by proteins such as DRP1 leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and aggravates ROS production, thereby intensifying the inflammatory cascade (fontechabarriuso2022tubularmitochondrialdysfunction pages 2-4).

Elevated ROS levels not only originate from impaired mitochondrial electron transport but also amplify inflammasome activity by promoting oxidative stress–induced signaling pathways, such as NF-κB activation, which primes TECs for inflammasome assembly (kim2019theroleof pages 1-3). This oxidative environment further triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and leads to the execution of pyroptosis, thereby enhancing tissue damage (bhatia2020mitochondrialdysfunctionin pages 1-2). Persistently increased ROS is also implicated in direct cellular damage and the activation of additional death pathways that converge with inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis to cause tubular injury (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 6-8).

Activated NLRP3 inflammasomes in TECs release IL-1β and IL-18, which not only serve as potent inflammatory mediators but also drive the recruitment and activation of pro-fibrotic immune cells, resulting in a feed-forward loop of inflammation and extracellular matrix deposition (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 32-34). This sustained inflammatory response within the tubular interstitium contributes directly to tubulointerstitial fibrosis, a hallmark of CKD characterized by interstitial collagen deposition, tubular atrophy, and capillary rarefaction that ultimately lead to progressive loss of renal function (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 31-32, OpenTargets Search: Chronic Kidney Disease).

Additionally, inflammasome-independent roles of NLRP3 have been noted in TECs, where it modulates fibrotic signaling via the TGF-β/Smad pathway, contributing further to fibrogenesis and renal dysfunction independent of cytokine-mediated inflammation (kim2019theroleof pages 3-5). The interplay between TEC pyroptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction-derived ROS production, and inflammasome activation establishes a vicious cycle that both initiates and sustains renal tissue injury, leading to progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis and permanent decline in glomerular filtration (zhou2023theroleof pages 1-2).

Therapeutic strategies targeting these interconnected pathways hold promise for mitigating CKD progression; for instance, pharmacological inhibitors of inflammasome components, antioxidants aimed at reducing mitochondrial ROS, and agents that stabilize mitochondrial dynamics could interrupt this cycle of injury and fibrogenesis, thereby preserving renal function (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 32-34).
