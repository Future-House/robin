Query: Chronic kidney disease relevant small-molecule library screens utilizing inflammasome activation assays in human proximal tubular epithelial cells or podocytes, with reported hit compounds inhibiting NLRP3 assembly, IL-1β release, and downstream pyroptosis: what are the key studies and leads identified?

The literature on chronic kidney disease (CKD) has produced a number of potent inflammasome inhibitors, but none of the current reports describe a comprehensive, unbiased small‐molecule library screen performed in human proximal tubular epithelial cells or podocytes that specifically evaluates inhibition of NLRP3 assembly, IL‑1β release, and downstream pyroptosis. Instead, the available evidence stems largely from hypothesis‐driven studies and targeted evaluation in both preclinical CKD models and human renal cell lines.

For instance, several studies have repeatedly demonstrated that MCC950 is a potent small‐molecule inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome. By binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ATP hydrolysis, MCC950 effectively blocks NLRP3 assembly, reducing IL‑1β release and pyroptosis in renal cells. This compound has been cited as a key lead in multiple reports assessing inflammasome activation outcomes in CKD models (liu2023pyroptosisinrenal pages 9-10, williams2023theroleof pages 64-68).

In addition, other pharmacological agents such as BAY 11‑7082 have been shown to inhibit NLRP3 activation by suppressing its ATPase activity while also acting as an NF‑κB inhibitor. BAY 11‑7082 reduces caspase‑1 activation and subsequently decreases IL‑1β release and pyroptotic cell death in kidney cells, including human proximal tubular epithelial cells used in diabetic nephropathy studies (kim2019theroleof pages 7-9, williams2022theroleof pages 5-6).

Tranilast is another compound that has received attention, as it prevents the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), thereby interrupting inflammasome assembly. While it has been shown to reduce caspase‑1 activation and IL‑1β production in animal models of diabetic kidney disease, its identification derives from targeted mechanistic studies rather than from an unbiased small‑molecule screen (liu2023pyroptosisinrenal pages 9-10, kim2019theroleof pages 7-9).

Other compounds such as Fucoidan and Phloretin have been advanced as part of the strategy to mitigate inflammasome-mediated renal injury. Fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide, appears to block NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis in podocytes via modulation of the AMPK/mTORC1 pathway, whereas Phloretin has been tested for its dual ability to inhibit NLRP3 activation and reduce uric acid reabsorption in hyperuricemia-induced CKD models (liu2023pyroptosisinrenal pages 9-10). Similarly, caspase‑1 inhibitors like Z‑YVAD‑FMK and VX‑765 have been shown to reduce IL‑1β/IL‑18 secretion and ameliorate kidney injury, although these agents were identified and validated in both in vitro human kidney cell models and animal studies rather than through primary screening efforts (liu2023pyroptosisinrenal pages 9-10, gu2022targetingpyroptosisnew pages 7-7).

Although reviews by Islamuddin and colleagues, as well as others by Chi and Fan, reinforce the central role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in CKD progression, they do not present findings from library screenings explicitly performed in human proximal tubular epithelial cells or podocytes. Instead, these reviews consolidate data from hypothesis-driven investigations, highlighting compounds like MCC950 and BAY 11‑7082 as prominent leads (islamuddin2024renalmacrophagesand pages 9-10, chi2020researchprogresson pages 7-8, fan2019rolesofinflammasomes pages 7-8).

In summary, while numerous compounds such as MCC950, BAY 11‑7082, Tranilast, Fucoidan, Phloretin, and caspase‑1 inhibitors have shown promising activity in inhibiting NLRP3 assembly, IL‑1β release, and downstream pyroptosis in CKD models, these leads have been identified through focused mechanistic studies rather than comprehensive small‑molecule library screens in human proximal tubular epithelial cells or podocytes (liu2023pyroptosisinrenal pages 9-10, kim2019theroleof pages 7-9, williams2022theroleof pages 5-6, zhou2023theroleof pages 10-11).
