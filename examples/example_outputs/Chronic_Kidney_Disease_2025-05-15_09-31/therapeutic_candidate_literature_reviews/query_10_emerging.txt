Query: Emerging biomarkers of inflammasome activation in chronic kidney disease patients: circulating IL-1β, IL-18, ASC specks, caspase-1 activity, and their prognostic value for disease progression and therapeutic response.

Circulating IL-1β, IL-18, ASC specks, and caspase-1 activity are emerging as promising biomarkers for inflammasome activation in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with potential prognostic utility. Several studies highlight that in multiple forms of kidney disease—including lupus nephritis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), uric acid nephropathy, and ANCA-associated vasculitis—elevated levels of IL-1β and IL-18 in serum and renal tissue correlate with disease activity, severity, and outcomes (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 25-27).

In advanced CKD and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), circulating IL-1β and IL-18 are increased approximately 1.5 and 1.4 times, respectively, compared to normal individuals, partly due to reduced renal clearance compounded with enhanced inflammasome activation via caspase-1. These interleukins, classified as uremic retention solutes, contribute to comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and frailty. Consequently, serum IL-1β and IL-18 have been explored for their prognostic roles in predicting specific complications—for example, IL-1β levels were shown to predict hypotensive episodes during hemodialysis, while IL-18 correlated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 27-28).

The role of ASC specks and caspase-1 activity is also of considerable interest because they underpin the assembly and function of the inflammasome complex. An increase in ASC specks serves as a surrogate marker for the formation of the inflammasome platform, whereas caspase-1 activity directly reflects the cleavage and activation of both IL-1β and IL-18. Studies in conditions like ADPKD have documented elevated caspase-1 activity and associated cytokine release, implying that these measures may offer additional insight into disease progression and therapeutic efficacy (swensonfields2022caspase1andthe pages 2-3).

However, it is important to note that the clinical interpretation of these circulating biomarkers can be influenced by disease context and patient-specific factors such as comorbidities and degree of renal impairment. For instance, uremic toxins can modulate inflammasome responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, potentially confounding the correlation between biomarker levels and actual inflammasome activity (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 11-12, arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 9-11).

From a therapeutic perspective, interventions targeting these cytokines have provided additional support for their clinical relevance. The use of canakinumab—a monoclonal antibody against IL-1β—has reduced major adverse cardiovascular events in CKD patients with elevated inflammation, suggesting that modulation of the inflammasome pathway can have real clinical benefits (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 27-28). In parallel, efforts focusing on the IL-18/IL-18R1 axis also underscore IL-18’s potential as a prognostic biomarker, especially given its association with cardiovascular calcifications and mortality in CKD (thomas2022theil18il18r1signalling pages 25-29).

Numerous clinical trials are investigating these associations further. For example, trials such as NCT04413266 and studies like the AZD4144 trial (NCT06675175) assess inflammasome-related inflammatory cytokines as pharmacodynamic markers in CKD. Although these studies do not yet establish definitive prognostic utility for IL-1β, ASC specks, or caspase-1 activity, they lay the groundwork for future research aimed at defining their roles in predicting disease progression and therapeutic response (NCT04413266, NCT06675175).

In summary, current evidence supports that circulating IL-1β, IL-18, ASC specks, and caspase-1 activity are mechanistically linked to CKD progression and inflammation. Their potential utility in prognostication and in monitoring response to anti-inflammatory or inflammasome-targeted therapies is promising—but further clinical studies with well-matched cohorts and defined endpoints are required to fully validate their prognostic value (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 28-30, thomas2022theil18il18r1signalling pages 6-9).
