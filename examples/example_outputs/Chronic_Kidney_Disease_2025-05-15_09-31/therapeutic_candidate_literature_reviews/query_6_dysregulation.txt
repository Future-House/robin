Query: Dysregulation of NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and related cytokines (IL-1β, IL-18) in human chronic kidney disease patient samples and animal models, including expression patterns in glomeruli, interstitium, and tubular epithelial cells, correlation with disease severity.

The NLRP3 inflammasome pathway is robustly dysregulated in both human chronic kidney disease (CKD) patient samples and animal models. In human CKD, studies consistently show increased levels of NLRP3 inflammasome components—specifically NLRP3, the adaptor ASC, and caspase‑1—in kidney tissues. This upregulation is accompanied by elevated concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines IL‑1β and IL‑18. In human samples, these molecules are notably overexpressed in tubular epithelial cells, but increased expression is also observed in glomerular and interstitial compartments. Such spatial heterogeneity indicates that not only immune cells but also intrinsic kidney cells contribute to the inflammatory milieu, with higher expression of inflammasome components correlating with more severe tubulointerstitial damage, fibrosis, and overall disease progression (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 28-30, antonpampols2022theroleof pages 11-12).

Animal models of CKD—including subtotal nephrectomy, unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), and diabetic nephropathy models—mirror the human findings. In these models, increased activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to enhanced production of IL‑1β and IL‑18, which in turn drive renal inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrotic remodeling. Genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of NLRP3, caspase‑1, or even IL‑1 signaling in these models reduces kidney damage, inflammation, and fibrosis. The protective effects seen with NLRP3 deficiency or inhibition further solidify the inflammasome’s role as a pathogenic driver in CKD (fan2019rolesofinflammasomes pages 4-5, arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 15-16).

Regarding spatial expression, the pattern is complex. Tubular epithelial cells consistently display high levels of NLRP3 expression in both healthy and diseased kidneys. However, in CKD, especially in conditions like IgA nephropathy, a decrease in NLRP3 expression in the tubular epithelium associates with advanced tubular injury, atrophy, and fibrosis; lower tubular NLRP3 mRNA expression correlates with poorer outcomes (chun2016nlrp3localizesto pages 10-11). In contrast, glomerular cells such as podocytes exhibit a more variable pattern—while healthy glomeruli generally show minimal NLRP3 expression, in disease states there is often detectable upregulation that correlates with the severity of glomerular injury and proteinuria (chun2016nlrp3localizesto pages 1-2, kim2019theroleof pages 1-3). Moreover, interstitial inflammatory cells, including infiltrating macrophages, frequently demonstrate increased inflammasome activation, thereby contributing to the chronic inflammatory state and fibrotic changes in the kidney (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 27-28, komada2019theroleof pages 4-6).

The cytokines IL‑1β and IL‑18 are central mediators of the inflammatory responses mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome. IL‑1β, often considered the primary effector cytokine, is produced in higher amounts by both renal parenchymal cells and immune cells; its local and systemic elevation is linked with tubular injury, arrhythmogenesis, and even cardiovascular complications in CKD. IL‑18, which is also generated upon caspase‑1 activation, is similarly elevated in kidney tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Both cytokines not only reflect the degree of inflammasome activation but also serve as biomarkers for disease severity—higher concentrations correspond to more advanced disease, greater fibrotic progression, and poorer clinical outcomes (thomas2022theil18il18r1signalling pages 6-9, mulay2019multifactorialfunctionsof pages 1-2, kim2019theroleof pages 5-7).

Overall, the dysregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its downstream cytokines IL‑1β and IL‑18 in CKD is characterized by spatially distinct patterns of expression in the glomeruli, interstitium, and tubular epithelial cells. The extent of this dysregulation, as well as the resultant cytokine production, correlates strongly with the severity of kidney injury, inflammation, and fibrotic remodeling observed in both human CKD patients and various animal models (antonpampols2022theroleof pages 11-12, arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 28-30, chun2016nlrp3localizesto pages 10-11).
