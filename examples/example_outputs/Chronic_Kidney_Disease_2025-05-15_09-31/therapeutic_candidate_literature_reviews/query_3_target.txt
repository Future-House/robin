Query: Target validation and mechanistic confirmation studies for small-molecule inflammasome inhibitors in CKD models: evidence of direct binding to NLRP3 or upstream regulators, modulation of ASC oligomerization, caspase-1 activation, and impact on renal inflammation and fibrosis.

Small-molecule inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome have been validated in chronic kidney disease (CKD) models through a combination of target engagement studies, mechanistic analyses, and functional outcomes that converge on reduced renal inflammation and fibrosis. In several studies, direct binding of inhibitors to NLRP3 or modulation of its upstream regulators has been demonstrated. For instance, MCC950 has been shown to directly bind the Walker B motif in the NATCH domain of NLRP3, thereby inhibiting ATP hydrolysis essential for both inflammasome‐dependent and –independent activation. This direct binding correlates with decreased caspase-1 activation and reduced IL-1β release, ultimately resulting in improved podocyte histology and decreased proteinuria in CKD models (kim2019theroleof pages 7-9). Similarly, CY-09 has been reported to bind directly to NLRP3, inhibiting its ATPase activity, while OLT1177 prevents the formation of the NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 complex by interrupting critical protein–protein interactions needed for oligomerization (mulay2019multifactorialfunctionsof pages 6-7).

In addition to inhibitors that target NLRP3 directly, upstream regulatory events have been modulated by other compounds. Bay 11-7082, for example, is noted to inhibit the ATPase activity of NLRP3 and, by extension, attenuates caspase-1 activation in macrophages exposed to inflammasome triggers such as ATP, nigericin, and uric acid crystals. Although secondary to its recognized activity as an NF-κB inhibitor, its effects on the inflammasome cascade have been associated with improvements in renal pathology in models of lupus nephritis and diabetic nephropathy (kim2019theroleof pages 7-9, chi2020researchprogresson pages 4-5).

Modulation of ASC oligomerization represents another mechanistic strategy validated by small-molecule inhibitors. Lonidamine (LND), originally characterized as an antineoplastic agent, has been rigorously demonstrated to directly bind the adaptor protein ASC—as evidenced by molecular docking, SPR, and DARTS assays—and consequently inhibit ASC oligomerization. Since ASC oligomerization is a necessary step for pro-caspase-1 recruitment and activation, LND effectively blocks the subsequent formation of the inflammasome complex and caspase-1-mediated maturation of IL-1β and IL-18 (chen2022directlytargetingasc pages 1-2, chen2022directlytargetingasc pages 11-14). Although LND’s studies have been mostly focused on neurological and sepsis models, the mechanism implies that similar ASC-targeted approaches could be beneficial in CKD contexts where inflammasome activation contributes to both inflammation and fibrotic tissue remodeling.

Beyond direct target binding, compounds such as Cf-02 have been explored for their ability to modulate complex formation. Cf-02 interferes with the binding of NEK7 and PKR to NLRP3, disrupts the formation of the NLRP3-ASC complex, and impedes ASC oligomerization. These disruptions lead to reduced caspase-1 enzymatic activity and downstream IL-1β production, thereby ameliorating renal inflammation in severe lupus nephritis models—a condition that shares pathological features with CKD, including inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis (yang2021cf‐02anovel pages 7-8, yang2021cf‐02anovel pages 8-10).

Finally, the functional consequence of these molecular interventions is evident in multiple CKD models, where attenuation of inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activation correlates with reduced renal immune cell infiltration, lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and diminished fibrosis. Genetic models further support these findings, as knockout of NLRP3 or its adaptor molecule ASC leads to significant protection against tubulointerstitial fibrosis and other hallmarks of CKD (mulay2019multifactorialfunctionsof pages 1-2, OpenTargets Search: Chronic kidney disease-NLRP3,ASC,caspase-1).

Collectively, these studies provide robust target validation and mechanistic confirmation for small-molecule inflammasome inhibitors in CKD models by demonstrating that direct binding to NLRP3 or its upstream regulators, interference with ASC oligomerization, and subsequent inhibition of caspase-1 activation can reduce renal inflammation and fibrosis (schwaid2020strategiesfortargeting pages 1-2, chi2020researchprogresson pages 7-8).
