Query: Efficacy of repurposed small molecules originally developed for other inflammatory diseases as NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors in chronic kidney disease models, ranking candidates by potency, cell-based assay IC50, and in vivo efficacy in animal models mimicking CKD progression.

MCC950 is the most potent repurposed inhibitor in the CKD context. Its cell‐based assays have demonstrated low nanomolar inhibition of NLRP3 activation (e.g., an IC50 around 7.5 nM), and in several animal models including hypertensive nephropathy and adenine‐induced CKD, MCC950 has consistently reduced renal inflammation, fibrosis, albuminuria, and functional decline (chi2020researchprogresson pages 7-8, sabra2023adeninemodelof pages 12-13, krishnan2019pharmacologicalinhibitionof pages 11-12). The specificity of MCC950 for NLRP3 and its ability to block the ATPase activity by interacting with the NACHT domain make it a benchmark candidate when ranking inflammasome inhibitors.

BAY 11-7082 is another repurposed molecule with demonstrated efficacy in multiple CKD-relevant models, including diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis. Although its IC50 in cell-based assays has not been provided in detail, its anti-inflammatory effects appear to benefit renal outcomes by reducing macrophage infiltration, inflammasome activation, and gasdermin D pore formation. However, BAY 11-7082’s dual activity as an NF-κB inhibitor complicates its ranking as it might have off-target effects relative to its NLRP3-specific inhibitory action (chi2020researchprogresson pages 4-5, kim2019theroleof pages 7-9).

Tranilast, originally used to modulate allergic responses via histamine release, selectively interferes with NLRP3 assembly by disrupting NLRP3–NLRP3 and NLRP3–ASC interactions. Its use in experimental models such as unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and diabetic nephropathy shows significant reduction in inflammatory cytokines and TGF-β, thereby curtailing fibrosis. Although specific cell-based assay IC50 values are not available for Tranilast, its in vivo efficacy in ameliorating tubulointerstitial injury places it just below MCC950 in the ranking of candidates (kim2019theroleof pages 7-9, mulay2019multifactorialfunctionsof pages 7-8).

β-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a physiologically occurring ketone body that specifically inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by preventing ASC oligomerization and potassium efflux, a mechanism that has shown promise in delaying fibrosis in models of crystal nephropathy. While BHB’s safety profile is favorable given its endogenous nature, its potency measured in cell-based assays remains less clearly defined compared to the nanomolar efficacy seen with MCC950, suggesting that it ranks lower in terms of both cell-based potency and overall in vivo efficacy (kim2019theroleof pages 7-9, mulay2019multifactorialfunctionsof pages 5-6).

NSC828779, a salicylanilide derivative, has emerged as a promising candidate that effectively suppresses the IL-36α/NLRP3 inflammasome cascade. In an experimental UUO model of CKD, NSC828779 significantly reduced renal inflammation and fibrosis, primarily by inhibiting multiple signaling cascades including NF-κB, MAPKs, and Smad2/3 phosphorylation. Although detailed cell-based assay IC50 values for NSC828779 are not explicitly provided, its robust in vivo efficacy in mitigating renal tubulointerstitial lesions suggests that it may be competitive with, or slightly below, MCC950 in potency (yang2021nsc828779alleviatesrenal pages 1-2, yang2021nsc828779alleviatesrenal pages 6-9).

Other candidates such as JC124 and its analog YQ128 have been developed from glyburide derivatives, with JC124 showing an IC50 in the micromolar range (~3.25 µM) and YQ128 advancing to submicromolar potency (IC50 around 0.30 µM) in cell-based assays. However, glyburide itself has a relatively high IC50 (10–20 µM) and is limited by side effects like hypoglycemia. Although these compounds demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects in various models, their in vivo efficacy in CKD has not been as robustly validated as with MCC950, thus placing them further down the ranking (blevins2022thenlrp3inflammasome pages 7-9).

In summary, based on the available evidence from cell-based potency data and in vivo efficacy in animal models that mimic CKD progression, the ranking appears to be: first, MCC950 due to its high potency and clear renal protective effects; second, BAY 11-7082 and Tranilast, which show significant anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic benefits in CKD models but are less selective or potent in direct NLRP3 inhibition; third, NSC828779, offering promising multifaceted inhibition of inflammasome activation; and lastly, BHB, JC124, YQ128 and similar candidates with higher or less defined IC50 values and less comparative in vivo data (chi2020researchprogresson pages 7-8, kim2019theroleof pages 7-9, mulay2019multifactorialfunctionsof pages 5-6, blevins2022thenlrp3inflammasome pages 7-9).
