Query: High-throughput screening methodologies and assay design considerations for identifying novel inflammasome inhibitors in CKD-relevant renal cells, including fluorescence/luminescence readouts for ASC speck formation, IL-1β secretion, and caspase-1 activity in proximal tubular cells.

High-throughput screening (HTS) for novel inflammasome inhibitors in CKD-relevant renal cells requires careful assay design that integrates multiple complementary readouts and physiologically relevant cellular models. One key parameter is the selection of proximal tubular cells, which are central to CKD pathology because they express essential inflammasome components—especially NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1—that mediate inflammation and fibrosis (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 16-18).

Fluorescence-based detection of ASC speck formation provides a direct visual marker for inflammasome assembly. In these assays, employing fluorescently tagged ASC allows the rapid quantification of specks, which appear as distinct punctate structures in the cytoplasm upon activation. This imaging modality should be optimized using robust segmentation algorithms to differentiate true speck signals from diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence, ensuring high assay specificity and sensitivity (nizami2021aphenotypichighcontent pages 1-2). Additionally, selection of proper imaging filters and appropriate cell density is crucial for accurate quantification of speck formation in a high-throughput format (nizami2021aphenotypichighcontent pages 2-3).

Another critical readout is the measurement of IL-1β secretion, which serves as an indirect marker of inflammasome activity through its dependence on caspase-1–mediated processing. Quantifying secreted IL-1β using high-sensitivity luminescence or ELISA platforms allows for multiplexing, complementing direct speck imaging. This dual approach helps ensure that compounds identified in the primary screen exert their effects on inflammasome function rather than non-specific cellular processes (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 28-30).

Caspase-1 enzymatic activity assays further fortify the screening pipeline. Using fluorogenic or luminescent substrates that produce quantifiable signals upon cleavage by active caspase-1 permits real-time monitoring of inflammasome activation. This readout can be integrated into the screening cascade to verify that inhibitors yield a corresponding reduction in caspase-1 activity, thus confirming inflammasome suppression at an enzymatic level (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 5-6).

For CKD-relevant conditions, assay design must mimic pathophysiological stimuli such as hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, or hypoxia, which are known to trigger inflammasome assembly in proximal tubular cells (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 9-11, giuliani2022hypoxichumanproximal pages 10-11). Utilizing hypoxic conditions or co-culture systems with relevant immune cells, such as CD1c+ dendritic cells, may further enhance the physiological relevance of the assay, permitting detection of both intracellular and extracellular markers of inflammasome activation (giuliani2022hypoxichumanproximal pages 12-12).

Quality control metrics are essential for HTS assay reliability. Established parameters such as Z’ factors, strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD), and coefficients of variation (%CV) help verify assay performance and reproducibility (nizami2021aphenotypichighcontent pages 3-4). Integrating these metrics ensures that the fluorescence and luminescence signals collected for ASC specks, IL-1β, and caspase-1 activity are robust enough for screening large compound libraries.

Finally, complementary secondary assays that assess cellular toxicity are required to rule out compounds that may reduce inflammasome readouts due to nonspecific cytotoxicity rather than targeted inhibition. Using orthogonal readouts such as LDH release for pyroptosis adds a further layer of validation for identified hits (nizami2021aphenotypichighcontent pages 4-6).

In summary, the integration of fluorescence-based ASC speck detection, luminescence/ELISA-based IL-1β secretion assays, and caspase-1 enzymatic activity measurements, along with careful control of culture conditions and robust quality metrics, provides a comprehensive HTS strategy for identifying selective inflammasome inhibitors in CKD-relevant proximal tubular cells (giuliani2022hypoxichumanproximal pages 8-10, nizami2021aphenotypichighcontent pages 6-8, nizami2021aphenotypichighcontent pages 8-9).
