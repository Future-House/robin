Query: Genetic and functional studies linking inflammasome components (NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1) to CKD pathophysiology, including GWAS data, gene knockout/knockdown models, and rescue experiments demonstrating causative involvement in renal inflammation.

Inflammasomes are multi‐protein complexes within the innate immune system that, upon activation by pathogen‐ or damage‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs), trigger the autocatalytic activation of caspase‑1, which in turn processes and promotes the secretion of the pro‐inflammatory cytokines interleukin‑1β (IL‑1β) and interleukin‑18 (IL‑18). The key components of this complex include the sensor protein NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis‐associated speck-like protein containing a CARD, also known as PYCARD), and the effector enzyme caspase‑1. Genetic and functional studies have robustly linked these inflammasome components to chronic kidney disease (CKD) pathophysiology.

Genetic association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NLRP3 gene that associate with higher CKD susceptibility and progression. Although explicit genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) data are sparse in the current context, candidate gene polymorphism studies implicate NLRP3 variants, along with variants in regulatory proteins such as CARD8, as influencing CKD risk by modulating inflammasome activation (russa2023associationbetweennlrp3 pages 1-2, russa2023associationbetweennlrp3 pages 9-10).

Functional evidence from murine knockout models provides further causative linkage. In several CKD models, including diabetic nephropathy, hyperhomocysteinemia-induced glomerulopathy, and models of renal fibrosis, mice deficient in NLRP3, ASC, or caspase‑1 display significantly reduced renal inflammation, diminished cytokine production (IL‑1β and IL‑18), and lower degrees of fibrosis and tubular damage compared with wild-type controls. For instance, NLRP3 knockout mice exhibit decreased atrial IL‑1β levels, reduced fibrosis, and preservation of renal function in models that simulate CKD-induced cardiac complications (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 15-16, arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 16-18). Similarly, studies employing ASC-deficient models have shown protection against hypertensive nephrosclerosis, while caspase‑1-deficient mice are protected from acute kidney injury and endotoxemic renal failure, further cementing the functional role of these inflammasome components in kidney pathology (mulay2019multifactorialfunctionsof pages 1-2, komada2019theroleof pages 1-4).

Rescue experiments and pharmacological inhibition studies have provided additional evidence of causation. Pharmacological inhibitors such as MCC950 have been used to inhibit NLRP3 activation, leading to ameliorated renal inflammation and fibrosis in various CKD models. Treatment with IL‑1 receptor antagonists like Anakinra has also demonstrated protective effects in diabetic nephropathy by preventing IL‑1β mediated inflammatory signaling, though the outcomes may vary depending on the specific disease context and whether IL‑1–independent mechanisms are at play (mulay2019multifactorialfunctionsof pages 5-6, komada2019theroleof pages 4-6). Bone marrow transplant experiments, where wild-type bone marrow is replaced with cells from inflammasome-deficient donors, support the view that resident renal cell inflammasomes, rather than infiltrating immune cells alone, play a causative role in CKD progression (mulay2019multifactorialfunctionsof pages 6-7).

Moreover, the mechanistic interplay between oxidative stress—mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the NADPH oxidase system—and inflammasome activation is well documented. Elevated ROS levels in CKD provide a priming signal for NLRP3 activation, linking metabolic disturbances such as hyperglycemia and angiotensin II signaling directly to inflammasome-mediated renal inflammation. These mechanistic studies further support that both inflammasome-dependent and independent functions of NLRP3 contribute to renal fibrosis and podocyte injury in diabetic nephropathy and other CKD forms (arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 22-24, arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 28-30).

In summary, a diverse body of genetic association studies, gene knockout/knockdown models, and pharmacologic rescue experiments converge to demonstrate that inflammasome components—specifically NLRP3, ASC/PYCARD, and caspase‑1—play a causative role in the pathogenesis of CKD by driving renal inflammation and fibrosis. The collective evidence supports the notion that targeting these inflammasome pathways holds significant therapeutic potential in mitigating CKD progression (russa2023associationbetweennlrp3 pages 1-2, arandarivera2022involvementofinflammasome pages 16-18, komada2019theroleof pages 4-6).
