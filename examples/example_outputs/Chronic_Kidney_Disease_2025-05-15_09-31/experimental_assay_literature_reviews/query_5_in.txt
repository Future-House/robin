Query: In vitro assessment of inflammatory cytokine networks and immune cell interactions in CKD, exploring IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha signalling in renal cell types, co-culture with macrophages, chemokine-driven fibrotic responses, NF-kB activation assays

Renal cell‐based in vitro systems have been central to dissecting the role of inflammatory cytokines—especially IL‑1, IL‑6, and TNF‑α—in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Multiple studies report that these cytokines are upregulated under stress conditions (e.g., high glucose exposure) and contribute to the inflammatory milieu that promotes fibrosis and progressive renal injury (OpenTargets Search: Chronic Kidney Disease-IL1,IL6,TNF,NFKB1).

At the molecular level, IL‑1β is frequently identified as a key pro‐inflammatory player. Elevated levels of IL‑1β trigger inflammasome activation (predominantly the NLRP3 complex) leading to a cascade of NF‑κB‐mediated transcription events. These events include the upregulation of chemokines, such as MCP‑1, which are critically involved in recruiting immune cells to the renal microenvironment and subsequently driving fibrotic responses (islam2019humanmesenchymalstromal pages 1-2, islam2019humanmesenchymalstromal pages 17-18). IL‑6 and TNF‑α similarly contribute to inflammation. Under conditions that mimic diabetic kidney injury, human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTEC/TERT1) exhibit increased secretion of IL‑6, IL‑8, and MCP‑1, thereby reinforcing chemokine networks that promote macrophage infiltration (islam2019humanmesenchymalstromal pages 3-5, islam2019humanmesenchymalstromal pages 7-12).

The use of co‐culture systems further enhances our understanding of intercellular cross‑talk. Renal epithelial cells co‐cultured with primary macrophages—derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells—highlight how soluble factors and direct cell–cell interactions modulate inflammatory responses. These models have shown that conditioned media from RPTEC cultures exposed to high glucose can stimulate robust pro‐inflammatory responses in macrophages. Conversely, the presence of immunomodulatory agents such as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) or their conditioned media significantly attenuates cytokine secretion, reducing the propagation of inflammation (alshaghdali2018regulationofmacrophage pages 172-178, islam2019humanmesenchymalstromal pages 5-7).

A critical component of these in vitro assessments is the measurement of NF‑κB activation. Given that NF‑κB is a central transcription factor regulating the inflammatory cascade, assays such as reporter gene assays, Western blots for phosphorylated IκB, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) provide quantitative insights into the activation status of this pathway. Studies have shown that both TNF‑α and IL‑1β strongly induce NF‑κB activity, thereby augmenting the expression of chemokines (e.g., MCP‑1/CCL2) and other inflammatory mediators. For example, experimental disruption of CD40 signaling in proximal tubule cells leads to diminished NF‑κB activation and a corresponding reduction in inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression, illuminating the link between receptor–ligand interactions and downstream NF‑κB‐mediated responses (zhang2020disruptionofcd40 pages 47-51, zhang2020disruptionofcd40 pages 56-71).

Moreover, in vitro models that utilize transwell co‑culture systems, where renal epithelial cells are separated from macrophages by a permeable membrane, further validate these findings. The paracrine signaling observed in these systems confirms that soluble mediators are sufficient to drive macrophage activation and subsequent fibrogenic responses even in the absence of direct cell–cell contact. This approach has proven particularly useful in dissecting chemokine‐driven fibrotic responses and assessing the efficacy of anti‐inflammatory treatments (islam2019humanmesenchymalstromal pages 7-12).

Complementary insights from studies focused on acute sterile inflammation further underscore the intricate regulation of cytokine networks involving NF‑κB, PI3K/Akt, and inflammasome components in both macrophages and renal epithelial cells (luger…2015the12thworld pages 106-107, luger…2015the12thworld pages 138-138). These studies provide additional context and methodological groundwork that inform the design of in vitro assays for CKD research.

In summary, the integration of cytokine profiling, NF‑κB activation assays, and co‑culture models with macrophages establishes a robust framework for elucidating the complex inflammatory cytokine networks and immune cell interactions that underlie CKD pathogenesis (zhang2020disruptionofcd40 pages 21-26, islam2019humanmesenchymalstromal pages 17-18).
