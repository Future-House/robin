Query: Mechanistic exploration of altered transporter activities and metabolic dysfunction in CKD models in vitro, focusing on sodium-glucose cotransporters, organic cation/anion transporters, mitochondrial bioenergetics, glycolytic vs oxidative metabolic shifts in tubular cells

In chronic kidney disease (CKD) models in vitro, altered transporter activities and metabolic dysfunction are interdependent phenomena that contribute significantly to tubular cell injury. At the forefront of these alterations are the sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs), particularly SGLT2, whose overactivity in diabetic kidney disease is associated with enhanced glucose and sodium reabsorption. This hyperactivity not only increases the workload and oxygen consumption of proximal tubular cells but also couples with other transporters like the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE3) to exacerbate metabolic and oxidative stress (ahmad2021mitochondriaindiabetic pages 22-23, vallon2024howcaninhibition pages 1-2). In vitro studies employing kidney organoids and cell cultures have corroborated that SGLT2 inhibition can reprogram cellular metabolism by reducing hyperreabsorption and consequently diminishing mitochondrial overload, thus alleviating hypoxic stress and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.

Metabolic dysfunction in CKD is characterized by a shift in energy metabolism from primarily oxidative phosphorylation to a more glycolytic mode. Under normal conditions, proximal tubular cells rely heavily on mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) due to their high ATP demand for solute transport. However, CKD-associated stress—including nutrient overload, hypoxia, and mitochondrial impairment—forces these cells to switch to glycolysis in an attempt to maintain energy production. Although initially adaptive, persistent glycolysis is maladaptive as it fails to meet the high energy demands of these cells and contributes to tubulointerstitial damage (miguel2023metabolicreprogrammingheterogeneity pages 5-6, hall2022metabolicmechanismsof pages 2-3). In vitro models have shown that this metabolic rewiring is evidenced by increased lactate production, upregulation of glycolytic enzymes, and alterations in glucose transporter expression, such as enhanced GLUT1-mediated uptake in response to hypoxia (vallon2020glucosetransportersin pages 9-11).

Organic cation and anion transporters, which are vital for the excretion of drugs and uremic toxins, are similarly affected by mitochondrial dysfunction. These transporter systems depend on ATP generated from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to drive the active transport of metabolites. In CKD models, impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics leads to reduced ATP availability, compromising the activity of these transporters and thereby perturbing solute homeostasis (doke2022themultifacetedrole pages 1-3, hall2022metabolicmechanismsof pages 1-2). Such impairments may exacerbate the accumulation of toxic metabolites that further injure tubular cells, creating a vicious cycle of metabolic stress and transporter dysfunction.

Furthermore, advanced in vitro models, including kidney-on-a-chip and microdissected tubule preparations, have provided mechanistic insights into the spatial heterogeneity of metabolic alterations along the nephron. These systems reveal that while the early proximal segments (S1/S2) predominantly utilize oxidative metabolism and rely on SGLT2 for glucose uptake, later segments (such as S3) can compensate through increased reliance on glycolytic pathways and SGLT1-mediated glucose transport (chrysopoulou2024metabolicrewiringand pages 4-6, chrysopoulou2024metabolicrewiringand pages 6-7). Computational models further support that SGLT2 inhibition redistributes solute transport to downstream segments, where metabolic efficiency is lower due to differences in oxygen consumption and mitochondrial density (layton2018sglt2inhibitionin pages 1-2).

Finally, defects in mitochondrial dynamics—including imbalances in fission and fusion along with impaired mitophagy—further reduce mitochondrial mass and energy production, which directly impact the efficiency of transporter activities. Restoration of mitochondrial function, whether through pharmacologic intervention or by targeting these mitochondrial quality control processes, has been shown to beneficially modulate transporter function and re-establish the balance between glycolytic and oxidative metabolism (mapuskar2023mitochondrialoxidativemetabolism pages 2-3, hall2022metabolicmechanismsof pages 7-8).

Overall, these mechanistic insights from in vitro CKD models underscore that therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating SGLT activity, improving mitochondrial bioenergetics, and restoring the balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation may collectively offer promising avenues to ameliorate tubular dysfunction in CKD (gewin2021sugarorfat? pages 2-4).
