Query: In vitro cell culture models of CKD evaluating fibrogenesis endpoints in human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells or glomerular mesangial cells, comparison of 2D vs 3D culture systems, organoid platforms, use of co-cultures, shear stress to mimic microenvironment

In vitro models for chronic kidney disease (CKD) fibrogenesis employ human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells and glomerular mesangial cells to assess endpoints such as extracellular matrix deposition, epithelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition (EMT), and fibroblast activation. These endpoints are critical for understanding disease progression and evaluating anti-fibrotic drugs (addario2025kidneyfibrosisin pages 8-9).

Traditional two-dimensional (2D) culture systems involve growing cells on flat substrates, offering simplicity and cost-effective screening despite significant limitations. In 2D monocultures, cells often lose polarity, proper cell–cell interactions, and native extracellular matrix (ECM) cues, which result in incomplete or inconsistent activation of fibrogenic pathways such as TGF-β/Smad signaling and regulation of markers like collagen and αSMA (addario2025kidneyfibrosisin pages 13-14). Additionally, although 2D models can replicate some molecular endpoints, they generally fail to recapitulate the complex architecture and mechanical environment of native renal tissue, which is crucial for accurate assessment of fibrogenesis (tasinato2024developmentofan pages 38-41).

Advanced three-dimensional (3D) culture systems provide a more physiologically relevant microenvironment by incorporating ECM components, promoting cell polarization, and allowing for more accurate cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions. These models range from scaffold-based hydrogels to organoids and on-chip microfluidic devices. In 3D cultures, cells exhibit improved expression of tissue-specific markers, enhanced transporter function, and robust ECM deposition, which better mimic in vivo fibrogenesis endpoints (addario2025kidneyfibrosisin pages 12-13, mucic2024silkfibroinwafers pages 34-37).

Organoid platforms derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are particularly promising, as they self-organize into nephron-like units that more closely replicate the complex cellular heterogeneity found in the kidney. Although these platforms face challenges, including immature nephron structures and variability in vascularization, organoids significantly improve the mimicry of in vivo conditions compared to 2D cultures (addario2025kidneyfibrosisin pages 9-11, yu2021druginducednephrotoxicityassessment pages 5-6).

Co-culture systems, whether in 2D or 3D, add further complexity by enabling paracrine and juxtacrine interactions between epithelial cells and other cell types such as renal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and even mesangial cells. This interplay has been shown to enhance ECM accumulation and modulate fibrotic marker expression more accurately than monocultures do. For example, adding fibroblasts to epithelial cell cultures markedly increases collagen deposition and myofibroblast activation, reflecting a more realistic fibrogenic process (addario2025kidneyfibrosisin pages 13-14, tasinato2024developmentofan pages 292-295).

Furthermore, the application of shear stress via microfluidic or organ-on-a-chip technologies is a critical advancement in these models. Shear stress replicates the hemodynamic forces experienced by renal cells in vivo, thereby influencing cell differentiation, cytoskeletal organization, and junction integrity, which in turn affect fibrogenesis endpoints. Perfusable chip platforms with continuous flow conditions exhibit enhanced functional responses such as better albumin uptake and epithelial barrier function, and they also influence the maturation of both podocytes and tubular cells (addario2025kidneyfibrosisin pages 12-13, ebefors2021modelingtheglomerular pages 6-7).

Despite the advantages of 3D cultures and advanced co-cultures, challenges remain—such as the limited lifespan and standardization of organoid models, the incomplete recapitulation of immune cell involvement in fibrosis, and technical difficulties in integrating long-term shear stress in vitro. In fact, current models still struggle to capture the full complexity of CKD pathology because they often lack immune components and the chronicity observed in human disease (tasinato2024developmentofan pages 295-297, tasinato2024developmentofana pages 292-295).

Overall, moving from 2D to 3D systems, incorporating organoid technologies, employing co-cultures, and integrating mechanical stimuli like shear stress together create more physiologically relevant platforms. These advanced in vitro models improve our ability to interrogate fibrogenesis endpoints in CKD, offering enhanced translational potential for drug testing and mechanistic studies (tasinato2024developmentofan pages 43-45, addario2025kidneyfibrosisin pages 9-11).
