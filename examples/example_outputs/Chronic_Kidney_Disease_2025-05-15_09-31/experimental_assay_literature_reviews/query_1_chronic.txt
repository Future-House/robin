Query: Chronic Kidney Disease pathophysiology focusing on intracellular signaling pathways in renal tubular epithelial cells, including TGF-beta/Smad, mTOR, ROS-mediated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammasome activation, and autophagy/apoptosis interplay in CKD progression

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) progression is driven by maladaptive responses in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) that involve complex intracellular signaling networks. Central to these mechanisms is the transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β)/Smad pathway. Upon injury, TGF‐β1 is upregulated and binds to its receptors, leading to phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2/3. This signaling cascade induces the transcription of genes that promote extracellular matrix deposition and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process whereby TECs lose epithelial characteristics and acquire mesenchymal features that fuel fibrosis (qi2018renaltubularepithelial pages 1-2, qi2018renaltubularepithelial pages 11-11).

Mitochondrial dysfunction is another key factor in CKD pathophysiology. Healthy mitochondria are essential for ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation; however, under stress conditions (such as high glucose exposure), TECs switch from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis, leading to impaired energy production. This metabolic shift results in increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), which in turn cause oxidative damage to cellular components including lipids, proteins, and DNA (zhang2024kidneyagingand pages 8-10, srivastava2020lossofmitochondrial pages 2-3). The excessive mtROS not only impair mitochondrial function further but also act as secondary messengers that activate downstream inflammatory and fibrotic signaling cascades.

ROS-mediated oxidative stress plays a dual role by both directly damaging cellular components and augmenting pro-fibrotic signaling. Elevated ROS levels induce transcription factors such as NF-κB, which enhances the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This oxidative environment can further stimulate TGF‐β signaling, creating a deleterious cycle where inflammation and fibrosis reinforce each other (qi2018renaltubularepithelial pages 2-4, srivastava2020lossofmitochondrial pages 3-4).

The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway intersects with these processes by regulating cellular metabolism and autophagy. Under conditions of stress, mTOR activation impairs autophagic clearance of damaged organelles, including mitochondria. The failure to efficiently remove dysfunctional mitochondria exacerbates ROS accumulation and further damages TECs. Conversely, inhibition of mTOR has been associated with restored autophagy, which helps clear damaged components and mitigates fibrosis (zhang2024kidneyagingand pages 6-8, wang2024exosomesonthe pages 15-16).

Inflammasome activation, particularly via the NLRP3 complex, is triggered by signals from mitochondrial damage such as the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and other damage-associated molecular patterns. The activation of NLRP3 leads to caspase-1 activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, thus amplifying inflammation and contributing to further tissue injury and fibrosis (srivastava2020lossofmitochondrial pages 3-4, gu2021transforminggrowthfactorβ pages 1-2).

Finally, the interplay between autophagy and apoptosis is critical in determining the fate of TECs in CKD. Autophagy, a cellular degradation pathway, normally serves a protective role by removing damaged organelles and proteins. However, if autophagy is dysregulated or overwhelmed, TECs can shift toward apoptotic cell death. This loss of epithelial cells not only diminishes renal function but also contributes to a fibrotic environment, as dying cells release factors that further stimulate TGF‐β signaling and perpetuate ECM deposition (qi2018renaltubularepithelial pages 5-7, zhang2024kidneyagingand pages 22-23).

In summary, CKD progression is orchestrated by a network of intracellular events in TECs that include TGF‐β/Smad-mediated fibrotic signaling, mTOR-regulated autophagy, ROS-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammasome activation, and the balance between autophagy and apoptosis. Each of these interconnected pathways creates a vicious cycle that drives inflammation, cellular injury, and fibrosis, providing multiple targets for therapeutic intervention (qi2018renaltubularepithelial pages 10-11, lin2024targetingmacrophagestherapeutic pages 27-28).
