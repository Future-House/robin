"(A-438079, 2)","(Oridonin, 6)","Both candidates target the inflammasome axis to reduce inflammation and fibrosis in CKD, but they differ in evidence depth, mechanism specificity, safety, and feasibility. Candidate 1 (A-438079) is a well-characterized, potent (IC50 ~40 nM) P2X7 antagonist with robust preclinical data in multiple kidney injury models (cisplatin nephrotoxicity, ischemia–reperfusion, sepsis-induced AKI). Its MoA is clearly articulated: competitive inhibition of ATP binding to P2X7 blocks K+ efflux and upstream NLRP3 assembly, reducing IL-1β/IL-18 release. ADME/PK studies report good bioavailability and minimal off-target effects. Limitations include species variability in P2X7 dependence of injury (e.g., angiotensin II models) and mixed translational history of P2X7 blockers in clinical inflammation. Candidate 2 (Oridonin) directly and covalently inhibits NLRP3 by binding Cys279 in the NACHT domain, preventing oligomerization. Oridonin also modulates NF-κB, p38-MAPK, and activates Nrf2, offering polypharmacology. Preclinical evidence in models of colitis, gout, diabetic nephropathy, and AKI supports renoprotection and anti-fibrosis. However, direct data in podocytes/CKD are limited, and development challenges include moderate potency in non-inflammatory cells, solubility and bioavailability issues requiring formulation work, and possible off-target liabilities from pleiotropic actions. Overall, A-438079 has stronger, targeted evidence in kidney injury settings and clearer translational path via an orally bioavailable, selective small molecule, whereas oridonin’s natural product profile and indirect evidence in CKD present greater uncertainty in efficacy and delivery.","A-438079 (ID 2) is preferred because it has direct, published preclinical efficacy in kidney injury models that are mechanistically linked to chronic inflammation and fibrosis, a clear and proximal MoA (blocking P2X7 to prevent NLRP3 activation), favorable PK/ADME, and a selective target with minimal off-target risk. Oridonin (ID 6) offers a novel covalent NLRP3 inhibition mechanism and pleiotropic benefits but lacks direct CKD or podocyte data, faces formulation/bioavailability hurdles, and carries higher uncertainty for chronic dosing in humans. Therefore, A-438079 has a higher likelihood of successful experimental outcomes and translation into a viable CKD therapy.",0,"(2, 6)","{'hypothesis': 'A-438079 (Tocris, catalog #2947)', 'answer': 'Proposal for A-438079 (Tocris, catalog #2947)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nA-438079 is a synthetic small‐molecule antagonist originally developed as a selective inhibitor of the P2X7 receptor, a ligand‐gated ion channel known to be activated by high concentrations of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The compound belongs to a class of agents that includes disubstituted tetrazoles and cyanoguanidine derivatives, which have been characterized by their ability to selectively block P2X7 receptor activation without significantly affecting other P2X subtypes. Its design and synthesis were initially achieved by pharmaceutical research groups (notably Abbott Laboratories as indicated in early publications) and have since been commercialized by companies such as Tocris (catalog #2947). This class of compounds was originally optimized for studies in inflammatory processes and pain models, as they inhibit ATP‐induced ion flux such as calcium influx and potassium efflux, a key factor in the activation cascade of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nBiochemically and pharmacologically, A-438079 has been investigated in various preclinical models for its ability to mitigate inflammation. It has demonstrated efficacy in rodent models of neuropathic pain and inflammatory conditions by inhibiting P2X7-mediated IL-1β release. In terms of renal applications, there is evidence from several studies that selective P2X7 antagonism can protect against kidney insults such as ischemia-reperfusion injury and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. For example, Zhang et al. (2014) showed that blocking P2X7 with antagonists like A-438079 attenuated cisplatin-induced renal tubular damage by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis markers in mice (Zhang et al., 2014). Additionally, studies such as those by Arulkumaran (2016) and colleagues have demonstrated that while genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of P2X7 in some models does not always equate to improved renal function, the block of P2X7-related signaling reduces inflammasome activation and cytokine release in immune cells and tubular epithelium (Arulkumaran, 2016; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Even though A-438079 has not been widely tested clinically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), its pharmacological profile as a P2X7 antagonist has been well characterized in biochemical studies and preclinical kidney injury models. This builds an indirect but strong rationale for repurposing it in CKD contexts, where sustained inflammation and fibrosis are major pathogenic drivers (Birch et al., 2013; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe primary mechanism of A-438079 is its high-affinity, selective antagonism of the P2X7 receptor. The P2X7 receptor is unique among the P2X family in its requirement for high concentrations of ATP, which are typically achieved in pathological conditions involving cell injury and inflammation. Under normal conditions, extracellular ATP levels are low; however, during tissue damage, ATP is released into the extracellular space where it binds to and activates P2X7 receptors expressed on immune cells (especially macrophages) and renal tubular epithelial cells (Han et al., 2020; Howarth, 2020).  \n\nUpon binding of ATP to the receptor, P2X7 undergoes a conformational change that opens its ion channel, permitting the influx of calcium ions and the efflux of potassium ions. This potassium efflux is a critical upstream event that triggers the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex responsible for activating caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 then cleaves the precursors of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature, secreted forms. These cytokines play major roles in propagating inflammatory signals, inducing pyroptosis (a form of inflammatory cell death), and promoting fibrotic remodeling in affected tissues (Qian et al., 2021; Shokoples, 2022).\n\nA-438079 interacts with the P2X7 receptor by competitively inhibiting ATP binding, thereby preventing the channel’s conformational change and subsequent ion flux. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) is approximately 40 nM in rodent models, indicating high potency (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). By blocking this pathway, A-438079 inhibits downstream events including NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 cleavage, and the release of IL-1β, ultimately reducing inflammatory responses and preventing the activation of fibrotic signaling pathways in kidney tissue, particularly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells where P2X7 and NLRP3 are highly expressed (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the context of chronic kidney disease, the principal pathological mechanisms include persistent inflammation and fibrosis, processes that are significantly driven by inflammasome activation in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. The hypothesis postulates that A-438079 will block ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor in these cell types. By doing so, it prevents the crucial potassium efflux that is necessary for the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The expected downstream effects include a reduction in caspase-1 activation, decreased cleavage of pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β, and ultimately lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This chain of events is anticipated to reduce pyroptosis and curb the progression of fibrosis within the kidney (Qian et al., 2021; Arulkumaran et al., 2018).\n\nRenal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells are known to express both the P2X7 receptor and NLRP3, as evidenced by various studies outlining their roles in mediating inflammation-driven fibrosis in CKD (Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020). In assays, it is expected that treatment with A-438079 would result in a measurable decrease in IL-1β release, reduced markers of inflammation such as caspase-1 activity, and potentially lower expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components. Furthermore, by blunting chronic inflammatory responses, A-438079 may help to preserve kidney structure and function, thereby slowing the progression of CKD. The compound’s favorable pharmacokinetic properties—particularly its demonstrated bioavailability and minimal off-target effects—support the feasibility of achieving these outcomes (Burnstock, 2017).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nA-438079 presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on several factors. One of its major strengths lies in its selectivity and potency as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, which allows it to precisely target an upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that is centrally implicated in CKD. The ability of A-438079 to block ATP-induced ion flux is particularly compelling because it interrupts the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a known driver of IL-1β and IL-18 release in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells (Arulkumaran, 2016; Qian et al., 2021). This molecular specificity holds promise for reducing inflammation and subsequent fibrotic formation in the kidney, both of which are critical elements in CKD progression.\n\nThe preclinical evidence supporting the use of P2X7 antagonists in models of acute kidney injury, such as cisplatin nephrotoxicity and sepsis-induced renal injury, provides additional rationale, even though such models are not perfect surrogates for CKD (Zhang et al., 2014; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Some studies have demonstrated that selective P2X7 blockade can attenuate inflammatory cytokine production, improve renal function markers, and reduce cell death, thereby supporting the hypothesis that similar benefits could be realized in chronic inflammatory settings like CKD (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nAdditionally, the mechanistic details of P2X7 receptor signaling – requiring high extracellular ATP concentrations, initiating K+ efflux, and triggering inflammasome assembly – align closely with the known processes of renal inflammation and fibrosis. The fact that P2X7 and NLRP3 are co-expressed in key renal cell populations reinforces the logic behind using A-438079 to target these pathways (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and potential challenges that need to be considered. Firstly, in some preclinical models, especially in certain rat strains (as noted by studies involving P2X7 receptor knockout rats), the inhibition or deletion of P2X7 did not significantly alter renal function or prevent kidney injury induced by hypertensive factors such as angiotensin II (Nespoux et al., 2024). This suggests that compensatory pathways may exist, and the role of P2X7 might be context-dependent or vary among species. Secondly, clinical trials of P2X7 antagonists in other inflammatory diseases have had mixed outcomes, raising concerns about translational efficacy in human CKD (Luz et al., 2019). Moreover, while the mechanism of inflammasome inhibition is well understood in vitro, the in vivo pharmacodynamics in the kidney may be complicated by variable local ATP concentrations and the dynamic expression of the receptor in disease states.\n\nFrom a drug development standpoint, the potency (IC50 ~40 nM) and reported good bioavailability of A-438079 are advantageous. Its minimal off-target effects also reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions in clinical translation. However, more robust and specific data in CKD models are necessary to establish whether the attenuation of IL-1β release can consistently translate into meaningful improvements in renal fibrosis and overall kidney function over long-term treatment courses (Chen et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2024).\n\nIn summary, A-438079’s targeted inhibition of the P2X7 receptor offers a novel approach to halt the ATP-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby mitigating a key upstream trigger of inflammatory cascades in CKD. Its preclinical track record in inflammatory and renal injury models, combined with its mechanistic specificity, positions it as a strong candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease. Nonetheless, species variability, redundant inflammatory pathways, and the need for further in vivo validation in models of long-term kidney disease remain potential hurdles. If these challenges are addressed in further preclinical and early clinical studies, A-438079 could represent a significant advance in targeting the inflammation-fibrosis axis in CKD (Arulkumaran et al., 2018; Fantauzzi, 2013; Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe strengths of A-438079 for CKD include its high potency, selectivity, and well-elucidated mechanism of action in blocking ATP-induced P2X7 receptor activation—a critical initiator of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. These molecular interactions have been robustly characterized in multiple preclinical studies, indicating that the drug may effectively reduce IL-1β-mediated inflammation and subsequent fibrotic responses. In models of acute renal injury, antagonizing P2X7 has led to reduced cell death and improved renal function, which supports its potential usage in CKD where chronic inflammation is a driver of progressive fibrosis. Moreover, the chemical class to which A-438079 belongs has been extensively employed in studies of inflammatory diseases, reinforcing the feasibility of this approach (Deplano, 2012; Qian et al., 2021).\n\nConversely, potential weaknesses lie in the heterogeneity of experimental outcomes across different preclinical models and species. Some studies have shown that genetic deletion of P2X7 in rats does not always confer renal protection in induced kidney injury, suggesting that the pathophysiology in certain species—or even specific CKD etiologies—may be driven by redundant pathways beyond P2X7/NLRP3. In addition, although A-438079 demonstrates promising in vitro efficacy, there remains a critical need for long-term in vivo studies specifically in CKD models to verify that its anti-inflammatory effects translate into clinically meaningful outcomes in terms of preservation of renal function and reduction in fibrosis. Lastly, it is important to consider potential compensatory mechanisms in chronic inflammation that may limit the sole efficacy of P2X7 inhibition (Nespoux et al., 2024; Luz et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, A-438079 is a scientifically compelling therapeutic candidate for CKD, with robust mechanistic support and significant preclinical evidence in inflammatory models. Its ability to target the P2X7/NLRP3 axis addresses a novel therapeutic area in CKD by potentially halting the progression of inflammation-driven fibrosis. However, potential limitations due to species-specific responses and redundancy in inflammatory signaling must be carefully evaluated in future studies. Overall, A-438079 merits further investigation as part of a multi-pronged approach to modulate inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in chronic kidney disease (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:  \nArulkumaran, N.

As a kaurane-type diterpenoid, its structure comprises four isoprene units arranged into a characteristic tetracyclic skeleton, which is emblematic of this class of natural products. The compound’s discovery and development emerged from the long-standing tradition of using Rabdosia rubescens (also known as Donglingcao) in Asian folk medicine, where it was historically applied for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In the broader context of drug development, diterpenoids such as oridonin have been recognized for their “drug-like” properties; they have provided scaffolds for synthetic modifications aimed at improving potency, solubility, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Moreover, the extraction and study of oridonin reflect an important paradigm in natural products research, wherein historical use is validated and expanded upon with modern medicinal chemistry techniques. This compound, commercially available from suppliers like Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #O2015), fits well within the class of small-molecule natural products that have been repurposed for modern therapeutic applications in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases (Ding et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOridonin’s use spans a broad spectrum of therapeutic applications. Traditionally, the herbal preparations containing oridonin were employed in Chinese medicine to alleviate conditions ranging from pharyngitis and gingivitis to various inflammatory and tumorous conditions. With the advent of modern biochemical and pharmacological research, oridonin has been extensively studied for its anticancer efficacy; many preclinical studies have demonstrated its capacity to induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and suppress metastasis in a variety of cancer cell lines (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In addition to its anticancer properties, several studies have documented oridonin’s robust anti-inflammatory actions. Notably, oridonin has shown efficacy in experimental models of colitis and gout through its inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that mediates the maturation of IL-1β and is a critical driver of inflammatory responses (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020). Although most of the historical and ongoing research has emphasized oridonin’s anticancer and acute inflammatory indications, there is emerging interest in its potential role in renal pathologies. A search on ClinicalTrials.gov using terms such as “Oridonin AND kidney OR renal OR chronic kidney disease OR glomerulonephritis OR proteinuria OR glomerular” returned tens of thousands of trials, indicating significant research activity into natural products and potentially repurposed compounds for kidney diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, to date there is limited direct clinical evidence of oridonin being deployed specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preclinical studies, particularly those involving rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and ischemia–reperfusion injury, have demonstrated renoprotective effects such as reduced inflammatory cytokine levels, diminished fibrosis markers, and improved renal function parameters; these effects suggest that oridonin or its derivatives might be promising candidates for treating CKD or similar renal conditions (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, oridonin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects primarily through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex known to activate caspase-1 and mediate the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. Recent mechanistic studies have shown that oridonin covalently binds to cysteine 279 within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, a critical residue required for the ATPase activity of NLRP3 and its subsequent oligomerization (He et al., 2018). This binding effectively prevents the conformational changes necessary for the recruitment of NEK7, thereby halting inflammasome assembly and activation. In macrophages, this inhibition leads to a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and attenuates inflammatory cell recruitment—a mechanism that has been validated through pull‐down assays and mass spectrometry, which demonstrated nanomolar potency of oridonin in suppressing NLRP3 activation (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020).\n\nBeyond its direct interaction with the NLRP3 inflammasome, oridonin has been shown to modulate additional signaling pathways. For example, it can inhibit NF-κB and p38-MAPK activation, further blunting the inflammatory response, and it has been implicated in the activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidative defenses at lower concentrations, contributing to its cytoprotective effects (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019). These multifaceted actions underscore the polypharmacological nature of oridonin: while its primary mode of action appears to involve covalent modification of NLRP3, its downstream effects extend into a broader anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative network. This convergence on inflammatory signaling pathways is particularly relevant because overactivation of the inflammasome and subsequent pyroptotic cell death are implicated not only in acute inflammatory diseases but also in chronic fibrotic processes within the kidney (Ding et al., 2020).\n\nExpanding the context to renal pathology, the hypothesis driving our proposal is that human podocytes—which are essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier—express components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of NLRP3 in these cells has been linked to pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, which in turn contributes to podocyte loss, proteinuria, and interstitial fibrosis, all hallmarks of CKD. Although most direct evidence of oridonin’s NLRP3 inhibition comes from studies in immune cells like macrophages (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2016), the underlying mechanism is conserved across cell types. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that oridonin could similarly inhibit NLRP3 activation in podocytes, thereby preventing inflammasome assembly, blocking caspase-1 activation, and ultimately reducing the release of IL-1β (Li et al., 2021). By precluding these downstream events, oridonin may attenuate the cycle of inflammatory damage and fibrosis that underpins progressive renal injury in CKD (Li et al., 2021).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the proposed assays and eventual in vivo models of chronic kidney disease, the expected effect of oridonin centers on its ability to protect podocytes from NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated injury. More specifically, by covalently binding to cysteine 279 in NLRP3, oridonin is anticipated to inhibit ATP hydrolysis and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex. This mechanistic blockade should result in a reduction of caspase-1 activation—a key step in the maturation of IL-1β—and thereby diminish the secretion of this potent pro-inflammatory cytokine (He et al., 2018). In podocytes, such suppression is expected to reduce pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death that directly compromises the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and leads to proteinuria. Preservation of podocyte viability would, in turn, help maintain glomerular barrier integrity, minimizing the leakage of plasma proteins into the urine and limiting the ensuing fibrotic response in the renal interstitium (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nMoreover, the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB and p38-MAPK signaling pathways could provide additional benefits by reducing overall renal inflammation. In animal models of kidney injury—such as those induced by ischemia–reperfusion or diabetic nephropathy—treatment with compounds that inhibit these pathways has been correlated with improved renal function parameters (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021). Therefore, beyond its direct effect on podocyte inflammasome activity, oridonin may exert broader renoprotective actions by dampening inflammatory cascades that contribute to interstitial fibrosis and progressive renal insufficiency. In this context, oridonin’s oral bioavailability and established history in traditional medicine support the feasibility of translating these preclinical findings into clinical benefit for CKD patients (Su et al., 2024).\n\nIt is important to note that while direct evidence of oridonin’s effects on human podocytes remains to be fully elucidated, the expression of NLRP3 in podocytes has been demonstrated in experimental models of CKD. Additionally, studies involving natural products that inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome—such as fucoidan in diabetic kidney disease—have provided supportive mechanistic insights, suggesting that the targeting of inflammasome activation in podocytes is a viable therapeutic strategy (Wang et al., 2022).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nOverall, oridonin emerges as a compelling therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease, given its well-documented mechanism of inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome and its extensive background in modulating inflammatory pathways. Its natural origin and historical use in traditional Chinese medicine provide a robust basis for its safety profile, and preclinical studies have demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, including models of colitis, gout, and even acute kidney injury (Ding et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2021). Strengths of oridonin include its specificity for NLRP3 via covalent binding to a critical cysteine residue, which has been shown to yield nanomolar potency in relevant assays (He et al., 2018). Additionally, oridonin’s ability to modulate secondary pathways (NF-κB, p38-MAPK, and Nrf2) may amplify its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective benefits, addressing multiple facets of CKD pathophysiology ranging from podocyte loss to interstitial fibrosis (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nHowever, several weaknesses must also be considered. Despite promising preclinical data in other disease models, direct evidence for oridonin’s efficacy in modulating NLRP3 activation specifically in podocytes remains limited. Most mechanistic studies have been conducted in macrophages or other cell types, and while the extrapolation is reasonable given the conserved nature of inflammasome signaling, dedicated studies using human podocytes are needed to substantiate the proposed protective effects on proteinuria and interstitial fibrosis (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Furthermore, issues such as moderate potency, limited solubility, and variable bioavailability have been noted with oridonin, necessitating further formulation and structural optimization to ensure therapeutic efficacy in a clinical setting (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). These pharmacokinetic considerations are particularly critical for a chronic indication like CKD, where long-term dosing and sustained target engagement are required.\n\nAnother consideration is the translation of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects observed in acute injury models or non-renal tissue into the context of chronic kidney disease, which involves complex and multifactorial pathophysiology. Although the suppression of inflammasome-driven pyroptosis is a promising target for preventing podocyte injury, CKD progression involves additional factors such as hemodynamic stress, metabolic derangements, and immune dysregulation that may not be fully addressed by NLRP3 inhibition alone (Huang et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2020). Consequently, while the mechanistic specificity of oridonin is appealing, its efficacy in a multifaceted chronic disease state like CKD requires rigorous preclinical validation followed by carefully designed clinical trials.\n\nIn summary, oridonin holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease based on its robust anti-inflammatory mechanism, particularly its ability to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome via covalent binding to cysteine 279. The compound’s multifaceted mechanism—encompassing inhibition of caspase-1 activation, IL-1β maturation, and subsequent pyroptosis—could translate into preservation of podocyte integrity, reduction in proteinuria, and attenuation of interstitial fibrosis, all of which are critical endpoints in CKD management (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Nonetheless, challenges related to drug solubility, bioavailability, and the direct demonstration of efficacy in podocytes must be addressed. Given its strong preclinical validation in other inflammatory conditions, further targeted studies focusing on its renal effects and optimization of drug-like properties are warranted before it can be advanced as a viable treatment for CKD (Tan et al., 2021; Su et al., 2024). Overall, while there is a clear mechanistic rationale supporting the therapeutic potential of oridonin in CKD, additional studies specifically assessing its effects in relevant renal cell types and chronic disease models will be critical to fully validate its clinical utility.\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

"(CY-09, 7)","(Oridonin, 6)","Both candidates target the NLRP3 inflammasome, a validated driver of CKD-associated inflammation and fibrosis. Oridonin (ID:6) is a natural diterpenoid with covalent binding to NLRP3 Cys279 and additional anti-inflammatory activity via NF-κB, p38-MAPK, and Nrf2. It has supportive preclinical data in acute kidney injury and diabetic nephropathy rodent models, but direct studies in podocytes and chronic CKD models are limited. Its moderate potency, solubility, and bioavailability issues present formulation and dosing challenges for chronic indications. Off-target effects from broad covalent binding raise safety concerns. CY-09 (ID:7) is a synthetic thiazolidinone derivative designed to selectively bind the Walker A motif of NLRP3 NACHT domain, competitively blocking ATPase activity. It shows nanomolar potency, oral bioavailability, and a favorable safety profile in rodent inflammatory models, with clear MoA and minimal interference with upstream pathways. Although direct CKD models remain to be done, extensive analogous data (e.g., MCC950) in renal inflammation/fibrosis strongly support translatability. CY-09’s specificity reduces off-target risk and its drug-like properties favor chronic dosing. Overall, CY-09 offers superior mechanistic clarity, potency, safety, and translational potential for CKD.","CY-09 is preferred because it delivers a highly specific, well-characterized mechanism of action against NLRP3, with competitive ATP-site binding that prevents inflammasome assembly at an upstream step. Its synthetic design affords nanomolar potency, documented oral bioavailability, and favorable preclinical safety—attributes critical for chronic dosing in CKD. While oridonin has a plausible multi-pathway anti-inflammatory profile and historical use, it suffers from modest potency, solubility/bioavailability hurdles, and broader covalent binding that raises off-target toxicity concerns. CY-09’s targeted inhibition, stronger translational evidence from related renal models, and optimized drug-like properties position it as the more viable candidate for further CKD development.",1,"(6, 7)","{'hypothesis': 'Oridonin (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #O2015)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Oridonin (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #O2015)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nOridonin is a naturally occurring diterpenoid compound isolated primarily from Rabdosia rubescens, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb that has been used for centuries to treat inflammatory conditions and cancers. As a kaurane-type diterpenoid, its structure comprises four isoprene units arranged into a characteristic tetracyclic skeleton, which is emblematic of this class of natural products. The compound’s discovery and development emerged from the long-standing tradition of using Rabdosia rubescens (also known as Donglingcao) in Asian folk medicine, where it was historically applied for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In the broader context of drug development, diterpenoids such as oridonin have been recognized for their “drug-like” properties; they have provided scaffolds for synthetic modifications aimed at improving potency, solubility, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Moreover, the extraction and study of oridonin reflect an important paradigm in natural products research, wherein historical use is validated and expanded upon with modern medicinal chemistry techniques. This compound, commercially available from suppliers like Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #O2015), fits well within the class of small-molecule natural products that have been repurposed for modern therapeutic applications in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases (Ding et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOridonin’s use spans a broad spectrum of therapeutic applications. Traditionally, the herbal preparations containing oridonin were employed in Chinese medicine to alleviate conditions ranging from pharyngitis and gingivitis to various inflammatory and tumorous conditions. With the advent of modern biochemical and pharmacological research, oridonin has been extensively studied for its anticancer efficacy; many preclinical studies have demonstrated its capacity to induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and suppress metastasis in a variety of cancer cell lines (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In addition to its anticancer properties, several studies have documented oridonin’s robust anti-inflammatory actions. Notably, oridonin has shown efficacy in experimental models of colitis and gout through its inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that mediates the maturation of IL-1β and is a critical driver of inflammatory responses (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020). Although most of the historical and ongoing research has emphasized oridonin’s anticancer and acute inflammatory indications, there is emerging interest in its potential role in renal pathologies. A search on ClinicalTrials.gov using terms such as “Oridonin AND kidney OR renal OR chronic kidney disease OR glomerulonephritis OR proteinuria OR glomerular” returned tens of thousands of trials, indicating significant research activity into natural products and potentially repurposed compounds for kidney diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, to date there is limited direct clinical evidence of oridonin being deployed specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preclinical studies, particularly those involving rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and ischemia–reperfusion injury, have demonstrated renoprotective effects such as reduced inflammatory cytokine levels, diminished fibrosis markers, and improved renal function parameters; these effects suggest that oridonin or its derivatives might be promising candidates for treating CKD or similar renal conditions (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, oridonin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects primarily through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex known to activate caspase-1 and mediate the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. Recent mechanistic studies have shown that oridonin covalently binds to cysteine 279 within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, a critical residue required for the ATPase activity of NLRP3 and its subsequent oligomerization (He et al., 2018). This binding effectively prevents the conformational changes necessary for the recruitment of NEK7, thereby halting inflammasome assembly and activation. In macrophages, this inhibition leads to a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and attenuates inflammatory cell recruitment—a mechanism that has been validated through pull‐down assays and mass spectrometry, which demonstrated nanomolar potency of oridonin in suppressing NLRP3 activation (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020).\n\nBeyond its direct interaction with the NLRP3 inflammasome, oridonin has been shown to modulate additional signaling pathways. For example, it can inhibit NF-κB and p38-MAPK activation, further blunting the inflammatory response, and it has been implicated in the activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidative defenses at lower concentrations, contributing to its cytoprotective effects (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019). These multifaceted actions underscore the polypharmacological nature of oridonin: while its primary mode of action appears to involve covalent modification of NLRP3, its downstream effects extend into a broader anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative network. This convergence on inflammatory signaling pathways is particularly relevant because overactivation of the inflammasome and subsequent pyroptotic cell death are implicated not only in acute inflammatory diseases but also in chronic fibrotic processes within the kidney (Ding et al., 2020).\n\nExpanding the context to renal pathology, the hypothesis driving our proposal is that human podocytes—which are essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier—express components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of NLRP3 in these cells has been linked to pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, which in turn contributes to podocyte loss, proteinuria, and interstitial fibrosis, all hallmarks of CKD. Although most direct evidence of oridonin’s NLRP3 inhibition comes from studies in immune cells like macrophages (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2016), the underlying mechanism is conserved across cell types. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that oridonin could similarly inhibit NLRP3 activation in podocytes, thereby preventing inflammasome assembly, blocking caspase-1 activation, and ultimately reducing the release of IL-1β (Li et al., 2021). By precluding these downstream events, oridonin may attenuate the cycle of inflammatory damage and fibrosis that underpins progressive renal injury in CKD (Li et al., 2021).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the proposed assays and eventual in vivo models of chronic kidney disease, the expected effect of oridonin centers on its ability to protect podocytes from NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated injury. More specifically, by covalently binding to cysteine 279 in NLRP3, oridonin is anticipated to inhibit ATP hydrolysis and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex. This mechanistic blockade should result in a reduction of caspase-1 activation—a key step in the maturation of IL-1β—and thereby diminish the secretion of this potent pro-inflammatory cytokine (He et al., 2018). In podocytes, such suppression is expected to reduce pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death that directly compromises the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and leads to proteinuria. Preservation of podocyte viability would, in turn, help maintain glomerular barrier integrity, minimizing the leakage of plasma proteins into the urine and limiting the ensuing fibrotic response in the renal interstitium (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nMoreover, the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB and p38-MAPK signaling pathways could provide additional benefits by reducing overall renal inflammation. In animal models of kidney injury—such as those induced by ischemia–reperfusion or diabetic nephropathy—treatment with compounds that inhibit these pathways has been correlated with improved renal function parameters (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021). Therefore, beyond its direct effect on podocyte inflammasome activity, oridonin may exert broader renoprotective actions by dampening inflammatory cascades that contribute to interstitial fibrosis and progressive renal insufficiency. In this context, oridonin’s oral bioavailability and established history in traditional medicine support the feasibility of translating these preclinical findings into clinical benefit for CKD patients (Su et al., 2024).\n\nIt is important to note that while direct evidence of oridonin’s effects on human podocytes remains to be fully elucidated, the expression of NLRP3 in podocytes has been demonstrated in experimental models of CKD. Additionally, studies involving natural products that inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome—such as fucoidan in diabetic kidney disease—have provided supportive mechanistic insights, suggesting that the targeting of inflammasome activation in podocytes is a viable therapeutic strategy (Wang et al., 2022).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nOverall, oridonin emerges as a compelling therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease, given its well-documented mechanism of inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome and its extensive background in modulating inflammatory pathways. Its natural origin and historical use in traditional Chinese medicine provide a robust basis for its safety profile, and preclinical studies have demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, including models of colitis, gout, and even acute kidney injury (Ding et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2021). Strengths of oridonin include its specificity for NLRP3 via covalent binding to a critical cysteine residue, which has been shown to yield nanomolar potency in relevant assays (He et al., 2018). Additionally, oridonin’s ability to modulate secondary pathways (NF-κB, p38-MAPK, and Nrf2) may amplify its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective benefits, addressing multiple facets of CKD pathophysiology ranging from podocyte loss to interstitial fibrosis (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nHowever, several weaknesses must also be considered. Despite promising preclinical data in other disease models, direct evidence for oridonin’s efficacy in modulating NLRP3 activation specifically in podocytes remains limited. Most mechanistic studies have been conducted in macrophages or other cell types, and while the extrapolation is reasonable given the conserved nature of inflammasome signaling, dedicated studies using human podocytes are needed to substantiate the proposed protective effects on proteinuria and interstitial fibrosis (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Furthermore, issues such as moderate potency, limited solubility, and variable bioavailability have been noted with oridonin, necessitating further formulation and structural optimization to ensure therapeutic efficacy in a clinical setting (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). These pharmacokinetic considerations are particularly critical for a chronic indication like CKD, where long-term dosing and sustained target engagement are required.\n\nAnother consideration is the translation of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects observed in acute injury models or non-renal tissue into the context of chronic kidney disease, which involves complex and multifactorial pathophysiology. Although the suppression of inflammasome-driven pyroptosis is a promising target for preventing podocyte injury, CKD progression involves additional factors such as hemodynamic stress, metabolic derangements, and immune dysregulation that may not be fully addressed by NLRP3 inhibition alone (Huang et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2020). Consequently, while the mechanistic specificity of oridonin is appealing, its efficacy in a multifaceted chronic disease state like CKD requires rigorous preclinical validation followed by carefully designed clinical trials.\n\nIn summary, oridonin holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease based on its robust anti-inflammatory mechanism, particularly its ability to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome via covalent binding to cysteine 279. The compound’s multifaceted mechanism—encompassing inhibition of caspase-1 activation, IL-1β maturation, and subsequent pyroptosis—could translate into preservation of podocyte integrity, reduction in proteinuria, and attenuation of interstitial fibrosis, all of which are critical endpoints in CKD management (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Nonetheless, challenges related to drug solubility, bioavailability, and the direct demonstration of efficacy in podocytes must be addressed. Given its strong preclinical validation in other inflammatory conditions, further targeted studies focusing on its renal effects and optimization of drug-like properties are warranted before it can be advanced as a viable treatment for CKD (Tan et al., 2021; Su et al., 2024). Overall, while there is a clear mechanistic rationale supporting the therapeutic potential of oridonin in CKD, additional studies specifically assessing its effects in relevant renal cell types and chronic disease models will be critical to fully validate its clinical utility.\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

Chemically, CY-09 belongs to the class of thiazolidinone derivatives, a category known for its capacity to interfere with enzymatic activities via covalent or non-covalent interactions. Its development was driven by the need to specifically target the ATP-binding site within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, particularly focusing on the Walker A motif—a conserved nucleotide-binding region that is essential for the ATPase activity required for NLRP3 oligomerization. The design rationale behind CY-09 was based on structure-based drug design principles, where the compound was engineered to directly bind NLRP3, thereby preventing the conformational changes necessary for inflammasome assembly. This chemical class has previously been used in various contexts to modulate protein–enzyme interactions, and its application in inflammasome biology represents an evolution of this approach to target excessive inflammation mediated by the innate immune system (Jiang et al., 2017; Bertinaria et al., 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of CY-09 is rooted in preclinical studies where it has been extensively characterized in vitro and in animal models of inflammatory diseases. Initially, CY-09 demonstrated potent inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in murine bone marrow–derived macrophages stimulated with canonical activators such as ATP, nigericin, and monosodium urate crystals, showing a dose-dependent reduction in IL-1β secretion and caspase-1 activation. Its efficacy has been documented in rodent models of sepsis and colitis, as well as in metabolic disorder models where NLRP3-driven inflammation is a core pathological feature. Although no clinical trials having been completed in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) specifically have been reported to date, the compound’s inclusion in multiple clinical trial searches (ClinicalTrials.gov) indicates that there is active interest in repurposing or further evaluating NLRP3 inhibitors like CY-09 in kidney-related conditions. Furthermore, the extensive body of work demonstrating that NLRP3 knockout or pharmacological inhibition confers protection against renal fibrosis, tubular inflammation, and other hallmarks of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Zhou & Li, 2023) supports the translational potential of a molecule such as CY-09. Historically, similar NLRP3 inhibitors (for example, MCC950) have been applied in various preclinical models of inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and their protective effects in conditions like diabetic nephropathy and ischemia-reperfusion injury provide a strong rationale for applying CY-09 in CKD (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nCY-09 exerts its therapeutic action by directly binding to the NLRP3 protein at its NACHT domain, specifically targeting the Walker A (or P-loop) motif responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis. This binding event competitively inhibits ATP from accessing the site, thereby blocking the ATPase activity essential for NLRP3 oligomerization. Without ATP hydrolysis, NLRP3 is unable to undergo the conformational rearrangements necessary for the aggregation of multiple NLRP3 molecules into the inflammasome complex. Consequently, the formation of the adaptor protein ASC specks is prevented, leading to a blockade of pro-caspase-1 activation and subsequent cleavage into its active form. This chain of events ultimately results in a reduction of the maturation and secretion of the central proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and it halts gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis—a form of lytic, inflammatory cell death that substantially contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis in CKD. Importantly, studies have demonstrated that CY-09 does not interfere with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, underscoring its molecular specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2019). The molecular interaction of CY-09 is supported by biotinylated pull-down assays which confirm its selective binding to NLRP3 over other inflammasome components, and computational docking models corroborate a binding mode that is competitive with ATP at the Walker A motif (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017). This detailed molecular mechanism signifies that CY-09 operates at an early and critical step in the inflammasome pathway, making it a highly attractive candidate for diseases with a significant inflammatory component, such as CKD (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe proposed hypothesis for applying CY-09 to CKD is that by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in human proximal tubular epithelial cells, the compound will inhibit ATPase-driven oligomerization of NLRP3, thereby reducing the formation of ASC specks, the activation of caspase-1, and the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. The downstream effect of blocking these events is the inhibition of gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis, which is known to drive tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrotic remodeling—a central hallmark in the progression of CKD. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, NLRP3 is expressed and activated in response to various stress stimuli, including oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and metabolic dysregulation, all of which are common in CKD pathogenesis. By impeding this pathway, CY-09 is expected to diminish inflammatory cytokine secretion and reduce cell death, thereby preserving tubular integrity, minimizing interstitial inflammation, and preventing the fibrotic changes that culminate in renal function decline (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Data from preclinical models of kidney injury, such as those using MCC950 and other NLRP3 knockout models, have consistently shown improvements in renal structure and function, and reduction in profibrotic markers upon inhibition of the NLRP3 pathway (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017). Furthermore, oral bioavailability and a favorable safety profile in rodent studies enhance the clinical feasibility of CY-09 as a repurposed agent for CKD (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The expected effects in a CKD model would therefore include reduced extracellular matrix deposition, lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the renal interstitium, and overall attenuation of the fibrotic process, translating ultimately into stabilization of renal function (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nBased on the comprehensive literature review, CY-09 emerges as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease. One of its greatest strengths lies in its robust and specific mechanism of action; by directly binding to the Walker A motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3, CY-09 efficiently prevents the initial ATP-driven steps that are critical for inflammasome assembly. This targeted inhibition ensures that downstream activation events—namely ASC speck formation, caspase-1 activation, and subsequent IL-1β/IL-18 maturation—are effectively suppressed. Such specificity is critical for minimizing off-target effects, as CY-09 has shown no significant interference with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, which could reduce undesirable immunosuppressive side effects (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The repurposing strategy is further supported by extensive preclinical evidence indicating that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 results in marked protection against renal fibrosis and inflammation in various CKD models. The preclinical efficacy of similar NLRP3 inhibitors such as MCC950 in models of diabetic nephropathy, cisplatin-induced renal injury, and ischemia-reperfusion injury reinforces the therapeutic potential of targeting NLRP3 in kidney disease (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017).\n\nAnother significant strength of CY-09 is its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile in rodent studies, which is an important consideration for chronic administration required in CKD therapy (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). This pharmacokinetic profile, along with the compound’s high potency in inflammatory assays where nanomolar inhibitory effects have been observed, provides confidence that CY-09 could achieve therapeutically effective concentrations in the kidney without systemic toxicity.\n\nHowever, there are also challenges and uncertainties. Although extensive preclinical studies in inflammatory disease models support the potential of CY-09, direct evidence of its efficacy in chronic kidney disease models specifically remains limited. The majority of studies to date have focused on sepsis, metabolic disorders, and murine colitis rather than on kidney-specific outcomes. There is, therefore, a need for more targeted preclinical research in CKD models—including those mimicking diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and cisplatin-induced renal fibrosis—to definitively establish the renoprotective effects of CY-09 (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Additionally, while the mechanism is well-characterized in immune cells like macrophages, further studies need to elucidate its effects specifically in human proximal tubular epithelial cells and other renal cell types that contribute to CKD progression. Such studies should evaluate not only biochemical markers of inflammasome activation but also functional outcomes like proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate, and histological indices of fibrosis.\n\nAnother potential weakness concerns the translational gap between rodent models and human CKD. The pathophysiology of CKD is multifactorial, and while NLRP3-mediated inflammation is a key driver, the disease process involves many convergent signaling pathways including TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling and oxidative stress pathways. It is possible that the blockade of NLRP3 alone may not be sufficient to fully arrest disease progression in humans. In addition, although CY-09 appears selective based on current evidence, there is always the risk of off-target effects when a compound modulates ATPase activity, given the abundance of ATP-binding proteins in the cell. Careful profiling of CY-09 against a broad spectrum of other ATPases and kinases will be necessary to confirm its selectivity in a clinical setting (Sandall et al., 2020).\n\nIn summary, CY-09 represents an innovative and mechanistically compelling therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease due to its direct inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a central mediator of renal inflammation and fibrosis. Its synthesis as a thiazolidinone derivative and its proven ability to bind the Walker A motif within the NACHT domain underscore its potential to precisely block inflammasome-driven pyroptosis. Preclinical evidence from models of various inflammatory conditions, along with robust biochemical data demonstrating nanomolar potency in macrophage assays, provides a strong rationale for its repurposing in kidney disease. Furthermore, its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety in rodent studies enhance its translational appeal. Nonetheless, additional research is needed to specifically validate its efficacy in CKD models, assess its long-term safety, and determine its pharmacodynamic effects in kidney-specific cell types such as proximal tubular epithelial cells. Overall, the strengths of CY-09’s targeted mechanism, coupled with supportive preclinical efficacy data from related inflammatory models, make it a promising candidate for further development and evaluation in Chronic Kidney Disease (ClinicalTrials.gov; Jiang et al., 2017; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nBertinaria, M., Gastaldi, S., Marini, E., & Giorgis, M.

"(MCC950, 9)","(CY-09, 7)","Both CY-09 and MCC950 are highly selective, small-molecule inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome, targeting the NACHT domain to block ATP-driven activation and pyroptosis. CY-09 binds the Walker A motif and has demonstrated potent nanomolar inhibition of IL-1β release in macrophages, with efficacy in rodent models of sepsis, colitis, and metabolic inflammation. It shows oral bioavailability and a favorable safety profile in rodents. However, CY-09 has not yet been directly tested in CKD-specific in vivo models; its rationale for CKD is extrapolated from genetic knockout and MCC950 studies. MCC950 binds the Walker B motif, prevents ATP hydrolysis, and is considered the gold standard NLRP3 inhibitor. Crucially, MCC950 has been extensively characterized in multiple CKD-relevant animal models—including diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, adenine-induced renal failure, and cisplatin-induced fibrosis—demonstrating improvements in proteinuria, blood pressure, histopathology, and fibrotic markers. It also shows favorable oral bioavailability and safety in non-human primate studies. Both compounds have clear, specific MoA and acceptable oral PK for chronic administration in CKD. However, MCC950’s direct efficacy in CKD models and its advanced safety characterization substantially outweigh the more limited, indirect CKD data for CY-09.","MCC950 is the stronger candidate because it has robust, directly relevant preclinical evidence in multiple CKD models, a well‐elucidated mechanism with high specificity, and an advanced safety profile including non-human primates. CY-09, while mechanistically sound and potent in inflammatory models, lacks direct in vivo CKD validation and clinical safety data, making its translatability more uncertain.",2,"(7, 9)","{'hypothesis': 'CY-09 (Selleckchem, catalog #S8614)', 'answer': 'Proposal for CY-09 (Selleckchem, catalog #S8614)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nCY-09 is a synthetic, small-molecule inhibitor discovered through a focused drug development campaign that initially screened analogs of CFTR inhibitors (specifically C172) and later optimized them to generate compounds with potent and selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Chemically, CY-09 belongs to the class of thiazolidinone derivatives, a category known for its capacity to interfere with enzymatic activities via covalent or non-covalent interactions. Its development was driven by the need to specifically target the ATP-binding site within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, particularly focusing on the Walker A motif—a conserved nucleotide-binding region that is essential for the ATPase activity required for NLRP3 oligomerization. The design rationale behind CY-09 was based on structure-based drug design principles, where the compound was engineered to directly bind NLRP3, thereby preventing the conformational changes necessary for inflammasome assembly. This chemical class has previously been used in various contexts to modulate protein–enzyme interactions, and its application in inflammasome biology represents an evolution of this approach to target excessive inflammation mediated by the innate immune system (Jiang et al., 2017; Bertinaria et al., 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of CY-09 is rooted in preclinical studies where it has been extensively characterized in vitro and in animal models of inflammatory diseases. Initially, CY-09 demonstrated potent inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in murine bone marrow–derived macrophages stimulated with canonical activators such as ATP, nigericin, and monosodium urate crystals, showing a dose-dependent reduction in IL-1β secretion and caspase-1 activation. Its efficacy has been documented in rodent models of sepsis and colitis, as well as in metabolic disorder models where NLRP3-driven inflammation is a core pathological feature. Although no clinical trials having been completed in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) specifically have been reported to date, the compound’s inclusion in multiple clinical trial searches (ClinicalTrials.gov) indicates that there is active interest in repurposing or further evaluating NLRP3 inhibitors like CY-09 in kidney-related conditions. Furthermore, the extensive body of work demonstrating that NLRP3 knockout or pharmacological inhibition confers protection against renal fibrosis, tubular inflammation, and other hallmarks of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Zhou & Li, 2023) supports the translational potential of a molecule such as CY-09. Historically, similar NLRP3 inhibitors (for example, MCC950) have been applied in various preclinical models of inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and their protective effects in conditions like diabetic nephropathy and ischemia-reperfusion injury provide a strong rationale for applying CY-09 in CKD (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nCY-09 exerts its therapeutic action by directly binding to the NLRP3 protein at its NACHT domain, specifically targeting the Walker A (or P-loop) motif responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis. This binding event competitively inhibits ATP from accessing the site, thereby blocking the ATPase activity essential for NLRP3 oligomerization. Without ATP hydrolysis, NLRP3 is unable to undergo the conformational rearrangements necessary for the aggregation of multiple NLRP3 molecules into the inflammasome complex. Consequently, the formation of the adaptor protein ASC specks is prevented, leading to a blockade of pro-caspase-1 activation and subsequent cleavage into its active form. This chain of events ultimately results in a reduction of the maturation and secretion of the central proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and it halts gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis—a form of lytic, inflammatory cell death that substantially contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis in CKD. Importantly, studies have demonstrated that CY-09 does not interfere with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, underscoring its molecular specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2019). The molecular interaction of CY-09 is supported by biotinylated pull-down assays which confirm its selective binding to NLRP3 over other inflammasome components, and computational docking models corroborate a binding mode that is competitive with ATP at the Walker A motif (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017). This detailed molecular mechanism signifies that CY-09 operates at an early and critical step in the inflammasome pathway, making it a highly attractive candidate for diseases with a significant inflammatory component, such as CKD (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe proposed hypothesis for applying CY-09 to CKD is that by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in human proximal tubular epithelial cells, the compound will inhibit ATPase-driven oligomerization of NLRP3, thereby reducing the formation of ASC specks, the activation of caspase-1, and the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. The downstream effect of blocking these events is the inhibition of gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis, which is known to drive tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrotic remodeling—a central hallmark in the progression of CKD. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, NLRP3 is expressed and activated in response to various stress stimuli, including oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and metabolic dysregulation, all of which are common in CKD pathogenesis. By impeding this pathway, CY-09 is expected to diminish inflammatory cytokine secretion and reduce cell death, thereby preserving tubular integrity, minimizing interstitial inflammation, and preventing the fibrotic changes that culminate in renal function decline (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Data from preclinical models of kidney injury, such as those using MCC950 and other NLRP3 knockout models, have consistently shown improvements in renal structure and function, and reduction in profibrotic markers upon inhibition of the NLRP3 pathway (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017). Furthermore, oral bioavailability and a favorable safety profile in rodent studies enhance the clinical feasibility of CY-09 as a repurposed agent for CKD (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The expected effects in a CKD model would therefore include reduced extracellular matrix deposition, lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the renal interstitium, and overall attenuation of the fibrotic process, translating ultimately into stabilization of renal function (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nBased on the comprehensive literature review, CY-09 emerges as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease. One of its greatest strengths lies in its robust and specific mechanism of action; by directly binding to the Walker A motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3, CY-09 efficiently prevents the initial ATP-driven steps that are critical for inflammasome assembly. This targeted inhibition ensures that downstream activation events—namely ASC speck formation, caspase-1 activation, and subsequent IL-1β/IL-18 maturation—are effectively suppressed. Such specificity is critical for minimizing off-target effects, as CY-09 has shown no significant interference with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, which could reduce undesirable immunosuppressive side effects (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The repurposing strategy is further supported by extensive preclinical evidence indicating that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 results in marked protection against renal fibrosis and inflammation in various CKD models. The preclinical efficacy of similar NLRP3 inhibitors such as MCC950 in models of diabetic nephropathy, cisplatin-induced renal injury, and ischemia-reperfusion injury reinforces the therapeutic potential of targeting NLRP3 in kidney disease (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017).\n\nAnother significant strength of CY-09 is its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile in rodent studies, which is an important consideration for chronic administration required in CKD therapy (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). This pharmacokinetic profile, along with the compound’s high potency in inflammatory assays where nanomolar inhibitory effects have been observed, provides confidence that CY-09 could achieve therapeutically effective concentrations in the kidney without systemic toxicity.\n\nHowever, there are also challenges and uncertainties. Although extensive preclinical studies in inflammatory disease models support the potential of CY-09, direct evidence of its efficacy in chronic kidney disease models specifically remains limited. The majority of studies to date have focused on sepsis, metabolic disorders, and murine colitis rather than on kidney-specific outcomes. There is, therefore, a need for more targeted preclinical research in CKD models—including those mimicking diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and cisplatin-induced renal fibrosis—to definitively establish the renoprotective effects of CY-09 (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Additionally, while the mechanism is well-characterized in immune cells like macrophages, further studies need to elucidate its effects specifically in human proximal tubular epithelial cells and other renal cell types that contribute to CKD progression. Such studies should evaluate not only biochemical markers of inflammasome activation but also functional outcomes like proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate, and histological indices of fibrosis.\n\nAnother potential weakness concerns the translational gap between rodent models and human CKD. The pathophysiology of CKD is multifactorial, and while NLRP3-mediated inflammation is a key driver, the disease process involves many convergent signaling pathways including TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling and oxidative stress pathways. It is possible that the blockade of NLRP3 alone may not be sufficient to fully arrest disease progression in humans. In addition, although CY-09 appears selective based on current evidence, there is always the risk of off-target effects when a compound modulates ATPase activity, given the abundance of ATP-binding proteins in the cell. Careful profiling of CY-09 against a broad spectrum of other ATPases and kinases will be necessary to confirm its selectivity in a clinical setting (Sandall et al., 2020).\n\nIn summary, CY-09 represents an innovative and mechanistically compelling therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease due to its direct inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a central mediator of renal inflammation and fibrosis. Its synthesis as a thiazolidinone derivative and its proven ability to bind the Walker A motif within the NACHT domain underscore its potential to precisely block inflammasome-driven pyroptosis.

Furthermore, its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety in rodent studies enhance its translational appeal.

It belongs to the diarylsulfonylurea class of compounds, which emerged from medicinal chemistry efforts that initially focused on sulfonylurea drugs such as glyburide. Glyburide was found to have anti‐inflammatory properties mediated by inhibition of the NLRP3 complex; however, its clinical utility as an anti-inflammatory agent was limited by its potent effects on insulin release and the consequent risk of hypoglycemia. To overcome these limitations, researchers refined the chemical structure and synthesized MCC950, a derivative that retains the inflammasome inhibitory activity of glyburide without disturbing insulin secretion. The design of MCC950 was based on structure–activity relationship studies that identified the importance of the diarylsulfonylurea moiety, and its eventual discovery positioned it as a gold-standard benchmark compound for NLRP3 inhibition (Kaur et al., 2025; Coll et al., 2019). This compound has been synthesized and purified by several vendors including Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #SML 2233), ensuring reproducibility and accessibility to research teams. Overall, MCC950 represents a promising example of rational drug design aimed at selectively targeting components of the innate immune system and addressing the inflammatory cascades that contribute to disease pathology.\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of MCC950 is marked by extensive preclinical evidence spanning animal models of a wide array of inflammatory disorders. Initially investigated in models of auto-inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, MCC950 quickly emerged as the benchmark inhibitor for studying NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated inflammation. In rodent models of kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, and adenine-induced chronic renal failure, MCC950 has demonstrated significant reductions in proteinuria, attenuated fibrosis, and improvements in overall renal function (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). Preclinical studies conducted in diabetic models have shown that chronic treatment with MCC950 leads to marked improvements in histopathological kidney damage, as evidenced by reduced mesangial expansion and decreased podocyte injury (Zhang et al., 2019). In addition, rodent studies in salt-sensitive hypertensive models reveal that inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome via MCC950 results in lower blood pressure, decreased interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, and reduced collagen deposition in renal tissues (Krishnan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2025). Although robust evidence from animal studies supports its efficacy in models of chronic kidney disease (CKD), clinical translation remains limited with only sparse early-phase clinical trials referenced in the literature (ClinicalTrials.gov). Additionally, the favorable safety profile observed in non-human primate studies further underpins its potential for repurposing in CKD, although more clinical data are needed to fully establish its benefit–risk profile.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nMCC950’s mechanism of action is both specific and well-characterized at the molecular level. The compound exerts its inhibitory effect by directly binding to the Walker B motif located within the NACHT domain of the NLRP3 protein. This binding interferes with the ATP hydrolysis that is essential for NLRP3 activation and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Under normal pathological conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC and the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form. Active caspase-1 then processes pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature forms and also initiates gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death. By preventing ATP hydrolysis, MCC950 locks NLRP3 in an inactive conformation, thereby obstructing the assembly of the entire inflammasome complex, reducing caspase-1 activation and cytokine maturation (Kim et al., 2019; Zhan et al., 2023). In the context of human tubular epithelial cells (TECs), which express NLRP3 and contribute to renal inflammatory cascades, MCC950’s engagement with the Walker B motif is proposed to significantly curb inflammasome formation. Such direct target engagement has been validated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and mutagenesis assays that confirm the drug’s specificity and potency. Blocking inflammasome assembly not only reduces cytokine release but also limits the formation of gasdermin D pores that are responsible for pyroptotic cell death, thereby preventing tubular cell loss and reducing interstitial inflammation (Liu et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven its robust preclinical evidence, the expected effect of MCC950 in assays focusing on CKD and related kidney injury is multifaceted. In in vitro models using human TECs, the hypothesis is that treatment with MCC950 will prevent ATP hydrolysis, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. As a result, the maturation and release of IL-1β and IL-18 will be significantly reduced, ultimately leading to lower levels of pyroptosis, attenuation of inflammation, and prevention of the fibrotic remodeling that often accompanies progressive CKD (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). In vivo, these effects are anticipated to manifest as decreased proteinuria, improved kidney function markers, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, and lower extracellular matrix deposition. This translates into a reduction in renal interstitial fibrosis and a preservation of normal tubular architecture, thereby ameliorating the progressive decline in renal function seen in CKD models. The expression profile of NLRP3 in TECs, coupled with its established role in mediating inflammatory and fibrotic responses, provides a solid rationale for targeting NLRP3 in chronic kidney disease (Zhang et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). The proposed mechanism is in alignment with the pathological features of CKD, where sustained low-grade inflammation and fibrosis lead to irreversible kidney damage.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nMCC950 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease due to several compelling strengths. First, its rational design as a selective NLRP3 inhibitor ensures that it directly targets a critical inflammatory pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of CKD. The extensive preclinical evidence in diverse animal models—from diabetic nephropathy to salt-sensitive hypertension and adenine-induced renal failure—strongly supports its renoprotective effects, including reductions in proteinuria, improved renal function, and diminished fibrotic remodeling (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Sabra et al., 2023). Second, the detailed elucidation of its molecular mechanism—confirming binding to the Walker B motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ATP hydrolysis—provides a clear mechanistic rationale that is essential for translational development (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Third, its favorable pharmacological properties, including oral bioavailability and a safety profile established in non-human primates, further underline its developmental feasibility (Kaur et al., 2025; ClinicalTrials.gov).  \n\nHowever, there are some potential weaknesses that must be carefully considered. Although rodent models have provided robust efficacy data, the translation of these effects to humans remains to be fully validated. There is a paucity of comprehensive clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with MCC950, which introduces uncertainty regarding its efficacy and potential off-target effects in a human patient population. Additionally, while the compound is highly selective for the NLRP3 inflammasome, it is critical to further elucidate its long-term safety and impact on global immune function, given the essential role of inflammasomes in host defense. In some experimental contexts, there has been variability in the inhibition of inflammation and fibrosis depending on the specific disease model, suggesting that its therapeutic window may differ based on disease etiology (Sabra et al., 2023). Despite these challenges, the overall evidence supports the further development of MCC950 as a mechanistic intervention in CKD, particularly in settings where inflammasome-driven pathology is predominant.\n\nIn summary, MCC950 is a well-characterized, rationally designed NLRP3 inhibitor with strong preclinical evidence demonstrating its renoprotective effects in various models of chronic kidney disease. Its specific binding to the Walker B motif of the NLRP3 NACHT domain and subsequent inhibition of ATP hydrolysis form the basis of its mechanism, reducing caspase-1 activation, IL-1β/IL-18 maturation, and gasdermin-D-mediated pyroptosis. These actions are expected to translate into reduced tubular epithelial cell death, diminished interstitial inflammation, and alleviation of fibrotic remodeling—key pathological processes in CKD progression. While further clinical validation is necessary, the strengths in mechanistic rationale, preclinical efficacy data, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties position MCC950 as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Coll et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022).\n\nReferences  \nColl, R.

"(OLT1177, 8)","(INF4E, 4)","Both candidates target the NLRP3 inflammasome, a well‐validated driver of inflammation and fibrosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Candidate 1, INF4E (ID 4), is an acrylate‐based covalent inhibitor that irreversibly binds the NACHT domain’s ATP‐binding site. Its preclinical data are robust in sepsis and inflammatory bowel disease models, and it demonstrates submicromolar potency and oral exposure in rodents. However, no direct CKD or renal fibrosis studies exist, and covalent inhibitors carry an elevated risk of off‐target cytotoxicity, especially in already vulnerable hypoxic tubular cells. Candidate 2, OLT1177 (dapansutrile; ID 8), is a β‐sulfonyl nitrile small molecule developed explicitly for NLRP3 inhibition. It has advanced into Phase I/II human trials—demonstrating an excellent safety profile at up to 1,000 mg/day—and has preclinical efficacy in crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy models, showing reduced renal IL-1β, macrophage infiltration, and fibrosis markers. Its reversible, selective engagement of the NACHT domain (blocking ASC recruitment) offers sustained target engagement without the liabilities of covalent Michael acceptors. OLT1177’s oral bioavailability and metabolic stability support chronic dosing, and its safety has been established in humans. Although neither has been tested directly in CKD patients, OLT1177’s translational data, human safety, and kidney‐specific animal models give it a clear edge over INF4E, whose efficacy in CKD is purely hypothetical and whose irreversible mechanism poses greater risk.","OLT1177 (ID 8) outperforms INF4E (ID 4) across the highest‐priority criteria. OLT1177 has direct preclinical evidence in CKD‐relevant models, a well‐characterized, selective mechanism of action, and clinical safety data in humans, making it far more likely to succeed experimentally and translate into a viable therapy. INF4E, while mechanistically sound and potent, lacks any CKD‐focused studies, carries a higher risk of off‐target toxicity due to its irreversible covalent binding, and has no human safety data. These factors combine to make OLT1177 the superior candidate for further development in CKD.",3,"(4, 8)","{'hypothesis': 'INF4E (Tocris, catalog #5903)', 'answer': 'Proposal for INF4E (Tocris, catalog #5903)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nINF4E is a synthetic electrophilic small‐molecule inhibitor that was initially discovered through phenotypic screening in macrophage models testing for NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. It is an acrylate derivative belonging to a class of compounds that harness α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl (Michael acceptor) functionalities to achieve covalent, irreversible inhibition of target proteins. Its discovery emerged during screening campaigns that looked for submicromolar potency against NLRP3, with subsequent chemical optimization to balance reactivity and cytotoxicity. Specifically, INF4E (also referred to in some studies as compound 9) was identified for its ability to selectively inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation by binding covalently to the NACHT domain’s ATP‐binding site, thereby interfering with ATP hydrolysis required for the conformational changes that lead to inflammasome assembly (Cocco et al., 2017; Blevins et al., 2022). As a member of the acrylate derivatives class, similar compounds have been explored in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular disorders, where targeting NLRP3 has shown promise. Members of this chemical class have a well‐documented history of being used as selective covalent modifiers with potential in modulating inflammatory signaling cascades.  \n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of INF4E and its related chemical family primarily stems from preclinical studies where they have been shown to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in various models of inflammation. INF4E was originally validated in sepsis models, demonstrating efficacy in reducing systemic inflammation, and subsequent studies extended its utility to show anti‐pyroptotic effects in macrophage cell lines with submicromolar potency. Moreover, related acrylate derivatives have been explored in inflammatory bowel disease models, where modifications to reduce cytotoxicity led to the generation of analogues such as INF39. Although the preclinical literature for this class of inhibitors is robust in the context of sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, and even in models of ischemic injury in the heart, there is no direct literature evidence that INF4E has been specifically used for treating chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis. Searches in Clinical Trials databases for “NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have revealed only nascent clinical exploration of NLRP3 inhibitors in renal disease, with most candidates like MCC950 and OLT1177 being at early development stages (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023). Thus, while INF4E’s mechanism of NLRP3 inhibition is highly relevant to inflammatory processes, its therapeutic history in kidney disease remains limited to preclinical mechanistic rationale rather than established clinical or veterinary use in CKD.  \n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, INF4E exerts its action by covalently binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, specifically targeting its ATP‐binding site. The NACHT domain is essential for NLRP3 oligomerization and subsequent inflammasome assembly. INF4E’s acrylate (Michael acceptor) moiety reacts with cysteine residues present in this domain, thereby irreversibly blocking ATP hydrolysis. The inhibition of ATP hydrolysis interferes directly with the required conformational changes that transform NLRP3 from an inactive to an active state capable of recruiting the adaptor protein ASC and procaspase‐1. Consequently, the subsequent cleavage of caspase‐1 is prevented, which in turn stops the maturation and release of key pro‐inflammatory cytokines, notably IL‐1β and IL‐18 (Mezzaroma et al., 2021; Cocco et al., 2017).  \nThis covalent binding mechanism is particularly significant because it offers prolonged inhibitory effects owing to its irreversible nature. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, where hypoxia serves as a potent priming signal for inflammasome activation and contributes to chronic inflammation and fibrosis, inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E is hypothesized to prevent the cascade leading to caspase‐1 activation, thus mitigating caspase‐1–dependent pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death—and reducing the release of IL‐18 (Blevins et al., 2022; Komada & Muruve, 2019).  \nThe biochemical interactions of INF4E align with the known structure–activity relationships of electrophilic acrylate derivatives, as these compounds are designed to target the ATPase activity of NLRP3. By interfering with this enzymatic function, INF4E halts the nucleation of the inflammasome complex, thereby curtailing downstream signaling that ultimately leads to pyroptosis and fibrogenesis. The short-lived yet potent irreversible binding is a hallmark of this class of inhibitors, which has been exploited in several preclinical studies to provide a potent blockade of inflammation (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the context of the proposed assay and the underlying pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease, INF4E is anticipated to exhibit a therapeutic effect by mitigating hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation in proximal tubular epithelial cells. Hypoxic conditions are known to prime and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in these cells, and this process is a major contributor to tubular cell injury, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenic signaling—all key drivers of CKD progression.  \nThe expected outcome when applying INF4E would be a significant reduction in ATP hydrolysis that is crucial for NLRP3 activation, thereby preventing the subsequent assembly of the inflammasome complex. This inhibition should lead to a decrease in caspase‐1 activity, ultimately lowering the maturation and secretion of IL‐18 (and possibly IL‐1β). Reduced levels of IL‐18 would then limit the inflammatory and fibrogenic signaling cascades that promote the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis. In assays using hypoxic proximal tubular cells, one would therefore predict reduced markers of pyroptosis, improved cell viability, and a lower expression of fibrogenic proteins such as TGF-β and α-SMA.  \nThere is also supportive evidence that NLRP3 is expressed in proximal tubular cells and that its activation is directly linked to inflammatory responses and fibrosis under hypoxic conditions (Ochoa et al., 2023; Komada & Muruve, 2019). The selective inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E should thus translate into improved cellular integrity and a mitigated progression of the inflammatory milieu that typifies CKD. This expected modulation of pyroptosis and fibrosis markers provides a clear biochemical rationale for using INF4E as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic therapeutic candidate in kidney disease models.  \n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe analysis of INF4E as a repurposed drug candidate for chronic kidney disease presents both promising and challenging aspects. One major strength of INF4E lies in its clearly defined mechanism of action; by targeting the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and interfering with ATP hydrolysis, INF4E offers a direct method to abrogate inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. This is particularly relevant in CKD, where hypoxia-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in proximal tubular cells is a key pathological event leading to pyroptosis, inflammation, and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019).  \nAnother strength is its proven submicromolar potency as demonstrated in phenotypic screens, along with a degree of oral bioavailability in rodent models that supports the feasibility of future in vivo investigations (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021). This potency, combined with its specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome, positions INF4E as a candidate with the potential to modulate inflammatory responses without broadly suppressing the entire immune system. Moreover, by specifically reducing IL-18 release, INF4E may offer advantages over broader anti-inflammatory approaches that risk impairing normal host defense mechanisms (Thomas et al., 2022).  \nA potential weakness, however, is the risk associated with irreversible covalent binding, which, while conferring prolonged effects, may also lead to off-target toxicity if the selectivity is not absolute. Some acrylate derivatives have been noted for cytotoxicity issues, and although chemical optimization—such as the development of related compounds like INF39—has been undertaken to alleviate these concerns, it remains a critical point for evaluation in renal cells that are already susceptible to injury under hypoxic conditions (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \nFurthermore, while the mechanistic rationale for targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in CKD is strong, the clinical translation of NLRP3 inhibitors has been slow. Currently, only limited clinical trial data are available for NLRP3 inhibitors in CKD, and the majority of evidence remains at the preclinical level (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023).  \nAnother consideration is that chronic kidney disease is a multifactorial condition wherein inflammasome activation is just one of several pathogenic processes, including metabolic dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and oxidative stress. Therefore, while INF4E may effectively block one critical pathway—namely, hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation—it might need to be combined with therapies targeting other aspects of CKD pathogenesis to achieve a comprehensive therapeutic effect (Unknown Reference; Mulay, 2019).  \nDespite these challenges, INF4E’s selectivity for a mechanistically validated target, its oral availability, and its demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory models provide a strong rationale for further investigation. In assays designed to model hypoxic tubular injury, INF4E is expected to reduce pyroptosis and fibrogenic signaling, thereby slowing CKD progression. The drug’s success in other inflammatory contexts, such as sepsis models, lends additional weight to its potential, although caution must be exercised when extrapolating these data to the complex microenvironment of the kidney (Blevins et al., 2022; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \n\nContinued research should focus on dosing optimization, safety profiling in kidney-specific models, and investigation of combination strategies that target both inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in CKD (Komada & Muruve, 2019; Mulay, 2019; Pagliaro & Penna, 2023; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nOverall, INF4E represents a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for chronic kidney disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, which aligns well with an established pathogenic pathway in CKD—namely, hypoxia-driven NLRP3 inflammasome activation in proximal tubular cells. Its ability to block the ATPase activity of NLRP3, thereby preventing both caspase-1 activation and IL-18 release, underpins a novel strategy aimed at mitigating pyroptosis and subsequent fibrogenic signaling cascades. While challenges such as potential off-target cytotoxicity, the need for extensive in vivo validation in CKD models, and integration into a multifactorial therapeutic approach remain, the compelling preclinical data for related compounds and the rigorous mechanistic underpinnings provide a strong basis for advancing INF4E in further preclinical studies and eventual clinical trials. Continued research should include detailed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological evaluations in renal models, as well as assessments of its efficacy in reducing markers of inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrosis in hypoxic proximal tubular cells. Given the complexity of CKD, INF4E may ultimately be best suited for combination therapy alongside agents addressing complementary pathogenic mechanisms. Overall, the potential strengths of INF4E—rooted in its selective, irreversible inhibition of a well‐validated molecular target—are balanced by the need for careful evaluation of safety and clinical translatability in the setting of chronic kidney disease (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nReferences:  \nBlevins, H.

The compound was synthesized via a chemically directed approach—in particular, its synthesis involved an alkylation reaction of sodium methanesulfinate with 3-bromopropionitrile, yielding a β-sulfonyl nitrile moiety that confers its inhibitory activity (Marchetti et al., 2018). This class of small molecule inhibitors has been widely explored for targeting inflammatory pathways through modulation of innate immune responses. Historically, β-sulfonyl nitrile compounds have attracted attention as therapeutic agents due to their capacity to engage key protein domains involved in inflammation while maintaining selectivity and oral bioavailability, attributes that are critical for chronic treatment regimens (Marchetti et al., 2018).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOLT1177 has progressed through several stages of development and clinical evaluation in diseases characterized by uncontrolled inflammation, notably in acute gout flares, heart failure, and conditions linked to cytokine release syndromes. In Phase I clinical trials, dapansutrile demonstrated an excellent safety profile when administered to healthy subjects at dosages up to 1000 mg per day for 8 days, thereby establishing its tolerability and preliminary evidence of target engagement (Jansen et al., 2019). Moreover, therapeutic evaluations in inflammatory settings—such as a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study in patients with NYHA II–III systolic heart failure—further underscored its favorable safety profile and pharmacodynamic effects despite the fact that current clinical investigations have not directly targeted Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) populations (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical studies in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy have demonstrated that treatment with OLT1177 leads to significant reductions in renal IL-1β levels, decreased macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis, suggesting that its benefits extend to kidney-related inflammatory damage (Mulay, 2019). Although clinical trials specifically focused on CKD or renal inflammation are lacking at this point, the robust anti-inflammatory effects observed in related models and conditions provide a sound rationale for repurposing OLT1177 in chronic kidney disease.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, OLT1177 selectively inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by targeting its central NACHT domain, where it interferes with ATPase activity that is critical for the oligomerization process necessary for inflammasome assembly. Under normal conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggers the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), leading to the formation of a multi-protein complex that activates caspase-1 and drives the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) (Kim et al., 2019). OLT1177 binds specifically to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, thereby blocking the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC, which is a necessary event for full inflammasome assembly (Marchetti et al., 2018). In doing so, it prevents the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-1 and effectively reduces the secretion of IL-1β. This mechanism is particularly significant in environments of hyperglycemic stress, where increased NLRP3 activity in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) drives inflammation, pyroptotic cell death, and subsequent tubulointerstitial fibrosis (Mulay, 2019). Additionally, by curtailing downstream cytokine release and pyroptosis, OLT1177 is believed to mitigate the metabolic cost of inflammation, an effect that has been observed in multiple preclinical in vivo studies in conditions ranging from acute arthritis to cardiac dysfunction (Jansen et al., 2019; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe central hypothesis is that through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, OLT1177 will effectively block the recruitment of ASC and disrupt subsequent caspase-1 activation in renal tubular cells, particularly under conditions of hyperglycemia which are common in diabetic nephropathy. Under hyperglycemic stress, renal tubular epithelial cells exhibit increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and aberrant inflammasome activation resulting in heightened secretion of IL-1β, a cytokine implicated in promoting fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition. By preventing the cleavage of pro-IL-1β into its active form, OLT1177 is expected to prevent pyroptotic cell death of TECs and interrupt the deleterious cycle of inflammation-driven fibrogenesis in the kidney (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Evidence from animal models indicates that selective blockade of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to a marked decrease in renal inflammation as evidenced by reduced macrophage infiltration and lower profibrotic cytokine levels, which supports the expectation that OLT1177 could yield appreciable renoprotective outcomes in CKD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In the proposed assay, it is anticipated that OLT1177 will reduce markers of inflammation such as IL-1β and IL-18 in the culture medium of hyperglycemia-stressed TECs, thereby correlating with decreased pyroptosis and improved cell viability. This would be further corroborated by downstream effects such as reduced activation of profibrotic pathways, including lower TGF-β signaling and diminished deposition of fibrotic markers, ultimately mitigating the progression toward renal fibrosis (Cliff, 2023; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate with substantial potential for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease owing to its well-characterized mechanism of action, favorable preclinical results, and established safety profile in early clinical studies. One of the major strengths of OLT1177 lies in its selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an attractive target given the critical role of NLRP3 in mediating renal inflammation, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenesis. Its synthetic origins and robust medicinal chemistry underpin its precise targeting of the NACHT domain in NLRP3, effectively sparing other inflammasomes and reducing the risk of broad immunosuppression (Marchetti et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Furthermore, its oral bioavailability and metabolic stability make it suitable for chronic administration, an essential consideration for CKD where long-term therapy is required (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nFrom a therapeutic history perspective, although OLT1177 has not yet been directly tested in human CKD patient populations, its successful progression through Phase I trials for conditions such as gout and heart failure, combined with promising data in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy, strongly supports its potential utility in renal settings (Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Preclinical studies show reduced renal IL-1β secretion, diminished macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis when NLRP3 is inhibited by agents like OLT1177, lending biological credence to the hypothesis that inflammasome inhibition could slow CKD progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nAt the molecular level, the precise action of OLT1177—binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ASC recruitment—represents a highly targeted approach that contrasts with cytokine-neutralizing therapies such as anti-IL-1β antibodies. This specificity is advantageous because it not only prevents the generation of IL-1β but also curtails the activation of NFκB and other downstream inflammatory cascades, potentially reducing off-target effects and preserving broader immune competence (Marchetti et al., 2018; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020). Additionally, the expected anti-inflammatory effects in renal tubular cells—specifically preventing pyroptosis and fibrogenesis—are consistent with literature demonstrating that NLRP3 is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells under hyperglycemic and inflammatory stress (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain. One of the limitations stems from the current lack of direct clinical evidence in CKD populations; while animal models provide a strong rationale, the translation of these findings into human CKD may be complicated by the multifactorial nature of the disease, where multiple pathways contribute to renal injury beyond inflammasome activation. Additionally, the chronic nature of CKD necessitates prolonged administration of therapeutic agents, and long-term safety data for OLT1177 in such a setting are still pending. There is also the possibility that inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome might impair necessary innate immune responses, although the specificity of OLT1177 for the NLRP3 complex—in contrast to more generalized anti-inflammatory agents—should, in theory, mitigate this concern (Seok et al., 2021).\n\nMoreover, while the preclinical data in models of diabetic nephropathy and crystal-induced kidney injury are promising, variability in genetic and environmental factors in human CKD could affect the compound’s efficacy. It will therefore be critical to design dedicated clinical trials in defined CKD populations, ideally incorporating biomarkers of inflammasome activity, such as circulating IL-1β and IL-18 levels, as well as imaging and functional assessments of renal fibrosis and function. The anti-fibrotic effects, in particular, warrant closer mechanistic studies to confirm that inhibition of TEC pyroptosis and preservation of tubular integrity occur in the human kidney as they do in animal models (Williams et al., 2022; Cliff, 2023).\n\nIn conclusion, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) represents a compelling candidate for repurposing in Chronic Kidney Disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, favorable pharmacological profile, and preclinical evidence supporting its renoprotective effects. Its ability to directly inhibit the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding to the NACHT domain and blocking ASC recruitment addresses a critical upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that leads to caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and subsequent pyroptosis of renal tubular cells. This mode of action has the potential to attenuate the inflammation-driven fibrogenesis that is central to CKD progression, particularly in diabetic nephropathy where hyperglycemic stress is a key driver of renal injury.\n\nStrengths of OLT1177 include its synthetic origin allowing for structural optimization, its demonstrated safety in Phase I clinical trials, its oral bioavailability which is advantageous for chronic therapy, and its selective inhibitory action that minimizes off-target effects. Additionally, existing preclinical studies showing reduced renal IL-1β, diminished macrophage infiltration, and lowered fibrotic responses in models of nephropathy provide a promising foundation for further exploration in CKD (Mulay, 2019; Jansen et al., 2019).\n\nWeaknesses or challenges include the current absence of dedicated clinical trials in CKD, the complexity of CKD pathophysiology where multiple inflammatory and fibrotic pathways are involved, and the potential risk that chronic inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome could in some contexts compromise the host defense or alter essential cellular processes. These concerns underscore the need for carefully designed preclinical studies specifically in renal disease models, followed by early phase clinical trials in well-defined CKD populations to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and long-term safety.\n\nOverall, based on the comprehensive literature review, the mechanistic rationale, and the encouraging preclinical and early clinical data available, OLT1177 shows significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease. The next steps should involve further detailed studies in CKD-specific preclinical models that assess not only inflammatory cytokine modulation but also functional outcomes such as glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria reduction, and fibrosis attenuation. A robust clinical development program targeting patients with diabetic nephropathy and other forms of CKD characterized by inflammasome activation would be the logical progression to validate its clinical utility (Marchetti et al., 2018; Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nReferences  \nCliff, C.

"(OLT1177, 8)","(A-438079, 2)","Both candidates target inflammatory drivers of CKD via the NLRP3/IL-1β axis but differ in evidence depth, mechanism specificity, safety, and translational readiness. A-438079 (ID 2) is a potent, selective P2X7 antagonist with strong preclinical efficacy in acute kidney injury (cisplatin nephrotoxicity, sepsis models) and robust mechanistic data on blocking ATP-triggered NLRP3 activation. However, evidence in chronic disease models is indirect, species variability in P2X7 biology raises translational risk, and no clinical safety data in humans exist. In contrast, OLT1177 (dapansutrile; ID 8) directly targets the NLRP3 inflammasome NACHT domain, blocking oligomerization and caspase-1 activation. It has demonstrated renoprotective effects in preclinical diabetic and crystal nephropathy models, plus an established Phase I safety and PK profile in humans (oral bioavailability, up to 1,000 mg/day). Its mechanism is more proximal to inflammasome assembly and less susceptible to pathway redundancy than P2X7 blockade. The feasibility of chronic administration, defined biomarkers of target engagement, and detailed medicinal chemistry support further development. Although direct CKD trials are pending, OLT1177’s human safety data, oral chronic dosing suitability, and broader preclinical evidence in renal contexts outweigh A-438079’s more limited chronic data. OLT1177 also avoids potential compensatory ATP-receptor pathways and shows high specificity with minimal immunosuppression risk beyond NLRP3.","OLT1177 (ID 8) is preferred over A-438079 (ID 2) because it directly and specifically inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome, a central driver of CKD inflammation and fibrosis, has proven safety and PK in humans, and demonstrated efficacy in relevant nephropathy models. A-438079, while potent in acute models, faces translational uncertainties due to species variability, lack of clinical data, and indirect mechanism susceptible to redundancy. OLT1177’s clinical readiness, oral dosing feasibility, and proximity to core CKD pathology give it a higher probability of successful translation.",4,"(2, 8)","{'hypothesis': 'A-438079 (Tocris, catalog #2947)', 'answer': 'Proposal for A-438079 (Tocris, catalog #2947)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nA-438079 is a synthetic small‐molecule antagonist originally developed as a selective inhibitor of the P2X7 receptor, a ligand‐gated ion channel known to be activated by high concentrations of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The compound belongs to a class of agents that includes disubstituted tetrazoles and cyanoguanidine derivatives, which have been characterized by their ability to selectively block P2X7 receptor activation without significantly affecting other P2X subtypes. Its design and synthesis were initially achieved by pharmaceutical research groups (notably Abbott Laboratories as indicated in early publications) and have since been commercialized by companies such as Tocris (catalog #2947). This class of compounds was originally optimized for studies in inflammatory processes and pain models, as they inhibit ATP‐induced ion flux such as calcium influx and potassium efflux, a key factor in the activation cascade of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nBiochemically and pharmacologically, A-438079 has been investigated in various preclinical models for its ability to mitigate inflammation. It has demonstrated efficacy in rodent models of neuropathic pain and inflammatory conditions by inhibiting P2X7-mediated IL-1β release. In terms of renal applications, there is evidence from several studies that selective P2X7 antagonism can protect against kidney insults such as ischemia-reperfusion injury and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. For example, Zhang et al. (2014) showed that blocking P2X7 with antagonists like A-438079 attenuated cisplatin-induced renal tubular damage by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis markers in mice (Zhang et al., 2014). Additionally, studies such as those by Arulkumaran (2016) and colleagues have demonstrated that while genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of P2X7 in some models does not always equate to improved renal function, the block of P2X7-related signaling reduces inflammasome activation and cytokine release in immune cells and tubular epithelium (Arulkumaran, 2016; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Even though A-438079 has not been widely tested clinically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), its pharmacological profile as a P2X7 antagonist has been well characterized in biochemical studies and preclinical kidney injury models. This builds an indirect but strong rationale for repurposing it in CKD contexts, where sustained inflammation and fibrosis are major pathogenic drivers (Birch et al., 2013; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe primary mechanism of A-438079 is its high-affinity, selective antagonism of the P2X7 receptor. The P2X7 receptor is unique among the P2X family in its requirement for high concentrations of ATP, which are typically achieved in pathological conditions involving cell injury and inflammation. Under normal conditions, extracellular ATP levels are low; however, during tissue damage, ATP is released into the extracellular space where it binds to and activates P2X7 receptors expressed on immune cells (especially macrophages) and renal tubular epithelial cells (Han et al., 2020; Howarth, 2020).  \n\nUpon binding of ATP to the receptor, P2X7 undergoes a conformational change that opens its ion channel, permitting the influx of calcium ions and the efflux of potassium ions. This potassium efflux is a critical upstream event that triggers the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex responsible for activating caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 then cleaves the precursors of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature, secreted forms. These cytokines play major roles in propagating inflammatory signals, inducing pyroptosis (a form of inflammatory cell death), and promoting fibrotic remodeling in affected tissues (Qian et al., 2021; Shokoples, 2022).\n\nA-438079 interacts with the P2X7 receptor by competitively inhibiting ATP binding, thereby preventing the channel’s conformational change and subsequent ion flux. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) is approximately 40 nM in rodent models, indicating high potency (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). By blocking this pathway, A-438079 inhibits downstream events including NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 cleavage, and the release of IL-1β, ultimately reducing inflammatory responses and preventing the activation of fibrotic signaling pathways in kidney tissue, particularly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells where P2X7 and NLRP3 are highly expressed (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the context of chronic kidney disease, the principal pathological mechanisms include persistent inflammation and fibrosis, processes that are significantly driven by inflammasome activation in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. The hypothesis postulates that A-438079 will block ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor in these cell types. By doing so, it prevents the crucial potassium efflux that is necessary for the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The expected downstream effects include a reduction in caspase-1 activation, decreased cleavage of pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β, and ultimately lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This chain of events is anticipated to reduce pyroptosis and curb the progression of fibrosis within the kidney (Qian et al., 2021; Arulkumaran et al., 2018).\n\nRenal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells are known to express both the P2X7 receptor and NLRP3, as evidenced by various studies outlining their roles in mediating inflammation-driven fibrosis in CKD (Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020). In assays, it is expected that treatment with A-438079 would result in a measurable decrease in IL-1β release, reduced markers of inflammation such as caspase-1 activity, and potentially lower expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components. Furthermore, by blunting chronic inflammatory responses, A-438079 may help to preserve kidney structure and function, thereby slowing the progression of CKD. The compound’s favorable pharmacokinetic properties—particularly its demonstrated bioavailability and minimal off-target effects—support the feasibility of achieving these outcomes (Burnstock, 2017).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nA-438079 presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on several factors. One of its major strengths lies in its selectivity and potency as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, which allows it to precisely target an upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that is centrally implicated in CKD. The ability of A-438079 to block ATP-induced ion flux is particularly compelling because it interrupts the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a known driver of IL-1β and IL-18 release in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells (Arulkumaran, 2016; Qian et al., 2021). This molecular specificity holds promise for reducing inflammation and subsequent fibrotic formation in the kidney, both of which are critical elements in CKD progression.\n\nThe preclinical evidence supporting the use of P2X7 antagonists in models of acute kidney injury, such as cisplatin nephrotoxicity and sepsis-induced renal injury, provides additional rationale, even though such models are not perfect surrogates for CKD (Zhang et al., 2014; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Some studies have demonstrated that selective P2X7 blockade can attenuate inflammatory cytokine production, improve renal function markers, and reduce cell death, thereby supporting the hypothesis that similar benefits could be realized in chronic inflammatory settings like CKD (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nAdditionally, the mechanistic details of P2X7 receptor signaling – requiring high extracellular ATP concentrations, initiating K+ efflux, and triggering inflammasome assembly – align closely with the known processes of renal inflammation and fibrosis. The fact that P2X7 and NLRP3 are co-expressed in key renal cell populations reinforces the logic behind using A-438079 to target these pathways (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and potential challenges that need to be considered. Firstly, in some preclinical models, especially in certain rat strains (as noted by studies involving P2X7 receptor knockout rats), the inhibition or deletion of P2X7 did not significantly alter renal function or prevent kidney injury induced by hypertensive factors such as angiotensin II (Nespoux et al., 2024). This suggests that compensatory pathways may exist, and the role of P2X7 might be context-dependent or vary among species. Secondly, clinical trials of P2X7 antagonists in other inflammatory diseases have had mixed outcomes, raising concerns about translational efficacy in human CKD (Luz et al., 2019). Moreover, while the mechanism of inflammasome inhibition is well understood in vitro, the in vivo pharmacodynamics in the kidney may be complicated by variable local ATP concentrations and the dynamic expression of the receptor in disease states.\n\nFrom a drug development standpoint, the potency (IC50 ~40 nM) and reported good bioavailability of A-438079 are advantageous. Its minimal off-target effects also reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions in clinical translation. However, more robust and specific data in CKD models are necessary to establish whether the attenuation of IL-1β release can consistently translate into meaningful improvements in renal fibrosis and overall kidney function over long-term treatment courses (Chen et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2024).\n\nIn summary, A-438079’s targeted inhibition of the P2X7 receptor offers a novel approach to halt the ATP-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby mitigating a key upstream trigger of inflammatory cascades in CKD. Its preclinical track record in inflammatory and renal injury models, combined with its mechanistic specificity, positions it as a strong candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease. Nonetheless, species variability, redundant inflammatory pathways, and the need for further in vivo validation in models of long-term kidney disease remain potential hurdles. If these challenges are addressed in further preclinical and early clinical studies, A-438079 could represent a significant advance in targeting the inflammation-fibrosis axis in CKD (Arulkumaran et al., 2018; Fantauzzi, 2013; Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe strengths of A-438079 for CKD include its high potency, selectivity, and well-elucidated mechanism of action in blocking ATP-induced P2X7 receptor activation—a critical initiator of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. These molecular interactions have been robustly characterized in multiple preclinical studies, indicating that the drug may effectively reduce IL-1β-mediated inflammation and subsequent fibrotic responses. In models of acute renal injury, antagonizing P2X7 has led to reduced cell death and improved renal function, which supports its potential usage in CKD where chronic inflammation is a driver of progressive fibrosis. Moreover, the chemical class to which A-438079 belongs has been extensively employed in studies of inflammatory diseases, reinforcing the feasibility of this approach (Deplano, 2012; Qian et al., 2021).\n\nConversely, potential weaknesses lie in the heterogeneity of experimental outcomes across different preclinical models and species. Some studies have shown that genetic deletion of P2X7 in rats does not always confer renal protection in induced kidney injury, suggesting that the pathophysiology in certain species—or even specific CKD etiologies—may be driven by redundant pathways beyond P2X7/NLRP3. In addition, although A-438079 demonstrates promising in vitro efficacy, there remains a critical need for long-term in vivo studies specifically in CKD models to verify that its anti-inflammatory effects translate into clinically meaningful outcomes in terms of preservation of renal function and reduction in fibrosis. Lastly, it is important to consider potential compensatory mechanisms in chronic inflammation that may limit the sole efficacy of P2X7 inhibition (Nespoux et al., 2024; Luz et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, A-438079 is a scientifically compelling therapeutic candidate for CKD, with robust mechanistic support and significant preclinical evidence in inflammatory models. Its ability to target the P2X7/NLRP3 axis addresses a novel therapeutic area in CKD by potentially halting the progression of inflammation-driven fibrosis. However, potential limitations due to species-specific responses and redundancy in inflammatory signaling must be carefully evaluated in future studies. Overall, A-438079 merits further investigation as part of a multi-pronged approach to modulate inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in chronic kidney disease (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:  \nArulkumaran, N.

The compound was synthesized via a chemically directed approach—in particular, its synthesis involved an alkylation reaction of sodium methanesulfinate with 3-bromopropionitrile, yielding a β-sulfonyl nitrile moiety that confers its inhibitory activity (Marchetti et al., 2018). This class of small molecule inhibitors has been widely explored for targeting inflammatory pathways through modulation of innate immune responses. Historically, β-sulfonyl nitrile compounds have attracted attention as therapeutic agents due to their capacity to engage key protein domains involved in inflammation while maintaining selectivity and oral bioavailability, attributes that are critical for chronic treatment regimens (Marchetti et al., 2018).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOLT1177 has progressed through several stages of development and clinical evaluation in diseases characterized by uncontrolled inflammation, notably in acute gout flares, heart failure, and conditions linked to cytokine release syndromes. In Phase I clinical trials, dapansutrile demonstrated an excellent safety profile when administered to healthy subjects at dosages up to 1000 mg per day for 8 days, thereby establishing its tolerability and preliminary evidence of target engagement (Jansen et al., 2019). Moreover, therapeutic evaluations in inflammatory settings—such as a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study in patients with NYHA II–III systolic heart failure—further underscored its favorable safety profile and pharmacodynamic effects despite the fact that current clinical investigations have not directly targeted Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) populations (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical studies in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy have demonstrated that treatment with OLT1177 leads to significant reductions in renal IL-1β levels, decreased macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis, suggesting that its benefits extend to kidney-related inflammatory damage (Mulay, 2019). Although clinical trials specifically focused on CKD or renal inflammation are lacking at this point, the robust anti-inflammatory effects observed in related models and conditions provide a sound rationale for repurposing OLT1177 in chronic kidney disease.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, OLT1177 selectively inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by targeting its central NACHT domain, where it interferes with ATPase activity that is critical for the oligomerization process necessary for inflammasome assembly. Under normal conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggers the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), leading to the formation of a multi-protein complex that activates caspase-1 and drives the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) (Kim et al., 2019). OLT1177 binds specifically to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, thereby blocking the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC, which is a necessary event for full inflammasome assembly (Marchetti et al., 2018). In doing so, it prevents the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-1 and effectively reduces the secretion of IL-1β. This mechanism is particularly significant in environments of hyperglycemic stress, where increased NLRP3 activity in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) drives inflammation, pyroptotic cell death, and subsequent tubulointerstitial fibrosis (Mulay, 2019). Additionally, by curtailing downstream cytokine release and pyroptosis, OLT1177 is believed to mitigate the metabolic cost of inflammation, an effect that has been observed in multiple preclinical in vivo studies in conditions ranging from acute arthritis to cardiac dysfunction (Jansen et al., 2019; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe central hypothesis is that through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, OLT1177 will effectively block the recruitment of ASC and disrupt subsequent caspase-1 activation in renal tubular cells, particularly under conditions of hyperglycemia which are common in diabetic nephropathy. Under hyperglycemic stress, renal tubular epithelial cells exhibit increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and aberrant inflammasome activation resulting in heightened secretion of IL-1β, a cytokine implicated in promoting fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition. By preventing the cleavage of pro-IL-1β into its active form, OLT1177 is expected to prevent pyroptotic cell death of TECs and interrupt the deleterious cycle of inflammation-driven fibrogenesis in the kidney (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Evidence from animal models indicates that selective blockade of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to a marked decrease in renal inflammation as evidenced by reduced macrophage infiltration and lower profibrotic cytokine levels, which supports the expectation that OLT1177 could yield appreciable renoprotective outcomes in CKD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In the proposed assay, it is anticipated that OLT1177 will reduce markers of inflammation such as IL-1β and IL-18 in the culture medium of hyperglycemia-stressed TECs, thereby correlating with decreased pyroptosis and improved cell viability. This would be further corroborated by downstream effects such as reduced activation of profibrotic pathways, including lower TGF-β signaling and diminished deposition of fibrotic markers, ultimately mitigating the progression toward renal fibrosis (Cliff, 2023; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate with substantial potential for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease owing to its well-characterized mechanism of action, favorable preclinical results, and established safety profile in early clinical studies. One of the major strengths of OLT1177 lies in its selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an attractive target given the critical role of NLRP3 in mediating renal inflammation, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenesis. Its synthetic origins and robust medicinal chemistry underpin its precise targeting of the NACHT domain in NLRP3, effectively sparing other inflammasomes and reducing the risk of broad immunosuppression (Marchetti et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Furthermore, its oral bioavailability and metabolic stability make it suitable for chronic administration, an essential consideration for CKD where long-term therapy is required (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nFrom a therapeutic history perspective, although OLT1177 has not yet been directly tested in human CKD patient populations, its successful progression through Phase I trials for conditions such as gout and heart failure, combined with promising data in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy, strongly supports its potential utility in renal settings (Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Preclinical studies show reduced renal IL-1β secretion, diminished macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis when NLRP3 is inhibited by agents like OLT1177, lending biological credence to the hypothesis that inflammasome inhibition could slow CKD progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nAt the molecular level, the precise action of OLT1177—binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ASC recruitment—represents a highly targeted approach that contrasts with cytokine-neutralizing therapies such as anti-IL-1β antibodies. This specificity is advantageous because it not only prevents the generation of IL-1β but also curtails the activation of NFκB and other downstream inflammatory cascades, potentially reducing off-target effects and preserving broader immune competence (Marchetti et al., 2018; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020). Additionally, the expected anti-inflammatory effects in renal tubular cells—specifically preventing pyroptosis and fibrogenesis—are consistent with literature demonstrating that NLRP3 is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells under hyperglycemic and inflammatory stress (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain. One of the limitations stems from the current lack of direct clinical evidence in CKD populations; while animal models provide a strong rationale, the translation of these findings into human CKD may be complicated by the multifactorial nature of the disease, where multiple pathways contribute to renal injury beyond inflammasome activation. Additionally, the chronic nature of CKD necessitates prolonged administration of therapeutic agents, and long-term safety data for OLT1177 in such a setting are still pending. There is also the possibility that inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome might impair necessary innate immune responses, although the specificity of OLT1177 for the NLRP3 complex—in contrast to more generalized anti-inflammatory agents—should, in theory, mitigate this concern (Seok et al., 2021).\n\nMoreover, while the preclinical data in models of diabetic nephropathy and crystal-induced kidney injury are promising, variability in genetic and environmental factors in human CKD could affect the compound’s efficacy. It will therefore be critical to design dedicated clinical trials in defined CKD populations, ideally incorporating biomarkers of inflammasome activity, such as circulating IL-1β and IL-18 levels, as well as imaging and functional assessments of renal fibrosis and function. The anti-fibrotic effects, in particular, warrant closer mechanistic studies to confirm that inhibition of TEC pyroptosis and preservation of tubular integrity occur in the human kidney as they do in animal models (Williams et al., 2022; Cliff, 2023).\n\nIn conclusion, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) represents a compelling candidate for repurposing in Chronic Kidney Disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, favorable pharmacological profile, and preclinical evidence supporting its renoprotective effects. Its ability to directly inhibit the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding to the NACHT domain and blocking ASC recruitment addresses a critical upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that leads to caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and subsequent pyroptosis of renal tubular cells. This mode of action has the potential to attenuate the inflammation-driven fibrogenesis that is central to CKD progression, particularly in diabetic nephropathy where hyperglycemic stress is a key driver of renal injury.\n\nStrengths of OLT1177 include its synthetic origin allowing for structural optimization, its demonstrated safety in Phase I clinical trials, its oral bioavailability which is advantageous for chronic therapy, and its selective inhibitory action that minimizes off-target effects. Additionally, existing preclinical studies showing reduced renal IL-1β, diminished macrophage infiltration, and lowered fibrotic responses in models of nephropathy provide a promising foundation for further exploration in CKD (Mulay, 2019; Jansen et al., 2019).\n\nWeaknesses or challenges include the current absence of dedicated clinical trials in CKD, the complexity of CKD pathophysiology where multiple inflammatory and fibrotic pathways are involved, and the potential risk that chronic inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome could in some contexts compromise the host defense or alter essential cellular processes. These concerns underscore the need for carefully designed preclinical studies specifically in renal disease models, followed by early phase clinical trials in well-defined CKD populations to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and long-term safety.\n\nOverall, based on the comprehensive literature review, the mechanistic rationale, and the encouraging preclinical and early clinical data available, OLT1177 shows significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease. The next steps should involve further detailed studies in CKD-specific preclinical models that assess not only inflammatory cytokine modulation but also functional outcomes such as glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria reduction, and fibrosis attenuation. A robust clinical development program targeting patients with diabetic nephropathy and other forms of CKD characterized by inflammasome activation would be the logical progression to validate its clinical utility (Marchetti et al., 2018; Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nReferences  \nCliff, C.

"(OLT1177, 8)","(Oridonin, 6)","Both candidates target NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, a well-validated mechanism in CKD pathology. Candidate 1 (Oridonin) is a natural diterpenoid with demonstrated covalent inhibition of NLRP3 via Cys279 binding and additional anti-inflammatory effects (NF-κB, p38-MAPK, Nrf2 activation). Preclinical rodent models (diabetic nephropathy, ischemia–reperfusion) show renoprotective effects, but direct evidence in podocytes is limited. Oridonin suffers from moderate potency, poor solubility, variable bioavailability, and a lack of clinical safety data in CKD. Candidate 2 (OLT1177, dapansutrile) is a synthetic β-sulfonyl nitrile with selective binding to the NLRP3 NACHT domain, blocking ASC recruitment. It has progressed through Phase I trials demonstrating safety and tolerability in humans, and preclinical models (crystal nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy) showing decreased IL-1β, macrophage infiltration, and fibrosis. OLT1177 offers clear mechanistic specificity, favorable oral bioavailability, metabolic stability, and an established safety profile. Both lack direct CKD clinical trials, but OLT1177’s advanced development stage, translational PK/PD data, and focused MoA present a higher likelihood of success and safety in CKD than the more pleiotropic and less optimized natural product, Oridonin.","OLT1177 is superior because it combines a highly specific, validated mechanism of NLRP3 inhibition with robust preclinical renoprotective data, established human safety, and favorable PK/PD properties suitable for chronic dosing.

As a kaurane-type diterpenoid, its structure comprises four isoprene units arranged into a characteristic tetracyclic skeleton, which is emblematic of this class of natural products. The compound’s discovery and development emerged from the long-standing tradition of using Rabdosia rubescens (also known as Donglingcao) in Asian folk medicine, where it was historically applied for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In the broader context of drug development, diterpenoids such as oridonin have been recognized for their “drug-like” properties; they have provided scaffolds for synthetic modifications aimed at improving potency, solubility, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Moreover, the extraction and study of oridonin reflect an important paradigm in natural products research, wherein historical use is validated and expanded upon with modern medicinal chemistry techniques. This compound, commercially available from suppliers like Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #O2015), fits well within the class of small-molecule natural products that have been repurposed for modern therapeutic applications in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases (Ding et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOridonin’s use spans a broad spectrum of therapeutic applications. Traditionally, the herbal preparations containing oridonin were employed in Chinese medicine to alleviate conditions ranging from pharyngitis and gingivitis to various inflammatory and tumorous conditions. With the advent of modern biochemical and pharmacological research, oridonin has been extensively studied for its anticancer efficacy; many preclinical studies have demonstrated its capacity to induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and suppress metastasis in a variety of cancer cell lines (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In addition to its anticancer properties, several studies have documented oridonin’s robust anti-inflammatory actions. Notably, oridonin has shown efficacy in experimental models of colitis and gout through its inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that mediates the maturation of IL-1β and is a critical driver of inflammatory responses (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020). Although most of the historical and ongoing research has emphasized oridonin’s anticancer and acute inflammatory indications, there is emerging interest in its potential role in renal pathologies. A search on ClinicalTrials.gov using terms such as “Oridonin AND kidney OR renal OR chronic kidney disease OR glomerulonephritis OR proteinuria OR glomerular” returned tens of thousands of trials, indicating significant research activity into natural products and potentially repurposed compounds for kidney diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, to date there is limited direct clinical evidence of oridonin being deployed specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preclinical studies, particularly those involving rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and ischemia–reperfusion injury, have demonstrated renoprotective effects such as reduced inflammatory cytokine levels, diminished fibrosis markers, and improved renal function parameters; these effects suggest that oridonin or its derivatives might be promising candidates for treating CKD or similar renal conditions (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, oridonin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects primarily through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex known to activate caspase-1 and mediate the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. Recent mechanistic studies have shown that oridonin covalently binds to cysteine 279 within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, a critical residue required for the ATPase activity of NLRP3 and its subsequent oligomerization (He et al., 2018). This binding effectively prevents the conformational changes necessary for the recruitment of NEK7, thereby halting inflammasome assembly and activation. In macrophages, this inhibition leads to a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and attenuates inflammatory cell recruitment—a mechanism that has been validated through pull‐down assays and mass spectrometry, which demonstrated nanomolar potency of oridonin in suppressing NLRP3 activation (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020).\n\nBeyond its direct interaction with the NLRP3 inflammasome, oridonin has been shown to modulate additional signaling pathways. For example, it can inhibit NF-κB and p38-MAPK activation, further blunting the inflammatory response, and it has been implicated in the activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidative defenses at lower concentrations, contributing to its cytoprotective effects (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019). These multifaceted actions underscore the polypharmacological nature of oridonin: while its primary mode of action appears to involve covalent modification of NLRP3, its downstream effects extend into a broader anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative network. This convergence on inflammatory signaling pathways is particularly relevant because overactivation of the inflammasome and subsequent pyroptotic cell death are implicated not only in acute inflammatory diseases but also in chronic fibrotic processes within the kidney (Ding et al., 2020).\n\nExpanding the context to renal pathology, the hypothesis driving our proposal is that human podocytes—which are essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier—express components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of NLRP3 in these cells has been linked to pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, which in turn contributes to podocyte loss, proteinuria, and interstitial fibrosis, all hallmarks of CKD. Although most direct evidence of oridonin’s NLRP3 inhibition comes from studies in immune cells like macrophages (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2016), the underlying mechanism is conserved across cell types. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that oridonin could similarly inhibit NLRP3 activation in podocytes, thereby preventing inflammasome assembly, blocking caspase-1 activation, and ultimately reducing the release of IL-1β (Li et al., 2021). By precluding these downstream events, oridonin may attenuate the cycle of inflammatory damage and fibrosis that underpins progressive renal injury in CKD (Li et al., 2021).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the proposed assays and eventual in vivo models of chronic kidney disease, the expected effect of oridonin centers on its ability to protect podocytes from NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated injury. More specifically, by covalently binding to cysteine 279 in NLRP3, oridonin is anticipated to inhibit ATP hydrolysis and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex. This mechanistic blockade should result in a reduction of caspase-1 activation—a key step in the maturation of IL-1β—and thereby diminish the secretion of this potent pro-inflammatory cytokine (He et al., 2018). In podocytes, such suppression is expected to reduce pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death that directly compromises the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and leads to proteinuria. Preservation of podocyte viability would, in turn, help maintain glomerular barrier integrity, minimizing the leakage of plasma proteins into the urine and limiting the ensuing fibrotic response in the renal interstitium (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nMoreover, the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB and p38-MAPK signaling pathways could provide additional benefits by reducing overall renal inflammation. In animal models of kidney injury—such as those induced by ischemia–reperfusion or diabetic nephropathy—treatment with compounds that inhibit these pathways has been correlated with improved renal function parameters (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021). Therefore, beyond its direct effect on podocyte inflammasome activity, oridonin may exert broader renoprotective actions by dampening inflammatory cascades that contribute to interstitial fibrosis and progressive renal insufficiency. In this context, oridonin’s oral bioavailability and established history in traditional medicine support the feasibility of translating these preclinical findings into clinical benefit for CKD patients (Su et al., 2024).\n\nIt is important to note that while direct evidence of oridonin’s effects on human podocytes remains to be fully elucidated, the expression of NLRP3 in podocytes has been demonstrated in experimental models of CKD. Additionally, studies involving natural products that inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome—such as fucoidan in diabetic kidney disease—have provided supportive mechanistic insights, suggesting that the targeting of inflammasome activation in podocytes is a viable therapeutic strategy (Wang et al., 2022).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nOverall, oridonin emerges as a compelling therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease, given its well-documented mechanism of inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome and its extensive background in modulating inflammatory pathways. Its natural origin and historical use in traditional Chinese medicine provide a robust basis for its safety profile, and preclinical studies have demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, including models of colitis, gout, and even acute kidney injury (Ding et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2021). Strengths of oridonin include its specificity for NLRP3 via covalent binding to a critical cysteine residue, which has been shown to yield nanomolar potency in relevant assays (He et al., 2018). Additionally, oridonin’s ability to modulate secondary pathways (NF-κB, p38-MAPK, and Nrf2) may amplify its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective benefits, addressing multiple facets of CKD pathophysiology ranging from podocyte loss to interstitial fibrosis (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nHowever, several weaknesses must also be considered. Despite promising preclinical data in other disease models, direct evidence for oridonin’s efficacy in modulating NLRP3 activation specifically in podocytes remains limited. Most mechanistic studies have been conducted in macrophages or other cell types, and while the extrapolation is reasonable given the conserved nature of inflammasome signaling, dedicated studies using human podocytes are needed to substantiate the proposed protective effects on proteinuria and interstitial fibrosis (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Furthermore, issues such as moderate potency, limited solubility, and variable bioavailability have been noted with oridonin, necessitating further formulation and structural optimization to ensure therapeutic efficacy in a clinical setting (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). These pharmacokinetic considerations are particularly critical for a chronic indication like CKD, where long-term dosing and sustained target engagement are required.\n\nAnother consideration is the translation of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects observed in acute injury models or non-renal tissue into the context of chronic kidney disease, which involves complex and multifactorial pathophysiology. Although the suppression of inflammasome-driven pyroptosis is a promising target for preventing podocyte injury, CKD progression involves additional factors such as hemodynamic stress, metabolic derangements, and immune dysregulation that may not be fully addressed by NLRP3 inhibition alone (Huang et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2020). Consequently, while the mechanistic specificity of oridonin is appealing, its efficacy in a multifaceted chronic disease state like CKD requires rigorous preclinical validation followed by carefully designed clinical trials.\n\nIn summary, oridonin holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease based on its robust anti-inflammatory mechanism, particularly its ability to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome via covalent binding to cysteine 279. The compound’s multifaceted mechanism—encompassing inhibition of caspase-1 activation, IL-1β maturation, and subsequent pyroptosis—could translate into preservation of podocyte integrity, reduction in proteinuria, and attenuation of interstitial fibrosis, all of which are critical endpoints in CKD management (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Nonetheless, challenges related to drug solubility, bioavailability, and the direct demonstration of efficacy in podocytes must be addressed. Given its strong preclinical validation in other inflammatory conditions, further targeted studies focusing on its renal effects and optimization of drug-like properties are warranted before it can be advanced as a viable treatment for CKD (Tan et al., 2021; Su et al., 2024). Overall, while there is a clear mechanistic rationale supporting the therapeutic potential of oridonin in CKD, additional studies specifically assessing its effects in relevant renal cell types and chronic disease models will be critical to fully validate its clinical utility.\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

The compound was synthesized via a chemically directed approach—in particular, its synthesis involved an alkylation reaction of sodium methanesulfinate with 3-bromopropionitrile, yielding a β-sulfonyl nitrile moiety that confers its inhibitory activity (Marchetti et al., 2018). This class of small molecule inhibitors has been widely explored for targeting inflammatory pathways through modulation of innate immune responses. Historically, β-sulfonyl nitrile compounds have attracted attention as therapeutic agents due to their capacity to engage key protein domains involved in inflammation while maintaining selectivity and oral bioavailability, attributes that are critical for chronic treatment regimens (Marchetti et al., 2018).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOLT1177 has progressed through several stages of development and clinical evaluation in diseases characterized by uncontrolled inflammation, notably in acute gout flares, heart failure, and conditions linked to cytokine release syndromes. In Phase I clinical trials, dapansutrile demonstrated an excellent safety profile when administered to healthy subjects at dosages up to 1000 mg per day for 8 days, thereby establishing its tolerability and preliminary evidence of target engagement (Jansen et al., 2019). Moreover, therapeutic evaluations in inflammatory settings—such as a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study in patients with NYHA II–III systolic heart failure—further underscored its favorable safety profile and pharmacodynamic effects despite the fact that current clinical investigations have not directly targeted Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) populations (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical studies in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy have demonstrated that treatment with OLT1177 leads to significant reductions in renal IL-1β levels, decreased macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis, suggesting that its benefits extend to kidney-related inflammatory damage (Mulay, 2019). Although clinical trials specifically focused on CKD or renal inflammation are lacking at this point, the robust anti-inflammatory effects observed in related models and conditions provide a sound rationale for repurposing OLT1177 in chronic kidney disease.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, OLT1177 selectively inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by targeting its central NACHT domain, where it interferes with ATPase activity that is critical for the oligomerization process necessary for inflammasome assembly. Under normal conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggers the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), leading to the formation of a multi-protein complex that activates caspase-1 and drives the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) (Kim et al., 2019). OLT1177 binds specifically to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, thereby blocking the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC, which is a necessary event for full inflammasome assembly (Marchetti et al., 2018). In doing so, it prevents the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-1 and effectively reduces the secretion of IL-1β. This mechanism is particularly significant in environments of hyperglycemic stress, where increased NLRP3 activity in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) drives inflammation, pyroptotic cell death, and subsequent tubulointerstitial fibrosis (Mulay, 2019). Additionally, by curtailing downstream cytokine release and pyroptosis, OLT1177 is believed to mitigate the metabolic cost of inflammation, an effect that has been observed in multiple preclinical in vivo studies in conditions ranging from acute arthritis to cardiac dysfunction (Jansen et al., 2019; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe central hypothesis is that through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, OLT1177 will effectively block the recruitment of ASC and disrupt subsequent caspase-1 activation in renal tubular cells, particularly under conditions of hyperglycemia which are common in diabetic nephropathy. Under hyperglycemic stress, renal tubular epithelial cells exhibit increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and aberrant inflammasome activation resulting in heightened secretion of IL-1β, a cytokine implicated in promoting fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition. By preventing the cleavage of pro-IL-1β into its active form, OLT1177 is expected to prevent pyroptotic cell death of TECs and interrupt the deleterious cycle of inflammation-driven fibrogenesis in the kidney (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Evidence from animal models indicates that selective blockade of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to a marked decrease in renal inflammation as evidenced by reduced macrophage infiltration and lower profibrotic cytokine levels, which supports the expectation that OLT1177 could yield appreciable renoprotective outcomes in CKD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In the proposed assay, it is anticipated that OLT1177 will reduce markers of inflammation such as IL-1β and IL-18 in the culture medium of hyperglycemia-stressed TECs, thereby correlating with decreased pyroptosis and improved cell viability. This would be further corroborated by downstream effects such as reduced activation of profibrotic pathways, including lower TGF-β signaling and diminished deposition of fibrotic markers, ultimately mitigating the progression toward renal fibrosis (Cliff, 2023; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate with substantial potential for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease owing to its well-characterized mechanism of action, favorable preclinical results, and established safety profile in early clinical studies. One of the major strengths of OLT1177 lies in its selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an attractive target given the critical role of NLRP3 in mediating renal inflammation, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenesis. Its synthetic origins and robust medicinal chemistry underpin its precise targeting of the NACHT domain in NLRP3, effectively sparing other inflammasomes and reducing the risk of broad immunosuppression (Marchetti et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Furthermore, its oral bioavailability and metabolic stability make it suitable for chronic administration, an essential consideration for CKD where long-term therapy is required (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nFrom a therapeutic history perspective, although OLT1177 has not yet been directly tested in human CKD patient populations, its successful progression through Phase I trials for conditions such as gout and heart failure, combined with promising data in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy, strongly supports its potential utility in renal settings (Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Preclinical studies show reduced renal IL-1β secretion, diminished macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis when NLRP3 is inhibited by agents like OLT1177, lending biological credence to the hypothesis that inflammasome inhibition could slow CKD progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nAt the molecular level, the precise action of OLT1177—binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ASC recruitment—represents a highly targeted approach that contrasts with cytokine-neutralizing therapies such as anti-IL-1β antibodies. This specificity is advantageous because it not only prevents the generation of IL-1β but also curtails the activation of NFκB and other downstream inflammatory cascades, potentially reducing off-target effects and preserving broader immune competence (Marchetti et al., 2018; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020). Additionally, the expected anti-inflammatory effects in renal tubular cells—specifically preventing pyroptosis and fibrogenesis—are consistent with literature demonstrating that NLRP3 is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells under hyperglycemic and inflammatory stress (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain. One of the limitations stems from the current lack of direct clinical evidence in CKD populations; while animal models provide a strong rationale, the translation of these findings into human CKD may be complicated by the multifactorial nature of the disease, where multiple pathways contribute to renal injury beyond inflammasome activation. Additionally, the chronic nature of CKD necessitates prolonged administration of therapeutic agents, and long-term safety data for OLT1177 in such a setting are still pending. There is also the possibility that inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome might impair necessary innate immune responses, although the specificity of OLT1177 for the NLRP3 complex—in contrast to more generalized anti-inflammatory agents—should, in theory, mitigate this concern (Seok et al., 2021).\n\nMoreover, while the preclinical data in models of diabetic nephropathy and crystal-induced kidney injury are promising, variability in genetic and environmental factors in human CKD could affect the compound’s efficacy. It will therefore be critical to design dedicated clinical trials in defined CKD populations, ideally incorporating biomarkers of inflammasome activity, such as circulating IL-1β and IL-18 levels, as well as imaging and functional assessments of renal fibrosis and function. The anti-fibrotic effects, in particular, warrant closer mechanistic studies to confirm that inhibition of TEC pyroptosis and preservation of tubular integrity occur in the human kidney as they do in animal models (Williams et al., 2022; Cliff, 2023).\n\nIn conclusion, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) represents a compelling candidate for repurposing in Chronic Kidney Disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, favorable pharmacological profile, and preclinical evidence supporting its renoprotective effects. Its ability to directly inhibit the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding to the NACHT domain and blocking ASC recruitment addresses a critical upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that leads to caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and subsequent pyroptosis of renal tubular cells. This mode of action has the potential to attenuate the inflammation-driven fibrogenesis that is central to CKD progression, particularly in diabetic nephropathy where hyperglycemic stress is a key driver of renal injury.\n\nStrengths of OLT1177 include its synthetic origin allowing for structural optimization, its demonstrated safety in Phase I clinical trials, its oral bioavailability which is advantageous for chronic therapy, and its selective inhibitory action that minimizes off-target effects. Additionally, existing preclinical studies showing reduced renal IL-1β, diminished macrophage infiltration, and lowered fibrotic responses in models of nephropathy provide a promising foundation for further exploration in CKD (Mulay, 2019; Jansen et al., 2019).\n\nWeaknesses or challenges include the current absence of dedicated clinical trials in CKD, the complexity of CKD pathophysiology where multiple inflammatory and fibrotic pathways are involved, and the potential risk that chronic inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome could in some contexts compromise the host defense or alter essential cellular processes. These concerns underscore the need for carefully designed preclinical studies specifically in renal disease models, followed by early phase clinical trials in well-defined CKD populations to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and long-term safety.\n\nOverall, based on the comprehensive literature review, the mechanistic rationale, and the encouraging preclinical and early clinical data available, OLT1177 shows significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease. The next steps should involve further detailed studies in CKD-specific preclinical models that assess not only inflammatory cytokine modulation but also functional outcomes such as glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria reduction, and fibrosis attenuation. A robust clinical development program targeting patients with diabetic nephropathy and other forms of CKD characterized by inflammasome activation would be the logical progression to validate its clinical utility (Marchetti et al., 2018; Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nReferences  \nCliff, C.

"(VX-765, 5)","(Tranilast, 3)","Both candidates target inflammasome‐mediated inflammation and fibrosis in CKD, but they differ in evidence depth, mechanistic clarity, safety pedigree, and translatability. Tranilast (ID 3) is a repurposed anti‐allergic with decades of human use and emerging preclinical efficacy in diabetic nephropathy and UUO. It inhibits NLRP3 assembly (disrupting NLRP3–ASC/NEK7 interactions) and attenuates TGF-β/PDGF signaling, offering dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. Limited biomarker reductions (collagen IV, albuminuria) in small clinical observations bolster its CKD relevance, and oral availability simplifies repurposing. However, the precise molecular interaction with NLRP3 (LRR domain binding) requires further structural validation, and no dedicated CKD trials exist.

VX-765 (Belnacasan; ID 5) is a caspase-1 inhibitor prodrug with robust structural and biochemical validation—its active metabolite irreversibly covalently modifies Cys285 in caspase-1’s active site with high selectivity, as confirmed by crystallography. Preclinical rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and UUO show reduced IL-1β/IL-18, gasdermin D cleavage, macrophage infiltration, TGF-β expression, and collagen deposition. Crucially, VX-765 has advanced through Phase II trials in epilepsy and psoriasis with an established human safety and oral PK profile, demonstrating target engagement and tolerability. No CKD trials exist, but the class precedent and mechanistic specificity support rapid repurposing.

Mechanism: VX-765’s direct, well-characterized blockade of caspase-1 gives high confidence in interrupting pyroptosis and cytokine maturation. Tranilast’s dual MoA is attractive but mechanistically less validated at the molecular level. Safety: Tranilast has long‐term human use; VX-765 shows good Phase II safety but unknown chronic CKD effects. Feasibility: Both are orally dosed; VX-765’s PK/PD is well documented in humans. Evidence relevance: Tranilast has small‐scale CKD biomarker data; VX-765 lacks human CKD data but benefits from solid preclinical and human data in other inflammatory disorders.

Overall, VX-765’s combination of mechanistic precision, structural validation, human safety/PK, and strong preclinical renal efficacy outweighs Tranilast’s broader but less rigorously validated MoA and limited CKD clinical experience.","VX-765 is superior because it provides a highly specific, structurally validated mechanism of action directly targeting caspase-1, the downstream effector of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. This confers strong confidence in on-target efficacy, as evidenced by crystallography, biochemical assays, and in vivo renal models, combined with established human safety and PK from Phase II studies. Although Tranilast offers dual anti-inflammatory/fibrotic effects and long-term safety as an anti-allergic, its precise NLRP3 interaction needs further confirmation, and it lacks structured clinical evaluation in CKD. VX-765’s clear translatability, target engagement, and definable dose‐response make it the preferable candidate for rapid advancement into CKD trials.",6,"(3, 5)","{'hypothesis': 'Tranilast (MedChemExpress, catalog #HY-50819)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Tranilast (MedChemExpress, catalog #HY-50819)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nTranilast, commercially available from MedChemExpress (catalog #HY-50819), is a small-molecule synthetic compound originally developed as an anti-allergic agent. Chemically, it is an anthranilic acid derivative, specifically N-[3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl]-anthranilic acid, synthesized initially to treat allergic conditions such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and cutaneous disorders, including keloids and hypertrophic scars (Gilbert et al., 2012). The compound belongs to a class of agents that modulate inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways. The early synthesis of tranilast involved modifying the cinnamoyl anthranilate moiety to enhance potency against pro-fibrotic mediators like transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) while maintaining an acceptable toxicity profile. Over time, the compound’s anti-allergic properties were expanded by preclinical findings that demonstrated its potential to inhibit fibrotic changes via modulation of cytokine signaling and cellular proliferation pathways. This class of anthranilic acid derivatives has been used both in dermatologic and immunologic contexts, providing a background of clinical utility and safety that benefits the repurposing efforts for conditions such as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nTranilast has a well-documented history in clinical settings as an anti-allergic drug since its introduction in Japan decades ago. Its traditional indications have included treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and prevention of keloid formation. More recently, emerging preclinical studies have evaluated tranilast for its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in multiple organ systems. Notably, in experimental animal models of renal disease, tranilast has been investigated in contexts such as diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In these models, tranilast demonstrated the ability to reduce proteinuria, improve kidney structural integrity, and diminish collagen deposition (Gilbert et al., 2012). For instance, in diabetic nephropathy studies, tranilast reduced albuminuria and slowed the decline in glomerular filtration rate through attenuation of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix accumulation. Additionally, human studies in early-stage CKD patients, particularly those with diabetic nephropathy, receiving tranilast combined with standard therapies such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs have shown reductions in urinary markers like collagen type IV and albumin excretion (Gilbert et al., 2012). Beyond renal applications, the compound’s repurposing has been explored in cardiovascular contexts and even in certain inflammatory conditions driven by aberrant inflammasome activation, suggesting a versatility that supports further investigation into its utility against CKD. However, review of ClinicalTrials.gov did not reveal any registered trials directly assessing tranilast in CKD or related renal fibrosis, indicating that while preclinical and limited clinical observations are encouraging, robust clinical evaluation in CKD remains to be undertaken (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe hypothesized mechanism for tranilast in CKD centers on its ability to inhibit key inflammatory and fibrotic processes via direct intervention in inflammasome biology. Tranilast’s molecular target is the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex that plays a pivotal role in innate inflammatory responses. The assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires a coordinated interaction among NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and the serine/threonine kinase NEK7. Activation of this complex ultimately leads to the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form, which subsequently processes pro-IL-1β into IL-1β, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that drives pyroptosis and contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Specifically, tranilast is proposed to disrupt the critical interactions between NLRP3 and ASC as well as between NLRP3 and NEK7. This disruption is believed to occur via direct binding to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3, which is essential for its oligomerization and subsequent recruitment of ASC. By preventing ASC oligomerization, tranilast effectively halts the assembly of the inflammasome, thereby blocking caspase-1 activation and reducing IL-1β secretion (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).\n\nIn addition to inflammasome disruption, tranilast has been shown to attenuate TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling—another major contributor to kidney disease progression. TGF-β is well documented as a central mediator of extracellular matrix synthesis and fibroblast activation, and its overexpression in chronic kidney injury drives interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. Tranilast’s inhibition of TGF-β signaling includes the suppression of Smad2 phosphorylation and downstream fibrotic responses, leading to reductions in collagen deposition and interstitial matrix accumulation (Gilbert et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2019). Furthermore, tranilast’s capacity to inhibit PDGF signaling reduces mesangial cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in the renal glomerulus, providing an additional mechanistic avenue through which it exerts its renoprotective effects (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the proposed mechanism, the expected effect of tranilast in a CKD context is to attenuate tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis by mitigating both inflammatory and fibrotic signaling. In tubular epithelial cells (TECs), oxidative stress triggers activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in IL-1β secretion and pyroptotic cell death—a process that not only damages the epithelial barrier but also leads to further recruitment of inflammatory cells. By interfering with the NLRP3–ASC and NLRP3–NEK7 interactions, tranilast is anticipated to reduce caspase-1 activation. Consequently, a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis is expected, which would alleviate tubular inflammation under conditions of oxidative stress (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).\n\nFurthermore, the reduction in IL-1β and subsequent dampening of the inflammatory cascade should also lead to a decrease in TGF-β release. TGF-β is critically involved in driving fibroblast activation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. Thus, by curtailing the initial inflammasome-mediated inflammatory trigger, tranilast indirectly reduces TGF-β levels, thereby preventing its downstream pro-fibrotic effects. This is particularly relevant in diabetic nephropathy and UUO models, where TGF-β-mediated fibrosis is a major determinant of disease progression (Chen et al., 2020; Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nIn summary, the expected outcome in an in vitro or in vivo CKD assay would be a demonstrable decrease in markers of inflammation (such as IL-1β levels), reduced caspase-1 activity, diminished pyroptosis (as measured by LDH release or similar assays), and lowered expression of fibrotic markers including collagen, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Moreover, the preservation of tubular epithelial cell integrity and a consequent improvement in overall kidney function would provide functional support for tranilast’s therapeutic efficacy in CKD (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nTranilast represents a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease based on its dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. From a mechanistic standpoint, its ability to selectively disrupt the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting key protein–protein interactions (specifically between NLRP3, ASC, and NEK7) underpins its potential to reduce caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. This targeted mechanism is particularly attractive because it distinguishes tranilast from broader-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs that may have off-target effects. Moreover, by concurrently attenuating TGF-β signaling pathways, tranilast can reduce fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition—both critical contributors to the progression of CKD (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019).\n\nA major strength of tranilast is its established clinical use as an anti-allergic agent over several decades, which provides a substantial record of safety and tolerability in humans. Its oral dosing regimen further facilitates rapid clinical repurposing for CKD. Preclinical studies in animal models of diabetic nephropathy and UUO have demonstrated measurable benefits, such as reduced proteinuria and improved renal histology, lending support to its potential efficacy in human CKD (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nHowever, there are certain weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Despite promising preclinical data, there is a noted absence of registered clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with tranilast (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), which indicates that further clinical validation is required. Moreover, while tranilast’s inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is supported by various mechanistic studies, the precise molecular details—such as confirmation of binding to the LRR domain of NLRP3 and the exact nature of its impact on NEK7 interactions—require further elucidation through biochemical and structural studies (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). In addition, as with any repurposed drug, careful evaluation of potential off-target immunomodulatory effects is necessary. There have been reports of immune-mediated adverse events in other clinical indications, which, although not prominent, must be monitored during chronic administration in CKD patients (Strilchuk et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, the body of preclinical literature strongly supports the hypothesis that tranilast can disrupt NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and attenuate subsequent inflammatory and fibrotic cascades in the kidney. Given its dual mechanism—inhibiting both inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion and TGF-β–mediated fibrosis—tranilast emerges as an attractive candidate for repurposing in CKD. Its established use in other indications and favorable oral bioavailability further underscore its potential for rapid clinical translation. Nonetheless, the lack of direct clinical trial evidence in renal disease and the need for further mechanistic clarification represent critical challenges that the research team must address in subsequent studies (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023). Overall, the strengths of mechanistic specificity and a well-established safety profile position tranilast as a promising drug candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease, warranting further investigation through comprehensive preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials.\n\nReferences  \nChen, S., Wang, Y., Pan, Y., Liu, Y., Zheng, S., Ding, K., Mu, K., Yuan, Y., Li, Z., Song, H., Jin, Y., & Fu, J.

It belongs to the class of caspase-1 inhibitors, which are designed to target the proteolytic enzyme caspase‐1 responsible for the post-translational processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Originally discovered through efforts to identify small molecules that could modulate inflammasome-mediated inflammation, VX-765 was synthesized to covalently interact with the catalytic cysteine residue of caspase‐1 and thereby block its activity. This group of compounds is part of a broader category of anti-inflammatory agents that have been applied in conditions where excessive inflammasome activation leads to tissue damage, and they have been used in clinical studies for disorders such as epilepsy and psoriasis, demonstrating that this drug class can effectively modulate immune signaling pathways and cytokine maturation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nVX-765 has an established history in preclinical and early clinical research. It has advanced into Phase II trials in both epilepsy and psoriasis, conditions associated with chronic inflammation and abnormal cytokine signaling, thereby establishing a safety profile and demonstrating adequate target engagement in humans. Although it has not been widely evaluated in clinical trials specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), preclinical studies conducted in rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) have demonstrated that VX-765 effectively reduces markers of inflammation such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), diminishes macrophage infiltration, and reduces collagen deposition, which are indicative of reduced fibrotic remodeling in the kidney (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024). Additionally, the general class of caspase-1 inhibitors has been successfully applied in various inflammatory conditions, and mechanistic studies suggest that inhibiting caspase-1 can interrupt the cascade leading to pyroptotic cell death—a key factor in inflammatory tissue damage. Although there is no large-scale clinical trial data in CKD to date, the compound’s mechanism, coupled with existing human safety data from other indications, strongly supports its rapid repurposing potential for kidney diseases (Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nVX-765’s mechanism of action is centered on the selective inhibition of caspase-1, an essential enzyme involved in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, and in mediating a form of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that VX-765 is a prodrug that is metabolized into VRT-043198, which binds irreversibly to the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys285) in the active site of caspase-1 through covalent interactions. Structural analyses, including crystallography experiments, have elucidated that VRT-043198 makes additional hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with key residues (e.g., R179, Q283, P343, and R383) ensuring a high degree of selectivity for inflammatory caspases over apoptotic caspases (Yang, 2019). By blocking caspase-1, VX-765 prevents the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active cytokine forms, thereby reducing the release of these potent inflammatory mediators; it also prevents the cleavage of gasdermin D, a critical effector protein required to form membrane pores that mediate pyroptotic cell death. In renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and other cell types implicated in kidney disease, such proclivity for pyroptosis can drive local inflammatory cascades and fibrotic signaling, so inhibiting caspase-1 may mitigate these processes (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). The specificity of VX-765 for caspase-1 has been confirmed through both in vitro assays—with assessments of IL-1β release and gasdermin D cleavage—and in vivo models where administration of VX-765 led to reduced serum IL-1β, improved survival in sepsis models, and attenuation of inflammatory tissue injury (Yang, 2019; Liu et al., 2023).\n\nExpected Effect in Chronic Kidney Disease:  \nIn the context of Chronic Kidney Disease, particularly conditions characterized by diabetic nephropathy and renal fibrosis, the hypothesis is that VX-765 will reduce caspase-1 mediated pyroptosis and subsequent inflammatory cytokine release in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). TEC pyroptosis contributes to tubular cell death and triggers a deleterious inflammatory milieu that ultimately drives fibrotic remodeling through the activation of myofibroblasts and increased deposition of extracellular matrix components such as collagen. VX-765 is expected to block this cascade at an early step by preventing the activation of caspase-1, thereby limiting IL-1β and IL-18 maturation and secretion. This, in turn, should reduce the recruitment and activation of inflammatory macrophages—a process that has been shown to contribute to fibrogenesis in the kidney (Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Preclinical evidence from rodent models supports that administration of VX-765 leads to decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced expression of pro-fibrotic markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and a lower deposition of collagen, thereby preserving renal tubular structure and function. Considering caspase-1 and the inflammasome complex are expressed in renal cells including TECs and resident macrophages, targeting caspase-1 is a rational approach to interrupt the feedback loop between cell death and inflammation that exacerbates CKD progression (Zhou & Li, 2023; Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of VX-765 as a therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease include its well-defined mechanism of action, oral bioavailability, and the fact that it has already undergone Phase II clinical trials in other indications, demonstrating an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in humans. The mechanistic rationale is strong: by targeting caspase-1, VX-765 interrupts the inflammasome-driven cascade responsible for both pyroptotic cell death and the maturation of key pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in renal fibrosis. Preclinical models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction have provided promising evidence that caspase-1 inhibition can reduce renal inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and extracellular matrix deposition, suggesting that VX-765 might slow the progression of fibrotic changes in CKD (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). Furthermore, targeting a central mediator such as caspase-1 may have broader benefits by influencing several downstream inflammatory pathways simultaneously, thus potentially overcoming the limitations of therapies that target individual cytokines.  \nWeaknesses include the translational gap that currently exists between preclinical efficacy in rodent models and clinical benefit in human CKD patients. Although VX-765 has demonstrated safety in epilepsy and psoriasis trials, the long-term effects of inhibiting caspase-1 in a chronic disease setting like CKD are not fully understood, particularly given the complex roles that inflammasome signaling may play in tissue repair, host defense, and kidney homeostasis. There is also the possibility that fully inhibiting caspase-1 could lead to compensatory activation of alternative inflammatory pathways or unintended off-target effects, especially in patients with compromised kidney function. Additionally, while preclinical data are encouraging, there is a need for dedicated clinical trials in CKD and related fibrotic conditions to establish the optimal dosing, efficacy, and safety profile in this specific patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).  \nOverall, VX-765 exhibits several promising attributes as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for CKD: its defined molecular target, demonstrated anti-inflammatory mechanism through caspase-1 inhibition, and supportive preclinical evidence of renoprotection provide a compelling rationale for further investigation. The strengths of existing human safety data and oral administration combine with a robust mechanistic framework to justify advancing VX-765 into clinical trials in patients with CKD. Nonetheless, further research is required to clarify long-term effects on renal function, potential compensatory inflammatory mechanisms, and the detailed pharmacodynamics in the setting of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. With carefully designed clinical studies focusing on renal endpoints, VX-765 could represent a valuable addition to the therapeutic arsenal against CKD, particularly for patients whose disease is driven significantly by inflammasome-mediated inflammation and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

"(MCC950, 9)","(Oridonin, 6)","Both candidates target the NLRP3 inflammasome, a validated driver of CKD inflammation and fibrosis. Candidate 1, Oridonin, is a natural diterpenoid with a covalent MoA at Cys279 of NLRP3 and demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects in cancer, colitis, gout, and acute kidney injury models. However, direct evidence in podocytes or chronic CKD models is limited, potency and bioavailability are moderate, and solubility/formulation challenges remain. Candidate 2, MCC950, is a rationally designed diarylsulfonylurea inhibitor that binds the Walker B motif of NLRP3, blocking ATP hydrolysis. It has extensive, robust preclinical data in multiple rodent CKD models (diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, adenine-induced renal failure) showing reduced proteinuria, fibrosis, and improved renal function. MCC950 also has favorable oral bioavailability, non-human primate safety, and well‐characterized PK/PD. Although clinical data in CKD is still emerging, the depth and relevance of MCC950’s preclinical evidence in chronic renal contexts and its clear MoA and translational profile outweigh Oridonin’s more peripheral and less optimized data.","MCC950 exhibits stronger and more directly relevant preclinical efficacy in chronic kidney disease models, a clearer and validated mechanism of action in renal cell types, and a well-characterized safety and pharmacokinetic profile. Oridonin, while mechanistically interesting, lacks dedicated CKD studies in target renal cells, faces formulation and bioavailability hurdles, and has only preliminary renoprotective data. Therefore, MCC950 offers the highest probability of successful experimental outcome and translation into a viable CKD therapy.",7,"(6, 9)","{'hypothesis': 'Oridonin (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #O2015)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Oridonin (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #O2015)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nOridonin is a naturally occurring diterpenoid compound isolated primarily from Rabdosia rubescens, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb that has been used for centuries to treat inflammatory conditions and cancers. As a kaurane-type diterpenoid, its structure comprises four isoprene units arranged into a characteristic tetracyclic skeleton, which is emblematic of this class of natural products. The compound’s discovery and development emerged from the long-standing tradition of using Rabdosia rubescens (also known as Donglingcao) in Asian folk medicine, where it was historically applied for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In the broader context of drug development, diterpenoids such as oridonin have been recognized for their “drug-like” properties; they have provided scaffolds for synthetic modifications aimed at improving potency, solubility, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Moreover, the extraction and study of oridonin reflect an important paradigm in natural products research, wherein historical use is validated and expanded upon with modern medicinal chemistry techniques. This compound, commercially available from suppliers like Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #O2015), fits well within the class of small-molecule natural products that have been repurposed for modern therapeutic applications in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases (Ding et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOridonin’s use spans a broad spectrum of therapeutic applications. Traditionally, the herbal preparations containing oridonin were employed in Chinese medicine to alleviate conditions ranging from pharyngitis and gingivitis to various inflammatory and tumorous conditions. With the advent of modern biochemical and pharmacological research, oridonin has been extensively studied for its anticancer efficacy; many preclinical studies have demonstrated its capacity to induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and suppress metastasis in a variety of cancer cell lines (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In addition to its anticancer properties, several studies have documented oridonin’s robust anti-inflammatory actions. Notably, oridonin has shown efficacy in experimental models of colitis and gout through its inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that mediates the maturation of IL-1β and is a critical driver of inflammatory responses (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020). Although most of the historical and ongoing research has emphasized oridonin’s anticancer and acute inflammatory indications, there is emerging interest in its potential role in renal pathologies. A search on ClinicalTrials.gov using terms such as “Oridonin AND kidney OR renal OR chronic kidney disease OR glomerulonephritis OR proteinuria OR glomerular” returned tens of thousands of trials, indicating significant research activity into natural products and potentially repurposed compounds for kidney diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, to date there is limited direct clinical evidence of oridonin being deployed specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preclinical studies, particularly those involving rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and ischemia–reperfusion injury, have demonstrated renoprotective effects such as reduced inflammatory cytokine levels, diminished fibrosis markers, and improved renal function parameters; these effects suggest that oridonin or its derivatives might be promising candidates for treating CKD or similar renal conditions (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, oridonin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects primarily through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex known to activate caspase-1 and mediate the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. Recent mechanistic studies have shown that oridonin covalently binds to cysteine 279 within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, a critical residue required for the ATPase activity of NLRP3 and its subsequent oligomerization (He et al., 2018). This binding effectively prevents the conformational changes necessary for the recruitment of NEK7, thereby halting inflammasome assembly and activation. In macrophages, this inhibition leads to a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and attenuates inflammatory cell recruitment—a mechanism that has been validated through pull‐down assays and mass spectrometry, which demonstrated nanomolar potency of oridonin in suppressing NLRP3 activation (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020).\n\nBeyond its direct interaction with the NLRP3 inflammasome, oridonin has been shown to modulate additional signaling pathways. For example, it can inhibit NF-κB and p38-MAPK activation, further blunting the inflammatory response, and it has been implicated in the activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidative defenses at lower concentrations, contributing to its cytoprotective effects (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019). These multifaceted actions underscore the polypharmacological nature of oridonin: while its primary mode of action appears to involve covalent modification of NLRP3, its downstream effects extend into a broader anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative network. This convergence on inflammatory signaling pathways is particularly relevant because overactivation of the inflammasome and subsequent pyroptotic cell death are implicated not only in acute inflammatory diseases but also in chronic fibrotic processes within the kidney (Ding et al., 2020).\n\nExpanding the context to renal pathology, the hypothesis driving our proposal is that human podocytes—which are essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier—express components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of NLRP3 in these cells has been linked to pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, which in turn contributes to podocyte loss, proteinuria, and interstitial fibrosis, all hallmarks of CKD. Although most direct evidence of oridonin’s NLRP3 inhibition comes from studies in immune cells like macrophages (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2016), the underlying mechanism is conserved across cell types. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that oridonin could similarly inhibit NLRP3 activation in podocytes, thereby preventing inflammasome assembly, blocking caspase-1 activation, and ultimately reducing the release of IL-1β (Li et al., 2021). By precluding these downstream events, oridonin may attenuate the cycle of inflammatory damage and fibrosis that underpins progressive renal injury in CKD (Li et al., 2021).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the proposed assays and eventual in vivo models of chronic kidney disease, the expected effect of oridonin centers on its ability to protect podocytes from NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated injury. More specifically, by covalently binding to cysteine 279 in NLRP3, oridonin is anticipated to inhibit ATP hydrolysis and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex. This mechanistic blockade should result in a reduction of caspase-1 activation—a key step in the maturation of IL-1β—and thereby diminish the secretion of this potent pro-inflammatory cytokine (He et al., 2018). In podocytes, such suppression is expected to reduce pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death that directly compromises the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and leads to proteinuria. Preservation of podocyte viability would, in turn, help maintain glomerular barrier integrity, minimizing the leakage of plasma proteins into the urine and limiting the ensuing fibrotic response in the renal interstitium (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nMoreover, the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB and p38-MAPK signaling pathways could provide additional benefits by reducing overall renal inflammation. In animal models of kidney injury—such as those induced by ischemia–reperfusion or diabetic nephropathy—treatment with compounds that inhibit these pathways has been correlated with improved renal function parameters (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021). Therefore, beyond its direct effect on podocyte inflammasome activity, oridonin may exert broader renoprotective actions by dampening inflammatory cascades that contribute to interstitial fibrosis and progressive renal insufficiency. In this context, oridonin’s oral bioavailability and established history in traditional medicine support the feasibility of translating these preclinical findings into clinical benefit for CKD patients (Su et al., 2024).\n\nIt is important to note that while direct evidence of oridonin’s effects on human podocytes remains to be fully elucidated, the expression of NLRP3 in podocytes has been demonstrated in experimental models of CKD. Additionally, studies involving natural products that inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome—such as fucoidan in diabetic kidney disease—have provided supportive mechanistic insights, suggesting that the targeting of inflammasome activation in podocytes is a viable therapeutic strategy (Wang et al., 2022).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nOverall, oridonin emerges as a compelling therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease, given its well-documented mechanism of inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome and its extensive background in modulating inflammatory pathways. Its natural origin and historical use in traditional Chinese medicine provide a robust basis for its safety profile, and preclinical studies have demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, including models of colitis, gout, and even acute kidney injury (Ding et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2021). Strengths of oridonin include its specificity for NLRP3 via covalent binding to a critical cysteine residue, which has been shown to yield nanomolar potency in relevant assays (He et al., 2018). Additionally, oridonin’s ability to modulate secondary pathways (NF-κB, p38-MAPK, and Nrf2) may amplify its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective benefits, addressing multiple facets of CKD pathophysiology ranging from podocyte loss to interstitial fibrosis (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nHowever, several weaknesses must also be considered. Despite promising preclinical data in other disease models, direct evidence for oridonin’s efficacy in modulating NLRP3 activation specifically in podocytes remains limited. Most mechanistic studies have been conducted in macrophages or other cell types, and while the extrapolation is reasonable given the conserved nature of inflammasome signaling, dedicated studies using human podocytes are needed to substantiate the proposed protective effects on proteinuria and interstitial fibrosis (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Furthermore, issues such as moderate potency, limited solubility, and variable bioavailability have been noted with oridonin, necessitating further formulation and structural optimization to ensure therapeutic efficacy in a clinical setting (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). These pharmacokinetic considerations are particularly critical for a chronic indication like CKD, where long-term dosing and sustained target engagement are required.\n\nAnother consideration is the translation of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects observed in acute injury models or non-renal tissue into the context of chronic kidney disease, which involves complex and multifactorial pathophysiology. Although the suppression of inflammasome-driven pyroptosis is a promising target for preventing podocyte injury, CKD progression involves additional factors such as hemodynamic stress, metabolic derangements, and immune dysregulation that may not be fully addressed by NLRP3 inhibition alone (Huang et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2020). Consequently, while the mechanistic specificity of oridonin is appealing, its efficacy in a multifaceted chronic disease state like CKD requires rigorous preclinical validation followed by carefully designed clinical trials.\n\nIn summary, oridonin holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease based on its robust anti-inflammatory mechanism, particularly its ability to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome via covalent binding to cysteine 279. The compound’s multifaceted mechanism—encompassing inhibition of caspase-1 activation, IL-1β maturation, and subsequent pyroptosis—could translate into preservation of podocyte integrity, reduction in proteinuria, and attenuation of interstitial fibrosis, all of which are critical endpoints in CKD management (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Nonetheless, challenges related to drug solubility, bioavailability, and the direct demonstration of efficacy in podocytes must be addressed. Given its strong preclinical validation in other inflammatory conditions, further targeted studies focusing on its renal effects and optimization of drug-like properties are warranted before it can be advanced as a viable treatment for CKD (Tan et al., 2021; Su et al., 2024). Overall, while there is a clear mechanistic rationale supporting the therapeutic potential of oridonin in CKD, additional studies specifically assessing its effects in relevant renal cell types and chronic disease models will be critical to fully validate its clinical utility.\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

It belongs to the diarylsulfonylurea class of compounds, which emerged from medicinal chemistry efforts that initially focused on sulfonylurea drugs such as glyburide. Glyburide was found to have anti‐inflammatory properties mediated by inhibition of the NLRP3 complex; however, its clinical utility as an anti-inflammatory agent was limited by its potent effects on insulin release and the consequent risk of hypoglycemia. To overcome these limitations, researchers refined the chemical structure and synthesized MCC950, a derivative that retains the inflammasome inhibitory activity of glyburide without disturbing insulin secretion. The design of MCC950 was based on structure–activity relationship studies that identified the importance of the diarylsulfonylurea moiety, and its eventual discovery positioned it as a gold-standard benchmark compound for NLRP3 inhibition (Kaur et al., 2025; Coll et al., 2019). This compound has been synthesized and purified by several vendors including Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #SML 2233), ensuring reproducibility and accessibility to research teams. Overall, MCC950 represents a promising example of rational drug design aimed at selectively targeting components of the innate immune system and addressing the inflammatory cascades that contribute to disease pathology.\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of MCC950 is marked by extensive preclinical evidence spanning animal models of a wide array of inflammatory disorders. Initially investigated in models of auto-inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, MCC950 quickly emerged as the benchmark inhibitor for studying NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated inflammation. In rodent models of kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, and adenine-induced chronic renal failure, MCC950 has demonstrated significant reductions in proteinuria, attenuated fibrosis, and improvements in overall renal function (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). Preclinical studies conducted in diabetic models have shown that chronic treatment with MCC950 leads to marked improvements in histopathological kidney damage, as evidenced by reduced mesangial expansion and decreased podocyte injury (Zhang et al., 2019). In addition, rodent studies in salt-sensitive hypertensive models reveal that inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome via MCC950 results in lower blood pressure, decreased interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, and reduced collagen deposition in renal tissues (Krishnan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2025). Although robust evidence from animal studies supports its efficacy in models of chronic kidney disease (CKD), clinical translation remains limited with only sparse early-phase clinical trials referenced in the literature (ClinicalTrials.gov). Additionally, the favorable safety profile observed in non-human primate studies further underpins its potential for repurposing in CKD, although more clinical data are needed to fully establish its benefit–risk profile.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nMCC950’s mechanism of action is both specific and well-characterized at the molecular level. The compound exerts its inhibitory effect by directly binding to the Walker B motif located within the NACHT domain of the NLRP3 protein. This binding interferes with the ATP hydrolysis that is essential for NLRP3 activation and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Under normal pathological conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC and the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form. Active caspase-1 then processes pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature forms and also initiates gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death. By preventing ATP hydrolysis, MCC950 locks NLRP3 in an inactive conformation, thereby obstructing the assembly of the entire inflammasome complex, reducing caspase-1 activation and cytokine maturation (Kim et al., 2019; Zhan et al., 2023). In the context of human tubular epithelial cells (TECs), which express NLRP3 and contribute to renal inflammatory cascades, MCC950’s engagement with the Walker B motif is proposed to significantly curb inflammasome formation. Such direct target engagement has been validated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and mutagenesis assays that confirm the drug’s specificity and potency. Blocking inflammasome assembly not only reduces cytokine release but also limits the formation of gasdermin D pores that are responsible for pyroptotic cell death, thereby preventing tubular cell loss and reducing interstitial inflammation (Liu et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven its robust preclinical evidence, the expected effect of MCC950 in assays focusing on CKD and related kidney injury is multifaceted. In in vitro models using human TECs, the hypothesis is that treatment with MCC950 will prevent ATP hydrolysis, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. As a result, the maturation and release of IL-1β and IL-18 will be significantly reduced, ultimately leading to lower levels of pyroptosis, attenuation of inflammation, and prevention of the fibrotic remodeling that often accompanies progressive CKD (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). In vivo, these effects are anticipated to manifest as decreased proteinuria, improved kidney function markers, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, and lower extracellular matrix deposition. This translates into a reduction in renal interstitial fibrosis and a preservation of normal tubular architecture, thereby ameliorating the progressive decline in renal function seen in CKD models. The expression profile of NLRP3 in TECs, coupled with its established role in mediating inflammatory and fibrotic responses, provides a solid rationale for targeting NLRP3 in chronic kidney disease (Zhang et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). The proposed mechanism is in alignment with the pathological features of CKD, where sustained low-grade inflammation and fibrosis lead to irreversible kidney damage.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nMCC950 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease due to several compelling strengths. First, its rational design as a selective NLRP3 inhibitor ensures that it directly targets a critical inflammatory pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of CKD. The extensive preclinical evidence in diverse animal models—from diabetic nephropathy to salt-sensitive hypertension and adenine-induced renal failure—strongly supports its renoprotective effects, including reductions in proteinuria, improved renal function, and diminished fibrotic remodeling (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Sabra et al., 2023). Second, the detailed elucidation of its molecular mechanism—confirming binding to the Walker B motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ATP hydrolysis—provides a clear mechanistic rationale that is essential for translational development (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Third, its favorable pharmacological properties, including oral bioavailability and a safety profile established in non-human primates, further underline its developmental feasibility (Kaur et al., 2025; ClinicalTrials.gov).  \n\nHowever, there are some potential weaknesses that must be carefully considered. Although rodent models have provided robust efficacy data, the translation of these effects to humans remains to be fully validated. There is a paucity of comprehensive clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with MCC950, which introduces uncertainty regarding its efficacy and potential off-target effects in a human patient population. Additionally, while the compound is highly selective for the NLRP3 inflammasome, it is critical to further elucidate its long-term safety and impact on global immune function, given the essential role of inflammasomes in host defense. In some experimental contexts, there has been variability in the inhibition of inflammation and fibrosis depending on the specific disease model, suggesting that its therapeutic window may differ based on disease etiology (Sabra et al., 2023). Despite these challenges, the overall evidence supports the further development of MCC950 as a mechanistic intervention in CKD, particularly in settings where inflammasome-driven pathology is predominant.\n\nIn summary, MCC950 is a well-characterized, rationally designed NLRP3 inhibitor with strong preclinical evidence demonstrating its renoprotective effects in various models of chronic kidney disease. Its specific binding to the Walker B motif of the NLRP3 NACHT domain and subsequent inhibition of ATP hydrolysis form the basis of its mechanism, reducing caspase-1 activation, IL-1β/IL-18 maturation, and gasdermin-D-mediated pyroptosis. These actions are expected to translate into reduced tubular epithelial cell death, diminished interstitial inflammation, and alleviation of fibrotic remodeling—key pathological processes in CKD progression. While further clinical validation is necessary, the strengths in mechanistic rationale, preclinical efficacy data, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties position MCC950 as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Coll et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022).\n\nReferences  \nColl, R.

"(VX-765, 5)","(CY-09, 7)","Both VX-765 (ID:5) and CY-09 (ID:7) target inflammasome-mediated pathways involved in CKD progression, yet they differ substantially in maturity of evidence and translational readiness. VX-765 is a caspase-1 inhibitor whose active metabolite VRT-043198 irreversibly blocks caspase-1–mediated IL-1β/IL-18 maturation and gasdermin D cleavage. It has undergone Phase II trials in epilepsy and psoriasis, demonstrating human safety and oral bioavailability, and shows direct efficacy in rodent CKD models (diabetic nephropathy, UUO) with reduced renal inflammation, macrophage infiltration, TGF-β expression, collagen deposition, and preserved tubular function. Conversely, CY-09 is a potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor that binds the NACHT Walker A motif, preventing oligomerization and upstream caspase-1 activation. Preclinical work in macrophage assays and nonrenal disease models (sepsis, colitis, metabolic disorders) shows nanomolar potency and rodent tolerability, but direct CKD efficacy data are lacking, relying on extrapolation from genetic NLRP3 knockout and surrogate inhibitors like MCC950. VX-765’s mechanism is well-characterized biochemically and structurally, with dedicated CKD studies establishing target engagement and functional outcomes. CY-09 offers specificity for NLRP3 and an upstream intervention point, but faces translational gaps: no human safety data, limited kidney-specific preclinical results, potential off-target ATPase interactions, and unknown long-term effects in chronic disease. VX-765’s existing clinical safety, robust CKD animal data, and clear path to repurposing make it a stronger candidate for rapid translation in CKD.","Although both compounds target inflammasome-driven pyroptosis and cytokine release, VX-765 outperforms CY-09 in four key areas: (1) Strength of Evidence: VX-765 has direct rodent CKD efficacy studies, whereas CY-09’s renal data are inferential. (2) Clinical Readiness: VX-765 has Phase II human safety and PK data; CY-09 lacks clinical safety studies. (3) Mechanistic Clarity: VX-765’s irreversible caspase-1 inhibition is well validated in kidney models; CY-09’s NLRP3 blockade is promising but untested in CKD. (4) Feasibility: VX-765’s oral bioavailability and repurposing track record de-risks development. CY-09’s novelty is appealing but carries greater translational risk due to unproven renal efficacy and potential off-target ATP-binding liabilities. Thus, VX-765 represents the better-balanced, higher-probability candidate for CKD therapy.",8,"(5, 7)","{'hypothesis': 'VX-765 (Belnacasan; InvivoGen, catalog #tlrl-vg765)', 'answer': 'Proposal for VX-765 (Belnacasan; InvivoGen, catalog #tlrl-vg765)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nVX-765 (Belnacasan) is an orally bioavailable small‐molecule prodrug that is metabolized in vivo to yield the active metabolite VRT-043198, a selective irreversible inhibitor of inflammatory caspase‐1. It belongs to the class of caspase-1 inhibitors, which are designed to target the proteolytic enzyme caspase‐1 responsible for the post-translational processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Originally discovered through efforts to identify small molecules that could modulate inflammasome-mediated inflammation, VX-765 was synthesized to covalently interact with the catalytic cysteine residue of caspase‐1 and thereby block its activity. This group of compounds is part of a broader category of anti-inflammatory agents that have been applied in conditions where excessive inflammasome activation leads to tissue damage, and they have been used in clinical studies for disorders such as epilepsy and psoriasis, demonstrating that this drug class can effectively modulate immune signaling pathways and cytokine maturation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nVX-765 has an established history in preclinical and early clinical research. It has advanced into Phase II trials in both epilepsy and psoriasis, conditions associated with chronic inflammation and abnormal cytokine signaling, thereby establishing a safety profile and demonstrating adequate target engagement in humans. Although it has not been widely evaluated in clinical trials specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), preclinical studies conducted in rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) have demonstrated that VX-765 effectively reduces markers of inflammation such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), diminishes macrophage infiltration, and reduces collagen deposition, which are indicative of reduced fibrotic remodeling in the kidney (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024). Additionally, the general class of caspase-1 inhibitors has been successfully applied in various inflammatory conditions, and mechanistic studies suggest that inhibiting caspase-1 can interrupt the cascade leading to pyroptotic cell death—a key factor in inflammatory tissue damage. Although there is no large-scale clinical trial data in CKD to date, the compound’s mechanism, coupled with existing human safety data from other indications, strongly supports its rapid repurposing potential for kidney diseases (Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nVX-765’s mechanism of action is centered on the selective inhibition of caspase-1, an essential enzyme involved in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, and in mediating a form of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that VX-765 is a prodrug that is metabolized into VRT-043198, which binds irreversibly to the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys285) in the active site of caspase-1 through covalent interactions. Structural analyses, including crystallography experiments, have elucidated that VRT-043198 makes additional hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with key residues (e.g., R179, Q283, P343, and R383) ensuring a high degree of selectivity for inflammatory caspases over apoptotic caspases (Yang, 2019). By blocking caspase-1, VX-765 prevents the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active cytokine forms, thereby reducing the release of these potent inflammatory mediators; it also prevents the cleavage of gasdermin D, a critical effector protein required to form membrane pores that mediate pyroptotic cell death. In renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and other cell types implicated in kidney disease, such proclivity for pyroptosis can drive local inflammatory cascades and fibrotic signaling, so inhibiting caspase-1 may mitigate these processes (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). The specificity of VX-765 for caspase-1 has been confirmed through both in vitro assays—with assessments of IL-1β release and gasdermin D cleavage—and in vivo models where administration of VX-765 led to reduced serum IL-1β, improved survival in sepsis models, and attenuation of inflammatory tissue injury (Yang, 2019; Liu et al., 2023).\n\nExpected Effect in Chronic Kidney Disease:  \nIn the context of Chronic Kidney Disease, particularly conditions characterized by diabetic nephropathy and renal fibrosis, the hypothesis is that VX-765 will reduce caspase-1 mediated pyroptosis and subsequent inflammatory cytokine release in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). TEC pyroptosis contributes to tubular cell death and triggers a deleterious inflammatory milieu that ultimately drives fibrotic remodeling through the activation of myofibroblasts and increased deposition of extracellular matrix components such as collagen. VX-765 is expected to block this cascade at an early step by preventing the activation of caspase-1, thereby limiting IL-1β and IL-18 maturation and secretion. This, in turn, should reduce the recruitment and activation of inflammatory macrophages—a process that has been shown to contribute to fibrogenesis in the kidney (Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Preclinical evidence from rodent models supports that administration of VX-765 leads to decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced expression of pro-fibrotic markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and a lower deposition of collagen, thereby preserving renal tubular structure and function. Considering caspase-1 and the inflammasome complex are expressed in renal cells including TECs and resident macrophages, targeting caspase-1 is a rational approach to interrupt the feedback loop between cell death and inflammation that exacerbates CKD progression (Zhou & Li, 2023; Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of VX-765 as a therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease include its well-defined mechanism of action, oral bioavailability, and the fact that it has already undergone Phase II clinical trials in other indications, demonstrating an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in humans. The mechanistic rationale is strong: by targeting caspase-1, VX-765 interrupts the inflammasome-driven cascade responsible for both pyroptotic cell death and the maturation of key pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in renal fibrosis. Preclinical models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction have provided promising evidence that caspase-1 inhibition can reduce renal inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and extracellular matrix deposition, suggesting that VX-765 might slow the progression of fibrotic changes in CKD (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). Furthermore, targeting a central mediator such as caspase-1 may have broader benefits by influencing several downstream inflammatory pathways simultaneously, thus potentially overcoming the limitations of therapies that target individual cytokines.  \nWeaknesses include the translational gap that currently exists between preclinical efficacy in rodent models and clinical benefit in human CKD patients. Although VX-765 has demonstrated safety in epilepsy and psoriasis trials, the long-term effects of inhibiting caspase-1 in a chronic disease setting like CKD are not fully understood, particularly given the complex roles that inflammasome signaling may play in tissue repair, host defense, and kidney homeostasis. There is also the possibility that fully inhibiting caspase-1 could lead to compensatory activation of alternative inflammatory pathways or unintended off-target effects, especially in patients with compromised kidney function. Additionally, while preclinical data are encouraging, there is a need for dedicated clinical trials in CKD and related fibrotic conditions to establish the optimal dosing, efficacy, and safety profile in this specific patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).  \nOverall, VX-765 exhibits several promising attributes as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for CKD: its defined molecular target, demonstrated anti-inflammatory mechanism through caspase-1 inhibition, and supportive preclinical evidence of renoprotection provide a compelling rationale for further investigation. The strengths of existing human safety data and oral administration combine with a robust mechanistic framework to justify advancing VX-765 into clinical trials in patients with CKD. Nonetheless, further research is required to clarify long-term effects on renal function, potential compensatory inflammatory mechanisms, and the detailed pharmacodynamics in the setting of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. With carefully designed clinical studies focusing on renal endpoints, VX-765 could represent a valuable addition to the therapeutic arsenal against CKD, particularly for patients whose disease is driven significantly by inflammasome-mediated inflammation and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

Chemically, CY-09 belongs to the class of thiazolidinone derivatives, a category known for its capacity to interfere with enzymatic activities via covalent or non-covalent interactions. Its development was driven by the need to specifically target the ATP-binding site within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, particularly focusing on the Walker A motif—a conserved nucleotide-binding region that is essential for the ATPase activity required for NLRP3 oligomerization. The design rationale behind CY-09 was based on structure-based drug design principles, where the compound was engineered to directly bind NLRP3, thereby preventing the conformational changes necessary for inflammasome assembly. This chemical class has previously been used in various contexts to modulate protein–enzyme interactions, and its application in inflammasome biology represents an evolution of this approach to target excessive inflammation mediated by the innate immune system (Jiang et al., 2017; Bertinaria et al., 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of CY-09 is rooted in preclinical studies where it has been extensively characterized in vitro and in animal models of inflammatory diseases. Initially, CY-09 demonstrated potent inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in murine bone marrow–derived macrophages stimulated with canonical activators such as ATP, nigericin, and monosodium urate crystals, showing a dose-dependent reduction in IL-1β secretion and caspase-1 activation. Its efficacy has been documented in rodent models of sepsis and colitis, as well as in metabolic disorder models where NLRP3-driven inflammation is a core pathological feature. Although no clinical trials having been completed in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) specifically have been reported to date, the compound’s inclusion in multiple clinical trial searches (ClinicalTrials.gov) indicates that there is active interest in repurposing or further evaluating NLRP3 inhibitors like CY-09 in kidney-related conditions. Furthermore, the extensive body of work demonstrating that NLRP3 knockout or pharmacological inhibition confers protection against renal fibrosis, tubular inflammation, and other hallmarks of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Zhou & Li, 2023) supports the translational potential of a molecule such as CY-09. Historically, similar NLRP3 inhibitors (for example, MCC950) have been applied in various preclinical models of inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and their protective effects in conditions like diabetic nephropathy and ischemia-reperfusion injury provide a strong rationale for applying CY-09 in CKD (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nCY-09 exerts its therapeutic action by directly binding to the NLRP3 protein at its NACHT domain, specifically targeting the Walker A (or P-loop) motif responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis. This binding event competitively inhibits ATP from accessing the site, thereby blocking the ATPase activity essential for NLRP3 oligomerization. Without ATP hydrolysis, NLRP3 is unable to undergo the conformational rearrangements necessary for the aggregation of multiple NLRP3 molecules into the inflammasome complex. Consequently, the formation of the adaptor protein ASC specks is prevented, leading to a blockade of pro-caspase-1 activation and subsequent cleavage into its active form. This chain of events ultimately results in a reduction of the maturation and secretion of the central proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and it halts gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis—a form of lytic, inflammatory cell death that substantially contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis in CKD. Importantly, studies have demonstrated that CY-09 does not interfere with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, underscoring its molecular specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2019). The molecular interaction of CY-09 is supported by biotinylated pull-down assays which confirm its selective binding to NLRP3 over other inflammasome components, and computational docking models corroborate a binding mode that is competitive with ATP at the Walker A motif (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017). This detailed molecular mechanism signifies that CY-09 operates at an early and critical step in the inflammasome pathway, making it a highly attractive candidate for diseases with a significant inflammatory component, such as CKD (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe proposed hypothesis for applying CY-09 to CKD is that by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in human proximal tubular epithelial cells, the compound will inhibit ATPase-driven oligomerization of NLRP3, thereby reducing the formation of ASC specks, the activation of caspase-1, and the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. The downstream effect of blocking these events is the inhibition of gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis, which is known to drive tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrotic remodeling—a central hallmark in the progression of CKD. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, NLRP3 is expressed and activated in response to various stress stimuli, including oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and metabolic dysregulation, all of which are common in CKD pathogenesis. By impeding this pathway, CY-09 is expected to diminish inflammatory cytokine secretion and reduce cell death, thereby preserving tubular integrity, minimizing interstitial inflammation, and preventing the fibrotic changes that culminate in renal function decline (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Data from preclinical models of kidney injury, such as those using MCC950 and other NLRP3 knockout models, have consistently shown improvements in renal structure and function, and reduction in profibrotic markers upon inhibition of the NLRP3 pathway (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017). Furthermore, oral bioavailability and a favorable safety profile in rodent studies enhance the clinical feasibility of CY-09 as a repurposed agent for CKD (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The expected effects in a CKD model would therefore include reduced extracellular matrix deposition, lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the renal interstitium, and overall attenuation of the fibrotic process, translating ultimately into stabilization of renal function (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nBased on the comprehensive literature review, CY-09 emerges as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease. One of its greatest strengths lies in its robust and specific mechanism of action; by directly binding to the Walker A motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3, CY-09 efficiently prevents the initial ATP-driven steps that are critical for inflammasome assembly. This targeted inhibition ensures that downstream activation events—namely ASC speck formation, caspase-1 activation, and subsequent IL-1β/IL-18 maturation—are effectively suppressed. Such specificity is critical for minimizing off-target effects, as CY-09 has shown no significant interference with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, which could reduce undesirable immunosuppressive side effects (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The repurposing strategy is further supported by extensive preclinical evidence indicating that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 results in marked protection against renal fibrosis and inflammation in various CKD models. The preclinical efficacy of similar NLRP3 inhibitors such as MCC950 in models of diabetic nephropathy, cisplatin-induced renal injury, and ischemia-reperfusion injury reinforces the therapeutic potential of targeting NLRP3 in kidney disease (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017).\n\nAnother significant strength of CY-09 is its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile in rodent studies, which is an important consideration for chronic administration required in CKD therapy (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). This pharmacokinetic profile, along with the compound’s high potency in inflammatory assays where nanomolar inhibitory effects have been observed, provides confidence that CY-09 could achieve therapeutically effective concentrations in the kidney without systemic toxicity.\n\nHowever, there are also challenges and uncertainties. Although extensive preclinical studies in inflammatory disease models support the potential of CY-09, direct evidence of its efficacy in chronic kidney disease models specifically remains limited. The majority of studies to date have focused on sepsis, metabolic disorders, and murine colitis rather than on kidney-specific outcomes. There is, therefore, a need for more targeted preclinical research in CKD models—including those mimicking diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and cisplatin-induced renal fibrosis—to definitively establish the renoprotective effects of CY-09 (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Additionally, while the mechanism is well-characterized in immune cells like macrophages, further studies need to elucidate its effects specifically in human proximal tubular epithelial cells and other renal cell types that contribute to CKD progression. Such studies should evaluate not only biochemical markers of inflammasome activation but also functional outcomes like proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate, and histological indices of fibrosis.\n\nAnother potential weakness concerns the translational gap between rodent models and human CKD. The pathophysiology of CKD is multifactorial, and while NLRP3-mediated inflammation is a key driver, the disease process involves many convergent signaling pathways including TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling and oxidative stress pathways. It is possible that the blockade of NLRP3 alone may not be sufficient to fully arrest disease progression in humans. In addition, although CY-09 appears selective based on current evidence, there is always the risk of off-target effects when a compound modulates ATPase activity, given the abundance of ATP-binding proteins in the cell. Careful profiling of CY-09 against a broad spectrum of other ATPases and kinases will be necessary to confirm its selectivity in a clinical setting (Sandall et al., 2020).\n\nIn summary, CY-09 represents an innovative and mechanistically compelling therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease due to its direct inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a central mediator of renal inflammation and fibrosis. Its synthesis as a thiazolidinone derivative and its proven ability to bind the Walker A motif within the NACHT domain underscore its potential to precisely block inflammasome-driven pyroptosis. Preclinical evidence from models of various inflammatory conditions, along with robust biochemical data demonstrating nanomolar potency in macrophage assays, provides a strong rationale for its repurposing in kidney disease. Furthermore, its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety in rodent studies enhance its translational appeal. Nonetheless, additional research is needed to specifically validate its efficacy in CKD models, assess its long-term safety, and determine its pharmacodynamic effects in kidney-specific cell types such as proximal tubular epithelial cells. Overall, the strengths of CY-09’s targeted mechanism, coupled with supportive preclinical efficacy data from related inflammatory models, make it a promising candidate for further development and evaluation in Chronic Kidney Disease (ClinicalTrials.gov; Jiang et al., 2017; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nBertinaria, M., Gastaldi, S., Marini, E., & Giorgis, M.

"(VX-765, 5)","(A-438079, 2)","Candidate 1, A-438079, is a selective P2X7 receptor antagonist with strong mechanistic rationale for inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation upstream via blocking ATP-induced K+ efflux. It has shown efficacy in acute kidney injury models (cisplatin nephrotoxicity, sepsis-induced AKI) and robust in vitro potency (IC50 ~40 nM). However, its evidence in chronic kidney disease (CKD) models is indirect, and some rodent studies show species-dependent variability and compensatory pathways limiting translational confidence. No clinical safety or PK data in humans with CKD exist, and P2X7 antagonists have had mixed outcomes clinically. Candidate 2, VX-765, is a prodrug caspase-1 inhibitor with detailed structural understanding of covalent active-site binding and selectivity. It directly blocks inflammasome effector caspase-1, preventing both IL-1β/IL-18 maturation and pyroptosis via gasdermin D, a central downstream node in inflammation and fibrosis. It has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical CKD models (diabetic nephropathy, UUO) with reduced cytokines, macrophage infiltration, and collagen deposition. Crucially, VX-765 has advanced through Phase II trials in epilepsy and psoriasis, establishing oral bioavailability, tolerability, and human safety. Although long-term CKD data are pending, the combination of human safety data, direct MoA targeting of inflammasome effectors, and CKD-relevant preclinical evidence outweighs the upstream but less validated P2X7 approach of A-438079.","VX-765 is superior because it targets the central effector caspase-1 in the inflammasome pathway with irreversible, high-selectivity inhibition, translating preclinical efficacy into CKD-relevant models and backed by established Phase II human safety and oral dosing. In contrast, A-438079 blocks an upstream receptor with variable species responses, lacks clinical safety data, and has limited evidence in true chronic kidney injury models. The direct, clinically validated mechanism, favorable PK, and existing human experience with VX-765 give it a substantially higher probability of successful translation into a viable CKD therapy.",9,"(2, 5)","{'hypothesis': 'A-438079 (Tocris, catalog #2947)', 'answer': 'Proposal for A-438079 (Tocris, catalog #2947)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nA-438079 is a synthetic small‐molecule antagonist originally developed as a selective inhibitor of the P2X7 receptor, a ligand‐gated ion channel known to be activated by high concentrations of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The compound belongs to a class of agents that includes disubstituted tetrazoles and cyanoguanidine derivatives, which have been characterized by their ability to selectively block P2X7 receptor activation without significantly affecting other P2X subtypes. Its design and synthesis were initially achieved by pharmaceutical research groups (notably Abbott Laboratories as indicated in early publications) and have since been commercialized by companies such as Tocris (catalog #2947). This class of compounds was originally optimized for studies in inflammatory processes and pain models, as they inhibit ATP‐induced ion flux such as calcium influx and potassium efflux, a key factor in the activation cascade of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nBiochemically and pharmacologically, A-438079 has been investigated in various preclinical models for its ability to mitigate inflammation. It has demonstrated efficacy in rodent models of neuropathic pain and inflammatory conditions by inhibiting P2X7-mediated IL-1β release. In terms of renal applications, there is evidence from several studies that selective P2X7 antagonism can protect against kidney insults such as ischemia-reperfusion injury and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. For example, Zhang et al. (2014) showed that blocking P2X7 with antagonists like A-438079 attenuated cisplatin-induced renal tubular damage by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis markers in mice (Zhang et al., 2014). Additionally, studies such as those by Arulkumaran (2016) and colleagues have demonstrated that while genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of P2X7 in some models does not always equate to improved renal function, the block of P2X7-related signaling reduces inflammasome activation and cytokine release in immune cells and tubular epithelium (Arulkumaran, 2016; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Even though A-438079 has not been widely tested clinically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), its pharmacological profile as a P2X7 antagonist has been well characterized in biochemical studies and preclinical kidney injury models. This builds an indirect but strong rationale for repurposing it in CKD contexts, where sustained inflammation and fibrosis are major pathogenic drivers (Birch et al., 2013; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe primary mechanism of A-438079 is its high-affinity, selective antagonism of the P2X7 receptor. The P2X7 receptor is unique among the P2X family in its requirement for high concentrations of ATP, which are typically achieved in pathological conditions involving cell injury and inflammation. Under normal conditions, extracellular ATP levels are low; however, during tissue damage, ATP is released into the extracellular space where it binds to and activates P2X7 receptors expressed on immune cells (especially macrophages) and renal tubular epithelial cells (Han et al., 2020; Howarth, 2020).  \n\nUpon binding of ATP to the receptor, P2X7 undergoes a conformational change that opens its ion channel, permitting the influx of calcium ions and the efflux of potassium ions. This potassium efflux is a critical upstream event that triggers the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex responsible for activating caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 then cleaves the precursors of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature, secreted forms. These cytokines play major roles in propagating inflammatory signals, inducing pyroptosis (a form of inflammatory cell death), and promoting fibrotic remodeling in affected tissues (Qian et al., 2021; Shokoples, 2022).\n\nA-438079 interacts with the P2X7 receptor by competitively inhibiting ATP binding, thereby preventing the channel’s conformational change and subsequent ion flux. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) is approximately 40 nM in rodent models, indicating high potency (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). By blocking this pathway, A-438079 inhibits downstream events including NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 cleavage, and the release of IL-1β, ultimately reducing inflammatory responses and preventing the activation of fibrotic signaling pathways in kidney tissue, particularly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells where P2X7 and NLRP3 are highly expressed (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the context of chronic kidney disease, the principal pathological mechanisms include persistent inflammation and fibrosis, processes that are significantly driven by inflammasome activation in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. The hypothesis postulates that A-438079 will block ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor in these cell types. By doing so, it prevents the crucial potassium efflux that is necessary for the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The expected downstream effects include a reduction in caspase-1 activation, decreased cleavage of pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β, and ultimately lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This chain of events is anticipated to reduce pyroptosis and curb the progression of fibrosis within the kidney (Qian et al., 2021; Arulkumaran et al., 2018).\n\nRenal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells are known to express both the P2X7 receptor and NLRP3, as evidenced by various studies outlining their roles in mediating inflammation-driven fibrosis in CKD (Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020). In assays, it is expected that treatment with A-438079 would result in a measurable decrease in IL-1β release, reduced markers of inflammation such as caspase-1 activity, and potentially lower expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components. Furthermore, by blunting chronic inflammatory responses, A-438079 may help to preserve kidney structure and function, thereby slowing the progression of CKD. The compound’s favorable pharmacokinetic properties—particularly its demonstrated bioavailability and minimal off-target effects—support the feasibility of achieving these outcomes (Burnstock, 2017).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nA-438079 presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on several factors. One of its major strengths lies in its selectivity and potency as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, which allows it to precisely target an upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that is centrally implicated in CKD. The ability of A-438079 to block ATP-induced ion flux is particularly compelling because it interrupts the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a known driver of IL-1β and IL-18 release in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells (Arulkumaran, 2016; Qian et al., 2021). This molecular specificity holds promise for reducing inflammation and subsequent fibrotic formation in the kidney, both of which are critical elements in CKD progression.\n\nThe preclinical evidence supporting the use of P2X7 antagonists in models of acute kidney injury, such as cisplatin nephrotoxicity and sepsis-induced renal injury, provides additional rationale, even though such models are not perfect surrogates for CKD (Zhang et al., 2014; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Some studies have demonstrated that selective P2X7 blockade can attenuate inflammatory cytokine production, improve renal function markers, and reduce cell death, thereby supporting the hypothesis that similar benefits could be realized in chronic inflammatory settings like CKD (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nAdditionally, the mechanistic details of P2X7 receptor signaling – requiring high extracellular ATP concentrations, initiating K+ efflux, and triggering inflammasome assembly – align closely with the known processes of renal inflammation and fibrosis. The fact that P2X7 and NLRP3 are co-expressed in key renal cell populations reinforces the logic behind using A-438079 to target these pathways (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and potential challenges that need to be considered. Firstly, in some preclinical models, especially in certain rat strains (as noted by studies involving P2X7 receptor knockout rats), the inhibition or deletion of P2X7 did not significantly alter renal function or prevent kidney injury induced by hypertensive factors such as angiotensin II (Nespoux et al., 2024). This suggests that compensatory pathways may exist, and the role of P2X7 might be context-dependent or vary among species. Secondly, clinical trials of P2X7 antagonists in other inflammatory diseases have had mixed outcomes, raising concerns about translational efficacy in human CKD (Luz et al., 2019). Moreover, while the mechanism of inflammasome inhibition is well understood in vitro, the in vivo pharmacodynamics in the kidney may be complicated by variable local ATP concentrations and the dynamic expression of the receptor in disease states.\n\nFrom a drug development standpoint, the potency (IC50 ~40 nM) and reported good bioavailability of A-438079 are advantageous. Its minimal off-target effects also reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions in clinical translation. However, more robust and specific data in CKD models are necessary to establish whether the attenuation of IL-1β release can consistently translate into meaningful improvements in renal fibrosis and overall kidney function over long-term treatment courses (Chen et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2024).\n\nIn summary, A-438079’s targeted inhibition of the P2X7 receptor offers a novel approach to halt the ATP-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby mitigating a key upstream trigger of inflammatory cascades in CKD. Its preclinical track record in inflammatory and renal injury models, combined with its mechanistic specificity, positions it as a strong candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease. Nonetheless, species variability, redundant inflammatory pathways, and the need for further in vivo validation in models of long-term kidney disease remain potential hurdles. If these challenges are addressed in further preclinical and early clinical studies, A-438079 could represent a significant advance in targeting the inflammation-fibrosis axis in CKD (Arulkumaran et al., 2018; Fantauzzi, 2013; Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe strengths of A-438079 for CKD include its high potency, selectivity, and well-elucidated mechanism of action in blocking ATP-induced P2X7 receptor activation—a critical initiator of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. These molecular interactions have been robustly characterized in multiple preclinical studies, indicating that the drug may effectively reduce IL-1β-mediated inflammation and subsequent fibrotic responses. In models of acute renal injury, antagonizing P2X7 has led to reduced cell death and improved renal function, which supports its potential usage in CKD where chronic inflammation is a driver of progressive fibrosis. Moreover, the chemical class to which A-438079 belongs has been extensively employed in studies of inflammatory diseases, reinforcing the feasibility of this approach (Deplano, 2012; Qian et al., 2021).\n\nConversely, potential weaknesses lie in the heterogeneity of experimental outcomes across different preclinical models and species. Some studies have shown that genetic deletion of P2X7 in rats does not always confer renal protection in induced kidney injury, suggesting that the pathophysiology in certain species—or even specific CKD etiologies—may be driven by redundant pathways beyond P2X7/NLRP3. In addition, although A-438079 demonstrates promising in vitro efficacy, there remains a critical need for long-term in vivo studies specifically in CKD models to verify that its anti-inflammatory effects translate into clinically meaningful outcomes in terms of preservation of renal function and reduction in fibrosis. Lastly, it is important to consider potential compensatory mechanisms in chronic inflammation that may limit the sole efficacy of P2X7 inhibition (Nespoux et al., 2024; Luz et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, A-438079 is a scientifically compelling therapeutic candidate for CKD, with robust mechanistic support and significant preclinical evidence in inflammatory models. Its ability to target the P2X7/NLRP3 axis addresses a novel therapeutic area in CKD by potentially halting the progression of inflammation-driven fibrosis. However, potential limitations due to species-specific responses and redundancy in inflammatory signaling must be carefully evaluated in future studies. Overall, A-438079 merits further investigation as part of a multi-pronged approach to modulate inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in chronic kidney disease (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:  \nArulkumaran, N.

It belongs to the class of caspase-1 inhibitors, which are designed to target the proteolytic enzyme caspase‐1 responsible for the post-translational processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Originally discovered through efforts to identify small molecules that could modulate inflammasome-mediated inflammation, VX-765 was synthesized to covalently interact with the catalytic cysteine residue of caspase‐1 and thereby block its activity. This group of compounds is part of a broader category of anti-inflammatory agents that have been applied in conditions where excessive inflammasome activation leads to tissue damage, and they have been used in clinical studies for disorders such as epilepsy and psoriasis, demonstrating that this drug class can effectively modulate immune signaling pathways and cytokine maturation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nVX-765 has an established history in preclinical and early clinical research. It has advanced into Phase II trials in both epilepsy and psoriasis, conditions associated with chronic inflammation and abnormal cytokine signaling, thereby establishing a safety profile and demonstrating adequate target engagement in humans. Although it has not been widely evaluated in clinical trials specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), preclinical studies conducted in rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) have demonstrated that VX-765 effectively reduces markers of inflammation such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), diminishes macrophage infiltration, and reduces collagen deposition, which are indicative of reduced fibrotic remodeling in the kidney (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024). Additionally, the general class of caspase-1 inhibitors has been successfully applied in various inflammatory conditions, and mechanistic studies suggest that inhibiting caspase-1 can interrupt the cascade leading to pyroptotic cell death—a key factor in inflammatory tissue damage. Although there is no large-scale clinical trial data in CKD to date, the compound’s mechanism, coupled with existing human safety data from other indications, strongly supports its rapid repurposing potential for kidney diseases (Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nVX-765’s mechanism of action is centered on the selective inhibition of caspase-1, an essential enzyme involved in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, and in mediating a form of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that VX-765 is a prodrug that is metabolized into VRT-043198, which binds irreversibly to the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys285) in the active site of caspase-1 through covalent interactions. Structural analyses, including crystallography experiments, have elucidated that VRT-043198 makes additional hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with key residues (e.g., R179, Q283, P343, and R383) ensuring a high degree of selectivity for inflammatory caspases over apoptotic caspases (Yang, 2019). By blocking caspase-1, VX-765 prevents the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active cytokine forms, thereby reducing the release of these potent inflammatory mediators; it also prevents the cleavage of gasdermin D, a critical effector protein required to form membrane pores that mediate pyroptotic cell death. In renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and other cell types implicated in kidney disease, such proclivity for pyroptosis can drive local inflammatory cascades and fibrotic signaling, so inhibiting caspase-1 may mitigate these processes (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). The specificity of VX-765 for caspase-1 has been confirmed through both in vitro assays—with assessments of IL-1β release and gasdermin D cleavage—and in vivo models where administration of VX-765 led to reduced serum IL-1β, improved survival in sepsis models, and attenuation of inflammatory tissue injury (Yang, 2019; Liu et al., 2023).\n\nExpected Effect in Chronic Kidney Disease:  \nIn the context of Chronic Kidney Disease, particularly conditions characterized by diabetic nephropathy and renal fibrosis, the hypothesis is that VX-765 will reduce caspase-1 mediated pyroptosis and subsequent inflammatory cytokine release in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). TEC pyroptosis contributes to tubular cell death and triggers a deleterious inflammatory milieu that ultimately drives fibrotic remodeling through the activation of myofibroblasts and increased deposition of extracellular matrix components such as collagen. VX-765 is expected to block this cascade at an early step by preventing the activation of caspase-1, thereby limiting IL-1β and IL-18 maturation and secretion. This, in turn, should reduce the recruitment and activation of inflammatory macrophages—a process that has been shown to contribute to fibrogenesis in the kidney (Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Preclinical evidence from rodent models supports that administration of VX-765 leads to decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced expression of pro-fibrotic markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and a lower deposition of collagen, thereby preserving renal tubular structure and function. Considering caspase-1 and the inflammasome complex are expressed in renal cells including TECs and resident macrophages, targeting caspase-1 is a rational approach to interrupt the feedback loop between cell death and inflammation that exacerbates CKD progression (Zhou & Li, 2023; Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of VX-765 as a therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease include its well-defined mechanism of action, oral bioavailability, and the fact that it has already undergone Phase II clinical trials in other indications, demonstrating an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in humans. The mechanistic rationale is strong: by targeting caspase-1, VX-765 interrupts the inflammasome-driven cascade responsible for both pyroptotic cell death and the maturation of key pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in renal fibrosis. Preclinical models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction have provided promising evidence that caspase-1 inhibition can reduce renal inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and extracellular matrix deposition, suggesting that VX-765 might slow the progression of fibrotic changes in CKD (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). Furthermore, targeting a central mediator such as caspase-1 may have broader benefits by influencing several downstream inflammatory pathways simultaneously, thus potentially overcoming the limitations of therapies that target individual cytokines.  \nWeaknesses include the translational gap that currently exists between preclinical efficacy in rodent models and clinical benefit in human CKD patients. Although VX-765 has demonstrated safety in epilepsy and psoriasis trials, the long-term effects of inhibiting caspase-1 in a chronic disease setting like CKD are not fully understood, particularly given the complex roles that inflammasome signaling may play in tissue repair, host defense, and kidney homeostasis. There is also the possibility that fully inhibiting caspase-1 could lead to compensatory activation of alternative inflammatory pathways or unintended off-target effects, especially in patients with compromised kidney function. Additionally, while preclinical data are encouraging, there is a need for dedicated clinical trials in CKD and related fibrotic conditions to establish the optimal dosing, efficacy, and safety profile in this specific patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).  \nOverall, VX-765 exhibits several promising attributes as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for CKD: its defined molecular target, demonstrated anti-inflammatory mechanism through caspase-1 inhibition, and supportive preclinical evidence of renoprotection provide a compelling rationale for further investigation. The strengths of existing human safety data and oral administration combine with a robust mechanistic framework to justify advancing VX-765 into clinical trials in patients with CKD. Nonetheless, further research is required to clarify long-term effects on renal function, potential compensatory inflammatory mechanisms, and the detailed pharmacodynamics in the setting of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. With carefully designed clinical studies focusing on renal endpoints, VX-765 could represent a valuable addition to the therapeutic arsenal against CKD, particularly for patients whose disease is driven significantly by inflammasome-mediated inflammation and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

"(Brilliant Blue G, 1)","(INF4E, 4)","Candidate 1 (Brilliant Blue G, BBG) offers a rich preclinical evidence base in CKD‐relevant models (UUO, hypertensive nephropathy, lupus nephritis) demonstrating reduction of inflammation, fibrosis, and pyroptosis via P2X7 antagonism and downstream NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. Its safety and tolerability are well established from surgical and CNS applications, with known water solubility, scalable manufacture, and favorable PK for repurposing. Negative findings regarding P2X7 independence in some glomerulonephritis models highlight potential pathway redundancy, but abundant in vivo CKD data offset this risk. Candidate 2 (INF4E) features a highly specific, covalent mechanism directly targeting NLRP3 with submicromolar potency and oral bioavailability in rodents, representing a novel approach to block hypoxia‐driven inflammasome activation in proximal tubular cells. However, INF4E lacks any direct CKD animal data or clinical safety profile, and its irreversible electrophilic chemistry brings off‐target and cytotoxicity concerns. Its preclinical history is strong in non‐renal inflammatory contexts but unproven in CKD. While INF4E’s MoA is mechanistically elegant and specific, the scarcity of disease‐relevant efficacy, unknown renal delivery/PK in humans, and safety liabilities lower its translational probability relative to BBG.","Between the two candidates, BBG demonstrates a stronger and more CKD‐direct relevance with multiple rodent models showing renoprotection, established human safety, clear feasibility for rapid repurposing, and only moderate mechanistic uncertainties due to inflammasome redundancy. INF4E, although mechanistically specific and novel for direct NLRP3 blockade, lacks any CKD efficacy data, has uncertain PK/ADME in kidney, and carries irreversible covalent liabilities that may hinder safety and regulatory progression. Therefore, BBG has a higher probability of successful experimental outcome and eventual translation into a viable CKD therapy.",10,"(1, 4)","{'hypothesis': 'Brilliant Blue G (BBG; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #B0770)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Brilliant Blue G (BBG; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #B0770)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nBrilliant Blue G (BBG) is a synthetic dye originally developed for use in food and as a surgical visualizing agent that has been repurposed as a pharmacological agent. BBG is part of the broad class of blue dyes that have been extensively studied for their ability to interact with the purinergic receptor family, most notably acting as a non‐competitive antagonist of the P2X7 receptor. The compound’s chemical structure confers high water solubility and the ability to be administered at defined doses with a favorable safety profile, as demonstrated by its routine use in ophthalmic surgery and CNS studies without systemic toxicity. In its role as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, BBG has been used in various preclinical studies investigating inflammatory and cell death pathways. Its synthetic origin and established manufacturing process, as offered by suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #B0770), support its scalability for repurposing in chronic diseases. BBG belongs to a class of small molecules that modulate ion channel function, particularly by binding to the ATP‐activated P2X7 receptor, which has been implicated in various inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. This class of compounds has been employed not only for their staining properties but also for their ability to interfere with cellular signaling events related to inflammation, rendering them of considerable interest in conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD) where inflammation and fibrosis are critical pathogenic factors (Ferreira et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nHistorically, Brilliant Blue G has been most widely recognized as a histological staining agent with established safety in both preclinical and clinical contexts, particularly within the neuroprotective field. Its pharmacological actions extend to antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, and preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in animal models of inflammatory diseases, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and various neurodegenerative conditions. More recently, BBG has been evaluated in rodent models of kidney disease. For example, in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) models—a widely used experimental model that mimics tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis—BBG treatment has been observed to reduce inflammation, diminish interstitial fibrosis, and promote tubular cell regeneration (Pereira et al., 2020). In rodent hypertensive nephropathy models, BBG has also been reported to modulate renal vascular resistance and alter tubular injury markers, suggesting that its renoprotective effects might extend to a broader spectrum of CKD–related pathologies. Although clinical trials directly targeting chronic kidney disease with BBG have not yet been detailed in the public literature, searches in ClinicalTrials.gov using terms related to “Brilliant Blue G OR P2X7 antagonist OR P2X7 inhibitor OR NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have identified several ongoing studies investigating similar P2X7 blockade strategies in CKD, which support the translational potential of this approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Prior investigations in animal models of lupus nephritis and hypertensive kidney disease have indicated that BBG’s anti‐inflammatory profile, including decreased IL-1β levels and reduced macrophage infiltration, is conducive to preventing progressive renal damage (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020). Veterinary and preclinical applications in models of inflammatory injury provide a solid foundation for repurposing BBG as a potential therapeutic candidate in conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, such as CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe mechanism by which BBG is hypothesized to exert its renoprotective effects in CKD is centered on its ability to non‐competitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor present on both renal immune and epithelial cells. The P2X7 receptor is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated cation channel that is activated under pathophysiological conditions where extracellular ATP levels are elevated, which frequently occurs during tissue injury and inflammation. Once activated, the P2X7 receptor facilitates the formation of pores in the plasma membrane that allow for the influx of cations and the efflux of cellular contents, thereby precipitating a cascade of intracellular events. One critical downstream consequence of P2X7 activation is the priming and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that, upon activation, recruits the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and pro-caspase-1. This assembly leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase-1, which in turn processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, resulting in their secretion and the amplification of the inflammatory response. Moreover, P2X7 activation can induce pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that further exacerbates tissue injury and inflammation (Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nBBG exerts its effects via a noncompetitive blockade of the P2X7 receptor. In doing so, BBG prevents ATP-induced ion channel opening, thereby blocking the subsequent calcium influx and pore formation that are necessary for downstream inflammasome priming. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that BBG inhibits P2X7 receptor-mediated responses, including the calcium influx and the release of IL-1β from macrophages and other immune cells. In vitro studies with BBG have revealed nanomolar potency in blocking P2X7-mediated activities, which is reflective of its efficacy in dampening the inflammasome-related cytokine cascades (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019). Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that BBG may also interfere with pannexin-1 channels that are thought to facilitate ATP release and further promote inflammasome activation, although the precise relationship between pannexin-1 and P2X7 remains the subject of active research (Ferreira et al., 2016). Consequently, by inhibiting the P2X7 receptor, BBG blocks the ATP-driven initiation of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade. This blockade limits caspase-1 activation and the subsequent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, ultimately reducing local inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrotic remodeling within the renal parenchyma. Evidence from animal models indicates that such inhibition leads to reduced macrophage infiltration, decreased fibrogenic markers, and enhanced tubular cell regeneration, which collectively preserve the integrity of the tubulointerstitial architecture (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the established mechanistic pathway, BBG is expected to exert multifaceted renoprotective effects when applied to models of chronic kidney disease. In the proposed assay evaluating drug effects on renal cells, the expected outcome would involve a significant reduction in ATP-induced inflammasome activation. Specifically, by antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, BBG should lower the levels of active caspase-1, thereby reducing the maturation and extracellular release of IL-1β. This attenuation of inflammasome activation is expected to diminish pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells and mitigate pro-inflammatory cytokine release from resident macrophages. BBG’s inhibition of these pathways would theoretically preserve tubular architecture and limit interstitial fibrosis—a hallmark of progressive CKD. The renoprotective effect is anticipated to be observed as decreased expression of fibrosis markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and heat shock protein-47 (HSP47), as well as reduced collagen deposition, as evidenced in rodent models of UUO and hypertensive nephropathy (Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nAt the molecular level, renal epithelial cells, particularly proximal tubular cells, express both P2X7 receptors and components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Immunohistochemical studies in animal models have demonstrated that under pathological conditions, P2X7 receptor expression is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells and can lead to enhanced production of IL-1β when activated by extracellular ATP (Arulkumaran, 2016; Howarth, 2020). Therefore, BBG is expected to be especially effective in cell types that are critical in the development of inflammation and fibrosis in CKD. By reducing the number of inflammatory cells (such as CD68-positive macrophages) infiltrating the renal parenchyma and by limiting cell death via pyroptosis, BBG may also indirectly reduce the fibrotic signaling that is mediated by cytokines such as TGF-β. This dual effect—both direct inhibition of inflammatory signaling and preservation of renal cell integrity—provides a compelling rationale for BBG’s use in preventing the progression of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nMoreover, BBG’s known safety profile in central nervous system studies and its extensive use as a surgical dye underscore its translational potential. Its water solubility and known pharmacokinetics facilitate dosing strategies that could be adapted for chronic administration in CKD patients. Additionally, the indirect suppression of inflammasome activation through P2X7 antagonism presents a novel approach to modulating the inflammatory microenvironment in the kidney, one that targets a critical nexus of inflammation and fibrosis (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, BBG presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on its ability to noncompetitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor, thereby blocking ATP-induced inflammasome priming and activation. The strengths of BBG include its well-established safety profile, water solubility, and proven efficacy in various rodent models of kidney injury such as hypertensive nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction. Preclinical data indicate that BBG can reduce key mediators of inflammation such as IL-1β, lower caspase-1 activation, and mitigate the deleterious effects of pyroptosis on renal tubular architecture, all of which are central to the pathophysiology of CKD (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain that warrant further investigation. There is limited direct clinical data specifically evaluating BBG in human CKD patients, although the identification of related clinical trials targeting P2X7 and NLRP3 receptors in CKD suggests active interest in this therapeutic approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while BBG’s mechanism of action is well supported by in vitro and animal studies, the potential for differential effects based on receptor splice variants and cell type specificity in renal tissue must be carefully delineated. For instance, recent studies indicate that variations in P2X7 receptor expression and function in the renal vasculature may impact not only inflammatory signaling but also vascular tone, which could influence overall renal perfusion and function (Howarth, 2020).\n\nMoreover, while BBG’s indirect inhibition of the inflammasome pathway via P2X7 antagonism is mechanistically attractive, redundancy in inflammasome activation pathways—such as those that are P2X7-independent—might limit the overall efficacy of BBG as a monotherapy. Some studies have demonstrated that even with effective P2X7 inhibition, alternative pathways may still sustain IL-1β release under inflammatory conditions (Arulkumaran, 2016; Prendecki et al., 2022). Therefore, combination therapies that target multiple nodes in the inflammasome network may ultimately be required to achieve robust clinical benefit.\n\nIn terms of drug development strategies, BBG benefits from its established manufacturing and dosing data, which accelerates early phase clinical trial design and regulatory considerations. In addition, BBG has been successfully used in non-renal contexts—including long-term treatments in models of graft-versus-host disease—without significant toxicity, lending further support to its translational potential (Geraghty et al., 2019). The extensive literature on BBG’s anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in preclinical models provides a solid rationale for advancing this candidate for CKD even as further mechanistic and pharmacodynamic studies are conducted.\n\nWeaknesses of this candidate include the fact that while much of the preclinical data is encouraging, there is still a need for robust clinical trials that specifically assess BBG in CKD. Additionally, given the complexity of CKD pathogenesis—which involves multiple overlapping inflammatory and fibrotic signaling mechanisms—it will be important to determine whether BBG alone can induce sufficient therapeutic benefit or whether it is best applied as part of a combination regimen. Moreover, the potential vascular effects of P2X7 antagonism require further clarification to ensure that systemic hemodynamics are not adversely affected, particularly in patients with existing cardiovascular complications that often accompany CKD (Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall, the mechanistic rationale for BBG centers on its ability to interfere with a critical inflammatory pathway—namely, the ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. This blockade not only reduces the activation of caspase-1 and the release of IL-1β but also limits pyroptotic cell death, preservation of tubular architecture, and ultimately, fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. These effects address key pathogenic mechanisms underlying CKD progression. Moreover, aspects such as its water solubility, known dosing regimens from CNS and surgical applications, and favorable preclinical safety record render BBG an attractive candidate for fast-tracked repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Ferreira et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence reviewed indicates that Brilliant Blue G holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. Its mechanism—centered on noncompetitive antagonism of the P2X7 receptor and consequent suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade—offers a novel approach to preserving renal function by reducing inflammatory injury and fibrosis. While further research, particularly targeted clinical trials in the CKD patient population, is necessary to fully validate its efficacy and safety in this context, the preclinical data and extensive understanding of its molecular interactions support the continued development of BBG for CKD therapy (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nReferences  \nArulkumaran, N.

It is an acrylate derivative belonging to a class of compounds that harness α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl (Michael acceptor) functionalities to achieve covalent, irreversible inhibition of target proteins. Its discovery emerged during screening campaigns that looked for submicromolar potency against NLRP3, with subsequent chemical optimization to balance reactivity and cytotoxicity. Specifically, INF4E (also referred to in some studies as compound 9) was identified for its ability to selectively inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation by binding covalently to the NACHT domain’s ATP‐binding site, thereby interfering with ATP hydrolysis required for the conformational changes that lead to inflammasome assembly (Cocco et al., 2017; Blevins et al., 2022). As a member of the acrylate derivatives class, similar compounds have been explored in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular disorders, where targeting NLRP3 has shown promise. Members of this chemical class have a well‐documented history of being used as selective covalent modifiers with potential in modulating inflammatory signaling cascades.  \n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of INF4E and its related chemical family primarily stems from preclinical studies where they have been shown to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in various models of inflammation. INF4E was originally validated in sepsis models, demonstrating efficacy in reducing systemic inflammation, and subsequent studies extended its utility to show anti‐pyroptotic effects in macrophage cell lines with submicromolar potency. Moreover, related acrylate derivatives have been explored in inflammatory bowel disease models, where modifications to reduce cytotoxicity led to the generation of analogues such as INF39. Although the preclinical literature for this class of inhibitors is robust in the context of sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, and even in models of ischemic injury in the heart, there is no direct literature evidence that INF4E has been specifically used for treating chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis. Searches in Clinical Trials databases for “NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have revealed only nascent clinical exploration of NLRP3 inhibitors in renal disease, with most candidates like MCC950 and OLT1177 being at early development stages (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023). Thus, while INF4E’s mechanism of NLRP3 inhibition is highly relevant to inflammatory processes, its therapeutic history in kidney disease remains limited to preclinical mechanistic rationale rather than established clinical or veterinary use in CKD.  \n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, INF4E exerts its action by covalently binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, specifically targeting its ATP‐binding site. The NACHT domain is essential for NLRP3 oligomerization and subsequent inflammasome assembly. INF4E’s acrylate (Michael acceptor) moiety reacts with cysteine residues present in this domain, thereby irreversibly blocking ATP hydrolysis. The inhibition of ATP hydrolysis interferes directly with the required conformational changes that transform NLRP3 from an inactive to an active state capable of recruiting the adaptor protein ASC and procaspase‐1. Consequently, the subsequent cleavage of caspase‐1 is prevented, which in turn stops the maturation and release of key pro‐inflammatory cytokines, notably IL‐1β and IL‐18 (Mezzaroma et al., 2021; Cocco et al., 2017).  \nThis covalent binding mechanism is particularly significant because it offers prolonged inhibitory effects owing to its irreversible nature. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, where hypoxia serves as a potent priming signal for inflammasome activation and contributes to chronic inflammation and fibrosis, inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E is hypothesized to prevent the cascade leading to caspase‐1 activation, thus mitigating caspase‐1–dependent pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death—and reducing the release of IL‐18 (Blevins et al., 2022; Komada & Muruve, 2019).  \nThe biochemical interactions of INF4E align with the known structure–activity relationships of electrophilic acrylate derivatives, as these compounds are designed to target the ATPase activity of NLRP3. By interfering with this enzymatic function, INF4E halts the nucleation of the inflammasome complex, thereby curtailing downstream signaling that ultimately leads to pyroptosis and fibrogenesis. The short-lived yet potent irreversible binding is a hallmark of this class of inhibitors, which has been exploited in several preclinical studies to provide a potent blockade of inflammation (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the context of the proposed assay and the underlying pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease, INF4E is anticipated to exhibit a therapeutic effect by mitigating hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation in proximal tubular epithelial cells. Hypoxic conditions are known to prime and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in these cells, and this process is a major contributor to tubular cell injury, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenic signaling—all key drivers of CKD progression.  \nThe expected outcome when applying INF4E would be a significant reduction in ATP hydrolysis that is crucial for NLRP3 activation, thereby preventing the subsequent assembly of the inflammasome complex. This inhibition should lead to a decrease in caspase‐1 activity, ultimately lowering the maturation and secretion of IL‐18 (and possibly IL‐1β). Reduced levels of IL‐18 would then limit the inflammatory and fibrogenic signaling cascades that promote the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis. In assays using hypoxic proximal tubular cells, one would therefore predict reduced markers of pyroptosis, improved cell viability, and a lower expression of fibrogenic proteins such as TGF-β and α-SMA.  \nThere is also supportive evidence that NLRP3 is expressed in proximal tubular cells and that its activation is directly linked to inflammatory responses and fibrosis under hypoxic conditions (Ochoa et al., 2023; Komada & Muruve, 2019). The selective inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E should thus translate into improved cellular integrity and a mitigated progression of the inflammatory milieu that typifies CKD. This expected modulation of pyroptosis and fibrosis markers provides a clear biochemical rationale for using INF4E as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic therapeutic candidate in kidney disease models.  \n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe analysis of INF4E as a repurposed drug candidate for chronic kidney disease presents both promising and challenging aspects. One major strength of INF4E lies in its clearly defined mechanism of action; by targeting the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and interfering with ATP hydrolysis, INF4E offers a direct method to abrogate inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. This is particularly relevant in CKD, where hypoxia-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in proximal tubular cells is a key pathological event leading to pyroptosis, inflammation, and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019).  \nAnother strength is its proven submicromolar potency as demonstrated in phenotypic screens, along with a degree of oral bioavailability in rodent models that supports the feasibility of future in vivo investigations (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021). This potency, combined with its specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome, positions INF4E as a candidate with the potential to modulate inflammatory responses without broadly suppressing the entire immune system. Moreover, by specifically reducing IL-18 release, INF4E may offer advantages over broader anti-inflammatory approaches that risk impairing normal host defense mechanisms (Thomas et al., 2022).  \nA potential weakness, however, is the risk associated with irreversible covalent binding, which, while conferring prolonged effects, may also lead to off-target toxicity if the selectivity is not absolute. Some acrylate derivatives have been noted for cytotoxicity issues, and although chemical optimization—such as the development of related compounds like INF39—has been undertaken to alleviate these concerns, it remains a critical point for evaluation in renal cells that are already susceptible to injury under hypoxic conditions (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \nFurthermore, while the mechanistic rationale for targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in CKD is strong, the clinical translation of NLRP3 inhibitors has been slow. Currently, only limited clinical trial data are available for NLRP3 inhibitors in CKD, and the majority of evidence remains at the preclinical level (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023).  \nAnother consideration is that chronic kidney disease is a multifactorial condition wherein inflammasome activation is just one of several pathogenic processes, including metabolic dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and oxidative stress. Therefore, while INF4E may effectively block one critical pathway—namely, hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation—it might need to be combined with therapies targeting other aspects of CKD pathogenesis to achieve a comprehensive therapeutic effect (Unknown Reference; Mulay, 2019).  \nDespite these challenges, INF4E’s selectivity for a mechanistically validated target, its oral availability, and its demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory models provide a strong rationale for further investigation. In assays designed to model hypoxic tubular injury, INF4E is expected to reduce pyroptosis and fibrogenic signaling, thereby slowing CKD progression. The drug’s success in other inflammatory contexts, such as sepsis models, lends additional weight to its potential, although caution must be exercised when extrapolating these data to the complex microenvironment of the kidney (Blevins et al., 2022; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \n\nContinued research should focus on dosing optimization, safety profiling in kidney-specific models, and investigation of combination strategies that target both inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in CKD (Komada & Muruve, 2019; Mulay, 2019; Pagliaro & Penna, 2023; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nOverall, INF4E represents a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for chronic kidney disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, which aligns well with an established pathogenic pathway in CKD—namely, hypoxia-driven NLRP3 inflammasome activation in proximal tubular cells. Its ability to block the ATPase activity of NLRP3, thereby preventing both caspase-1 activation and IL-18 release, underpins a novel strategy aimed at mitigating pyroptosis and subsequent fibrogenic signaling cascades. While challenges such as potential off-target cytotoxicity, the need for extensive in vivo validation in CKD models, and integration into a multifactorial therapeutic approach remain, the compelling preclinical data for related compounds and the rigorous mechanistic underpinnings provide a strong basis for advancing INF4E in further preclinical studies and eventual clinical trials. Continued research should include detailed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological evaluations in renal models, as well as assessments of its efficacy in reducing markers of inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrosis in hypoxic proximal tubular cells. Given the complexity of CKD, INF4E may ultimately be best suited for combination therapy alongside agents addressing complementary pathogenic mechanisms. Overall, the potential strengths of INF4E—rooted in its selective, irreversible inhibition of a well‐validated molecular target—are balanced by the need for careful evaluation of safety and clinical translatability in the setting of chronic kidney disease (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nReferences:  \nBlevins, H.

"(Oridonin, 6)","(INF4E, 4)","Both INF4E (ID: 4) and oridonin (ID: 6) target the NLRP3 inflammasome by covalent modification of its NACHT domain, aiming to block ATPase‐driven oligomerization and downstream caspase‐1 activation. Strength of evidence is greater for oridonin, which has demonstrated renoprotective efficacy in multiple rodent models of kidney injury, including diabetic nephropathy and ischemia–reperfusion acute kidney injury, with markers of reduced inflammation, fibrosis, and improved functional parameters. By contrast, INF4E’s evidence is largely limited to macrophage and systemic inflammation models (sepsis, IBD, cardiovascular injury) with no direct CKD or renal fibrosis data.

Mechanistically, both compounds covalently engage cysteine residues in the NACHT domain, but oridonin’s target residue (Cys279) and its blockade of NEK7 binding have been elucidated in macrophages and shown to translate to renal cell contexts. Oridonin also modulates NF-κB, p38-MAPK, and Nrf2 pathways, offering pleiotropic cytoprotective effects. INF4E’s MoA is clear but narrowly confined to NLRP3 and has not been corroborated in renal cells.

Safety and tolerability favor oridonin: it is a natural product with centuries of traditional use and existing preclinical safety data, whereas INF4E is an irreversible acrylate electrophile classically associated with off-target cytotoxicity, lacking any clinical or advanced preclinical toxicology in kidney models.

In terms of feasibility, oridonin has been dosed orally in rodents with demonstrable PK/PD support in CKD‐relevant settings, while INF4E’s ADME/PK characterization in renal disease is minimal. Both have challenges—INF4E around off-target reactivity, oridonin around solubility and moderate potency—but oridonin’s prior renal work reduces translational risk.

Scientific novelty is somewhat higher for INF4E as a synthetic optimized acrylate, but novelty without disease‐specific validation and safety carries risk. Oridonin balances known safety, direct CKD relevance, and mechanistic depth, making it the stronger candidate for further development in CKD.","Oridonin (ID: 6) is superior because it combines robust preclinical efficacy in kidney disease models, a well-characterized mechanism of covalent NLRP3 inhibition in relevant cell types, and a favorable translational safety profile derived from traditional use and existing rodent data. In contrast, INF4E (ID: 4) lacks any direct CKD‐specific efficacy data, carries higher off-target toxicity risk due to its electrophilic warhead, and has only systemic inflammation models supporting its use.

In assays using hypoxic proximal tubular cells, one would therefore predict reduced markers of pyroptosis, improved cell viability, and a lower expression of fibrogenic proteins such as TGF-β and α-SMA.  \nThere is also supportive evidence that NLRP3 is expressed in proximal tubular cells and that its activation is directly linked to inflammatory responses and fibrosis under hypoxic conditions (Ochoa et al., 2023; Komada & Muruve, 2019). The selective inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E should thus translate into improved cellular integrity and a mitigated progression of the inflammatory milieu that typifies CKD. This expected modulation of pyroptosis and fibrosis markers provides a clear biochemical rationale for using INF4E as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic therapeutic candidate in kidney disease models.  \n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe analysis of INF4E as a repurposed drug candidate for chronic kidney disease presents both promising and challenging aspects. One major strength of INF4E lies in its clearly defined mechanism of action; by targeting the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and interfering with ATP hydrolysis, INF4E offers a direct method to abrogate inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. This is particularly relevant in CKD, where hypoxia-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in proximal tubular cells is a key pathological event leading to pyroptosis, inflammation, and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019).  \nAnother strength is its proven submicromolar potency as demonstrated in phenotypic screens, along with a degree of oral bioavailability in rodent models that supports the feasibility of future in vivo investigations (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021). This potency, combined with its specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome, positions INF4E as a candidate with the potential to modulate inflammatory responses without broadly suppressing the entire immune system. Moreover, by specifically reducing IL-18 release, INF4E may offer advantages over broader anti-inflammatory approaches that risk impairing normal host defense mechanisms (Thomas et al., 2022).  \nA potential weakness, however, is the risk associated with irreversible covalent binding, which, while conferring prolonged effects, may also lead to off-target toxicity if the selectivity is not absolute. Some acrylate derivatives have been noted for cytotoxicity issues, and although chemical optimization—such as the development of related compounds like INF39—has been undertaken to alleviate these concerns, it remains a critical point for evaluation in renal cells that are already susceptible to injury under hypoxic conditions (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \nFurthermore, while the mechanistic rationale for targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in CKD is strong, the clinical translation of NLRP3 inhibitors has been slow. Currently, only limited clinical trial data are available for NLRP3 inhibitors in CKD, and the majority of evidence remains at the preclinical level (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023).  \nAnother consideration is that chronic kidney disease is a multifactorial condition wherein inflammasome activation is just one of several pathogenic processes, including metabolic dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and oxidative stress. Therefore, while INF4E may effectively block one critical pathway—namely, hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation—it might need to be combined with therapies targeting other aspects of CKD pathogenesis to achieve a comprehensive therapeutic effect (Unknown Reference; Mulay, 2019).  \nDespite these challenges, INF4E’s selectivity for a mechanistically validated target, its oral availability, and its demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory models provide a strong rationale for further investigation. In assays designed to model hypoxic tubular injury, INF4E is expected to reduce pyroptosis and fibrogenic signaling, thereby slowing CKD progression. The drug’s success in other inflammatory contexts, such as sepsis models, lends additional weight to its potential, although caution must be exercised when extrapolating these data to the complex microenvironment of the kidney (Blevins et al., 2022; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \n\nContinued research should focus on dosing optimization, safety profiling in kidney-specific models, and investigation of combination strategies that target both inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in CKD (Komada & Muruve, 2019; Mulay, 2019; Pagliaro & Penna, 2023; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nOverall, INF4E represents a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for chronic kidney disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, which aligns well with an established pathogenic pathway in CKD—namely, hypoxia-driven NLRP3 inflammasome activation in proximal tubular cells. Its ability to block the ATPase activity of NLRP3, thereby preventing both caspase-1 activation and IL-18 release, underpins a novel strategy aimed at mitigating pyroptosis and subsequent fibrogenic signaling cascades. While challenges such as potential off-target cytotoxicity, the need for extensive in vivo validation in CKD models, and integration into a multifactorial therapeutic approach remain, the compelling preclinical data for related compounds and the rigorous mechanistic underpinnings provide a strong basis for advancing INF4E in further preclinical studies and eventual clinical trials. Continued research should include detailed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological evaluations in renal models, as well as assessments of its efficacy in reducing markers of inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrosis in hypoxic proximal tubular cells. Given the complexity of CKD, INF4E may ultimately be best suited for combination therapy alongside agents addressing complementary pathogenic mechanisms. Overall, the potential strengths of INF4E—rooted in its selective, irreversible inhibition of a well‐validated molecular target—are balanced by the need for careful evaluation of safety and clinical translatability in the setting of chronic kidney disease (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nReferences:  \nBlevins, H.

As a kaurane-type diterpenoid, its structure comprises four isoprene units arranged into a characteristic tetracyclic skeleton, which is emblematic of this class of natural products. The compound’s discovery and development emerged from the long-standing tradition of using Rabdosia rubescens (also known as Donglingcao) in Asian folk medicine, where it was historically applied for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In the broader context of drug development, diterpenoids such as oridonin have been recognized for their “drug-like” properties; they have provided scaffolds for synthetic modifications aimed at improving potency, solubility, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Moreover, the extraction and study of oridonin reflect an important paradigm in natural products research, wherein historical use is validated and expanded upon with modern medicinal chemistry techniques. This compound, commercially available from suppliers like Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #O2015), fits well within the class of small-molecule natural products that have been repurposed for modern therapeutic applications in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases (Ding et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOridonin’s use spans a broad spectrum of therapeutic applications. Traditionally, the herbal preparations containing oridonin were employed in Chinese medicine to alleviate conditions ranging from pharyngitis and gingivitis to various inflammatory and tumorous conditions. With the advent of modern biochemical and pharmacological research, oridonin has been extensively studied for its anticancer efficacy; many preclinical studies have demonstrated its capacity to induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and suppress metastasis in a variety of cancer cell lines (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In addition to its anticancer properties, several studies have documented oridonin’s robust anti-inflammatory actions. Notably, oridonin has shown efficacy in experimental models of colitis and gout through its inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that mediates the maturation of IL-1β and is a critical driver of inflammatory responses (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020). Although most of the historical and ongoing research has emphasized oridonin’s anticancer and acute inflammatory indications, there is emerging interest in its potential role in renal pathologies. A search on ClinicalTrials.gov using terms such as “Oridonin AND kidney OR renal OR chronic kidney disease OR glomerulonephritis OR proteinuria OR glomerular” returned tens of thousands of trials, indicating significant research activity into natural products and potentially repurposed compounds for kidney diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, to date there is limited direct clinical evidence of oridonin being deployed specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preclinical studies, particularly those involving rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and ischemia–reperfusion injury, have demonstrated renoprotective effects such as reduced inflammatory cytokine levels, diminished fibrosis markers, and improved renal function parameters; these effects suggest that oridonin or its derivatives might be promising candidates for treating CKD or similar renal conditions (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, oridonin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects primarily through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex known to activate caspase-1 and mediate the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. Recent mechanistic studies have shown that oridonin covalently binds to cysteine 279 within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, a critical residue required for the ATPase activity of NLRP3 and its subsequent oligomerization (He et al., 2018). This binding effectively prevents the conformational changes necessary for the recruitment of NEK7, thereby halting inflammasome assembly and activation. In macrophages, this inhibition leads to a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and attenuates inflammatory cell recruitment—a mechanism that has been validated through pull‐down assays and mass spectrometry, which demonstrated nanomolar potency of oridonin in suppressing NLRP3 activation (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020).\n\nBeyond its direct interaction with the NLRP3 inflammasome, oridonin has been shown to modulate additional signaling pathways. For example, it can inhibit NF-κB and p38-MAPK activation, further blunting the inflammatory response, and it has been implicated in the activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidative defenses at lower concentrations, contributing to its cytoprotective effects (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019). These multifaceted actions underscore the polypharmacological nature of oridonin: while its primary mode of action appears to involve covalent modification of NLRP3, its downstream effects extend into a broader anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative network. This convergence on inflammatory signaling pathways is particularly relevant because overactivation of the inflammasome and subsequent pyroptotic cell death are implicated not only in acute inflammatory diseases but also in chronic fibrotic processes within the kidney (Ding et al., 2020).\n\nExpanding the context to renal pathology, the hypothesis driving our proposal is that human podocytes—which are essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier—express components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of NLRP3 in these cells has been linked to pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, which in turn contributes to podocyte loss, proteinuria, and interstitial fibrosis, all hallmarks of CKD. Although most direct evidence of oridonin’s NLRP3 inhibition comes from studies in immune cells like macrophages (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2016), the underlying mechanism is conserved across cell types. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that oridonin could similarly inhibit NLRP3 activation in podocytes, thereby preventing inflammasome assembly, blocking caspase-1 activation, and ultimately reducing the release of IL-1β (Li et al., 2021). By precluding these downstream events, oridonin may attenuate the cycle of inflammatory damage and fibrosis that underpins progressive renal injury in CKD (Li et al., 2021).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the proposed assays and eventual in vivo models of chronic kidney disease, the expected effect of oridonin centers on its ability to protect podocytes from NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated injury. More specifically, by covalently binding to cysteine 279 in NLRP3, oridonin is anticipated to inhibit ATP hydrolysis and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex. This mechanistic blockade should result in a reduction of caspase-1 activation—a key step in the maturation of IL-1β—and thereby diminish the secretion of this potent pro-inflammatory cytokine (He et al., 2018). In podocytes, such suppression is expected to reduce pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death that directly compromises the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and leads to proteinuria. Preservation of podocyte viability would, in turn, help maintain glomerular barrier integrity, minimizing the leakage of plasma proteins into the urine and limiting the ensuing fibrotic response in the renal interstitium (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nMoreover, the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB and p38-MAPK signaling pathways could provide additional benefits by reducing overall renal inflammation. In animal models of kidney injury—such as those induced by ischemia–reperfusion or diabetic nephropathy—treatment with compounds that inhibit these pathways has been correlated with improved renal function parameters (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021). Therefore, beyond its direct effect on podocyte inflammasome activity, oridonin may exert broader renoprotective actions by dampening inflammatory cascades that contribute to interstitial fibrosis and progressive renal insufficiency. In this context, oridonin’s oral bioavailability and established history in traditional medicine support the feasibility of translating these preclinical findings into clinical benefit for CKD patients (Su et al., 2024).\n\nIt is important to note that while direct evidence of oridonin’s effects on human podocytes remains to be fully elucidated, the expression of NLRP3 in podocytes has been demonstrated in experimental models of CKD. Additionally, studies involving natural products that inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome—such as fucoidan in diabetic kidney disease—have provided supportive mechanistic insights, suggesting that the targeting of inflammasome activation in podocytes is a viable therapeutic strategy (Wang et al., 2022).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nOverall, oridonin emerges as a compelling therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease, given its well-documented mechanism of inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome and its extensive background in modulating inflammatory pathways. Its natural origin and historical use in traditional Chinese medicine provide a robust basis for its safety profile, and preclinical studies have demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, including models of colitis, gout, and even acute kidney injury (Ding et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2021). Strengths of oridonin include its specificity for NLRP3 via covalent binding to a critical cysteine residue, which has been shown to yield nanomolar potency in relevant assays (He et al., 2018). Additionally, oridonin’s ability to modulate secondary pathways (NF-κB, p38-MAPK, and Nrf2) may amplify its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective benefits, addressing multiple facets of CKD pathophysiology ranging from podocyte loss to interstitial fibrosis (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nHowever, several weaknesses must also be considered. Despite promising preclinical data in other disease models, direct evidence for oridonin’s efficacy in modulating NLRP3 activation specifically in podocytes remains limited. Most mechanistic studies have been conducted in macrophages or other cell types, and while the extrapolation is reasonable given the conserved nature of inflammasome signaling, dedicated studies using human podocytes are needed to substantiate the proposed protective effects on proteinuria and interstitial fibrosis (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Furthermore, issues such as moderate potency, limited solubility, and variable bioavailability have been noted with oridonin, necessitating further formulation and structural optimization to ensure therapeutic efficacy in a clinical setting (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). These pharmacokinetic considerations are particularly critical for a chronic indication like CKD, where long-term dosing and sustained target engagement are required.\n\nAnother consideration is the translation of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects observed in acute injury models or non-renal tissue into the context of chronic kidney disease, which involves complex and multifactorial pathophysiology. Although the suppression of inflammasome-driven pyroptosis is a promising target for preventing podocyte injury, CKD progression involves additional factors such as hemodynamic stress, metabolic derangements, and immune dysregulation that may not be fully addressed by NLRP3 inhibition alone (Huang et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2020). Consequently, while the mechanistic specificity of oridonin is appealing, its efficacy in a multifaceted chronic disease state like CKD requires rigorous preclinical validation followed by carefully designed clinical trials.\n\nIn summary, oridonin holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease based on its robust anti-inflammatory mechanism, particularly its ability to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome via covalent binding to cysteine 279. The compound’s multifaceted mechanism—encompassing inhibition of caspase-1 activation, IL-1β maturation, and subsequent pyroptosis—could translate into preservation of podocyte integrity, reduction in proteinuria, and attenuation of interstitial fibrosis, all of which are critical endpoints in CKD management (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Nonetheless, challenges related to drug solubility, bioavailability, and the direct demonstration of efficacy in podocytes must be addressed. Given its strong preclinical validation in other inflammatory conditions, further targeted studies focusing on its renal effects and optimization of drug-like properties are warranted before it can be advanced as a viable treatment for CKD (Tan et al., 2021; Su et al., 2024). Overall, while there is a clear mechanistic rationale supporting the therapeutic potential of oridonin in CKD, additional studies specifically assessing its effects in relevant renal cell types and chronic disease models will be critical to fully validate its clinical utility.\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

"(OLT1177, 8)","(Tranilast, 3)","Both Tranilast (ID 3) and OLT1177 (Dapansutrile; ID 8) target NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated inflammation, a key driver of CKD progression. Tranilast additionally inhibits TGF-β and PDGF signaling, offering a dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic mechanism. It benefits from decades of clinical use for allergic indications and robust preclinical data in diabetic nephropathy and UUO models showing reduced proteinuria and fibrosis. However, direct clinical trials in CKD are lacking, and key molecular interactions (e.g., precise binding to NLRP3 LRR and effects on NEK7) require further structural validation. OLT1177 is a highly selective NACHT-domain inhibitor of NLRP3, has progressed through Phase I and Phase IIa trials in gout and heart failure with excellent safety and oral bioavailability, and shows efficacy in preclinical renal inflammation and diabetic nephropathy models (reduced IL-1β/IL-18, macrophage infiltration, fibrosis). Its mechanism is well defined, sparing other inflammasomes and minimizing broad immunosuppression. Both proposals outline feasible oral dosing and relevant CKD models, but OLT1177’s clinical safety data, target specificity, and translational readiness outweigh Tranilast’s broader but less clinically validated anti-fibrotic rationale.","OLT1177 is selected as the superior candidate because it combines precise, well-validated targeting of the NLRP3 inflammasome with extensive Phase I/IIa safety and pharmacodynamic data in humans. Its mechanism of binding to the NACHT domain ensures high specificity and reduced off-target immunosuppression, and its preclinical efficacy in renal inflammation models directly supports CKD translation. While Tranilast’s dual inhibition of inflammasome and TGF-β is attractive, it lacks direct CKD clinical data, its molecular interactions need further confirmation, and its repurposing pathway may face higher regulatory and mechanistic uncertainties.",12,"(3, 8)","{'hypothesis': 'Tranilast (MedChemExpress, catalog #HY-50819)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Tranilast (MedChemExpress, catalog #HY-50819)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nTranilast, commercially available from MedChemExpress (catalog #HY-50819), is a small-molecule synthetic compound originally developed as an anti-allergic agent. Chemically, it is an anthranilic acid derivative, specifically N-[3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl]-anthranilic acid, synthesized initially to treat allergic conditions such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and cutaneous disorders, including keloids and hypertrophic scars (Gilbert et al., 2012). The compound belongs to a class of agents that modulate inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways. The early synthesis of tranilast involved modifying the cinnamoyl anthranilate moiety to enhance potency against pro-fibrotic mediators like transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) while maintaining an acceptable toxicity profile. Over time, the compound’s anti-allergic properties were expanded by preclinical findings that demonstrated its potential to inhibit fibrotic changes via modulation of cytokine signaling and cellular proliferation pathways. This class of anthranilic acid derivatives has been used both in dermatologic and immunologic contexts, providing a background of clinical utility and safety that benefits the repurposing efforts for conditions such as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nTranilast has a well-documented history in clinical settings as an anti-allergic drug since its introduction in Japan decades ago. Its traditional indications have included treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and prevention of keloid formation. More recently, emerging preclinical studies have evaluated tranilast for its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in multiple organ systems. Notably, in experimental animal models of renal disease, tranilast has been investigated in contexts such as diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In these models, tranilast demonstrated the ability to reduce proteinuria, improve kidney structural integrity, and diminish collagen deposition (Gilbert et al., 2012). For instance, in diabetic nephropathy studies, tranilast reduced albuminuria and slowed the decline in glomerular filtration rate through attenuation of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix accumulation. Additionally, human studies in early-stage CKD patients, particularly those with diabetic nephropathy, receiving tranilast combined with standard therapies such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs have shown reductions in urinary markers like collagen type IV and albumin excretion (Gilbert et al., 2012). Beyond renal applications, the compound’s repurposing has been explored in cardiovascular contexts and even in certain inflammatory conditions driven by aberrant inflammasome activation, suggesting a versatility that supports further investigation into its utility against CKD. However, review of ClinicalTrials.gov did not reveal any registered trials directly assessing tranilast in CKD or related renal fibrosis, indicating that while preclinical and limited clinical observations are encouraging, robust clinical evaluation in CKD remains to be undertaken (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe hypothesized mechanism for tranilast in CKD centers on its ability to inhibit key inflammatory and fibrotic processes via direct intervention in inflammasome biology. Tranilast’s molecular target is the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex that plays a pivotal role in innate inflammatory responses. The assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires a coordinated interaction among NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and the serine/threonine kinase NEK7. Activation of this complex ultimately leads to the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form, which subsequently processes pro-IL-1β into IL-1β, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that drives pyroptosis and contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Specifically, tranilast is proposed to disrupt the critical interactions between NLRP3 and ASC as well as between NLRP3 and NEK7. This disruption is believed to occur via direct binding to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3, which is essential for its oligomerization and subsequent recruitment of ASC. By preventing ASC oligomerization, tranilast effectively halts the assembly of the inflammasome, thereby blocking caspase-1 activation and reducing IL-1β secretion (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).\n\nIn addition to inflammasome disruption, tranilast has been shown to attenuate TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling—another major contributor to kidney disease progression. TGF-β is well documented as a central mediator of extracellular matrix synthesis and fibroblast activation, and its overexpression in chronic kidney injury drives interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. Tranilast’s inhibition of TGF-β signaling includes the suppression of Smad2 phosphorylation and downstream fibrotic responses, leading to reductions in collagen deposition and interstitial matrix accumulation (Gilbert et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2019). Furthermore, tranilast’s capacity to inhibit PDGF signaling reduces mesangial cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in the renal glomerulus, providing an additional mechanistic avenue through which it exerts its renoprotective effects (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the proposed mechanism, the expected effect of tranilast in a CKD context is to attenuate tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis by mitigating both inflammatory and fibrotic signaling. In tubular epithelial cells (TECs), oxidative stress triggers activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in IL-1β secretion and pyroptotic cell death—a process that not only damages the epithelial barrier but also leads to further recruitment of inflammatory cells. By interfering with the NLRP3–ASC and NLRP3–NEK7 interactions, tranilast is anticipated to reduce caspase-1 activation. Consequently, a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis is expected, which would alleviate tubular inflammation under conditions of oxidative stress (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).\n\nFurthermore, the reduction in IL-1β and subsequent dampening of the inflammatory cascade should also lead to a decrease in TGF-β release. TGF-β is critically involved in driving fibroblast activation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. Thus, by curtailing the initial inflammasome-mediated inflammatory trigger, tranilast indirectly reduces TGF-β levels, thereby preventing its downstream pro-fibrotic effects. This is particularly relevant in diabetic nephropathy and UUO models, where TGF-β-mediated fibrosis is a major determinant of disease progression (Chen et al., 2020; Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nIn summary, the expected outcome in an in vitro or in vivo CKD assay would be a demonstrable decrease in markers of inflammation (such as IL-1β levels), reduced caspase-1 activity, diminished pyroptosis (as measured by LDH release or similar assays), and lowered expression of fibrotic markers including collagen, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Moreover, the preservation of tubular epithelial cell integrity and a consequent improvement in overall kidney function would provide functional support for tranilast’s therapeutic efficacy in CKD (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nTranilast represents a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease based on its dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. From a mechanistic standpoint, its ability to selectively disrupt the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting key protein–protein interactions (specifically between NLRP3, ASC, and NEK7) underpins its potential to reduce caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. This targeted mechanism is particularly attractive because it distinguishes tranilast from broader-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs that may have off-target effects. Moreover, by concurrently attenuating TGF-β signaling pathways, tranilast can reduce fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition—both critical contributors to the progression of CKD (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019).\n\nA major strength of tranilast is its established clinical use as an anti-allergic agent over several decades, which provides a substantial record of safety and tolerability in humans. Its oral dosing regimen further facilitates rapid clinical repurposing for CKD. Preclinical studies in animal models of diabetic nephropathy and UUO have demonstrated measurable benefits, such as reduced proteinuria and improved renal histology, lending support to its potential efficacy in human CKD (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nHowever, there are certain weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Despite promising preclinical data, there is a noted absence of registered clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with tranilast (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), which indicates that further clinical validation is required. Moreover, while tranilast’s inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is supported by various mechanistic studies, the precise molecular details—such as confirmation of binding to the LRR domain of NLRP3 and the exact nature of its impact on NEK7 interactions—require further elucidation through biochemical and structural studies (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). In addition, as with any repurposed drug, careful evaluation of potential off-target immunomodulatory effects is necessary. There have been reports of immune-mediated adverse events in other clinical indications, which, although not prominent, must be monitored during chronic administration in CKD patients (Strilchuk et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, the body of preclinical literature strongly supports the hypothesis that tranilast can disrupt NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and attenuate subsequent inflammatory and fibrotic cascades in the kidney. Given its dual mechanism—inhibiting both inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion and TGF-β–mediated fibrosis—tranilast emerges as an attractive candidate for repurposing in CKD. Its established use in other indications and favorable oral bioavailability further underscore its potential for rapid clinical translation. Nonetheless, the lack of direct clinical trial evidence in renal disease and the need for further mechanistic clarification represent critical challenges that the research team must address in subsequent studies (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023). Overall, the strengths of mechanistic specificity and a well-established safety profile position tranilast as a promising drug candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease, warranting further investigation through comprehensive preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials.\n\nReferences  \nChen, S., Wang, Y., Pan, Y., Liu, Y., Zheng, S., Ding, K., Mu, K., Yuan, Y., Li, Z., Song, H., Jin, Y., & Fu, J.

The compound was synthesized via a chemically directed approach—in particular, its synthesis involved an alkylation reaction of sodium methanesulfinate with 3-bromopropionitrile, yielding a β-sulfonyl nitrile moiety that confers its inhibitory activity (Marchetti et al., 2018). This class of small molecule inhibitors has been widely explored for targeting inflammatory pathways through modulation of innate immune responses. Historically, β-sulfonyl nitrile compounds have attracted attention as therapeutic agents due to their capacity to engage key protein domains involved in inflammation while maintaining selectivity and oral bioavailability, attributes that are critical for chronic treatment regimens (Marchetti et al., 2018).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOLT1177 has progressed through several stages of development and clinical evaluation in diseases characterized by uncontrolled inflammation, notably in acute gout flares, heart failure, and conditions linked to cytokine release syndromes. In Phase I clinical trials, dapansutrile demonstrated an excellent safety profile when administered to healthy subjects at dosages up to 1000 mg per day for 8 days, thereby establishing its tolerability and preliminary evidence of target engagement (Jansen et al., 2019). Moreover, therapeutic evaluations in inflammatory settings—such as a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study in patients with NYHA II–III systolic heart failure—further underscored its favorable safety profile and pharmacodynamic effects despite the fact that current clinical investigations have not directly targeted Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) populations (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical studies in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy have demonstrated that treatment with OLT1177 leads to significant reductions in renal IL-1β levels, decreased macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis, suggesting that its benefits extend to kidney-related inflammatory damage (Mulay, 2019). Although clinical trials specifically focused on CKD or renal inflammation are lacking at this point, the robust anti-inflammatory effects observed in related models and conditions provide a sound rationale for repurposing OLT1177 in chronic kidney disease.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, OLT1177 selectively inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by targeting its central NACHT domain, where it interferes with ATPase activity that is critical for the oligomerization process necessary for inflammasome assembly. Under normal conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggers the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), leading to the formation of a multi-protein complex that activates caspase-1 and drives the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) (Kim et al., 2019). OLT1177 binds specifically to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, thereby blocking the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC, which is a necessary event for full inflammasome assembly (Marchetti et al., 2018). In doing so, it prevents the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-1 and effectively reduces the secretion of IL-1β. This mechanism is particularly significant in environments of hyperglycemic stress, where increased NLRP3 activity in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) drives inflammation, pyroptotic cell death, and subsequent tubulointerstitial fibrosis (Mulay, 2019). Additionally, by curtailing downstream cytokine release and pyroptosis, OLT1177 is believed to mitigate the metabolic cost of inflammation, an effect that has been observed in multiple preclinical in vivo studies in conditions ranging from acute arthritis to cardiac dysfunction (Jansen et al., 2019; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe central hypothesis is that through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, OLT1177 will effectively block the recruitment of ASC and disrupt subsequent caspase-1 activation in renal tubular cells, particularly under conditions of hyperglycemia which are common in diabetic nephropathy. Under hyperglycemic stress, renal tubular epithelial cells exhibit increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and aberrant inflammasome activation resulting in heightened secretion of IL-1β, a cytokine implicated in promoting fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition. By preventing the cleavage of pro-IL-1β into its active form, OLT1177 is expected to prevent pyroptotic cell death of TECs and interrupt the deleterious cycle of inflammation-driven fibrogenesis in the kidney (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Evidence from animal models indicates that selective blockade of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to a marked decrease in renal inflammation as evidenced by reduced macrophage infiltration and lower profibrotic cytokine levels, which supports the expectation that OLT1177 could yield appreciable renoprotective outcomes in CKD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In the proposed assay, it is anticipated that OLT1177 will reduce markers of inflammation such as IL-1β and IL-18 in the culture medium of hyperglycemia-stressed TECs, thereby correlating with decreased pyroptosis and improved cell viability. This would be further corroborated by downstream effects such as reduced activation of profibrotic pathways, including lower TGF-β signaling and diminished deposition of fibrotic markers, ultimately mitigating the progression toward renal fibrosis (Cliff, 2023; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate with substantial potential for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease owing to its well-characterized mechanism of action, favorable preclinical results, and established safety profile in early clinical studies. One of the major strengths of OLT1177 lies in its selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an attractive target given the critical role of NLRP3 in mediating renal inflammation, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenesis. Its synthetic origins and robust medicinal chemistry underpin its precise targeting of the NACHT domain in NLRP3, effectively sparing other inflammasomes and reducing the risk of broad immunosuppression (Marchetti et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Furthermore, its oral bioavailability and metabolic stability make it suitable for chronic administration, an essential consideration for CKD where long-term therapy is required (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nFrom a therapeutic history perspective, although OLT1177 has not yet been directly tested in human CKD patient populations, its successful progression through Phase I trials for conditions such as gout and heart failure, combined with promising data in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy, strongly supports its potential utility in renal settings (Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Preclinical studies show reduced renal IL-1β secretion, diminished macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis when NLRP3 is inhibited by agents like OLT1177, lending biological credence to the hypothesis that inflammasome inhibition could slow CKD progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nAt the molecular level, the precise action of OLT1177—binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ASC recruitment—represents a highly targeted approach that contrasts with cytokine-neutralizing therapies such as anti-IL-1β antibodies. This specificity is advantageous because it not only prevents the generation of IL-1β but also curtails the activation of NFκB and other downstream inflammatory cascades, potentially reducing off-target effects and preserving broader immune competence (Marchetti et al., 2018; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020). Additionally, the expected anti-inflammatory effects in renal tubular cells—specifically preventing pyroptosis and fibrogenesis—are consistent with literature demonstrating that NLRP3 is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells under hyperglycemic and inflammatory stress (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain. One of the limitations stems from the current lack of direct clinical evidence in CKD populations; while animal models provide a strong rationale, the translation of these findings into human CKD may be complicated by the multifactorial nature of the disease, where multiple pathways contribute to renal injury beyond inflammasome activation. Additionally, the chronic nature of CKD necessitates prolonged administration of therapeutic agents, and long-term safety data for OLT1177 in such a setting are still pending. There is also the possibility that inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome might impair necessary innate immune responses, although the specificity of OLT1177 for the NLRP3 complex—in contrast to more generalized anti-inflammatory agents—should, in theory, mitigate this concern (Seok et al., 2021).\n\nMoreover, while the preclinical data in models of diabetic nephropathy and crystal-induced kidney injury are promising, variability in genetic and environmental factors in human CKD could affect the compound’s efficacy. It will therefore be critical to design dedicated clinical trials in defined CKD populations, ideally incorporating biomarkers of inflammasome activity, such as circulating IL-1β and IL-18 levels, as well as imaging and functional assessments of renal fibrosis and function. The anti-fibrotic effects, in particular, warrant closer mechanistic studies to confirm that inhibition of TEC pyroptosis and preservation of tubular integrity occur in the human kidney as they do in animal models (Williams et al., 2022; Cliff, 2023).\n\nIn conclusion, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) represents a compelling candidate for repurposing in Chronic Kidney Disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, favorable pharmacological profile, and preclinical evidence supporting its renoprotective effects. Its ability to directly inhibit the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding to the NACHT domain and blocking ASC recruitment addresses a critical upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that leads to caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and subsequent pyroptosis of renal tubular cells. This mode of action has the potential to attenuate the inflammation-driven fibrogenesis that is central to CKD progression, particularly in diabetic nephropathy where hyperglycemic stress is a key driver of renal injury.\n\nStrengths of OLT1177 include its synthetic origin allowing for structural optimization, its demonstrated safety in Phase I clinical trials, its oral bioavailability which is advantageous for chronic therapy, and its selective inhibitory action that minimizes off-target effects. Additionally, existing preclinical studies showing reduced renal IL-1β, diminished macrophage infiltration, and lowered fibrotic responses in models of nephropathy provide a promising foundation for further exploration in CKD (Mulay, 2019; Jansen et al., 2019).\n\nWeaknesses or challenges include the current absence of dedicated clinical trials in CKD, the complexity of CKD pathophysiology where multiple inflammatory and fibrotic pathways are involved, and the potential risk that chronic inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome could in some contexts compromise the host defense or alter essential cellular processes. These concerns underscore the need for carefully designed preclinical studies specifically in renal disease models, followed by early phase clinical trials in well-defined CKD populations to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and long-term safety.\n\nOverall, based on the comprehensive literature review, the mechanistic rationale, and the encouraging preclinical and early clinical data available, OLT1177 shows significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease. The next steps should involve further detailed studies in CKD-specific preclinical models that assess not only inflammatory cytokine modulation but also functional outcomes such as glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria reduction, and fibrosis attenuation. A robust clinical development program targeting patients with diabetic nephropathy and other forms of CKD characterized by inflammasome activation would be the logical progression to validate its clinical utility (Marchetti et al., 2018; Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nReferences  \nCliff, C.

"(CY-09, 7)","(A-438079, 2)","Both candidates target inflammasome-driven inflammation in CKD, but their evidence, mechanism, and translatability diverge. Candidate 1 (A-438079) is a potent, selective P2X7 receptor antagonist with robust preclinical data in acute renal injury (cisplatin nephrotoxicity, ischemia-reperfusion, sepsis models) demonstrating reduced IL-1β release, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Its MoA is clear: competitive inhibition of ATP binding to P2X7 prevents K+ efflux and NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Pharmacokinetics show good bioavailability and minimal off-target effects. However, direct CKD‐specific data are sparse, and P2X7 knockout studies in hypertensive or chronic models have yielded mixed protection, suggesting context-dependent efficacy and potential compensatory pathways. Clinical P2X7 antagonists have had limited success in chronic inflammatory diseases._candidate 2 (CY-09) is a small‐molecule thiazolidinone that directly binds the Walker A ATP-binding motif of NLRP3, blocking oligomerization, ASC speck formation, caspase-1 activation, IL-1β/IL-18 release, and pyroptosis. MoA specificity is exceptionally high, with no effects on NF-κB or other PRRs. Preclinical evidence for CY-09 shows potent nanomolar inhibition of NLRP3 in macrophages and efficacy in rodent models of sepsis, colitis, and metabolic inflammation. While CY-09 itself lacks published CKD studies, extensive literature on NLRP3 genetic knockout and related inhibitors (e.g., MCC950) demonstrates clear renoprotection in diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, cisplatin‐induced fibrosis, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Oral bioavailability and favorable rodent safety further support its translational potential. Key uncertainties include the need for direct CKD model validation of CY-09, off-target profiling against other ATPases, and assessment of long-term safety in chronic dosing. In contrast, A-438079’s target (P2X7) is one step upstream of NLRP3, potentially allowing alternative inflammasome activators to bypass blockade, and its CKD relevance is less established.","CY-09 demonstrates a more direct, specific mechanism of action on the central NLRP3 inflammasome, a validated driver of CKD inflammation and fibrosis, whereas A-438079 acts upstream at P2X7, where context-dependent compensatory pathways may limit efficacy in chronic settings. The wealth of genetic NLRP3 KO and MCC950 data in diverse CKD models outweighs the acute injury evidence for A-438079. Furthermore, CY-09’s molecular specificity, oral bioavailability, and safety in rodents provide a stronger translational foundation for chronic administration. Although CY-09 requires direct CKD model validation, its target biology is more central to CKD pathogenesis and backed by a larger body of disease‐relevant evidence than P2X7 antagonism.",13,"(2, 7)","{'hypothesis': 'A-438079 (Tocris, catalog #2947)', 'answer': 'Proposal for A-438079 (Tocris, catalog #2947)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nA-438079 is a synthetic small‐molecule antagonist originally developed as a selective inhibitor of the P2X7 receptor, a ligand‐gated ion channel known to be activated by high concentrations of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The compound belongs to a class of agents that includes disubstituted tetrazoles and cyanoguanidine derivatives, which have been characterized by their ability to selectively block P2X7 receptor activation without significantly affecting other P2X subtypes. Its design and synthesis were initially achieved by pharmaceutical research groups (notably Abbott Laboratories as indicated in early publications) and have since been commercialized by companies such as Tocris (catalog #2947). This class of compounds was originally optimized for studies in inflammatory processes and pain models, as they inhibit ATP‐induced ion flux such as calcium influx and potassium efflux, a key factor in the activation cascade of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nBiochemically and pharmacologically, A-438079 has been investigated in various preclinical models for its ability to mitigate inflammation. It has demonstrated efficacy in rodent models of neuropathic pain and inflammatory conditions by inhibiting P2X7-mediated IL-1β release. In terms of renal applications, there is evidence from several studies that selective P2X7 antagonism can protect against kidney insults such as ischemia-reperfusion injury and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. For example, Zhang et al. (2014) showed that blocking P2X7 with antagonists like A-438079 attenuated cisplatin-induced renal tubular damage by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis markers in mice (Zhang et al., 2014). Additionally, studies such as those by Arulkumaran (2016) and colleagues have demonstrated that while genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of P2X7 in some models does not always equate to improved renal function, the block of P2X7-related signaling reduces inflammasome activation and cytokine release in immune cells and tubular epithelium (Arulkumaran, 2016; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Even though A-438079 has not been widely tested clinically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), its pharmacological profile as a P2X7 antagonist has been well characterized in biochemical studies and preclinical kidney injury models. This builds an indirect but strong rationale for repurposing it in CKD contexts, where sustained inflammation and fibrosis are major pathogenic drivers (Birch et al., 2013; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe primary mechanism of A-438079 is its high-affinity, selective antagonism of the P2X7 receptor. The P2X7 receptor is unique among the P2X family in its requirement for high concentrations of ATP, which are typically achieved in pathological conditions involving cell injury and inflammation. Under normal conditions, extracellular ATP levels are low; however, during tissue damage, ATP is released into the extracellular space where it binds to and activates P2X7 receptors expressed on immune cells (especially macrophages) and renal tubular epithelial cells (Han et al., 2020; Howarth, 2020).  \n\nUpon binding of ATP to the receptor, P2X7 undergoes a conformational change that opens its ion channel, permitting the influx of calcium ions and the efflux of potassium ions. This potassium efflux is a critical upstream event that triggers the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex responsible for activating caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 then cleaves the precursors of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature, secreted forms. These cytokines play major roles in propagating inflammatory signals, inducing pyroptosis (a form of inflammatory cell death), and promoting fibrotic remodeling in affected tissues (Qian et al., 2021; Shokoples, 2022).\n\nA-438079 interacts with the P2X7 receptor by competitively inhibiting ATP binding, thereby preventing the channel’s conformational change and subsequent ion flux. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) is approximately 40 nM in rodent models, indicating high potency (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). By blocking this pathway, A-438079 inhibits downstream events including NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 cleavage, and the release of IL-1β, ultimately reducing inflammatory responses and preventing the activation of fibrotic signaling pathways in kidney tissue, particularly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells where P2X7 and NLRP3 are highly expressed (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the context of chronic kidney disease, the principal pathological mechanisms include persistent inflammation and fibrosis, processes that are significantly driven by inflammasome activation in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. The hypothesis postulates that A-438079 will block ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor in these cell types. By doing so, it prevents the crucial potassium efflux that is necessary for the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The expected downstream effects include a reduction in caspase-1 activation, decreased cleavage of pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β, and ultimately lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This chain of events is anticipated to reduce pyroptosis and curb the progression of fibrosis within the kidney (Qian et al., 2021; Arulkumaran et al., 2018).\n\nRenal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells are known to express both the P2X7 receptor and NLRP3, as evidenced by various studies outlining their roles in mediating inflammation-driven fibrosis in CKD (Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020). In assays, it is expected that treatment with A-438079 would result in a measurable decrease in IL-1β release, reduced markers of inflammation such as caspase-1 activity, and potentially lower expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components. Furthermore, by blunting chronic inflammatory responses, A-438079 may help to preserve kidney structure and function, thereby slowing the progression of CKD. The compound’s favorable pharmacokinetic properties—particularly its demonstrated bioavailability and minimal off-target effects—support the feasibility of achieving these outcomes (Burnstock, 2017).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nA-438079 presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on several factors. One of its major strengths lies in its selectivity and potency as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, which allows it to precisely target an upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that is centrally implicated in CKD. The ability of A-438079 to block ATP-induced ion flux is particularly compelling because it interrupts the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a known driver of IL-1β and IL-18 release in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells (Arulkumaran, 2016; Qian et al., 2021). This molecular specificity holds promise for reducing inflammation and subsequent fibrotic formation in the kidney, both of which are critical elements in CKD progression.\n\nThe preclinical evidence supporting the use of P2X7 antagonists in models of acute kidney injury, such as cisplatin nephrotoxicity and sepsis-induced renal injury, provides additional rationale, even though such models are not perfect surrogates for CKD (Zhang et al., 2014; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Some studies have demonstrated that selective P2X7 blockade can attenuate inflammatory cytokine production, improve renal function markers, and reduce cell death, thereby supporting the hypothesis that similar benefits could be realized in chronic inflammatory settings like CKD (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nAdditionally, the mechanistic details of P2X7 receptor signaling – requiring high extracellular ATP concentrations, initiating K+ efflux, and triggering inflammasome assembly – align closely with the known processes of renal inflammation and fibrosis. The fact that P2X7 and NLRP3 are co-expressed in key renal cell populations reinforces the logic behind using A-438079 to target these pathways (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and potential challenges that need to be considered. Firstly, in some preclinical models, especially in certain rat strains (as noted by studies involving P2X7 receptor knockout rats), the inhibition or deletion of P2X7 did not significantly alter renal function or prevent kidney injury induced by hypertensive factors such as angiotensin II (Nespoux et al., 2024). This suggests that compensatory pathways may exist, and the role of P2X7 might be context-dependent or vary among species. Secondly, clinical trials of P2X7 antagonists in other inflammatory diseases have had mixed outcomes, raising concerns about translational efficacy in human CKD (Luz et al., 2019). Moreover, while the mechanism of inflammasome inhibition is well understood in vitro, the in vivo pharmacodynamics in the kidney may be complicated by variable local ATP concentrations and the dynamic expression of the receptor in disease states.\n\nFrom a drug development standpoint, the potency (IC50 ~40 nM) and reported good bioavailability of A-438079 are advantageous. Its minimal off-target effects also reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions in clinical translation. However, more robust and specific data in CKD models are necessary to establish whether the attenuation of IL-1β release can consistently translate into meaningful improvements in renal fibrosis and overall kidney function over long-term treatment courses (Chen et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2024).\n\nIn summary, A-438079’s targeted inhibition of the P2X7 receptor offers a novel approach to halt the ATP-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby mitigating a key upstream trigger of inflammatory cascades in CKD. Its preclinical track record in inflammatory and renal injury models, combined with its mechanistic specificity, positions it as a strong candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease. Nonetheless, species variability, redundant inflammatory pathways, and the need for further in vivo validation in models of long-term kidney disease remain potential hurdles. If these challenges are addressed in further preclinical and early clinical studies, A-438079 could represent a significant advance in targeting the inflammation-fibrosis axis in CKD (Arulkumaran et al., 2018; Fantauzzi, 2013; Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe strengths of A-438079 for CKD include its high potency, selectivity, and well-elucidated mechanism of action in blocking ATP-induced P2X7 receptor activation—a critical initiator of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. These molecular interactions have been robustly characterized in multiple preclinical studies, indicating that the drug may effectively reduce IL-1β-mediated inflammation and subsequent fibrotic responses. In models of acute renal injury, antagonizing P2X7 has led to reduced cell death and improved renal function, which supports its potential usage in CKD where chronic inflammation is a driver of progressive fibrosis. Moreover, the chemical class to which A-438079 belongs has been extensively employed in studies of inflammatory diseases, reinforcing the feasibility of this approach (Deplano, 2012; Qian et al., 2021).\n\nConversely, potential weaknesses lie in the heterogeneity of experimental outcomes across different preclinical models and species. Some studies have shown that genetic deletion of P2X7 in rats does not always confer renal protection in induced kidney injury, suggesting that the pathophysiology in certain species—or even specific CKD etiologies—may be driven by redundant pathways beyond P2X7/NLRP3. In addition, although A-438079 demonstrates promising in vitro efficacy, there remains a critical need for long-term in vivo studies specifically in CKD models to verify that its anti-inflammatory effects translate into clinically meaningful outcomes in terms of preservation of renal function and reduction in fibrosis. Lastly, it is important to consider potential compensatory mechanisms in chronic inflammation that may limit the sole efficacy of P2X7 inhibition (Nespoux et al., 2024; Luz et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, A-438079 is a scientifically compelling therapeutic candidate for CKD, with robust mechanistic support and significant preclinical evidence in inflammatory models. Its ability to target the P2X7/NLRP3 axis addresses a novel therapeutic area in CKD by potentially halting the progression of inflammation-driven fibrosis. However, potential limitations due to species-specific responses and redundancy in inflammatory signaling must be carefully evaluated in future studies. Overall, A-438079 merits further investigation as part of a multi-pronged approach to modulate inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in chronic kidney disease (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:  \nArulkumaran, N.

Chemically, CY-09 belongs to the class of thiazolidinone derivatives, a category known for its capacity to interfere with enzymatic activities via covalent or non-covalent interactions. Its development was driven by the need to specifically target the ATP-binding site within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, particularly focusing on the Walker A motif—a conserved nucleotide-binding region that is essential for the ATPase activity required for NLRP3 oligomerization. The design rationale behind CY-09 was based on structure-based drug design principles, where the compound was engineered to directly bind NLRP3, thereby preventing the conformational changes necessary for inflammasome assembly. This chemical class has previously been used in various contexts to modulate protein–enzyme interactions, and its application in inflammasome biology represents an evolution of this approach to target excessive inflammation mediated by the innate immune system (Jiang et al., 2017; Bertinaria et al., 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of CY-09 is rooted in preclinical studies where it has been extensively characterized in vitro and in animal models of inflammatory diseases. Initially, CY-09 demonstrated potent inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in murine bone marrow–derived macrophages stimulated with canonical activators such as ATP, nigericin, and monosodium urate crystals, showing a dose-dependent reduction in IL-1β secretion and caspase-1 activation. Its efficacy has been documented in rodent models of sepsis and colitis, as well as in metabolic disorder models where NLRP3-driven inflammation is a core pathological feature. Although no clinical trials having been completed in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) specifically have been reported to date, the compound’s inclusion in multiple clinical trial searches (ClinicalTrials.gov) indicates that there is active interest in repurposing or further evaluating NLRP3 inhibitors like CY-09 in kidney-related conditions. Furthermore, the extensive body of work demonstrating that NLRP3 knockout or pharmacological inhibition confers protection against renal fibrosis, tubular inflammation, and other hallmarks of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Zhou & Li, 2023) supports the translational potential of a molecule such as CY-09. Historically, similar NLRP3 inhibitors (for example, MCC950) have been applied in various preclinical models of inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and their protective effects in conditions like diabetic nephropathy and ischemia-reperfusion injury provide a strong rationale for applying CY-09 in CKD (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nCY-09 exerts its therapeutic action by directly binding to the NLRP3 protein at its NACHT domain, specifically targeting the Walker A (or P-loop) motif responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis. This binding event competitively inhibits ATP from accessing the site, thereby blocking the ATPase activity essential for NLRP3 oligomerization. Without ATP hydrolysis, NLRP3 is unable to undergo the conformational rearrangements necessary for the aggregation of multiple NLRP3 molecules into the inflammasome complex. Consequently, the formation of the adaptor protein ASC specks is prevented, leading to a blockade of pro-caspase-1 activation and subsequent cleavage into its active form. This chain of events ultimately results in a reduction of the maturation and secretion of the central proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and it halts gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis—a form of lytic, inflammatory cell death that substantially contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis in CKD. Importantly, studies have demonstrated that CY-09 does not interfere with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, underscoring its molecular specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2019). The molecular interaction of CY-09 is supported by biotinylated pull-down assays which confirm its selective binding to NLRP3 over other inflammasome components, and computational docking models corroborate a binding mode that is competitive with ATP at the Walker A motif (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017). This detailed molecular mechanism signifies that CY-09 operates at an early and critical step in the inflammasome pathway, making it a highly attractive candidate for diseases with a significant inflammatory component, such as CKD (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe proposed hypothesis for applying CY-09 to CKD is that by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in human proximal tubular epithelial cells, the compound will inhibit ATPase-driven oligomerization of NLRP3, thereby reducing the formation of ASC specks, the activation of caspase-1, and the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. The downstream effect of blocking these events is the inhibition of gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis, which is known to drive tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrotic remodeling—a central hallmark in the progression of CKD. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, NLRP3 is expressed and activated in response to various stress stimuli, including oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and metabolic dysregulation, all of which are common in CKD pathogenesis. By impeding this pathway, CY-09 is expected to diminish inflammatory cytokine secretion and reduce cell death, thereby preserving tubular integrity, minimizing interstitial inflammation, and preventing the fibrotic changes that culminate in renal function decline (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Data from preclinical models of kidney injury, such as those using MCC950 and other NLRP3 knockout models, have consistently shown improvements in renal structure and function, and reduction in profibrotic markers upon inhibition of the NLRP3 pathway (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017). Furthermore, oral bioavailability and a favorable safety profile in rodent studies enhance the clinical feasibility of CY-09 as a repurposed agent for CKD (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The expected effects in a CKD model would therefore include reduced extracellular matrix deposition, lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the renal interstitium, and overall attenuation of the fibrotic process, translating ultimately into stabilization of renal function (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nBased on the comprehensive literature review, CY-09 emerges as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease. One of its greatest strengths lies in its robust and specific mechanism of action; by directly binding to the Walker A motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3, CY-09 efficiently prevents the initial ATP-driven steps that are critical for inflammasome assembly. This targeted inhibition ensures that downstream activation events—namely ASC speck formation, caspase-1 activation, and subsequent IL-1β/IL-18 maturation—are effectively suppressed. Such specificity is critical for minimizing off-target effects, as CY-09 has shown no significant interference with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, which could reduce undesirable immunosuppressive side effects (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The repurposing strategy is further supported by extensive preclinical evidence indicating that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 results in marked protection against renal fibrosis and inflammation in various CKD models. The preclinical efficacy of similar NLRP3 inhibitors such as MCC950 in models of diabetic nephropathy, cisplatin-induced renal injury, and ischemia-reperfusion injury reinforces the therapeutic potential of targeting NLRP3 in kidney disease (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017).\n\nAnother significant strength of CY-09 is its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile in rodent studies, which is an important consideration for chronic administration required in CKD therapy (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). This pharmacokinetic profile, along with the compound’s high potency in inflammatory assays where nanomolar inhibitory effects have been observed, provides confidence that CY-09 could achieve therapeutically effective concentrations in the kidney without systemic toxicity.\n\nHowever, there are also challenges and uncertainties. Although extensive preclinical studies in inflammatory disease models support the potential of CY-09, direct evidence of its efficacy in chronic kidney disease models specifically remains limited. The majority of studies to date have focused on sepsis, metabolic disorders, and murine colitis rather than on kidney-specific outcomes. There is, therefore, a need for more targeted preclinical research in CKD models—including those mimicking diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and cisplatin-induced renal fibrosis—to definitively establish the renoprotective effects of CY-09 (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Additionally, while the mechanism is well-characterized in immune cells like macrophages, further studies need to elucidate its effects specifically in human proximal tubular epithelial cells and other renal cell types that contribute to CKD progression. Such studies should evaluate not only biochemical markers of inflammasome activation but also functional outcomes like proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate, and histological indices of fibrosis.\n\nAnother potential weakness concerns the translational gap between rodent models and human CKD. The pathophysiology of CKD is multifactorial, and while NLRP3-mediated inflammation is a key driver, the disease process involves many convergent signaling pathways including TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling and oxidative stress pathways. It is possible that the blockade of NLRP3 alone may not be sufficient to fully arrest disease progression in humans. In addition, although CY-09 appears selective based on current evidence, there is always the risk of off-target effects when a compound modulates ATPase activity, given the abundance of ATP-binding proteins in the cell. Careful profiling of CY-09 against a broad spectrum of other ATPases and kinases will be necessary to confirm its selectivity in a clinical setting (Sandall et al., 2020).\n\nIn summary, CY-09 represents an innovative and mechanistically compelling therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease due to its direct inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a central mediator of renal inflammation and fibrosis. Its synthesis as a thiazolidinone derivative and its proven ability to bind the Walker A motif within the NACHT domain underscore its potential to precisely block inflammasome-driven pyroptosis. Preclinical evidence from models of various inflammatory conditions, along with robust biochemical data demonstrating nanomolar potency in macrophage assays, provides a strong rationale for its repurposing in kidney disease. Furthermore, its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety in rodent studies enhance its translational appeal. Nonetheless, additional research is needed to specifically validate its efficacy in CKD models, assess its long-term safety, and determine its pharmacodynamic effects in kidney-specific cell types such as proximal tubular epithelial cells. Overall, the strengths of CY-09’s targeted mechanism, coupled with supportive preclinical efficacy data from related inflammatory models, make it a promising candidate for further development and evaluation in Chronic Kidney Disease (ClinicalTrials.gov; Jiang et al., 2017; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nBertinaria, M., Gastaldi, S., Marini, E., & Giorgis, M.

"(MCC950, 9)","(Brilliant Blue G, 1)","Both candidates target inflammasome–driven inflammation and fibrosis in CKD, but they differ in mechanism specificity, depth of evidence, and translational readiness. Candidate 1 (BBG) is a noncompetitive P2X7 antagonist with broad anti-inflammatory effects demonstrated in UUO and hypertensive nephropathy rodent models. It benefits from an established safety record as a dye in ophthalmic and CNS applications and has favorable solubility and manufacturability. However, its mechanism is upstream and indirect: P2X7 blockade can be bypassed by P2X7-independent inflammasome activation, and the receptor has vascular roles that may complicate systemic use. No direct clinical CKD trials of BBG exist, and redundancy in inflammasome pathways may limit monotherapy efficacy. Candidate 2 (MCC950) is a highly selective diarylsulfonylurea that binds the Walker B motif of NLRP3, directly preventing ATP-driven inflammasome assembly. Extensive preclinical data in multiple CKD‐relevant models—diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, adenine‐induced renal failure—show robust reductions in proteinuria, fibrosis, and improved renal function. Nonhuman primate safety, oral bioavailability, and well‐characterized SAR support translational development. While clinical CKD trials remain scarce, MCC950’s specificity, direct mechanism, and depth of in vivo efficacy provide stronger evidence and a clearer path to human validation.","MCC950 outperforms BBG on several prioritized criteria: it directly and specifically inhibits the central NLRP3 inflammasome rather than modulating an upstream receptor subject to redundancy; it has richer, disease‐relevant in vivo efficacy across multiple CKD models; and it presents a well‐elucidated molecular mechanism with favorable PK and safety in primates. While BBG has an attractive safety profile as a dye and evidence in rodent CKD models, its indirect MoA and lack of clinical CKD data render it less compelling. Therefore, MCC950 (ID 9) is the stronger candidate for further development in CKD.",14,"(1, 9)","{'hypothesis': 'Brilliant Blue G (BBG; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #B0770)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Brilliant Blue G (BBG; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #B0770)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nBrilliant Blue G (BBG) is a synthetic dye originally developed for use in food and as a surgical visualizing agent that has been repurposed as a pharmacological agent. BBG is part of the broad class of blue dyes that have been extensively studied for their ability to interact with the purinergic receptor family, most notably acting as a non‐competitive antagonist of the P2X7 receptor. The compound’s chemical structure confers high water solubility and the ability to be administered at defined doses with a favorable safety profile, as demonstrated by its routine use in ophthalmic surgery and CNS studies without systemic toxicity. In its role as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, BBG has been used in various preclinical studies investigating inflammatory and cell death pathways. Its synthetic origin and established manufacturing process, as offered by suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #B0770), support its scalability for repurposing in chronic diseases. BBG belongs to a class of small molecules that modulate ion channel function, particularly by binding to the ATP‐activated P2X7 receptor, which has been implicated in various inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. This class of compounds has been employed not only for their staining properties but also for their ability to interfere with cellular signaling events related to inflammation, rendering them of considerable interest in conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD) where inflammation and fibrosis are critical pathogenic factors (Ferreira et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nHistorically, Brilliant Blue G has been most widely recognized as a histological staining agent with established safety in both preclinical and clinical contexts, particularly within the neuroprotective field. Its pharmacological actions extend to antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, and preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in animal models of inflammatory diseases, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and various neurodegenerative conditions. More recently, BBG has been evaluated in rodent models of kidney disease. For example, in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) models—a widely used experimental model that mimics tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis—BBG treatment has been observed to reduce inflammation, diminish interstitial fibrosis, and promote tubular cell regeneration (Pereira et al., 2020). In rodent hypertensive nephropathy models, BBG has also been reported to modulate renal vascular resistance and alter tubular injury markers, suggesting that its renoprotective effects might extend to a broader spectrum of CKD–related pathologies. Although clinical trials directly targeting chronic kidney disease with BBG have not yet been detailed in the public literature, searches in ClinicalTrials.gov using terms related to “Brilliant Blue G OR P2X7 antagonist OR P2X7 inhibitor OR NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have identified several ongoing studies investigating similar P2X7 blockade strategies in CKD, which support the translational potential of this approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Prior investigations in animal models of lupus nephritis and hypertensive kidney disease have indicated that BBG’s anti‐inflammatory profile, including decreased IL-1β levels and reduced macrophage infiltration, is conducive to preventing progressive renal damage (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020). Veterinary and preclinical applications in models of inflammatory injury provide a solid foundation for repurposing BBG as a potential therapeutic candidate in conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, such as CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe mechanism by which BBG is hypothesized to exert its renoprotective effects in CKD is centered on its ability to non‐competitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor present on both renal immune and epithelial cells. The P2X7 receptor is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated cation channel that is activated under pathophysiological conditions where extracellular ATP levels are elevated, which frequently occurs during tissue injury and inflammation. Once activated, the P2X7 receptor facilitates the formation of pores in the plasma membrane that allow for the influx of cations and the efflux of cellular contents, thereby precipitating a cascade of intracellular events. One critical downstream consequence of P2X7 activation is the priming and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that, upon activation, recruits the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and pro-caspase-1. This assembly leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase-1, which in turn processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, resulting in their secretion and the amplification of the inflammatory response. Moreover, P2X7 activation can induce pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that further exacerbates tissue injury and inflammation (Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nBBG exerts its effects via a noncompetitive blockade of the P2X7 receptor. In doing so, BBG prevents ATP-induced ion channel opening, thereby blocking the subsequent calcium influx and pore formation that are necessary for downstream inflammasome priming. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that BBG inhibits P2X7 receptor-mediated responses, including the calcium influx and the release of IL-1β from macrophages and other immune cells. In vitro studies with BBG have revealed nanomolar potency in blocking P2X7-mediated activities, which is reflective of its efficacy in dampening the inflammasome-related cytokine cascades (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019). Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that BBG may also interfere with pannexin-1 channels that are thought to facilitate ATP release and further promote inflammasome activation, although the precise relationship between pannexin-1 and P2X7 remains the subject of active research (Ferreira et al., 2016). Consequently, by inhibiting the P2X7 receptor, BBG blocks the ATP-driven initiation of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade. This blockade limits caspase-1 activation and the subsequent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, ultimately reducing local inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrotic remodeling within the renal parenchyma. Evidence from animal models indicates that such inhibition leads to reduced macrophage infiltration, decreased fibrogenic markers, and enhanced tubular cell regeneration, which collectively preserve the integrity of the tubulointerstitial architecture (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the established mechanistic pathway, BBG is expected to exert multifaceted renoprotective effects when applied to models of chronic kidney disease. In the proposed assay evaluating drug effects on renal cells, the expected outcome would involve a significant reduction in ATP-induced inflammasome activation. Specifically, by antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, BBG should lower the levels of active caspase-1, thereby reducing the maturation and extracellular release of IL-1β. This attenuation of inflammasome activation is expected to diminish pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells and mitigate pro-inflammatory cytokine release from resident macrophages. BBG’s inhibition of these pathways would theoretically preserve tubular architecture and limit interstitial fibrosis—a hallmark of progressive CKD. The renoprotective effect is anticipated to be observed as decreased expression of fibrosis markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and heat shock protein-47 (HSP47), as well as reduced collagen deposition, as evidenced in rodent models of UUO and hypertensive nephropathy (Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nAt the molecular level, renal epithelial cells, particularly proximal tubular cells, express both P2X7 receptors and components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Immunohistochemical studies in animal models have demonstrated that under pathological conditions, P2X7 receptor expression is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells and can lead to enhanced production of IL-1β when activated by extracellular ATP (Arulkumaran, 2016; Howarth, 2020). Therefore, BBG is expected to be especially effective in cell types that are critical in the development of inflammation and fibrosis in CKD. By reducing the number of inflammatory cells (such as CD68-positive macrophages) infiltrating the renal parenchyma and by limiting cell death via pyroptosis, BBG may also indirectly reduce the fibrotic signaling that is mediated by cytokines such as TGF-β. This dual effect—both direct inhibition of inflammatory signaling and preservation of renal cell integrity—provides a compelling rationale for BBG’s use in preventing the progression of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nMoreover, BBG’s known safety profile in central nervous system studies and its extensive use as a surgical dye underscore its translational potential. Its water solubility and known pharmacokinetics facilitate dosing strategies that could be adapted for chronic administration in CKD patients. Additionally, the indirect suppression of inflammasome activation through P2X7 antagonism presents a novel approach to modulating the inflammatory microenvironment in the kidney, one that targets a critical nexus of inflammation and fibrosis (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, BBG presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on its ability to noncompetitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor, thereby blocking ATP-induced inflammasome priming and activation. The strengths of BBG include its well-established safety profile, water solubility, and proven efficacy in various rodent models of kidney injury such as hypertensive nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction. Preclinical data indicate that BBG can reduce key mediators of inflammation such as IL-1β, lower caspase-1 activation, and mitigate the deleterious effects of pyroptosis on renal tubular architecture, all of which are central to the pathophysiology of CKD (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain that warrant further investigation. There is limited direct clinical data specifically evaluating BBG in human CKD patients, although the identification of related clinical trials targeting P2X7 and NLRP3 receptors in CKD suggests active interest in this therapeutic approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while BBG’s mechanism of action is well supported by in vitro and animal studies, the potential for differential effects based on receptor splice variants and cell type specificity in renal tissue must be carefully delineated. For instance, recent studies indicate that variations in P2X7 receptor expression and function in the renal vasculature may impact not only inflammatory signaling but also vascular tone, which could influence overall renal perfusion and function (Howarth, 2020).\n\nMoreover, while BBG’s indirect inhibition of the inflammasome pathway via P2X7 antagonism is mechanistically attractive, redundancy in inflammasome activation pathways—such as those that are P2X7-independent—might limit the overall efficacy of BBG as a monotherapy. Some studies have demonstrated that even with effective P2X7 inhibition, alternative pathways may still sustain IL-1β release under inflammatory conditions (Arulkumaran, 2016; Prendecki et al., 2022). Therefore, combination therapies that target multiple nodes in the inflammasome network may ultimately be required to achieve robust clinical benefit.\n\nIn terms of drug development strategies, BBG benefits from its established manufacturing and dosing data, which accelerates early phase clinical trial design and regulatory considerations. In addition, BBG has been successfully used in non-renal contexts—including long-term treatments in models of graft-versus-host disease—without significant toxicity, lending further support to its translational potential (Geraghty et al., 2019). The extensive literature on BBG’s anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in preclinical models provides a solid rationale for advancing this candidate for CKD even as further mechanistic and pharmacodynamic studies are conducted.\n\nWeaknesses of this candidate include the fact that while much of the preclinical data is encouraging, there is still a need for robust clinical trials that specifically assess BBG in CKD. Additionally, given the complexity of CKD pathogenesis—which involves multiple overlapping inflammatory and fibrotic signaling mechanisms—it will be important to determine whether BBG alone can induce sufficient therapeutic benefit or whether it is best applied as part of a combination regimen. Moreover, the potential vascular effects of P2X7 antagonism require further clarification to ensure that systemic hemodynamics are not adversely affected, particularly in patients with existing cardiovascular complications that often accompany CKD (Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall, the mechanistic rationale for BBG centers on its ability to interfere with a critical inflammatory pathway—namely, the ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. This blockade not only reduces the activation of caspase-1 and the release of IL-1β but also limits pyroptotic cell death, preservation of tubular architecture, and ultimately, fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. These effects address key pathogenic mechanisms underlying CKD progression. Moreover, aspects such as its water solubility, known dosing regimens from CNS and surgical applications, and favorable preclinical safety record render BBG an attractive candidate for fast-tracked repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Ferreira et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence reviewed indicates that Brilliant Blue G holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. Its mechanism—centered on noncompetitive antagonism of the P2X7 receptor and consequent suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade—offers a novel approach to preserving renal function by reducing inflammatory injury and fibrosis. While further research, particularly targeted clinical trials in the CKD patient population, is necessary to fully validate its efficacy and safety in this context, the preclinical data and extensive understanding of its molecular interactions support the continued development of BBG for CKD therapy (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nReferences  \nArulkumaran, N.

It belongs to the diarylsulfonylurea class of compounds, which emerged from medicinal chemistry efforts that initially focused on sulfonylurea drugs such as glyburide. Glyburide was found to have anti‐inflammatory properties mediated by inhibition of the NLRP3 complex; however, its clinical utility as an anti-inflammatory agent was limited by its potent effects on insulin release and the consequent risk of hypoglycemia. To overcome these limitations, researchers refined the chemical structure and synthesized MCC950, a derivative that retains the inflammasome inhibitory activity of glyburide without disturbing insulin secretion. The design of MCC950 was based on structure–activity relationship studies that identified the importance of the diarylsulfonylurea moiety, and its eventual discovery positioned it as a gold-standard benchmark compound for NLRP3 inhibition (Kaur et al., 2025; Coll et al., 2019). This compound has been synthesized and purified by several vendors including Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #SML 2233), ensuring reproducibility and accessibility to research teams. Overall, MCC950 represents a promising example of rational drug design aimed at selectively targeting components of the innate immune system and addressing the inflammatory cascades that contribute to disease pathology.\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of MCC950 is marked by extensive preclinical evidence spanning animal models of a wide array of inflammatory disorders. Initially investigated in models of auto-inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, MCC950 quickly emerged as the benchmark inhibitor for studying NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated inflammation. In rodent models of kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, and adenine-induced chronic renal failure, MCC950 has demonstrated significant reductions in proteinuria, attenuated fibrosis, and improvements in overall renal function (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). Preclinical studies conducted in diabetic models have shown that chronic treatment with MCC950 leads to marked improvements in histopathological kidney damage, as evidenced by reduced mesangial expansion and decreased podocyte injury (Zhang et al., 2019). In addition, rodent studies in salt-sensitive hypertensive models reveal that inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome via MCC950 results in lower blood pressure, decreased interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, and reduced collagen deposition in renal tissues (Krishnan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2025). Although robust evidence from animal studies supports its efficacy in models of chronic kidney disease (CKD), clinical translation remains limited with only sparse early-phase clinical trials referenced in the literature (ClinicalTrials.gov). Additionally, the favorable safety profile observed in non-human primate studies further underpins its potential for repurposing in CKD, although more clinical data are needed to fully establish its benefit–risk profile.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nMCC950’s mechanism of action is both specific and well-characterized at the molecular level. The compound exerts its inhibitory effect by directly binding to the Walker B motif located within the NACHT domain of the NLRP3 protein. This binding interferes with the ATP hydrolysis that is essential for NLRP3 activation and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Under normal pathological conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC and the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form. Active caspase-1 then processes pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature forms and also initiates gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death. By preventing ATP hydrolysis, MCC950 locks NLRP3 in an inactive conformation, thereby obstructing the assembly of the entire inflammasome complex, reducing caspase-1 activation and cytokine maturation (Kim et al., 2019; Zhan et al., 2023). In the context of human tubular epithelial cells (TECs), which express NLRP3 and contribute to renal inflammatory cascades, MCC950’s engagement with the Walker B motif is proposed to significantly curb inflammasome formation. Such direct target engagement has been validated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and mutagenesis assays that confirm the drug’s specificity and potency. Blocking inflammasome assembly not only reduces cytokine release but also limits the formation of gasdermin D pores that are responsible for pyroptotic cell death, thereby preventing tubular cell loss and reducing interstitial inflammation (Liu et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven its robust preclinical evidence, the expected effect of MCC950 in assays focusing on CKD and related kidney injury is multifaceted. In in vitro models using human TECs, the hypothesis is that treatment with MCC950 will prevent ATP hydrolysis, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. As a result, the maturation and release of IL-1β and IL-18 will be significantly reduced, ultimately leading to lower levels of pyroptosis, attenuation of inflammation, and prevention of the fibrotic remodeling that often accompanies progressive CKD (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). In vivo, these effects are anticipated to manifest as decreased proteinuria, improved kidney function markers, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, and lower extracellular matrix deposition. This translates into a reduction in renal interstitial fibrosis and a preservation of normal tubular architecture, thereby ameliorating the progressive decline in renal function seen in CKD models. The expression profile of NLRP3 in TECs, coupled with its established role in mediating inflammatory and fibrotic responses, provides a solid rationale for targeting NLRP3 in chronic kidney disease (Zhang et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). The proposed mechanism is in alignment with the pathological features of CKD, where sustained low-grade inflammation and fibrosis lead to irreversible kidney damage.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nMCC950 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease due to several compelling strengths. First, its rational design as a selective NLRP3 inhibitor ensures that it directly targets a critical inflammatory pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of CKD. The extensive preclinical evidence in diverse animal models—from diabetic nephropathy to salt-sensitive hypertension and adenine-induced renal failure—strongly supports its renoprotective effects, including reductions in proteinuria, improved renal function, and diminished fibrotic remodeling (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Sabra et al., 2023). Second, the detailed elucidation of its molecular mechanism—confirming binding to the Walker B motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ATP hydrolysis—provides a clear mechanistic rationale that is essential for translational development (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Third, its favorable pharmacological properties, including oral bioavailability and a safety profile established in non-human primates, further underline its developmental feasibility (Kaur et al., 2025; ClinicalTrials.gov).  \n\nHowever, there are some potential weaknesses that must be carefully considered. Although rodent models have provided robust efficacy data, the translation of these effects to humans remains to be fully validated. There is a paucity of comprehensive clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with MCC950, which introduces uncertainty regarding its efficacy and potential off-target effects in a human patient population. Additionally, while the compound is highly selective for the NLRP3 inflammasome, it is critical to further elucidate its long-term safety and impact on global immune function, given the essential role of inflammasomes in host defense. In some experimental contexts, there has been variability in the inhibition of inflammation and fibrosis depending on the specific disease model, suggesting that its therapeutic window may differ based on disease etiology (Sabra et al., 2023). Despite these challenges, the overall evidence supports the further development of MCC950 as a mechanistic intervention in CKD, particularly in settings where inflammasome-driven pathology is predominant.\n\nIn summary, MCC950 is a well-characterized, rationally designed NLRP3 inhibitor with strong preclinical evidence demonstrating its renoprotective effects in various models of chronic kidney disease. Its specific binding to the Walker B motif of the NLRP3 NACHT domain and subsequent inhibition of ATP hydrolysis form the basis of its mechanism, reducing caspase-1 activation, IL-1β/IL-18 maturation, and gasdermin-D-mediated pyroptosis. These actions are expected to translate into reduced tubular epithelial cell death, diminished interstitial inflammation, and alleviation of fibrotic remodeling—key pathological processes in CKD progression. While further clinical validation is necessary, the strengths in mechanistic rationale, preclinical efficacy data, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties position MCC950 as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Coll et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022).\n\nReferences  \nColl, R.

"(Brilliant Blue G, 1)","(Oridonin, 6)","Candidate 1 (Brilliant Blue G, BBG) has extensive and directly relevant preclinical data in multiple rodent models of renal injury, including unilateral ureteral obstruction and hypertensive nephropathy, demonstrating reductions in inflammation, fibrosis, and tubular cell death. Its mechanism—noncompetitive antagonism of P2X7 receptors—targets an upstream driver of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis, core pathological processes in CKD. BBG benefits from a well-characterized safety profile in ophthalmic and CNS applications, with high water solubility and established manufacturing and dosing protocols that de-risk translational development. Although redundancy in inflammasome activation pathways may limit monotherapy efficacy, combination approaches remain feasible. Candidate 2 (Oridonin) offers a novel, direct covalent inhibition of NLRP3 via binding to cysteine 279, with additional anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects through NF-κB, p38-MAPK, and Nrf2 modulation. However, most efficacy data come from non-renal or acute inflammatory models, and evidence for specific benefits in CKD or podocyte preservation is limited. Oridonin faces formulation and bioavailability challenges for chronic dosing, and its broader polypharmacology raises potential off-target and toxicity concerns.

BBG is part of the broad class of blue dyes that have been extensively studied for their ability to interact with the purinergic receptor family, most notably acting as a non‐competitive antagonist of the P2X7 receptor. The compound’s chemical structure confers high water solubility and the ability to be administered at defined doses with a favorable safety profile, as demonstrated by its routine use in ophthalmic surgery and CNS studies without systemic toxicity. In its role as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, BBG has been used in various preclinical studies investigating inflammatory and cell death pathways. Its synthetic origin and established manufacturing process, as offered by suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #B0770), support its scalability for repurposing in chronic diseases. BBG belongs to a class of small molecules that modulate ion channel function, particularly by binding to the ATP‐activated P2X7 receptor, which has been implicated in various inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. This class of compounds has been employed not only for their staining properties but also for their ability to interfere with cellular signaling events related to inflammation, rendering them of considerable interest in conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD) where inflammation and fibrosis are critical pathogenic factors (Ferreira et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nHistorically, Brilliant Blue G has been most widely recognized as a histological staining agent with established safety in both preclinical and clinical contexts, particularly within the neuroprotective field. Its pharmacological actions extend to antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, and preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in animal models of inflammatory diseases, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and various neurodegenerative conditions. More recently, BBG has been evaluated in rodent models of kidney disease. For example, in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) models—a widely used experimental model that mimics tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis—BBG treatment has been observed to reduce inflammation, diminish interstitial fibrosis, and promote tubular cell regeneration (Pereira et al., 2020). In rodent hypertensive nephropathy models, BBG has also been reported to modulate renal vascular resistance and alter tubular injury markers, suggesting that its renoprotective effects might extend to a broader spectrum of CKD–related pathologies. Although clinical trials directly targeting chronic kidney disease with BBG have not yet been detailed in the public literature, searches in ClinicalTrials.gov using terms related to “Brilliant Blue G OR P2X7 antagonist OR P2X7 inhibitor OR NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have identified several ongoing studies investigating similar P2X7 blockade strategies in CKD, which support the translational potential of this approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Prior investigations in animal models of lupus nephritis and hypertensive kidney disease have indicated that BBG’s anti‐inflammatory profile, including decreased IL-1β levels and reduced macrophage infiltration, is conducive to preventing progressive renal damage (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020). Veterinary and preclinical applications in models of inflammatory injury provide a solid foundation for repurposing BBG as a potential therapeutic candidate in conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, such as CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe mechanism by which BBG is hypothesized to exert its renoprotective effects in CKD is centered on its ability to non‐competitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor present on both renal immune and epithelial cells. The P2X7 receptor is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated cation channel that is activated under pathophysiological conditions where extracellular ATP levels are elevated, which frequently occurs during tissue injury and inflammation. Once activated, the P2X7 receptor facilitates the formation of pores in the plasma membrane that allow for the influx of cations and the efflux of cellular contents, thereby precipitating a cascade of intracellular events. One critical downstream consequence of P2X7 activation is the priming and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that, upon activation, recruits the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and pro-caspase-1. This assembly leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase-1, which in turn processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, resulting in their secretion and the amplification of the inflammatory response. Moreover, P2X7 activation can induce pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that further exacerbates tissue injury and inflammation (Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nBBG exerts its effects via a noncompetitive blockade of the P2X7 receptor. In doing so, BBG prevents ATP-induced ion channel opening, thereby blocking the subsequent calcium influx and pore formation that are necessary for downstream inflammasome priming. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that BBG inhibits P2X7 receptor-mediated responses, including the calcium influx and the release of IL-1β from macrophages and other immune cells. In vitro studies with BBG have revealed nanomolar potency in blocking P2X7-mediated activities, which is reflective of its efficacy in dampening the inflammasome-related cytokine cascades (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019). Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that BBG may also interfere with pannexin-1 channels that are thought to facilitate ATP release and further promote inflammasome activation, although the precise relationship between pannexin-1 and P2X7 remains the subject of active research (Ferreira et al., 2016). Consequently, by inhibiting the P2X7 receptor, BBG blocks the ATP-driven initiation of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade. This blockade limits caspase-1 activation and the subsequent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, ultimately reducing local inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrotic remodeling within the renal parenchyma. Evidence from animal models indicates that such inhibition leads to reduced macrophage infiltration, decreased fibrogenic markers, and enhanced tubular cell regeneration, which collectively preserve the integrity of the tubulointerstitial architecture (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the established mechanistic pathway, BBG is expected to exert multifaceted renoprotective effects when applied to models of chronic kidney disease. In the proposed assay evaluating drug effects on renal cells, the expected outcome would involve a significant reduction in ATP-induced inflammasome activation. Specifically, by antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, BBG should lower the levels of active caspase-1, thereby reducing the maturation and extracellular release of IL-1β. This attenuation of inflammasome activation is expected to diminish pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells and mitigate pro-inflammatory cytokine release from resident macrophages. BBG’s inhibition of these pathways would theoretically preserve tubular architecture and limit interstitial fibrosis—a hallmark of progressive CKD. The renoprotective effect is anticipated to be observed as decreased expression of fibrosis markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and heat shock protein-47 (HSP47), as well as reduced collagen deposition, as evidenced in rodent models of UUO and hypertensive nephropathy (Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nAt the molecular level, renal epithelial cells, particularly proximal tubular cells, express both P2X7 receptors and components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Immunohistochemical studies in animal models have demonstrated that under pathological conditions, P2X7 receptor expression is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells and can lead to enhanced production of IL-1β when activated by extracellular ATP (Arulkumaran, 2016; Howarth, 2020). Therefore, BBG is expected to be especially effective in cell types that are critical in the development of inflammation and fibrosis in CKD. By reducing the number of inflammatory cells (such as CD68-positive macrophages) infiltrating the renal parenchyma and by limiting cell death via pyroptosis, BBG may also indirectly reduce the fibrotic signaling that is mediated by cytokines such as TGF-β. This dual effect—both direct inhibition of inflammatory signaling and preservation of renal cell integrity—provides a compelling rationale for BBG’s use in preventing the progression of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nMoreover, BBG’s known safety profile in central nervous system studies and its extensive use as a surgical dye underscore its translational potential. Its water solubility and known pharmacokinetics facilitate dosing strategies that could be adapted for chronic administration in CKD patients. Additionally, the indirect suppression of inflammasome activation through P2X7 antagonism presents a novel approach to modulating the inflammatory microenvironment in the kidney, one that targets a critical nexus of inflammation and fibrosis (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, BBG presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on its ability to noncompetitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor, thereby blocking ATP-induced inflammasome priming and activation. The strengths of BBG include its well-established safety profile, water solubility, and proven efficacy in various rodent models of kidney injury such as hypertensive nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction. Preclinical data indicate that BBG can reduce key mediators of inflammation such as IL-1β, lower caspase-1 activation, and mitigate the deleterious effects of pyroptosis on renal tubular architecture, all of which are central to the pathophysiology of CKD (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain that warrant further investigation. There is limited direct clinical data specifically evaluating BBG in human CKD patients, although the identification of related clinical trials targeting P2X7 and NLRP3 receptors in CKD suggests active interest in this therapeutic approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while BBG’s mechanism of action is well supported by in vitro and animal studies, the potential for differential effects based on receptor splice variants and cell type specificity in renal tissue must be carefully delineated. For instance, recent studies indicate that variations in P2X7 receptor expression and function in the renal vasculature may impact not only inflammatory signaling but also vascular tone, which could influence overall renal perfusion and function (Howarth, 2020).\n\nMoreover, while BBG’s indirect inhibition of the inflammasome pathway via P2X7 antagonism is mechanistically attractive, redundancy in inflammasome activation pathways—such as those that are P2X7-independent—might limit the overall efficacy of BBG as a monotherapy. Some studies have demonstrated that even with effective P2X7 inhibition, alternative pathways may still sustain IL-1β release under inflammatory conditions (Arulkumaran, 2016; Prendecki et al., 2022). Therefore, combination therapies that target multiple nodes in the inflammasome network may ultimately be required to achieve robust clinical benefit.\n\nIn terms of drug development strategies, BBG benefits from its established manufacturing and dosing data, which accelerates early phase clinical trial design and regulatory considerations. In addition, BBG has been successfully used in non-renal contexts—including long-term treatments in models of graft-versus-host disease—without significant toxicity, lending further support to its translational potential (Geraghty et al., 2019). The extensive literature on BBG’s anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in preclinical models provides a solid rationale for advancing this candidate for CKD even as further mechanistic and pharmacodynamic studies are conducted.\n\nWeaknesses of this candidate include the fact that while much of the preclinical data is encouraging, there is still a need for robust clinical trials that specifically assess BBG in CKD. Additionally, given the complexity of CKD pathogenesis—which involves multiple overlapping inflammatory and fibrotic signaling mechanisms—it will be important to determine whether BBG alone can induce sufficient therapeutic benefit or whether it is best applied as part of a combination regimen. Moreover, the potential vascular effects of P2X7 antagonism require further clarification to ensure that systemic hemodynamics are not adversely affected, particularly in patients with existing cardiovascular complications that often accompany CKD (Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall, the mechanistic rationale for BBG centers on its ability to interfere with a critical inflammatory pathway—namely, the ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. This blockade not only reduces the activation of caspase-1 and the release of IL-1β but also limits pyroptotic cell death, preservation of tubular architecture, and ultimately, fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. These effects address key pathogenic mechanisms underlying CKD progression. Moreover, aspects such as its water solubility, known dosing regimens from CNS and surgical applications, and favorable preclinical safety record render BBG an attractive candidate for fast-tracked repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Ferreira et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence reviewed indicates that Brilliant Blue G holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. Its mechanism—centered on noncompetitive antagonism of the P2X7 receptor and consequent suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade—offers a novel approach to preserving renal function by reducing inflammatory injury and fibrosis. While further research, particularly targeted clinical trials in the CKD patient population, is necessary to fully validate its efficacy and safety in this context, the preclinical data and extensive understanding of its molecular interactions support the continued development of BBG for CKD therapy (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nReferences  \nArulkumaran, N.

As a kaurane-type diterpenoid, its structure comprises four isoprene units arranged into a characteristic tetracyclic skeleton, which is emblematic of this class of natural products. The compound’s discovery and development emerged from the long-standing tradition of using Rabdosia rubescens (also known as Donglingcao) in Asian folk medicine, where it was historically applied for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In the broader context of drug development, diterpenoids such as oridonin have been recognized for their “drug-like” properties; they have provided scaffolds for synthetic modifications aimed at improving potency, solubility, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Moreover, the extraction and study of oridonin reflect an important paradigm in natural products research, wherein historical use is validated and expanded upon with modern medicinal chemistry techniques. This compound, commercially available from suppliers like Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #O2015), fits well within the class of small-molecule natural products that have been repurposed for modern therapeutic applications in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases (Ding et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOridonin’s use spans a broad spectrum of therapeutic applications. Traditionally, the herbal preparations containing oridonin were employed in Chinese medicine to alleviate conditions ranging from pharyngitis and gingivitis to various inflammatory and tumorous conditions. With the advent of modern biochemical and pharmacological research, oridonin has been extensively studied for its anticancer efficacy; many preclinical studies have demonstrated its capacity to induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and suppress metastasis in a variety of cancer cell lines (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In addition to its anticancer properties, several studies have documented oridonin’s robust anti-inflammatory actions. Notably, oridonin has shown efficacy in experimental models of colitis and gout through its inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that mediates the maturation of IL-1β and is a critical driver of inflammatory responses (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020). Although most of the historical and ongoing research has emphasized oridonin’s anticancer and acute inflammatory indications, there is emerging interest in its potential role in renal pathologies. A search on ClinicalTrials.gov using terms such as “Oridonin AND kidney OR renal OR chronic kidney disease OR glomerulonephritis OR proteinuria OR glomerular” returned tens of thousands of trials, indicating significant research activity into natural products and potentially repurposed compounds for kidney diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, to date there is limited direct clinical evidence of oridonin being deployed specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preclinical studies, particularly those involving rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and ischemia–reperfusion injury, have demonstrated renoprotective effects such as reduced inflammatory cytokine levels, diminished fibrosis markers, and improved renal function parameters; these effects suggest that oridonin or its derivatives might be promising candidates for treating CKD or similar renal conditions (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, oridonin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects primarily through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex known to activate caspase-1 and mediate the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. Recent mechanistic studies have shown that oridonin covalently binds to cysteine 279 within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, a critical residue required for the ATPase activity of NLRP3 and its subsequent oligomerization (He et al., 2018). This binding effectively prevents the conformational changes necessary for the recruitment of NEK7, thereby halting inflammasome assembly and activation. In macrophages, this inhibition leads to a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and attenuates inflammatory cell recruitment—a mechanism that has been validated through pull‐down assays and mass spectrometry, which demonstrated nanomolar potency of oridonin in suppressing NLRP3 activation (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020).\n\nBeyond its direct interaction with the NLRP3 inflammasome, oridonin has been shown to modulate additional signaling pathways. For example, it can inhibit NF-κB and p38-MAPK activation, further blunting the inflammatory response, and it has been implicated in the activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidative defenses at lower concentrations, contributing to its cytoprotective effects (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019). These multifaceted actions underscore the polypharmacological nature of oridonin: while its primary mode of action appears to involve covalent modification of NLRP3, its downstream effects extend into a broader anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative network. This convergence on inflammatory signaling pathways is particularly relevant because overactivation of the inflammasome and subsequent pyroptotic cell death are implicated not only in acute inflammatory diseases but also in chronic fibrotic processes within the kidney (Ding et al., 2020).\n\nExpanding the context to renal pathology, the hypothesis driving our proposal is that human podocytes—which are essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier—express components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of NLRP3 in these cells has been linked to pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, which in turn contributes to podocyte loss, proteinuria, and interstitial fibrosis, all hallmarks of CKD. Although most direct evidence of oridonin’s NLRP3 inhibition comes from studies in immune cells like macrophages (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2016), the underlying mechanism is conserved across cell types. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that oridonin could similarly inhibit NLRP3 activation in podocytes, thereby preventing inflammasome assembly, blocking caspase-1 activation, and ultimately reducing the release of IL-1β (Li et al., 2021). By precluding these downstream events, oridonin may attenuate the cycle of inflammatory damage and fibrosis that underpins progressive renal injury in CKD (Li et al., 2021).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the proposed assays and eventual in vivo models of chronic kidney disease, the expected effect of oridonin centers on its ability to protect podocytes from NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated injury. More specifically, by covalently binding to cysteine 279 in NLRP3, oridonin is anticipated to inhibit ATP hydrolysis and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex. This mechanistic blockade should result in a reduction of caspase-1 activation—a key step in the maturation of IL-1β—and thereby diminish the secretion of this potent pro-inflammatory cytokine (He et al., 2018). In podocytes, such suppression is expected to reduce pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death that directly compromises the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and leads to proteinuria. Preservation of podocyte viability would, in turn, help maintain glomerular barrier integrity, minimizing the leakage of plasma proteins into the urine and limiting the ensuing fibrotic response in the renal interstitium (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nMoreover, the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB and p38-MAPK signaling pathways could provide additional benefits by reducing overall renal inflammation. In animal models of kidney injury—such as those induced by ischemia–reperfusion or diabetic nephropathy—treatment with compounds that inhibit these pathways has been correlated with improved renal function parameters (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021). Therefore, beyond its direct effect on podocyte inflammasome activity, oridonin may exert broader renoprotective actions by dampening inflammatory cascades that contribute to interstitial fibrosis and progressive renal insufficiency. In this context, oridonin’s oral bioavailability and established history in traditional medicine support the feasibility of translating these preclinical findings into clinical benefit for CKD patients (Su et al., 2024).\n\nIt is important to note that while direct evidence of oridonin’s effects on human podocytes remains to be fully elucidated, the expression of NLRP3 in podocytes has been demonstrated in experimental models of CKD. Additionally, studies involving natural products that inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome—such as fucoidan in diabetic kidney disease—have provided supportive mechanistic insights, suggesting that the targeting of inflammasome activation in podocytes is a viable therapeutic strategy (Wang et al., 2022).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nOverall, oridonin emerges as a compelling therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease, given its well-documented mechanism of inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome and its extensive background in modulating inflammatory pathways. Its natural origin and historical use in traditional Chinese medicine provide a robust basis for its safety profile, and preclinical studies have demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, including models of colitis, gout, and even acute kidney injury (Ding et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2021). Strengths of oridonin include its specificity for NLRP3 via covalent binding to a critical cysteine residue, which has been shown to yield nanomolar potency in relevant assays (He et al., 2018). Additionally, oridonin’s ability to modulate secondary pathways (NF-κB, p38-MAPK, and Nrf2) may amplify its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective benefits, addressing multiple facets of CKD pathophysiology ranging from podocyte loss to interstitial fibrosis (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nHowever, several weaknesses must also be considered. Despite promising preclinical data in other disease models, direct evidence for oridonin’s efficacy in modulating NLRP3 activation specifically in podocytes remains limited. Most mechanistic studies have been conducted in macrophages or other cell types, and while the extrapolation is reasonable given the conserved nature of inflammasome signaling, dedicated studies using human podocytes are needed to substantiate the proposed protective effects on proteinuria and interstitial fibrosis (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Furthermore, issues such as moderate potency, limited solubility, and variable bioavailability have been noted with oridonin, necessitating further formulation and structural optimization to ensure therapeutic efficacy in a clinical setting (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). These pharmacokinetic considerations are particularly critical for a chronic indication like CKD, where long-term dosing and sustained target engagement are required.\n\nAnother consideration is the translation of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects observed in acute injury models or non-renal tissue into the context of chronic kidney disease, which involves complex and multifactorial pathophysiology. Although the suppression of inflammasome-driven pyroptosis is a promising target for preventing podocyte injury, CKD progression involves additional factors such as hemodynamic stress, metabolic derangements, and immune dysregulation that may not be fully addressed by NLRP3 inhibition alone (Huang et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2020). Consequently, while the mechanistic specificity of oridonin is appealing, its efficacy in a multifaceted chronic disease state like CKD requires rigorous preclinical validation followed by carefully designed clinical trials.\n\nIn summary, oridonin holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease based on its robust anti-inflammatory mechanism, particularly its ability to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome via covalent binding to cysteine 279. The compound’s multifaceted mechanism—encompassing inhibition of caspase-1 activation, IL-1β maturation, and subsequent pyroptosis—could translate into preservation of podocyte integrity, reduction in proteinuria, and attenuation of interstitial fibrosis, all of which are critical endpoints in CKD management (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Nonetheless, challenges related to drug solubility, bioavailability, and the direct demonstration of efficacy in podocytes must be addressed. Given its strong preclinical validation in other inflammatory conditions, further targeted studies focusing on its renal effects and optimization of drug-like properties are warranted before it can be advanced as a viable treatment for CKD (Tan et al., 2021; Su et al., 2024). Overall, while there is a clear mechanistic rationale supporting the therapeutic potential of oridonin in CKD, additional studies specifically assessing its effects in relevant renal cell types and chronic disease models will be critical to fully validate its clinical utility.\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

"(Tranilast, 3)","(Brilliant Blue G, 1)","Both candidates target inflammatory and fibrotic pathways implicated in CKD progression, but they differ in evidence depth, mechanistic specificity, safety, and translational readiness.

1. Strength and Relevance of Evidence: BBG has robust rodent data in UUO, hypertensive nephropathy, and lupus nephritis models demonstrating reduced IL-1β, macrophage infiltration, fibrosis, and improved tubular architecture. ClinicalTrials.gov searches show trials of P2X7 antagonism in CKD, but no BBG-specific studies. Tranilast has preclinical efficacy in diabetic nephropathy and UUO models, and limited human data in early diabetic nephropathy patients show reduced urinary collagen IV and albuminuria when co-administered with ACE inhibitors, albeit without dedicated CKD trials.

2. Mechanism of Action: BBG is a noncompetitive P2X7 antagonist, indirectly blocking NLRP3 inflammasome priming via reduced ATP-gated ion flux. Its MoA is plausible but upstream, with potential redundancy via P2X7-independent inflammasome activation and unclear vascular effects. Tranilast directly disrupts NLRP3–ASC and NLRP3–NEK7 interactions, blocking inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation, while also attenuating TGF-β/Smad2 and PDGF signaling to suppress fibrosis. This dual and direct targeting of core CKD drivers is mechanistically compelling.

3. Safety and Tolerability: BBG’s safety profile is established in ophthalmic and CNS settings and in rodent chronic models, but systemic chronic PK, ADME, and vascular liabilities in CKD patients remain uncharacterized. Tranilast has decades of oral clinical use as an anti-allergic, well-characterized PK/PD, and tolerability data, with manageable off-target immunomodulatory events.

4. Feasibility and Delivery: BBG’s water solubility facilitates dosing, but chronic systemic delivery and kidney exposure levels require further PK/ADME studies. Tranilast’s oral bioavailability, known dosing regimens, and human pharmacology support rapid translation and standardized delivery to renal tissues.

5. Novelty Balanced with Evidence: BBG repurposes a known P2X7 antagonist with established preclinical efficacy but indirect inflammasome inhibition. Tranilast offers novel direct NLRP3 inhibition plus anti-fibrotic activity, supported by structural and functional studies (EMBO Mol Med 2018), and has clinical precedence.

Overall, while BBG has extensive rodent inflammation/fibrosis data, its indirect MoA, limited human safety data for chronic use, and potential off-target vascular effects diminish its translational appeal relative to a direct inflammasome/fibrosis inhibitor with proven oral safety.","Tranilast (ID 3) is the stronger candidate. Its direct, dual-action MoA against the NLRP3 inflammasome and TGF-β/PDGF fibrotic pathways addresses both upstream inflammatory triggers and downstream fibrogenesis central to CKD. Tranilast’s decades-long oral safety record and initial clinical signals in diabetic nephropathy provide a clear path to early-phase trials, whereas BBG (ID 1), despite promising rodent data, relies on indirect P2X7 antagonism, lacks chronic systemic PK/safety in humans, and faces redundancy in inflammasome activation. Thus, Tranilast offers higher translational potential and lower risk.",16,"(1, 3)","{'hypothesis': 'Brilliant Blue G (BBG; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #B0770)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Brilliant Blue G (BBG; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #B0770)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nBrilliant Blue G (BBG) is a synthetic dye originally developed for use in food and as a surgical visualizing agent that has been repurposed as a pharmacological agent. BBG is part of the broad class of blue dyes that have been extensively studied for their ability to interact with the purinergic receptor family, most notably acting as a non‐competitive antagonist of the P2X7 receptor. The compound’s chemical structure confers high water solubility and the ability to be administered at defined doses with a favorable safety profile, as demonstrated by its routine use in ophthalmic surgery and CNS studies without systemic toxicity. In its role as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, BBG has been used in various preclinical studies investigating inflammatory and cell death pathways. Its synthetic origin and established manufacturing process, as offered by suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #B0770), support its scalability for repurposing in chronic diseases. BBG belongs to a class of small molecules that modulate ion channel function, particularly by binding to the ATP‐activated P2X7 receptor, which has been implicated in various inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. This class of compounds has been employed not only for their staining properties but also for their ability to interfere with cellular signaling events related to inflammation, rendering them of considerable interest in conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD) where inflammation and fibrosis are critical pathogenic factors (Ferreira et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nHistorically, Brilliant Blue G has been most widely recognized as a histological staining agent with established safety in both preclinical and clinical contexts, particularly within the neuroprotective field. Its pharmacological actions extend to antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, and preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in animal models of inflammatory diseases, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and various neurodegenerative conditions. More recently, BBG has been evaluated in rodent models of kidney disease. For example, in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) models—a widely used experimental model that mimics tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis—BBG treatment has been observed to reduce inflammation, diminish interstitial fibrosis, and promote tubular cell regeneration (Pereira et al., 2020). In rodent hypertensive nephropathy models, BBG has also been reported to modulate renal vascular resistance and alter tubular injury markers, suggesting that its renoprotective effects might extend to a broader spectrum of CKD–related pathologies. Although clinical trials directly targeting chronic kidney disease with BBG have not yet been detailed in the public literature, searches in ClinicalTrials.gov using terms related to “Brilliant Blue G OR P2X7 antagonist OR P2X7 inhibitor OR NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have identified several ongoing studies investigating similar P2X7 blockade strategies in CKD, which support the translational potential of this approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Prior investigations in animal models of lupus nephritis and hypertensive kidney disease have indicated that BBG’s anti‐inflammatory profile, including decreased IL-1β levels and reduced macrophage infiltration, is conducive to preventing progressive renal damage (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020). Veterinary and preclinical applications in models of inflammatory injury provide a solid foundation for repurposing BBG as a potential therapeutic candidate in conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, such as CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe mechanism by which BBG is hypothesized to exert its renoprotective effects in CKD is centered on its ability to non‐competitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor present on both renal immune and epithelial cells. The P2X7 receptor is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated cation channel that is activated under pathophysiological conditions where extracellular ATP levels are elevated, which frequently occurs during tissue injury and inflammation. Once activated, the P2X7 receptor facilitates the formation of pores in the plasma membrane that allow for the influx of cations and the efflux of cellular contents, thereby precipitating a cascade of intracellular events. One critical downstream consequence of P2X7 activation is the priming and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that, upon activation, recruits the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and pro-caspase-1. This assembly leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase-1, which in turn processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, resulting in their secretion and the amplification of the inflammatory response. Moreover, P2X7 activation can induce pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that further exacerbates tissue injury and inflammation (Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nBBG exerts its effects via a noncompetitive blockade of the P2X7 receptor. In doing so, BBG prevents ATP-induced ion channel opening, thereby blocking the subsequent calcium influx and pore formation that are necessary for downstream inflammasome priming. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that BBG inhibits P2X7 receptor-mediated responses, including the calcium influx and the release of IL-1β from macrophages and other immune cells. In vitro studies with BBG have revealed nanomolar potency in blocking P2X7-mediated activities, which is reflective of its efficacy in dampening the inflammasome-related cytokine cascades (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019). Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that BBG may also interfere with pannexin-1 channels that are thought to facilitate ATP release and further promote inflammasome activation, although the precise relationship between pannexin-1 and P2X7 remains the subject of active research (Ferreira et al., 2016). Consequently, by inhibiting the P2X7 receptor, BBG blocks the ATP-driven initiation of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade. This blockade limits caspase-1 activation and the subsequent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, ultimately reducing local inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrotic remodeling within the renal parenchyma. Evidence from animal models indicates that such inhibition leads to reduced macrophage infiltration, decreased fibrogenic markers, and enhanced tubular cell regeneration, which collectively preserve the integrity of the tubulointerstitial architecture (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the established mechanistic pathway, BBG is expected to exert multifaceted renoprotective effects when applied to models of chronic kidney disease. In the proposed assay evaluating drug effects on renal cells, the expected outcome would involve a significant reduction in ATP-induced inflammasome activation. Specifically, by antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, BBG should lower the levels of active caspase-1, thereby reducing the maturation and extracellular release of IL-1β. This attenuation of inflammasome activation is expected to diminish pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells and mitigate pro-inflammatory cytokine release from resident macrophages. BBG’s inhibition of these pathways would theoretically preserve tubular architecture and limit interstitial fibrosis—a hallmark of progressive CKD. The renoprotective effect is anticipated to be observed as decreased expression of fibrosis markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and heat shock protein-47 (HSP47), as well as reduced collagen deposition, as evidenced in rodent models of UUO and hypertensive nephropathy (Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nAt the molecular level, renal epithelial cells, particularly proximal tubular cells, express both P2X7 receptors and components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Immunohistochemical studies in animal models have demonstrated that under pathological conditions, P2X7 receptor expression is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells and can lead to enhanced production of IL-1β when activated by extracellular ATP (Arulkumaran, 2016; Howarth, 2020). Therefore, BBG is expected to be especially effective in cell types that are critical in the development of inflammation and fibrosis in CKD. By reducing the number of inflammatory cells (such as CD68-positive macrophages) infiltrating the renal parenchyma and by limiting cell death via pyroptosis, BBG may also indirectly reduce the fibrotic signaling that is mediated by cytokines such as TGF-β. This dual effect—both direct inhibition of inflammatory signaling and preservation of renal cell integrity—provides a compelling rationale for BBG’s use in preventing the progression of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nMoreover, BBG’s known safety profile in central nervous system studies and its extensive use as a surgical dye underscore its translational potential. Its water solubility and known pharmacokinetics facilitate dosing strategies that could be adapted for chronic administration in CKD patients. Additionally, the indirect suppression of inflammasome activation through P2X7 antagonism presents a novel approach to modulating the inflammatory microenvironment in the kidney, one that targets a critical nexus of inflammation and fibrosis (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, BBG presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on its ability to noncompetitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor, thereby blocking ATP-induced inflammasome priming and activation. The strengths of BBG include its well-established safety profile, water solubility, and proven efficacy in various rodent models of kidney injury such as hypertensive nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction. Preclinical data indicate that BBG can reduce key mediators of inflammation such as IL-1β, lower caspase-1 activation, and mitigate the deleterious effects of pyroptosis on renal tubular architecture, all of which are central to the pathophysiology of CKD (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain that warrant further investigation. There is limited direct clinical data specifically evaluating BBG in human CKD patients, although the identification of related clinical trials targeting P2X7 and NLRP3 receptors in CKD suggests active interest in this therapeutic approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while BBG’s mechanism of action is well supported by in vitro and animal studies, the potential for differential effects based on receptor splice variants and cell type specificity in renal tissue must be carefully delineated. For instance, recent studies indicate that variations in P2X7 receptor expression and function in the renal vasculature may impact not only inflammatory signaling but also vascular tone, which could influence overall renal perfusion and function (Howarth, 2020).\n\nMoreover, while BBG’s indirect inhibition of the inflammasome pathway via P2X7 antagonism is mechanistically attractive, redundancy in inflammasome activation pathways—such as those that are P2X7-independent—might limit the overall efficacy of BBG as a monotherapy. Some studies have demonstrated that even with effective P2X7 inhibition, alternative pathways may still sustain IL-1β release under inflammatory conditions (Arulkumaran, 2016; Prendecki et al., 2022). Therefore, combination therapies that target multiple nodes in the inflammasome network may ultimately be required to achieve robust clinical benefit.\n\nIn terms of drug development strategies, BBG benefits from its established manufacturing and dosing data, which accelerates early phase clinical trial design and regulatory considerations. In addition, BBG has been successfully used in non-renal contexts—including long-term treatments in models of graft-versus-host disease—without significant toxicity, lending further support to its translational potential (Geraghty et al., 2019). The extensive literature on BBG’s anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in preclinical models provides a solid rationale for advancing this candidate for CKD even as further mechanistic and pharmacodynamic studies are conducted.\n\nWeaknesses of this candidate include the fact that while much of the preclinical data is encouraging, there is still a need for robust clinical trials that specifically assess BBG in CKD. Additionally, given the complexity of CKD pathogenesis—which involves multiple overlapping inflammatory and fibrotic signaling mechanisms—it will be important to determine whether BBG alone can induce sufficient therapeutic benefit or whether it is best applied as part of a combination regimen. Moreover, the potential vascular effects of P2X7 antagonism require further clarification to ensure that systemic hemodynamics are not adversely affected, particularly in patients with existing cardiovascular complications that often accompany CKD (Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall, the mechanistic rationale for BBG centers on its ability to interfere with a critical inflammatory pathway—namely, the ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. This blockade not only reduces the activation of caspase-1 and the release of IL-1β but also limits pyroptotic cell death, preservation of tubular architecture, and ultimately, fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. These effects address key pathogenic mechanisms underlying CKD progression. Moreover, aspects such as its water solubility, known dosing regimens from CNS and surgical applications, and favorable preclinical safety record render BBG an attractive candidate for fast-tracked repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Ferreira et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence reviewed indicates that Brilliant Blue G holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. Its mechanism—centered on noncompetitive antagonism of the P2X7 receptor and consequent suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade—offers a novel approach to preserving renal function by reducing inflammatory injury and fibrosis. While further research, particularly targeted clinical trials in the CKD patient population, is necessary to fully validate its efficacy and safety in this context, the preclinical data and extensive understanding of its molecular interactions support the continued development of BBG for CKD therapy (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nReferences  \nArulkumaran, N.

Chemically, it is an anthranilic acid derivative, specifically N-[3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl]-anthranilic acid, synthesized initially to treat allergic conditions such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and cutaneous disorders, including keloids and hypertrophic scars (Gilbert et al., 2012). The compound belongs to a class of agents that modulate inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways. The early synthesis of tranilast involved modifying the cinnamoyl anthranilate moiety to enhance potency against pro-fibrotic mediators like transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) while maintaining an acceptable toxicity profile. Over time, the compound’s anti-allergic properties were expanded by preclinical findings that demonstrated its potential to inhibit fibrotic changes via modulation of cytokine signaling and cellular proliferation pathways. This class of anthranilic acid derivatives has been used both in dermatologic and immunologic contexts, providing a background of clinical utility and safety that benefits the repurposing efforts for conditions such as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nTranilast has a well-documented history in clinical settings as an anti-allergic drug since its introduction in Japan decades ago. Its traditional indications have included treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and prevention of keloid formation. More recently, emerging preclinical studies have evaluated tranilast for its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in multiple organ systems. Notably, in experimental animal models of renal disease, tranilast has been investigated in contexts such as diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In these models, tranilast demonstrated the ability to reduce proteinuria, improve kidney structural integrity, and diminish collagen deposition (Gilbert et al., 2012). For instance, in diabetic nephropathy studies, tranilast reduced albuminuria and slowed the decline in glomerular filtration rate through attenuation of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix accumulation. Additionally, human studies in early-stage CKD patients, particularly those with diabetic nephropathy, receiving tranilast combined with standard therapies such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs have shown reductions in urinary markers like collagen type IV and albumin excretion (Gilbert et al., 2012). Beyond renal applications, the compound’s repurposing has been explored in cardiovascular contexts and even in certain inflammatory conditions driven by aberrant inflammasome activation, suggesting a versatility that supports further investigation into its utility against CKD. However, review of ClinicalTrials.gov did not reveal any registered trials directly assessing tranilast in CKD or related renal fibrosis, indicating that while preclinical and limited clinical observations are encouraging, robust clinical evaluation in CKD remains to be undertaken (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe hypothesized mechanism for tranilast in CKD centers on its ability to inhibit key inflammatory and fibrotic processes via direct intervention in inflammasome biology. Tranilast’s molecular target is the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex that plays a pivotal role in innate inflammatory responses. The assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires a coordinated interaction among NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and the serine/threonine kinase NEK7. Activation of this complex ultimately leads to the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form, which subsequently processes pro-IL-1β into IL-1β, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that drives pyroptosis and contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Specifically, tranilast is proposed to disrupt the critical interactions between NLRP3 and ASC as well as between NLRP3 and NEK7. This disruption is believed to occur via direct binding to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3, which is essential for its oligomerization and subsequent recruitment of ASC. By preventing ASC oligomerization, tranilast effectively halts the assembly of the inflammasome, thereby blocking caspase-1 activation and reducing IL-1β secretion (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).\n\nIn addition to inflammasome disruption, tranilast has been shown to attenuate TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling—another major contributor to kidney disease progression. TGF-β is well documented as a central mediator of extracellular matrix synthesis and fibroblast activation, and its overexpression in chronic kidney injury drives interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. Tranilast’s inhibition of TGF-β signaling includes the suppression of Smad2 phosphorylation and downstream fibrotic responses, leading to reductions in collagen deposition and interstitial matrix accumulation (Gilbert et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2019). Furthermore, tranilast’s capacity to inhibit PDGF signaling reduces mesangial cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in the renal glomerulus, providing an additional mechanistic avenue through which it exerts its renoprotective effects (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the proposed mechanism, the expected effect of tranilast in a CKD context is to attenuate tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis by mitigating both inflammatory and fibrotic signaling. In tubular epithelial cells (TECs), oxidative stress triggers activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in IL-1β secretion and pyroptotic cell death—a process that not only damages the epithelial barrier but also leads to further recruitment of inflammatory cells. By interfering with the NLRP3–ASC and NLRP3–NEK7 interactions, tranilast is anticipated to reduce caspase-1 activation. Consequently, a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis is expected, which would alleviate tubular inflammation under conditions of oxidative stress (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).\n\nFurthermore, the reduction in IL-1β and subsequent dampening of the inflammatory cascade should also lead to a decrease in TGF-β release. TGF-β is critically involved in driving fibroblast activation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. Thus, by curtailing the initial inflammasome-mediated inflammatory trigger, tranilast indirectly reduces TGF-β levels, thereby preventing its downstream pro-fibrotic effects. This is particularly relevant in diabetic nephropathy and UUO models, where TGF-β-mediated fibrosis is a major determinant of disease progression (Chen et al., 2020; Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nIn summary, the expected outcome in an in vitro or in vivo CKD assay would be a demonstrable decrease in markers of inflammation (such as IL-1β levels), reduced caspase-1 activity, diminished pyroptosis (as measured by LDH release or similar assays), and lowered expression of fibrotic markers including collagen, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Moreover, the preservation of tubular epithelial cell integrity and a consequent improvement in overall kidney function would provide functional support for tranilast’s therapeutic efficacy in CKD (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nTranilast represents a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease based on its dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. From a mechanistic standpoint, its ability to selectively disrupt the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting key protein–protein interactions (specifically between NLRP3, ASC, and NEK7) underpins its potential to reduce caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. This targeted mechanism is particularly attractive because it distinguishes tranilast from broader-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs that may have off-target effects. Moreover, by concurrently attenuating TGF-β signaling pathways, tranilast can reduce fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition—both critical contributors to the progression of CKD (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019).\n\nA major strength of tranilast is its established clinical use as an anti-allergic agent over several decades, which provides a substantial record of safety and tolerability in humans. Its oral dosing regimen further facilitates rapid clinical repurposing for CKD. Preclinical studies in animal models of diabetic nephropathy and UUO have demonstrated measurable benefits, such as reduced proteinuria and improved renal histology, lending support to its potential efficacy in human CKD (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nHowever, there are certain weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Despite promising preclinical data, there is a noted absence of registered clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with tranilast (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), which indicates that further clinical validation is required. Moreover, while tranilast’s inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is supported by various mechanistic studies, the precise molecular details—such as confirmation of binding to the LRR domain of NLRP3 and the exact nature of its impact on NEK7 interactions—require further elucidation through biochemical and structural studies (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). In addition, as with any repurposed drug, careful evaluation of potential off-target immunomodulatory effects is necessary. There have been reports of immune-mediated adverse events in other clinical indications, which, although not prominent, must be monitored during chronic administration in CKD patients (Strilchuk et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, the body of preclinical literature strongly supports the hypothesis that tranilast can disrupt NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and attenuate subsequent inflammatory and fibrotic cascades in the kidney. Given its dual mechanism—inhibiting both inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion and TGF-β–mediated fibrosis—tranilast emerges as an attractive candidate for repurposing in CKD. Its established use in other indications and favorable oral bioavailability further underscore its potential for rapid clinical translation. Nonetheless, the lack of direct clinical trial evidence in renal disease and the need for further mechanistic clarification represent critical challenges that the research team must address in subsequent studies (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023). Overall, the strengths of mechanistic specificity and a well-established safety profile position tranilast as a promising drug candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease, warranting further investigation through comprehensive preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials.\n\nReferences  \nChen, S., Wang, Y., Pan, Y., Liu, Y., Zheng, S., Ding, K., Mu, K., Yuan, Y., Li, Z., Song, H., Jin, Y., & Fu, J.

It belongs to the class of caspase-1 inhibitors, which are designed to target the proteolytic enzyme caspase‐1 responsible for the post-translational processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Originally discovered through efforts to identify small molecules that could modulate inflammasome-mediated inflammation, VX-765 was synthesized to covalently interact with the catalytic cysteine residue of caspase‐1 and thereby block its activity. This group of compounds is part of a broader category of anti-inflammatory agents that have been applied in conditions where excessive inflammasome activation leads to tissue damage, and they have been used in clinical studies for disorders such as epilepsy and psoriasis, demonstrating that this drug class can effectively modulate immune signaling pathways and cytokine maturation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nVX-765 has an established history in preclinical and early clinical research. It has advanced into Phase II trials in both epilepsy and psoriasis, conditions associated with chronic inflammation and abnormal cytokine signaling, thereby establishing a safety profile and demonstrating adequate target engagement in humans. Although it has not been widely evaluated in clinical trials specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), preclinical studies conducted in rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) have demonstrated that VX-765 effectively reduces markers of inflammation such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), diminishes macrophage infiltration, and reduces collagen deposition, which are indicative of reduced fibrotic remodeling in the kidney (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024). Additionally, the general class of caspase-1 inhibitors has been successfully applied in various inflammatory conditions, and mechanistic studies suggest that inhibiting caspase-1 can interrupt the cascade leading to pyroptotic cell death—a key factor in inflammatory tissue damage. Although there is no large-scale clinical trial data in CKD to date, the compound’s mechanism, coupled with existing human safety data from other indications, strongly supports its rapid repurposing potential for kidney diseases (Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nVX-765’s mechanism of action is centered on the selective inhibition of caspase-1, an essential enzyme involved in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, and in mediating a form of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that VX-765 is a prodrug that is metabolized into VRT-043198, which binds irreversibly to the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys285) in the active site of caspase-1 through covalent interactions. Structural analyses, including crystallography experiments, have elucidated that VRT-043198 makes additional hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with key residues (e.g., R179, Q283, P343, and R383) ensuring a high degree of selectivity for inflammatory caspases over apoptotic caspases (Yang, 2019). By blocking caspase-1, VX-765 prevents the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active cytokine forms, thereby reducing the release of these potent inflammatory mediators; it also prevents the cleavage of gasdermin D, a critical effector protein required to form membrane pores that mediate pyroptotic cell death. In renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and other cell types implicated in kidney disease, such proclivity for pyroptosis can drive local inflammatory cascades and fibrotic signaling, so inhibiting caspase-1 may mitigate these processes (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). The specificity of VX-765 for caspase-1 has been confirmed through both in vitro assays—with assessments of IL-1β release and gasdermin D cleavage—and in vivo models where administration of VX-765 led to reduced serum IL-1β, improved survival in sepsis models, and attenuation of inflammatory tissue injury (Yang, 2019; Liu et al., 2023).\n\nExpected Effect in Chronic Kidney Disease:  \nIn the context of Chronic Kidney Disease, particularly conditions characterized by diabetic nephropathy and renal fibrosis, the hypothesis is that VX-765 will reduce caspase-1 mediated pyroptosis and subsequent inflammatory cytokine release in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). TEC pyroptosis contributes to tubular cell death and triggers a deleterious inflammatory milieu that ultimately drives fibrotic remodeling through the activation of myofibroblasts and increased deposition of extracellular matrix components such as collagen. VX-765 is expected to block this cascade at an early step by preventing the activation of caspase-1, thereby limiting IL-1β and IL-18 maturation and secretion. This, in turn, should reduce the recruitment and activation of inflammatory macrophages—a process that has been shown to contribute to fibrogenesis in the kidney (Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Preclinical evidence from rodent models supports that administration of VX-765 leads to decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced expression of pro-fibrotic markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and a lower deposition of collagen, thereby preserving renal tubular structure and function. Considering caspase-1 and the inflammasome complex are expressed in renal cells including TECs and resident macrophages, targeting caspase-1 is a rational approach to interrupt the feedback loop between cell death and inflammation that exacerbates CKD progression (Zhou & Li, 2023; Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of VX-765 as a therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease include its well-defined mechanism of action, oral bioavailability, and the fact that it has already undergone Phase II clinical trials in other indications, demonstrating an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in humans. The mechanistic rationale is strong: by targeting caspase-1, VX-765 interrupts the inflammasome-driven cascade responsible for both pyroptotic cell death and the maturation of key pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in renal fibrosis. Preclinical models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction have provided promising evidence that caspase-1 inhibition can reduce renal inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and extracellular matrix deposition, suggesting that VX-765 might slow the progression of fibrotic changes in CKD (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). Furthermore, targeting a central mediator such as caspase-1 may have broader benefits by influencing several downstream inflammatory pathways simultaneously, thus potentially overcoming the limitations of therapies that target individual cytokines.  \nWeaknesses include the translational gap that currently exists between preclinical efficacy in rodent models and clinical benefit in human CKD patients. Although VX-765 has demonstrated safety in epilepsy and psoriasis trials, the long-term effects of inhibiting caspase-1 in a chronic disease setting like CKD are not fully understood, particularly given the complex roles that inflammasome signaling may play in tissue repair, host defense, and kidney homeostasis. There is also the possibility that fully inhibiting caspase-1 could lead to compensatory activation of alternative inflammatory pathways or unintended off-target effects, especially in patients with compromised kidney function. Additionally, while preclinical data are encouraging, there is a need for dedicated clinical trials in CKD and related fibrotic conditions to establish the optimal dosing, efficacy, and safety profile in this specific patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).  \nOverall, VX-765 exhibits several promising attributes as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for CKD: its defined molecular target, demonstrated anti-inflammatory mechanism through caspase-1 inhibition, and supportive preclinical evidence of renoprotection provide a compelling rationale for further investigation. The strengths of existing human safety data and oral administration combine with a robust mechanistic framework to justify advancing VX-765 into clinical trials in patients with CKD. Nonetheless, further research is required to clarify long-term effects on renal function, potential compensatory inflammatory mechanisms, and the detailed pharmacodynamics in the setting of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. With carefully designed clinical studies focusing on renal endpoints, VX-765 could represent a valuable addition to the therapeutic arsenal against CKD, particularly for patients whose disease is driven significantly by inflammasome-mediated inflammation and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

The compound was synthesized via a chemically directed approach—in particular, its synthesis involved an alkylation reaction of sodium methanesulfinate with 3-bromopropionitrile, yielding a β-sulfonyl nitrile moiety that confers its inhibitory activity (Marchetti et al., 2018). This class of small molecule inhibitors has been widely explored for targeting inflammatory pathways through modulation of innate immune responses. Historically, β-sulfonyl nitrile compounds have attracted attention as therapeutic agents due to their capacity to engage key protein domains involved in inflammation while maintaining selectivity and oral bioavailability, attributes that are critical for chronic treatment regimens (Marchetti et al., 2018).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOLT1177 has progressed through several stages of development and clinical evaluation in diseases characterized by uncontrolled inflammation, notably in acute gout flares, heart failure, and conditions linked to cytokine release syndromes. In Phase I clinical trials, dapansutrile demonstrated an excellent safety profile when administered to healthy subjects at dosages up to 1000 mg per day for 8 days, thereby establishing its tolerability and preliminary evidence of target engagement (Jansen et al., 2019). Moreover, therapeutic evaluations in inflammatory settings—such as a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study in patients with NYHA II–III systolic heart failure—further underscored its favorable safety profile and pharmacodynamic effects despite the fact that current clinical investigations have not directly targeted Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) populations (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical studies in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy have demonstrated that treatment with OLT1177 leads to significant reductions in renal IL-1β levels, decreased macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis, suggesting that its benefits extend to kidney-related inflammatory damage (Mulay, 2019). Although clinical trials specifically focused on CKD or renal inflammation are lacking at this point, the robust anti-inflammatory effects observed in related models and conditions provide a sound rationale for repurposing OLT1177 in chronic kidney disease.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, OLT1177 selectively inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by targeting its central NACHT domain, where it interferes with ATPase activity that is critical for the oligomerization process necessary for inflammasome assembly. Under normal conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggers the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), leading to the formation of a multi-protein complex that activates caspase-1 and drives the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) (Kim et al., 2019). OLT1177 binds specifically to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, thereby blocking the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC, which is a necessary event for full inflammasome assembly (Marchetti et al., 2018). In doing so, it prevents the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-1 and effectively reduces the secretion of IL-1β. This mechanism is particularly significant in environments of hyperglycemic stress, where increased NLRP3 activity in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) drives inflammation, pyroptotic cell death, and subsequent tubulointerstitial fibrosis (Mulay, 2019). Additionally, by curtailing downstream cytokine release and pyroptosis, OLT1177 is believed to mitigate the metabolic cost of inflammation, an effect that has been observed in multiple preclinical in vivo studies in conditions ranging from acute arthritis to cardiac dysfunction (Jansen et al., 2019; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe central hypothesis is that through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, OLT1177 will effectively block the recruitment of ASC and disrupt subsequent caspase-1 activation in renal tubular cells, particularly under conditions of hyperglycemia which are common in diabetic nephropathy. Under hyperglycemic stress, renal tubular epithelial cells exhibit increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and aberrant inflammasome activation resulting in heightened secretion of IL-1β, a cytokine implicated in promoting fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition. By preventing the cleavage of pro-IL-1β into its active form, OLT1177 is expected to prevent pyroptotic cell death of TECs and interrupt the deleterious cycle of inflammation-driven fibrogenesis in the kidney (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Evidence from animal models indicates that selective blockade of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to a marked decrease in renal inflammation as evidenced by reduced macrophage infiltration and lower profibrotic cytokine levels, which supports the expectation that OLT1177 could yield appreciable renoprotective outcomes in CKD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In the proposed assay, it is anticipated that OLT1177 will reduce markers of inflammation such as IL-1β and IL-18 in the culture medium of hyperglycemia-stressed TECs, thereby correlating with decreased pyroptosis and improved cell viability. This would be further corroborated by downstream effects such as reduced activation of profibrotic pathways, including lower TGF-β signaling and diminished deposition of fibrotic markers, ultimately mitigating the progression toward renal fibrosis (Cliff, 2023; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate with substantial potential for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease owing to its well-characterized mechanism of action, favorable preclinical results, and established safety profile in early clinical studies. One of the major strengths of OLT1177 lies in its selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an attractive target given the critical role of NLRP3 in mediating renal inflammation, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenesis. Its synthetic origins and robust medicinal chemistry underpin its precise targeting of the NACHT domain in NLRP3, effectively sparing other inflammasomes and reducing the risk of broad immunosuppression (Marchetti et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Furthermore, its oral bioavailability and metabolic stability make it suitable for chronic administration, an essential consideration for CKD where long-term therapy is required (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nFrom a therapeutic history perspective, although OLT1177 has not yet been directly tested in human CKD patient populations, its successful progression through Phase I trials for conditions such as gout and heart failure, combined with promising data in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy, strongly supports its potential utility in renal settings (Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Preclinical studies show reduced renal IL-1β secretion, diminished macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis when NLRP3 is inhibited by agents like OLT1177, lending biological credence to the hypothesis that inflammasome inhibition could slow CKD progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nAt the molecular level, the precise action of OLT1177—binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ASC recruitment—represents a highly targeted approach that contrasts with cytokine-neutralizing therapies such as anti-IL-1β antibodies. This specificity is advantageous because it not only prevents the generation of IL-1β but also curtails the activation of NFκB and other downstream inflammatory cascades, potentially reducing off-target effects and preserving broader immune competence (Marchetti et al., 2018; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020). Additionally, the expected anti-inflammatory effects in renal tubular cells—specifically preventing pyroptosis and fibrogenesis—are consistent with literature demonstrating that NLRP3 is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells under hyperglycemic and inflammatory stress (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain. One of the limitations stems from the current lack of direct clinical evidence in CKD populations; while animal models provide a strong rationale, the translation of these findings into human CKD may be complicated by the multifactorial nature of the disease, where multiple pathways contribute to renal injury beyond inflammasome activation. Additionally, the chronic nature of CKD necessitates prolonged administration of therapeutic agents, and long-term safety data for OLT1177 in such a setting are still pending. There is also the possibility that inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome might impair necessary innate immune responses, although the specificity of OLT1177 for the NLRP3 complex—in contrast to more generalized anti-inflammatory agents—should, in theory, mitigate this concern (Seok et al., 2021).\n\nMoreover, while the preclinical data in models of diabetic nephropathy and crystal-induced kidney injury are promising, variability in genetic and environmental factors in human CKD could affect the compound’s efficacy. It will therefore be critical to design dedicated clinical trials in defined CKD populations, ideally incorporating biomarkers of inflammasome activity, such as circulating IL-1β and IL-18 levels, as well as imaging and functional assessments of renal fibrosis and function. The anti-fibrotic effects, in particular, warrant closer mechanistic studies to confirm that inhibition of TEC pyroptosis and preservation of tubular integrity occur in the human kidney as they do in animal models (Williams et al., 2022; Cliff, 2023).\n\nIn conclusion, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) represents a compelling candidate for repurposing in Chronic Kidney Disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, favorable pharmacological profile, and preclinical evidence supporting its renoprotective effects. Its ability to directly inhibit the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding to the NACHT domain and blocking ASC recruitment addresses a critical upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that leads to caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and subsequent pyroptosis of renal tubular cells. This mode of action has the potential to attenuate the inflammation-driven fibrogenesis that is central to CKD progression, particularly in diabetic nephropathy where hyperglycemic stress is a key driver of renal injury.\n\nStrengths of OLT1177 include its synthetic origin allowing for structural optimization, its demonstrated safety in Phase I clinical trials, its oral bioavailability which is advantageous for chronic therapy, and its selective inhibitory action that minimizes off-target effects. Additionally, existing preclinical studies showing reduced renal IL-1β, diminished macrophage infiltration, and lowered fibrotic responses in models of nephropathy provide a promising foundation for further exploration in CKD (Mulay, 2019; Jansen et al., 2019).\n\nWeaknesses or challenges include the current absence of dedicated clinical trials in CKD, the complexity of CKD pathophysiology where multiple inflammatory and fibrotic pathways are involved, and the potential risk that chronic inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome could in some contexts compromise the host defense or alter essential cellular processes. These concerns underscore the need for carefully designed preclinical studies specifically in renal disease models, followed by early phase clinical trials in well-defined CKD populations to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and long-term safety.\n\nOverall, based on the comprehensive literature review, the mechanistic rationale, and the encouraging preclinical and early clinical data available, OLT1177 shows significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease. The next steps should involve further detailed studies in CKD-specific preclinical models that assess not only inflammatory cytokine modulation but also functional outcomes such as glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria reduction, and fibrosis attenuation. A robust clinical development program targeting patients with diabetic nephropathy and other forms of CKD characterized by inflammasome activation would be the logical progression to validate its clinical utility (Marchetti et al., 2018; Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nReferences  \nCliff, C.

"(Brilliant Blue G, 1)","(Disulfiram, 0)","Both candidates target inflammatory cell death pathways implicated in CKD progression, but they differ substantially in existing CKD‐relevant data, mechanism directness, safety background in chronic dosing, and translational readiness. Disulfiram (Candidate 0) is a covalent inhibitor of GSDMD, directly blocking pyroptosis at the terminal pore‐forming step. It boasts decades of human safety data in alcohol aversion, clear MoA in inflammasome‐driven models, and promising efficacy in acute kidney injury (AKI) via caspase‐11–GSDMD inhibition. However, its CKD‐specific evidence is limited to acute or non‐renal inflammatory models. No chronic kidney fibrosis or long‐term efficacy data exist, and systemic GSDMD inhibition raises immunosuppression concerns. Dosing for sustained GSDMD blockade in renal tissue is untested, and off‐target thiol reactivity may provoke unanticipated toxicities in a long‐term setting. Brilliant Blue G (BBG, Candidate 1) is a noncompetitive P2X7 antagonist with multiple rodent CKD models (UUO, hypertensive nephropathy), demonstrating reduced IL-1β, macrophage infiltration, interstitial fibrosis, and improved tubular regeneration. Its MoA interrupts upstream ATP signaling to NLRP3, offering dual benefits on inflammasome priming and pyroptosis. While BBG lacks direct human CKD trials, related P2X7/NLRP3 inhibitors are in clinical development, and BBG’s surgical and CNS usage suggest a clean acute safety profile. Key risks include incomplete blockade of inflammasome redundancy and potential effects on vascular tone. Yet its preclinical CKD evidence, defined target, and translational momentum outweigh Disulfiram’s more limited CKD focus.","BBG outperforms Disulfiram primarily on the strength and direct relevance of CKD preclinical data (rodent UUO and hypertensive nephropathy models vs only AKI models), greater mechanistic clarity in a CKD context (P2X7‐NLRP3 upstream blockade) and solid translational path via related clinical efforts. Disulfiram, despite a well‐known safety profile and a novel direct GSDMD mechanism, lacks chronic fibrosis models and carries higher uncertainty around chronic dosing, off‐target effects, and immune compromise. Therefore, BBG presents a more de‐risked, evidence‐backed candidate for CKD translation.",18,"(0, 1)","{'hypothesis': 'Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nDisulfiram is a synthetic small‐molecule drug originally discovered more than seventy years ago and is well known for its unique chemical structure featuring a tetraethylthiuram disulfide core. It is typically synthesized via the oxidation of diethyldithiocarbamate salts derived from the reaction of carbon disulfide with diethylamine, producing a compound with a central disulfide bond that confers its thiol‐reactive properties (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13). Chemically, disulfiram belongs to the dithiocarbamate family and is classified pharmacologically as an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor. Historically, this inhibition of ALDH has been the molecular basis for its clinical application as an alcohol aversion agent, where disulfiram induces the accumulation of acetaldehyde following alcohol ingestion, causing an assortment of discomforting physiological effects such as flushing, nausea, and tachycardia (Lu et al., 2021, p. 12). More recently, however, disulfiram has assumed a new identity in drug repurposing initiatives; its ability to interact covalently with cysteine residues in target proteins – a consequence of its thiuram disulfide structure – has attracted considerable attention in the context of inflammatory diseases. In particular, its capacity to interfere with the function of gasdermin D (GSDMD) via covalent modification is emerging as a promising mechanism by which disulfiram could counteract pathological inflammatory pathways (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4). This newly recognized activity places disulfiram within a therapeutic class of established drugs that are being re‐evaluated beyond their original indications, seeking to exploit their long clinical history and known safety profiles for novel applications such as the modulation of pyroptosis in inflammatory pathologies like chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nDisulfiram has a long-established history, primarily being used in the management of chronic alcohol use disorder since its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the early 1950s. As a stand‐alone therapy, its effectiveness in producing a pronounced aversive reaction to ethanol intake has made it a mainstay in addiction medicine. Over the decades, disulfiram has been administered safely to vast numbers of patients – a fact that is of critical importance when considering repurposing efforts, as its pharmacokinetics, dosing parameters, and toxicity profiles are well documented (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3). In addition to its established role in alcohol abstinence, disulfiram has been repurposed for a number of other applications. Emerging investigations have highlighted its promising activity in malignancies, where disulfiram, often in conjunction with supplemental copper, has demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against cancer stem cells via mechanisms that involve proteasome inhibition and modulation of redox homeostasis (Lu et al., 2021, pp. 13–14; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). More recently, its anti-inflammatory potential has been explored in the context of infectious diseases and systemic inflammatory responses. For instance, disulfiram has been evaluated in sepsis models, where its inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis led to reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines and improved survival in animal models (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). In models of ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), disulfiram pretreatment was shown to ameliorate renal dysfunction and histological damage by suppressing the noncanonical caspase-11–GSDMD inflammatory axis (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6). Although direct clinical studies of disulfiram in chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis remain limited, the encouraging preclinical signals from acute kidney insults and its capacity to modulate cell death pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation suggest that disulfiram—and its metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate—might be effective in attenuating the injurious inflammatory cascades observed in CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, the repurposing hypothesis for disulfiram in chronic kidney disease centers on its recently identified inhibitory effect on gasdermin D (GSDMD), a pore-forming effector protein that is indispensable for the execution of pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory, lytic form of programmed cell death triggered by the activation of inflammasomes. When these multiprotein complexes form in response to pathogenic stimuli or sterile injury, they lead to the activation of inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1, and in noncanonical pathways, caspase-4/5/11. These enzymes cleave GSDMD to generate an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) that oligomerizes and inserts into the plasma membrane to form pores, thereby releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) into the extracellular milieu (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17). Disulfiram has been shown to block this crucial terminal step in pyroptosis by covalently modifying a conserved cysteine residue (Cys191 in human GSDMD and Cys192 in murine GSDMD) through a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. This chemical modification prevents the oligomerization and subsequent membrane pore formation by GSDMD, thereby directly inhibiting the execution phase of pyroptosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). Moreover, disulfiram’s activity is potentiated in the presence of copper ions, which may stabilize its reactive metabolites such as diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC), enhancing its inhibitory potency in cellular assays (Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18). The outcome of this inhibition is a significant reduction in the pyroptotic cell death cascade, as evidenced by decreased IL-1β release and overall attenuation of inflammatory signaling. In the context of the kidney, specifically within tubular epithelial cells (TECs), the inflammatory microenvironment driven by inflammasome activation is one of the critical factors in the progression from acute injury to chronic fibrosis. TECs are known to express inflammasome components and are susceptible to pyroptosis, which contributes to interstitial inflammation and fibrogenesis (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Therefore, by inhibiting the cleavage and activation of GSDMD in these cells, disulfiram has the potential to preserve tubular integrity and prevent the inflammatory cascade that ultimately drives chronic kidney injury.\n\nExpected Effect:  \nBased on the proposed hypothesis and data from related inflammatory and renal injury models, disulfiram is predicted to exert a protective effect in the setting of chronic kidney disease by targeting the final common pathway of pyroptotic cell death. In a typical in vitro assay using primary tubular epithelial cells or established TEC lines, treatment with disulfiram at concentrations within the non-cytotoxic range (e.g., 0.1–5 µM as indicated in hypoxia/reoxygenation models) is expected to prevent the formation of GSDMD pores, thereby reducing cell membrane disruption, limiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18), and preserving cell viability (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11). The expected molecular signature following disulfiram treatment would include decreased levels of cleaved (active) GSDMD, reduced caspase-11 activation along with lower concentrations of circulating cytokines, as well as preserved markers of epithelial cell integrity. Given that GSDMD and components of the inflammasome are expressed in tubular epithelial cells (as supported by studies focusing on renal inflammatory pathways; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 7–9; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 9–10), the inhibition of GSDMD pore formation directly addresses a mechanistic driver of tubular injury. This would translate into reduced interstitial inflammation and limited myofibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition, which are critical steps in the fibrotic process that underpins CKD progression (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Ultimately, the expectation is that a therapeutic regimen involving disulfiram may slow or even halt the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease by mitigating the damaging effects of pyroptosis.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nDisulfiram presents several attractive features as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. The strengths of disulfiram include:  \n1. A well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profile, supported by decades of clinical use in alcohol aversion therapy, which facilitates rapid translation into new clinical contexts (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Lu et al., 2021, p. 12).  \n2. A clear and innovative mechanism of action based on the inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis. This mechanism is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of CKD, where inflammasome activation and resultant pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells contribute to interstitial inflammation and fibrosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11).  \n3. The potential for its active metabolite, diethyldithiocarbamate, and the enhancing role of copper complexation to improve its potency as a pyroptosis inhibitor further bolster the therapeutic rationale (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18; Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34).  \n4. Preclinical evidence in models of acute kidney injury (ischemia-reperfusion injury) demonstrates that disulfiram can ameliorate renal dysfunction through inhibition of the caspase-11–GSDMD axis, suggesting that similar effects may be achieved in chronic inflammatory settings underlying CKD (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11).  \n\nHowever, there are also potential weaknesses and gaps that warrant further exploration:  \n1. Despite promising preclinical data in acute injury models and other inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, direct evidence of disulfiram’s efficacy in chronic kidney disease models remains limited. The available studies do not present long-term data specific to CKD or renal fibrosis, which is critical for validating its use in a chronic condition (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6).  \n2. While the mechanism of covalent modification of GSDMD at Cys191 is well supported by molecular studies, the extrapolation of these findings to tubular epithelial cells in the kidney (as opposed to macrophages or other inflammatory cells) requires additional confirmation. It is essential to verify that TECs exhibit similar susceptibility to the gasdermin D inhibitory effects of disulfiram under pathological conditions (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n3. Dosage optimization, chronic toxicity assessments, and potential off-target effects in the renal context have not yet been extensively characterized. Although the historical human use of disulfiram supports a favorable safety profile, the dosing regimen for CKD might differ from that used for alcohol aversion therapy, given the distinct pharmacodynamics required to inhibit pyroptosis in kidney tissues (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8).  \n4. Another consideration is the effect of systemic modulation of pyroptosis. Since pyroptosis is integral to effective immune responses under certain circumstances, indiscriminate long-term inhibition could potentially compromise host defenses against infections. This balance between therapeutic efficacy in CKD and preservation of necessary immune functions must be carefully evaluated in preclinical models and eventually in clinical trials (Hu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n\nIn summary, disulfiram emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease due to its novel mechanism of targeting gasdermin D-induced pyroptosis—a pathway that is increasingly recognized as a critical driver of renal inflammation and fibrogenesis. Its long clinical history, established oral bioavailability, and well-characterized safety profile offer substantial advantages that could accelerate its translation into CKD-focused studies. The evidence from acute kidney injury models and inflammatory disease research forms a strong mechanistic rationale for its use to preserve tubular epithelial integrity and mitigate interstitial inflammation. Nevertheless, further detailed studies are imperative to validate its effectiveness in chronic kidney models, delineate optimal dosing strategies, and ensure that the inhibition of pyroptosis does not adversely affect normal immune surveillance. Based on the data reviewed—from biochemical studies demonstrating covalent modification of GSDMD (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8) to preclinical studies in renal injury models (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6)—the overall evaluation supports continued investigation of disulfiram as a repurposed agent in CKD. Its potential to modulate a critical pathogenic pathway in chronic kidney injury could represent a novel therapeutic intervention that merits further preclinical and clinical development (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18).\n\nReferences  \nCai, Q., Sun, Z., Xu, S., Jiao, X., Guo, S., Li, Y., Wu, H., & Yu, X.

BBG is part of the broad class of blue dyes that have been extensively studied for their ability to interact with the purinergic receptor family, most notably acting as a non‐competitive antagonist of the P2X7 receptor. The compound’s chemical structure confers high water solubility and the ability to be administered at defined doses with a favorable safety profile, as demonstrated by its routine use in ophthalmic surgery and CNS studies without systemic toxicity. In its role as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, BBG has been used in various preclinical studies investigating inflammatory and cell death pathways. Its synthetic origin and established manufacturing process, as offered by suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #B0770), support its scalability for repurposing in chronic diseases. BBG belongs to a class of small molecules that modulate ion channel function, particularly by binding to the ATP‐activated P2X7 receptor, which has been implicated in various inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. This class of compounds has been employed not only for their staining properties but also for their ability to interfere with cellular signaling events related to inflammation, rendering them of considerable interest in conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD) where inflammation and fibrosis are critical pathogenic factors (Ferreira et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nHistorically, Brilliant Blue G has been most widely recognized as a histological staining agent with established safety in both preclinical and clinical contexts, particularly within the neuroprotective field. Its pharmacological actions extend to antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, and preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in animal models of inflammatory diseases, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and various neurodegenerative conditions. More recently, BBG has been evaluated in rodent models of kidney disease. For example, in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) models—a widely used experimental model that mimics tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis—BBG treatment has been observed to reduce inflammation, diminish interstitial fibrosis, and promote tubular cell regeneration (Pereira et al., 2020). In rodent hypertensive nephropathy models, BBG has also been reported to modulate renal vascular resistance and alter tubular injury markers, suggesting that its renoprotective effects might extend to a broader spectrum of CKD–related pathologies. Although clinical trials directly targeting chronic kidney disease with BBG have not yet been detailed in the public literature, searches in ClinicalTrials.gov using terms related to “Brilliant Blue G OR P2X7 antagonist OR P2X7 inhibitor OR NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have identified several ongoing studies investigating similar P2X7 blockade strategies in CKD, which support the translational potential of this approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Prior investigations in animal models of lupus nephritis and hypertensive kidney disease have indicated that BBG’s anti‐inflammatory profile, including decreased IL-1β levels and reduced macrophage infiltration, is conducive to preventing progressive renal damage (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020). Veterinary and preclinical applications in models of inflammatory injury provide a solid foundation for repurposing BBG as a potential therapeutic candidate in conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, such as CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe mechanism by which BBG is hypothesized to exert its renoprotective effects in CKD is centered on its ability to non‐competitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor present on both renal immune and epithelial cells. The P2X7 receptor is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated cation channel that is activated under pathophysiological conditions where extracellular ATP levels are elevated, which frequently occurs during tissue injury and inflammation. Once activated, the P2X7 receptor facilitates the formation of pores in the plasma membrane that allow for the influx of cations and the efflux of cellular contents, thereby precipitating a cascade of intracellular events. One critical downstream consequence of P2X7 activation is the priming and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that, upon activation, recruits the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and pro-caspase-1. This assembly leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase-1, which in turn processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, resulting in their secretion and the amplification of the inflammatory response. Moreover, P2X7 activation can induce pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that further exacerbates tissue injury and inflammation (Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nBBG exerts its effects via a noncompetitive blockade of the P2X7 receptor. In doing so, BBG prevents ATP-induced ion channel opening, thereby blocking the subsequent calcium influx and pore formation that are necessary for downstream inflammasome priming. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that BBG inhibits P2X7 receptor-mediated responses, including the calcium influx and the release of IL-1β from macrophages and other immune cells. In vitro studies with BBG have revealed nanomolar potency in blocking P2X7-mediated activities, which is reflective of its efficacy in dampening the inflammasome-related cytokine cascades (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019). Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that BBG may also interfere with pannexin-1 channels that are thought to facilitate ATP release and further promote inflammasome activation, although the precise relationship between pannexin-1 and P2X7 remains the subject of active research (Ferreira et al., 2016). Consequently, by inhibiting the P2X7 receptor, BBG blocks the ATP-driven initiation of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade. This blockade limits caspase-1 activation and the subsequent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, ultimately reducing local inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrotic remodeling within the renal parenchyma. Evidence from animal models indicates that such inhibition leads to reduced macrophage infiltration, decreased fibrogenic markers, and enhanced tubular cell regeneration, which collectively preserve the integrity of the tubulointerstitial architecture (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the established mechanistic pathway, BBG is expected to exert multifaceted renoprotective effects when applied to models of chronic kidney disease. In the proposed assay evaluating drug effects on renal cells, the expected outcome would involve a significant reduction in ATP-induced inflammasome activation. Specifically, by antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, BBG should lower the levels of active caspase-1, thereby reducing the maturation and extracellular release of IL-1β. This attenuation of inflammasome activation is expected to diminish pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells and mitigate pro-inflammatory cytokine release from resident macrophages. BBG’s inhibition of these pathways would theoretically preserve tubular architecture and limit interstitial fibrosis—a hallmark of progressive CKD. The renoprotective effect is anticipated to be observed as decreased expression of fibrosis markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and heat shock protein-47 (HSP47), as well as reduced collagen deposition, as evidenced in rodent models of UUO and hypertensive nephropathy (Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nAt the molecular level, renal epithelial cells, particularly proximal tubular cells, express both P2X7 receptors and components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Immunohistochemical studies in animal models have demonstrated that under pathological conditions, P2X7 receptor expression is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells and can lead to enhanced production of IL-1β when activated by extracellular ATP (Arulkumaran, 2016; Howarth, 2020). Therefore, BBG is expected to be especially effective in cell types that are critical in the development of inflammation and fibrosis in CKD. By reducing the number of inflammatory cells (such as CD68-positive macrophages) infiltrating the renal parenchyma and by limiting cell death via pyroptosis, BBG may also indirectly reduce the fibrotic signaling that is mediated by cytokines such as TGF-β. This dual effect—both direct inhibition of inflammatory signaling and preservation of renal cell integrity—provides a compelling rationale for BBG’s use in preventing the progression of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nMoreover, BBG’s known safety profile in central nervous system studies and its extensive use as a surgical dye underscore its translational potential. Its water solubility and known pharmacokinetics facilitate dosing strategies that could be adapted for chronic administration in CKD patients. Additionally, the indirect suppression of inflammasome activation through P2X7 antagonism presents a novel approach to modulating the inflammatory microenvironment in the kidney, one that targets a critical nexus of inflammation and fibrosis (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, BBG presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on its ability to noncompetitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor, thereby blocking ATP-induced inflammasome priming and activation. The strengths of BBG include its well-established safety profile, water solubility, and proven efficacy in various rodent models of kidney injury such as hypertensive nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction. Preclinical data indicate that BBG can reduce key mediators of inflammation such as IL-1β, lower caspase-1 activation, and mitigate the deleterious effects of pyroptosis on renal tubular architecture, all of which are central to the pathophysiology of CKD (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain that warrant further investigation. There is limited direct clinical data specifically evaluating BBG in human CKD patients, although the identification of related clinical trials targeting P2X7 and NLRP3 receptors in CKD suggests active interest in this therapeutic approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while BBG’s mechanism of action is well supported by in vitro and animal studies, the potential for differential effects based on receptor splice variants and cell type specificity in renal tissue must be carefully delineated. For instance, recent studies indicate that variations in P2X7 receptor expression and function in the renal vasculature may impact not only inflammatory signaling but also vascular tone, which could influence overall renal perfusion and function (Howarth, 2020).\n\nMoreover, while BBG’s indirect inhibition of the inflammasome pathway via P2X7 antagonism is mechanistically attractive, redundancy in inflammasome activation pathways—such as those that are P2X7-independent—might limit the overall efficacy of BBG as a monotherapy. Some studies have demonstrated that even with effective P2X7 inhibition, alternative pathways may still sustain IL-1β release under inflammatory conditions (Arulkumaran, 2016; Prendecki et al., 2022). Therefore, combination therapies that target multiple nodes in the inflammasome network may ultimately be required to achieve robust clinical benefit.\n\nIn terms of drug development strategies, BBG benefits from its established manufacturing and dosing data, which accelerates early phase clinical trial design and regulatory considerations. In addition, BBG has been successfully used in non-renal contexts—including long-term treatments in models of graft-versus-host disease—without significant toxicity, lending further support to its translational potential (Geraghty et al., 2019). The extensive literature on BBG’s anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in preclinical models provides a solid rationale for advancing this candidate for CKD even as further mechanistic and pharmacodynamic studies are conducted.\n\nWeaknesses of this candidate include the fact that while much of the preclinical data is encouraging, there is still a need for robust clinical trials that specifically assess BBG in CKD. Additionally, given the complexity of CKD pathogenesis—which involves multiple overlapping inflammatory and fibrotic signaling mechanisms—it will be important to determine whether BBG alone can induce sufficient therapeutic benefit or whether it is best applied as part of a combination regimen. Moreover, the potential vascular effects of P2X7 antagonism require further clarification to ensure that systemic hemodynamics are not adversely affected, particularly in patients with existing cardiovascular complications that often accompany CKD (Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall, the mechanistic rationale for BBG centers on its ability to interfere with a critical inflammatory pathway—namely, the ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. This blockade not only reduces the activation of caspase-1 and the release of IL-1β but also limits pyroptotic cell death, preservation of tubular architecture, and ultimately, fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. These effects address key pathogenic mechanisms underlying CKD progression. Moreover, aspects such as its water solubility, known dosing regimens from CNS and surgical applications, and favorable preclinical safety record render BBG an attractive candidate for fast-tracked repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Ferreira et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence reviewed indicates that Brilliant Blue G holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. Its mechanism—centered on noncompetitive antagonism of the P2X7 receptor and consequent suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade—offers a novel approach to preserving renal function by reducing inflammatory injury and fibrosis. While further research, particularly targeted clinical trials in the CKD patient population, is necessary to fully validate its efficacy and safety in this context, the preclinical data and extensive understanding of its molecular interactions support the continued development of BBG for CKD therapy (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nReferences  \nArulkumaran, N.

"(OLT1177, 8)","(CY-09, 7)","Both CY-09 and OLT1177 are selective small-molecule inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome targeting its NACHT domain, but they differ significantly in the strength of supporting evidence, translational maturity, and safety profile. CY-09 has been extensively characterized in vitro and in multiple rodent inflammatory models, showing nanomolar potency in macrophages and oral bioavailability in rodents. Its mechanism—binding the Walker A motif to block ATPase activity—is well-delineated and specific, with preclinical efficacy in models of sepsis, colitis, and metabolic inflammation. However, direct evidence in CKD models is lacking, and translational data in humans are absent. Off-target risks remain unprofiled outside of inflammasome components, and long-term safety in chronic dosing has not been established beyond rodents. OLT1177 (dapansutrile), by contrast, has a similar MoA—binding the NACHT domain to prevent ASC recruitment—and has demonstrated preclinical efficacy in crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy models. Critically, it has progressed through Phase I trials in healthy volunteers and early Phase II proof-of-concept in gout and heart failure, with an excellent safety and tolerability profile at doses up to 1000 mg/day. While CKD-specific clinical data are pending, OLT1177’s advanced translational status, human PK/PD data, and demonstration of renoprotective effects in relevant rodent CKD models substantially de-risk its development. Both compounds share strong mechanistic rationale, but the higher level of clinical evidence and established safety of OLT1177 tip the balance.","OLT1177 is the superior candidate because it combines a well-validated, specific mechanism of inhibiting NLRP3 with direct preclinical efficacy in kidney inflammation models and, crucially, has established safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy signals in humans. In contrast, CY-09, though mechanistically compelling and potent in rodents, lacks CKD-specific efficacy data and any clinical experience, making its translational risk higher. OLT1177’s advanced stage and human tolerability data make it the more promising candidate for rapid progression into CKD trials.",19,"(7, 8)","{'hypothesis': 'CY-09 (Selleckchem, catalog #S8614)', 'answer': 'Proposal for CY-09 (Selleckchem, catalog #S8614)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nCY-09 is a synthetic, small-molecule inhibitor discovered through a focused drug development campaign that initially screened analogs of CFTR inhibitors (specifically C172) and later optimized them to generate compounds with potent and selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Chemically, CY-09 belongs to the class of thiazolidinone derivatives, a category known for its capacity to interfere with enzymatic activities via covalent or non-covalent interactions. Its development was driven by the need to specifically target the ATP-binding site within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, particularly focusing on the Walker A motif—a conserved nucleotide-binding region that is essential for the ATPase activity required for NLRP3 oligomerization. The design rationale behind CY-09 was based on structure-based drug design principles, where the compound was engineered to directly bind NLRP3, thereby preventing the conformational changes necessary for inflammasome assembly. This chemical class has previously been used in various contexts to modulate protein–enzyme interactions, and its application in inflammasome biology represents an evolution of this approach to target excessive inflammation mediated by the innate immune system (Jiang et al., 2017; Bertinaria et al., 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of CY-09 is rooted in preclinical studies where it has been extensively characterized in vitro and in animal models of inflammatory diseases. Initially, CY-09 demonstrated potent inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in murine bone marrow–derived macrophages stimulated with canonical activators such as ATP, nigericin, and monosodium urate crystals, showing a dose-dependent reduction in IL-1β secretion and caspase-1 activation. Its efficacy has been documented in rodent models of sepsis and colitis, as well as in metabolic disorder models where NLRP3-driven inflammation is a core pathological feature. Although no clinical trials having been completed in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) specifically have been reported to date, the compound’s inclusion in multiple clinical trial searches (ClinicalTrials.gov) indicates that there is active interest in repurposing or further evaluating NLRP3 inhibitors like CY-09 in kidney-related conditions. Furthermore, the extensive body of work demonstrating that NLRP3 knockout or pharmacological inhibition confers protection against renal fibrosis, tubular inflammation, and other hallmarks of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Zhou & Li, 2023) supports the translational potential of a molecule such as CY-09. Historically, similar NLRP3 inhibitors (for example, MCC950) have been applied in various preclinical models of inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and their protective effects in conditions like diabetic nephropathy and ischemia-reperfusion injury provide a strong rationale for applying CY-09 in CKD (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nCY-09 exerts its therapeutic action by directly binding to the NLRP3 protein at its NACHT domain, specifically targeting the Walker A (or P-loop) motif responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis. This binding event competitively inhibits ATP from accessing the site, thereby blocking the ATPase activity essential for NLRP3 oligomerization. Without ATP hydrolysis, NLRP3 is unable to undergo the conformational rearrangements necessary for the aggregation of multiple NLRP3 molecules into the inflammasome complex. Consequently, the formation of the adaptor protein ASC specks is prevented, leading to a blockade of pro-caspase-1 activation and subsequent cleavage into its active form. This chain of events ultimately results in a reduction of the maturation and secretion of the central proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and it halts gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis—a form of lytic, inflammatory cell death that substantially contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis in CKD. Importantly, studies have demonstrated that CY-09 does not interfere with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, underscoring its molecular specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2019). The molecular interaction of CY-09 is supported by biotinylated pull-down assays which confirm its selective binding to NLRP3 over other inflammasome components, and computational docking models corroborate a binding mode that is competitive with ATP at the Walker A motif (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017). This detailed molecular mechanism signifies that CY-09 operates at an early and critical step in the inflammasome pathway, making it a highly attractive candidate for diseases with a significant inflammatory component, such as CKD (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe proposed hypothesis for applying CY-09 to CKD is that by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in human proximal tubular epithelial cells, the compound will inhibit ATPase-driven oligomerization of NLRP3, thereby reducing the formation of ASC specks, the activation of caspase-1, and the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. The downstream effect of blocking these events is the inhibition of gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis, which is known to drive tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrotic remodeling—a central hallmark in the progression of CKD. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, NLRP3 is expressed and activated in response to various stress stimuli, including oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and metabolic dysregulation, all of which are common in CKD pathogenesis. By impeding this pathway, CY-09 is expected to diminish inflammatory cytokine secretion and reduce cell death, thereby preserving tubular integrity, minimizing interstitial inflammation, and preventing the fibrotic changes that culminate in renal function decline (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Data from preclinical models of kidney injury, such as those using MCC950 and other NLRP3 knockout models, have consistently shown improvements in renal structure and function, and reduction in profibrotic markers upon inhibition of the NLRP3 pathway (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017). Furthermore, oral bioavailability and a favorable safety profile in rodent studies enhance the clinical feasibility of CY-09 as a repurposed agent for CKD (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The expected effects in a CKD model would therefore include reduced extracellular matrix deposition, lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the renal interstitium, and overall attenuation of the fibrotic process, translating ultimately into stabilization of renal function (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nBased on the comprehensive literature review, CY-09 emerges as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease. One of its greatest strengths lies in its robust and specific mechanism of action; by directly binding to the Walker A motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3, CY-09 efficiently prevents the initial ATP-driven steps that are critical for inflammasome assembly. This targeted inhibition ensures that downstream activation events—namely ASC speck formation, caspase-1 activation, and subsequent IL-1β/IL-18 maturation—are effectively suppressed. Such specificity is critical for minimizing off-target effects, as CY-09 has shown no significant interference with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, which could reduce undesirable immunosuppressive side effects (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The repurposing strategy is further supported by extensive preclinical evidence indicating that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 results in marked protection against renal fibrosis and inflammation in various CKD models. The preclinical efficacy of similar NLRP3 inhibitors such as MCC950 in models of diabetic nephropathy, cisplatin-induced renal injury, and ischemia-reperfusion injury reinforces the therapeutic potential of targeting NLRP3 in kidney disease (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017).\n\nAnother significant strength of CY-09 is its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile in rodent studies, which is an important consideration for chronic administration required in CKD therapy (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). This pharmacokinetic profile, along with the compound’s high potency in inflammatory assays where nanomolar inhibitory effects have been observed, provides confidence that CY-09 could achieve therapeutically effective concentrations in the kidney without systemic toxicity.\n\nHowever, there are also challenges and uncertainties. Although extensive preclinical studies in inflammatory disease models support the potential of CY-09, direct evidence of its efficacy in chronic kidney disease models specifically remains limited. The majority of studies to date have focused on sepsis, metabolic disorders, and murine colitis rather than on kidney-specific outcomes. There is, therefore, a need for more targeted preclinical research in CKD models—including those mimicking diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and cisplatin-induced renal fibrosis—to definitively establish the renoprotective effects of CY-09 (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Additionally, while the mechanism is well-characterized in immune cells like macrophages, further studies need to elucidate its effects specifically in human proximal tubular epithelial cells and other renal cell types that contribute to CKD progression. Such studies should evaluate not only biochemical markers of inflammasome activation but also functional outcomes like proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate, and histological indices of fibrosis.\n\nAnother potential weakness concerns the translational gap between rodent models and human CKD. The pathophysiology of CKD is multifactorial, and while NLRP3-mediated inflammation is a key driver, the disease process involves many convergent signaling pathways including TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling and oxidative stress pathways. It is possible that the blockade of NLRP3 alone may not be sufficient to fully arrest disease progression in humans. In addition, although CY-09 appears selective based on current evidence, there is always the risk of off-target effects when a compound modulates ATPase activity, given the abundance of ATP-binding proteins in the cell. Careful profiling of CY-09 against a broad spectrum of other ATPases and kinases will be necessary to confirm its selectivity in a clinical setting (Sandall et al., 2020).\n\nIn summary, CY-09 represents an innovative and mechanistically compelling therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease due to its direct inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a central mediator of renal inflammation and fibrosis. Its synthesis as a thiazolidinone derivative and its proven ability to bind the Walker A motif within the NACHT domain underscore its potential to precisely block inflammasome-driven pyroptosis. Preclinical evidence from models of various inflammatory conditions, along with robust biochemical data demonstrating nanomolar potency in macrophage assays, provides a strong rationale for its repurposing in kidney disease. Furthermore, its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety in rodent studies enhance its translational appeal. Nonetheless, additional research is needed to specifically validate its efficacy in CKD models, assess its long-term safety, and determine its pharmacodynamic effects in kidney-specific cell types such as proximal tubular epithelial cells. Overall, the strengths of CY-09’s targeted mechanism, coupled with supportive preclinical efficacy data from related inflammatory models, make it a promising candidate for further development and evaluation in Chronic Kidney Disease (ClinicalTrials.gov; Jiang et al., 2017; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nBertinaria, M., Gastaldi, S., Marini, E., & Giorgis, M.

The compound was synthesized via a chemically directed approach—in particular, its synthesis involved an alkylation reaction of sodium methanesulfinate with 3-bromopropionitrile, yielding a β-sulfonyl nitrile moiety that confers its inhibitory activity (Marchetti et al., 2018). This class of small molecule inhibitors has been widely explored for targeting inflammatory pathways through modulation of innate immune responses. Historically, β-sulfonyl nitrile compounds have attracted attention as therapeutic agents due to their capacity to engage key protein domains involved in inflammation while maintaining selectivity and oral bioavailability, attributes that are critical for chronic treatment regimens (Marchetti et al., 2018).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOLT1177 has progressed through several stages of development and clinical evaluation in diseases characterized by uncontrolled inflammation, notably in acute gout flares, heart failure, and conditions linked to cytokine release syndromes. In Phase I clinical trials, dapansutrile demonstrated an excellent safety profile when administered to healthy subjects at dosages up to 1000 mg per day for 8 days, thereby establishing its tolerability and preliminary evidence of target engagement (Jansen et al., 2019). Moreover, therapeutic evaluations in inflammatory settings—such as a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study in patients with NYHA II–III systolic heart failure—further underscored its favorable safety profile and pharmacodynamic effects despite the fact that current clinical investigations have not directly targeted Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) populations (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical studies in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy have demonstrated that treatment with OLT1177 leads to significant reductions in renal IL-1β levels, decreased macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis, suggesting that its benefits extend to kidney-related inflammatory damage (Mulay, 2019). Although clinical trials specifically focused on CKD or renal inflammation are lacking at this point, the robust anti-inflammatory effects observed in related models and conditions provide a sound rationale for repurposing OLT1177 in chronic kidney disease.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, OLT1177 selectively inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by targeting its central NACHT domain, where it interferes with ATPase activity that is critical for the oligomerization process necessary for inflammasome assembly. Under normal conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggers the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), leading to the formation of a multi-protein complex that activates caspase-1 and drives the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) (Kim et al., 2019). OLT1177 binds specifically to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, thereby blocking the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC, which is a necessary event for full inflammasome assembly (Marchetti et al., 2018). In doing so, it prevents the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-1 and effectively reduces the secretion of IL-1β. This mechanism is particularly significant in environments of hyperglycemic stress, where increased NLRP3 activity in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) drives inflammation, pyroptotic cell death, and subsequent tubulointerstitial fibrosis (Mulay, 2019). Additionally, by curtailing downstream cytokine release and pyroptosis, OLT1177 is believed to mitigate the metabolic cost of inflammation, an effect that has been observed in multiple preclinical in vivo studies in conditions ranging from acute arthritis to cardiac dysfunction (Jansen et al., 2019; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe central hypothesis is that through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, OLT1177 will effectively block the recruitment of ASC and disrupt subsequent caspase-1 activation in renal tubular cells, particularly under conditions of hyperglycemia which are common in diabetic nephropathy. Under hyperglycemic stress, renal tubular epithelial cells exhibit increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and aberrant inflammasome activation resulting in heightened secretion of IL-1β, a cytokine implicated in promoting fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition. By preventing the cleavage of pro-IL-1β into its active form, OLT1177 is expected to prevent pyroptotic cell death of TECs and interrupt the deleterious cycle of inflammation-driven fibrogenesis in the kidney (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Evidence from animal models indicates that selective blockade of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to a marked decrease in renal inflammation as evidenced by reduced macrophage infiltration and lower profibrotic cytokine levels, which supports the expectation that OLT1177 could yield appreciable renoprotective outcomes in CKD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In the proposed assay, it is anticipated that OLT1177 will reduce markers of inflammation such as IL-1β and IL-18 in the culture medium of hyperglycemia-stressed TECs, thereby correlating with decreased pyroptosis and improved cell viability. This would be further corroborated by downstream effects such as reduced activation of profibrotic pathways, including lower TGF-β signaling and diminished deposition of fibrotic markers, ultimately mitigating the progression toward renal fibrosis (Cliff, 2023; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate with substantial potential for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease owing to its well-characterized mechanism of action, favorable preclinical results, and established safety profile in early clinical studies. One of the major strengths of OLT1177 lies in its selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an attractive target given the critical role of NLRP3 in mediating renal inflammation, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenesis. Its synthetic origins and robust medicinal chemistry underpin its precise targeting of the NACHT domain in NLRP3, effectively sparing other inflammasomes and reducing the risk of broad immunosuppression (Marchetti et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Furthermore, its oral bioavailability and metabolic stability make it suitable for chronic administration, an essential consideration for CKD where long-term therapy is required (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nFrom a therapeutic history perspective, although OLT1177 has not yet been directly tested in human CKD patient populations, its successful progression through Phase I trials for conditions such as gout and heart failure, combined with promising data in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy, strongly supports its potential utility in renal settings (Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Preclinical studies show reduced renal IL-1β secretion, diminished macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis when NLRP3 is inhibited by agents like OLT1177, lending biological credence to the hypothesis that inflammasome inhibition could slow CKD progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nAt the molecular level, the precise action of OLT1177—binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ASC recruitment—represents a highly targeted approach that contrasts with cytokine-neutralizing therapies such as anti-IL-1β antibodies. This specificity is advantageous because it not only prevents the generation of IL-1β but also curtails the activation of NFκB and other downstream inflammatory cascades, potentially reducing off-target effects and preserving broader immune competence (Marchetti et al., 2018; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020). Additionally, the expected anti-inflammatory effects in renal tubular cells—specifically preventing pyroptosis and fibrogenesis—are consistent with literature demonstrating that NLRP3 is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells under hyperglycemic and inflammatory stress (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain. One of the limitations stems from the current lack of direct clinical evidence in CKD populations; while animal models provide a strong rationale, the translation of these findings into human CKD may be complicated by the multifactorial nature of the disease, where multiple pathways contribute to renal injury beyond inflammasome activation. Additionally, the chronic nature of CKD necessitates prolonged administration of therapeutic agents, and long-term safety data for OLT1177 in such a setting are still pending. There is also the possibility that inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome might impair necessary innate immune responses, although the specificity of OLT1177 for the NLRP3 complex—in contrast to more generalized anti-inflammatory agents—should, in theory, mitigate this concern (Seok et al., 2021).\n\nMoreover, while the preclinical data in models of diabetic nephropathy and crystal-induced kidney injury are promising, variability in genetic and environmental factors in human CKD could affect the compound’s efficacy. It will therefore be critical to design dedicated clinical trials in defined CKD populations, ideally incorporating biomarkers of inflammasome activity, such as circulating IL-1β and IL-18 levels, as well as imaging and functional assessments of renal fibrosis and function. The anti-fibrotic effects, in particular, warrant closer mechanistic studies to confirm that inhibition of TEC pyroptosis and preservation of tubular integrity occur in the human kidney as they do in animal models (Williams et al., 2022; Cliff, 2023).\n\nIn conclusion, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) represents a compelling candidate for repurposing in Chronic Kidney Disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, favorable pharmacological profile, and preclinical evidence supporting its renoprotective effects. Its ability to directly inhibit the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding to the NACHT domain and blocking ASC recruitment addresses a critical upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that leads to caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and subsequent pyroptosis of renal tubular cells. This mode of action has the potential to attenuate the inflammation-driven fibrogenesis that is central to CKD progression, particularly in diabetic nephropathy where hyperglycemic stress is a key driver of renal injury.\n\nStrengths of OLT1177 include its synthetic origin allowing for structural optimization, its demonstrated safety in Phase I clinical trials, its oral bioavailability which is advantageous for chronic therapy, and its selective inhibitory action that minimizes off-target effects. Additionally, existing preclinical studies showing reduced renal IL-1β, diminished macrophage infiltration, and lowered fibrotic responses in models of nephropathy provide a promising foundation for further exploration in CKD (Mulay, 2019; Jansen et al., 2019).\n\nWeaknesses or challenges include the current absence of dedicated clinical trials in CKD, the complexity of CKD pathophysiology where multiple inflammatory and fibrotic pathways are involved, and the potential risk that chronic inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome could in some contexts compromise the host defense or alter essential cellular processes. These concerns underscore the need for carefully designed preclinical studies specifically in renal disease models, followed by early phase clinical trials in well-defined CKD populations to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and long-term safety.\n\nOverall, based on the comprehensive literature review, the mechanistic rationale, and the encouraging preclinical and early clinical data available, OLT1177 shows significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease. The next steps should involve further detailed studies in CKD-specific preclinical models that assess not only inflammatory cytokine modulation but also functional outcomes such as glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria reduction, and fibrosis attenuation. A robust clinical development program targeting patients with diabetic nephropathy and other forms of CKD characterized by inflammasome activation would be the logical progression to validate its clinical utility (Marchetti et al., 2018; Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nReferences  \nCliff, C.

"(Tranilast, 3)","(INF4E, 4)","Both candidates target the NLRP3 inflammasome to reduce inflammation and fibrosis in CKD, but they differ substantially in evidence, safety, and translatability. Tranilast (ID 3) is a repurposed, clinically used small molecule with decades of human safety data in asthma, dermatitis, and keloids. It has been tested in multiple renal injury models—including diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction—showing reductions in proteinuria, collagen deposition, and markers of inflammation (IL-1β) and fibrosis (TGF-β, α-SMA). Early-phase human studies in diabetic nephropathy reported decreases in urinary collagen IV and albumin excretion, although no registered CKD trials exist. Mechanistically, tranilast disrupts NLRP3–ASC/NEK7 interactions by binding the LRR domain, and also attenuates TGF-β/Smad2 and PDGF signaling—two central CKD drivers. Its oral bioavailability, known PK, and well-characterized safety profile make rapid clinical translation feasible. The main gaps are formal CKD clinical trials and detailed biophysical validation of its NLRP3 binding.

INF4E (ID 4) is a novel covalent acrylate derivative that irreversibly inhibits NLRP3 by targeting the NACHT-ATP binding site. It was optimized for submicromolar potency in macrophage and sepsis models, with evidence of activity in IBD and cardiac ischemia preclinically. Its mechanism is clear and highly specific—covalent blockade of ATP hydrolysis required for NLRP3 oligomerization—offering prolonged inhibition of IL-1β/IL-18 release. However, it has no published studies in CKD or renal fibrosis models, no human safety data, and known risks of off-target cytotoxicity inherent to electrophilic covalent inhibitors. While rodent bioavailability is promising, its irreversible chemistry raises safety and DDI concerns that demand extensive ADME/PK and toxicology profiling. Translation into CKD will require de novo formulation, dosing, and safety work.

Overall, Tranilast’s extensive preclinical efficacy in CKD models, dual anti-inflammatory/anti-fibrotic MoA, established human safety, and oral dosing position it as a higher-probability candidate for successful experimental results and clinical translation. INF4E’s novelty and specificity are attractive scientifically, but the lack of CKD data and unclear safety profile present significant translatability risks.","Tranilast is supported by robust, directly relevant preclinical data in CKD models and preliminary human evidence, with an established safety record and dual mechanism addressing both inflammation (NLRP3) and fibrosis (TGF-β/PDGF). This contrasts with INF4E, whose potent, irreversible NLRP3 inhibition lacks any CKD‐specific efficacy data or human safety information and carries potential off‐target risks. The feasibility of repurposing Tranilast for CKD is far higher given its known PK, oral dosing, and favorable tolerability, making it the superior candidate.",20,"(3, 4)","{'hypothesis': 'Tranilast (MedChemExpress, catalog #HY-50819)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Tranilast (MedChemExpress, catalog #HY-50819)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nTranilast, commercially available from MedChemExpress (catalog #HY-50819), is a small-molecule synthetic compound originally developed as an anti-allergic agent. Chemically, it is an anthranilic acid derivative, specifically N-[3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl]-anthranilic acid, synthesized initially to treat allergic conditions such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and cutaneous disorders, including keloids and hypertrophic scars (Gilbert et al., 2012). The compound belongs to a class of agents that modulate inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways. The early synthesis of tranilast involved modifying the cinnamoyl anthranilate moiety to enhance potency against pro-fibrotic mediators like transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) while maintaining an acceptable toxicity profile. Over time, the compound’s anti-allergic properties were expanded by preclinical findings that demonstrated its potential to inhibit fibrotic changes via modulation of cytokine signaling and cellular proliferation pathways. This class of anthranilic acid derivatives has been used both in dermatologic and immunologic contexts, providing a background of clinical utility and safety that benefits the repurposing efforts for conditions such as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nTranilast has a well-documented history in clinical settings as an anti-allergic drug since its introduction in Japan decades ago. Its traditional indications have included treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and prevention of keloid formation. More recently, emerging preclinical studies have evaluated tranilast for its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in multiple organ systems. Notably, in experimental animal models of renal disease, tranilast has been investigated in contexts such as diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In these models, tranilast demonstrated the ability to reduce proteinuria, improve kidney structural integrity, and diminish collagen deposition (Gilbert et al., 2012). For instance, in diabetic nephropathy studies, tranilast reduced albuminuria and slowed the decline in glomerular filtration rate through attenuation of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix accumulation. Additionally, human studies in early-stage CKD patients, particularly those with diabetic nephropathy, receiving tranilast combined with standard therapies such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs have shown reductions in urinary markers like collagen type IV and albumin excretion (Gilbert et al., 2012). Beyond renal applications, the compound’s repurposing has been explored in cardiovascular contexts and even in certain inflammatory conditions driven by aberrant inflammasome activation, suggesting a versatility that supports further investigation into its utility against CKD. However, review of ClinicalTrials.gov did not reveal any registered trials directly assessing tranilast in CKD or related renal fibrosis, indicating that while preclinical and limited clinical observations are encouraging, robust clinical evaluation in CKD remains to be undertaken (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe hypothesized mechanism for tranilast in CKD centers on its ability to inhibit key inflammatory and fibrotic processes via direct intervention in inflammasome biology. Tranilast’s molecular target is the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex that plays a pivotal role in innate inflammatory responses. The assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires a coordinated interaction among NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and the serine/threonine kinase NEK7. Activation of this complex ultimately leads to the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form, which subsequently processes pro-IL-1β into IL-1β, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that drives pyroptosis and contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Specifically, tranilast is proposed to disrupt the critical interactions between NLRP3 and ASC as well as between NLRP3 and NEK7. This disruption is believed to occur via direct binding to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3, which is essential for its oligomerization and subsequent recruitment of ASC. By preventing ASC oligomerization, tranilast effectively halts the assembly of the inflammasome, thereby blocking caspase-1 activation and reducing IL-1β secretion (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).\n\nIn addition to inflammasome disruption, tranilast has been shown to attenuate TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling—another major contributor to kidney disease progression. TGF-β is well documented as a central mediator of extracellular matrix synthesis and fibroblast activation, and its overexpression in chronic kidney injury drives interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. Tranilast’s inhibition of TGF-β signaling includes the suppression of Smad2 phosphorylation and downstream fibrotic responses, leading to reductions in collagen deposition and interstitial matrix accumulation (Gilbert et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2019). Furthermore, tranilast’s capacity to inhibit PDGF signaling reduces mesangial cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in the renal glomerulus, providing an additional mechanistic avenue through which it exerts its renoprotective effects (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the proposed mechanism, the expected effect of tranilast in a CKD context is to attenuate tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis by mitigating both inflammatory and fibrotic signaling. In tubular epithelial cells (TECs), oxidative stress triggers activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in IL-1β secretion and pyroptotic cell death—a process that not only damages the epithelial barrier but also leads to further recruitment of inflammatory cells. By interfering with the NLRP3–ASC and NLRP3–NEK7 interactions, tranilast is anticipated to reduce caspase-1 activation. Consequently, a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis is expected, which would alleviate tubular inflammation under conditions of oxidative stress (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).\n\nFurthermore, the reduction in IL-1β and subsequent dampening of the inflammatory cascade should also lead to a decrease in TGF-β release. TGF-β is critically involved in driving fibroblast activation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. Thus, by curtailing the initial inflammasome-mediated inflammatory trigger, tranilast indirectly reduces TGF-β levels, thereby preventing its downstream pro-fibrotic effects. This is particularly relevant in diabetic nephropathy and UUO models, where TGF-β-mediated fibrosis is a major determinant of disease progression (Chen et al., 2020; Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nIn summary, the expected outcome in an in vitro or in vivo CKD assay would be a demonstrable decrease in markers of inflammation (such as IL-1β levels), reduced caspase-1 activity, diminished pyroptosis (as measured by LDH release or similar assays), and lowered expression of fibrotic markers including collagen, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Moreover, the preservation of tubular epithelial cell integrity and a consequent improvement in overall kidney function would provide functional support for tranilast’s therapeutic efficacy in CKD (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nTranilast represents a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease based on its dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. From a mechanistic standpoint, its ability to selectively disrupt the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting key protein–protein interactions (specifically between NLRP3, ASC, and NEK7) underpins its potential to reduce caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. This targeted mechanism is particularly attractive because it distinguishes tranilast from broader-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs that may have off-target effects. Moreover, by concurrently attenuating TGF-β signaling pathways, tranilast can reduce fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition—both critical contributors to the progression of CKD (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019).\n\nA major strength of tranilast is its established clinical use as an anti-allergic agent over several decades, which provides a substantial record of safety and tolerability in humans. Its oral dosing regimen further facilitates rapid clinical repurposing for CKD. Preclinical studies in animal models of diabetic nephropathy and UUO have demonstrated measurable benefits, such as reduced proteinuria and improved renal histology, lending support to its potential efficacy in human CKD (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nHowever, there are certain weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Despite promising preclinical data, there is a noted absence of registered clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with tranilast (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), which indicates that further clinical validation is required. Moreover, while tranilast’s inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is supported by various mechanistic studies, the precise molecular details—such as confirmation of binding to the LRR domain of NLRP3 and the exact nature of its impact on NEK7 interactions—require further elucidation through biochemical and structural studies (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). In addition, as with any repurposed drug, careful evaluation of potential off-target immunomodulatory effects is necessary. There have been reports of immune-mediated adverse events in other clinical indications, which, although not prominent, must be monitored during chronic administration in CKD patients (Strilchuk et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, the body of preclinical literature strongly supports the hypothesis that tranilast can disrupt NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and attenuate subsequent inflammatory and fibrotic cascades in the kidney. Given its dual mechanism—inhibiting both inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion and TGF-β–mediated fibrosis—tranilast emerges as an attractive candidate for repurposing in CKD. Its established use in other indications and favorable oral bioavailability further underscore its potential for rapid clinical translation. Nonetheless, the lack of direct clinical trial evidence in renal disease and the need for further mechanistic clarification represent critical challenges that the research team must address in subsequent studies (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023). Overall, the strengths of mechanistic specificity and a well-established safety profile position tranilast as a promising drug candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease, warranting further investigation through comprehensive preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials.\n\nReferences  \nChen, S., Wang, Y., Pan, Y., Liu, Y., Zheng, S., Ding, K., Mu, K., Yuan, Y., Li, Z., Song, H., Jin, Y., & Fu, J.

It is an acrylate derivative belonging to a class of compounds that harness α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl (Michael acceptor) functionalities to achieve covalent, irreversible inhibition of target proteins. Its discovery emerged during screening campaigns that looked for submicromolar potency against NLRP3, with subsequent chemical optimization to balance reactivity and cytotoxicity. Specifically, INF4E (also referred to in some studies as compound 9) was identified for its ability to selectively inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation by binding covalently to the NACHT domain’s ATP‐binding site, thereby interfering with ATP hydrolysis required for the conformational changes that lead to inflammasome assembly (Cocco et al., 2017; Blevins et al., 2022). As a member of the acrylate derivatives class, similar compounds have been explored in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular disorders, where targeting NLRP3 has shown promise. Members of this chemical class have a well‐documented history of being used as selective covalent modifiers with potential in modulating inflammatory signaling cascades.  \n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of INF4E and its related chemical family primarily stems from preclinical studies where they have been shown to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in various models of inflammation. INF4E was originally validated in sepsis models, demonstrating efficacy in reducing systemic inflammation, and subsequent studies extended its utility to show anti‐pyroptotic effects in macrophage cell lines with submicromolar potency. Moreover, related acrylate derivatives have been explored in inflammatory bowel disease models, where modifications to reduce cytotoxicity led to the generation of analogues such as INF39. Although the preclinical literature for this class of inhibitors is robust in the context of sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, and even in models of ischemic injury in the heart, there is no direct literature evidence that INF4E has been specifically used for treating chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis. Searches in Clinical Trials databases for “NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have revealed only nascent clinical exploration of NLRP3 inhibitors in renal disease, with most candidates like MCC950 and OLT1177 being at early development stages (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023). Thus, while INF4E’s mechanism of NLRP3 inhibition is highly relevant to inflammatory processes, its therapeutic history in kidney disease remains limited to preclinical mechanistic rationale rather than established clinical or veterinary use in CKD.  \n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, INF4E exerts its action by covalently binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, specifically targeting its ATP‐binding site. The NACHT domain is essential for NLRP3 oligomerization and subsequent inflammasome assembly. INF4E’s acrylate (Michael acceptor) moiety reacts with cysteine residues present in this domain, thereby irreversibly blocking ATP hydrolysis. The inhibition of ATP hydrolysis interferes directly with the required conformational changes that transform NLRP3 from an inactive to an active state capable of recruiting the adaptor protein ASC and procaspase‐1. Consequently, the subsequent cleavage of caspase‐1 is prevented, which in turn stops the maturation and release of key pro‐inflammatory cytokines, notably IL‐1β and IL‐18 (Mezzaroma et al., 2021; Cocco et al., 2017).  \nThis covalent binding mechanism is particularly significant because it offers prolonged inhibitory effects owing to its irreversible nature. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, where hypoxia serves as a potent priming signal for inflammasome activation and contributes to chronic inflammation and fibrosis, inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E is hypothesized to prevent the cascade leading to caspase‐1 activation, thus mitigating caspase‐1–dependent pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death—and reducing the release of IL‐18 (Blevins et al., 2022; Komada & Muruve, 2019).  \nThe biochemical interactions of INF4E align with the known structure–activity relationships of electrophilic acrylate derivatives, as these compounds are designed to target the ATPase activity of NLRP3. By interfering with this enzymatic function, INF4E halts the nucleation of the inflammasome complex, thereby curtailing downstream signaling that ultimately leads to pyroptosis and fibrogenesis. The short-lived yet potent irreversible binding is a hallmark of this class of inhibitors, which has been exploited in several preclinical studies to provide a potent blockade of inflammation (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the context of the proposed assay and the underlying pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease, INF4E is anticipated to exhibit a therapeutic effect by mitigating hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation in proximal tubular epithelial cells. Hypoxic conditions are known to prime and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in these cells, and this process is a major contributor to tubular cell injury, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenic signaling—all key drivers of CKD progression.  \nThe expected outcome when applying INF4E would be a significant reduction in ATP hydrolysis that is crucial for NLRP3 activation, thereby preventing the subsequent assembly of the inflammasome complex. This inhibition should lead to a decrease in caspase‐1 activity, ultimately lowering the maturation and secretion of IL‐18 (and possibly IL‐1β). Reduced levels of IL‐18 would then limit the inflammatory and fibrogenic signaling cascades that promote the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis. In assays using hypoxic proximal tubular cells, one would therefore predict reduced markers of pyroptosis, improved cell viability, and a lower expression of fibrogenic proteins such as TGF-β and α-SMA.  \nThere is also supportive evidence that NLRP3 is expressed in proximal tubular cells and that its activation is directly linked to inflammatory responses and fibrosis under hypoxic conditions (Ochoa et al., 2023; Komada & Muruve, 2019). The selective inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E should thus translate into improved cellular integrity and a mitigated progression of the inflammatory milieu that typifies CKD. This expected modulation of pyroptosis and fibrosis markers provides a clear biochemical rationale for using INF4E as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic therapeutic candidate in kidney disease models.  \n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe analysis of INF4E as a repurposed drug candidate for chronic kidney disease presents both promising and challenging aspects. One major strength of INF4E lies in its clearly defined mechanism of action; by targeting the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and interfering with ATP hydrolysis, INF4E offers a direct method to abrogate inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. This is particularly relevant in CKD, where hypoxia-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in proximal tubular cells is a key pathological event leading to pyroptosis, inflammation, and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019).  \nAnother strength is its proven submicromolar potency as demonstrated in phenotypic screens, along with a degree of oral bioavailability in rodent models that supports the feasibility of future in vivo investigations (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021). This potency, combined with its specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome, positions INF4E as a candidate with the potential to modulate inflammatory responses without broadly suppressing the entire immune system. Moreover, by specifically reducing IL-18 release, INF4E may offer advantages over broader anti-inflammatory approaches that risk impairing normal host defense mechanisms (Thomas et al., 2022).  \nA potential weakness, however, is the risk associated with irreversible covalent binding, which, while conferring prolonged effects, may also lead to off-target toxicity if the selectivity is not absolute. Some acrylate derivatives have been noted for cytotoxicity issues, and although chemical optimization—such as the development of related compounds like INF39—has been undertaken to alleviate these concerns, it remains a critical point for evaluation in renal cells that are already susceptible to injury under hypoxic conditions (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \nFurthermore, while the mechanistic rationale for targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in CKD is strong, the clinical translation of NLRP3 inhibitors has been slow. Currently, only limited clinical trial data are available for NLRP3 inhibitors in CKD, and the majority of evidence remains at the preclinical level (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023).  \nAnother consideration is that chronic kidney disease is a multifactorial condition wherein inflammasome activation is just one of several pathogenic processes, including metabolic dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and oxidative stress. Therefore, while INF4E may effectively block one critical pathway—namely, hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation—it might need to be combined with therapies targeting other aspects of CKD pathogenesis to achieve a comprehensive therapeutic effect (Unknown Reference; Mulay, 2019).  \nDespite these challenges, INF4E’s selectivity for a mechanistically validated target, its oral availability, and its demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory models provide a strong rationale for further investigation. In assays designed to model hypoxic tubular injury, INF4E is expected to reduce pyroptosis and fibrogenic signaling, thereby slowing CKD progression. The drug’s success in other inflammatory contexts, such as sepsis models, lends additional weight to its potential, although caution must be exercised when extrapolating these data to the complex microenvironment of the kidney (Blevins et al., 2022; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \n\nContinued research should focus on dosing optimization, safety profiling in kidney-specific models, and investigation of combination strategies that target both inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in CKD (Komada & Muruve, 2019; Mulay, 2019; Pagliaro & Penna, 2023; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nOverall, INF4E represents a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for chronic kidney disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, which aligns well with an established pathogenic pathway in CKD—namely, hypoxia-driven NLRP3 inflammasome activation in proximal tubular cells. Its ability to block the ATPase activity of NLRP3, thereby preventing both caspase-1 activation and IL-18 release, underpins a novel strategy aimed at mitigating pyroptosis and subsequent fibrogenic signaling cascades. While challenges such as potential off-target cytotoxicity, the need for extensive in vivo validation in CKD models, and integration into a multifactorial therapeutic approach remain, the compelling preclinical data for related compounds and the rigorous mechanistic underpinnings provide a strong basis for advancing INF4E in further preclinical studies and eventual clinical trials. Continued research should include detailed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological evaluations in renal models, as well as assessments of its efficacy in reducing markers of inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrosis in hypoxic proximal tubular cells. Given the complexity of CKD, INF4E may ultimately be best suited for combination therapy alongside agents addressing complementary pathogenic mechanisms. Overall, the potential strengths of INF4E—rooted in its selective, irreversible inhibition of a well‐validated molecular target—are balanced by the need for careful evaluation of safety and clinical translatability in the setting of chronic kidney disease (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nReferences:  \nBlevins, H.

"(VX-765, 5)","(INF4E, 4)","Both candidates target inflammasome‐mediated pathways implicated in CKD, but they differ markedly in evidentiary support, safety profiles, and translational readiness. 1) Strength and Relevance of Supporting Evidence: VX-765 has demonstrated efficacy in rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and UUO, showing reduced IL-1β/IL-18, macrophage infiltration, and collagen deposition. Moreover, it has advanced to Phase II trials in other inflammatory disorders, establishing human safety and target engagement. In contrast, INF4E’s evidence is limited to in vitro and non‐renal in vivo inflammatory models (sepsis, IBD, cardiac ischemia) with no direct CKD data. 2) Mechanism of Action: INF4E covalently inhibits NLRP3’s NACHT ATPase domain, blocking upstream inflammasome assembly, a mechanistically attractive but highly reactive approach with potential off‐target risks. VX-765 selectively and irreversibly inhibits caspase-1—a central effector downstream of inflammasomes—blocking cytokine maturation and pyroptosis. The caspase-1 target is well defined, and X-ray structural data support selectivity over apoptotic caspases. 3) Safety and Tolerability: VX-765’s clinical trial history (epilepsy, psoriasis) provides an established safety profile; its prodrug design limits systemic reactivity. INF4E’s acrylate Michael acceptor raises concerns of promiscuous covalent binding, potential cytotoxicity, and unpredictable off‐target effects, especially in vulnerable renal cells. 4) Feasibility and Drug Delivery: VX-765 is orally bioavailable, has defined PK/PD, and achieves therapeutic levels in humans. INF4E has only rodent oral bioavailability data and lacks ADME characterization in kidney. Both can be tested in renal cell and rodent CKD models, but VX-765’s path to clinic is clearer. 5) Novelty: INF4E’s targeting of NLRP3 is novel for CKD but carries higher translational risk. VX-765’s repurposing leverages robust data and a known mechanism. Overall, VX-765 combines stronger CKD‐relevant efficacy data, a well‐characterized MoA, established safety in humans, and feasible delivery, outweighing INF4E’s preclinical promise but translational uncertainties.","VX-765 outperforms INF4E because it brings robust preclinical CKD efficacy, a well‐defined and selective mechanism, proven oral bioavailability, and human safety data.

This is particularly relevant in CKD, where hypoxia-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in proximal tubular cells is a key pathological event leading to pyroptosis, inflammation, and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019).  \nAnother strength is its proven submicromolar potency as demonstrated in phenotypic screens, along with a degree of oral bioavailability in rodent models that supports the feasibility of future in vivo investigations (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021). This potency, combined with its specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome, positions INF4E as a candidate with the potential to modulate inflammatory responses without broadly suppressing the entire immune system. Moreover, by specifically reducing IL-18 release, INF4E may offer advantages over broader anti-inflammatory approaches that risk impairing normal host defense mechanisms (Thomas et al., 2022).  \nA potential weakness, however, is the risk associated with irreversible covalent binding, which, while conferring prolonged effects, may also lead to off-target toxicity if the selectivity is not absolute. Some acrylate derivatives have been noted for cytotoxicity issues, and although chemical optimization—such as the development of related compounds like INF39—has been undertaken to alleviate these concerns, it remains a critical point for evaluation in renal cells that are already susceptible to injury under hypoxic conditions (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \nFurthermore, while the mechanistic rationale for targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in CKD is strong, the clinical translation of NLRP3 inhibitors has been slow. Currently, only limited clinical trial data are available for NLRP3 inhibitors in CKD, and the majority of evidence remains at the preclinical level (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023).  \nAnother consideration is that chronic kidney disease is a multifactorial condition wherein inflammasome activation is just one of several pathogenic processes, including metabolic dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and oxidative stress. Therefore, while INF4E may effectively block one critical pathway—namely, hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation—it might need to be combined with therapies targeting other aspects of CKD pathogenesis to achieve a comprehensive therapeutic effect (Unknown Reference; Mulay, 2019).  \nDespite these challenges, INF4E’s selectivity for a mechanistically validated target, its oral availability, and its demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory models provide a strong rationale for further investigation. In assays designed to model hypoxic tubular injury, INF4E is expected to reduce pyroptosis and fibrogenic signaling, thereby slowing CKD progression. The drug’s success in other inflammatory contexts, such as sepsis models, lends additional weight to its potential, although caution must be exercised when extrapolating these data to the complex microenvironment of the kidney (Blevins et al., 2022; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \n\nContinued research should focus on dosing optimization, safety profiling in kidney-specific models, and investigation of combination strategies that target both inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in CKD (Komada & Muruve, 2019; Mulay, 2019; Pagliaro & Penna, 2023; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nOverall, INF4E represents a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for chronic kidney disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, which aligns well with an established pathogenic pathway in CKD—namely, hypoxia-driven NLRP3 inflammasome activation in proximal tubular cells. Its ability to block the ATPase activity of NLRP3, thereby preventing both caspase-1 activation and IL-18 release, underpins a novel strategy aimed at mitigating pyroptosis and subsequent fibrogenic signaling cascades. While challenges such as potential off-target cytotoxicity, the need for extensive in vivo validation in CKD models, and integration into a multifactorial therapeutic approach remain, the compelling preclinical data for related compounds and the rigorous mechanistic underpinnings provide a strong basis for advancing INF4E in further preclinical studies and eventual clinical trials. Continued research should include detailed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological evaluations in renal models, as well as assessments of its efficacy in reducing markers of inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrosis in hypoxic proximal tubular cells. Given the complexity of CKD, INF4E may ultimately be best suited for combination therapy alongside agents addressing complementary pathogenic mechanisms. Overall, the potential strengths of INF4E—rooted in its selective, irreversible inhibition of a well‐validated molecular target—are balanced by the need for careful evaluation of safety and clinical translatability in the setting of chronic kidney disease (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nReferences:  \nBlevins, H.

It belongs to the class of caspase-1 inhibitors, which are designed to target the proteolytic enzyme caspase‐1 responsible for the post-translational processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Originally discovered through efforts to identify small molecules that could modulate inflammasome-mediated inflammation, VX-765 was synthesized to covalently interact with the catalytic cysteine residue of caspase‐1 and thereby block its activity. This group of compounds is part of a broader category of anti-inflammatory agents that have been applied in conditions where excessive inflammasome activation leads to tissue damage, and they have been used in clinical studies for disorders such as epilepsy and psoriasis, demonstrating that this drug class can effectively modulate immune signaling pathways and cytokine maturation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nVX-765 has an established history in preclinical and early clinical research. It has advanced into Phase II trials in both epilepsy and psoriasis, conditions associated with chronic inflammation and abnormal cytokine signaling, thereby establishing a safety profile and demonstrating adequate target engagement in humans. Although it has not been widely evaluated in clinical trials specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), preclinical studies conducted in rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) have demonstrated that VX-765 effectively reduces markers of inflammation such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), diminishes macrophage infiltration, and reduces collagen deposition, which are indicative of reduced fibrotic remodeling in the kidney (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024). Additionally, the general class of caspase-1 inhibitors has been successfully applied in various inflammatory conditions, and mechanistic studies suggest that inhibiting caspase-1 can interrupt the cascade leading to pyroptotic cell death—a key factor in inflammatory tissue damage. Although there is no large-scale clinical trial data in CKD to date, the compound’s mechanism, coupled with existing human safety data from other indications, strongly supports its rapid repurposing potential for kidney diseases (Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nVX-765’s mechanism of action is centered on the selective inhibition of caspase-1, an essential enzyme involved in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, and in mediating a form of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that VX-765 is a prodrug that is metabolized into VRT-043198, which binds irreversibly to the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys285) in the active site of caspase-1 through covalent interactions. Structural analyses, including crystallography experiments, have elucidated that VRT-043198 makes additional hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with key residues (e.g., R179, Q283, P343, and R383) ensuring a high degree of selectivity for inflammatory caspases over apoptotic caspases (Yang, 2019). By blocking caspase-1, VX-765 prevents the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active cytokine forms, thereby reducing the release of these potent inflammatory mediators; it also prevents the cleavage of gasdermin D, a critical effector protein required to form membrane pores that mediate pyroptotic cell death. In renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and other cell types implicated in kidney disease, such proclivity for pyroptosis can drive local inflammatory cascades and fibrotic signaling, so inhibiting caspase-1 may mitigate these processes (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). The specificity of VX-765 for caspase-1 has been confirmed through both in vitro assays—with assessments of IL-1β release and gasdermin D cleavage—and in vivo models where administration of VX-765 led to reduced serum IL-1β, improved survival in sepsis models, and attenuation of inflammatory tissue injury (Yang, 2019; Liu et al., 2023).\n\nExpected Effect in Chronic Kidney Disease:  \nIn the context of Chronic Kidney Disease, particularly conditions characterized by diabetic nephropathy and renal fibrosis, the hypothesis is that VX-765 will reduce caspase-1 mediated pyroptosis and subsequent inflammatory cytokine release in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). TEC pyroptosis contributes to tubular cell death and triggers a deleterious inflammatory milieu that ultimately drives fibrotic remodeling through the activation of myofibroblasts and increased deposition of extracellular matrix components such as collagen. VX-765 is expected to block this cascade at an early step by preventing the activation of caspase-1, thereby limiting IL-1β and IL-18 maturation and secretion. This, in turn, should reduce the recruitment and activation of inflammatory macrophages—a process that has been shown to contribute to fibrogenesis in the kidney (Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Preclinical evidence from rodent models supports that administration of VX-765 leads to decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced expression of pro-fibrotic markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and a lower deposition of collagen, thereby preserving renal tubular structure and function. Considering caspase-1 and the inflammasome complex are expressed in renal cells including TECs and resident macrophages, targeting caspase-1 is a rational approach to interrupt the feedback loop between cell death and inflammation that exacerbates CKD progression (Zhou & Li, 2023; Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of VX-765 as a therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease include its well-defined mechanism of action, oral bioavailability, and the fact that it has already undergone Phase II clinical trials in other indications, demonstrating an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in humans. The mechanistic rationale is strong: by targeting caspase-1, VX-765 interrupts the inflammasome-driven cascade responsible for both pyroptotic cell death and the maturation of key pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in renal fibrosis. Preclinical models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction have provided promising evidence that caspase-1 inhibition can reduce renal inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and extracellular matrix deposition, suggesting that VX-765 might slow the progression of fibrotic changes in CKD (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). Furthermore, targeting a central mediator such as caspase-1 may have broader benefits by influencing several downstream inflammatory pathways simultaneously, thus potentially overcoming the limitations of therapies that target individual cytokines.  \nWeaknesses include the translational gap that currently exists between preclinical efficacy in rodent models and clinical benefit in human CKD patients. Although VX-765 has demonstrated safety in epilepsy and psoriasis trials, the long-term effects of inhibiting caspase-1 in a chronic disease setting like CKD are not fully understood, particularly given the complex roles that inflammasome signaling may play in tissue repair, host defense, and kidney homeostasis. There is also the possibility that fully inhibiting caspase-1 could lead to compensatory activation of alternative inflammatory pathways or unintended off-target effects, especially in patients with compromised kidney function. Additionally, while preclinical data are encouraging, there is a need for dedicated clinical trials in CKD and related fibrotic conditions to establish the optimal dosing, efficacy, and safety profile in this specific patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).  \nOverall, VX-765 exhibits several promising attributes as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for CKD: its defined molecular target, demonstrated anti-inflammatory mechanism through caspase-1 inhibition, and supportive preclinical evidence of renoprotection provide a compelling rationale for further investigation. The strengths of existing human safety data and oral administration combine with a robust mechanistic framework to justify advancing VX-765 into clinical trials in patients with CKD. Nonetheless, further research is required to clarify long-term effects on renal function, potential compensatory inflammatory mechanisms, and the detailed pharmacodynamics in the setting of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. With carefully designed clinical studies focusing on renal endpoints, VX-765 could represent a valuable addition to the therapeutic arsenal against CKD, particularly for patients whose disease is driven significantly by inflammasome-mediated inflammation and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

"(Disulfiram, 0)","(CY-09, 7)","Both candidates target inflammatory pathways central to CKD progression: Disulfiram inhibits GSDMD-driven pyroptosis, while CY-09 blocks NLRP3 inflammasome assembly upstream of pyroptosis. Strength and Relevance of Evidence: Disulfiram benefits from decades of clinical use and established human safety, plus specific preclinical data in renal ischemia–reperfusion AKI models demonstrating caspase-11–GSDMD axis inhibition and amelioration of renal injury. However, direct chronic kidney disease or fibrosis models are lacking. CY-09 shows potent nanomolar inhibition of NLRP3 in macrophages, efficacy in sepsis, colitis, metabolic models, and genetic NLRP3 knockout data supporting a role in renal fibrosis, but direct CKD or kidney epithelial cell data for CY-09 itself are absent. Mechanism of Action: Disulfiram’s covalent modification of GSDMD is clear, direct, and relevant to tubular epithelial cell pyroptosis driving interstitial inflammation. CY-09’s mechanism is well defined—competitive inhibition of ATP binding to NLRP3’s NACHT domain—preventing inflammasome assembly; this upstream block may have broad anti-inflammatory effects but is farther from the terminal fibrotic events. Safety and Tolerability: Disulfiram has a long FDA-approved safety record at oral doses, known PK/PD, and manageable toxicity. CY-09 is only in preclinical development; rodent studies suggest tolerability and oral bioavailability but human safety is untested. Feasibility: Disulfiram’s oral dosing, known ADME, and metabolite work with copper to improve potency; detailed dose optimization in the renal context is needed. CY-09 has oral bioavailability in rodents and good selectivity, but ADME/PK in humans and kidney distribution data are not yet available. Scientific Novelty: Both are repurposing approaches and novel in CKD. The GSDMD target (Disulfiram) is a recently discovered effector in pyroptosis; CY-09’s NLRP3 target is well established in CKD pathogenesis but its specific chemotype CY-09 is newer. Overall, Disulfiram has the edge due to robust translational evidence in kidney injury, an established safety profile, and a direct mechanism in relevant cell types.","Between the two candidates, Disulfiram (ID: 0) presents a stronger case for rapid translation: it already has validated in vivo renal injury data, an FDA-approved safety profile, known human PK/PD, and a mechanistically direct inhibition of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in tubular epithelial cells. CY-09 (ID: 7) offers a highly specific and potent NLRP3 inhibition mechanism, but it lacks CKD-specific proof-of-concept, human safety data, and detailed renal ADME studies. Although CY-09’s upstream blockade could provide broader inflammasome suppression, the absence of preclinical CKD models and human tolerability limits its near-term translatability. Therefore, Disulfiram is the preferred candidate for advancing into CKD‐focused development.",22,"(0, 7)","{'hypothesis': 'Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nDisulfiram is a synthetic small‐molecule drug originally discovered more than seventy years ago and is well known for its unique chemical structure featuring a tetraethylthiuram disulfide core. It is typically synthesized via the oxidation of diethyldithiocarbamate salts derived from the reaction of carbon disulfide with diethylamine, producing a compound with a central disulfide bond that confers its thiol‐reactive properties (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13). Chemically, disulfiram belongs to the dithiocarbamate family and is classified pharmacologically as an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor. Historically, this inhibition of ALDH has been the molecular basis for its clinical application as an alcohol aversion agent, where disulfiram induces the accumulation of acetaldehyde following alcohol ingestion, causing an assortment of discomforting physiological effects such as flushing, nausea, and tachycardia (Lu et al., 2021, p. 12). More recently, however, disulfiram has assumed a new identity in drug repurposing initiatives; its ability to interact covalently with cysteine residues in target proteins – a consequence of its thiuram disulfide structure – has attracted considerable attention in the context of inflammatory diseases. In particular, its capacity to interfere with the function of gasdermin D (GSDMD) via covalent modification is emerging as a promising mechanism by which disulfiram could counteract pathological inflammatory pathways (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4). This newly recognized activity places disulfiram within a therapeutic class of established drugs that are being re‐evaluated beyond their original indications, seeking to exploit their long clinical history and known safety profiles for novel applications such as the modulation of pyroptosis in inflammatory pathologies like chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nDisulfiram has a long-established history, primarily being used in the management of chronic alcohol use disorder since its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the early 1950s. As a stand‐alone therapy, its effectiveness in producing a pronounced aversive reaction to ethanol intake has made it a mainstay in addiction medicine. Over the decades, disulfiram has been administered safely to vast numbers of patients – a fact that is of critical importance when considering repurposing efforts, as its pharmacokinetics, dosing parameters, and toxicity profiles are well documented (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3). In addition to its established role in alcohol abstinence, disulfiram has been repurposed for a number of other applications. Emerging investigations have highlighted its promising activity in malignancies, where disulfiram, often in conjunction with supplemental copper, has demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against cancer stem cells via mechanisms that involve proteasome inhibition and modulation of redox homeostasis (Lu et al., 2021, pp. 13–14; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). More recently, its anti-inflammatory potential has been explored in the context of infectious diseases and systemic inflammatory responses. For instance, disulfiram has been evaluated in sepsis models, where its inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis led to reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines and improved survival in animal models (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). In models of ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), disulfiram pretreatment was shown to ameliorate renal dysfunction and histological damage by suppressing the noncanonical caspase-11–GSDMD inflammatory axis (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6). Although direct clinical studies of disulfiram in chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis remain limited, the encouraging preclinical signals from acute kidney insults and its capacity to modulate cell death pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation suggest that disulfiram—and its metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate—might be effective in attenuating the injurious inflammatory cascades observed in CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, the repurposing hypothesis for disulfiram in chronic kidney disease centers on its recently identified inhibitory effect on gasdermin D (GSDMD), a pore-forming effector protein that is indispensable for the execution of pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory, lytic form of programmed cell death triggered by the activation of inflammasomes. When these multiprotein complexes form in response to pathogenic stimuli or sterile injury, they lead to the activation of inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1, and in noncanonical pathways, caspase-4/5/11. These enzymes cleave GSDMD to generate an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) that oligomerizes and inserts into the plasma membrane to form pores, thereby releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) into the extracellular milieu (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17). Disulfiram has been shown to block this crucial terminal step in pyroptosis by covalently modifying a conserved cysteine residue (Cys191 in human GSDMD and Cys192 in murine GSDMD) through a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. This chemical modification prevents the oligomerization and subsequent membrane pore formation by GSDMD, thereby directly inhibiting the execution phase of pyroptosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). Moreover, disulfiram’s activity is potentiated in the presence of copper ions, which may stabilize its reactive metabolites such as diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC), enhancing its inhibitory potency in cellular assays (Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18). The outcome of this inhibition is a significant reduction in the pyroptotic cell death cascade, as evidenced by decreased IL-1β release and overall attenuation of inflammatory signaling. In the context of the kidney, specifically within tubular epithelial cells (TECs), the inflammatory microenvironment driven by inflammasome activation is one of the critical factors in the progression from acute injury to chronic fibrosis. TECs are known to express inflammasome components and are susceptible to pyroptosis, which contributes to interstitial inflammation and fibrogenesis (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Therefore, by inhibiting the cleavage and activation of GSDMD in these cells, disulfiram has the potential to preserve tubular integrity and prevent the inflammatory cascade that ultimately drives chronic kidney injury.\n\nExpected Effect:  \nBased on the proposed hypothesis and data from related inflammatory and renal injury models, disulfiram is predicted to exert a protective effect in the setting of chronic kidney disease by targeting the final common pathway of pyroptotic cell death. In a typical in vitro assay using primary tubular epithelial cells or established TEC lines, treatment with disulfiram at concentrations within the non-cytotoxic range (e.g., 0.1–5 µM as indicated in hypoxia/reoxygenation models) is expected to prevent the formation of GSDMD pores, thereby reducing cell membrane disruption, limiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18), and preserving cell viability (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11). The expected molecular signature following disulfiram treatment would include decreased levels of cleaved (active) GSDMD, reduced caspase-11 activation along with lower concentrations of circulating cytokines, as well as preserved markers of epithelial cell integrity. Given that GSDMD and components of the inflammasome are expressed in tubular epithelial cells (as supported by studies focusing on renal inflammatory pathways; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 7–9; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 9–10), the inhibition of GSDMD pore formation directly addresses a mechanistic driver of tubular injury. This would translate into reduced interstitial inflammation and limited myofibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition, which are critical steps in the fibrotic process that underpins CKD progression (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Ultimately, the expectation is that a therapeutic regimen involving disulfiram may slow or even halt the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease by mitigating the damaging effects of pyroptosis.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nDisulfiram presents several attractive features as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. The strengths of disulfiram include:  \n1. A well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profile, supported by decades of clinical use in alcohol aversion therapy, which facilitates rapid translation into new clinical contexts (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Lu et al., 2021, p. 12).  \n2. A clear and innovative mechanism of action based on the inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis. This mechanism is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of CKD, where inflammasome activation and resultant pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells contribute to interstitial inflammation and fibrosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11).  \n3. The potential for its active metabolite, diethyldithiocarbamate, and the enhancing role of copper complexation to improve its potency as a pyroptosis inhibitor further bolster the therapeutic rationale (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18; Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34).  \n4. Preclinical evidence in models of acute kidney injury (ischemia-reperfusion injury) demonstrates that disulfiram can ameliorate renal dysfunction through inhibition of the caspase-11–GSDMD axis, suggesting that similar effects may be achieved in chronic inflammatory settings underlying CKD (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11).  \n\nHowever, there are also potential weaknesses and gaps that warrant further exploration:  \n1. Despite promising preclinical data in acute injury models and other inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, direct evidence of disulfiram’s efficacy in chronic kidney disease models remains limited. The available studies do not present long-term data specific to CKD or renal fibrosis, which is critical for validating its use in a chronic condition (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6).  \n2. While the mechanism of covalent modification of GSDMD at Cys191 is well supported by molecular studies, the extrapolation of these findings to tubular epithelial cells in the kidney (as opposed to macrophages or other inflammatory cells) requires additional confirmation. It is essential to verify that TECs exhibit similar susceptibility to the gasdermin D inhibitory effects of disulfiram under pathological conditions (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n3. Dosage optimization, chronic toxicity assessments, and potential off-target effects in the renal context have not yet been extensively characterized. Although the historical human use of disulfiram supports a favorable safety profile, the dosing regimen for CKD might differ from that used for alcohol aversion therapy, given the distinct pharmacodynamics required to inhibit pyroptosis in kidney tissues (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8).  \n4. Another consideration is the effect of systemic modulation of pyroptosis. Since pyroptosis is integral to effective immune responses under certain circumstances, indiscriminate long-term inhibition could potentially compromise host defenses against infections. This balance between therapeutic efficacy in CKD and preservation of necessary immune functions must be carefully evaluated in preclinical models and eventually in clinical trials (Hu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n\nIn summary, disulfiram emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease due to its novel mechanism of targeting gasdermin D-induced pyroptosis—a pathway that is increasingly recognized as a critical driver of renal inflammation and fibrogenesis. Its long clinical history, established oral bioavailability, and well-characterized safety profile offer substantial advantages that could accelerate its translation into CKD-focused studies. The evidence from acute kidney injury models and inflammatory disease research forms a strong mechanistic rationale for its use to preserve tubular epithelial integrity and mitigate interstitial inflammation. Nevertheless, further detailed studies are imperative to validate its effectiveness in chronic kidney models, delineate optimal dosing strategies, and ensure that the inhibition of pyroptosis does not adversely affect normal immune surveillance. Based on the data reviewed—from biochemical studies demonstrating covalent modification of GSDMD (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8) to preclinical studies in renal injury models (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6)—the overall evaluation supports continued investigation of disulfiram as a repurposed agent in CKD. Its potential to modulate a critical pathogenic pathway in chronic kidney injury could represent a novel therapeutic intervention that merits further preclinical and clinical development (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18).\n\nReferences  \nCai, Q., Sun, Z., Xu, S., Jiao, X., Guo, S., Li, Y., Wu, H., & Yu, X.

Chemically, CY-09 belongs to the class of thiazolidinone derivatives, a category known for its capacity to interfere with enzymatic activities via covalent or non-covalent interactions. Its development was driven by the need to specifically target the ATP-binding site within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, particularly focusing on the Walker A motif—a conserved nucleotide-binding region that is essential for the ATPase activity required for NLRP3 oligomerization. The design rationale behind CY-09 was based on structure-based drug design principles, where the compound was engineered to directly bind NLRP3, thereby preventing the conformational changes necessary for inflammasome assembly. This chemical class has previously been used in various contexts to modulate protein–enzyme interactions, and its application in inflammasome biology represents an evolution of this approach to target excessive inflammation mediated by the innate immune system (Jiang et al., 2017; Bertinaria et al., 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of CY-09 is rooted in preclinical studies where it has been extensively characterized in vitro and in animal models of inflammatory diseases. Initially, CY-09 demonstrated potent inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in murine bone marrow–derived macrophages stimulated with canonical activators such as ATP, nigericin, and monosodium urate crystals, showing a dose-dependent reduction in IL-1β secretion and caspase-1 activation. Its efficacy has been documented in rodent models of sepsis and colitis, as well as in metabolic disorder models where NLRP3-driven inflammation is a core pathological feature. Although no clinical trials having been completed in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) specifically have been reported to date, the compound’s inclusion in multiple clinical trial searches (ClinicalTrials.gov) indicates that there is active interest in repurposing or further evaluating NLRP3 inhibitors like CY-09 in kidney-related conditions. Furthermore, the extensive body of work demonstrating that NLRP3 knockout or pharmacological inhibition confers protection against renal fibrosis, tubular inflammation, and other hallmarks of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Zhou & Li, 2023) supports the translational potential of a molecule such as CY-09. Historically, similar NLRP3 inhibitors (for example, MCC950) have been applied in various preclinical models of inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and their protective effects in conditions like diabetic nephropathy and ischemia-reperfusion injury provide a strong rationale for applying CY-09 in CKD (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nCY-09 exerts its therapeutic action by directly binding to the NLRP3 protein at its NACHT domain, specifically targeting the Walker A (or P-loop) motif responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis. This binding event competitively inhibits ATP from accessing the site, thereby blocking the ATPase activity essential for NLRP3 oligomerization. Without ATP hydrolysis, NLRP3 is unable to undergo the conformational rearrangements necessary for the aggregation of multiple NLRP3 molecules into the inflammasome complex. Consequently, the formation of the adaptor protein ASC specks is prevented, leading to a blockade of pro-caspase-1 activation and subsequent cleavage into its active form. This chain of events ultimately results in a reduction of the maturation and secretion of the central proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and it halts gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis—a form of lytic, inflammatory cell death that substantially contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis in CKD. Importantly, studies have demonstrated that CY-09 does not interfere with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, underscoring its molecular specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2019). The molecular interaction of CY-09 is supported by biotinylated pull-down assays which confirm its selective binding to NLRP3 over other inflammasome components, and computational docking models corroborate a binding mode that is competitive with ATP at the Walker A motif (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017). This detailed molecular mechanism signifies that CY-09 operates at an early and critical step in the inflammasome pathway, making it a highly attractive candidate for diseases with a significant inflammatory component, such as CKD (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe proposed hypothesis for applying CY-09 to CKD is that by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in human proximal tubular epithelial cells, the compound will inhibit ATPase-driven oligomerization of NLRP3, thereby reducing the formation of ASC specks, the activation of caspase-1, and the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. The downstream effect of blocking these events is the inhibition of gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis, which is known to drive tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrotic remodeling—a central hallmark in the progression of CKD. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, NLRP3 is expressed and activated in response to various stress stimuli, including oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and metabolic dysregulation, all of which are common in CKD pathogenesis. By impeding this pathway, CY-09 is expected to diminish inflammatory cytokine secretion and reduce cell death, thereby preserving tubular integrity, minimizing interstitial inflammation, and preventing the fibrotic changes that culminate in renal function decline (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Data from preclinical models of kidney injury, such as those using MCC950 and other NLRP3 knockout models, have consistently shown improvements in renal structure and function, and reduction in profibrotic markers upon inhibition of the NLRP3 pathway (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017). Furthermore, oral bioavailability and a favorable safety profile in rodent studies enhance the clinical feasibility of CY-09 as a repurposed agent for CKD (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The expected effects in a CKD model would therefore include reduced extracellular matrix deposition, lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the renal interstitium, and overall attenuation of the fibrotic process, translating ultimately into stabilization of renal function (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nBased on the comprehensive literature review, CY-09 emerges as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease. One of its greatest strengths lies in its robust and specific mechanism of action; by directly binding to the Walker A motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3, CY-09 efficiently prevents the initial ATP-driven steps that are critical for inflammasome assembly. This targeted inhibition ensures that downstream activation events—namely ASC speck formation, caspase-1 activation, and subsequent IL-1β/IL-18 maturation—are effectively suppressed. Such specificity is critical for minimizing off-target effects, as CY-09 has shown no significant interference with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, which could reduce undesirable immunosuppressive side effects (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The repurposing strategy is further supported by extensive preclinical evidence indicating that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 results in marked protection against renal fibrosis and inflammation in various CKD models. The preclinical efficacy of similar NLRP3 inhibitors such as MCC950 in models of diabetic nephropathy, cisplatin-induced renal injury, and ischemia-reperfusion injury reinforces the therapeutic potential of targeting NLRP3 in kidney disease (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017).\n\nAnother significant strength of CY-09 is its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile in rodent studies, which is an important consideration for chronic administration required in CKD therapy (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). This pharmacokinetic profile, along with the compound’s high potency in inflammatory assays where nanomolar inhibitory effects have been observed, provides confidence that CY-09 could achieve therapeutically effective concentrations in the kidney without systemic toxicity.\n\nHowever, there are also challenges and uncertainties. Although extensive preclinical studies in inflammatory disease models support the potential of CY-09, direct evidence of its efficacy in chronic kidney disease models specifically remains limited. The majority of studies to date have focused on sepsis, metabolic disorders, and murine colitis rather than on kidney-specific outcomes. There is, therefore, a need for more targeted preclinical research in CKD models—including those mimicking diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and cisplatin-induced renal fibrosis—to definitively establish the renoprotective effects of CY-09 (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Additionally, while the mechanism is well-characterized in immune cells like macrophages, further studies need to elucidate its effects specifically in human proximal tubular epithelial cells and other renal cell types that contribute to CKD progression. Such studies should evaluate not only biochemical markers of inflammasome activation but also functional outcomes like proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate, and histological indices of fibrosis.\n\nAnother potential weakness concerns the translational gap between rodent models and human CKD. The pathophysiology of CKD is multifactorial, and while NLRP3-mediated inflammation is a key driver, the disease process involves many convergent signaling pathways including TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling and oxidative stress pathways. It is possible that the blockade of NLRP3 alone may not be sufficient to fully arrest disease progression in humans. In addition, although CY-09 appears selective based on current evidence, there is always the risk of off-target effects when a compound modulates ATPase activity, given the abundance of ATP-binding proteins in the cell. Careful profiling of CY-09 against a broad spectrum of other ATPases and kinases will be necessary to confirm its selectivity in a clinical setting (Sandall et al., 2020).\n\nIn summary, CY-09 represents an innovative and mechanistically compelling therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease due to its direct inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a central mediator of renal inflammation and fibrosis. Its synthesis as a thiazolidinone derivative and its proven ability to bind the Walker A motif within the NACHT domain underscore its potential to precisely block inflammasome-driven pyroptosis. Preclinical evidence from models of various inflammatory conditions, along with robust biochemical data demonstrating nanomolar potency in macrophage assays, provides a strong rationale for its repurposing in kidney disease. Furthermore, its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety in rodent studies enhance its translational appeal. Nonetheless, additional research is needed to specifically validate its efficacy in CKD models, assess its long-term safety, and determine its pharmacodynamic effects in kidney-specific cell types such as proximal tubular epithelial cells. Overall, the strengths of CY-09’s targeted mechanism, coupled with supportive preclinical efficacy data from related inflammatory models, make it a promising candidate for further development and evaluation in Chronic Kidney Disease (ClinicalTrials.gov; Jiang et al., 2017; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nBertinaria, M., Gastaldi, S., Marini, E., & Giorgis, M.

"(MCC950, 9)","(VX-765, 5)","Both candidates target inflammasome‐mediated pathways implicated in CKD, but they differ in target, evidence depth, and clinical maturity. VX-765 is a caspase-1 inhibitor whose active metabolite VRT-043198 blocks IL-1β/IL-18 maturation and pyroptosis. It benefits from Phase II human safety data (epilepsy, psoriasis) and oral bioavailability. Preclinical CKD models (diabetic nephropathy, UUO) show reductions in inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and fibrosis. However, clinical efficacy in CKD remains untested, and long-term caspase-1 blockade raises concerns about compensatory inflammatory circuits and potential impairment of host defense or tissue repair. MCC950 is a selective NLRP3 inhibitor that prevents ATP hydrolysis and inflammasome assembly upstream of caspase-1. Its mechanism is structurally elucidated (Walker B motif binding) and validated across multiple CKD models (diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, adenine-induced renal failure) with improvements in proteinuria, blood pressure, renal histology, and fibrosis. Safety data exist in non-human primates, but no completed human trials. MCC950’s target (NLRP3) is more upstream and may deliver broader suppression of inflammasome activation, while VX-765 inhibits only caspase-1 downstream. Both molecules are orally bioavailable and feasible for translational studies, but MCC950 has stronger, CKD-specific preclinical evidence, whereas VX-765 holds the advantage of established human safety in other indications.","While VX-765’s human safety database is valuable for repurposing, its preclinical CKD profile is limited to two models and targets caspase-1 downstream of NLRP3. This may leave upstream inflammasome activation unchecked and risks compensatory pathways. In contrast, MCC950 demonstrates consistent, robust efficacy across multiple CKD models with clear mechanistic validation of NLRP3 blockade. Its more upstream action should more effectively shut down pathological inflammasome signaling, translating into broader anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory benefits. Although human safety data are pending, its favorable primate profile and rational design support rapid progression. Accordingly, MCC950 is the stronger candidate for further development in CKD.",23,"(5, 9)","{'hypothesis': 'VX-765 (Belnacasan; InvivoGen, catalog #tlrl-vg765)', 'answer': 'Proposal for VX-765 (Belnacasan; InvivoGen, catalog #tlrl-vg765)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nVX-765 (Belnacasan) is an orally bioavailable small‐molecule prodrug that is metabolized in vivo to yield the active metabolite VRT-043198, a selective irreversible inhibitor of inflammatory caspase‐1. It belongs to the class of caspase-1 inhibitors, which are designed to target the proteolytic enzyme caspase‐1 responsible for the post-translational processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Originally discovered through efforts to identify small molecules that could modulate inflammasome-mediated inflammation, VX-765 was synthesized to covalently interact with the catalytic cysteine residue of caspase‐1 and thereby block its activity. This group of compounds is part of a broader category of anti-inflammatory agents that have been applied in conditions where excessive inflammasome activation leads to tissue damage, and they have been used in clinical studies for disorders such as epilepsy and psoriasis, demonstrating that this drug class can effectively modulate immune signaling pathways and cytokine maturation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nVX-765 has an established history in preclinical and early clinical research. It has advanced into Phase II trials in both epilepsy and psoriasis, conditions associated with chronic inflammation and abnormal cytokine signaling, thereby establishing a safety profile and demonstrating adequate target engagement in humans. Although it has not been widely evaluated in clinical trials specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), preclinical studies conducted in rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) have demonstrated that VX-765 effectively reduces markers of inflammation such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), diminishes macrophage infiltration, and reduces collagen deposition, which are indicative of reduced fibrotic remodeling in the kidney (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024). Additionally, the general class of caspase-1 inhibitors has been successfully applied in various inflammatory conditions, and mechanistic studies suggest that inhibiting caspase-1 can interrupt the cascade leading to pyroptotic cell death—a key factor in inflammatory tissue damage. Although there is no large-scale clinical trial data in CKD to date, the compound’s mechanism, coupled with existing human safety data from other indications, strongly supports its rapid repurposing potential for kidney diseases (Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nVX-765’s mechanism of action is centered on the selective inhibition of caspase-1, an essential enzyme involved in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, and in mediating a form of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that VX-765 is a prodrug that is metabolized into VRT-043198, which binds irreversibly to the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys285) in the active site of caspase-1 through covalent interactions. Structural analyses, including crystallography experiments, have elucidated that VRT-043198 makes additional hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with key residues (e.g., R179, Q283, P343, and R383) ensuring a high degree of selectivity for inflammatory caspases over apoptotic caspases (Yang, 2019). By blocking caspase-1, VX-765 prevents the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active cytokine forms, thereby reducing the release of these potent inflammatory mediators; it also prevents the cleavage of gasdermin D, a critical effector protein required to form membrane pores that mediate pyroptotic cell death. In renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and other cell types implicated in kidney disease, such proclivity for pyroptosis can drive local inflammatory cascades and fibrotic signaling, so inhibiting caspase-1 may mitigate these processes (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). The specificity of VX-765 for caspase-1 has been confirmed through both in vitro assays—with assessments of IL-1β release and gasdermin D cleavage—and in vivo models where administration of VX-765 led to reduced serum IL-1β, improved survival in sepsis models, and attenuation of inflammatory tissue injury (Yang, 2019; Liu et al., 2023).\n\nExpected Effect in Chronic Kidney Disease:  \nIn the context of Chronic Kidney Disease, particularly conditions characterized by diabetic nephropathy and renal fibrosis, the hypothesis is that VX-765 will reduce caspase-1 mediated pyroptosis and subsequent inflammatory cytokine release in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). TEC pyroptosis contributes to tubular cell death and triggers a deleterious inflammatory milieu that ultimately drives fibrotic remodeling through the activation of myofibroblasts and increased deposition of extracellular matrix components such as collagen. VX-765 is expected to block this cascade at an early step by preventing the activation of caspase-1, thereby limiting IL-1β and IL-18 maturation and secretion. This, in turn, should reduce the recruitment and activation of inflammatory macrophages—a process that has been shown to contribute to fibrogenesis in the kidney (Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Preclinical evidence from rodent models supports that administration of VX-765 leads to decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced expression of pro-fibrotic markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and a lower deposition of collagen, thereby preserving renal tubular structure and function. Considering caspase-1 and the inflammasome complex are expressed in renal cells including TECs and resident macrophages, targeting caspase-1 is a rational approach to interrupt the feedback loop between cell death and inflammation that exacerbates CKD progression (Zhou & Li, 2023; Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of VX-765 as a therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease include its well-defined mechanism of action, oral bioavailability, and the fact that it has already undergone Phase II clinical trials in other indications, demonstrating an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in humans. The mechanistic rationale is strong: by targeting caspase-1, VX-765 interrupts the inflammasome-driven cascade responsible for both pyroptotic cell death and the maturation of key pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in renal fibrosis. Preclinical models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction have provided promising evidence that caspase-1 inhibition can reduce renal inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and extracellular matrix deposition, suggesting that VX-765 might slow the progression of fibrotic changes in CKD (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). Furthermore, targeting a central mediator such as caspase-1 may have broader benefits by influencing several downstream inflammatory pathways simultaneously, thus potentially overcoming the limitations of therapies that target individual cytokines.  \nWeaknesses include the translational gap that currently exists between preclinical efficacy in rodent models and clinical benefit in human CKD patients. Although VX-765 has demonstrated safety in epilepsy and psoriasis trials, the long-term effects of inhibiting caspase-1 in a chronic disease setting like CKD are not fully understood, particularly given the complex roles that inflammasome signaling may play in tissue repair, host defense, and kidney homeostasis. There is also the possibility that fully inhibiting caspase-1 could lead to compensatory activation of alternative inflammatory pathways or unintended off-target effects, especially in patients with compromised kidney function. Additionally, while preclinical data are encouraging, there is a need for dedicated clinical trials in CKD and related fibrotic conditions to establish the optimal dosing, efficacy, and safety profile in this specific patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).  \nOverall, VX-765 exhibits several promising attributes as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for CKD: its defined molecular target, demonstrated anti-inflammatory mechanism through caspase-1 inhibition, and supportive preclinical evidence of renoprotection provide a compelling rationale for further investigation. The strengths of existing human safety data and oral administration combine with a robust mechanistic framework to justify advancing VX-765 into clinical trials in patients with CKD. Nonetheless, further research is required to clarify long-term effects on renal function, potential compensatory inflammatory mechanisms, and the detailed pharmacodynamics in the setting of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. With carefully designed clinical studies focusing on renal endpoints, VX-765 could represent a valuable addition to the therapeutic arsenal against CKD, particularly for patients whose disease is driven significantly by inflammasome-mediated inflammation and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

Glyburide was found to have anti‐inflammatory properties mediated by inhibition of the NLRP3 complex; however, its clinical utility as an anti-inflammatory agent was limited by its potent effects on insulin release and the consequent risk of hypoglycemia. To overcome these limitations, researchers refined the chemical structure and synthesized MCC950, a derivative that retains the inflammasome inhibitory activity of glyburide without disturbing insulin secretion. The design of MCC950 was based on structure–activity relationship studies that identified the importance of the diarylsulfonylurea moiety, and its eventual discovery positioned it as a gold-standard benchmark compound for NLRP3 inhibition (Kaur et al., 2025; Coll et al., 2019). This compound has been synthesized and purified by several vendors including Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #SML 2233), ensuring reproducibility and accessibility to research teams. Overall, MCC950 represents a promising example of rational drug design aimed at selectively targeting components of the innate immune system and addressing the inflammatory cascades that contribute to disease pathology.\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of MCC950 is marked by extensive preclinical evidence spanning animal models of a wide array of inflammatory disorders. Initially investigated in models of auto-inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, MCC950 quickly emerged as the benchmark inhibitor for studying NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated inflammation. In rodent models of kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, and adenine-induced chronic renal failure, MCC950 has demonstrated significant reductions in proteinuria, attenuated fibrosis, and improvements in overall renal function (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). Preclinical studies conducted in diabetic models have shown that chronic treatment with MCC950 leads to marked improvements in histopathological kidney damage, as evidenced by reduced mesangial expansion and decreased podocyte injury (Zhang et al., 2019). In addition, rodent studies in salt-sensitive hypertensive models reveal that inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome via MCC950 results in lower blood pressure, decreased interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, and reduced collagen deposition in renal tissues (Krishnan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2025). Although robust evidence from animal studies supports its efficacy in models of chronic kidney disease (CKD), clinical translation remains limited with only sparse early-phase clinical trials referenced in the literature (ClinicalTrials.gov). Additionally, the favorable safety profile observed in non-human primate studies further underpins its potential for repurposing in CKD, although more clinical data are needed to fully establish its benefit–risk profile.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nMCC950’s mechanism of action is both specific and well-characterized at the molecular level. The compound exerts its inhibitory effect by directly binding to the Walker B motif located within the NACHT domain of the NLRP3 protein. This binding interferes with the ATP hydrolysis that is essential for NLRP3 activation and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Under normal pathological conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC and the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form. Active caspase-1 then processes pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature forms and also initiates gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death. By preventing ATP hydrolysis, MCC950 locks NLRP3 in an inactive conformation, thereby obstructing the assembly of the entire inflammasome complex, reducing caspase-1 activation and cytokine maturation (Kim et al., 2019; Zhan et al., 2023). In the context of human tubular epithelial cells (TECs), which express NLRP3 and contribute to renal inflammatory cascades, MCC950’s engagement with the Walker B motif is proposed to significantly curb inflammasome formation. Such direct target engagement has been validated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and mutagenesis assays that confirm the drug’s specificity and potency. Blocking inflammasome assembly not only reduces cytokine release but also limits the formation of gasdermin D pores that are responsible for pyroptotic cell death, thereby preventing tubular cell loss and reducing interstitial inflammation (Liu et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven its robust preclinical evidence, the expected effect of MCC950 in assays focusing on CKD and related kidney injury is multifaceted. In in vitro models using human TECs, the hypothesis is that treatment with MCC950 will prevent ATP hydrolysis, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. As a result, the maturation and release of IL-1β and IL-18 will be significantly reduced, ultimately leading to lower levels of pyroptosis, attenuation of inflammation, and prevention of the fibrotic remodeling that often accompanies progressive CKD (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). In vivo, these effects are anticipated to manifest as decreased proteinuria, improved kidney function markers, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, and lower extracellular matrix deposition. This translates into a reduction in renal interstitial fibrosis and a preservation of normal tubular architecture, thereby ameliorating the progressive decline in renal function seen in CKD models. The expression profile of NLRP3 in TECs, coupled with its established role in mediating inflammatory and fibrotic responses, provides a solid rationale for targeting NLRP3 in chronic kidney disease (Zhang et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). The proposed mechanism is in alignment with the pathological features of CKD, where sustained low-grade inflammation and fibrosis lead to irreversible kidney damage.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nMCC950 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease due to several compelling strengths. First, its rational design as a selective NLRP3 inhibitor ensures that it directly targets a critical inflammatory pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of CKD. The extensive preclinical evidence in diverse animal models—from diabetic nephropathy to salt-sensitive hypertension and adenine-induced renal failure—strongly supports its renoprotective effects, including reductions in proteinuria, improved renal function, and diminished fibrotic remodeling (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Sabra et al., 2023). Second, the detailed elucidation of its molecular mechanism—confirming binding to the Walker B motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ATP hydrolysis—provides a clear mechanistic rationale that is essential for translational development (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Third, its favorable pharmacological properties, including oral bioavailability and a safety profile established in non-human primates, further underline its developmental feasibility (Kaur et al., 2025; ClinicalTrials.gov).  \n\nHowever, there are some potential weaknesses that must be carefully considered. Although rodent models have provided robust efficacy data, the translation of these effects to humans remains to be fully validated. There is a paucity of comprehensive clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with MCC950, which introduces uncertainty regarding its efficacy and potential off-target effects in a human patient population. Additionally, while the compound is highly selective for the NLRP3 inflammasome, it is critical to further elucidate its long-term safety and impact on global immune function, given the essential role of inflammasomes in host defense. In some experimental contexts, there has been variability in the inhibition of inflammation and fibrosis depending on the specific disease model, suggesting that its therapeutic window may differ based on disease etiology (Sabra et al., 2023). Despite these challenges, the overall evidence supports the further development of MCC950 as a mechanistic intervention in CKD, particularly in settings where inflammasome-driven pathology is predominant.\n\nIn summary, MCC950 is a well-characterized, rationally designed NLRP3 inhibitor with strong preclinical evidence demonstrating its renoprotective effects in various models of chronic kidney disease. Its specific binding to the Walker B motif of the NLRP3 NACHT domain and subsequent inhibition of ATP hydrolysis form the basis of its mechanism, reducing caspase-1 activation, IL-1β/IL-18 maturation, and gasdermin-D-mediated pyroptosis. These actions are expected to translate into reduced tubular epithelial cell death, diminished interstitial inflammation, and alleviation of fibrotic remodeling—key pathological processes in CKD progression. While further clinical validation is necessary, the strengths in mechanistic rationale, preclinical efficacy data, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties position MCC950 as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Coll et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022).\n\nReferences  \nColl, R.

"(OLT1177, 8)","(Disulfiram, 0)","Both candidates target inflammatory pathways implicated in chronic kidney disease (CKD), but differ in evidence depth, specificity, and translational readiness. Disulfiram (ID: 0) is a covalent ALDH inhibitor with newly discovered activity against gasdermin D (GSDMD), blocking pyroptosis by modifying a conserved cysteine. Its strengths include decades of human safety data, oral bioavailability, and preclinical efficacy in acute kidney injury (AKI) and sepsis models via inhibition of the caspase-11–GSDMD axis. However, direct studies in CKD or renal fibrosis models are lacking, and its thiol-reactive chemistry raises concerns about off-target covalent modifications and immune suppression with chronic use. Key unknowns include optimal dosing for sustained GSDMD inhibition in tubular epithelial cells, long-term toxicity in the renal context, and the balance between anti-inflammatory benefit and host defense. OLT1177 (Dapansutrile, ID: 8) selectively inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding the NACHT domain, preventing ASC recruitment and caspase-1 activation upstream of IL-1β/IL-18 release and pyroptosis. It has progressed through Phase I and Phase IIa trials in gout and heart failure with excellent safety and tolerability, and preclinical models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy show reduced renal IL-1β, macrophage infiltration, and fibrosis. Its mechanism is clearer, more specific, and directly validated in CKD-relevant settings. OLT1177’s oral bioavailability, defined PK/PD, and chronic dosing feasibility support its translational potential. While human CKD trials are pending, the robust preclinical CKD evidence, focused MoA, and established safety profile make OLT1177 a more compelling candidate for advancement in CKD therapy.","OLT1177 (ID: 8) outperforms Disulfiram (ID: 0) based on stronger and more directly relevant preclinical evidence in CKD models, a highly specific and upstream mechanism of action targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome, and demonstrated human safety and tolerability in clinical studies. Disulfiram’s promising activity in AKI and inflammatory models is offset by gaps in chronic kidney disease data, uncertainty around dosing and long-term off-target risks, and potential immune compromise from broad thiol reactivity. By contrast, OLT1177’s focused inflammasome inhibition addresses a central pathogenic driver of CKD, has defined PK/PD properties for chronic dosing, and carries less risk of pleiotropic toxicity, making it the superior candidate for translation into a viable CKD therapy.",24,"(0, 8)","{'hypothesis': 'Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nDisulfiram is a synthetic small‐molecule drug originally discovered more than seventy years ago and is well known for its unique chemical structure featuring a tetraethylthiuram disulfide core. It is typically synthesized via the oxidation of diethyldithiocarbamate salts derived from the reaction of carbon disulfide with diethylamine, producing a compound with a central disulfide bond that confers its thiol‐reactive properties (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13). Chemically, disulfiram belongs to the dithiocarbamate family and is classified pharmacologically as an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor. Historically, this inhibition of ALDH has been the molecular basis for its clinical application as an alcohol aversion agent, where disulfiram induces the accumulation of acetaldehyde following alcohol ingestion, causing an assortment of discomforting physiological effects such as flushing, nausea, and tachycardia (Lu et al., 2021, p. 12). More recently, however, disulfiram has assumed a new identity in drug repurposing initiatives; its ability to interact covalently with cysteine residues in target proteins – a consequence of its thiuram disulfide structure – has attracted considerable attention in the context of inflammatory diseases. In particular, its capacity to interfere with the function of gasdermin D (GSDMD) via covalent modification is emerging as a promising mechanism by which disulfiram could counteract pathological inflammatory pathways (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4). This newly recognized activity places disulfiram within a therapeutic class of established drugs that are being re‐evaluated beyond their original indications, seeking to exploit their long clinical history and known safety profiles for novel applications such as the modulation of pyroptosis in inflammatory pathologies like chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nDisulfiram has a long-established history, primarily being used in the management of chronic alcohol use disorder since its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the early 1950s. As a stand‐alone therapy, its effectiveness in producing a pronounced aversive reaction to ethanol intake has made it a mainstay in addiction medicine. Over the decades, disulfiram has been administered safely to vast numbers of patients – a fact that is of critical importance when considering repurposing efforts, as its pharmacokinetics, dosing parameters, and toxicity profiles are well documented (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3). In addition to its established role in alcohol abstinence, disulfiram has been repurposed for a number of other applications. Emerging investigations have highlighted its promising activity in malignancies, where disulfiram, often in conjunction with supplemental copper, has demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against cancer stem cells via mechanisms that involve proteasome inhibition and modulation of redox homeostasis (Lu et al., 2021, pp. 13–14; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). More recently, its anti-inflammatory potential has been explored in the context of infectious diseases and systemic inflammatory responses. For instance, disulfiram has been evaluated in sepsis models, where its inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis led to reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines and improved survival in animal models (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). In models of ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), disulfiram pretreatment was shown to ameliorate renal dysfunction and histological damage by suppressing the noncanonical caspase-11–GSDMD inflammatory axis (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6). Although direct clinical studies of disulfiram in chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis remain limited, the encouraging preclinical signals from acute kidney insults and its capacity to modulate cell death pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation suggest that disulfiram—and its metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate—might be effective in attenuating the injurious inflammatory cascades observed in CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, the repurposing hypothesis for disulfiram in chronic kidney disease centers on its recently identified inhibitory effect on gasdermin D (GSDMD), a pore-forming effector protein that is indispensable for the execution of pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory, lytic form of programmed cell death triggered by the activation of inflammasomes. When these multiprotein complexes form in response to pathogenic stimuli or sterile injury, they lead to the activation of inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1, and in noncanonical pathways, caspase-4/5/11. These enzymes cleave GSDMD to generate an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) that oligomerizes and inserts into the plasma membrane to form pores, thereby releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) into the extracellular milieu (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17). Disulfiram has been shown to block this crucial terminal step in pyroptosis by covalently modifying a conserved cysteine residue (Cys191 in human GSDMD and Cys192 in murine GSDMD) through a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. This chemical modification prevents the oligomerization and subsequent membrane pore formation by GSDMD, thereby directly inhibiting the execution phase of pyroptosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). Moreover, disulfiram’s activity is potentiated in the presence of copper ions, which may stabilize its reactive metabolites such as diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC), enhancing its inhibitory potency in cellular assays (Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18). The outcome of this inhibition is a significant reduction in the pyroptotic cell death cascade, as evidenced by decreased IL-1β release and overall attenuation of inflammatory signaling. In the context of the kidney, specifically within tubular epithelial cells (TECs), the inflammatory microenvironment driven by inflammasome activation is one of the critical factors in the progression from acute injury to chronic fibrosis. TECs are known to express inflammasome components and are susceptible to pyroptosis, which contributes to interstitial inflammation and fibrogenesis (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Therefore, by inhibiting the cleavage and activation of GSDMD in these cells, disulfiram has the potential to preserve tubular integrity and prevent the inflammatory cascade that ultimately drives chronic kidney injury.\n\nExpected Effect:  \nBased on the proposed hypothesis and data from related inflammatory and renal injury models, disulfiram is predicted to exert a protective effect in the setting of chronic kidney disease by targeting the final common pathway of pyroptotic cell death. In a typical in vitro assay using primary tubular epithelial cells or established TEC lines, treatment with disulfiram at concentrations within the non-cytotoxic range (e.g., 0.1–5 µM as indicated in hypoxia/reoxygenation models) is expected to prevent the formation of GSDMD pores, thereby reducing cell membrane disruption, limiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18), and preserving cell viability (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11). The expected molecular signature following disulfiram treatment would include decreased levels of cleaved (active) GSDMD, reduced caspase-11 activation along with lower concentrations of circulating cytokines, as well as preserved markers of epithelial cell integrity. Given that GSDMD and components of the inflammasome are expressed in tubular epithelial cells (as supported by studies focusing on renal inflammatory pathways; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 7–9; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 9–10), the inhibition of GSDMD pore formation directly addresses a mechanistic driver of tubular injury. This would translate into reduced interstitial inflammation and limited myofibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition, which are critical steps in the fibrotic process that underpins CKD progression (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Ultimately, the expectation is that a therapeutic regimen involving disulfiram may slow or even halt the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease by mitigating the damaging effects of pyroptosis.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nDisulfiram presents several attractive features as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. The strengths of disulfiram include:  \n1. A well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profile, supported by decades of clinical use in alcohol aversion therapy, which facilitates rapid translation into new clinical contexts (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Lu et al., 2021, p. 12).  \n2. A clear and innovative mechanism of action based on the inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis. This mechanism is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of CKD, where inflammasome activation and resultant pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells contribute to interstitial inflammation and fibrosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11).  \n3. The potential for its active metabolite, diethyldithiocarbamate, and the enhancing role of copper complexation to improve its potency as a pyroptosis inhibitor further bolster the therapeutic rationale (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18; Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34).  \n4. Preclinical evidence in models of acute kidney injury (ischemia-reperfusion injury) demonstrates that disulfiram can ameliorate renal dysfunction through inhibition of the caspase-11–GSDMD axis, suggesting that similar effects may be achieved in chronic inflammatory settings underlying CKD (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11).  \n\nHowever, there are also potential weaknesses and gaps that warrant further exploration:  \n1. Despite promising preclinical data in acute injury models and other inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, direct evidence of disulfiram’s efficacy in chronic kidney disease models remains limited. The available studies do not present long-term data specific to CKD or renal fibrosis, which is critical for validating its use in a chronic condition (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6).  \n2. While the mechanism of covalent modification of GSDMD at Cys191 is well supported by molecular studies, the extrapolation of these findings to tubular epithelial cells in the kidney (as opposed to macrophages or other inflammatory cells) requires additional confirmation. It is essential to verify that TECs exhibit similar susceptibility to the gasdermin D inhibitory effects of disulfiram under pathological conditions (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n3. Dosage optimization, chronic toxicity assessments, and potential off-target effects in the renal context have not yet been extensively characterized. Although the historical human use of disulfiram supports a favorable safety profile, the dosing regimen for CKD might differ from that used for alcohol aversion therapy, given the distinct pharmacodynamics required to inhibit pyroptosis in kidney tissues (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8).  \n4. Another consideration is the effect of systemic modulation of pyroptosis. Since pyroptosis is integral to effective immune responses under certain circumstances, indiscriminate long-term inhibition could potentially compromise host defenses against infections. This balance between therapeutic efficacy in CKD and preservation of necessary immune functions must be carefully evaluated in preclinical models and eventually in clinical trials (Hu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n\nIn summary, disulfiram emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease due to its novel mechanism of targeting gasdermin D-induced pyroptosis—a pathway that is increasingly recognized as a critical driver of renal inflammation and fibrogenesis. Its long clinical history, established oral bioavailability, and well-characterized safety profile offer substantial advantages that could accelerate its translation into CKD-focused studies. The evidence from acute kidney injury models and inflammatory disease research forms a strong mechanistic rationale for its use to preserve tubular epithelial integrity and mitigate interstitial inflammation. Nevertheless, further detailed studies are imperative to validate its effectiveness in chronic kidney models, delineate optimal dosing strategies, and ensure that the inhibition of pyroptosis does not adversely affect normal immune surveillance. Based on the data reviewed—from biochemical studies demonstrating covalent modification of GSDMD (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8) to preclinical studies in renal injury models (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6)—the overall evaluation supports continued investigation of disulfiram as a repurposed agent in CKD. Its potential to modulate a critical pathogenic pathway in chronic kidney injury could represent a novel therapeutic intervention that merits further preclinical and clinical development (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18).\n\nReferences  \nCai, Q., Sun, Z., Xu, S., Jiao, X., Guo, S., Li, Y., Wu, H., & Yu, X.

The compound was synthesized via a chemically directed approach—in particular, its synthesis involved an alkylation reaction of sodium methanesulfinate with 3-bromopropionitrile, yielding a β-sulfonyl nitrile moiety that confers its inhibitory activity (Marchetti et al., 2018). This class of small molecule inhibitors has been widely explored for targeting inflammatory pathways through modulation of innate immune responses. Historically, β-sulfonyl nitrile compounds have attracted attention as therapeutic agents due to their capacity to engage key protein domains involved in inflammation while maintaining selectivity and oral bioavailability, attributes that are critical for chronic treatment regimens (Marchetti et al., 2018).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOLT1177 has progressed through several stages of development and clinical evaluation in diseases characterized by uncontrolled inflammation, notably in acute gout flares, heart failure, and conditions linked to cytokine release syndromes. In Phase I clinical trials, dapansutrile demonstrated an excellent safety profile when administered to healthy subjects at dosages up to 1000 mg per day for 8 days, thereby establishing its tolerability and preliminary evidence of target engagement (Jansen et al., 2019). Moreover, therapeutic evaluations in inflammatory settings—such as a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study in patients with NYHA II–III systolic heart failure—further underscored its favorable safety profile and pharmacodynamic effects despite the fact that current clinical investigations have not directly targeted Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) populations (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical studies in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy have demonstrated that treatment with OLT1177 leads to significant reductions in renal IL-1β levels, decreased macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis, suggesting that its benefits extend to kidney-related inflammatory damage (Mulay, 2019). Although clinical trials specifically focused on CKD or renal inflammation are lacking at this point, the robust anti-inflammatory effects observed in related models and conditions provide a sound rationale for repurposing OLT1177 in chronic kidney disease.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, OLT1177 selectively inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by targeting its central NACHT domain, where it interferes with ATPase activity that is critical for the oligomerization process necessary for inflammasome assembly. Under normal conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggers the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), leading to the formation of a multi-protein complex that activates caspase-1 and drives the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) (Kim et al., 2019). OLT1177 binds specifically to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, thereby blocking the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC, which is a necessary event for full inflammasome assembly (Marchetti et al., 2018). In doing so, it prevents the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-1 and effectively reduces the secretion of IL-1β. This mechanism is particularly significant in environments of hyperglycemic stress, where increased NLRP3 activity in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) drives inflammation, pyroptotic cell death, and subsequent tubulointerstitial fibrosis (Mulay, 2019). Additionally, by curtailing downstream cytokine release and pyroptosis, OLT1177 is believed to mitigate the metabolic cost of inflammation, an effect that has been observed in multiple preclinical in vivo studies in conditions ranging from acute arthritis to cardiac dysfunction (Jansen et al., 2019; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe central hypothesis is that through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, OLT1177 will effectively block the recruitment of ASC and disrupt subsequent caspase-1 activation in renal tubular cells, particularly under conditions of hyperglycemia which are common in diabetic nephropathy. Under hyperglycemic stress, renal tubular epithelial cells exhibit increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and aberrant inflammasome activation resulting in heightened secretion of IL-1β, a cytokine implicated in promoting fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition. By preventing the cleavage of pro-IL-1β into its active form, OLT1177 is expected to prevent pyroptotic cell death of TECs and interrupt the deleterious cycle of inflammation-driven fibrogenesis in the kidney (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Evidence from animal models indicates that selective blockade of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to a marked decrease in renal inflammation as evidenced by reduced macrophage infiltration and lower profibrotic cytokine levels, which supports the expectation that OLT1177 could yield appreciable renoprotective outcomes in CKD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In the proposed assay, it is anticipated that OLT1177 will reduce markers of inflammation such as IL-1β and IL-18 in the culture medium of hyperglycemia-stressed TECs, thereby correlating with decreased pyroptosis and improved cell viability. This would be further corroborated by downstream effects such as reduced activation of profibrotic pathways, including lower TGF-β signaling and diminished deposition of fibrotic markers, ultimately mitigating the progression toward renal fibrosis (Cliff, 2023; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate with substantial potential for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease owing to its well-characterized mechanism of action, favorable preclinical results, and established safety profile in early clinical studies. One of the major strengths of OLT1177 lies in its selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an attractive target given the critical role of NLRP3 in mediating renal inflammation, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenesis. Its synthetic origins and robust medicinal chemistry underpin its precise targeting of the NACHT domain in NLRP3, effectively sparing other inflammasomes and reducing the risk of broad immunosuppression (Marchetti et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Furthermore, its oral bioavailability and metabolic stability make it suitable for chronic administration, an essential consideration for CKD where long-term therapy is required (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nFrom a therapeutic history perspective, although OLT1177 has not yet been directly tested in human CKD patient populations, its successful progression through Phase I trials for conditions such as gout and heart failure, combined with promising data in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy, strongly supports its potential utility in renal settings (Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Preclinical studies show reduced renal IL-1β secretion, diminished macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis when NLRP3 is inhibited by agents like OLT1177, lending biological credence to the hypothesis that inflammasome inhibition could slow CKD progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nAt the molecular level, the precise action of OLT1177—binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ASC recruitment—represents a highly targeted approach that contrasts with cytokine-neutralizing therapies such as anti-IL-1β antibodies. This specificity is advantageous because it not only prevents the generation of IL-1β but also curtails the activation of NFκB and other downstream inflammatory cascades, potentially reducing off-target effects and preserving broader immune competence (Marchetti et al., 2018; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020). Additionally, the expected anti-inflammatory effects in renal tubular cells—specifically preventing pyroptosis and fibrogenesis—are consistent with literature demonstrating that NLRP3 is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells under hyperglycemic and inflammatory stress (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain. One of the limitations stems from the current lack of direct clinical evidence in CKD populations; while animal models provide a strong rationale, the translation of these findings into human CKD may be complicated by the multifactorial nature of the disease, where multiple pathways contribute to renal injury beyond inflammasome activation. Additionally, the chronic nature of CKD necessitates prolonged administration of therapeutic agents, and long-term safety data for OLT1177 in such a setting are still pending. There is also the possibility that inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome might impair necessary innate immune responses, although the specificity of OLT1177 for the NLRP3 complex—in contrast to more generalized anti-inflammatory agents—should, in theory, mitigate this concern (Seok et al., 2021).\n\nMoreover, while the preclinical data in models of diabetic nephropathy and crystal-induced kidney injury are promising, variability in genetic and environmental factors in human CKD could affect the compound’s efficacy. It will therefore be critical to design dedicated clinical trials in defined CKD populations, ideally incorporating biomarkers of inflammasome activity, such as circulating IL-1β and IL-18 levels, as well as imaging and functional assessments of renal fibrosis and function. The anti-fibrotic effects, in particular, warrant closer mechanistic studies to confirm that inhibition of TEC pyroptosis and preservation of tubular integrity occur in the human kidney as they do in animal models (Williams et al., 2022; Cliff, 2023).\n\nIn conclusion, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) represents a compelling candidate for repurposing in Chronic Kidney Disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, favorable pharmacological profile, and preclinical evidence supporting its renoprotective effects. Its ability to directly inhibit the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding to the NACHT domain and blocking ASC recruitment addresses a critical upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that leads to caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and subsequent pyroptosis of renal tubular cells. This mode of action has the potential to attenuate the inflammation-driven fibrogenesis that is central to CKD progression, particularly in diabetic nephropathy where hyperglycemic stress is a key driver of renal injury.\n\nStrengths of OLT1177 include its synthetic origin allowing for structural optimization, its demonstrated safety in Phase I clinical trials, its oral bioavailability which is advantageous for chronic therapy, and its selective inhibitory action that minimizes off-target effects. Additionally, existing preclinical studies showing reduced renal IL-1β, diminished macrophage infiltration, and lowered fibrotic responses in models of nephropathy provide a promising foundation for further exploration in CKD (Mulay, 2019; Jansen et al., 2019).\n\nWeaknesses or challenges include the current absence of dedicated clinical trials in CKD, the complexity of CKD pathophysiology where multiple inflammatory and fibrotic pathways are involved, and the potential risk that chronic inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome could in some contexts compromise the host defense or alter essential cellular processes. These concerns underscore the need for carefully designed preclinical studies specifically in renal disease models, followed by early phase clinical trials in well-defined CKD populations to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and long-term safety.\n\nOverall, based on the comprehensive literature review, the mechanistic rationale, and the encouraging preclinical and early clinical data available, OLT1177 shows significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease. The next steps should involve further detailed studies in CKD-specific preclinical models that assess not only inflammatory cytokine modulation but also functional outcomes such as glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria reduction, and fibrosis attenuation. A robust clinical development program targeting patients with diabetic nephropathy and other forms of CKD characterized by inflammasome activation would be the logical progression to validate its clinical utility (Marchetti et al., 2018; Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nReferences  \nCliff, C.

"(MCC950, 9)","(A-438079, 2)","Both candidates target inflammasome-driven pathways implicated in chronic kidney disease (CKD), but differ in evidence depth and translational readiness. A-438079 is a potent, selective P2X7 receptor antagonist with strong mechanistic rationale: blocking ATP-induced K+ efflux upstream of NLRP3 activation. It shows efficacy in acute kidney injury (cisplatin nephrotoxicity, ischemia-reperfusion, sepsis models) and reduces IL-1β and IL-18 release. However, direct evidence in chronic models of CKD is limited, and species-dependent compensatory pathways (e.g., angiotensin II models) challenge its universal relevance. P2X7 antagonists have seen mixed outcomes in clinical trials for inflammatory diseases, and long-term safety in CKD remains underexplored. MCC950 is a diarylsulfonylurea NLRP3 inhibitor that directly binds the Walker B motif, preventing ATP hydrolysis, inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, cytokine maturation, and gasdermin-D-mediated pyroptosis. It has extensive preclinical validation in multiple CKD models (diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, adenine-induced renal failure) demonstrating reductions in proteinuria, inflammation, fibrosis, and improved renal function. Safety data in non-human primates show good tolerability and oral bioavailability, and the mechanism is highly specific. Although early clinical data in CKD are sparse, the breadth of mechanistic insight, direct CKD model efficacy, and favorable safety profile signal higher translational potential for MCC950 compared to A-438079.","MCC950 outperforms A-438079 based on the strength and relevance of evidence: direct, robust efficacy in diverse chronic kidney disease models versus mostly acute injury paradigms. MCC950’s mechanism is clear, direct, and central to CKD pathology, targeting NLRP3 itself rather than an upstream receptor subject to redundancy. Its safety and PK/PD profile are better characterized, including non-human primate data and demonstrated oral bioavailability. Conversely, A-438079’s translational risk is higher due to mixed preclinical outcomes in CKD-relevant settings, lack of direct CKD model validation, and uncertain human efficacy. While both approaches are novel, MCC950 combines scientific novelty with stronger evidence and a clearer path toward clinical translation in CKD.",25,"(2, 9)","{'hypothesis': 'A-438079 (Tocris, catalog #2947)', 'answer': 'Proposal for A-438079 (Tocris, catalog #2947)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nA-438079 is a synthetic small‐molecule antagonist originally developed as a selective inhibitor of the P2X7 receptor, a ligand‐gated ion channel known to be activated by high concentrations of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The compound belongs to a class of agents that includes disubstituted tetrazoles and cyanoguanidine derivatives, which have been characterized by their ability to selectively block P2X7 receptor activation without significantly affecting other P2X subtypes. Its design and synthesis were initially achieved by pharmaceutical research groups (notably Abbott Laboratories as indicated in early publications) and have since been commercialized by companies such as Tocris (catalog #2947). This class of compounds was originally optimized for studies in inflammatory processes and pain models, as they inhibit ATP‐induced ion flux such as calcium influx and potassium efflux, a key factor in the activation cascade of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nBiochemically and pharmacologically, A-438079 has been investigated in various preclinical models for its ability to mitigate inflammation. It has demonstrated efficacy in rodent models of neuropathic pain and inflammatory conditions by inhibiting P2X7-mediated IL-1β release. In terms of renal applications, there is evidence from several studies that selective P2X7 antagonism can protect against kidney insults such as ischemia-reperfusion injury and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. For example, Zhang et al. (2014) showed that blocking P2X7 with antagonists like A-438079 attenuated cisplatin-induced renal tubular damage by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis markers in mice (Zhang et al., 2014). Additionally, studies such as those by Arulkumaran (2016) and colleagues have demonstrated that while genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of P2X7 in some models does not always equate to improved renal function, the block of P2X7-related signaling reduces inflammasome activation and cytokine release in immune cells and tubular epithelium (Arulkumaran, 2016; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Even though A-438079 has not been widely tested clinically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), its pharmacological profile as a P2X7 antagonist has been well characterized in biochemical studies and preclinical kidney injury models. This builds an indirect but strong rationale for repurposing it in CKD contexts, where sustained inflammation and fibrosis are major pathogenic drivers (Birch et al., 2013; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe primary mechanism of A-438079 is its high-affinity, selective antagonism of the P2X7 receptor. The P2X7 receptor is unique among the P2X family in its requirement for high concentrations of ATP, which are typically achieved in pathological conditions involving cell injury and inflammation. Under normal conditions, extracellular ATP levels are low; however, during tissue damage, ATP is released into the extracellular space where it binds to and activates P2X7 receptors expressed on immune cells (especially macrophages) and renal tubular epithelial cells (Han et al., 2020; Howarth, 2020).  \n\nUpon binding of ATP to the receptor, P2X7 undergoes a conformational change that opens its ion channel, permitting the influx of calcium ions and the efflux of potassium ions. This potassium efflux is a critical upstream event that triggers the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex responsible for activating caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 then cleaves the precursors of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature, secreted forms. These cytokines play major roles in propagating inflammatory signals, inducing pyroptosis (a form of inflammatory cell death), and promoting fibrotic remodeling in affected tissues (Qian et al., 2021; Shokoples, 2022).\n\nA-438079 interacts with the P2X7 receptor by competitively inhibiting ATP binding, thereby preventing the channel’s conformational change and subsequent ion flux. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) is approximately 40 nM in rodent models, indicating high potency (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). By blocking this pathway, A-438079 inhibits downstream events including NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 cleavage, and the release of IL-1β, ultimately reducing inflammatory responses and preventing the activation of fibrotic signaling pathways in kidney tissue, particularly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells where P2X7 and NLRP3 are highly expressed (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the context of chronic kidney disease, the principal pathological mechanisms include persistent inflammation and fibrosis, processes that are significantly driven by inflammasome activation in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. The hypothesis postulates that A-438079 will block ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor in these cell types. By doing so, it prevents the crucial potassium efflux that is necessary for the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The expected downstream effects include a reduction in caspase-1 activation, decreased cleavage of pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β, and ultimately lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This chain of events is anticipated to reduce pyroptosis and curb the progression of fibrosis within the kidney (Qian et al., 2021; Arulkumaran et al., 2018).\n\nRenal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells are known to express both the P2X7 receptor and NLRP3, as evidenced by various studies outlining their roles in mediating inflammation-driven fibrosis in CKD (Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020). In assays, it is expected that treatment with A-438079 would result in a measurable decrease in IL-1β release, reduced markers of inflammation such as caspase-1 activity, and potentially lower expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components. Furthermore, by blunting chronic inflammatory responses, A-438079 may help to preserve kidney structure and function, thereby slowing the progression of CKD. The compound’s favorable pharmacokinetic properties—particularly its demonstrated bioavailability and minimal off-target effects—support the feasibility of achieving these outcomes (Burnstock, 2017).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nA-438079 presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on several factors. One of its major strengths lies in its selectivity and potency as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, which allows it to precisely target an upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that is centrally implicated in CKD. The ability of A-438079 to block ATP-induced ion flux is particularly compelling because it interrupts the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a known driver of IL-1β and IL-18 release in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells (Arulkumaran, 2016; Qian et al., 2021). This molecular specificity holds promise for reducing inflammation and subsequent fibrotic formation in the kidney, both of which are critical elements in CKD progression.\n\nThe preclinical evidence supporting the use of P2X7 antagonists in models of acute kidney injury, such as cisplatin nephrotoxicity and sepsis-induced renal injury, provides additional rationale, even though such models are not perfect surrogates for CKD (Zhang et al., 2014; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Some studies have demonstrated that selective P2X7 blockade can attenuate inflammatory cytokine production, improve renal function markers, and reduce cell death, thereby supporting the hypothesis that similar benefits could be realized in chronic inflammatory settings like CKD (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nAdditionally, the mechanistic details of P2X7 receptor signaling – requiring high extracellular ATP concentrations, initiating K+ efflux, and triggering inflammasome assembly – align closely with the known processes of renal inflammation and fibrosis. The fact that P2X7 and NLRP3 are co-expressed in key renal cell populations reinforces the logic behind using A-438079 to target these pathways (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and potential challenges that need to be considered. Firstly, in some preclinical models, especially in certain rat strains (as noted by studies involving P2X7 receptor knockout rats), the inhibition or deletion of P2X7 did not significantly alter renal function or prevent kidney injury induced by hypertensive factors such as angiotensin II (Nespoux et al., 2024). This suggests that compensatory pathways may exist, and the role of P2X7 might be context-dependent or vary among species. Secondly, clinical trials of P2X7 antagonists in other inflammatory diseases have had mixed outcomes, raising concerns about translational efficacy in human CKD (Luz et al., 2019). Moreover, while the mechanism of inflammasome inhibition is well understood in vitro, the in vivo pharmacodynamics in the kidney may be complicated by variable local ATP concentrations and the dynamic expression of the receptor in disease states.\n\nFrom a drug development standpoint, the potency (IC50 ~40 nM) and reported good bioavailability of A-438079 are advantageous. Its minimal off-target effects also reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions in clinical translation. However, more robust and specific data in CKD models are necessary to establish whether the attenuation of IL-1β release can consistently translate into meaningful improvements in renal fibrosis and overall kidney function over long-term treatment courses (Chen et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2024).\n\nIn summary, A-438079’s targeted inhibition of the P2X7 receptor offers a novel approach to halt the ATP-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby mitigating a key upstream trigger of inflammatory cascades in CKD. Its preclinical track record in inflammatory and renal injury models, combined with its mechanistic specificity, positions it as a strong candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease. Nonetheless, species variability, redundant inflammatory pathways, and the need for further in vivo validation in models of long-term kidney disease remain potential hurdles. If these challenges are addressed in further preclinical and early clinical studies, A-438079 could represent a significant advance in targeting the inflammation-fibrosis axis in CKD (Arulkumaran et al., 2018; Fantauzzi, 2013; Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe strengths of A-438079 for CKD include its high potency, selectivity, and well-elucidated mechanism of action in blocking ATP-induced P2X7 receptor activation—a critical initiator of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. These molecular interactions have been robustly characterized in multiple preclinical studies, indicating that the drug may effectively reduce IL-1β-mediated inflammation and subsequent fibrotic responses. In models of acute renal injury, antagonizing P2X7 has led to reduced cell death and improved renal function, which supports its potential usage in CKD where chronic inflammation is a driver of progressive fibrosis. Moreover, the chemical class to which A-438079 belongs has been extensively employed in studies of inflammatory diseases, reinforcing the feasibility of this approach (Deplano, 2012; Qian et al., 2021).\n\nConversely, potential weaknesses lie in the heterogeneity of experimental outcomes across different preclinical models and species. Some studies have shown that genetic deletion of P2X7 in rats does not always confer renal protection in induced kidney injury, suggesting that the pathophysiology in certain species—or even specific CKD etiologies—may be driven by redundant pathways beyond P2X7/NLRP3. In addition, although A-438079 demonstrates promising in vitro efficacy, there remains a critical need for long-term in vivo studies specifically in CKD models to verify that its anti-inflammatory effects translate into clinically meaningful outcomes in terms of preservation of renal function and reduction in fibrosis. Lastly, it is important to consider potential compensatory mechanisms in chronic inflammation that may limit the sole efficacy of P2X7 inhibition (Nespoux et al., 2024; Luz et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, A-438079 is a scientifically compelling therapeutic candidate for CKD, with robust mechanistic support and significant preclinical evidence in inflammatory models. Its ability to target the P2X7/NLRP3 axis addresses a novel therapeutic area in CKD by potentially halting the progression of inflammation-driven fibrosis. However, potential limitations due to species-specific responses and redundancy in inflammatory signaling must be carefully evaluated in future studies. Overall, A-438079 merits further investigation as part of a multi-pronged approach to modulate inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in chronic kidney disease (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:  \nArulkumaran, N.

It belongs to the diarylsulfonylurea class of compounds, which emerged from medicinal chemistry efforts that initially focused on sulfonylurea drugs such as glyburide. Glyburide was found to have anti‐inflammatory properties mediated by inhibition of the NLRP3 complex; however, its clinical utility as an anti-inflammatory agent was limited by its potent effects on insulin release and the consequent risk of hypoglycemia. To overcome these limitations, researchers refined the chemical structure and synthesized MCC950, a derivative that retains the inflammasome inhibitory activity of glyburide without disturbing insulin secretion. The design of MCC950 was based on structure–activity relationship studies that identified the importance of the diarylsulfonylurea moiety, and its eventual discovery positioned it as a gold-standard benchmark compound for NLRP3 inhibition (Kaur et al., 2025; Coll et al., 2019). This compound has been synthesized and purified by several vendors including Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #SML 2233), ensuring reproducibility and accessibility to research teams. Overall, MCC950 represents a promising example of rational drug design aimed at selectively targeting components of the innate immune system and addressing the inflammatory cascades that contribute to disease pathology.\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of MCC950 is marked by extensive preclinical evidence spanning animal models of a wide array of inflammatory disorders. Initially investigated in models of auto-inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, MCC950 quickly emerged as the benchmark inhibitor for studying NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated inflammation. In rodent models of kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, and adenine-induced chronic renal failure, MCC950 has demonstrated significant reductions in proteinuria, attenuated fibrosis, and improvements in overall renal function (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). Preclinical studies conducted in diabetic models have shown that chronic treatment with MCC950 leads to marked improvements in histopathological kidney damage, as evidenced by reduced mesangial expansion and decreased podocyte injury (Zhang et al., 2019). In addition, rodent studies in salt-sensitive hypertensive models reveal that inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome via MCC950 results in lower blood pressure, decreased interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, and reduced collagen deposition in renal tissues (Krishnan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2025). Although robust evidence from animal studies supports its efficacy in models of chronic kidney disease (CKD), clinical translation remains limited with only sparse early-phase clinical trials referenced in the literature (ClinicalTrials.gov). Additionally, the favorable safety profile observed in non-human primate studies further underpins its potential for repurposing in CKD, although more clinical data are needed to fully establish its benefit–risk profile.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nMCC950’s mechanism of action is both specific and well-characterized at the molecular level. The compound exerts its inhibitory effect by directly binding to the Walker B motif located within the NACHT domain of the NLRP3 protein. This binding interferes with the ATP hydrolysis that is essential for NLRP3 activation and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Under normal pathological conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC and the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form. Active caspase-1 then processes pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature forms and also initiates gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death. By preventing ATP hydrolysis, MCC950 locks NLRP3 in an inactive conformation, thereby obstructing the assembly of the entire inflammasome complex, reducing caspase-1 activation and cytokine maturation (Kim et al., 2019; Zhan et al., 2023). In the context of human tubular epithelial cells (TECs), which express NLRP3 and contribute to renal inflammatory cascades, MCC950’s engagement with the Walker B motif is proposed to significantly curb inflammasome formation. Such direct target engagement has been validated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and mutagenesis assays that confirm the drug’s specificity and potency. Blocking inflammasome assembly not only reduces cytokine release but also limits the formation of gasdermin D pores that are responsible for pyroptotic cell death, thereby preventing tubular cell loss and reducing interstitial inflammation (Liu et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven its robust preclinical evidence, the expected effect of MCC950 in assays focusing on CKD and related kidney injury is multifaceted. In in vitro models using human TECs, the hypothesis is that treatment with MCC950 will prevent ATP hydrolysis, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. As a result, the maturation and release of IL-1β and IL-18 will be significantly reduced, ultimately leading to lower levels of pyroptosis, attenuation of inflammation, and prevention of the fibrotic remodeling that often accompanies progressive CKD (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). In vivo, these effects are anticipated to manifest as decreased proteinuria, improved kidney function markers, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, and lower extracellular matrix deposition. This translates into a reduction in renal interstitial fibrosis and a preservation of normal tubular architecture, thereby ameliorating the progressive decline in renal function seen in CKD models. The expression profile of NLRP3 in TECs, coupled with its established role in mediating inflammatory and fibrotic responses, provides a solid rationale for targeting NLRP3 in chronic kidney disease (Zhang et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). The proposed mechanism is in alignment with the pathological features of CKD, where sustained low-grade inflammation and fibrosis lead to irreversible kidney damage.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nMCC950 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease due to several compelling strengths. First, its rational design as a selective NLRP3 inhibitor ensures that it directly targets a critical inflammatory pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of CKD. The extensive preclinical evidence in diverse animal models—from diabetic nephropathy to salt-sensitive hypertension and adenine-induced renal failure—strongly supports its renoprotective effects, including reductions in proteinuria, improved renal function, and diminished fibrotic remodeling (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Sabra et al., 2023). Second, the detailed elucidation of its molecular mechanism—confirming binding to the Walker B motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ATP hydrolysis—provides a clear mechanistic rationale that is essential for translational development (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Third, its favorable pharmacological properties, including oral bioavailability and a safety profile established in non-human primates, further underline its developmental feasibility (Kaur et al., 2025; ClinicalTrials.gov).  \n\nHowever, there are some potential weaknesses that must be carefully considered. Although rodent models have provided robust efficacy data, the translation of these effects to humans remains to be fully validated. There is a paucity of comprehensive clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with MCC950, which introduces uncertainty regarding its efficacy and potential off-target effects in a human patient population. Additionally, while the compound is highly selective for the NLRP3 inflammasome, it is critical to further elucidate its long-term safety and impact on global immune function, given the essential role of inflammasomes in host defense. In some experimental contexts, there has been variability in the inhibition of inflammation and fibrosis depending on the specific disease model, suggesting that its therapeutic window may differ based on disease etiology (Sabra et al., 2023). Despite these challenges, the overall evidence supports the further development of MCC950 as a mechanistic intervention in CKD, particularly in settings where inflammasome-driven pathology is predominant.\n\nIn summary, MCC950 is a well-characterized, rationally designed NLRP3 inhibitor with strong preclinical evidence demonstrating its renoprotective effects in various models of chronic kidney disease. Its specific binding to the Walker B motif of the NLRP3 NACHT domain and subsequent inhibition of ATP hydrolysis form the basis of its mechanism, reducing caspase-1 activation, IL-1β/IL-18 maturation, and gasdermin-D-mediated pyroptosis. These actions are expected to translate into reduced tubular epithelial cell death, diminished interstitial inflammation, and alleviation of fibrotic remodeling—key pathological processes in CKD progression. While further clinical validation is necessary, the strengths in mechanistic rationale, preclinical efficacy data, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties position MCC950 as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Coll et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022).\n\nReferences  \nColl, R.

"(Disulfiram, 0)","(A-438079, 2)","Both candidates target inflammasome-driven pathways implicated in CKD progression, but their supporting evidence, translational readiness, and risk/benefit profiles differ. Candidate 0 (Disulfiram) leverages a well‐described mechanism—covalent inhibition of GSDMD—directly blocking pyroptosis, a process documented in tubular epithelial cells and central to inflammation‐fibrosis transition. Multiple in vivo AKI models (ischemia–reperfusion, sepsis) show improved renal function, and decades of human use establish safety, PK, oral bioavailability, and dosing parameters. Key gaps are the absence of long‐term CKD or fibrosis models and potential off‐target thiol reactivity affecting host defense. Candidate 2 (A-438079) is a potent, selective P2X7 antagonist that blocks upstream NLRP3 inflammasome assembly by preventing K+ efflux. Preclinical AKI and nephrotoxicity models demonstrate reduced IL-1β release and tubular injury. However, evidence in chronic or fibrosis‐driving kidney disease is limited; some genetic knockout studies showed no protection, suggesting species or context dependency. A-438079 remains a research tool with no established human safety or PK in CKD, and its translational path faces uncertain formulation and clinical development hurdles.","Disulfiram (ID 0) offers stronger translational potential due to: (1) a direct, well‐validated MoA against GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in renal epithelial cells; (2) robust in vivo efficacy in kidney injury models; (3) an established clinical safety and PK profile; and (4) oral bioavailability enabling rapid repurposing.

It is typically synthesized via the oxidation of diethyldithiocarbamate salts derived from the reaction of carbon disulfide with diethylamine, producing a compound with a central disulfide bond that confers its thiol‐reactive properties (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13). Chemically, disulfiram belongs to the dithiocarbamate family and is classified pharmacologically as an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor. Historically, this inhibition of ALDH has been the molecular basis for its clinical application as an alcohol aversion agent, where disulfiram induces the accumulation of acetaldehyde following alcohol ingestion, causing an assortment of discomforting physiological effects such as flushing, nausea, and tachycardia (Lu et al., 2021, p. 12). More recently, however, disulfiram has assumed a new identity in drug repurposing initiatives; its ability to interact covalently with cysteine residues in target proteins – a consequence of its thiuram disulfide structure – has attracted considerable attention in the context of inflammatory diseases. In particular, its capacity to interfere with the function of gasdermin D (GSDMD) via covalent modification is emerging as a promising mechanism by which disulfiram could counteract pathological inflammatory pathways (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4). This newly recognized activity places disulfiram within a therapeutic class of established drugs that are being re‐evaluated beyond their original indications, seeking to exploit their long clinical history and known safety profiles for novel applications such as the modulation of pyroptosis in inflammatory pathologies like chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nDisulfiram has a long-established history, primarily being used in the management of chronic alcohol use disorder since its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the early 1950s. As a stand‐alone therapy, its effectiveness in producing a pronounced aversive reaction to ethanol intake has made it a mainstay in addiction medicine. Over the decades, disulfiram has been administered safely to vast numbers of patients – a fact that is of critical importance when considering repurposing efforts, as its pharmacokinetics, dosing parameters, and toxicity profiles are well documented (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3). In addition to its established role in alcohol abstinence, disulfiram has been repurposed for a number of other applications. Emerging investigations have highlighted its promising activity in malignancies, where disulfiram, often in conjunction with supplemental copper, has demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against cancer stem cells via mechanisms that involve proteasome inhibition and modulation of redox homeostasis (Lu et al., 2021, pp. 13–14; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). More recently, its anti-inflammatory potential has been explored in the context of infectious diseases and systemic inflammatory responses. For instance, disulfiram has been evaluated in sepsis models, where its inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis led to reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines and improved survival in animal models (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). In models of ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), disulfiram pretreatment was shown to ameliorate renal dysfunction and histological damage by suppressing the noncanonical caspase-11–GSDMD inflammatory axis (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6). Although direct clinical studies of disulfiram in chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis remain limited, the encouraging preclinical signals from acute kidney insults and its capacity to modulate cell death pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation suggest that disulfiram—and its metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate—might be effective in attenuating the injurious inflammatory cascades observed in CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, the repurposing hypothesis for disulfiram in chronic kidney disease centers on its recently identified inhibitory effect on gasdermin D (GSDMD), a pore-forming effector protein that is indispensable for the execution of pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory, lytic form of programmed cell death triggered by the activation of inflammasomes. When these multiprotein complexes form in response to pathogenic stimuli or sterile injury, they lead to the activation of inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1, and in noncanonical pathways, caspase-4/5/11. These enzymes cleave GSDMD to generate an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) that oligomerizes and inserts into the plasma membrane to form pores, thereby releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) into the extracellular milieu (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17). Disulfiram has been shown to block this crucial terminal step in pyroptosis by covalently modifying a conserved cysteine residue (Cys191 in human GSDMD and Cys192 in murine GSDMD) through a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. This chemical modification prevents the oligomerization and subsequent membrane pore formation by GSDMD, thereby directly inhibiting the execution phase of pyroptosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). Moreover, disulfiram’s activity is potentiated in the presence of copper ions, which may stabilize its reactive metabolites such as diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC), enhancing its inhibitory potency in cellular assays (Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18). The outcome of this inhibition is a significant reduction in the pyroptotic cell death cascade, as evidenced by decreased IL-1β release and overall attenuation of inflammatory signaling. In the context of the kidney, specifically within tubular epithelial cells (TECs), the inflammatory microenvironment driven by inflammasome activation is one of the critical factors in the progression from acute injury to chronic fibrosis. TECs are known to express inflammasome components and are susceptible to pyroptosis, which contributes to interstitial inflammation and fibrogenesis (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Therefore, by inhibiting the cleavage and activation of GSDMD in these cells, disulfiram has the potential to preserve tubular integrity and prevent the inflammatory cascade that ultimately drives chronic kidney injury.\n\nExpected Effect:  \nBased on the proposed hypothesis and data from related inflammatory and renal injury models, disulfiram is predicted to exert a protective effect in the setting of chronic kidney disease by targeting the final common pathway of pyroptotic cell death. In a typical in vitro assay using primary tubular epithelial cells or established TEC lines, treatment with disulfiram at concentrations within the non-cytotoxic range (e.g., 0.1–5 µM as indicated in hypoxia/reoxygenation models) is expected to prevent the formation of GSDMD pores, thereby reducing cell membrane disruption, limiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18), and preserving cell viability (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11). The expected molecular signature following disulfiram treatment would include decreased levels of cleaved (active) GSDMD, reduced caspase-11 activation along with lower concentrations of circulating cytokines, as well as preserved markers of epithelial cell integrity. Given that GSDMD and components of the inflammasome are expressed in tubular epithelial cells (as supported by studies focusing on renal inflammatory pathways; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 7–9; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 9–10), the inhibition of GSDMD pore formation directly addresses a mechanistic driver of tubular injury. This would translate into reduced interstitial inflammation and limited myofibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition, which are critical steps in the fibrotic process that underpins CKD progression (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Ultimately, the expectation is that a therapeutic regimen involving disulfiram may slow or even halt the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease by mitigating the damaging effects of pyroptosis.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nDisulfiram presents several attractive features as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. The strengths of disulfiram include:  \n1. A well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profile, supported by decades of clinical use in alcohol aversion therapy, which facilitates rapid translation into new clinical contexts (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Lu et al., 2021, p. 12).  \n2. A clear and innovative mechanism of action based on the inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis. This mechanism is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of CKD, where inflammasome activation and resultant pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells contribute to interstitial inflammation and fibrosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11).  \n3. The potential for its active metabolite, diethyldithiocarbamate, and the enhancing role of copper complexation to improve its potency as a pyroptosis inhibitor further bolster the therapeutic rationale (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18; Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34).  \n4. Preclinical evidence in models of acute kidney injury (ischemia-reperfusion injury) demonstrates that disulfiram can ameliorate renal dysfunction through inhibition of the caspase-11–GSDMD axis, suggesting that similar effects may be achieved in chronic inflammatory settings underlying CKD (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11).  \n\nHowever, there are also potential weaknesses and gaps that warrant further exploration:  \n1. Despite promising preclinical data in acute injury models and other inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, direct evidence of disulfiram’s efficacy in chronic kidney disease models remains limited. The available studies do not present long-term data specific to CKD or renal fibrosis, which is critical for validating its use in a chronic condition (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6).  \n2. While the mechanism of covalent modification of GSDMD at Cys191 is well supported by molecular studies, the extrapolation of these findings to tubular epithelial cells in the kidney (as opposed to macrophages or other inflammatory cells) requires additional confirmation. It is essential to verify that TECs exhibit similar susceptibility to the gasdermin D inhibitory effects of disulfiram under pathological conditions (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n3. Dosage optimization, chronic toxicity assessments, and potential off-target effects in the renal context have not yet been extensively characterized. Although the historical human use of disulfiram supports a favorable safety profile, the dosing regimen for CKD might differ from that used for alcohol aversion therapy, given the distinct pharmacodynamics required to inhibit pyroptosis in kidney tissues (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8).  \n4. Another consideration is the effect of systemic modulation of pyroptosis. Since pyroptosis is integral to effective immune responses under certain circumstances, indiscriminate long-term inhibition could potentially compromise host defenses against infections. This balance between therapeutic efficacy in CKD and preservation of necessary immune functions must be carefully evaluated in preclinical models and eventually in clinical trials (Hu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n\nIn summary, disulfiram emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease due to its novel mechanism of targeting gasdermin D-induced pyroptosis—a pathway that is increasingly recognized as a critical driver of renal inflammation and fibrogenesis. Its long clinical history, established oral bioavailability, and well-characterized safety profile offer substantial advantages that could accelerate its translation into CKD-focused studies. The evidence from acute kidney injury models and inflammatory disease research forms a strong mechanistic rationale for its use to preserve tubular epithelial integrity and mitigate interstitial inflammation. Nevertheless, further detailed studies are imperative to validate its effectiveness in chronic kidney models, delineate optimal dosing strategies, and ensure that the inhibition of pyroptosis does not adversely affect normal immune surveillance. Based on the data reviewed—from biochemical studies demonstrating covalent modification of GSDMD (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8) to preclinical studies in renal injury models (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6)—the overall evaluation supports continued investigation of disulfiram as a repurposed agent in CKD. Its potential to modulate a critical pathogenic pathway in chronic kidney injury could represent a novel therapeutic intervention that merits further preclinical and clinical development (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18).\n\nReferences  \nCai, Q., Sun, Z., Xu, S., Jiao, X., Guo, S., Li, Y., Wu, H., & Yu, X.

The compound belongs to a class of agents that includes disubstituted tetrazoles and cyanoguanidine derivatives, which have been characterized by their ability to selectively block P2X7 receptor activation without significantly affecting other P2X subtypes. Its design and synthesis were initially achieved by pharmaceutical research groups (notably Abbott Laboratories as indicated in early publications) and have since been commercialized by companies such as Tocris (catalog #2947). This class of compounds was originally optimized for studies in inflammatory processes and pain models, as they inhibit ATP‐induced ion flux such as calcium influx and potassium efflux, a key factor in the activation cascade of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nBiochemically and pharmacologically, A-438079 has been investigated in various preclinical models for its ability to mitigate inflammation. It has demonstrated efficacy in rodent models of neuropathic pain and inflammatory conditions by inhibiting P2X7-mediated IL-1β release. In terms of renal applications, there is evidence from several studies that selective P2X7 antagonism can protect against kidney insults such as ischemia-reperfusion injury and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. For example, Zhang et al. (2014) showed that blocking P2X7 with antagonists like A-438079 attenuated cisplatin-induced renal tubular damage by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis markers in mice (Zhang et al., 2014). Additionally, studies such as those by Arulkumaran (2016) and colleagues have demonstrated that while genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of P2X7 in some models does not always equate to improved renal function, the block of P2X7-related signaling reduces inflammasome activation and cytokine release in immune cells and tubular epithelium (Arulkumaran, 2016; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Even though A-438079 has not been widely tested clinically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), its pharmacological profile as a P2X7 antagonist has been well characterized in biochemical studies and preclinical kidney injury models. This builds an indirect but strong rationale for repurposing it in CKD contexts, where sustained inflammation and fibrosis are major pathogenic drivers (Birch et al., 2013; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe primary mechanism of A-438079 is its high-affinity, selective antagonism of the P2X7 receptor. The P2X7 receptor is unique among the P2X family in its requirement for high concentrations of ATP, which are typically achieved in pathological conditions involving cell injury and inflammation. Under normal conditions, extracellular ATP levels are low; however, during tissue damage, ATP is released into the extracellular space where it binds to and activates P2X7 receptors expressed on immune cells (especially macrophages) and renal tubular epithelial cells (Han et al., 2020; Howarth, 2020).  \n\nUpon binding of ATP to the receptor, P2X7 undergoes a conformational change that opens its ion channel, permitting the influx of calcium ions and the efflux of potassium ions. This potassium efflux is a critical upstream event that triggers the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex responsible for activating caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 then cleaves the precursors of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature, secreted forms. These cytokines play major roles in propagating inflammatory signals, inducing pyroptosis (a form of inflammatory cell death), and promoting fibrotic remodeling in affected tissues (Qian et al., 2021; Shokoples, 2022).\n\nA-438079 interacts with the P2X7 receptor by competitively inhibiting ATP binding, thereby preventing the channel’s conformational change and subsequent ion flux. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) is approximately 40 nM in rodent models, indicating high potency (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). By blocking this pathway, A-438079 inhibits downstream events including NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 cleavage, and the release of IL-1β, ultimately reducing inflammatory responses and preventing the activation of fibrotic signaling pathways in kidney tissue, particularly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells where P2X7 and NLRP3 are highly expressed (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the context of chronic kidney disease, the principal pathological mechanisms include persistent inflammation and fibrosis, processes that are significantly driven by inflammasome activation in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. The hypothesis postulates that A-438079 will block ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor in these cell types. By doing so, it prevents the crucial potassium efflux that is necessary for the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The expected downstream effects include a reduction in caspase-1 activation, decreased cleavage of pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β, and ultimately lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This chain of events is anticipated to reduce pyroptosis and curb the progression of fibrosis within the kidney (Qian et al., 2021; Arulkumaran et al., 2018).\n\nRenal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells are known to express both the P2X7 receptor and NLRP3, as evidenced by various studies outlining their roles in mediating inflammation-driven fibrosis in CKD (Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020). In assays, it is expected that treatment with A-438079 would result in a measurable decrease in IL-1β release, reduced markers of inflammation such as caspase-1 activity, and potentially lower expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components. Furthermore, by blunting chronic inflammatory responses, A-438079 may help to preserve kidney structure and function, thereby slowing the progression of CKD. The compound’s favorable pharmacokinetic properties—particularly its demonstrated bioavailability and minimal off-target effects—support the feasibility of achieving these outcomes (Burnstock, 2017).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nA-438079 presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on several factors. One of its major strengths lies in its selectivity and potency as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, which allows it to precisely target an upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that is centrally implicated in CKD. The ability of A-438079 to block ATP-induced ion flux is particularly compelling because it interrupts the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a known driver of IL-1β and IL-18 release in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells (Arulkumaran, 2016; Qian et al., 2021). This molecular specificity holds promise for reducing inflammation and subsequent fibrotic formation in the kidney, both of which are critical elements in CKD progression.\n\nThe preclinical evidence supporting the use of P2X7 antagonists in models of acute kidney injury, such as cisplatin nephrotoxicity and sepsis-induced renal injury, provides additional rationale, even though such models are not perfect surrogates for CKD (Zhang et al., 2014; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Some studies have demonstrated that selective P2X7 blockade can attenuate inflammatory cytokine production, improve renal function markers, and reduce cell death, thereby supporting the hypothesis that similar benefits could be realized in chronic inflammatory settings like CKD (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nAdditionally, the mechanistic details of P2X7 receptor signaling – requiring high extracellular ATP concentrations, initiating K+ efflux, and triggering inflammasome assembly – align closely with the known processes of renal inflammation and fibrosis. The fact that P2X7 and NLRP3 are co-expressed in key renal cell populations reinforces the logic behind using A-438079 to target these pathways (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and potential challenges that need to be considered. Firstly, in some preclinical models, especially in certain rat strains (as noted by studies involving P2X7 receptor knockout rats), the inhibition or deletion of P2X7 did not significantly alter renal function or prevent kidney injury induced by hypertensive factors such as angiotensin II (Nespoux et al., 2024). This suggests that compensatory pathways may exist, and the role of P2X7 might be context-dependent or vary among species. Secondly, clinical trials of P2X7 antagonists in other inflammatory diseases have had mixed outcomes, raising concerns about translational efficacy in human CKD (Luz et al., 2019). Moreover, while the mechanism of inflammasome inhibition is well understood in vitro, the in vivo pharmacodynamics in the kidney may be complicated by variable local ATP concentrations and the dynamic expression of the receptor in disease states.\n\nFrom a drug development standpoint, the potency (IC50 ~40 nM) and reported good bioavailability of A-438079 are advantageous. Its minimal off-target effects also reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions in clinical translation. However, more robust and specific data in CKD models are necessary to establish whether the attenuation of IL-1β release can consistently translate into meaningful improvements in renal fibrosis and overall kidney function over long-term treatment courses (Chen et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2024).\n\nIn summary, A-438079’s targeted inhibition of the P2X7 receptor offers a novel approach to halt the ATP-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby mitigating a key upstream trigger of inflammatory cascades in CKD. Its preclinical track record in inflammatory and renal injury models, combined with its mechanistic specificity, positions it as a strong candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease. Nonetheless, species variability, redundant inflammatory pathways, and the need for further in vivo validation in models of long-term kidney disease remain potential hurdles. If these challenges are addressed in further preclinical and early clinical studies, A-438079 could represent a significant advance in targeting the inflammation-fibrosis axis in CKD (Arulkumaran et al., 2018; Fantauzzi, 2013; Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe strengths of A-438079 for CKD include its high potency, selectivity, and well-elucidated mechanism of action in blocking ATP-induced P2X7 receptor activation—a critical initiator of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. These molecular interactions have been robustly characterized in multiple preclinical studies, indicating that the drug may effectively reduce IL-1β-mediated inflammation and subsequent fibrotic responses. In models of acute renal injury, antagonizing P2X7 has led to reduced cell death and improved renal function, which supports its potential usage in CKD where chronic inflammation is a driver of progressive fibrosis. Moreover, the chemical class to which A-438079 belongs has been extensively employed in studies of inflammatory diseases, reinforcing the feasibility of this approach (Deplano, 2012; Qian et al., 2021).\n\nConversely, potential weaknesses lie in the heterogeneity of experimental outcomes across different preclinical models and species. Some studies have shown that genetic deletion of P2X7 in rats does not always confer renal protection in induced kidney injury, suggesting that the pathophysiology in certain species—or even specific CKD etiologies—may be driven by redundant pathways beyond P2X7/NLRP3. In addition, although A-438079 demonstrates promising in vitro efficacy, there remains a critical need for long-term in vivo studies specifically in CKD models to verify that its anti-inflammatory effects translate into clinically meaningful outcomes in terms of preservation of renal function and reduction in fibrosis. Lastly, it is important to consider potential compensatory mechanisms in chronic inflammation that may limit the sole efficacy of P2X7 inhibition (Nespoux et al., 2024; Luz et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, A-438079 is a scientifically compelling therapeutic candidate for CKD, with robust mechanistic support and significant preclinical evidence in inflammatory models. Its ability to target the P2X7/NLRP3 axis addresses a novel therapeutic area in CKD by potentially halting the progression of inflammation-driven fibrosis. However, potential limitations due to species-specific responses and redundancy in inflammatory signaling must be carefully evaluated in future studies. Overall, A-438079 merits further investigation as part of a multi-pronged approach to modulate inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in chronic kidney disease (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:  \nArulkumaran, N.

"(OLT1177, 8)","(MCC950, 9)","Both OLT1177 (dapansutrile) and MCC950 are selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors with strong mechanistic rationale for CKD, targeting the NACHT domain to block ATPase activity and prevent caspase-1–mediated IL-1β/IL-18 activation and pyroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells. MCC950 has more extensive preclinical efficacy across multiple CKD models (diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, adenine‐induced renal failure) with reductions in proteinuria, fibrosis, and improved renal function in rodents, and safety in non-human primates. OLT1177, conversely, has compelling preclinical data in diabetic and crystal nephropathy models showing reduced IL-1β, macrophage infiltration, and fibrosis, plus Phase I clinical safety and target engagement data in humans. Both compounds are orally bioavailable, but OLT1177 has an established human safety and PK profile. MCC950’s binding to the Walker B motif is elegantly validated by SPR mutagenesis studies, whereas OLT1177’s engagement of the NACHT domain is supported by PNAS data. Human translational risk is lower for OLT1177 given existing Phase I tolerability, whereas MCC950 lacks published human safety trials and may face regulatory hurdles. Neither candidate has been evaluated in CKD patients, but OLT1177’s clinical track record and known ADME/PK favor feasibility.","While MCC950 shows broader preclinical efficacy in diverse CKD models, OLT1177’s progression into human trials with an excellent safety profile and demonstrated pharmacodynamics gives it a translational advantage. The established human tolerability and oral bioavailability of OLT1177 reduce key late‐stage development risks. Both share a clear, highly plausible MoA targeting NLRP3, but repurposing OLT1177 leverages existing safety data to accelerate clinical testing in CKD. Therefore, OLT1177 (ID 8) is prioritized over MCC950 (ID 9).",27,"(8, 9)","{'hypothesis': 'OLT1177 (Dapansutrile; InvivoGen, catalog #tlrl-olt1177)', 'answer': 'Proposal for OLT1177 (Dapansutrile; InvivoGen, catalog #tlrl-olt1177)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nOLT1177, also known as dapansutrile, is a synthetic small-molecule inhibitor that belongs to the β-sulfonyl nitrile class of compounds, developed specifically for its selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The compound was synthesized via a chemically directed approach—in particular, its synthesis involved an alkylation reaction of sodium methanesulfinate with 3-bromopropionitrile, yielding a β-sulfonyl nitrile moiety that confers its inhibitory activity (Marchetti et al., 2018). This class of small molecule inhibitors has been widely explored for targeting inflammatory pathways through modulation of innate immune responses. Historically, β-sulfonyl nitrile compounds have attracted attention as therapeutic agents due to their capacity to engage key protein domains involved in inflammation while maintaining selectivity and oral bioavailability, attributes that are critical for chronic treatment regimens (Marchetti et al., 2018).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOLT1177 has progressed through several stages of development and clinical evaluation in diseases characterized by uncontrolled inflammation, notably in acute gout flares, heart failure, and conditions linked to cytokine release syndromes. In Phase I clinical trials, dapansutrile demonstrated an excellent safety profile when administered to healthy subjects at dosages up to 1000 mg per day for 8 days, thereby establishing its tolerability and preliminary evidence of target engagement (Jansen et al., 2019). Moreover, therapeutic evaluations in inflammatory settings—such as a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study in patients with NYHA II–III systolic heart failure—further underscored its favorable safety profile and pharmacodynamic effects despite the fact that current clinical investigations have not directly targeted Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) populations (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical studies in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy have demonstrated that treatment with OLT1177 leads to significant reductions in renal IL-1β levels, decreased macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis, suggesting that its benefits extend to kidney-related inflammatory damage (Mulay, 2019). Although clinical trials specifically focused on CKD or renal inflammation are lacking at this point, the robust anti-inflammatory effects observed in related models and conditions provide a sound rationale for repurposing OLT1177 in chronic kidney disease.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, OLT1177 selectively inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by targeting its central NACHT domain, where it interferes with ATPase activity that is critical for the oligomerization process necessary for inflammasome assembly. Under normal conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggers the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), leading to the formation of a multi-protein complex that activates caspase-1 and drives the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) (Kim et al., 2019). OLT1177 binds specifically to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, thereby blocking the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC, which is a necessary event for full inflammasome assembly (Marchetti et al., 2018). In doing so, it prevents the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-1 and effectively reduces the secretion of IL-1β. This mechanism is particularly significant in environments of hyperglycemic stress, where increased NLRP3 activity in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) drives inflammation, pyroptotic cell death, and subsequent tubulointerstitial fibrosis (Mulay, 2019). Additionally, by curtailing downstream cytokine release and pyroptosis, OLT1177 is believed to mitigate the metabolic cost of inflammation, an effect that has been observed in multiple preclinical in vivo studies in conditions ranging from acute arthritis to cardiac dysfunction (Jansen et al., 2019; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe central hypothesis is that through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, OLT1177 will effectively block the recruitment of ASC and disrupt subsequent caspase-1 activation in renal tubular cells, particularly under conditions of hyperglycemia which are common in diabetic nephropathy. Under hyperglycemic stress, renal tubular epithelial cells exhibit increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and aberrant inflammasome activation resulting in heightened secretion of IL-1β, a cytokine implicated in promoting fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition. By preventing the cleavage of pro-IL-1β into its active form, OLT1177 is expected to prevent pyroptotic cell death of TECs and interrupt the deleterious cycle of inflammation-driven fibrogenesis in the kidney (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Evidence from animal models indicates that selective blockade of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to a marked decrease in renal inflammation as evidenced by reduced macrophage infiltration and lower profibrotic cytokine levels, which supports the expectation that OLT1177 could yield appreciable renoprotective outcomes in CKD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In the proposed assay, it is anticipated that OLT1177 will reduce markers of inflammation such as IL-1β and IL-18 in the culture medium of hyperglycemia-stressed TECs, thereby correlating with decreased pyroptosis and improved cell viability. This would be further corroborated by downstream effects such as reduced activation of profibrotic pathways, including lower TGF-β signaling and diminished deposition of fibrotic markers, ultimately mitigating the progression toward renal fibrosis (Cliff, 2023; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate with substantial potential for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease owing to its well-characterized mechanism of action, favorable preclinical results, and established safety profile in early clinical studies. One of the major strengths of OLT1177 lies in its selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an attractive target given the critical role of NLRP3 in mediating renal inflammation, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenesis. Its synthetic origins and robust medicinal chemistry underpin its precise targeting of the NACHT domain in NLRP3, effectively sparing other inflammasomes and reducing the risk of broad immunosuppression (Marchetti et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Furthermore, its oral bioavailability and metabolic stability make it suitable for chronic administration, an essential consideration for CKD where long-term therapy is required (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nFrom a therapeutic history perspective, although OLT1177 has not yet been directly tested in human CKD patient populations, its successful progression through Phase I trials for conditions such as gout and heart failure, combined with promising data in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy, strongly supports its potential utility in renal settings (Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Preclinical studies show reduced renal IL-1β secretion, diminished macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis when NLRP3 is inhibited by agents like OLT1177, lending biological credence to the hypothesis that inflammasome inhibition could slow CKD progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nAt the molecular level, the precise action of OLT1177—binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ASC recruitment—represents a highly targeted approach that contrasts with cytokine-neutralizing therapies such as anti-IL-1β antibodies. This specificity is advantageous because it not only prevents the generation of IL-1β but also curtails the activation of NFκB and other downstream inflammatory cascades, potentially reducing off-target effects and preserving broader immune competence (Marchetti et al., 2018; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020). Additionally, the expected anti-inflammatory effects in renal tubular cells—specifically preventing pyroptosis and fibrogenesis—are consistent with literature demonstrating that NLRP3 is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells under hyperglycemic and inflammatory stress (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain. One of the limitations stems from the current lack of direct clinical evidence in CKD populations; while animal models provide a strong rationale, the translation of these findings into human CKD may be complicated by the multifactorial nature of the disease, where multiple pathways contribute to renal injury beyond inflammasome activation. Additionally, the chronic nature of CKD necessitates prolonged administration of therapeutic agents, and long-term safety data for OLT1177 in such a setting are still pending. There is also the possibility that inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome might impair necessary innate immune responses, although the specificity of OLT1177 for the NLRP3 complex—in contrast to more generalized anti-inflammatory agents—should, in theory, mitigate this concern (Seok et al., 2021).\n\nMoreover, while the preclinical data in models of diabetic nephropathy and crystal-induced kidney injury are promising, variability in genetic and environmental factors in human CKD could affect the compound’s efficacy. It will therefore be critical to design dedicated clinical trials in defined CKD populations, ideally incorporating biomarkers of inflammasome activity, such as circulating IL-1β and IL-18 levels, as well as imaging and functional assessments of renal fibrosis and function. The anti-fibrotic effects, in particular, warrant closer mechanistic studies to confirm that inhibition of TEC pyroptosis and preservation of tubular integrity occur in the human kidney as they do in animal models (Williams et al., 2022; Cliff, 2023).\n\nIn conclusion, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) represents a compelling candidate for repurposing in Chronic Kidney Disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, favorable pharmacological profile, and preclinical evidence supporting its renoprotective effects. Its ability to directly inhibit the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding to the NACHT domain and blocking ASC recruitment addresses a critical upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that leads to caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and subsequent pyroptosis of renal tubular cells. This mode of action has the potential to attenuate the inflammation-driven fibrogenesis that is central to CKD progression, particularly in diabetic nephropathy where hyperglycemic stress is a key driver of renal injury.\n\nStrengths of OLT1177 include its synthetic origin allowing for structural optimization, its demonstrated safety in Phase I clinical trials, its oral bioavailability which is advantageous for chronic therapy, and its selective inhibitory action that minimizes off-target effects. Additionally, existing preclinical studies showing reduced renal IL-1β, diminished macrophage infiltration, and lowered fibrotic responses in models of nephropathy provide a promising foundation for further exploration in CKD (Mulay, 2019; Jansen et al., 2019).\n\nWeaknesses or challenges include the current absence of dedicated clinical trials in CKD, the complexity of CKD pathophysiology where multiple inflammatory and fibrotic pathways are involved, and the potential risk that chronic inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome could in some contexts compromise the host defense or alter essential cellular processes. These concerns underscore the need for carefully designed preclinical studies specifically in renal disease models, followed by early phase clinical trials in well-defined CKD populations to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and long-term safety.\n\nOverall, based on the comprehensive literature review, the mechanistic rationale, and the encouraging preclinical and early clinical data available, OLT1177 shows significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease. The next steps should involve further detailed studies in CKD-specific preclinical models that assess not only inflammatory cytokine modulation but also functional outcomes such as glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria reduction, and fibrosis attenuation. A robust clinical development program targeting patients with diabetic nephropathy and other forms of CKD characterized by inflammasome activation would be the logical progression to validate its clinical utility (Marchetti et al., 2018; Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nReferences  \nCliff, C.

It belongs to the diarylsulfonylurea class of compounds, which emerged from medicinal chemistry efforts that initially focused on sulfonylurea drugs such as glyburide. Glyburide was found to have anti‐inflammatory properties mediated by inhibition of the NLRP3 complex; however, its clinical utility as an anti-inflammatory agent was limited by its potent effects on insulin release and the consequent risk of hypoglycemia. To overcome these limitations, researchers refined the chemical structure and synthesized MCC950, a derivative that retains the inflammasome inhibitory activity of glyburide without disturbing insulin secretion. The design of MCC950 was based on structure–activity relationship studies that identified the importance of the diarylsulfonylurea moiety, and its eventual discovery positioned it as a gold-standard benchmark compound for NLRP3 inhibition (Kaur et al., 2025; Coll et al., 2019). This compound has been synthesized and purified by several vendors including Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #SML 2233), ensuring reproducibility and accessibility to research teams. Overall, MCC950 represents a promising example of rational drug design aimed at selectively targeting components of the innate immune system and addressing the inflammatory cascades that contribute to disease pathology.\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of MCC950 is marked by extensive preclinical evidence spanning animal models of a wide array of inflammatory disorders. Initially investigated in models of auto-inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, MCC950 quickly emerged as the benchmark inhibitor for studying NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated inflammation. In rodent models of kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, and adenine-induced chronic renal failure, MCC950 has demonstrated significant reductions in proteinuria, attenuated fibrosis, and improvements in overall renal function (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). Preclinical studies conducted in diabetic models have shown that chronic treatment with MCC950 leads to marked improvements in histopathological kidney damage, as evidenced by reduced mesangial expansion and decreased podocyte injury (Zhang et al., 2019). In addition, rodent studies in salt-sensitive hypertensive models reveal that inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome via MCC950 results in lower blood pressure, decreased interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, and reduced collagen deposition in renal tissues (Krishnan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2025). Although robust evidence from animal studies supports its efficacy in models of chronic kidney disease (CKD), clinical translation remains limited with only sparse early-phase clinical trials referenced in the literature (ClinicalTrials.gov). Additionally, the favorable safety profile observed in non-human primate studies further underpins its potential for repurposing in CKD, although more clinical data are needed to fully establish its benefit–risk profile.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nMCC950’s mechanism of action is both specific and well-characterized at the molecular level. The compound exerts its inhibitory effect by directly binding to the Walker B motif located within the NACHT domain of the NLRP3 protein. This binding interferes with the ATP hydrolysis that is essential for NLRP3 activation and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Under normal pathological conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC and the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form. Active caspase-1 then processes pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature forms and also initiates gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death. By preventing ATP hydrolysis, MCC950 locks NLRP3 in an inactive conformation, thereby obstructing the assembly of the entire inflammasome complex, reducing caspase-1 activation and cytokine maturation (Kim et al., 2019; Zhan et al., 2023). In the context of human tubular epithelial cells (TECs), which express NLRP3 and contribute to renal inflammatory cascades, MCC950’s engagement with the Walker B motif is proposed to significantly curb inflammasome formation. Such direct target engagement has been validated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and mutagenesis assays that confirm the drug’s specificity and potency. Blocking inflammasome assembly not only reduces cytokine release but also limits the formation of gasdermin D pores that are responsible for pyroptotic cell death, thereby preventing tubular cell loss and reducing interstitial inflammation (Liu et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven its robust preclinical evidence, the expected effect of MCC950 in assays focusing on CKD and related kidney injury is multifaceted. In in vitro models using human TECs, the hypothesis is that treatment with MCC950 will prevent ATP hydrolysis, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. As a result, the maturation and release of IL-1β and IL-18 will be significantly reduced, ultimately leading to lower levels of pyroptosis, attenuation of inflammation, and prevention of the fibrotic remodeling that often accompanies progressive CKD (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). In vivo, these effects are anticipated to manifest as decreased proteinuria, improved kidney function markers, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, and lower extracellular matrix deposition. This translates into a reduction in renal interstitial fibrosis and a preservation of normal tubular architecture, thereby ameliorating the progressive decline in renal function seen in CKD models. The expression profile of NLRP3 in TECs, coupled with its established role in mediating inflammatory and fibrotic responses, provides a solid rationale for targeting NLRP3 in chronic kidney disease (Zhang et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). The proposed mechanism is in alignment with the pathological features of CKD, where sustained low-grade inflammation and fibrosis lead to irreversible kidney damage.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nMCC950 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease due to several compelling strengths. First, its rational design as a selective NLRP3 inhibitor ensures that it directly targets a critical inflammatory pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of CKD. The extensive preclinical evidence in diverse animal models—from diabetic nephropathy to salt-sensitive hypertension and adenine-induced renal failure—strongly supports its renoprotective effects, including reductions in proteinuria, improved renal function, and diminished fibrotic remodeling (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Sabra et al., 2023). Second, the detailed elucidation of its molecular mechanism—confirming binding to the Walker B motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ATP hydrolysis—provides a clear mechanistic rationale that is essential for translational development (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Third, its favorable pharmacological properties, including oral bioavailability and a safety profile established in non-human primates, further underline its developmental feasibility (Kaur et al., 2025; ClinicalTrials.gov).  \n\nHowever, there are some potential weaknesses that must be carefully considered. Although rodent models have provided robust efficacy data, the translation of these effects to humans remains to be fully validated. There is a paucity of comprehensive clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with MCC950, which introduces uncertainty regarding its efficacy and potential off-target effects in a human patient population. Additionally, while the compound is highly selective for the NLRP3 inflammasome, it is critical to further elucidate its long-term safety and impact on global immune function, given the essential role of inflammasomes in host defense. In some experimental contexts, there has been variability in the inhibition of inflammation and fibrosis depending on the specific disease model, suggesting that its therapeutic window may differ based on disease etiology (Sabra et al., 2023). Despite these challenges, the overall evidence supports the further development of MCC950 as a mechanistic intervention in CKD, particularly in settings where inflammasome-driven pathology is predominant.\n\nIn summary, MCC950 is a well-characterized, rationally designed NLRP3 inhibitor with strong preclinical evidence demonstrating its renoprotective effects in various models of chronic kidney disease. Its specific binding to the Walker B motif of the NLRP3 NACHT domain and subsequent inhibition of ATP hydrolysis form the basis of its mechanism, reducing caspase-1 activation, IL-1β/IL-18 maturation, and gasdermin-D-mediated pyroptosis. These actions are expected to translate into reduced tubular epithelial cell death, diminished interstitial inflammation, and alleviation of fibrotic remodeling—key pathological processes in CKD progression. While further clinical validation is necessary, the strengths in mechanistic rationale, preclinical efficacy data, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties position MCC950 as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Coll et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022).\n\nReferences  \nColl, R.

"(MCC950, 9)","(INF4E, 4)","Both candidates target the NLRP3 inflammasome via blockade of its ATPase function in the NACHT domain, yet they differ substantially in translational readiness. MCC950 (ID: 9) has extensive, directly relevant preclinical data in multiple rodent models of CKD—including diabetic nephropathy, salt‐sensitive hypertension, and adenine‐induced renal failure—where it consistently reduced proteinuria, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis and improved functional endpoints. Its mechanism is clearly validated by structural, SPR, and mutagenesis assays, confirming reversible, high‐affinity binding to the Walker B motif without off‐target effects on insulin release. Oral bioavailability, non‐human primate safety data, and well‐established pharmacokinetics further support its feasibility for CKD. In contrast, INF4E (ID: 4) is a covalent, acrylate‐based NLRP3 inhibitor with solid phenotypic potency in inflammatory models (sepsis, IBD, cardiovascular) and a plausible mechanism for preventing pyroptosis in hypoxic proximal tubular cells. However, it lacks any direct in vivo CKD efficacy data, clinical or veterinary safety profile in renal contexts, and carries higher risk of off‐target cytotoxicity due to its electrophilic, irreversible binding. While INF4E is scientifically interesting and novel, its translational gap and safety liabilities outweigh its mechanistic strengths relative to MCC950.","MCC950 clearly outperforms INF4E on the highest‐priority criteria: it has robust, disease‐specific preclinical efficacy in CKD models; a reversible, highly selective MoA validated in multiple assays; documented oral PK and safety in higher species; and measurable renal endpoints (proteinuria, histology). INF4E, despite a sound mechanistic rationale, remains at the preclinical discovery stage with no CKD in vivo data and carries greater off‐target toxicity risk from covalent chemistry. Therefore, MCC950 is the stronger candidate for advancement toward a viable CKD therapy.",28,"(4, 9)","{'hypothesis': 'INF4E (Tocris, catalog #5903)', 'answer': 'Proposal for INF4E (Tocris, catalog #5903)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nINF4E is a synthetic electrophilic small‐molecule inhibitor that was initially discovered through phenotypic screening in macrophage models testing for NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. It is an acrylate derivative belonging to a class of compounds that harness α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl (Michael acceptor) functionalities to achieve covalent, irreversible inhibition of target proteins. Its discovery emerged during screening campaigns that looked for submicromolar potency against NLRP3, with subsequent chemical optimization to balance reactivity and cytotoxicity. Specifically, INF4E (also referred to in some studies as compound 9) was identified for its ability to selectively inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation by binding covalently to the NACHT domain’s ATP‐binding site, thereby interfering with ATP hydrolysis required for the conformational changes that lead to inflammasome assembly (Cocco et al., 2017; Blevins et al., 2022). As a member of the acrylate derivatives class, similar compounds have been explored in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular disorders, where targeting NLRP3 has shown promise. Members of this chemical class have a well‐documented history of being used as selective covalent modifiers with potential in modulating inflammatory signaling cascades.  \n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of INF4E and its related chemical family primarily stems from preclinical studies where they have been shown to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in various models of inflammation. INF4E was originally validated in sepsis models, demonstrating efficacy in reducing systemic inflammation, and subsequent studies extended its utility to show anti‐pyroptotic effects in macrophage cell lines with submicromolar potency. Moreover, related acrylate derivatives have been explored in inflammatory bowel disease models, where modifications to reduce cytotoxicity led to the generation of analogues such as INF39. Although the preclinical literature for this class of inhibitors is robust in the context of sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, and even in models of ischemic injury in the heart, there is no direct literature evidence that INF4E has been specifically used for treating chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis. Searches in Clinical Trials databases for “NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have revealed only nascent clinical exploration of NLRP3 inhibitors in renal disease, with most candidates like MCC950 and OLT1177 being at early development stages (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023). Thus, while INF4E’s mechanism of NLRP3 inhibition is highly relevant to inflammatory processes, its therapeutic history in kidney disease remains limited to preclinical mechanistic rationale rather than established clinical or veterinary use in CKD.  \n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, INF4E exerts its action by covalently binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, specifically targeting its ATP‐binding site. The NACHT domain is essential for NLRP3 oligomerization and subsequent inflammasome assembly. INF4E’s acrylate (Michael acceptor) moiety reacts with cysteine residues present in this domain, thereby irreversibly blocking ATP hydrolysis. The inhibition of ATP hydrolysis interferes directly with the required conformational changes that transform NLRP3 from an inactive to an active state capable of recruiting the adaptor protein ASC and procaspase‐1. Consequently, the subsequent cleavage of caspase‐1 is prevented, which in turn stops the maturation and release of key pro‐inflammatory cytokines, notably IL‐1β and IL‐18 (Mezzaroma et al., 2021; Cocco et al., 2017).  \nThis covalent binding mechanism is particularly significant because it offers prolonged inhibitory effects owing to its irreversible nature. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, where hypoxia serves as a potent priming signal for inflammasome activation and contributes to chronic inflammation and fibrosis, inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E is hypothesized to prevent the cascade leading to caspase‐1 activation, thus mitigating caspase‐1–dependent pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death—and reducing the release of IL‐18 (Blevins et al., 2022; Komada & Muruve, 2019).  \nThe biochemical interactions of INF4E align with the known structure–activity relationships of electrophilic acrylate derivatives, as these compounds are designed to target the ATPase activity of NLRP3. By interfering with this enzymatic function, INF4E halts the nucleation of the inflammasome complex, thereby curtailing downstream signaling that ultimately leads to pyroptosis and fibrogenesis. The short-lived yet potent irreversible binding is a hallmark of this class of inhibitors, which has been exploited in several preclinical studies to provide a potent blockade of inflammation (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the context of the proposed assay and the underlying pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease, INF4E is anticipated to exhibit a therapeutic effect by mitigating hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation in proximal tubular epithelial cells. Hypoxic conditions are known to prime and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in these cells, and this process is a major contributor to tubular cell injury, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenic signaling—all key drivers of CKD progression.  \nThe expected outcome when applying INF4E would be a significant reduction in ATP hydrolysis that is crucial for NLRP3 activation, thereby preventing the subsequent assembly of the inflammasome complex. This inhibition should lead to a decrease in caspase‐1 activity, ultimately lowering the maturation and secretion of IL‐18 (and possibly IL‐1β). Reduced levels of IL‐18 would then limit the inflammatory and fibrogenic signaling cascades that promote the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis. In assays using hypoxic proximal tubular cells, one would therefore predict reduced markers of pyroptosis, improved cell viability, and a lower expression of fibrogenic proteins such as TGF-β and α-SMA.  \nThere is also supportive evidence that NLRP3 is expressed in proximal tubular cells and that its activation is directly linked to inflammatory responses and fibrosis under hypoxic conditions (Ochoa et al., 2023; Komada & Muruve, 2019). The selective inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E should thus translate into improved cellular integrity and a mitigated progression of the inflammatory milieu that typifies CKD. This expected modulation of pyroptosis and fibrosis markers provides a clear biochemical rationale for using INF4E as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic therapeutic candidate in kidney disease models.  \n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe analysis of INF4E as a repurposed drug candidate for chronic kidney disease presents both promising and challenging aspects. One major strength of INF4E lies in its clearly defined mechanism of action; by targeting the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and interfering with ATP hydrolysis, INF4E offers a direct method to abrogate inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. This is particularly relevant in CKD, where hypoxia-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in proximal tubular cells is a key pathological event leading to pyroptosis, inflammation, and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019).  \nAnother strength is its proven submicromolar potency as demonstrated in phenotypic screens, along with a degree of oral bioavailability in rodent models that supports the feasibility of future in vivo investigations (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021). This potency, combined with its specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome, positions INF4E as a candidate with the potential to modulate inflammatory responses without broadly suppressing the entire immune system. Moreover, by specifically reducing IL-18 release, INF4E may offer advantages over broader anti-inflammatory approaches that risk impairing normal host defense mechanisms (Thomas et al., 2022).  \nA potential weakness, however, is the risk associated with irreversible covalent binding, which, while conferring prolonged effects, may also lead to off-target toxicity if the selectivity is not absolute. Some acrylate derivatives have been noted for cytotoxicity issues, and although chemical optimization—such as the development of related compounds like INF39—has been undertaken to alleviate these concerns, it remains a critical point for evaluation in renal cells that are already susceptible to injury under hypoxic conditions (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \nFurthermore, while the mechanistic rationale for targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in CKD is strong, the clinical translation of NLRP3 inhibitors has been slow. Currently, only limited clinical trial data are available for NLRP3 inhibitors in CKD, and the majority of evidence remains at the preclinical level (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023).  \nAnother consideration is that chronic kidney disease is a multifactorial condition wherein inflammasome activation is just one of several pathogenic processes, including metabolic dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and oxidative stress. Therefore, while INF4E may effectively block one critical pathway—namely, hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation—it might need to be combined with therapies targeting other aspects of CKD pathogenesis to achieve a comprehensive therapeutic effect (Unknown Reference; Mulay, 2019).  \nDespite these challenges, INF4E’s selectivity for a mechanistically validated target, its oral availability, and its demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory models provide a strong rationale for further investigation. In assays designed to model hypoxic tubular injury, INF4E is expected to reduce pyroptosis and fibrogenic signaling, thereby slowing CKD progression. The drug’s success in other inflammatory contexts, such as sepsis models, lends additional weight to its potential, although caution must be exercised when extrapolating these data to the complex microenvironment of the kidney (Blevins et al., 2022; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \n\nContinued research should focus on dosing optimization, safety profiling in kidney-specific models, and investigation of combination strategies that target both inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in CKD (Komada & Muruve, 2019; Mulay, 2019; Pagliaro & Penna, 2023; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nOverall, INF4E represents a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for chronic kidney disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, which aligns well with an established pathogenic pathway in CKD—namely, hypoxia-driven NLRP3 inflammasome activation in proximal tubular cells. Its ability to block the ATPase activity of NLRP3, thereby preventing both caspase-1 activation and IL-18 release, underpins a novel strategy aimed at mitigating pyroptosis and subsequent fibrogenic signaling cascades. While challenges such as potential off-target cytotoxicity, the need for extensive in vivo validation in CKD models, and integration into a multifactorial therapeutic approach remain, the compelling preclinical data for related compounds and the rigorous mechanistic underpinnings provide a strong basis for advancing INF4E in further preclinical studies and eventual clinical trials. Continued research should include detailed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological evaluations in renal models, as well as assessments of its efficacy in reducing markers of inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrosis in hypoxic proximal tubular cells. Given the complexity of CKD, INF4E may ultimately be best suited for combination therapy alongside agents addressing complementary pathogenic mechanisms. Overall, the potential strengths of INF4E—rooted in its selective, irreversible inhibition of a well‐validated molecular target—are balanced by the need for careful evaluation of safety and clinical translatability in the setting of chronic kidney disease (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nReferences:  \nBlevins, H.

It belongs to the diarylsulfonylurea class of compounds, which emerged from medicinal chemistry efforts that initially focused on sulfonylurea drugs such as glyburide. Glyburide was found to have anti‐inflammatory properties mediated by inhibition of the NLRP3 complex; however, its clinical utility as an anti-inflammatory agent was limited by its potent effects on insulin release and the consequent risk of hypoglycemia. To overcome these limitations, researchers refined the chemical structure and synthesized MCC950, a derivative that retains the inflammasome inhibitory activity of glyburide without disturbing insulin secretion. The design of MCC950 was based on structure–activity relationship studies that identified the importance of the diarylsulfonylurea moiety, and its eventual discovery positioned it as a gold-standard benchmark compound for NLRP3 inhibition (Kaur et al., 2025; Coll et al., 2019). This compound has been synthesized and purified by several vendors including Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #SML 2233), ensuring reproducibility and accessibility to research teams. Overall, MCC950 represents a promising example of rational drug design aimed at selectively targeting components of the innate immune system and addressing the inflammatory cascades that contribute to disease pathology.\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of MCC950 is marked by extensive preclinical evidence spanning animal models of a wide array of inflammatory disorders. Initially investigated in models of auto-inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, MCC950 quickly emerged as the benchmark inhibitor for studying NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated inflammation. In rodent models of kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, and adenine-induced chronic renal failure, MCC950 has demonstrated significant reductions in proteinuria, attenuated fibrosis, and improvements in overall renal function (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). Preclinical studies conducted in diabetic models have shown that chronic treatment with MCC950 leads to marked improvements in histopathological kidney damage, as evidenced by reduced mesangial expansion and decreased podocyte injury (Zhang et al., 2019). In addition, rodent studies in salt-sensitive hypertensive models reveal that inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome via MCC950 results in lower blood pressure, decreased interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, and reduced collagen deposition in renal tissues (Krishnan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2025). Although robust evidence from animal studies supports its efficacy in models of chronic kidney disease (CKD), clinical translation remains limited with only sparse early-phase clinical trials referenced in the literature (ClinicalTrials.gov). Additionally, the favorable safety profile observed in non-human primate studies further underpins its potential for repurposing in CKD, although more clinical data are needed to fully establish its benefit–risk profile.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nMCC950’s mechanism of action is both specific and well-characterized at the molecular level. The compound exerts its inhibitory effect by directly binding to the Walker B motif located within the NACHT domain of the NLRP3 protein. This binding interferes with the ATP hydrolysis that is essential for NLRP3 activation and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Under normal pathological conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC and the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form. Active caspase-1 then processes pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature forms and also initiates gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death. By preventing ATP hydrolysis, MCC950 locks NLRP3 in an inactive conformation, thereby obstructing the assembly of the entire inflammasome complex, reducing caspase-1 activation and cytokine maturation (Kim et al., 2019; Zhan et al., 2023). In the context of human tubular epithelial cells (TECs), which express NLRP3 and contribute to renal inflammatory cascades, MCC950’s engagement with the Walker B motif is proposed to significantly curb inflammasome formation. Such direct target engagement has been validated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and mutagenesis assays that confirm the drug’s specificity and potency. Blocking inflammasome assembly not only reduces cytokine release but also limits the formation of gasdermin D pores that are responsible for pyroptotic cell death, thereby preventing tubular cell loss and reducing interstitial inflammation (Liu et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven its robust preclinical evidence, the expected effect of MCC950 in assays focusing on CKD and related kidney injury is multifaceted. In in vitro models using human TECs, the hypothesis is that treatment with MCC950 will prevent ATP hydrolysis, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. As a result, the maturation and release of IL-1β and IL-18 will be significantly reduced, ultimately leading to lower levels of pyroptosis, attenuation of inflammation, and prevention of the fibrotic remodeling that often accompanies progressive CKD (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). In vivo, these effects are anticipated to manifest as decreased proteinuria, improved kidney function markers, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, and lower extracellular matrix deposition. This translates into a reduction in renal interstitial fibrosis and a preservation of normal tubular architecture, thereby ameliorating the progressive decline in renal function seen in CKD models. The expression profile of NLRP3 in TECs, coupled with its established role in mediating inflammatory and fibrotic responses, provides a solid rationale for targeting NLRP3 in chronic kidney disease (Zhang et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). The proposed mechanism is in alignment with the pathological features of CKD, where sustained low-grade inflammation and fibrosis lead to irreversible kidney damage.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nMCC950 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease due to several compelling strengths. First, its rational design as a selective NLRP3 inhibitor ensures that it directly targets a critical inflammatory pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of CKD. The extensive preclinical evidence in diverse animal models—from diabetic nephropathy to salt-sensitive hypertension and adenine-induced renal failure—strongly supports its renoprotective effects, including reductions in proteinuria, improved renal function, and diminished fibrotic remodeling (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Sabra et al., 2023). Second, the detailed elucidation of its molecular mechanism—confirming binding to the Walker B motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ATP hydrolysis—provides a clear mechanistic rationale that is essential for translational development (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Third, its favorable pharmacological properties, including oral bioavailability and a safety profile established in non-human primates, further underline its developmental feasibility (Kaur et al., 2025; ClinicalTrials.gov).  \n\nHowever, there are some potential weaknesses that must be carefully considered. Although rodent models have provided robust efficacy data, the translation of these effects to humans remains to be fully validated. There is a paucity of comprehensive clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with MCC950, which introduces uncertainty regarding its efficacy and potential off-target effects in a human patient population. Additionally, while the compound is highly selective for the NLRP3 inflammasome, it is critical to further elucidate its long-term safety and impact on global immune function, given the essential role of inflammasomes in host defense. In some experimental contexts, there has been variability in the inhibition of inflammation and fibrosis depending on the specific disease model, suggesting that its therapeutic window may differ based on disease etiology (Sabra et al., 2023). Despite these challenges, the overall evidence supports the further development of MCC950 as a mechanistic intervention in CKD, particularly in settings where inflammasome-driven pathology is predominant.\n\nIn summary, MCC950 is a well-characterized, rationally designed NLRP3 inhibitor with strong preclinical evidence demonstrating its renoprotective effects in various models of chronic kidney disease. Its specific binding to the Walker B motif of the NLRP3 NACHT domain and subsequent inhibition of ATP hydrolysis form the basis of its mechanism, reducing caspase-1 activation, IL-1β/IL-18 maturation, and gasdermin-D-mediated pyroptosis. These actions are expected to translate into reduced tubular epithelial cell death, diminished interstitial inflammation, and alleviation of fibrotic remodeling—key pathological processes in CKD progression. While further clinical validation is necessary, the strengths in mechanistic rationale, preclinical efficacy data, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties position MCC950 as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Coll et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022).\n\nReferences  \nColl, R.

"(VX-765, 5)","(Disulfiram, 0)","Both candidates target pyroptosis/inflammasome pathways to mitigate CKD progression by reducing inflammatory cell death and cytokine release, but they differ markedly in the strength of direct CKD evidence, mechanism specificity, and risk profiles. Candidate 1, disulfiram, is an ALDH inhibitor with off-target thiol reactivity that has shown efficacy in sepsis and ischemia–reperfusion AKI models via covalent inactivation of GSDMD. It benefits from decades of human safety data, oral bioavailability, and a clear downstream mechanism inhibiting pore formation. However, its direct data in chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis models are lacking, and its broad thiol reactivity raises concerns about off-target toxicity and immune suppression when chronically dosed in CKD. Dose optimization and long-term safety in the renal context remain uncharacterized. Candidate 2, VX-765 (Belnacasan), is an orally bioavailable prodrug that selectively and irreversibly inhibits caspase-1, blocking both IL-1β/IL-18 maturation and GSDMD cleavage upstream of pore formation. It has advanced into Phase II trials for nonrenal inflammatory conditions, establishing human safety and target engagement, and has demonstrated direct efficacy in rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction, showing reduced cytokine levels, macrophage infiltration, and fibrosis. While long-term caspase-1 inhibition raises theoretical concerns about compensatory pathways and host defense, its selectivity and existing clinical dosing data provide a clearer translational path. Overall, VX-765 offers stronger, CKD-relevant preclinical evidence, a more specific mechanism with fewer off-target liabilities, and an established human safety profile.","VX-765 outperforms disulfiram because it has direct preclinical efficacy in CKD models (diabetic nephropathy, UUO), a highly specific upstream mechanism of caspase-1 inhibition that both blocks cytokine maturation and prevents pyroptotic pore formation, and Phase II human safety data in other inflammatory diseases. Disulfiram’s promising AKI data and well-known safety are tempered by limited CKD‐specific data, broad thiol reactivity with off-target risks, and unknown chronic‐dosing parameters for renal protection. The weight of CKD‐relevant evidence and translational readiness firmly favors VX-765 as the superior candidate.",29,"(0, 5)","{'hypothesis': 'Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nDisulfiram is a synthetic small‐molecule drug originally discovered more than seventy years ago and is well known for its unique chemical structure featuring a tetraethylthiuram disulfide core. It is typically synthesized via the oxidation of diethyldithiocarbamate salts derived from the reaction of carbon disulfide with diethylamine, producing a compound with a central disulfide bond that confers its thiol‐reactive properties (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13). Chemically, disulfiram belongs to the dithiocarbamate family and is classified pharmacologically as an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor. Historically, this inhibition of ALDH has been the molecular basis for its clinical application as an alcohol aversion agent, where disulfiram induces the accumulation of acetaldehyde following alcohol ingestion, causing an assortment of discomforting physiological effects such as flushing, nausea, and tachycardia (Lu et al., 2021, p. 12). More recently, however, disulfiram has assumed a new identity in drug repurposing initiatives; its ability to interact covalently with cysteine residues in target proteins – a consequence of its thiuram disulfide structure – has attracted considerable attention in the context of inflammatory diseases. In particular, its capacity to interfere with the function of gasdermin D (GSDMD) via covalent modification is emerging as a promising mechanism by which disulfiram could counteract pathological inflammatory pathways (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4). This newly recognized activity places disulfiram within a therapeutic class of established drugs that are being re‐evaluated beyond their original indications, seeking to exploit their long clinical history and known safety profiles for novel applications such as the modulation of pyroptosis in inflammatory pathologies like chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nDisulfiram has a long-established history, primarily being used in the management of chronic alcohol use disorder since its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the early 1950s. As a stand‐alone therapy, its effectiveness in producing a pronounced aversive reaction to ethanol intake has made it a mainstay in addiction medicine. Over the decades, disulfiram has been administered safely to vast numbers of patients – a fact that is of critical importance when considering repurposing efforts, as its pharmacokinetics, dosing parameters, and toxicity profiles are well documented (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3). In addition to its established role in alcohol abstinence, disulfiram has been repurposed for a number of other applications. Emerging investigations have highlighted its promising activity in malignancies, where disulfiram, often in conjunction with supplemental copper, has demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against cancer stem cells via mechanisms that involve proteasome inhibition and modulation of redox homeostasis (Lu et al., 2021, pp. 13–14; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). More recently, its anti-inflammatory potential has been explored in the context of infectious diseases and systemic inflammatory responses. For instance, disulfiram has been evaluated in sepsis models, where its inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis led to reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines and improved survival in animal models (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). In models of ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), disulfiram pretreatment was shown to ameliorate renal dysfunction and histological damage by suppressing the noncanonical caspase-11–GSDMD inflammatory axis (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6). Although direct clinical studies of disulfiram in chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis remain limited, the encouraging preclinical signals from acute kidney insults and its capacity to modulate cell death pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation suggest that disulfiram—and its metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate—might be effective in attenuating the injurious inflammatory cascades observed in CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, the repurposing hypothesis for disulfiram in chronic kidney disease centers on its recently identified inhibitory effect on gasdermin D (GSDMD), a pore-forming effector protein that is indispensable for the execution of pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory, lytic form of programmed cell death triggered by the activation of inflammasomes. When these multiprotein complexes form in response to pathogenic stimuli or sterile injury, they lead to the activation of inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1, and in noncanonical pathways, caspase-4/5/11. These enzymes cleave GSDMD to generate an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) that oligomerizes and inserts into the plasma membrane to form pores, thereby releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) into the extracellular milieu (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17). Disulfiram has been shown to block this crucial terminal step in pyroptosis by covalently modifying a conserved cysteine residue (Cys191 in human GSDMD and Cys192 in murine GSDMD) through a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. This chemical modification prevents the oligomerization and subsequent membrane pore formation by GSDMD, thereby directly inhibiting the execution phase of pyroptosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). Moreover, disulfiram’s activity is potentiated in the presence of copper ions, which may stabilize its reactive metabolites such as diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC), enhancing its inhibitory potency in cellular assays (Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18). The outcome of this inhibition is a significant reduction in the pyroptotic cell death cascade, as evidenced by decreased IL-1β release and overall attenuation of inflammatory signaling. In the context of the kidney, specifically within tubular epithelial cells (TECs), the inflammatory microenvironment driven by inflammasome activation is one of the critical factors in the progression from acute injury to chronic fibrosis. TECs are known to express inflammasome components and are susceptible to pyroptosis, which contributes to interstitial inflammation and fibrogenesis (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Therefore, by inhibiting the cleavage and activation of GSDMD in these cells, disulfiram has the potential to preserve tubular integrity and prevent the inflammatory cascade that ultimately drives chronic kidney injury.\n\nExpected Effect:  \nBased on the proposed hypothesis and data from related inflammatory and renal injury models, disulfiram is predicted to exert a protective effect in the setting of chronic kidney disease by targeting the final common pathway of pyroptotic cell death. In a typical in vitro assay using primary tubular epithelial cells or established TEC lines, treatment with disulfiram at concentrations within the non-cytotoxic range (e.g., 0.1–5 µM as indicated in hypoxia/reoxygenation models) is expected to prevent the formation of GSDMD pores, thereby reducing cell membrane disruption, limiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18), and preserving cell viability (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11). The expected molecular signature following disulfiram treatment would include decreased levels of cleaved (active) GSDMD, reduced caspase-11 activation along with lower concentrations of circulating cytokines, as well as preserved markers of epithelial cell integrity. Given that GSDMD and components of the inflammasome are expressed in tubular epithelial cells (as supported by studies focusing on renal inflammatory pathways; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 7–9; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 9–10), the inhibition of GSDMD pore formation directly addresses a mechanistic driver of tubular injury. This would translate into reduced interstitial inflammation and limited myofibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition, which are critical steps in the fibrotic process that underpins CKD progression (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Ultimately, the expectation is that a therapeutic regimen involving disulfiram may slow or even halt the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease by mitigating the damaging effects of pyroptosis.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nDisulfiram presents several attractive features as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. The strengths of disulfiram include:  \n1. A well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profile, supported by decades of clinical use in alcohol aversion therapy, which facilitates rapid translation into new clinical contexts (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Lu et al., 2021, p. 12).  \n2. A clear and innovative mechanism of action based on the inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis. This mechanism is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of CKD, where inflammasome activation and resultant pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells contribute to interstitial inflammation and fibrosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11).  \n3. The potential for its active metabolite, diethyldithiocarbamate, and the enhancing role of copper complexation to improve its potency as a pyroptosis inhibitor further bolster the therapeutic rationale (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18; Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34).  \n4. Preclinical evidence in models of acute kidney injury (ischemia-reperfusion injury) demonstrates that disulfiram can ameliorate renal dysfunction through inhibition of the caspase-11–GSDMD axis, suggesting that similar effects may be achieved in chronic inflammatory settings underlying CKD (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11).  \n\nHowever, there are also potential weaknesses and gaps that warrant further exploration:  \n1. Despite promising preclinical data in acute injury models and other inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, direct evidence of disulfiram’s efficacy in chronic kidney disease models remains limited. The available studies do not present long-term data specific to CKD or renal fibrosis, which is critical for validating its use in a chronic condition (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6).  \n2. While the mechanism of covalent modification of GSDMD at Cys191 is well supported by molecular studies, the extrapolation of these findings to tubular epithelial cells in the kidney (as opposed to macrophages or other inflammatory cells) requires additional confirmation. It is essential to verify that TECs exhibit similar susceptibility to the gasdermin D inhibitory effects of disulfiram under pathological conditions (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n3. Dosage optimization, chronic toxicity assessments, and potential off-target effects in the renal context have not yet been extensively characterized. Although the historical human use of disulfiram supports a favorable safety profile, the dosing regimen for CKD might differ from that used for alcohol aversion therapy, given the distinct pharmacodynamics required to inhibit pyroptosis in kidney tissues (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8).  \n4. Another consideration is the effect of systemic modulation of pyroptosis. Since pyroptosis is integral to effective immune responses under certain circumstances, indiscriminate long-term inhibition could potentially compromise host defenses against infections. This balance between therapeutic efficacy in CKD and preservation of necessary immune functions must be carefully evaluated in preclinical models and eventually in clinical trials (Hu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n\nIn summary, disulfiram emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease due to its novel mechanism of targeting gasdermin D-induced pyroptosis—a pathway that is increasingly recognized as a critical driver of renal inflammation and fibrogenesis. Its long clinical history, established oral bioavailability, and well-characterized safety profile offer substantial advantages that could accelerate its translation into CKD-focused studies. The evidence from acute kidney injury models and inflammatory disease research forms a strong mechanistic rationale for its use to preserve tubular epithelial integrity and mitigate interstitial inflammation. Nevertheless, further detailed studies are imperative to validate its effectiveness in chronic kidney models, delineate optimal dosing strategies, and ensure that the inhibition of pyroptosis does not adversely affect normal immune surveillance. Based on the data reviewed—from biochemical studies demonstrating covalent modification of GSDMD (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8) to preclinical studies in renal injury models (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6)—the overall evaluation supports continued investigation of disulfiram as a repurposed agent in CKD. Its potential to modulate a critical pathogenic pathway in chronic kidney injury could represent a novel therapeutic intervention that merits further preclinical and clinical development (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18).\n\nReferences  \nCai, Q., Sun, Z., Xu, S., Jiao, X., Guo, S., Li, Y., Wu, H., & Yu, X.

It belongs to the class of caspase-1 inhibitors, which are designed to target the proteolytic enzyme caspase‐1 responsible for the post-translational processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Originally discovered through efforts to identify small molecules that could modulate inflammasome-mediated inflammation, VX-765 was synthesized to covalently interact with the catalytic cysteine residue of caspase‐1 and thereby block its activity. This group of compounds is part of a broader category of anti-inflammatory agents that have been applied in conditions where excessive inflammasome activation leads to tissue damage, and they have been used in clinical studies for disorders such as epilepsy and psoriasis, demonstrating that this drug class can effectively modulate immune signaling pathways and cytokine maturation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nVX-765 has an established history in preclinical and early clinical research. It has advanced into Phase II trials in both epilepsy and psoriasis, conditions associated with chronic inflammation and abnormal cytokine signaling, thereby establishing a safety profile and demonstrating adequate target engagement in humans. Although it has not been widely evaluated in clinical trials specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), preclinical studies conducted in rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) have demonstrated that VX-765 effectively reduces markers of inflammation such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), diminishes macrophage infiltration, and reduces collagen deposition, which are indicative of reduced fibrotic remodeling in the kidney (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024). Additionally, the general class of caspase-1 inhibitors has been successfully applied in various inflammatory conditions, and mechanistic studies suggest that inhibiting caspase-1 can interrupt the cascade leading to pyroptotic cell death—a key factor in inflammatory tissue damage. Although there is no large-scale clinical trial data in CKD to date, the compound’s mechanism, coupled with existing human safety data from other indications, strongly supports its rapid repurposing potential for kidney diseases (Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nVX-765’s mechanism of action is centered on the selective inhibition of caspase-1, an essential enzyme involved in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, and in mediating a form of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that VX-765 is a prodrug that is metabolized into VRT-043198, which binds irreversibly to the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys285) in the active site of caspase-1 through covalent interactions. Structural analyses, including crystallography experiments, have elucidated that VRT-043198 makes additional hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with key residues (e.g., R179, Q283, P343, and R383) ensuring a high degree of selectivity for inflammatory caspases over apoptotic caspases (Yang, 2019). By blocking caspase-1, VX-765 prevents the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active cytokine forms, thereby reducing the release of these potent inflammatory mediators; it also prevents the cleavage of gasdermin D, a critical effector protein required to form membrane pores that mediate pyroptotic cell death. In renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and other cell types implicated in kidney disease, such proclivity for pyroptosis can drive local inflammatory cascades and fibrotic signaling, so inhibiting caspase-1 may mitigate these processes (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). The specificity of VX-765 for caspase-1 has been confirmed through both in vitro assays—with assessments of IL-1β release and gasdermin D cleavage—and in vivo models where administration of VX-765 led to reduced serum IL-1β, improved survival in sepsis models, and attenuation of inflammatory tissue injury (Yang, 2019; Liu et al., 2023).\n\nExpected Effect in Chronic Kidney Disease:  \nIn the context of Chronic Kidney Disease, particularly conditions characterized by diabetic nephropathy and renal fibrosis, the hypothesis is that VX-765 will reduce caspase-1 mediated pyroptosis and subsequent inflammatory cytokine release in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). TEC pyroptosis contributes to tubular cell death and triggers a deleterious inflammatory milieu that ultimately drives fibrotic remodeling through the activation of myofibroblasts and increased deposition of extracellular matrix components such as collagen. VX-765 is expected to block this cascade at an early step by preventing the activation of caspase-1, thereby limiting IL-1β and IL-18 maturation and secretion. This, in turn, should reduce the recruitment and activation of inflammatory macrophages—a process that has been shown to contribute to fibrogenesis in the kidney (Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Preclinical evidence from rodent models supports that administration of VX-765 leads to decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced expression of pro-fibrotic markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and a lower deposition of collagen, thereby preserving renal tubular structure and function. Considering caspase-1 and the inflammasome complex are expressed in renal cells including TECs and resident macrophages, targeting caspase-1 is a rational approach to interrupt the feedback loop between cell death and inflammation that exacerbates CKD progression (Zhou & Li, 2023; Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of VX-765 as a therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease include its well-defined mechanism of action, oral bioavailability, and the fact that it has already undergone Phase II clinical trials in other indications, demonstrating an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in humans. The mechanistic rationale is strong: by targeting caspase-1, VX-765 interrupts the inflammasome-driven cascade responsible for both pyroptotic cell death and the maturation of key pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in renal fibrosis. Preclinical models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction have provided promising evidence that caspase-1 inhibition can reduce renal inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and extracellular matrix deposition, suggesting that VX-765 might slow the progression of fibrotic changes in CKD (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). Furthermore, targeting a central mediator such as caspase-1 may have broader benefits by influencing several downstream inflammatory pathways simultaneously, thus potentially overcoming the limitations of therapies that target individual cytokines.  \nWeaknesses include the translational gap that currently exists between preclinical efficacy in rodent models and clinical benefit in human CKD patients. Although VX-765 has demonstrated safety in epilepsy and psoriasis trials, the long-term effects of inhibiting caspase-1 in a chronic disease setting like CKD are not fully understood, particularly given the complex roles that inflammasome signaling may play in tissue repair, host defense, and kidney homeostasis. There is also the possibility that fully inhibiting caspase-1 could lead to compensatory activation of alternative inflammatory pathways or unintended off-target effects, especially in patients with compromised kidney function. Additionally, while preclinical data are encouraging, there is a need for dedicated clinical trials in CKD and related fibrotic conditions to establish the optimal dosing, efficacy, and safety profile in this specific patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).  \nOverall, VX-765 exhibits several promising attributes as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for CKD: its defined molecular target, demonstrated anti-inflammatory mechanism through caspase-1 inhibition, and supportive preclinical evidence of renoprotection provide a compelling rationale for further investigation. The strengths of existing human safety data and oral administration combine with a robust mechanistic framework to justify advancing VX-765 into clinical trials in patients with CKD. Nonetheless, further research is required to clarify long-term effects on renal function, potential compensatory inflammatory mechanisms, and the detailed pharmacodynamics in the setting of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. With carefully designed clinical studies focusing on renal endpoints, VX-765 could represent a valuable addition to the therapeutic arsenal against CKD, particularly for patients whose disease is driven significantly by inflammasome-mediated inflammation and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

"(OLT1177, 8)","(Brilliant Blue G, 1)","Both candidates aim to mitigate CKD progression by interrupting inflammasome-driven inflammation and fibrosis, but they differ significantly in mechanism, translational evidence, and development status. Candidate 1, Brilliant Blue G (BBG), is a well-characterized P2X7 receptor antagonist with solid preclinical data in UUO, hypertensive nephropathy, and lupus nephritis rodent models showing reduced IL-1β, macrophage infiltration, and fibrosis. It benefits from an established safety record as a surgical dye and CNS tool. However, BBG’s systemic pharmacokinetics, optimal dosing for chronic systemic administration, and chronic safety in CKD settings remain untested. Moreover, P2X7 antagonism represents an upstream and potentially redundant entry point for NLRP3 priming, as alternative ATP-independent inflammasome triggers can bypass P2X7 blockade. Candidate 2, OLT1177 (dapansutrile), is a direct, selective inhibitor of NLRP3 that binds the NACHT domain to prevent oligomerization and ASC recruitment. It has been advanced through Phase I and Phase IIa trials in humans (acute gout, heart failure) demonstrating safety, tolerability, oral bioavailability, and target engagement. Preclinical studies in diabetic nephropathy and crystal nephropathy models report robust reductions in renal IL-1β, pyroptosis, macrophage infiltration, and fibrotic markers. OLT1177’s direct blockade of the core inflammasome assembly, proven human ADME/PK, and established chronic dosing potential give it a more compelling translational profile than BBG’s indirect, rodent-only evidence and uncertain systemic use. Both candidates have novelty, but OLT1177 balances innovation with clinical feasibility more effectively.","OLT1177 is superior because its MoA directly targets the NLRP3 inflammasome, the central driver of IL-1β–mediated inflammation and fibrogenesis in CKD. It has robust human safety and PK data supporting chronic oral administration, and preclinical renal models corroborate its efficacy. In contrast, BBG—while mechanistically plausible—relies on upstream P2X7 antagonism subject to pathway redundancy, lacks human systemic dosing data, and has unknown long-term safety in CKD populations. Thus, OLT1177 presents a clearer path to clinical translation and higher probability of success.",30,"(1, 8)","{'hypothesis': 'Brilliant Blue G (BBG; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #B0770)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Brilliant Blue G (BBG; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #B0770)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nBrilliant Blue G (BBG) is a synthetic dye originally developed for use in food and as a surgical visualizing agent that has been repurposed as a pharmacological agent. BBG is part of the broad class of blue dyes that have been extensively studied for their ability to interact with the purinergic receptor family, most notably acting as a non‐competitive antagonist of the P2X7 receptor. The compound’s chemical structure confers high water solubility and the ability to be administered at defined doses with a favorable safety profile, as demonstrated by its routine use in ophthalmic surgery and CNS studies without systemic toxicity. In its role as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, BBG has been used in various preclinical studies investigating inflammatory and cell death pathways. Its synthetic origin and established manufacturing process, as offered by suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #B0770), support its scalability for repurposing in chronic diseases. BBG belongs to a class of small molecules that modulate ion channel function, particularly by binding to the ATP‐activated P2X7 receptor, which has been implicated in various inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. This class of compounds has been employed not only for their staining properties but also for their ability to interfere with cellular signaling events related to inflammation, rendering them of considerable interest in conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD) where inflammation and fibrosis are critical pathogenic factors (Ferreira et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nHistorically, Brilliant Blue G has been most widely recognized as a histological staining agent with established safety in both preclinical and clinical contexts, particularly within the neuroprotective field. Its pharmacological actions extend to antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, and preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in animal models of inflammatory diseases, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and various neurodegenerative conditions. More recently, BBG has been evaluated in rodent models of kidney disease. For example, in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) models—a widely used experimental model that mimics tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis—BBG treatment has been observed to reduce inflammation, diminish interstitial fibrosis, and promote tubular cell regeneration (Pereira et al., 2020). In rodent hypertensive nephropathy models, BBG has also been reported to modulate renal vascular resistance and alter tubular injury markers, suggesting that its renoprotective effects might extend to a broader spectrum of CKD–related pathologies. Although clinical trials directly targeting chronic kidney disease with BBG have not yet been detailed in the public literature, searches in ClinicalTrials.gov using terms related to “Brilliant Blue G OR P2X7 antagonist OR P2X7 inhibitor OR NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have identified several ongoing studies investigating similar P2X7 blockade strategies in CKD, which support the translational potential of this approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Prior investigations in animal models of lupus nephritis and hypertensive kidney disease have indicated that BBG’s anti‐inflammatory profile, including decreased IL-1β levels and reduced macrophage infiltration, is conducive to preventing progressive renal damage (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020). Veterinary and preclinical applications in models of inflammatory injury provide a solid foundation for repurposing BBG as a potential therapeutic candidate in conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, such as CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe mechanism by which BBG is hypothesized to exert its renoprotective effects in CKD is centered on its ability to non‐competitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor present on both renal immune and epithelial cells. The P2X7 receptor is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated cation channel that is activated under pathophysiological conditions where extracellular ATP levels are elevated, which frequently occurs during tissue injury and inflammation. Once activated, the P2X7 receptor facilitates the formation of pores in the plasma membrane that allow for the influx of cations and the efflux of cellular contents, thereby precipitating a cascade of intracellular events. One critical downstream consequence of P2X7 activation is the priming and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that, upon activation, recruits the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and pro-caspase-1. This assembly leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase-1, which in turn processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, resulting in their secretion and the amplification of the inflammatory response. Moreover, P2X7 activation can induce pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that further exacerbates tissue injury and inflammation (Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nBBG exerts its effects via a noncompetitive blockade of the P2X7 receptor. In doing so, BBG prevents ATP-induced ion channel opening, thereby blocking the subsequent calcium influx and pore formation that are necessary for downstream inflammasome priming. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that BBG inhibits P2X7 receptor-mediated responses, including the calcium influx and the release of IL-1β from macrophages and other immune cells. In vitro studies with BBG have revealed nanomolar potency in blocking P2X7-mediated activities, which is reflective of its efficacy in dampening the inflammasome-related cytokine cascades (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019). Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that BBG may also interfere with pannexin-1 channels that are thought to facilitate ATP release and further promote inflammasome activation, although the precise relationship between pannexin-1 and P2X7 remains the subject of active research (Ferreira et al., 2016). Consequently, by inhibiting the P2X7 receptor, BBG blocks the ATP-driven initiation of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade. This blockade limits caspase-1 activation and the subsequent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, ultimately reducing local inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrotic remodeling within the renal parenchyma. Evidence from animal models indicates that such inhibition leads to reduced macrophage infiltration, decreased fibrogenic markers, and enhanced tubular cell regeneration, which collectively preserve the integrity of the tubulointerstitial architecture (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the established mechanistic pathway, BBG is expected to exert multifaceted renoprotective effects when applied to models of chronic kidney disease. In the proposed assay evaluating drug effects on renal cells, the expected outcome would involve a significant reduction in ATP-induced inflammasome activation. Specifically, by antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, BBG should lower the levels of active caspase-1, thereby reducing the maturation and extracellular release of IL-1β. This attenuation of inflammasome activation is expected to diminish pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells and mitigate pro-inflammatory cytokine release from resident macrophages. BBG’s inhibition of these pathways would theoretically preserve tubular architecture and limit interstitial fibrosis—a hallmark of progressive CKD. The renoprotective effect is anticipated to be observed as decreased expression of fibrosis markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and heat shock protein-47 (HSP47), as well as reduced collagen deposition, as evidenced in rodent models of UUO and hypertensive nephropathy (Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nAt the molecular level, renal epithelial cells, particularly proximal tubular cells, express both P2X7 receptors and components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Immunohistochemical studies in animal models have demonstrated that under pathological conditions, P2X7 receptor expression is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells and can lead to enhanced production of IL-1β when activated by extracellular ATP (Arulkumaran, 2016; Howarth, 2020). Therefore, BBG is expected to be especially effective in cell types that are critical in the development of inflammation and fibrosis in CKD. By reducing the number of inflammatory cells (such as CD68-positive macrophages) infiltrating the renal parenchyma and by limiting cell death via pyroptosis, BBG may also indirectly reduce the fibrotic signaling that is mediated by cytokines such as TGF-β. This dual effect—both direct inhibition of inflammatory signaling and preservation of renal cell integrity—provides a compelling rationale for BBG’s use in preventing the progression of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nMoreover, BBG’s known safety profile in central nervous system studies and its extensive use as a surgical dye underscore its translational potential. Its water solubility and known pharmacokinetics facilitate dosing strategies that could be adapted for chronic administration in CKD patients. Additionally, the indirect suppression of inflammasome activation through P2X7 antagonism presents a novel approach to modulating the inflammatory microenvironment in the kidney, one that targets a critical nexus of inflammation and fibrosis (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, BBG presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on its ability to noncompetitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor, thereby blocking ATP-induced inflammasome priming and activation. The strengths of BBG include its well-established safety profile, water solubility, and proven efficacy in various rodent models of kidney injury such as hypertensive nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction. Preclinical data indicate that BBG can reduce key mediators of inflammation such as IL-1β, lower caspase-1 activation, and mitigate the deleterious effects of pyroptosis on renal tubular architecture, all of which are central to the pathophysiology of CKD (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain that warrant further investigation. There is limited direct clinical data specifically evaluating BBG in human CKD patients, although the identification of related clinical trials targeting P2X7 and NLRP3 receptors in CKD suggests active interest in this therapeutic approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while BBG’s mechanism of action is well supported by in vitro and animal studies, the potential for differential effects based on receptor splice variants and cell type specificity in renal tissue must be carefully delineated. For instance, recent studies indicate that variations in P2X7 receptor expression and function in the renal vasculature may impact not only inflammatory signaling but also vascular tone, which could influence overall renal perfusion and function (Howarth, 2020).\n\nMoreover, while BBG’s indirect inhibition of the inflammasome pathway via P2X7 antagonism is mechanistically attractive, redundancy in inflammasome activation pathways—such as those that are P2X7-independent—might limit the overall efficacy of BBG as a monotherapy. Some studies have demonstrated that even with effective P2X7 inhibition, alternative pathways may still sustain IL-1β release under inflammatory conditions (Arulkumaran, 2016; Prendecki et al., 2022). Therefore, combination therapies that target multiple nodes in the inflammasome network may ultimately be required to achieve robust clinical benefit.\n\nIn terms of drug development strategies, BBG benefits from its established manufacturing and dosing data, which accelerates early phase clinical trial design and regulatory considerations. In addition, BBG has been successfully used in non-renal contexts—including long-term treatments in models of graft-versus-host disease—without significant toxicity, lending further support to its translational potential (Geraghty et al., 2019). The extensive literature on BBG’s anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in preclinical models provides a solid rationale for advancing this candidate for CKD even as further mechanistic and pharmacodynamic studies are conducted.\n\nWeaknesses of this candidate include the fact that while much of the preclinical data is encouraging, there is still a need for robust clinical trials that specifically assess BBG in CKD. Additionally, given the complexity of CKD pathogenesis—which involves multiple overlapping inflammatory and fibrotic signaling mechanisms—it will be important to determine whether BBG alone can induce sufficient therapeutic benefit or whether it is best applied as part of a combination regimen. Moreover, the potential vascular effects of P2X7 antagonism require further clarification to ensure that systemic hemodynamics are not adversely affected, particularly in patients with existing cardiovascular complications that often accompany CKD (Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall, the mechanistic rationale for BBG centers on its ability to interfere with a critical inflammatory pathway—namely, the ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. This blockade not only reduces the activation of caspase-1 and the release of IL-1β but also limits pyroptotic cell death, preservation of tubular architecture, and ultimately, fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. These effects address key pathogenic mechanisms underlying CKD progression. Moreover, aspects such as its water solubility, known dosing regimens from CNS and surgical applications, and favorable preclinical safety record render BBG an attractive candidate for fast-tracked repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Ferreira et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence reviewed indicates that Brilliant Blue G holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. Its mechanism—centered on noncompetitive antagonism of the P2X7 receptor and consequent suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade—offers a novel approach to preserving renal function by reducing inflammatory injury and fibrosis. While further research, particularly targeted clinical trials in the CKD patient population, is necessary to fully validate its efficacy and safety in this context, the preclinical data and extensive understanding of its molecular interactions support the continued development of BBG for CKD therapy (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nReferences  \nArulkumaran, N.

The compound was synthesized via a chemically directed approach—in particular, its synthesis involved an alkylation reaction of sodium methanesulfinate with 3-bromopropionitrile, yielding a β-sulfonyl nitrile moiety that confers its inhibitory activity (Marchetti et al., 2018). This class of small molecule inhibitors has been widely explored for targeting inflammatory pathways through modulation of innate immune responses. Historically, β-sulfonyl nitrile compounds have attracted attention as therapeutic agents due to their capacity to engage key protein domains involved in inflammation while maintaining selectivity and oral bioavailability, attributes that are critical for chronic treatment regimens (Marchetti et al., 2018).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOLT1177 has progressed through several stages of development and clinical evaluation in diseases characterized by uncontrolled inflammation, notably in acute gout flares, heart failure, and conditions linked to cytokine release syndromes. In Phase I clinical trials, dapansutrile demonstrated an excellent safety profile when administered to healthy subjects at dosages up to 1000 mg per day for 8 days, thereby establishing its tolerability and preliminary evidence of target engagement (Jansen et al., 2019). Moreover, therapeutic evaluations in inflammatory settings—such as a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study in patients with NYHA II–III systolic heart failure—further underscored its favorable safety profile and pharmacodynamic effects despite the fact that current clinical investigations have not directly targeted Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) populations (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical studies in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy have demonstrated that treatment with OLT1177 leads to significant reductions in renal IL-1β levels, decreased macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis, suggesting that its benefits extend to kidney-related inflammatory damage (Mulay, 2019). Although clinical trials specifically focused on CKD or renal inflammation are lacking at this point, the robust anti-inflammatory effects observed in related models and conditions provide a sound rationale for repurposing OLT1177 in chronic kidney disease.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, OLT1177 selectively inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by targeting its central NACHT domain, where it interferes with ATPase activity that is critical for the oligomerization process necessary for inflammasome assembly. Under normal conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggers the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), leading to the formation of a multi-protein complex that activates caspase-1 and drives the processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) (Kim et al., 2019). OLT1177 binds specifically to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, thereby blocking the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC, which is a necessary event for full inflammasome assembly (Marchetti et al., 2018). In doing so, it prevents the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-1 and effectively reduces the secretion of IL-1β. This mechanism is particularly significant in environments of hyperglycemic stress, where increased NLRP3 activity in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) drives inflammation, pyroptotic cell death, and subsequent tubulointerstitial fibrosis (Mulay, 2019). Additionally, by curtailing downstream cytokine release and pyroptosis, OLT1177 is believed to mitigate the metabolic cost of inflammation, an effect that has been observed in multiple preclinical in vivo studies in conditions ranging from acute arthritis to cardiac dysfunction (Jansen et al., 2019; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe central hypothesis is that through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, OLT1177 will effectively block the recruitment of ASC and disrupt subsequent caspase-1 activation in renal tubular cells, particularly under conditions of hyperglycemia which are common in diabetic nephropathy. Under hyperglycemic stress, renal tubular epithelial cells exhibit increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and aberrant inflammasome activation resulting in heightened secretion of IL-1β, a cytokine implicated in promoting fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition. By preventing the cleavage of pro-IL-1β into its active form, OLT1177 is expected to prevent pyroptotic cell death of TECs and interrupt the deleterious cycle of inflammation-driven fibrogenesis in the kidney (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Evidence from animal models indicates that selective blockade of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to a marked decrease in renal inflammation as evidenced by reduced macrophage infiltration and lower profibrotic cytokine levels, which supports the expectation that OLT1177 could yield appreciable renoprotective outcomes in CKD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In the proposed assay, it is anticipated that OLT1177 will reduce markers of inflammation such as IL-1β and IL-18 in the culture medium of hyperglycemia-stressed TECs, thereby correlating with decreased pyroptosis and improved cell viability. This would be further corroborated by downstream effects such as reduced activation of profibrotic pathways, including lower TGF-β signaling and diminished deposition of fibrotic markers, ultimately mitigating the progression toward renal fibrosis (Cliff, 2023; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate with substantial potential for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease owing to its well-characterized mechanism of action, favorable preclinical results, and established safety profile in early clinical studies. One of the major strengths of OLT1177 lies in its selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an attractive target given the critical role of NLRP3 in mediating renal inflammation, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenesis. Its synthetic origins and robust medicinal chemistry underpin its precise targeting of the NACHT domain in NLRP3, effectively sparing other inflammasomes and reducing the risk of broad immunosuppression (Marchetti et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Furthermore, its oral bioavailability and metabolic stability make it suitable for chronic administration, an essential consideration for CKD where long-term therapy is required (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nFrom a therapeutic history perspective, although OLT1177 has not yet been directly tested in human CKD patient populations, its successful progression through Phase I trials for conditions such as gout and heart failure, combined with promising data in animal models of crystal nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy, strongly supports its potential utility in renal settings (Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019). Preclinical studies show reduced renal IL-1β secretion, diminished macrophage infiltration, and attenuated fibrogenesis when NLRP3 is inhibited by agents like OLT1177, lending biological credence to the hypothesis that inflammasome inhibition could slow CKD progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nAt the molecular level, the precise action of OLT1177—binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ASC recruitment—represents a highly targeted approach that contrasts with cytokine-neutralizing therapies such as anti-IL-1β antibodies. This specificity is advantageous because it not only prevents the generation of IL-1β but also curtails the activation of NFκB and other downstream inflammatory cascades, potentially reducing off-target effects and preserving broader immune competence (Marchetti et al., 2018; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020). Additionally, the expected anti-inflammatory effects in renal tubular cells—specifically preventing pyroptosis and fibrogenesis—are consistent with literature demonstrating that NLRP3 is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells under hyperglycemic and inflammatory stress (Kim et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain. One of the limitations stems from the current lack of direct clinical evidence in CKD populations; while animal models provide a strong rationale, the translation of these findings into human CKD may be complicated by the multifactorial nature of the disease, where multiple pathways contribute to renal injury beyond inflammasome activation. Additionally, the chronic nature of CKD necessitates prolonged administration of therapeutic agents, and long-term safety data for OLT1177 in such a setting are still pending. There is also the possibility that inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome might impair necessary innate immune responses, although the specificity of OLT1177 for the NLRP3 complex—in contrast to more generalized anti-inflammatory agents—should, in theory, mitigate this concern (Seok et al., 2021).\n\nMoreover, while the preclinical data in models of diabetic nephropathy and crystal-induced kidney injury are promising, variability in genetic and environmental factors in human CKD could affect the compound’s efficacy. It will therefore be critical to design dedicated clinical trials in defined CKD populations, ideally incorporating biomarkers of inflammasome activity, such as circulating IL-1β and IL-18 levels, as well as imaging and functional assessments of renal fibrosis and function. The anti-fibrotic effects, in particular, warrant closer mechanistic studies to confirm that inhibition of TEC pyroptosis and preservation of tubular integrity occur in the human kidney as they do in animal models (Williams et al., 2022; Cliff, 2023).\n\nIn conclusion, OLT1177 (dapansutrile) represents a compelling candidate for repurposing in Chronic Kidney Disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, favorable pharmacological profile, and preclinical evidence supporting its renoprotective effects. Its ability to directly inhibit the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding to the NACHT domain and blocking ASC recruitment addresses a critical upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that leads to caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and subsequent pyroptosis of renal tubular cells. This mode of action has the potential to attenuate the inflammation-driven fibrogenesis that is central to CKD progression, particularly in diabetic nephropathy where hyperglycemic stress is a key driver of renal injury.\n\nStrengths of OLT1177 include its synthetic origin allowing for structural optimization, its demonstrated safety in Phase I clinical trials, its oral bioavailability which is advantageous for chronic therapy, and its selective inhibitory action that minimizes off-target effects. Additionally, existing preclinical studies showing reduced renal IL-1β, diminished macrophage infiltration, and lowered fibrotic responses in models of nephropathy provide a promising foundation for further exploration in CKD (Mulay, 2019; Jansen et al., 2019).\n\nWeaknesses or challenges include the current absence of dedicated clinical trials in CKD, the complexity of CKD pathophysiology where multiple inflammatory and fibrotic pathways are involved, and the potential risk that chronic inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome could in some contexts compromise the host defense or alter essential cellular processes. These concerns underscore the need for carefully designed preclinical studies specifically in renal disease models, followed by early phase clinical trials in well-defined CKD populations to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and long-term safety.\n\nOverall, based on the comprehensive literature review, the mechanistic rationale, and the encouraging preclinical and early clinical data available, OLT1177 shows significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease. The next steps should involve further detailed studies in CKD-specific preclinical models that assess not only inflammatory cytokine modulation but also functional outcomes such as glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria reduction, and fibrosis attenuation. A robust clinical development program targeting patients with diabetic nephropathy and other forms of CKD characterized by inflammasome activation would be the logical progression to validate its clinical utility (Marchetti et al., 2018; Jansen et al., 2019; Mulay, 2019).\n\nReferences  \nCliff, C.

It belongs to the class of caspase-1 inhibitors, which are designed to target the proteolytic enzyme caspase‐1 responsible for the post-translational processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Originally discovered through efforts to identify small molecules that could modulate inflammasome-mediated inflammation, VX-765 was synthesized to covalently interact with the catalytic cysteine residue of caspase‐1 and thereby block its activity. This group of compounds is part of a broader category of anti-inflammatory agents that have been applied in conditions where excessive inflammasome activation leads to tissue damage, and they have been used in clinical studies for disorders such as epilepsy and psoriasis, demonstrating that this drug class can effectively modulate immune signaling pathways and cytokine maturation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nVX-765 has an established history in preclinical and early clinical research. It has advanced into Phase II trials in both epilepsy and psoriasis, conditions associated with chronic inflammation and abnormal cytokine signaling, thereby establishing a safety profile and demonstrating adequate target engagement in humans. Although it has not been widely evaluated in clinical trials specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), preclinical studies conducted in rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) have demonstrated that VX-765 effectively reduces markers of inflammation such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), diminishes macrophage infiltration, and reduces collagen deposition, which are indicative of reduced fibrotic remodeling in the kidney (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024). Additionally, the general class of caspase-1 inhibitors has been successfully applied in various inflammatory conditions, and mechanistic studies suggest that inhibiting caspase-1 can interrupt the cascade leading to pyroptotic cell death—a key factor in inflammatory tissue damage. Although there is no large-scale clinical trial data in CKD to date, the compound’s mechanism, coupled with existing human safety data from other indications, strongly supports its rapid repurposing potential for kidney diseases (Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nVX-765’s mechanism of action is centered on the selective inhibition of caspase-1, an essential enzyme involved in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, and in mediating a form of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that VX-765 is a prodrug that is metabolized into VRT-043198, which binds irreversibly to the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys285) in the active site of caspase-1 through covalent interactions. Structural analyses, including crystallography experiments, have elucidated that VRT-043198 makes additional hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with key residues (e.g., R179, Q283, P343, and R383) ensuring a high degree of selectivity for inflammatory caspases over apoptotic caspases (Yang, 2019). By blocking caspase-1, VX-765 prevents the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active cytokine forms, thereby reducing the release of these potent inflammatory mediators; it also prevents the cleavage of gasdermin D, a critical effector protein required to form membrane pores that mediate pyroptotic cell death. In renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and other cell types implicated in kidney disease, such proclivity for pyroptosis can drive local inflammatory cascades and fibrotic signaling, so inhibiting caspase-1 may mitigate these processes (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). The specificity of VX-765 for caspase-1 has been confirmed through both in vitro assays—with assessments of IL-1β release and gasdermin D cleavage—and in vivo models where administration of VX-765 led to reduced serum IL-1β, improved survival in sepsis models, and attenuation of inflammatory tissue injury (Yang, 2019; Liu et al., 2023).\n\nExpected Effect in Chronic Kidney Disease:  \nIn the context of Chronic Kidney Disease, particularly conditions characterized by diabetic nephropathy and renal fibrosis, the hypothesis is that VX-765 will reduce caspase-1 mediated pyroptosis and subsequent inflammatory cytokine release in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). TEC pyroptosis contributes to tubular cell death and triggers a deleterious inflammatory milieu that ultimately drives fibrotic remodeling through the activation of myofibroblasts and increased deposition of extracellular matrix components such as collagen. VX-765 is expected to block this cascade at an early step by preventing the activation of caspase-1, thereby limiting IL-1β and IL-18 maturation and secretion. This, in turn, should reduce the recruitment and activation of inflammatory macrophages—a process that has been shown to contribute to fibrogenesis in the kidney (Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Preclinical evidence from rodent models supports that administration of VX-765 leads to decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced expression of pro-fibrotic markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and a lower deposition of collagen, thereby preserving renal tubular structure and function. Considering caspase-1 and the inflammasome complex are expressed in renal cells including TECs and resident macrophages, targeting caspase-1 is a rational approach to interrupt the feedback loop between cell death and inflammation that exacerbates CKD progression (Zhou & Li, 2023; Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of VX-765 as a therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease include its well-defined mechanism of action, oral bioavailability, and the fact that it has already undergone Phase II clinical trials in other indications, demonstrating an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in humans. The mechanistic rationale is strong: by targeting caspase-1, VX-765 interrupts the inflammasome-driven cascade responsible for both pyroptotic cell death and the maturation of key pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in renal fibrosis. Preclinical models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction have provided promising evidence that caspase-1 inhibition can reduce renal inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and extracellular matrix deposition, suggesting that VX-765 might slow the progression of fibrotic changes in CKD (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). Furthermore, targeting a central mediator such as caspase-1 may have broader benefits by influencing several downstream inflammatory pathways simultaneously, thus potentially overcoming the limitations of therapies that target individual cytokines.  \nWeaknesses include the translational gap that currently exists between preclinical efficacy in rodent models and clinical benefit in human CKD patients. Although VX-765 has demonstrated safety in epilepsy and psoriasis trials, the long-term effects of inhibiting caspase-1 in a chronic disease setting like CKD are not fully understood, particularly given the complex roles that inflammasome signaling may play in tissue repair, host defense, and kidney homeostasis. There is also the possibility that fully inhibiting caspase-1 could lead to compensatory activation of alternative inflammatory pathways or unintended off-target effects, especially in patients with compromised kidney function. Additionally, while preclinical data are encouraging, there is a need for dedicated clinical trials in CKD and related fibrotic conditions to establish the optimal dosing, efficacy, and safety profile in this specific patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).  \nOverall, VX-765 exhibits several promising attributes as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for CKD: its defined molecular target, demonstrated anti-inflammatory mechanism through caspase-1 inhibition, and supportive preclinical evidence of renoprotection provide a compelling rationale for further investigation. The strengths of existing human safety data and oral administration combine with a robust mechanistic framework to justify advancing VX-765 into clinical trials in patients with CKD. Nonetheless, further research is required to clarify long-term effects on renal function, potential compensatory inflammatory mechanisms, and the detailed pharmacodynamics in the setting of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. With carefully designed clinical studies focusing on renal endpoints, VX-765 could represent a valuable addition to the therapeutic arsenal against CKD, particularly for patients whose disease is driven significantly by inflammasome-mediated inflammation and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

As a kaurane-type diterpenoid, its structure comprises four isoprene units arranged into a characteristic tetracyclic skeleton, which is emblematic of this class of natural products. The compound’s discovery and development emerged from the long-standing tradition of using Rabdosia rubescens (also known as Donglingcao) in Asian folk medicine, where it was historically applied for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In the broader context of drug development, diterpenoids such as oridonin have been recognized for their “drug-like” properties; they have provided scaffolds for synthetic modifications aimed at improving potency, solubility, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Moreover, the extraction and study of oridonin reflect an important paradigm in natural products research, wherein historical use is validated and expanded upon with modern medicinal chemistry techniques. This compound, commercially available from suppliers like Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #O2015), fits well within the class of small-molecule natural products that have been repurposed for modern therapeutic applications in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases (Ding et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOridonin’s use spans a broad spectrum of therapeutic applications. Traditionally, the herbal preparations containing oridonin were employed in Chinese medicine to alleviate conditions ranging from pharyngitis and gingivitis to various inflammatory and tumorous conditions. With the advent of modern biochemical and pharmacological research, oridonin has been extensively studied for its anticancer efficacy; many preclinical studies have demonstrated its capacity to induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and suppress metastasis in a variety of cancer cell lines (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In addition to its anticancer properties, several studies have documented oridonin’s robust anti-inflammatory actions. Notably, oridonin has shown efficacy in experimental models of colitis and gout through its inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that mediates the maturation of IL-1β and is a critical driver of inflammatory responses (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020). Although most of the historical and ongoing research has emphasized oridonin’s anticancer and acute inflammatory indications, there is emerging interest in its potential role in renal pathologies. A search on ClinicalTrials.gov using terms such as “Oridonin AND kidney OR renal OR chronic kidney disease OR glomerulonephritis OR proteinuria OR glomerular” returned tens of thousands of trials, indicating significant research activity into natural products and potentially repurposed compounds for kidney diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, to date there is limited direct clinical evidence of oridonin being deployed specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preclinical studies, particularly those involving rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and ischemia–reperfusion injury, have demonstrated renoprotective effects such as reduced inflammatory cytokine levels, diminished fibrosis markers, and improved renal function parameters; these effects suggest that oridonin or its derivatives might be promising candidates for treating CKD or similar renal conditions (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, oridonin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects primarily through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex known to activate caspase-1 and mediate the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. Recent mechanistic studies have shown that oridonin covalently binds to cysteine 279 within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, a critical residue required for the ATPase activity of NLRP3 and its subsequent oligomerization (He et al., 2018). This binding effectively prevents the conformational changes necessary for the recruitment of NEK7, thereby halting inflammasome assembly and activation. In macrophages, this inhibition leads to a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and attenuates inflammatory cell recruitment—a mechanism that has been validated through pull‐down assays and mass spectrometry, which demonstrated nanomolar potency of oridonin in suppressing NLRP3 activation (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020).\n\nBeyond its direct interaction with the NLRP3 inflammasome, oridonin has been shown to modulate additional signaling pathways. For example, it can inhibit NF-κB and p38-MAPK activation, further blunting the inflammatory response, and it has been implicated in the activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidative defenses at lower concentrations, contributing to its cytoprotective effects (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019). These multifaceted actions underscore the polypharmacological nature of oridonin: while its primary mode of action appears to involve covalent modification of NLRP3, its downstream effects extend into a broader anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative network. This convergence on inflammatory signaling pathways is particularly relevant because overactivation of the inflammasome and subsequent pyroptotic cell death are implicated not only in acute inflammatory diseases but also in chronic fibrotic processes within the kidney (Ding et al., 2020).\n\nExpanding the context to renal pathology, the hypothesis driving our proposal is that human podocytes—which are essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier—express components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of NLRP3 in these cells has been linked to pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, which in turn contributes to podocyte loss, proteinuria, and interstitial fibrosis, all hallmarks of CKD. Although most direct evidence of oridonin’s NLRP3 inhibition comes from studies in immune cells like macrophages (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2016), the underlying mechanism is conserved across cell types. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that oridonin could similarly inhibit NLRP3 activation in podocytes, thereby preventing inflammasome assembly, blocking caspase-1 activation, and ultimately reducing the release of IL-1β (Li et al., 2021). By precluding these downstream events, oridonin may attenuate the cycle of inflammatory damage and fibrosis that underpins progressive renal injury in CKD (Li et al., 2021).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the proposed assays and eventual in vivo models of chronic kidney disease, the expected effect of oridonin centers on its ability to protect podocytes from NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated injury. More specifically, by covalently binding to cysteine 279 in NLRP3, oridonin is anticipated to inhibit ATP hydrolysis and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex. This mechanistic blockade should result in a reduction of caspase-1 activation—a key step in the maturation of IL-1β—and thereby diminish the secretion of this potent pro-inflammatory cytokine (He et al., 2018). In podocytes, such suppression is expected to reduce pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death that directly compromises the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and leads to proteinuria. Preservation of podocyte viability would, in turn, help maintain glomerular barrier integrity, minimizing the leakage of plasma proteins into the urine and limiting the ensuing fibrotic response in the renal interstitium (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nMoreover, the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB and p38-MAPK signaling pathways could provide additional benefits by reducing overall renal inflammation. In animal models of kidney injury—such as those induced by ischemia–reperfusion or diabetic nephropathy—treatment with compounds that inhibit these pathways has been correlated with improved renal function parameters (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021). Therefore, beyond its direct effect on podocyte inflammasome activity, oridonin may exert broader renoprotective actions by dampening inflammatory cascades that contribute to interstitial fibrosis and progressive renal insufficiency. In this context, oridonin’s oral bioavailability and established history in traditional medicine support the feasibility of translating these preclinical findings into clinical benefit for CKD patients (Su et al., 2024).\n\nIt is important to note that while direct evidence of oridonin’s effects on human podocytes remains to be fully elucidated, the expression of NLRP3 in podocytes has been demonstrated in experimental models of CKD. Additionally, studies involving natural products that inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome—such as fucoidan in diabetic kidney disease—have provided supportive mechanistic insights, suggesting that the targeting of inflammasome activation in podocytes is a viable therapeutic strategy (Wang et al., 2022).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nOverall, oridonin emerges as a compelling therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease, given its well-documented mechanism of inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome and its extensive background in modulating inflammatory pathways. Its natural origin and historical use in traditional Chinese medicine provide a robust basis for its safety profile, and preclinical studies have demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, including models of colitis, gout, and even acute kidney injury (Ding et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2021). Strengths of oridonin include its specificity for NLRP3 via covalent binding to a critical cysteine residue, which has been shown to yield nanomolar potency in relevant assays (He et al., 2018). Additionally, oridonin’s ability to modulate secondary pathways (NF-κB, p38-MAPK, and Nrf2) may amplify its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective benefits, addressing multiple facets of CKD pathophysiology ranging from podocyte loss to interstitial fibrosis (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nHowever, several weaknesses must also be considered. Despite promising preclinical data in other disease models, direct evidence for oridonin’s efficacy in modulating NLRP3 activation specifically in podocytes remains limited. Most mechanistic studies have been conducted in macrophages or other cell types, and while the extrapolation is reasonable given the conserved nature of inflammasome signaling, dedicated studies using human podocytes are needed to substantiate the proposed protective effects on proteinuria and interstitial fibrosis (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Furthermore, issues such as moderate potency, limited solubility, and variable bioavailability have been noted with oridonin, necessitating further formulation and structural optimization to ensure therapeutic efficacy in a clinical setting (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). These pharmacokinetic considerations are particularly critical for a chronic indication like CKD, where long-term dosing and sustained target engagement are required.\n\nAnother consideration is the translation of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects observed in acute injury models or non-renal tissue into the context of chronic kidney disease, which involves complex and multifactorial pathophysiology. Although the suppression of inflammasome-driven pyroptosis is a promising target for preventing podocyte injury, CKD progression involves additional factors such as hemodynamic stress, metabolic derangements, and immune dysregulation that may not be fully addressed by NLRP3 inhibition alone (Huang et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2020). Consequently, while the mechanistic specificity of oridonin is appealing, its efficacy in a multifaceted chronic disease state like CKD requires rigorous preclinical validation followed by carefully designed clinical trials.\n\nIn summary, oridonin holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease based on its robust anti-inflammatory mechanism, particularly its ability to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome via covalent binding to cysteine 279. The compound’s multifaceted mechanism—encompassing inhibition of caspase-1 activation, IL-1β maturation, and subsequent pyroptosis—could translate into preservation of podocyte integrity, reduction in proteinuria, and attenuation of interstitial fibrosis, all of which are critical endpoints in CKD management (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Nonetheless, challenges related to drug solubility, bioavailability, and the direct demonstration of efficacy in podocytes must be addressed. Given its strong preclinical validation in other inflammatory conditions, further targeted studies focusing on its renal effects and optimization of drug-like properties are warranted before it can be advanced as a viable treatment for CKD (Tan et al., 2021; Su et al., 2024). Overall, while there is a clear mechanistic rationale supporting the therapeutic potential of oridonin in CKD, additional studies specifically assessing its effects in relevant renal cell types and chronic disease models will be critical to fully validate its clinical utility.\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

"(Tranilast, 3)","(CY-09, 7)","Both candidates target the NLRP3 inflammasome, a validated driver of renal inflammation and fibrosis in CKD. Tranilast has a dual mechanism—direct disruption of NLRP3–ASC/NEK7 interactions and inhibition of TGF-β/PDGF fibrotic signaling—supported by preclinical studies in diabetic nephropathy and UUO models showing reduced proteinuria, collagen deposition, and improved histology. Its decades-long clinical use as an anti-allergic agent confers a well-characterized human safety/tolerability profile and established oral bioavailability. However, the precise binding site and affinity for NLRP3 require further structural confirmation, and no CKD-specific clinical trials have been registered. CY-09 offers a highly specific, structure-based mechanism by competitively blocking ATP binding at NLRP3’s Walker A motif. In vitro and in vivo data demonstrate potent nanomolar inhibition of IL-1β/IL-18 secretion and pyroptosis in macrophages, with efficacy in sepsis, colitis, and metabolic disease models. Oral bioavailability and safety in rodents are favorable. Nonetheless, CY-09 lacks direct CKD model validation, and off-target risks associated with ATP-binding enzymes remain to be fully profiled. Moreover, it has no human clinical experience. Tranilast’s broader anti-fibrotic actions and proven human safety accelerate translational feasibility, while CY-09’s specificity and potency present an attractive but less mature candidate.","While CY-09’s precise NLRP3 inhibition is scientifically compelling, Tranilast’s dual anti-inflammatory/anti-fibrotic MoA, direct evidence in renal disease models, and extensive human safety record give it a higher probability of success and faster translational path in CKD. The repurposing of an approved drug with known pharmacokinetics and clinical tolerability outweighs the novelty advantage of CY-09 at this stage.",32,"(3, 7)","{'hypothesis': 'Tranilast (MedChemExpress, catalog #HY-50819)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Tranilast (MedChemExpress, catalog #HY-50819)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nTranilast, commercially available from MedChemExpress (catalog #HY-50819), is a small-molecule synthetic compound originally developed as an anti-allergic agent. Chemically, it is an anthranilic acid derivative, specifically N-[3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl]-anthranilic acid, synthesized initially to treat allergic conditions such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and cutaneous disorders, including keloids and hypertrophic scars (Gilbert et al., 2012). The compound belongs to a class of agents that modulate inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways. The early synthesis of tranilast involved modifying the cinnamoyl anthranilate moiety to enhance potency against pro-fibrotic mediators like transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) while maintaining an acceptable toxicity profile. Over time, the compound’s anti-allergic properties were expanded by preclinical findings that demonstrated its potential to inhibit fibrotic changes via modulation of cytokine signaling and cellular proliferation pathways. This class of anthranilic acid derivatives has been used both in dermatologic and immunologic contexts, providing a background of clinical utility and safety that benefits the repurposing efforts for conditions such as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nTranilast has a well-documented history in clinical settings as an anti-allergic drug since its introduction in Japan decades ago. Its traditional indications have included treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and prevention of keloid formation. More recently, emerging preclinical studies have evaluated tranilast for its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in multiple organ systems. Notably, in experimental animal models of renal disease, tranilast has been investigated in contexts such as diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In these models, tranilast demonstrated the ability to reduce proteinuria, improve kidney structural integrity, and diminish collagen deposition (Gilbert et al., 2012). For instance, in diabetic nephropathy studies, tranilast reduced albuminuria and slowed the decline in glomerular filtration rate through attenuation of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix accumulation. Additionally, human studies in early-stage CKD patients, particularly those with diabetic nephropathy, receiving tranilast combined with standard therapies such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs have shown reductions in urinary markers like collagen type IV and albumin excretion (Gilbert et al., 2012). Beyond renal applications, the compound’s repurposing has been explored in cardiovascular contexts and even in certain inflammatory conditions driven by aberrant inflammasome activation, suggesting a versatility that supports further investigation into its utility against CKD. However, review of ClinicalTrials.gov did not reveal any registered trials directly assessing tranilast in CKD or related renal fibrosis, indicating that while preclinical and limited clinical observations are encouraging, robust clinical evaluation in CKD remains to be undertaken (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe hypothesized mechanism for tranilast in CKD centers on its ability to inhibit key inflammatory and fibrotic processes via direct intervention in inflammasome biology. Tranilast’s molecular target is the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex that plays a pivotal role in innate inflammatory responses. The assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires a coordinated interaction among NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and the serine/threonine kinase NEK7. Activation of this complex ultimately leads to the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form, which subsequently processes pro-IL-1β into IL-1β, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that drives pyroptosis and contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Specifically, tranilast is proposed to disrupt the critical interactions between NLRP3 and ASC as well as between NLRP3 and NEK7. This disruption is believed to occur via direct binding to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3, which is essential for its oligomerization and subsequent recruitment of ASC. By preventing ASC oligomerization, tranilast effectively halts the assembly of the inflammasome, thereby blocking caspase-1 activation and reducing IL-1β secretion (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).\n\nIn addition to inflammasome disruption, tranilast has been shown to attenuate TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling—another major contributor to kidney disease progression. TGF-β is well documented as a central mediator of extracellular matrix synthesis and fibroblast activation, and its overexpression in chronic kidney injury drives interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. Tranilast’s inhibition of TGF-β signaling includes the suppression of Smad2 phosphorylation and downstream fibrotic responses, leading to reductions in collagen deposition and interstitial matrix accumulation (Gilbert et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2019). Furthermore, tranilast’s capacity to inhibit PDGF signaling reduces mesangial cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in the renal glomerulus, providing an additional mechanistic avenue through which it exerts its renoprotective effects (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the proposed mechanism, the expected effect of tranilast in a CKD context is to attenuate tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis by mitigating both inflammatory and fibrotic signaling. In tubular epithelial cells (TECs), oxidative stress triggers activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in IL-1β secretion and pyroptotic cell death—a process that not only damages the epithelial barrier but also leads to further recruitment of inflammatory cells. By interfering with the NLRP3–ASC and NLRP3–NEK7 interactions, tranilast is anticipated to reduce caspase-1 activation. Consequently, a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis is expected, which would alleviate tubular inflammation under conditions of oxidative stress (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).\n\nFurthermore, the reduction in IL-1β and subsequent dampening of the inflammatory cascade should also lead to a decrease in TGF-β release. TGF-β is critically involved in driving fibroblast activation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. Thus, by curtailing the initial inflammasome-mediated inflammatory trigger, tranilast indirectly reduces TGF-β levels, thereby preventing its downstream pro-fibrotic effects. This is particularly relevant in diabetic nephropathy and UUO models, where TGF-β-mediated fibrosis is a major determinant of disease progression (Chen et al., 2020; Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nIn summary, the expected outcome in an in vitro or in vivo CKD assay would be a demonstrable decrease in markers of inflammation (such as IL-1β levels), reduced caspase-1 activity, diminished pyroptosis (as measured by LDH release or similar assays), and lowered expression of fibrotic markers including collagen, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Moreover, the preservation of tubular epithelial cell integrity and a consequent improvement in overall kidney function would provide functional support for tranilast’s therapeutic efficacy in CKD (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nTranilast represents a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease based on its dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. From a mechanistic standpoint, its ability to selectively disrupt the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting key protein–protein interactions (specifically between NLRP3, ASC, and NEK7) underpins its potential to reduce caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. This targeted mechanism is particularly attractive because it distinguishes tranilast from broader-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs that may have off-target effects. Moreover, by concurrently attenuating TGF-β signaling pathways, tranilast can reduce fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition—both critical contributors to the progression of CKD (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019).\n\nA major strength of tranilast is its established clinical use as an anti-allergic agent over several decades, which provides a substantial record of safety and tolerability in humans. Its oral dosing regimen further facilitates rapid clinical repurposing for CKD. Preclinical studies in animal models of diabetic nephropathy and UUO have demonstrated measurable benefits, such as reduced proteinuria and improved renal histology, lending support to its potential efficacy in human CKD (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nHowever, there are certain weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Despite promising preclinical data, there is a noted absence of registered clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with tranilast (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), which indicates that further clinical validation is required. Moreover, while tranilast’s inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is supported by various mechanistic studies, the precise molecular details—such as confirmation of binding to the LRR domain of NLRP3 and the exact nature of its impact on NEK7 interactions—require further elucidation through biochemical and structural studies (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). In addition, as with any repurposed drug, careful evaluation of potential off-target immunomodulatory effects is necessary. There have been reports of immune-mediated adverse events in other clinical indications, which, although not prominent, must be monitored during chronic administration in CKD patients (Strilchuk et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, the body of preclinical literature strongly supports the hypothesis that tranilast can disrupt NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and attenuate subsequent inflammatory and fibrotic cascades in the kidney. Given its dual mechanism—inhibiting both inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion and TGF-β–mediated fibrosis—tranilast emerges as an attractive candidate for repurposing in CKD. Its established use in other indications and favorable oral bioavailability further underscore its potential for rapid clinical translation. Nonetheless, the lack of direct clinical trial evidence in renal disease and the need for further mechanistic clarification represent critical challenges that the research team must address in subsequent studies (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023). Overall, the strengths of mechanistic specificity and a well-established safety profile position tranilast as a promising drug candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease, warranting further investigation through comprehensive preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials.\n\nReferences  \nChen, S., Wang, Y., Pan, Y., Liu, Y., Zheng, S., Ding, K., Mu, K., Yuan, Y., Li, Z., Song, H., Jin, Y., & Fu, J.

Advance online publication. https://doi.org/10.3892/ijmm.2023.5238', 'index': '3'}","{'hypothesis': 'CY-09 (Selleckchem, catalog #S8614)', 'answer': 'Proposal for CY-09 (Selleckchem, catalog #S8614)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nCY-09 is a synthetic, small-molecule inhibitor discovered through a focused drug development campaign that initially screened analogs of CFTR inhibitors (specifically C172) and later optimized them to generate compounds with potent and selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Chemically, CY-09 belongs to the class of thiazolidinone derivatives, a category known for its capacity to interfere with enzymatic activities via covalent or non-covalent interactions. Its development was driven by the need to specifically target the ATP-binding site within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, particularly focusing on the Walker A motif—a conserved nucleotide-binding region that is essential for the ATPase activity required for NLRP3 oligomerization. The design rationale behind CY-09 was based on structure-based drug design principles, where the compound was engineered to directly bind NLRP3, thereby preventing the conformational changes necessary for inflammasome assembly. This chemical class has previously been used in various contexts to modulate protein–enzyme interactions, and its application in inflammasome biology represents an evolution of this approach to target excessive inflammation mediated by the innate immune system (Jiang et al., 2017; Bertinaria et al., 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of CY-09 is rooted in preclinical studies where it has been extensively characterized in vitro and in animal models of inflammatory diseases. Initially, CY-09 demonstrated potent inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in murine bone marrow–derived macrophages stimulated with canonical activators such as ATP, nigericin, and monosodium urate crystals, showing a dose-dependent reduction in IL-1β secretion and caspase-1 activation. Its efficacy has been documented in rodent models of sepsis and colitis, as well as in metabolic disorder models where NLRP3-driven inflammation is a core pathological feature. Although no clinical trials having been completed in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) specifically have been reported to date, the compound’s inclusion in multiple clinical trial searches (ClinicalTrials.gov) indicates that there is active interest in repurposing or further evaluating NLRP3 inhibitors like CY-09 in kidney-related conditions. Furthermore, the extensive body of work demonstrating that NLRP3 knockout or pharmacological inhibition confers protection against renal fibrosis, tubular inflammation, and other hallmarks of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Zhou & Li, 2023) supports the translational potential of a molecule such as CY-09. Historically, similar NLRP3 inhibitors (for example, MCC950) have been applied in various preclinical models of inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and their protective effects in conditions like diabetic nephropathy and ischemia-reperfusion injury provide a strong rationale for applying CY-09 in CKD (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nCY-09 exerts its therapeutic action by directly binding to the NLRP3 protein at its NACHT domain, specifically targeting the Walker A (or P-loop) motif responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis. This binding event competitively inhibits ATP from accessing the site, thereby blocking the ATPase activity essential for NLRP3 oligomerization. Without ATP hydrolysis, NLRP3 is unable to undergo the conformational rearrangements necessary for the aggregation of multiple NLRP3 molecules into the inflammasome complex. Consequently, the formation of the adaptor protein ASC specks is prevented, leading to a blockade of pro-caspase-1 activation and subsequent cleavage into its active form. This chain of events ultimately results in a reduction of the maturation and secretion of the central proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and it halts gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis—a form of lytic, inflammatory cell death that substantially contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis in CKD. Importantly, studies have demonstrated that CY-09 does not interfere with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, underscoring its molecular specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2019). The molecular interaction of CY-09 is supported by biotinylated pull-down assays which confirm its selective binding to NLRP3 over other inflammasome components, and computational docking models corroborate a binding mode that is competitive with ATP at the Walker A motif (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017). This detailed molecular mechanism signifies that CY-09 operates at an early and critical step in the inflammasome pathway, making it a highly attractive candidate for diseases with a significant inflammatory component, such as CKD (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe proposed hypothesis for applying CY-09 to CKD is that by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in human proximal tubular epithelial cells, the compound will inhibit ATPase-driven oligomerization of NLRP3, thereby reducing the formation of ASC specks, the activation of caspase-1, and the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. The downstream effect of blocking these events is the inhibition of gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis, which is known to drive tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrotic remodeling—a central hallmark in the progression of CKD. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, NLRP3 is expressed and activated in response to various stress stimuli, including oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and metabolic dysregulation, all of which are common in CKD pathogenesis. By impeding this pathway, CY-09 is expected to diminish inflammatory cytokine secretion and reduce cell death, thereby preserving tubular integrity, minimizing interstitial inflammation, and preventing the fibrotic changes that culminate in renal function decline (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Data from preclinical models of kidney injury, such as those using MCC950 and other NLRP3 knockout models, have consistently shown improvements in renal structure and function, and reduction in profibrotic markers upon inhibition of the NLRP3 pathway (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017). Furthermore, oral bioavailability and a favorable safety profile in rodent studies enhance the clinical feasibility of CY-09 as a repurposed agent for CKD (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The expected effects in a CKD model would therefore include reduced extracellular matrix deposition, lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the renal interstitium, and overall attenuation of the fibrotic process, translating ultimately into stabilization of renal function (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nBased on the comprehensive literature review, CY-09 emerges as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease. One of its greatest strengths lies in its robust and specific mechanism of action; by directly binding to the Walker A motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3, CY-09 efficiently prevents the initial ATP-driven steps that are critical for inflammasome assembly. This targeted inhibition ensures that downstream activation events—namely ASC speck formation, caspase-1 activation, and subsequent IL-1β/IL-18 maturation—are effectively suppressed. Such specificity is critical for minimizing off-target effects, as CY-09 has shown no significant interference with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, which could reduce undesirable immunosuppressive side effects (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The repurposing strategy is further supported by extensive preclinical evidence indicating that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 results in marked protection against renal fibrosis and inflammation in various CKD models. The preclinical efficacy of similar NLRP3 inhibitors such as MCC950 in models of diabetic nephropathy, cisplatin-induced renal injury, and ischemia-reperfusion injury reinforces the therapeutic potential of targeting NLRP3 in kidney disease (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017).\n\nAnother significant strength of CY-09 is its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile in rodent studies, which is an important consideration for chronic administration required in CKD therapy (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). This pharmacokinetic profile, along with the compound’s high potency in inflammatory assays where nanomolar inhibitory effects have been observed, provides confidence that CY-09 could achieve therapeutically effective concentrations in the kidney without systemic toxicity.\n\nHowever, there are also challenges and uncertainties. Although extensive preclinical studies in inflammatory disease models support the potential of CY-09, direct evidence of its efficacy in chronic kidney disease models specifically remains limited. The majority of studies to date have focused on sepsis, metabolic disorders, and murine colitis rather than on kidney-specific outcomes. There is, therefore, a need for more targeted preclinical research in CKD models—including those mimicking diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and cisplatin-induced renal fibrosis—to definitively establish the renoprotective effects of CY-09 (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Additionally, while the mechanism is well-characterized in immune cells like macrophages, further studies need to elucidate its effects specifically in human proximal tubular epithelial cells and other renal cell types that contribute to CKD progression. Such studies should evaluate not only biochemical markers of inflammasome activation but also functional outcomes like proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate, and histological indices of fibrosis.\n\nAnother potential weakness concerns the translational gap between rodent models and human CKD. The pathophysiology of CKD is multifactorial, and while NLRP3-mediated inflammation is a key driver, the disease process involves many convergent signaling pathways including TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling and oxidative stress pathways. It is possible that the blockade of NLRP3 alone may not be sufficient to fully arrest disease progression in humans. In addition, although CY-09 appears selective based on current evidence, there is always the risk of off-target effects when a compound modulates ATPase activity, given the abundance of ATP-binding proteins in the cell. Careful profiling of CY-09 against a broad spectrum of other ATPases and kinases will be necessary to confirm its selectivity in a clinical setting (Sandall et al., 2020).\n\nIn summary, CY-09 represents an innovative and mechanistically compelling therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease due to its direct inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a central mediator of renal inflammation and fibrosis. Its synthesis as a thiazolidinone derivative and its proven ability to bind the Walker A motif within the NACHT domain underscore its potential to precisely block inflammasome-driven pyroptosis. Preclinical evidence from models of various inflammatory conditions, along with robust biochemical data demonstrating nanomolar potency in macrophage assays, provides a strong rationale for its repurposing in kidney disease. Furthermore, its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety in rodent studies enhance its translational appeal. Nonetheless, additional research is needed to specifically validate its efficacy in CKD models, assess its long-term safety, and determine its pharmacodynamic effects in kidney-specific cell types such as proximal tubular epithelial cells. Overall, the strengths of CY-09’s targeted mechanism, coupled with supportive preclinical efficacy data from related inflammatory models, make it a promising candidate for further development and evaluation in Chronic Kidney Disease (ClinicalTrials.gov; Jiang et al., 2017; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nBertinaria, M., Gastaldi, S., Marini, E., & Giorgis, M.

"(Tranilast, 3)","(MCC950, 9)","Both candidates target the NLRP3 inflammasome and have preclinical evidence supporting renoprotective effects in CKD models. Tranilast (ID 3) is a repurposed anthranilic acid derivative with decades of clinical safety as an anti‐allergic agent and emerging data in diabetic nephropathy and UUO models showing reduced albuminuria, collagen deposition, and improved GFR. Its dual MoA—disruption of NLRP3–ASC/NEK7 interactions plus attenuation of TGF‐β/PDGF signaling—addresses both upstream inflammation and downstream fibrosis, and early human CKD signals (decreased urinary collagen IV and albumin excretion) support translational potential. However, the exact binding to the NLRP3 LRR domain needs further structural confirmation and dedicated CKD trials are lacking. MCC950 (ID 9) is a highly selective diarylsulfonylurea inhibitor that directly binds the Walker B motif in the NLRP3 NACHT domain, fully blocking ATP hydrolysis, oligomerization, caspase-1 activation, and IL-1β/IL-18 maturation. It has extensive, well‐characterized efficacy across multiple rodent CKD models (diabetic nephropathy, salt‐sensitive hypertension, adenine CKD) and validated target engagement by SPR and mutagenesis. Safety in nonhuman primates is favorable, but no human trials in CKD exist and long‐term immune effects remain to be defined. Both compounds are orally bioavailable and feasible for preclinical assays, yet MCC950’s tighter mechanistic definition increases confidence in experimental outcomes whereas Tranilast’s known human safety and preliminary CKD biomarker reductions give it an edge in translational viability.","Although MCC950 has the clearest, most selective MoA and robust preclinical efficacy in diverse CKD models, its human safety profile in CKD remains untested, adding translational risk. Tranilast combines dual anti-inflammasome and anti-fibrotic actions with an established clinical safety record and early human CKD signals, which greatly de‐risks clinical development. The existing human data on albuminuria and collagen markers, plus decades of tolerability, make Tranilast the more pragmatic choice for rapid translation into CKD therapy.",33,"(3, 9)","{'hypothesis': 'Tranilast (MedChemExpress, catalog #HY-50819)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Tranilast (MedChemExpress, catalog #HY-50819)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nTranilast, commercially available from MedChemExpress (catalog #HY-50819), is a small-molecule synthetic compound originally developed as an anti-allergic agent. Chemically, it is an anthranilic acid derivative, specifically N-[3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl]-anthranilic acid, synthesized initially to treat allergic conditions such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and cutaneous disorders, including keloids and hypertrophic scars (Gilbert et al., 2012). The compound belongs to a class of agents that modulate inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways. The early synthesis of tranilast involved modifying the cinnamoyl anthranilate moiety to enhance potency against pro-fibrotic mediators like transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) while maintaining an acceptable toxicity profile. Over time, the compound’s anti-allergic properties were expanded by preclinical findings that demonstrated its potential to inhibit fibrotic changes via modulation of cytokine signaling and cellular proliferation pathways. This class of anthranilic acid derivatives has been used both in dermatologic and immunologic contexts, providing a background of clinical utility and safety that benefits the repurposing efforts for conditions such as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nTranilast has a well-documented history in clinical settings as an anti-allergic drug since its introduction in Japan decades ago. Its traditional indications have included treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and prevention of keloid formation. More recently, emerging preclinical studies have evaluated tranilast for its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in multiple organ systems. Notably, in experimental animal models of renal disease, tranilast has been investigated in contexts such as diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In these models, tranilast demonstrated the ability to reduce proteinuria, improve kidney structural integrity, and diminish collagen deposition (Gilbert et al., 2012). For instance, in diabetic nephropathy studies, tranilast reduced albuminuria and slowed the decline in glomerular filtration rate through attenuation of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix accumulation. Additionally, human studies in early-stage CKD patients, particularly those with diabetic nephropathy, receiving tranilast combined with standard therapies such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs have shown reductions in urinary markers like collagen type IV and albumin excretion (Gilbert et al., 2012). Beyond renal applications, the compound’s repurposing has been explored in cardiovascular contexts and even in certain inflammatory conditions driven by aberrant inflammasome activation, suggesting a versatility that supports further investigation into its utility against CKD. However, review of ClinicalTrials.gov did not reveal any registered trials directly assessing tranilast in CKD or related renal fibrosis, indicating that while preclinical and limited clinical observations are encouraging, robust clinical evaluation in CKD remains to be undertaken (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe hypothesized mechanism for tranilast in CKD centers on its ability to inhibit key inflammatory and fibrotic processes via direct intervention in inflammasome biology. Tranilast’s molecular target is the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex that plays a pivotal role in innate inflammatory responses. The assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires a coordinated interaction among NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and the serine/threonine kinase NEK7. Activation of this complex ultimately leads to the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form, which subsequently processes pro-IL-1β into IL-1β, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that drives pyroptosis and contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Specifically, tranilast is proposed to disrupt the critical interactions between NLRP3 and ASC as well as between NLRP3 and NEK7. This disruption is believed to occur via direct binding to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3, which is essential for its oligomerization and subsequent recruitment of ASC. By preventing ASC oligomerization, tranilast effectively halts the assembly of the inflammasome, thereby blocking caspase-1 activation and reducing IL-1β secretion (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).\n\nIn addition to inflammasome disruption, tranilast has been shown to attenuate TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling—another major contributor to kidney disease progression. TGF-β is well documented as a central mediator of extracellular matrix synthesis and fibroblast activation, and its overexpression in chronic kidney injury drives interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. Tranilast’s inhibition of TGF-β signaling includes the suppression of Smad2 phosphorylation and downstream fibrotic responses, leading to reductions in collagen deposition and interstitial matrix accumulation (Gilbert et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2019). Furthermore, tranilast’s capacity to inhibit PDGF signaling reduces mesangial cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in the renal glomerulus, providing an additional mechanistic avenue through which it exerts its renoprotective effects (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the proposed mechanism, the expected effect of tranilast in a CKD context is to attenuate tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis by mitigating both inflammatory and fibrotic signaling. In tubular epithelial cells (TECs), oxidative stress triggers activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in IL-1β secretion and pyroptotic cell death—a process that not only damages the epithelial barrier but also leads to further recruitment of inflammatory cells. By interfering with the NLRP3–ASC and NLRP3–NEK7 interactions, tranilast is anticipated to reduce caspase-1 activation. Consequently, a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis is expected, which would alleviate tubular inflammation under conditions of oxidative stress (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).\n\nFurthermore, the reduction in IL-1β and subsequent dampening of the inflammatory cascade should also lead to a decrease in TGF-β release. TGF-β is critically involved in driving fibroblast activation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. Thus, by curtailing the initial inflammasome-mediated inflammatory trigger, tranilast indirectly reduces TGF-β levels, thereby preventing its downstream pro-fibrotic effects. This is particularly relevant in diabetic nephropathy and UUO models, where TGF-β-mediated fibrosis is a major determinant of disease progression (Chen et al., 2020; Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nIn summary, the expected outcome in an in vitro or in vivo CKD assay would be a demonstrable decrease in markers of inflammation (such as IL-1β levels), reduced caspase-1 activity, diminished pyroptosis (as measured by LDH release or similar assays), and lowered expression of fibrotic markers including collagen, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Moreover, the preservation of tubular epithelial cell integrity and a consequent improvement in overall kidney function would provide functional support for tranilast’s therapeutic efficacy in CKD (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nTranilast represents a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease based on its dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. From a mechanistic standpoint, its ability to selectively disrupt the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting key protein–protein interactions (specifically between NLRP3, ASC, and NEK7) underpins its potential to reduce caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. This targeted mechanism is particularly attractive because it distinguishes tranilast from broader-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs that may have off-target effects. Moreover, by concurrently attenuating TGF-β signaling pathways, tranilast can reduce fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition—both critical contributors to the progression of CKD (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019).\n\nA major strength of tranilast is its established clinical use as an anti-allergic agent over several decades, which provides a substantial record of safety and tolerability in humans. Its oral dosing regimen further facilitates rapid clinical repurposing for CKD. Preclinical studies in animal models of diabetic nephropathy and UUO have demonstrated measurable benefits, such as reduced proteinuria and improved renal histology, lending support to its potential efficacy in human CKD (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nHowever, there are certain weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Despite promising preclinical data, there is a noted absence of registered clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with tranilast (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), which indicates that further clinical validation is required. Moreover, while tranilast’s inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is supported by various mechanistic studies, the precise molecular details—such as confirmation of binding to the LRR domain of NLRP3 and the exact nature of its impact on NEK7 interactions—require further elucidation through biochemical and structural studies (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). In addition, as with any repurposed drug, careful evaluation of potential off-target immunomodulatory effects is necessary. There have been reports of immune-mediated adverse events in other clinical indications, which, although not prominent, must be monitored during chronic administration in CKD patients (Strilchuk et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, the body of preclinical literature strongly supports the hypothesis that tranilast can disrupt NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and attenuate subsequent inflammatory and fibrotic cascades in the kidney. Given its dual mechanism—inhibiting both inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion and TGF-β–mediated fibrosis—tranilast emerges as an attractive candidate for repurposing in CKD. Its established use in other indications and favorable oral bioavailability further underscore its potential for rapid clinical translation. Nonetheless, the lack of direct clinical trial evidence in renal disease and the need for further mechanistic clarification represent critical challenges that the research team must address in subsequent studies (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023). Overall, the strengths of mechanistic specificity and a well-established safety profile position tranilast as a promising drug candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease, warranting further investigation through comprehensive preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials.\n\nReferences  \nChen, S., Wang, Y., Pan, Y., Liu, Y., Zheng, S., Ding, K., Mu, K., Yuan, Y., Li, Z., Song, H., Jin, Y., & Fu, J.

It belongs to the diarylsulfonylurea class of compounds, which emerged from medicinal chemistry efforts that initially focused on sulfonylurea drugs such as glyburide. Glyburide was found to have anti‐inflammatory properties mediated by inhibition of the NLRP3 complex; however, its clinical utility as an anti-inflammatory agent was limited by its potent effects on insulin release and the consequent risk of hypoglycemia. To overcome these limitations, researchers refined the chemical structure and synthesized MCC950, a derivative that retains the inflammasome inhibitory activity of glyburide without disturbing insulin secretion. The design of MCC950 was based on structure–activity relationship studies that identified the importance of the diarylsulfonylurea moiety, and its eventual discovery positioned it as a gold-standard benchmark compound for NLRP3 inhibition (Kaur et al., 2025; Coll et al., 2019). This compound has been synthesized and purified by several vendors including Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #SML 2233), ensuring reproducibility and accessibility to research teams. Overall, MCC950 represents a promising example of rational drug design aimed at selectively targeting components of the innate immune system and addressing the inflammatory cascades that contribute to disease pathology.\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of MCC950 is marked by extensive preclinical evidence spanning animal models of a wide array of inflammatory disorders. Initially investigated in models of auto-inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, MCC950 quickly emerged as the benchmark inhibitor for studying NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated inflammation. In rodent models of kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, and adenine-induced chronic renal failure, MCC950 has demonstrated significant reductions in proteinuria, attenuated fibrosis, and improvements in overall renal function (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). Preclinical studies conducted in diabetic models have shown that chronic treatment with MCC950 leads to marked improvements in histopathological kidney damage, as evidenced by reduced mesangial expansion and decreased podocyte injury (Zhang et al., 2019). In addition, rodent studies in salt-sensitive hypertensive models reveal that inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome via MCC950 results in lower blood pressure, decreased interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, and reduced collagen deposition in renal tissues (Krishnan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2025). Although robust evidence from animal studies supports its efficacy in models of chronic kidney disease (CKD), clinical translation remains limited with only sparse early-phase clinical trials referenced in the literature (ClinicalTrials.gov). Additionally, the favorable safety profile observed in non-human primate studies further underpins its potential for repurposing in CKD, although more clinical data are needed to fully establish its benefit–risk profile.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nMCC950’s mechanism of action is both specific and well-characterized at the molecular level. The compound exerts its inhibitory effect by directly binding to the Walker B motif located within the NACHT domain of the NLRP3 protein. This binding interferes with the ATP hydrolysis that is essential for NLRP3 activation and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Under normal pathological conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC and the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form. Active caspase-1 then processes pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature forms and also initiates gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death. By preventing ATP hydrolysis, MCC950 locks NLRP3 in an inactive conformation, thereby obstructing the assembly of the entire inflammasome complex, reducing caspase-1 activation and cytokine maturation (Kim et al., 2019; Zhan et al., 2023). In the context of human tubular epithelial cells (TECs), which express NLRP3 and contribute to renal inflammatory cascades, MCC950’s engagement with the Walker B motif is proposed to significantly curb inflammasome formation. Such direct target engagement has been validated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and mutagenesis assays that confirm the drug’s specificity and potency. Blocking inflammasome assembly not only reduces cytokine release but also limits the formation of gasdermin D pores that are responsible for pyroptotic cell death, thereby preventing tubular cell loss and reducing interstitial inflammation (Liu et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven its robust preclinical evidence, the expected effect of MCC950 in assays focusing on CKD and related kidney injury is multifaceted. In in vitro models using human TECs, the hypothesis is that treatment with MCC950 will prevent ATP hydrolysis, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. As a result, the maturation and release of IL-1β and IL-18 will be significantly reduced, ultimately leading to lower levels of pyroptosis, attenuation of inflammation, and prevention of the fibrotic remodeling that often accompanies progressive CKD (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). In vivo, these effects are anticipated to manifest as decreased proteinuria, improved kidney function markers, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, and lower extracellular matrix deposition. This translates into a reduction in renal interstitial fibrosis and a preservation of normal tubular architecture, thereby ameliorating the progressive decline in renal function seen in CKD models. The expression profile of NLRP3 in TECs, coupled with its established role in mediating inflammatory and fibrotic responses, provides a solid rationale for targeting NLRP3 in chronic kidney disease (Zhang et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). The proposed mechanism is in alignment with the pathological features of CKD, where sustained low-grade inflammation and fibrosis lead to irreversible kidney damage.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nMCC950 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease due to several compelling strengths. First, its rational design as a selective NLRP3 inhibitor ensures that it directly targets a critical inflammatory pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of CKD. The extensive preclinical evidence in diverse animal models—from diabetic nephropathy to salt-sensitive hypertension and adenine-induced renal failure—strongly supports its renoprotective effects, including reductions in proteinuria, improved renal function, and diminished fibrotic remodeling (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Sabra et al., 2023). Second, the detailed elucidation of its molecular mechanism—confirming binding to the Walker B motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ATP hydrolysis—provides a clear mechanistic rationale that is essential for translational development (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Third, its favorable pharmacological properties, including oral bioavailability and a safety profile established in non-human primates, further underline its developmental feasibility (Kaur et al., 2025; ClinicalTrials.gov).  \n\nHowever, there are some potential weaknesses that must be carefully considered. Although rodent models have provided robust efficacy data, the translation of these effects to humans remains to be fully validated. There is a paucity of comprehensive clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with MCC950, which introduces uncertainty regarding its efficacy and potential off-target effects in a human patient population. Additionally, while the compound is highly selective for the NLRP3 inflammasome, it is critical to further elucidate its long-term safety and impact on global immune function, given the essential role of inflammasomes in host defense. In some experimental contexts, there has been variability in the inhibition of inflammation and fibrosis depending on the specific disease model, suggesting that its therapeutic window may differ based on disease etiology (Sabra et al., 2023). Despite these challenges, the overall evidence supports the further development of MCC950 as a mechanistic intervention in CKD, particularly in settings where inflammasome-driven pathology is predominant.\n\nIn summary, MCC950 is a well-characterized, rationally designed NLRP3 inhibitor with strong preclinical evidence demonstrating its renoprotective effects in various models of chronic kidney disease. Its specific binding to the Walker B motif of the NLRP3 NACHT domain and subsequent inhibition of ATP hydrolysis form the basis of its mechanism, reducing caspase-1 activation, IL-1β/IL-18 maturation, and gasdermin-D-mediated pyroptosis. These actions are expected to translate into reduced tubular epithelial cell death, diminished interstitial inflammation, and alleviation of fibrotic remodeling—key pathological processes in CKD progression. While further clinical validation is necessary, the strengths in mechanistic rationale, preclinical efficacy data, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties position MCC950 as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Coll et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022).\n\nReferences  \nColl, R.

"(VX-765, 5)","(Brilliant Blue G, 1)","Both candidates target inflammasome‐mediated inflammation and fibrosis in CKD but at different levels. Candidate 1, Brilliant Blue G (BBG), is a noncompetitive P2X7 antagonist with extensive rodent data (UUO, hypertensive nephropathy, lupus nephritis) showing reduced IL-1β, macrophage infiltration, pyroptosis, and fibrosis. BBG benefits from a known safety profile in surgical and CNS applications and water solubility. However, it lacks human pharmacokinetic and chronic‐dosing data in CKD, may have off‐target effects via pannexin-1 or vascular P2X7, and faces redundant inflammasome pathways limiting monotherapy efficacy. Candidate 2, VX-765 (Belnacasan), is an orally bioavailable prodrug converting to a selective irreversible caspase-1 inhibitor. Preclinical models of diabetic nephropathy and UUO show decreased IL-1β, pyroptosis, macrophage infiltration, and collagen deposition. VX-765 has advanced into Phase II trials for epilepsy and psoriasis, establishing human safety, tolerability, and target engagement. Its MoA is highly specific and structurally validated; oral administration and known ADME/PK strengthen feasibility. The main uncertainty is the lack of dedicated CKD clinical trials and potential compensatory inflammatory pathways over long‐term caspase-1 inhibition. Overall, VX-765 combines robust mechanistic clarity, translational PK/safety data, and relevant rodent efficacy, whereas BBG, despite promising preclinical data, lacks human repurposing evidence and faces specificity and pathway‐redundancy concerns.","VX-765 is superior due to its direct, highly specific caspase-1 inhibition with structural validation, oral bioavailability, established Phase II safety and human PK, and positive rodent CKD models. BBG, while promising in preclinical kidney injury studies, lacks human dosing and chronic safety data in CKD, has broader target interactions that could raise off-target risks, and may be limited by inflammasome pathway redundancy. VX-765’s clinical readiness and clearer translatability give it the highest probability of successful experimental outcome and eventual therapy viability in CKD.",34,"(1, 5)","{'hypothesis': 'Brilliant Blue G (BBG; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #B0770)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Brilliant Blue G (BBG; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #B0770)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nBrilliant Blue G (BBG) is a synthetic dye originally developed for use in food and as a surgical visualizing agent that has been repurposed as a pharmacological agent. BBG is part of the broad class of blue dyes that have been extensively studied for their ability to interact with the purinergic receptor family, most notably acting as a non‐competitive antagonist of the P2X7 receptor. The compound’s chemical structure confers high water solubility and the ability to be administered at defined doses with a favorable safety profile, as demonstrated by its routine use in ophthalmic surgery and CNS studies without systemic toxicity. In its role as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, BBG has been used in various preclinical studies investigating inflammatory and cell death pathways. Its synthetic origin and established manufacturing process, as offered by suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #B0770), support its scalability for repurposing in chronic diseases. BBG belongs to a class of small molecules that modulate ion channel function, particularly by binding to the ATP‐activated P2X7 receptor, which has been implicated in various inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. This class of compounds has been employed not only for their staining properties but also for their ability to interfere with cellular signaling events related to inflammation, rendering them of considerable interest in conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD) where inflammation and fibrosis are critical pathogenic factors (Ferreira et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nHistorically, Brilliant Blue G has been most widely recognized as a histological staining agent with established safety in both preclinical and clinical contexts, particularly within the neuroprotective field. Its pharmacological actions extend to antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, and preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in animal models of inflammatory diseases, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and various neurodegenerative conditions. More recently, BBG has been evaluated in rodent models of kidney disease. For example, in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) models—a widely used experimental model that mimics tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis—BBG treatment has been observed to reduce inflammation, diminish interstitial fibrosis, and promote tubular cell regeneration (Pereira et al., 2020). In rodent hypertensive nephropathy models, BBG has also been reported to modulate renal vascular resistance and alter tubular injury markers, suggesting that its renoprotective effects might extend to a broader spectrum of CKD–related pathologies. Although clinical trials directly targeting chronic kidney disease with BBG have not yet been detailed in the public literature, searches in ClinicalTrials.gov using terms related to “Brilliant Blue G OR P2X7 antagonist OR P2X7 inhibitor OR NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have identified several ongoing studies investigating similar P2X7 blockade strategies in CKD, which support the translational potential of this approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Prior investigations in animal models of lupus nephritis and hypertensive kidney disease have indicated that BBG’s anti‐inflammatory profile, including decreased IL-1β levels and reduced macrophage infiltration, is conducive to preventing progressive renal damage (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020). Veterinary and preclinical applications in models of inflammatory injury provide a solid foundation for repurposing BBG as a potential therapeutic candidate in conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, such as CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe mechanism by which BBG is hypothesized to exert its renoprotective effects in CKD is centered on its ability to non‐competitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor present on both renal immune and epithelial cells. The P2X7 receptor is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated cation channel that is activated under pathophysiological conditions where extracellular ATP levels are elevated, which frequently occurs during tissue injury and inflammation. Once activated, the P2X7 receptor facilitates the formation of pores in the plasma membrane that allow for the influx of cations and the efflux of cellular contents, thereby precipitating a cascade of intracellular events. One critical downstream consequence of P2X7 activation is the priming and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that, upon activation, recruits the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and pro-caspase-1. This assembly leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase-1, which in turn processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, resulting in their secretion and the amplification of the inflammatory response. Moreover, P2X7 activation can induce pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that further exacerbates tissue injury and inflammation (Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nBBG exerts its effects via a noncompetitive blockade of the P2X7 receptor. In doing so, BBG prevents ATP-induced ion channel opening, thereby blocking the subsequent calcium influx and pore formation that are necessary for downstream inflammasome priming. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that BBG inhibits P2X7 receptor-mediated responses, including the calcium influx and the release of IL-1β from macrophages and other immune cells. In vitro studies with BBG have revealed nanomolar potency in blocking P2X7-mediated activities, which is reflective of its efficacy in dampening the inflammasome-related cytokine cascades (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019). Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that BBG may also interfere with pannexin-1 channels that are thought to facilitate ATP release and further promote inflammasome activation, although the precise relationship between pannexin-1 and P2X7 remains the subject of active research (Ferreira et al., 2016). Consequently, by inhibiting the P2X7 receptor, BBG blocks the ATP-driven initiation of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade. This blockade limits caspase-1 activation and the subsequent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, ultimately reducing local inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrotic remodeling within the renal parenchyma. Evidence from animal models indicates that such inhibition leads to reduced macrophage infiltration, decreased fibrogenic markers, and enhanced tubular cell regeneration, which collectively preserve the integrity of the tubulointerstitial architecture (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the established mechanistic pathway, BBG is expected to exert multifaceted renoprotective effects when applied to models of chronic kidney disease. In the proposed assay evaluating drug effects on renal cells, the expected outcome would involve a significant reduction in ATP-induced inflammasome activation. Specifically, by antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, BBG should lower the levels of active caspase-1, thereby reducing the maturation and extracellular release of IL-1β. This attenuation of inflammasome activation is expected to diminish pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells and mitigate pro-inflammatory cytokine release from resident macrophages. BBG’s inhibition of these pathways would theoretically preserve tubular architecture and limit interstitial fibrosis—a hallmark of progressive CKD. The renoprotective effect is anticipated to be observed as decreased expression of fibrosis markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and heat shock protein-47 (HSP47), as well as reduced collagen deposition, as evidenced in rodent models of UUO and hypertensive nephropathy (Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nAt the molecular level, renal epithelial cells, particularly proximal tubular cells, express both P2X7 receptors and components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Immunohistochemical studies in animal models have demonstrated that under pathological conditions, P2X7 receptor expression is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells and can lead to enhanced production of IL-1β when activated by extracellular ATP (Arulkumaran, 2016; Howarth, 2020). Therefore, BBG is expected to be especially effective in cell types that are critical in the development of inflammation and fibrosis in CKD. By reducing the number of inflammatory cells (such as CD68-positive macrophages) infiltrating the renal parenchyma and by limiting cell death via pyroptosis, BBG may also indirectly reduce the fibrotic signaling that is mediated by cytokines such as TGF-β. This dual effect—both direct inhibition of inflammatory signaling and preservation of renal cell integrity—provides a compelling rationale for BBG’s use in preventing the progression of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nMoreover, BBG’s known safety profile in central nervous system studies and its extensive use as a surgical dye underscore its translational potential. Its water solubility and known pharmacokinetics facilitate dosing strategies that could be adapted for chronic administration in CKD patients. Additionally, the indirect suppression of inflammasome activation through P2X7 antagonism presents a novel approach to modulating the inflammatory microenvironment in the kidney, one that targets a critical nexus of inflammation and fibrosis (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, BBG presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on its ability to noncompetitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor, thereby blocking ATP-induced inflammasome priming and activation. The strengths of BBG include its well-established safety profile, water solubility, and proven efficacy in various rodent models of kidney injury such as hypertensive nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction. Preclinical data indicate that BBG can reduce key mediators of inflammation such as IL-1β, lower caspase-1 activation, and mitigate the deleterious effects of pyroptosis on renal tubular architecture, all of which are central to the pathophysiology of CKD (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain that warrant further investigation. There is limited direct clinical data specifically evaluating BBG in human CKD patients, although the identification of related clinical trials targeting P2X7 and NLRP3 receptors in CKD suggests active interest in this therapeutic approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while BBG’s mechanism of action is well supported by in vitro and animal studies, the potential for differential effects based on receptor splice variants and cell type specificity in renal tissue must be carefully delineated. For instance, recent studies indicate that variations in P2X7 receptor expression and function in the renal vasculature may impact not only inflammatory signaling but also vascular tone, which could influence overall renal perfusion and function (Howarth, 2020).\n\nMoreover, while BBG’s indirect inhibition of the inflammasome pathway via P2X7 antagonism is mechanistically attractive, redundancy in inflammasome activation pathways—such as those that are P2X7-independent—might limit the overall efficacy of BBG as a monotherapy. Some studies have demonstrated that even with effective P2X7 inhibition, alternative pathways may still sustain IL-1β release under inflammatory conditions (Arulkumaran, 2016; Prendecki et al., 2022). Therefore, combination therapies that target multiple nodes in the inflammasome network may ultimately be required to achieve robust clinical benefit.\n\nIn terms of drug development strategies, BBG benefits from its established manufacturing and dosing data, which accelerates early phase clinical trial design and regulatory considerations. In addition, BBG has been successfully used in non-renal contexts—including long-term treatments in models of graft-versus-host disease—without significant toxicity, lending further support to its translational potential (Geraghty et al., 2019). The extensive literature on BBG’s anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in preclinical models provides a solid rationale for advancing this candidate for CKD even as further mechanistic and pharmacodynamic studies are conducted.\n\nWeaknesses of this candidate include the fact that while much of the preclinical data is encouraging, there is still a need for robust clinical trials that specifically assess BBG in CKD. Additionally, given the complexity of CKD pathogenesis—which involves multiple overlapping inflammatory and fibrotic signaling mechanisms—it will be important to determine whether BBG alone can induce sufficient therapeutic benefit or whether it is best applied as part of a combination regimen. Moreover, the potential vascular effects of P2X7 antagonism require further clarification to ensure that systemic hemodynamics are not adversely affected, particularly in patients with existing cardiovascular complications that often accompany CKD (Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall, the mechanistic rationale for BBG centers on its ability to interfere with a critical inflammatory pathway—namely, the ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. This blockade not only reduces the activation of caspase-1 and the release of IL-1β but also limits pyroptotic cell death, preservation of tubular architecture, and ultimately, fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. These effects address key pathogenic mechanisms underlying CKD progression. Moreover, aspects such as its water solubility, known dosing regimens from CNS and surgical applications, and favorable preclinical safety record render BBG an attractive candidate for fast-tracked repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Ferreira et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence reviewed indicates that Brilliant Blue G holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. Its mechanism—centered on noncompetitive antagonism of the P2X7 receptor and consequent suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade—offers a novel approach to preserving renal function by reducing inflammatory injury and fibrosis. While further research, particularly targeted clinical trials in the CKD patient population, is necessary to fully validate its efficacy and safety in this context, the preclinical data and extensive understanding of its molecular interactions support the continued development of BBG for CKD therapy (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nReferences  \nArulkumaran, N.

It belongs to the class of caspase-1 inhibitors, which are designed to target the proteolytic enzyme caspase‐1 responsible for the post-translational processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Originally discovered through efforts to identify small molecules that could modulate inflammasome-mediated inflammation, VX-765 was synthesized to covalently interact with the catalytic cysteine residue of caspase‐1 and thereby block its activity. This group of compounds is part of a broader category of anti-inflammatory agents that have been applied in conditions where excessive inflammasome activation leads to tissue damage, and they have been used in clinical studies for disorders such as epilepsy and psoriasis, demonstrating that this drug class can effectively modulate immune signaling pathways and cytokine maturation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nVX-765 has an established history in preclinical and early clinical research. It has advanced into Phase II trials in both epilepsy and psoriasis, conditions associated with chronic inflammation and abnormal cytokine signaling, thereby establishing a safety profile and demonstrating adequate target engagement in humans. Although it has not been widely evaluated in clinical trials specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), preclinical studies conducted in rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) have demonstrated that VX-765 effectively reduces markers of inflammation such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), diminishes macrophage infiltration, and reduces collagen deposition, which are indicative of reduced fibrotic remodeling in the kidney (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024). Additionally, the general class of caspase-1 inhibitors has been successfully applied in various inflammatory conditions, and mechanistic studies suggest that inhibiting caspase-1 can interrupt the cascade leading to pyroptotic cell death—a key factor in inflammatory tissue damage. Although there is no large-scale clinical trial data in CKD to date, the compound’s mechanism, coupled with existing human safety data from other indications, strongly supports its rapid repurposing potential for kidney diseases (Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nVX-765’s mechanism of action is centered on the selective inhibition of caspase-1, an essential enzyme involved in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, and in mediating a form of programmed cell death known as pyroptosis. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that VX-765 is a prodrug that is metabolized into VRT-043198, which binds irreversibly to the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys285) in the active site of caspase-1 through covalent interactions. Structural analyses, including crystallography experiments, have elucidated that VRT-043198 makes additional hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with key residues (e.g., R179, Q283, P343, and R383) ensuring a high degree of selectivity for inflammatory caspases over apoptotic caspases (Yang, 2019). By blocking caspase-1, VX-765 prevents the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active cytokine forms, thereby reducing the release of these potent inflammatory mediators; it also prevents the cleavage of gasdermin D, a critical effector protein required to form membrane pores that mediate pyroptotic cell death. In renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and other cell types implicated in kidney disease, such proclivity for pyroptosis can drive local inflammatory cascades and fibrotic signaling, so inhibiting caspase-1 may mitigate these processes (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). The specificity of VX-765 for caspase-1 has been confirmed through both in vitro assays—with assessments of IL-1β release and gasdermin D cleavage—and in vivo models where administration of VX-765 led to reduced serum IL-1β, improved survival in sepsis models, and attenuation of inflammatory tissue injury (Yang, 2019; Liu et al., 2023).\n\nExpected Effect in Chronic Kidney Disease:  \nIn the context of Chronic Kidney Disease, particularly conditions characterized by diabetic nephropathy and renal fibrosis, the hypothesis is that VX-765 will reduce caspase-1 mediated pyroptosis and subsequent inflammatory cytokine release in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). TEC pyroptosis contributes to tubular cell death and triggers a deleterious inflammatory milieu that ultimately drives fibrotic remodeling through the activation of myofibroblasts and increased deposition of extracellular matrix components such as collagen. VX-765 is expected to block this cascade at an early step by preventing the activation of caspase-1, thereby limiting IL-1β and IL-18 maturation and secretion. This, in turn, should reduce the recruitment and activation of inflammatory macrophages—a process that has been shown to contribute to fibrogenesis in the kidney (Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Preclinical evidence from rodent models supports that administration of VX-765 leads to decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced expression of pro-fibrotic markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and a lower deposition of collagen, thereby preserving renal tubular structure and function. Considering caspase-1 and the inflammasome complex are expressed in renal cells including TECs and resident macrophages, targeting caspase-1 is a rational approach to interrupt the feedback loop between cell death and inflammation that exacerbates CKD progression (Zhou & Li, 2023; Sanz et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of VX-765 as a therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease include its well-defined mechanism of action, oral bioavailability, and the fact that it has already undergone Phase II clinical trials in other indications, demonstrating an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in humans. The mechanistic rationale is strong: by targeting caspase-1, VX-765 interrupts the inflammasome-driven cascade responsible for both pyroptotic cell death and the maturation of key pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in renal fibrosis. Preclinical models of diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction have provided promising evidence that caspase-1 inhibition can reduce renal inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and extracellular matrix deposition, suggesting that VX-765 might slow the progression of fibrotic changes in CKD (Liu et al., 2023; Zhou & Li, 2023). Furthermore, targeting a central mediator such as caspase-1 may have broader benefits by influencing several downstream inflammatory pathways simultaneously, thus potentially overcoming the limitations of therapies that target individual cytokines.  \nWeaknesses include the translational gap that currently exists between preclinical efficacy in rodent models and clinical benefit in human CKD patients. Although VX-765 has demonstrated safety in epilepsy and psoriasis trials, the long-term effects of inhibiting caspase-1 in a chronic disease setting like CKD are not fully understood, particularly given the complex roles that inflammasome signaling may play in tissue repair, host defense, and kidney homeostasis. There is also the possibility that fully inhibiting caspase-1 could lead to compensatory activation of alternative inflammatory pathways or unintended off-target effects, especially in patients with compromised kidney function. Additionally, while preclinical data are encouraging, there is a need for dedicated clinical trials in CKD and related fibrotic conditions to establish the optimal dosing, efficacy, and safety profile in this specific patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yang, 2019).  \nOverall, VX-765 exhibits several promising attributes as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for CKD: its defined molecular target, demonstrated anti-inflammatory mechanism through caspase-1 inhibition, and supportive preclinical evidence of renoprotection provide a compelling rationale for further investigation. The strengths of existing human safety data and oral administration combine with a robust mechanistic framework to justify advancing VX-765 into clinical trials in patients with CKD. Nonetheless, further research is required to clarify long-term effects on renal function, potential compensatory inflammatory mechanisms, and the detailed pharmacodynamics in the setting of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. With carefully designed clinical studies focusing on renal endpoints, VX-765 could represent a valuable addition to the therapeutic arsenal against CKD, particularly for patients whose disease is driven significantly by inflammasome-mediated inflammation and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Islamuddin & Qin, 2024; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

"(A-438079, 2)","(INF4E, 4)","Candidate 1 (A-438079) benefits from extensive preclinical data showing efficacy in rodent models of acute renal injury (cisplatin nephrotoxicity, ischemia-reperfusion, sepsis) and direct relevance of the P2X7/NLRP3 axis to CKD pathogenesis. Its mechanism—high-affinity, selective antagonism of P2X7—interrupts an upstream step in inflammasome activation in renal macrophages and tubular cells. The safety profile is bolstered by minimal off-target activity in published studies, established bioavailability, and a well-characterized dose–response in vivo. Although long-term CKD models are still needed, the weight of evidence supports plausibility, specificity, and translational potential. Candidate 2 (INF4E) targets NLRP3 directly via covalent modification, offering potent and irreversible inhibition, but lacks any kidney-specific preclinical efficacy data. The irreversible, electrophilic mechanism raises safety and off-target toxicity concerns, especially in vulnerable renal cells, and clinical translation of NLRP3 inhibitors in CKD remains nascent. Thus, while scientifically novel, INF4E’s evidence base is weaker in the CKD context and carries higher risk.","A-438079 outperforms INF4E on multiple high-priority criteria: it has stronger, directly relevant preclinical evidence in renal injury models, a clearly defined and disease-central mechanism of action, and a more favorable safety and deliverability profile. INF4E, despite its targeted NLRP3 inhibition, lacks kidney-specific efficacy data, has higher potential toxicity due to its covalent chemistry, and has no established clinical or advanced preclinical CKD studies. Therefore, A-438079 is the superior candidate for CKD translation.",35,"(2, 4)","{'hypothesis': 'A-438079 (Tocris, catalog #2947)', 'answer': 'Proposal for A-438079 (Tocris, catalog #2947)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nA-438079 is a synthetic small‐molecule antagonist originally developed as a selective inhibitor of the P2X7 receptor, a ligand‐gated ion channel known to be activated by high concentrations of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The compound belongs to a class of agents that includes disubstituted tetrazoles and cyanoguanidine derivatives, which have been characterized by their ability to selectively block P2X7 receptor activation without significantly affecting other P2X subtypes. Its design and synthesis were initially achieved by pharmaceutical research groups (notably Abbott Laboratories as indicated in early publications) and have since been commercialized by companies such as Tocris (catalog #2947). This class of compounds was originally optimized for studies in inflammatory processes and pain models, as they inhibit ATP‐induced ion flux such as calcium influx and potassium efflux, a key factor in the activation cascade of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nBiochemically and pharmacologically, A-438079 has been investigated in various preclinical models for its ability to mitigate inflammation. It has demonstrated efficacy in rodent models of neuropathic pain and inflammatory conditions by inhibiting P2X7-mediated IL-1β release. In terms of renal applications, there is evidence from several studies that selective P2X7 antagonism can protect against kidney insults such as ischemia-reperfusion injury and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. For example, Zhang et al. (2014) showed that blocking P2X7 with antagonists like A-438079 attenuated cisplatin-induced renal tubular damage by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis markers in mice (Zhang et al., 2014). Additionally, studies such as those by Arulkumaran (2016) and colleagues have demonstrated that while genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of P2X7 in some models does not always equate to improved renal function, the block of P2X7-related signaling reduces inflammasome activation and cytokine release in immune cells and tubular epithelium (Arulkumaran, 2016; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Even though A-438079 has not been widely tested clinically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), its pharmacological profile as a P2X7 antagonist has been well characterized in biochemical studies and preclinical kidney injury models. This builds an indirect but strong rationale for repurposing it in CKD contexts, where sustained inflammation and fibrosis are major pathogenic drivers (Birch et al., 2013; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe primary mechanism of A-438079 is its high-affinity, selective antagonism of the P2X7 receptor. The P2X7 receptor is unique among the P2X family in its requirement for high concentrations of ATP, which are typically achieved in pathological conditions involving cell injury and inflammation. Under normal conditions, extracellular ATP levels are low; however, during tissue damage, ATP is released into the extracellular space where it binds to and activates P2X7 receptors expressed on immune cells (especially macrophages) and renal tubular epithelial cells (Han et al., 2020; Howarth, 2020).  \n\nUpon binding of ATP to the receptor, P2X7 undergoes a conformational change that opens its ion channel, permitting the influx of calcium ions and the efflux of potassium ions. This potassium efflux is a critical upstream event that triggers the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex responsible for activating caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 then cleaves the precursors of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature, secreted forms. These cytokines play major roles in propagating inflammatory signals, inducing pyroptosis (a form of inflammatory cell death), and promoting fibrotic remodeling in affected tissues (Qian et al., 2021; Shokoples, 2022).\n\nA-438079 interacts with the P2X7 receptor by competitively inhibiting ATP binding, thereby preventing the channel’s conformational change and subsequent ion flux. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) is approximately 40 nM in rodent models, indicating high potency (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). By blocking this pathway, A-438079 inhibits downstream events including NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 cleavage, and the release of IL-1β, ultimately reducing inflammatory responses and preventing the activation of fibrotic signaling pathways in kidney tissue, particularly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells where P2X7 and NLRP3 are highly expressed (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the context of chronic kidney disease, the principal pathological mechanisms include persistent inflammation and fibrosis, processes that are significantly driven by inflammasome activation in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. The hypothesis postulates that A-438079 will block ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor in these cell types. By doing so, it prevents the crucial potassium efflux that is necessary for the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The expected downstream effects include a reduction in caspase-1 activation, decreased cleavage of pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β, and ultimately lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This chain of events is anticipated to reduce pyroptosis and curb the progression of fibrosis within the kidney (Qian et al., 2021; Arulkumaran et al., 2018).\n\nRenal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells are known to express both the P2X7 receptor and NLRP3, as evidenced by various studies outlining their roles in mediating inflammation-driven fibrosis in CKD (Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020). In assays, it is expected that treatment with A-438079 would result in a measurable decrease in IL-1β release, reduced markers of inflammation such as caspase-1 activity, and potentially lower expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components. Furthermore, by blunting chronic inflammatory responses, A-438079 may help to preserve kidney structure and function, thereby slowing the progression of CKD. The compound’s favorable pharmacokinetic properties—particularly its demonstrated bioavailability and minimal off-target effects—support the feasibility of achieving these outcomes (Burnstock, 2017).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nA-438079 presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on several factors. One of its major strengths lies in its selectivity and potency as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, which allows it to precisely target an upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that is centrally implicated in CKD. The ability of A-438079 to block ATP-induced ion flux is particularly compelling because it interrupts the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a known driver of IL-1β and IL-18 release in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells (Arulkumaran, 2016; Qian et al., 2021). This molecular specificity holds promise for reducing inflammation and subsequent fibrotic formation in the kidney, both of which are critical elements in CKD progression.\n\nThe preclinical evidence supporting the use of P2X7 antagonists in models of acute kidney injury, such as cisplatin nephrotoxicity and sepsis-induced renal injury, provides additional rationale, even though such models are not perfect surrogates for CKD (Zhang et al., 2014; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Some studies have demonstrated that selective P2X7 blockade can attenuate inflammatory cytokine production, improve renal function markers, and reduce cell death, thereby supporting the hypothesis that similar benefits could be realized in chronic inflammatory settings like CKD (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nAdditionally, the mechanistic details of P2X7 receptor signaling – requiring high extracellular ATP concentrations, initiating K+ efflux, and triggering inflammasome assembly – align closely with the known processes of renal inflammation and fibrosis. The fact that P2X7 and NLRP3 are co-expressed in key renal cell populations reinforces the logic behind using A-438079 to target these pathways (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and potential challenges that need to be considered. Firstly, in some preclinical models, especially in certain rat strains (as noted by studies involving P2X7 receptor knockout rats), the inhibition or deletion of P2X7 did not significantly alter renal function or prevent kidney injury induced by hypertensive factors such as angiotensin II (Nespoux et al., 2024). This suggests that compensatory pathways may exist, and the role of P2X7 might be context-dependent or vary among species. Secondly, clinical trials of P2X7 antagonists in other inflammatory diseases have had mixed outcomes, raising concerns about translational efficacy in human CKD (Luz et al., 2019). Moreover, while the mechanism of inflammasome inhibition is well understood in vitro, the in vivo pharmacodynamics in the kidney may be complicated by variable local ATP concentrations and the dynamic expression of the receptor in disease states.\n\nFrom a drug development standpoint, the potency (IC50 ~40 nM) and reported good bioavailability of A-438079 are advantageous. Its minimal off-target effects also reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions in clinical translation. However, more robust and specific data in CKD models are necessary to establish whether the attenuation of IL-1β release can consistently translate into meaningful improvements in renal fibrosis and overall kidney function over long-term treatment courses (Chen et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2024).\n\nIn summary, A-438079’s targeted inhibition of the P2X7 receptor offers a novel approach to halt the ATP-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby mitigating a key upstream trigger of inflammatory cascades in CKD. Its preclinical track record in inflammatory and renal injury models, combined with its mechanistic specificity, positions it as a strong candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease. Nonetheless, species variability, redundant inflammatory pathways, and the need for further in vivo validation in models of long-term kidney disease remain potential hurdles. If these challenges are addressed in further preclinical and early clinical studies, A-438079 could represent a significant advance in targeting the inflammation-fibrosis axis in CKD (Arulkumaran et al., 2018; Fantauzzi, 2013; Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe strengths of A-438079 for CKD include its high potency, selectivity, and well-elucidated mechanism of action in blocking ATP-induced P2X7 receptor activation—a critical initiator of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. These molecular interactions have been robustly characterized in multiple preclinical studies, indicating that the drug may effectively reduce IL-1β-mediated inflammation and subsequent fibrotic responses. In models of acute renal injury, antagonizing P2X7 has led to reduced cell death and improved renal function, which supports its potential usage in CKD where chronic inflammation is a driver of progressive fibrosis. Moreover, the chemical class to which A-438079 belongs has been extensively employed in studies of inflammatory diseases, reinforcing the feasibility of this approach (Deplano, 2012; Qian et al., 2021).\n\nConversely, potential weaknesses lie in the heterogeneity of experimental outcomes across different preclinical models and species. Some studies have shown that genetic deletion of P2X7 in rats does not always confer renal protection in induced kidney injury, suggesting that the pathophysiology in certain species—or even specific CKD etiologies—may be driven by redundant pathways beyond P2X7/NLRP3. In addition, although A-438079 demonstrates promising in vitro efficacy, there remains a critical need for long-term in vivo studies specifically in CKD models to verify that its anti-inflammatory effects translate into clinically meaningful outcomes in terms of preservation of renal function and reduction in fibrosis. Lastly, it is important to consider potential compensatory mechanisms in chronic inflammation that may limit the sole efficacy of P2X7 inhibition (Nespoux et al., 2024; Luz et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, A-438079 is a scientifically compelling therapeutic candidate for CKD, with robust mechanistic support and significant preclinical evidence in inflammatory models. Its ability to target the P2X7/NLRP3 axis addresses a novel therapeutic area in CKD by potentially halting the progression of inflammation-driven fibrosis. However, potential limitations due to species-specific responses and redundancy in inflammatory signaling must be carefully evaluated in future studies. Overall, A-438079 merits further investigation as part of a multi-pronged approach to modulate inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in chronic kidney disease (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:  \nArulkumaran, N.

It is an acrylate derivative belonging to a class of compounds that harness α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl (Michael acceptor) functionalities to achieve covalent, irreversible inhibition of target proteins. Its discovery emerged during screening campaigns that looked for submicromolar potency against NLRP3, with subsequent chemical optimization to balance reactivity and cytotoxicity. Specifically, INF4E (also referred to in some studies as compound 9) was identified for its ability to selectively inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation by binding covalently to the NACHT domain’s ATP‐binding site, thereby interfering with ATP hydrolysis required for the conformational changes that lead to inflammasome assembly (Cocco et al., 2017; Blevins et al., 2022). As a member of the acrylate derivatives class, similar compounds have been explored in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular disorders, where targeting NLRP3 has shown promise. Members of this chemical class have a well‐documented history of being used as selective covalent modifiers with potential in modulating inflammatory signaling cascades.  \n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of INF4E and its related chemical family primarily stems from preclinical studies where they have been shown to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in various models of inflammation. INF4E was originally validated in sepsis models, demonstrating efficacy in reducing systemic inflammation, and subsequent studies extended its utility to show anti‐pyroptotic effects in macrophage cell lines with submicromolar potency. Moreover, related acrylate derivatives have been explored in inflammatory bowel disease models, where modifications to reduce cytotoxicity led to the generation of analogues such as INF39. Although the preclinical literature for this class of inhibitors is robust in the context of sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, and even in models of ischemic injury in the heart, there is no direct literature evidence that INF4E has been specifically used for treating chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis. Searches in Clinical Trials databases for “NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have revealed only nascent clinical exploration of NLRP3 inhibitors in renal disease, with most candidates like MCC950 and OLT1177 being at early development stages (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023). Thus, while INF4E’s mechanism of NLRP3 inhibition is highly relevant to inflammatory processes, its therapeutic history in kidney disease remains limited to preclinical mechanistic rationale rather than established clinical or veterinary use in CKD.  \n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, INF4E exerts its action by covalently binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, specifically targeting its ATP‐binding site. The NACHT domain is essential for NLRP3 oligomerization and subsequent inflammasome assembly. INF4E’s acrylate (Michael acceptor) moiety reacts with cysteine residues present in this domain, thereby irreversibly blocking ATP hydrolysis. The inhibition of ATP hydrolysis interferes directly with the required conformational changes that transform NLRP3 from an inactive to an active state capable of recruiting the adaptor protein ASC and procaspase‐1. Consequently, the subsequent cleavage of caspase‐1 is prevented, which in turn stops the maturation and release of key pro‐inflammatory cytokines, notably IL‐1β and IL‐18 (Mezzaroma et al., 2021; Cocco et al., 2017).  \nThis covalent binding mechanism is particularly significant because it offers prolonged inhibitory effects owing to its irreversible nature. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, where hypoxia serves as a potent priming signal for inflammasome activation and contributes to chronic inflammation and fibrosis, inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E is hypothesized to prevent the cascade leading to caspase‐1 activation, thus mitigating caspase‐1–dependent pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death—and reducing the release of IL‐18 (Blevins et al., 2022; Komada & Muruve, 2019).  \nThe biochemical interactions of INF4E align with the known structure–activity relationships of electrophilic acrylate derivatives, as these compounds are designed to target the ATPase activity of NLRP3. By interfering with this enzymatic function, INF4E halts the nucleation of the inflammasome complex, thereby curtailing downstream signaling that ultimately leads to pyroptosis and fibrogenesis. The short-lived yet potent irreversible binding is a hallmark of this class of inhibitors, which has been exploited in several preclinical studies to provide a potent blockade of inflammation (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the context of the proposed assay and the underlying pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease, INF4E is anticipated to exhibit a therapeutic effect by mitigating hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation in proximal tubular epithelial cells. Hypoxic conditions are known to prime and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in these cells, and this process is a major contributor to tubular cell injury, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenic signaling—all key drivers of CKD progression.  \nThe expected outcome when applying INF4E would be a significant reduction in ATP hydrolysis that is crucial for NLRP3 activation, thereby preventing the subsequent assembly of the inflammasome complex. This inhibition should lead to a decrease in caspase‐1 activity, ultimately lowering the maturation and secretion of IL‐18 (and possibly IL‐1β). Reduced levels of IL‐18 would then limit the inflammatory and fibrogenic signaling cascades that promote the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis. In assays using hypoxic proximal tubular cells, one would therefore predict reduced markers of pyroptosis, improved cell viability, and a lower expression of fibrogenic proteins such as TGF-β and α-SMA.  \nThere is also supportive evidence that NLRP3 is expressed in proximal tubular cells and that its activation is directly linked to inflammatory responses and fibrosis under hypoxic conditions (Ochoa et al., 2023; Komada & Muruve, 2019). The selective inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E should thus translate into improved cellular integrity and a mitigated progression of the inflammatory milieu that typifies CKD. This expected modulation of pyroptosis and fibrosis markers provides a clear biochemical rationale for using INF4E as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic therapeutic candidate in kidney disease models.  \n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe analysis of INF4E as a repurposed drug candidate for chronic kidney disease presents both promising and challenging aspects. One major strength of INF4E lies in its clearly defined mechanism of action; by targeting the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and interfering with ATP hydrolysis, INF4E offers a direct method to abrogate inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. This is particularly relevant in CKD, where hypoxia-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in proximal tubular cells is a key pathological event leading to pyroptosis, inflammation, and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019).  \nAnother strength is its proven submicromolar potency as demonstrated in phenotypic screens, along with a degree of oral bioavailability in rodent models that supports the feasibility of future in vivo investigations (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021). This potency, combined with its specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome, positions INF4E as a candidate with the potential to modulate inflammatory responses without broadly suppressing the entire immune system. Moreover, by specifically reducing IL-18 release, INF4E may offer advantages over broader anti-inflammatory approaches that risk impairing normal host defense mechanisms (Thomas et al., 2022).  \nA potential weakness, however, is the risk associated with irreversible covalent binding, which, while conferring prolonged effects, may also lead to off-target toxicity if the selectivity is not absolute. Some acrylate derivatives have been noted for cytotoxicity issues, and although chemical optimization—such as the development of related compounds like INF39—has been undertaken to alleviate these concerns, it remains a critical point for evaluation in renal cells that are already susceptible to injury under hypoxic conditions (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \nFurthermore, while the mechanistic rationale for targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in CKD is strong, the clinical translation of NLRP3 inhibitors has been slow. Currently, only limited clinical trial data are available for NLRP3 inhibitors in CKD, and the majority of evidence remains at the preclinical level (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023).  \nAnother consideration is that chronic kidney disease is a multifactorial condition wherein inflammasome activation is just one of several pathogenic processes, including metabolic dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and oxidative stress. Therefore, while INF4E may effectively block one critical pathway—namely, hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation—it might need to be combined with therapies targeting other aspects of CKD pathogenesis to achieve a comprehensive therapeutic effect (Unknown Reference; Mulay, 2019).  \nDespite these challenges, INF4E’s selectivity for a mechanistically validated target, its oral availability, and its demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory models provide a strong rationale for further investigation. In assays designed to model hypoxic tubular injury, INF4E is expected to reduce pyroptosis and fibrogenic signaling, thereby slowing CKD progression. The drug’s success in other inflammatory contexts, such as sepsis models, lends additional weight to its potential, although caution must be exercised when extrapolating these data to the complex microenvironment of the kidney (Blevins et al., 2022; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \n\nContinued research should focus on dosing optimization, safety profiling in kidney-specific models, and investigation of combination strategies that target both inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in CKD (Komada & Muruve, 2019; Mulay, 2019; Pagliaro & Penna, 2023; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nOverall, INF4E represents a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for chronic kidney disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, which aligns well with an established pathogenic pathway in CKD—namely, hypoxia-driven NLRP3 inflammasome activation in proximal tubular cells. Its ability to block the ATPase activity of NLRP3, thereby preventing both caspase-1 activation and IL-18 release, underpins a novel strategy aimed at mitigating pyroptosis and subsequent fibrogenic signaling cascades. While challenges such as potential off-target cytotoxicity, the need for extensive in vivo validation in CKD models, and integration into a multifactorial therapeutic approach remain, the compelling preclinical data for related compounds and the rigorous mechanistic underpinnings provide a strong basis for advancing INF4E in further preclinical studies and eventual clinical trials. Continued research should include detailed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological evaluations in renal models, as well as assessments of its efficacy in reducing markers of inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrosis in hypoxic proximal tubular cells. Given the complexity of CKD, INF4E may ultimately be best suited for combination therapy alongside agents addressing complementary pathogenic mechanisms. Overall, the potential strengths of INF4E—rooted in its selective, irreversible inhibition of a well‐validated molecular target—are balanced by the need for careful evaluation of safety and clinical translatability in the setting of chronic kidney disease (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nReferences:  \nBlevins, H.

BBG is part of the broad class of blue dyes that have been extensively studied for their ability to interact with the purinergic receptor family, most notably acting as a non‐competitive antagonist of the P2X7 receptor. The compound’s chemical structure confers high water solubility and the ability to be administered at defined doses with a favorable safety profile, as demonstrated by its routine use in ophthalmic surgery and CNS studies without systemic toxicity. In its role as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, BBG has been used in various preclinical studies investigating inflammatory and cell death pathways. Its synthetic origin and established manufacturing process, as offered by suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #B0770), support its scalability for repurposing in chronic diseases. BBG belongs to a class of small molecules that modulate ion channel function, particularly by binding to the ATP‐activated P2X7 receptor, which has been implicated in various inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. This class of compounds has been employed not only for their staining properties but also for their ability to interfere with cellular signaling events related to inflammation, rendering them of considerable interest in conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD) where inflammation and fibrosis are critical pathogenic factors (Ferreira et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nHistorically, Brilliant Blue G has been most widely recognized as a histological staining agent with established safety in both preclinical and clinical contexts, particularly within the neuroprotective field. Its pharmacological actions extend to antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, and preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in animal models of inflammatory diseases, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and various neurodegenerative conditions. More recently, BBG has been evaluated in rodent models of kidney disease. For example, in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) models—a widely used experimental model that mimics tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis—BBG treatment has been observed to reduce inflammation, diminish interstitial fibrosis, and promote tubular cell regeneration (Pereira et al., 2020). In rodent hypertensive nephropathy models, BBG has also been reported to modulate renal vascular resistance and alter tubular injury markers, suggesting that its renoprotective effects might extend to a broader spectrum of CKD–related pathologies. Although clinical trials directly targeting chronic kidney disease with BBG have not yet been detailed in the public literature, searches in ClinicalTrials.gov using terms related to “Brilliant Blue G OR P2X7 antagonist OR P2X7 inhibitor OR NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have identified several ongoing studies investigating similar P2X7 blockade strategies in CKD, which support the translational potential of this approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Prior investigations in animal models of lupus nephritis and hypertensive kidney disease have indicated that BBG’s anti‐inflammatory profile, including decreased IL-1β levels and reduced macrophage infiltration, is conducive to preventing progressive renal damage (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020). Veterinary and preclinical applications in models of inflammatory injury provide a solid foundation for repurposing BBG as a potential therapeutic candidate in conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, such as CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe mechanism by which BBG is hypothesized to exert its renoprotective effects in CKD is centered on its ability to non‐competitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor present on both renal immune and epithelial cells. The P2X7 receptor is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated cation channel that is activated under pathophysiological conditions where extracellular ATP levels are elevated, which frequently occurs during tissue injury and inflammation. Once activated, the P2X7 receptor facilitates the formation of pores in the plasma membrane that allow for the influx of cations and the efflux of cellular contents, thereby precipitating a cascade of intracellular events. One critical downstream consequence of P2X7 activation is the priming and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that, upon activation, recruits the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and pro-caspase-1. This assembly leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase-1, which in turn processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, resulting in their secretion and the amplification of the inflammatory response. Moreover, P2X7 activation can induce pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that further exacerbates tissue injury and inflammation (Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nBBG exerts its effects via a noncompetitive blockade of the P2X7 receptor. In doing so, BBG prevents ATP-induced ion channel opening, thereby blocking the subsequent calcium influx and pore formation that are necessary for downstream inflammasome priming. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that BBG inhibits P2X7 receptor-mediated responses, including the calcium influx and the release of IL-1β from macrophages and other immune cells. In vitro studies with BBG have revealed nanomolar potency in blocking P2X7-mediated activities, which is reflective of its efficacy in dampening the inflammasome-related cytokine cascades (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019). Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that BBG may also interfere with pannexin-1 channels that are thought to facilitate ATP release and further promote inflammasome activation, although the precise relationship between pannexin-1 and P2X7 remains the subject of active research (Ferreira et al., 2016). Consequently, by inhibiting the P2X7 receptor, BBG blocks the ATP-driven initiation of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade. This blockade limits caspase-1 activation and the subsequent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, ultimately reducing local inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrotic remodeling within the renal parenchyma. Evidence from animal models indicates that such inhibition leads to reduced macrophage infiltration, decreased fibrogenic markers, and enhanced tubular cell regeneration, which collectively preserve the integrity of the tubulointerstitial architecture (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the established mechanistic pathway, BBG is expected to exert multifaceted renoprotective effects when applied to models of chronic kidney disease. In the proposed assay evaluating drug effects on renal cells, the expected outcome would involve a significant reduction in ATP-induced inflammasome activation. Specifically, by antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, BBG should lower the levels of active caspase-1, thereby reducing the maturation and extracellular release of IL-1β. This attenuation of inflammasome activation is expected to diminish pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells and mitigate pro-inflammatory cytokine release from resident macrophages. BBG’s inhibition of these pathways would theoretically preserve tubular architecture and limit interstitial fibrosis—a hallmark of progressive CKD. The renoprotective effect is anticipated to be observed as decreased expression of fibrosis markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and heat shock protein-47 (HSP47), as well as reduced collagen deposition, as evidenced in rodent models of UUO and hypertensive nephropathy (Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nAt the molecular level, renal epithelial cells, particularly proximal tubular cells, express both P2X7 receptors and components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Immunohistochemical studies in animal models have demonstrated that under pathological conditions, P2X7 receptor expression is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells and can lead to enhanced production of IL-1β when activated by extracellular ATP (Arulkumaran, 2016; Howarth, 2020). Therefore, BBG is expected to be especially effective in cell types that are critical in the development of inflammation and fibrosis in CKD. By reducing the number of inflammatory cells (such as CD68-positive macrophages) infiltrating the renal parenchyma and by limiting cell death via pyroptosis, BBG may also indirectly reduce the fibrotic signaling that is mediated by cytokines such as TGF-β. This dual effect—both direct inhibition of inflammatory signaling and preservation of renal cell integrity—provides a compelling rationale for BBG’s use in preventing the progression of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nMoreover, BBG’s known safety profile in central nervous system studies and its extensive use as a surgical dye underscore its translational potential. Its water solubility and known pharmacokinetics facilitate dosing strategies that could be adapted for chronic administration in CKD patients. Additionally, the indirect suppression of inflammasome activation through P2X7 antagonism presents a novel approach to modulating the inflammatory microenvironment in the kidney, one that targets a critical nexus of inflammation and fibrosis (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, BBG presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on its ability to noncompetitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor, thereby blocking ATP-induced inflammasome priming and activation. The strengths of BBG include its well-established safety profile, water solubility, and proven efficacy in various rodent models of kidney injury such as hypertensive nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction. Preclinical data indicate that BBG can reduce key mediators of inflammation such as IL-1β, lower caspase-1 activation, and mitigate the deleterious effects of pyroptosis on renal tubular architecture, all of which are central to the pathophysiology of CKD (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain that warrant further investigation. There is limited direct clinical data specifically evaluating BBG in human CKD patients, although the identification of related clinical trials targeting P2X7 and NLRP3 receptors in CKD suggests active interest in this therapeutic approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while BBG’s mechanism of action is well supported by in vitro and animal studies, the potential for differential effects based on receptor splice variants and cell type specificity in renal tissue must be carefully delineated. For instance, recent studies indicate that variations in P2X7 receptor expression and function in the renal vasculature may impact not only inflammatory signaling but also vascular tone, which could influence overall renal perfusion and function (Howarth, 2020).\n\nMoreover, while BBG’s indirect inhibition of the inflammasome pathway via P2X7 antagonism is mechanistically attractive, redundancy in inflammasome activation pathways—such as those that are P2X7-independent—might limit the overall efficacy of BBG as a monotherapy. Some studies have demonstrated that even with effective P2X7 inhibition, alternative pathways may still sustain IL-1β release under inflammatory conditions (Arulkumaran, 2016; Prendecki et al., 2022). Therefore, combination therapies that target multiple nodes in the inflammasome network may ultimately be required to achieve robust clinical benefit.\n\nIn terms of drug development strategies, BBG benefits from its established manufacturing and dosing data, which accelerates early phase clinical trial design and regulatory considerations. In addition, BBG has been successfully used in non-renal contexts—including long-term treatments in models of graft-versus-host disease—without significant toxicity, lending further support to its translational potential (Geraghty et al., 2019). The extensive literature on BBG’s anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in preclinical models provides a solid rationale for advancing this candidate for CKD even as further mechanistic and pharmacodynamic studies are conducted.\n\nWeaknesses of this candidate include the fact that while much of the preclinical data is encouraging, there is still a need for robust clinical trials that specifically assess BBG in CKD. Additionally, given the complexity of CKD pathogenesis—which involves multiple overlapping inflammatory and fibrotic signaling mechanisms—it will be important to determine whether BBG alone can induce sufficient therapeutic benefit or whether it is best applied as part of a combination regimen. Moreover, the potential vascular effects of P2X7 antagonism require further clarification to ensure that systemic hemodynamics are not adversely affected, particularly in patients with existing cardiovascular complications that often accompany CKD (Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall, the mechanistic rationale for BBG centers on its ability to interfere with a critical inflammatory pathway—namely, the ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. This blockade not only reduces the activation of caspase-1 and the release of IL-1β but also limits pyroptotic cell death, preservation of tubular architecture, and ultimately, fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. These effects address key pathogenic mechanisms underlying CKD progression. Moreover, aspects such as its water solubility, known dosing regimens from CNS and surgical applications, and favorable preclinical safety record render BBG an attractive candidate for fast-tracked repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Ferreira et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence reviewed indicates that Brilliant Blue G holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. Its mechanism—centered on noncompetitive antagonism of the P2X7 receptor and consequent suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade—offers a novel approach to preserving renal function by reducing inflammatory injury and fibrosis. While further research, particularly targeted clinical trials in the CKD patient population, is necessary to fully validate its efficacy and safety in this context, the preclinical data and extensive understanding of its molecular interactions support the continued development of BBG for CKD therapy (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nReferences  \nArulkumaran, N.

The compound belongs to a class of agents that includes disubstituted tetrazoles and cyanoguanidine derivatives, which have been characterized by their ability to selectively block P2X7 receptor activation without significantly affecting other P2X subtypes. Its design and synthesis were initially achieved by pharmaceutical research groups (notably Abbott Laboratories as indicated in early publications) and have since been commercialized by companies such as Tocris (catalog #2947). This class of compounds was originally optimized for studies in inflammatory processes and pain models, as they inhibit ATP‐induced ion flux such as calcium influx and potassium efflux, a key factor in the activation cascade of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nBiochemically and pharmacologically, A-438079 has been investigated in various preclinical models for its ability to mitigate inflammation. It has demonstrated efficacy in rodent models of neuropathic pain and inflammatory conditions by inhibiting P2X7-mediated IL-1β release. In terms of renal applications, there is evidence from several studies that selective P2X7 antagonism can protect against kidney insults such as ischemia-reperfusion injury and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. For example, Zhang et al. (2014) showed that blocking P2X7 with antagonists like A-438079 attenuated cisplatin-induced renal tubular damage by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis markers in mice (Zhang et al., 2014). Additionally, studies such as those by Arulkumaran (2016) and colleagues have demonstrated that while genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of P2X7 in some models does not always equate to improved renal function, the block of P2X7-related signaling reduces inflammasome activation and cytokine release in immune cells and tubular epithelium (Arulkumaran, 2016; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Even though A-438079 has not been widely tested clinically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), its pharmacological profile as a P2X7 antagonist has been well characterized in biochemical studies and preclinical kidney injury models. This builds an indirect but strong rationale for repurposing it in CKD contexts, where sustained inflammation and fibrosis are major pathogenic drivers (Birch et al., 2013; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe primary mechanism of A-438079 is its high-affinity, selective antagonism of the P2X7 receptor. The P2X7 receptor is unique among the P2X family in its requirement for high concentrations of ATP, which are typically achieved in pathological conditions involving cell injury and inflammation. Under normal conditions, extracellular ATP levels are low; however, during tissue damage, ATP is released into the extracellular space where it binds to and activates P2X7 receptors expressed on immune cells (especially macrophages) and renal tubular epithelial cells (Han et al., 2020; Howarth, 2020).  \n\nUpon binding of ATP to the receptor, P2X7 undergoes a conformational change that opens its ion channel, permitting the influx of calcium ions and the efflux of potassium ions. This potassium efflux is a critical upstream event that triggers the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex responsible for activating caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 then cleaves the precursors of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature, secreted forms. These cytokines play major roles in propagating inflammatory signals, inducing pyroptosis (a form of inflammatory cell death), and promoting fibrotic remodeling in affected tissues (Qian et al., 2021; Shokoples, 2022).\n\nA-438079 interacts with the P2X7 receptor by competitively inhibiting ATP binding, thereby preventing the channel’s conformational change and subsequent ion flux. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) is approximately 40 nM in rodent models, indicating high potency (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). By blocking this pathway, A-438079 inhibits downstream events including NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 cleavage, and the release of IL-1β, ultimately reducing inflammatory responses and preventing the activation of fibrotic signaling pathways in kidney tissue, particularly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells where P2X7 and NLRP3 are highly expressed (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the context of chronic kidney disease, the principal pathological mechanisms include persistent inflammation and fibrosis, processes that are significantly driven by inflammasome activation in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. The hypothesis postulates that A-438079 will block ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor in these cell types. By doing so, it prevents the crucial potassium efflux that is necessary for the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The expected downstream effects include a reduction in caspase-1 activation, decreased cleavage of pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β, and ultimately lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This chain of events is anticipated to reduce pyroptosis and curb the progression of fibrosis within the kidney (Qian et al., 2021; Arulkumaran et al., 2018).\n\nRenal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells are known to express both the P2X7 receptor and NLRP3, as evidenced by various studies outlining their roles in mediating inflammation-driven fibrosis in CKD (Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020). In assays, it is expected that treatment with A-438079 would result in a measurable decrease in IL-1β release, reduced markers of inflammation such as caspase-1 activity, and potentially lower expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components. Furthermore, by blunting chronic inflammatory responses, A-438079 may help to preserve kidney structure and function, thereby slowing the progression of CKD. The compound’s favorable pharmacokinetic properties—particularly its demonstrated bioavailability and minimal off-target effects—support the feasibility of achieving these outcomes (Burnstock, 2017).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nA-438079 presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on several factors. One of its major strengths lies in its selectivity and potency as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, which allows it to precisely target an upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that is centrally implicated in CKD. The ability of A-438079 to block ATP-induced ion flux is particularly compelling because it interrupts the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a known driver of IL-1β and IL-18 release in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells (Arulkumaran, 2016; Qian et al., 2021). This molecular specificity holds promise for reducing inflammation and subsequent fibrotic formation in the kidney, both of which are critical elements in CKD progression.\n\nThe preclinical evidence supporting the use of P2X7 antagonists in models of acute kidney injury, such as cisplatin nephrotoxicity and sepsis-induced renal injury, provides additional rationale, even though such models are not perfect surrogates for CKD (Zhang et al., 2014; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Some studies have demonstrated that selective P2X7 blockade can attenuate inflammatory cytokine production, improve renal function markers, and reduce cell death, thereby supporting the hypothesis that similar benefits could be realized in chronic inflammatory settings like CKD (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nAdditionally, the mechanistic details of P2X7 receptor signaling – requiring high extracellular ATP concentrations, initiating K+ efflux, and triggering inflammasome assembly – align closely with the known processes of renal inflammation and fibrosis. The fact that P2X7 and NLRP3 are co-expressed in key renal cell populations reinforces the logic behind using A-438079 to target these pathways (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and potential challenges that need to be considered. Firstly, in some preclinical models, especially in certain rat strains (as noted by studies involving P2X7 receptor knockout rats), the inhibition or deletion of P2X7 did not significantly alter renal function or prevent kidney injury induced by hypertensive factors such as angiotensin II (Nespoux et al., 2024). This suggests that compensatory pathways may exist, and the role of P2X7 might be context-dependent or vary among species. Secondly, clinical trials of P2X7 antagonists in other inflammatory diseases have had mixed outcomes, raising concerns about translational efficacy in human CKD (Luz et al., 2019). Moreover, while the mechanism of inflammasome inhibition is well understood in vitro, the in vivo pharmacodynamics in the kidney may be complicated by variable local ATP concentrations and the dynamic expression of the receptor in disease states.\n\nFrom a drug development standpoint, the potency (IC50 ~40 nM) and reported good bioavailability of A-438079 are advantageous. Its minimal off-target effects also reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions in clinical translation. However, more robust and specific data in CKD models are necessary to establish whether the attenuation of IL-1β release can consistently translate into meaningful improvements in renal fibrosis and overall kidney function over long-term treatment courses (Chen et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2024).\n\nIn summary, A-438079’s targeted inhibition of the P2X7 receptor offers a novel approach to halt the ATP-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby mitigating a key upstream trigger of inflammatory cascades in CKD. Its preclinical track record in inflammatory and renal injury models, combined with its mechanistic specificity, positions it as a strong candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease. Nonetheless, species variability, redundant inflammatory pathways, and the need for further in vivo validation in models of long-term kidney disease remain potential hurdles. If these challenges are addressed in further preclinical and early clinical studies, A-438079 could represent a significant advance in targeting the inflammation-fibrosis axis in CKD (Arulkumaran et al., 2018; Fantauzzi, 2013; Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe strengths of A-438079 for CKD include its high potency, selectivity, and well-elucidated mechanism of action in blocking ATP-induced P2X7 receptor activation—a critical initiator of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. These molecular interactions have been robustly characterized in multiple preclinical studies, indicating that the drug may effectively reduce IL-1β-mediated inflammation and subsequent fibrotic responses. In models of acute renal injury, antagonizing P2X7 has led to reduced cell death and improved renal function, which supports its potential usage in CKD where chronic inflammation is a driver of progressive fibrosis. Moreover, the chemical class to which A-438079 belongs has been extensively employed in studies of inflammatory diseases, reinforcing the feasibility of this approach (Deplano, 2012; Qian et al., 2021).\n\nConversely, potential weaknesses lie in the heterogeneity of experimental outcomes across different preclinical models and species. Some studies have shown that genetic deletion of P2X7 in rats does not always confer renal protection in induced kidney injury, suggesting that the pathophysiology in certain species—or even specific CKD etiologies—may be driven by redundant pathways beyond P2X7/NLRP3. In addition, although A-438079 demonstrates promising in vitro efficacy, there remains a critical need for long-term in vivo studies specifically in CKD models to verify that its anti-inflammatory effects translate into clinically meaningful outcomes in terms of preservation of renal function and reduction in fibrosis. Lastly, it is important to consider potential compensatory mechanisms in chronic inflammation that may limit the sole efficacy of P2X7 inhibition (Nespoux et al., 2024; Luz et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, A-438079 is a scientifically compelling therapeutic candidate for CKD, with robust mechanistic support and significant preclinical evidence in inflammatory models. Its ability to target the P2X7/NLRP3 axis addresses a novel therapeutic area in CKD by potentially halting the progression of inflammation-driven fibrosis. However, potential limitations due to species-specific responses and redundancy in inflammatory signaling must be carefully evaluated in future studies. Overall, A-438079 merits further investigation as part of a multi-pronged approach to modulate inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in chronic kidney disease (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:  \nArulkumaran, N.

"(CY-09, 7)","(INF4E, 4)","Both INF4E and CY-09 target the NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting ATPase activity in the NACHT domain and share the goal of reducing IL-1β/IL-18 release and pyroptosis in CKD. INF4E is an acrylate Michael-acceptor that irreversibly modifies a cysteine in the NACHT domain, yielding prolonged inhibition but raising concerns about off-target covalent toxicity and cytotoxicity under hypoxic renal conditions. Its preclinical efficacy has been demonstrated in sepsis, IBD, and cardiac ischemia models, but there are no direct in vivo CKD data, and the safety profile in renal models remains uncharacterized. CY-09 is a thiazolidinone derivative that competitively binds the Walker A motif, blocking ATP without covalent chemistry. It exhibits nanomolar potency, high selectivity (no NF-κB or other PRR interference), demonstrated oral bioavailability, and an encouraging safety profile in rodent studies. Although direct CKD studies with CY-09 are limited, genetic and pharmacological NLRP3 inhibition (e.g., MCC950) has robustly protected against renal inflammation and fibrosis in multiple CKD models, lending strong translational relevance to CY-09. Its mechanism has been rigorously validated by pull-down assays and docking models. From a safety, specificity, and translatability standpoint, CY-09 poses less off‐target risk and has a more complete preclinical package, whereas INF4E’s irreversible covalent mechanism and lack of renal safety data are concerning for chronic use in CKD.","CY-09 outranks INF4E across key criteria: it has a well-characterized, reversible, highly selective MoA, robust nanomolar potency, documented oral PK, and an established safety margin in rodents. Its mechanism of competitive ATP binding has been validated by biochemical pull-down and docking studies, minimizing off-target liabilities. Although neither compound has direct CKD clinical data, the extensive preclinical success of NLRP3 blockade in renal fibrosis models strongly supports CY-09’s translational potential. In contrast, INF4E’s irreversible covalent chemistry raises cytotoxicity risks, and its lack of direct renal efficacy or safety data undermines confidence for chronic CKD application. Therefore, CY-09 offers a superior balance of mechanistic clarity, safety, feasibility, and relevance to CKD pathology.",37,"(4, 7)","{'hypothesis': 'INF4E (Tocris, catalog #5903)', 'answer': 'Proposal for INF4E (Tocris, catalog #5903)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nINF4E is a synthetic electrophilic small‐molecule inhibitor that was initially discovered through phenotypic screening in macrophage models testing for NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. It is an acrylate derivative belonging to a class of compounds that harness α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl (Michael acceptor) functionalities to achieve covalent, irreversible inhibition of target proteins. Its discovery emerged during screening campaigns that looked for submicromolar potency against NLRP3, with subsequent chemical optimization to balance reactivity and cytotoxicity. Specifically, INF4E (also referred to in some studies as compound 9) was identified for its ability to selectively inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation by binding covalently to the NACHT domain’s ATP‐binding site, thereby interfering with ATP hydrolysis required for the conformational changes that lead to inflammasome assembly (Cocco et al., 2017; Blevins et al., 2022). As a member of the acrylate derivatives class, similar compounds have been explored in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular disorders, where targeting NLRP3 has shown promise. Members of this chemical class have a well‐documented history of being used as selective covalent modifiers with potential in modulating inflammatory signaling cascades.  \n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of INF4E and its related chemical family primarily stems from preclinical studies where they have been shown to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in various models of inflammation. INF4E was originally validated in sepsis models, demonstrating efficacy in reducing systemic inflammation, and subsequent studies extended its utility to show anti‐pyroptotic effects in macrophage cell lines with submicromolar potency. Moreover, related acrylate derivatives have been explored in inflammatory bowel disease models, where modifications to reduce cytotoxicity led to the generation of analogues such as INF39. Although the preclinical literature for this class of inhibitors is robust in the context of sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, and even in models of ischemic injury in the heart, there is no direct literature evidence that INF4E has been specifically used for treating chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis. Searches in Clinical Trials databases for “NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have revealed only nascent clinical exploration of NLRP3 inhibitors in renal disease, with most candidates like MCC950 and OLT1177 being at early development stages (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023). Thus, while INF4E’s mechanism of NLRP3 inhibition is highly relevant to inflammatory processes, its therapeutic history in kidney disease remains limited to preclinical mechanistic rationale rather than established clinical or veterinary use in CKD.  \n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, INF4E exerts its action by covalently binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, specifically targeting its ATP‐binding site. The NACHT domain is essential for NLRP3 oligomerization and subsequent inflammasome assembly. INF4E’s acrylate (Michael acceptor) moiety reacts with cysteine residues present in this domain, thereby irreversibly blocking ATP hydrolysis. The inhibition of ATP hydrolysis interferes directly with the required conformational changes that transform NLRP3 from an inactive to an active state capable of recruiting the adaptor protein ASC and procaspase‐1. Consequently, the subsequent cleavage of caspase‐1 is prevented, which in turn stops the maturation and release of key pro‐inflammatory cytokines, notably IL‐1β and IL‐18 (Mezzaroma et al., 2021; Cocco et al., 2017).  \nThis covalent binding mechanism is particularly significant because it offers prolonged inhibitory effects owing to its irreversible nature. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, where hypoxia serves as a potent priming signal for inflammasome activation and contributes to chronic inflammation and fibrosis, inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E is hypothesized to prevent the cascade leading to caspase‐1 activation, thus mitigating caspase‐1–dependent pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death—and reducing the release of IL‐18 (Blevins et al., 2022; Komada & Muruve, 2019).  \nThe biochemical interactions of INF4E align with the known structure–activity relationships of electrophilic acrylate derivatives, as these compounds are designed to target the ATPase activity of NLRP3. By interfering with this enzymatic function, INF4E halts the nucleation of the inflammasome complex, thereby curtailing downstream signaling that ultimately leads to pyroptosis and fibrogenesis. The short-lived yet potent irreversible binding is a hallmark of this class of inhibitors, which has been exploited in several preclinical studies to provide a potent blockade of inflammation (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the context of the proposed assay and the underlying pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease, INF4E is anticipated to exhibit a therapeutic effect by mitigating hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation in proximal tubular epithelial cells. Hypoxic conditions are known to prime and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in these cells, and this process is a major contributor to tubular cell injury, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenic signaling—all key drivers of CKD progression.  \nThe expected outcome when applying INF4E would be a significant reduction in ATP hydrolysis that is crucial for NLRP3 activation, thereby preventing the subsequent assembly of the inflammasome complex. This inhibition should lead to a decrease in caspase‐1 activity, ultimately lowering the maturation and secretion of IL‐18 (and possibly IL‐1β). Reduced levels of IL‐18 would then limit the inflammatory and fibrogenic signaling cascades that promote the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis. In assays using hypoxic proximal tubular cells, one would therefore predict reduced markers of pyroptosis, improved cell viability, and a lower expression of fibrogenic proteins such as TGF-β and α-SMA.  \nThere is also supportive evidence that NLRP3 is expressed in proximal tubular cells and that its activation is directly linked to inflammatory responses and fibrosis under hypoxic conditions (Ochoa et al., 2023; Komada & Muruve, 2019). The selective inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E should thus translate into improved cellular integrity and a mitigated progression of the inflammatory milieu that typifies CKD. This expected modulation of pyroptosis and fibrosis markers provides a clear biochemical rationale for using INF4E as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic therapeutic candidate in kidney disease models.  \n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe analysis of INF4E as a repurposed drug candidate for chronic kidney disease presents both promising and challenging aspects. One major strength of INF4E lies in its clearly defined mechanism of action; by targeting the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and interfering with ATP hydrolysis, INF4E offers a direct method to abrogate inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. This is particularly relevant in CKD, where hypoxia-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in proximal tubular cells is a key pathological event leading to pyroptosis, inflammation, and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019).  \nAnother strength is its proven submicromolar potency as demonstrated in phenotypic screens, along with a degree of oral bioavailability in rodent models that supports the feasibility of future in vivo investigations (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021). This potency, combined with its specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome, positions INF4E as a candidate with the potential to modulate inflammatory responses without broadly suppressing the entire immune system. Moreover, by specifically reducing IL-18 release, INF4E may offer advantages over broader anti-inflammatory approaches that risk impairing normal host defense mechanisms (Thomas et al., 2022).  \nA potential weakness, however, is the risk associated with irreversible covalent binding, which, while conferring prolonged effects, may also lead to off-target toxicity if the selectivity is not absolute. Some acrylate derivatives have been noted for cytotoxicity issues, and although chemical optimization—such as the development of related compounds like INF39—has been undertaken to alleviate these concerns, it remains a critical point for evaluation in renal cells that are already susceptible to injury under hypoxic conditions (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \nFurthermore, while the mechanistic rationale for targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in CKD is strong, the clinical translation of NLRP3 inhibitors has been slow. Currently, only limited clinical trial data are available for NLRP3 inhibitors in CKD, and the majority of evidence remains at the preclinical level (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023).  \nAnother consideration is that chronic kidney disease is a multifactorial condition wherein inflammasome activation is just one of several pathogenic processes, including metabolic dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and oxidative stress. Therefore, while INF4E may effectively block one critical pathway—namely, hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation—it might need to be combined with therapies targeting other aspects of CKD pathogenesis to achieve a comprehensive therapeutic effect (Unknown Reference; Mulay, 2019).  \nDespite these challenges, INF4E’s selectivity for a mechanistically validated target, its oral availability, and its demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory models provide a strong rationale for further investigation. In assays designed to model hypoxic tubular injury, INF4E is expected to reduce pyroptosis and fibrogenic signaling, thereby slowing CKD progression. The drug’s success in other inflammatory contexts, such as sepsis models, lends additional weight to its potential, although caution must be exercised when extrapolating these data to the complex microenvironment of the kidney (Blevins et al., 2022; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \n\nContinued research should focus on dosing optimization, safety profiling in kidney-specific models, and investigation of combination strategies that target both inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in CKD (Komada & Muruve, 2019; Mulay, 2019; Pagliaro & Penna, 2023; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nOverall, INF4E represents a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for chronic kidney disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, which aligns well with an established pathogenic pathway in CKD—namely, hypoxia-driven NLRP3 inflammasome activation in proximal tubular cells. Its ability to block the ATPase activity of NLRP3, thereby preventing both caspase-1 activation and IL-18 release, underpins a novel strategy aimed at mitigating pyroptosis and subsequent fibrogenic signaling cascades. While challenges such as potential off-target cytotoxicity, the need for extensive in vivo validation in CKD models, and integration into a multifactorial therapeutic approach remain, the compelling preclinical data for related compounds and the rigorous mechanistic underpinnings provide a strong basis for advancing INF4E in further preclinical studies and eventual clinical trials. Continued research should include detailed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological evaluations in renal models, as well as assessments of its efficacy in reducing markers of inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrosis in hypoxic proximal tubular cells. Given the complexity of CKD, INF4E may ultimately be best suited for combination therapy alongside agents addressing complementary pathogenic mechanisms. Overall, the potential strengths of INF4E—rooted in its selective, irreversible inhibition of a well‐validated molecular target—are balanced by the need for careful evaluation of safety and clinical translatability in the setting of chronic kidney disease (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nReferences:  \nBlevins, H.

Chemically, CY-09 belongs to the class of thiazolidinone derivatives, a category known for its capacity to interfere with enzymatic activities via covalent or non-covalent interactions. Its development was driven by the need to specifically target the ATP-binding site within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, particularly focusing on the Walker A motif—a conserved nucleotide-binding region that is essential for the ATPase activity required for NLRP3 oligomerization. The design rationale behind CY-09 was based on structure-based drug design principles, where the compound was engineered to directly bind NLRP3, thereby preventing the conformational changes necessary for inflammasome assembly. This chemical class has previously been used in various contexts to modulate protein–enzyme interactions, and its application in inflammasome biology represents an evolution of this approach to target excessive inflammation mediated by the innate immune system (Jiang et al., 2017; Bertinaria et al., 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of CY-09 is rooted in preclinical studies where it has been extensively characterized in vitro and in animal models of inflammatory diseases. Initially, CY-09 demonstrated potent inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in murine bone marrow–derived macrophages stimulated with canonical activators such as ATP, nigericin, and monosodium urate crystals, showing a dose-dependent reduction in IL-1β secretion and caspase-1 activation. Its efficacy has been documented in rodent models of sepsis and colitis, as well as in metabolic disorder models where NLRP3-driven inflammation is a core pathological feature. Although no clinical trials having been completed in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) specifically have been reported to date, the compound’s inclusion in multiple clinical trial searches (ClinicalTrials.gov) indicates that there is active interest in repurposing or further evaluating NLRP3 inhibitors like CY-09 in kidney-related conditions. Furthermore, the extensive body of work demonstrating that NLRP3 knockout or pharmacological inhibition confers protection against renal fibrosis, tubular inflammation, and other hallmarks of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Zhou & Li, 2023) supports the translational potential of a molecule such as CY-09. Historically, similar NLRP3 inhibitors (for example, MCC950) have been applied in various preclinical models of inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and their protective effects in conditions like diabetic nephropathy and ischemia-reperfusion injury provide a strong rationale for applying CY-09 in CKD (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nCY-09 exerts its therapeutic action by directly binding to the NLRP3 protein at its NACHT domain, specifically targeting the Walker A (or P-loop) motif responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis. This binding event competitively inhibits ATP from accessing the site, thereby blocking the ATPase activity essential for NLRP3 oligomerization. Without ATP hydrolysis, NLRP3 is unable to undergo the conformational rearrangements necessary for the aggregation of multiple NLRP3 molecules into the inflammasome complex. Consequently, the formation of the adaptor protein ASC specks is prevented, leading to a blockade of pro-caspase-1 activation and subsequent cleavage into its active form. This chain of events ultimately results in a reduction of the maturation and secretion of the central proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and it halts gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis—a form of lytic, inflammatory cell death that substantially contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis in CKD. Importantly, studies have demonstrated that CY-09 does not interfere with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, underscoring its molecular specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2019). The molecular interaction of CY-09 is supported by biotinylated pull-down assays which confirm its selective binding to NLRP3 over other inflammasome components, and computational docking models corroborate a binding mode that is competitive with ATP at the Walker A motif (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017). This detailed molecular mechanism signifies that CY-09 operates at an early and critical step in the inflammasome pathway, making it a highly attractive candidate for diseases with a significant inflammatory component, such as CKD (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe proposed hypothesis for applying CY-09 to CKD is that by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in human proximal tubular epithelial cells, the compound will inhibit ATPase-driven oligomerization of NLRP3, thereby reducing the formation of ASC specks, the activation of caspase-1, and the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. The downstream effect of blocking these events is the inhibition of gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis, which is known to drive tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrotic remodeling—a central hallmark in the progression of CKD. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, NLRP3 is expressed and activated in response to various stress stimuli, including oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and metabolic dysregulation, all of which are common in CKD pathogenesis. By impeding this pathway, CY-09 is expected to diminish inflammatory cytokine secretion and reduce cell death, thereby preserving tubular integrity, minimizing interstitial inflammation, and preventing the fibrotic changes that culminate in renal function decline (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Data from preclinical models of kidney injury, such as those using MCC950 and other NLRP3 knockout models, have consistently shown improvements in renal structure and function, and reduction in profibrotic markers upon inhibition of the NLRP3 pathway (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017). Furthermore, oral bioavailability and a favorable safety profile in rodent studies enhance the clinical feasibility of CY-09 as a repurposed agent for CKD (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The expected effects in a CKD model would therefore include reduced extracellular matrix deposition, lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the renal interstitium, and overall attenuation of the fibrotic process, translating ultimately into stabilization of renal function (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nBased on the comprehensive literature review, CY-09 emerges as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease. One of its greatest strengths lies in its robust and specific mechanism of action; by directly binding to the Walker A motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3, CY-09 efficiently prevents the initial ATP-driven steps that are critical for inflammasome assembly. This targeted inhibition ensures that downstream activation events—namely ASC speck formation, caspase-1 activation, and subsequent IL-1β/IL-18 maturation—are effectively suppressed. Such specificity is critical for minimizing off-target effects, as CY-09 has shown no significant interference with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, which could reduce undesirable immunosuppressive side effects (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The repurposing strategy is further supported by extensive preclinical evidence indicating that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 results in marked protection against renal fibrosis and inflammation in various CKD models. The preclinical efficacy of similar NLRP3 inhibitors such as MCC950 in models of diabetic nephropathy, cisplatin-induced renal injury, and ischemia-reperfusion injury reinforces the therapeutic potential of targeting NLRP3 in kidney disease (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017).\n\nAnother significant strength of CY-09 is its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile in rodent studies, which is an important consideration for chronic administration required in CKD therapy (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). This pharmacokinetic profile, along with the compound’s high potency in inflammatory assays where nanomolar inhibitory effects have been observed, provides confidence that CY-09 could achieve therapeutically effective concentrations in the kidney without systemic toxicity.\n\nHowever, there are also challenges and uncertainties. Although extensive preclinical studies in inflammatory disease models support the potential of CY-09, direct evidence of its efficacy in chronic kidney disease models specifically remains limited. The majority of studies to date have focused on sepsis, metabolic disorders, and murine colitis rather than on kidney-specific outcomes. There is, therefore, a need for more targeted preclinical research in CKD models—including those mimicking diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and cisplatin-induced renal fibrosis—to definitively establish the renoprotective effects of CY-09 (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Additionally, while the mechanism is well-characterized in immune cells like macrophages, further studies need to elucidate its effects specifically in human proximal tubular epithelial cells and other renal cell types that contribute to CKD progression. Such studies should evaluate not only biochemical markers of inflammasome activation but also functional outcomes like proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate, and histological indices of fibrosis.\n\nAnother potential weakness concerns the translational gap between rodent models and human CKD. The pathophysiology of CKD is multifactorial, and while NLRP3-mediated inflammation is a key driver, the disease process involves many convergent signaling pathways including TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling and oxidative stress pathways. It is possible that the blockade of NLRP3 alone may not be sufficient to fully arrest disease progression in humans. In addition, although CY-09 appears selective based on current evidence, there is always the risk of off-target effects when a compound modulates ATPase activity, given the abundance of ATP-binding proteins in the cell. Careful profiling of CY-09 against a broad spectrum of other ATPases and kinases will be necessary to confirm its selectivity in a clinical setting (Sandall et al., 2020).\n\nIn summary, CY-09 represents an innovative and mechanistically compelling therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease due to its direct inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a central mediator of renal inflammation and fibrosis. Its synthesis as a thiazolidinone derivative and its proven ability to bind the Walker A motif within the NACHT domain underscore its potential to precisely block inflammasome-driven pyroptosis. Preclinical evidence from models of various inflammatory conditions, along with robust biochemical data demonstrating nanomolar potency in macrophage assays, provides a strong rationale for its repurposing in kidney disease. Furthermore, its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety in rodent studies enhance its translational appeal. Nonetheless, additional research is needed to specifically validate its efficacy in CKD models, assess its long-term safety, and determine its pharmacodynamic effects in kidney-specific cell types such as proximal tubular epithelial cells. Overall, the strengths of CY-09’s targeted mechanism, coupled with supportive preclinical efficacy data from related inflammatory models, make it a promising candidate for further development and evaluation in Chronic Kidney Disease (ClinicalTrials.gov; Jiang et al., 2017; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nBertinaria, M., Gastaldi, S., Marini, E., & Giorgis, M.

"(Disulfiram, 0)","(Oridonin, 6)","Both candidates target inflammatory cell death pathways implicated in CKD, but via distinct mechanisms and with different levels of evidence and translational readiness. Candidate 1 (Disulfiram) has a well‐characterized safety profile from decades of clinical use in alcohol aversion, established oral bioavailability, and detailed mechanistic data showing covalent inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis. Preclinical models of ischemia–reperfusion acute kidney injury demonstrate that disulfiram suppresses the caspase-11–GSDMD axis and ameliorates renal dysfunction. The key gaps are a lack of long-term CKD or fibrosis models and optimized dosing for chronic administration. Candidate 2 (Oridonin) is a natural diterpenoid that covalently inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome via Cys279, with nanomolar potency and additional anti-NF-κB and antioxidative effects. Preclinical rodent studies in diabetic nephropathy and acute kidney injury show renoprotection, but direct evidence in podocytes or chronic fibrosis models is limited. Oridonin faces challenges in solubility, bioavailability, and the need for formulation optimization. It also lacks the depth of clinical safety data that disulfiram possesses. While both candidates are mechanistically plausible and novel, disulfiram combines a direct, downstream blockade of pyroptosis with an established human safety profile and feasible PK/PD, giving it a clear translational advantage over oridonin, which requires more extensive preclinical validation and formulation work.","Disulfiram is superior because it directly inhibits the terminal effector of pyroptosis (GSDMD) in a mechanism highly relevant to CKD pathogenesis, has demonstrated efficacy in renal injury models, and benefits from a decades-long clinical safety record that accelerates repurposing. Oridonin, though promising as an NLRP3 inhibitor, relies on upstream inflammasome blockade, has less direct evidence in kidney cell types central to CKD (podocytes and tubular cells), and faces pharmacokinetic and formulation hurdles. Given the importance of safety, translatability, and direct mechanism, disulfiram has the higher probability of experimental success and clinical translation in CKD.",38,"(0, 6)","{'hypothesis': 'Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nDisulfiram is a synthetic small‐molecule drug originally discovered more than seventy years ago and is well known for its unique chemical structure featuring a tetraethylthiuram disulfide core. It is typically synthesized via the oxidation of diethyldithiocarbamate salts derived from the reaction of carbon disulfide with diethylamine, producing a compound with a central disulfide bond that confers its thiol‐reactive properties (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13). Chemically, disulfiram belongs to the dithiocarbamate family and is classified pharmacologically as an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor. Historically, this inhibition of ALDH has been the molecular basis for its clinical application as an alcohol aversion agent, where disulfiram induces the accumulation of acetaldehyde following alcohol ingestion, causing an assortment of discomforting physiological effects such as flushing, nausea, and tachycardia (Lu et al., 2021, p. 12). More recently, however, disulfiram has assumed a new identity in drug repurposing initiatives; its ability to interact covalently with cysteine residues in target proteins – a consequence of its thiuram disulfide structure – has attracted considerable attention in the context of inflammatory diseases. In particular, its capacity to interfere with the function of gasdermin D (GSDMD) via covalent modification is emerging as a promising mechanism by which disulfiram could counteract pathological inflammatory pathways (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4). This newly recognized activity places disulfiram within a therapeutic class of established drugs that are being re‐evaluated beyond their original indications, seeking to exploit their long clinical history and known safety profiles for novel applications such as the modulation of pyroptosis in inflammatory pathologies like chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nDisulfiram has a long-established history, primarily being used in the management of chronic alcohol use disorder since its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the early 1950s. As a stand‐alone therapy, its effectiveness in producing a pronounced aversive reaction to ethanol intake has made it a mainstay in addiction medicine. Over the decades, disulfiram has been administered safely to vast numbers of patients – a fact that is of critical importance when considering repurposing efforts, as its pharmacokinetics, dosing parameters, and toxicity profiles are well documented (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3). In addition to its established role in alcohol abstinence, disulfiram has been repurposed for a number of other applications. Emerging investigations have highlighted its promising activity in malignancies, where disulfiram, often in conjunction with supplemental copper, has demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against cancer stem cells via mechanisms that involve proteasome inhibition and modulation of redox homeostasis (Lu et al., 2021, pp. 13–14; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). More recently, its anti-inflammatory potential has been explored in the context of infectious diseases and systemic inflammatory responses. For instance, disulfiram has been evaluated in sepsis models, where its inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis led to reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines and improved survival in animal models (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). In models of ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), disulfiram pretreatment was shown to ameliorate renal dysfunction and histological damage by suppressing the noncanonical caspase-11–GSDMD inflammatory axis (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6). Although direct clinical studies of disulfiram in chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis remain limited, the encouraging preclinical signals from acute kidney insults and its capacity to modulate cell death pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation suggest that disulfiram—and its metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate—might be effective in attenuating the injurious inflammatory cascades observed in CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, the repurposing hypothesis for disulfiram in chronic kidney disease centers on its recently identified inhibitory effect on gasdermin D (GSDMD), a pore-forming effector protein that is indispensable for the execution of pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory, lytic form of programmed cell death triggered by the activation of inflammasomes. When these multiprotein complexes form in response to pathogenic stimuli or sterile injury, they lead to the activation of inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1, and in noncanonical pathways, caspase-4/5/11. These enzymes cleave GSDMD to generate an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) that oligomerizes and inserts into the plasma membrane to form pores, thereby releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) into the extracellular milieu (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17). Disulfiram has been shown to block this crucial terminal step in pyroptosis by covalently modifying a conserved cysteine residue (Cys191 in human GSDMD and Cys192 in murine GSDMD) through a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. This chemical modification prevents the oligomerization and subsequent membrane pore formation by GSDMD, thereby directly inhibiting the execution phase of pyroptosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). Moreover, disulfiram’s activity is potentiated in the presence of copper ions, which may stabilize its reactive metabolites such as diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC), enhancing its inhibitory potency in cellular assays (Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18). The outcome of this inhibition is a significant reduction in the pyroptotic cell death cascade, as evidenced by decreased IL-1β release and overall attenuation of inflammatory signaling. In the context of the kidney, specifically within tubular epithelial cells (TECs), the inflammatory microenvironment driven by inflammasome activation is one of the critical factors in the progression from acute injury to chronic fibrosis. TECs are known to express inflammasome components and are susceptible to pyroptosis, which contributes to interstitial inflammation and fibrogenesis (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Therefore, by inhibiting the cleavage and activation of GSDMD in these cells, disulfiram has the potential to preserve tubular integrity and prevent the inflammatory cascade that ultimately drives chronic kidney injury.\n\nExpected Effect:  \nBased on the proposed hypothesis and data from related inflammatory and renal injury models, disulfiram is predicted to exert a protective effect in the setting of chronic kidney disease by targeting the final common pathway of pyroptotic cell death. In a typical in vitro assay using primary tubular epithelial cells or established TEC lines, treatment with disulfiram at concentrations within the non-cytotoxic range (e.g., 0.1–5 µM as indicated in hypoxia/reoxygenation models) is expected to prevent the formation of GSDMD pores, thereby reducing cell membrane disruption, limiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18), and preserving cell viability (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11). The expected molecular signature following disulfiram treatment would include decreased levels of cleaved (active) GSDMD, reduced caspase-11 activation along with lower concentrations of circulating cytokines, as well as preserved markers of epithelial cell integrity. Given that GSDMD and components of the inflammasome are expressed in tubular epithelial cells (as supported by studies focusing on renal inflammatory pathways; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 7–9; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 9–10), the inhibition of GSDMD pore formation directly addresses a mechanistic driver of tubular injury. This would translate into reduced interstitial inflammation and limited myofibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition, which are critical steps in the fibrotic process that underpins CKD progression (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Ultimately, the expectation is that a therapeutic regimen involving disulfiram may slow or even halt the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease by mitigating the damaging effects of pyroptosis.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nDisulfiram presents several attractive features as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. The strengths of disulfiram include:  \n1. A well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profile, supported by decades of clinical use in alcohol aversion therapy, which facilitates rapid translation into new clinical contexts (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Lu et al., 2021, p. 12).  \n2. A clear and innovative mechanism of action based on the inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis. This mechanism is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of CKD, where inflammasome activation and resultant pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells contribute to interstitial inflammation and fibrosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11).  \n3. The potential for its active metabolite, diethyldithiocarbamate, and the enhancing role of copper complexation to improve its potency as a pyroptosis inhibitor further bolster the therapeutic rationale (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18; Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34).  \n4. Preclinical evidence in models of acute kidney injury (ischemia-reperfusion injury) demonstrates that disulfiram can ameliorate renal dysfunction through inhibition of the caspase-11–GSDMD axis, suggesting that similar effects may be achieved in chronic inflammatory settings underlying CKD (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11).  \n\nHowever, there are also potential weaknesses and gaps that warrant further exploration:  \n1. Despite promising preclinical data in acute injury models and other inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, direct evidence of disulfiram’s efficacy in chronic kidney disease models remains limited. The available studies do not present long-term data specific to CKD or renal fibrosis, which is critical for validating its use in a chronic condition (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6).  \n2. While the mechanism of covalent modification of GSDMD at Cys191 is well supported by molecular studies, the extrapolation of these findings to tubular epithelial cells in the kidney (as opposed to macrophages or other inflammatory cells) requires additional confirmation. It is essential to verify that TECs exhibit similar susceptibility to the gasdermin D inhibitory effects of disulfiram under pathological conditions (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n3. Dosage optimization, chronic toxicity assessments, and potential off-target effects in the renal context have not yet been extensively characterized. Although the historical human use of disulfiram supports a favorable safety profile, the dosing regimen for CKD might differ from that used for alcohol aversion therapy, given the distinct pharmacodynamics required to inhibit pyroptosis in kidney tissues (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8).  \n4. Another consideration is the effect of systemic modulation of pyroptosis. Since pyroptosis is integral to effective immune responses under certain circumstances, indiscriminate long-term inhibition could potentially compromise host defenses against infections. This balance between therapeutic efficacy in CKD and preservation of necessary immune functions must be carefully evaluated in preclinical models and eventually in clinical trials (Hu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n\nIn summary, disulfiram emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease due to its novel mechanism of targeting gasdermin D-induced pyroptosis—a pathway that is increasingly recognized as a critical driver of renal inflammation and fibrogenesis. Its long clinical history, established oral bioavailability, and well-characterized safety profile offer substantial advantages that could accelerate its translation into CKD-focused studies. The evidence from acute kidney injury models and inflammatory disease research forms a strong mechanistic rationale for its use to preserve tubular epithelial integrity and mitigate interstitial inflammation. Nevertheless, further detailed studies are imperative to validate its effectiveness in chronic kidney models, delineate optimal dosing strategies, and ensure that the inhibition of pyroptosis does not adversely affect normal immune surveillance. Based on the data reviewed—from biochemical studies demonstrating covalent modification of GSDMD (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8) to preclinical studies in renal injury models (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6)—the overall evaluation supports continued investigation of disulfiram as a repurposed agent in CKD. Its potential to modulate a critical pathogenic pathway in chronic kidney injury could represent a novel therapeutic intervention that merits further preclinical and clinical development (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18).\n\nReferences  \nCai, Q., Sun, Z., Xu, S., Jiao, X., Guo, S., Li, Y., Wu, H., & Yu, X.

As a kaurane-type diterpenoid, its structure comprises four isoprene units arranged into a characteristic tetracyclic skeleton, which is emblematic of this class of natural products. The compound’s discovery and development emerged from the long-standing tradition of using Rabdosia rubescens (also known as Donglingcao) in Asian folk medicine, where it was historically applied for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In the broader context of drug development, diterpenoids such as oridonin have been recognized for their “drug-like” properties; they have provided scaffolds for synthetic modifications aimed at improving potency, solubility, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Moreover, the extraction and study of oridonin reflect an important paradigm in natural products research, wherein historical use is validated and expanded upon with modern medicinal chemistry techniques. This compound, commercially available from suppliers like Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #O2015), fits well within the class of small-molecule natural products that have been repurposed for modern therapeutic applications in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases (Ding et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOridonin’s use spans a broad spectrum of therapeutic applications. Traditionally, the herbal preparations containing oridonin were employed in Chinese medicine to alleviate conditions ranging from pharyngitis and gingivitis to various inflammatory and tumorous conditions. With the advent of modern biochemical and pharmacological research, oridonin has been extensively studied for its anticancer efficacy; many preclinical studies have demonstrated its capacity to induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and suppress metastasis in a variety of cancer cell lines (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In addition to its anticancer properties, several studies have documented oridonin’s robust anti-inflammatory actions. Notably, oridonin has shown efficacy in experimental models of colitis and gout through its inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that mediates the maturation of IL-1β and is a critical driver of inflammatory responses (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020). Although most of the historical and ongoing research has emphasized oridonin’s anticancer and acute inflammatory indications, there is emerging interest in its potential role in renal pathologies. A search on ClinicalTrials.gov using terms such as “Oridonin AND kidney OR renal OR chronic kidney disease OR glomerulonephritis OR proteinuria OR glomerular” returned tens of thousands of trials, indicating significant research activity into natural products and potentially repurposed compounds for kidney diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, to date there is limited direct clinical evidence of oridonin being deployed specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preclinical studies, particularly those involving rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and ischemia–reperfusion injury, have demonstrated renoprotective effects such as reduced inflammatory cytokine levels, diminished fibrosis markers, and improved renal function parameters; these effects suggest that oridonin or its derivatives might be promising candidates for treating CKD or similar renal conditions (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, oridonin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects primarily through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex known to activate caspase-1 and mediate the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. Recent mechanistic studies have shown that oridonin covalently binds to cysteine 279 within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, a critical residue required for the ATPase activity of NLRP3 and its subsequent oligomerization (He et al., 2018). This binding effectively prevents the conformational changes necessary for the recruitment of NEK7, thereby halting inflammasome assembly and activation. In macrophages, this inhibition leads to a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and attenuates inflammatory cell recruitment—a mechanism that has been validated through pull‐down assays and mass spectrometry, which demonstrated nanomolar potency of oridonin in suppressing NLRP3 activation (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020).\n\nBeyond its direct interaction with the NLRP3 inflammasome, oridonin has been shown to modulate additional signaling pathways. For example, it can inhibit NF-κB and p38-MAPK activation, further blunting the inflammatory response, and it has been implicated in the activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidative defenses at lower concentrations, contributing to its cytoprotective effects (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019). These multifaceted actions underscore the polypharmacological nature of oridonin: while its primary mode of action appears to involve covalent modification of NLRP3, its downstream effects extend into a broader anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative network. This convergence on inflammatory signaling pathways is particularly relevant because overactivation of the inflammasome and subsequent pyroptotic cell death are implicated not only in acute inflammatory diseases but also in chronic fibrotic processes within the kidney (Ding et al., 2020).\n\nExpanding the context to renal pathology, the hypothesis driving our proposal is that human podocytes—which are essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier—express components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of NLRP3 in these cells has been linked to pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, which in turn contributes to podocyte loss, proteinuria, and interstitial fibrosis, all hallmarks of CKD. Although most direct evidence of oridonin’s NLRP3 inhibition comes from studies in immune cells like macrophages (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2016), the underlying mechanism is conserved across cell types. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that oridonin could similarly inhibit NLRP3 activation in podocytes, thereby preventing inflammasome assembly, blocking caspase-1 activation, and ultimately reducing the release of IL-1β (Li et al., 2021). By precluding these downstream events, oridonin may attenuate the cycle of inflammatory damage and fibrosis that underpins progressive renal injury in CKD (Li et al., 2021).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the proposed assays and eventual in vivo models of chronic kidney disease, the expected effect of oridonin centers on its ability to protect podocytes from NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated injury. More specifically, by covalently binding to cysteine 279 in NLRP3, oridonin is anticipated to inhibit ATP hydrolysis and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex. This mechanistic blockade should result in a reduction of caspase-1 activation—a key step in the maturation of IL-1β—and thereby diminish the secretion of this potent pro-inflammatory cytokine (He et al., 2018). In podocytes, such suppression is expected to reduce pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death that directly compromises the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and leads to proteinuria. Preservation of podocyte viability would, in turn, help maintain glomerular barrier integrity, minimizing the leakage of plasma proteins into the urine and limiting the ensuing fibrotic response in the renal interstitium (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nMoreover, the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB and p38-MAPK signaling pathways could provide additional benefits by reducing overall renal inflammation. In animal models of kidney injury—such as those induced by ischemia–reperfusion or diabetic nephropathy—treatment with compounds that inhibit these pathways has been correlated with improved renal function parameters (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021). Therefore, beyond its direct effect on podocyte inflammasome activity, oridonin may exert broader renoprotective actions by dampening inflammatory cascades that contribute to interstitial fibrosis and progressive renal insufficiency. In this context, oridonin’s oral bioavailability and established history in traditional medicine support the feasibility of translating these preclinical findings into clinical benefit for CKD patients (Su et al., 2024).\n\nIt is important to note that while direct evidence of oridonin’s effects on human podocytes remains to be fully elucidated, the expression of NLRP3 in podocytes has been demonstrated in experimental models of CKD. Additionally, studies involving natural products that inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome—such as fucoidan in diabetic kidney disease—have provided supportive mechanistic insights, suggesting that the targeting of inflammasome activation in podocytes is a viable therapeutic strategy (Wang et al., 2022).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nOverall, oridonin emerges as a compelling therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease, given its well-documented mechanism of inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome and its extensive background in modulating inflammatory pathways. Its natural origin and historical use in traditional Chinese medicine provide a robust basis for its safety profile, and preclinical studies have demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, including models of colitis, gout, and even acute kidney injury (Ding et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2021). Strengths of oridonin include its specificity for NLRP3 via covalent binding to a critical cysteine residue, which has been shown to yield nanomolar potency in relevant assays (He et al., 2018). Additionally, oridonin’s ability to modulate secondary pathways (NF-κB, p38-MAPK, and Nrf2) may amplify its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective benefits, addressing multiple facets of CKD pathophysiology ranging from podocyte loss to interstitial fibrosis (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nHowever, several weaknesses must also be considered. Despite promising preclinical data in other disease models, direct evidence for oridonin’s efficacy in modulating NLRP3 activation specifically in podocytes remains limited. Most mechanistic studies have been conducted in macrophages or other cell types, and while the extrapolation is reasonable given the conserved nature of inflammasome signaling, dedicated studies using human podocytes are needed to substantiate the proposed protective effects on proteinuria and interstitial fibrosis (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Furthermore, issues such as moderate potency, limited solubility, and variable bioavailability have been noted with oridonin, necessitating further formulation and structural optimization to ensure therapeutic efficacy in a clinical setting (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). These pharmacokinetic considerations are particularly critical for a chronic indication like CKD, where long-term dosing and sustained target engagement are required.\n\nAnother consideration is the translation of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects observed in acute injury models or non-renal tissue into the context of chronic kidney disease, which involves complex and multifactorial pathophysiology. Although the suppression of inflammasome-driven pyroptosis is a promising target for preventing podocyte injury, CKD progression involves additional factors such as hemodynamic stress, metabolic derangements, and immune dysregulation that may not be fully addressed by NLRP3 inhibition alone (Huang et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2020). Consequently, while the mechanistic specificity of oridonin is appealing, its efficacy in a multifaceted chronic disease state like CKD requires rigorous preclinical validation followed by carefully designed clinical trials.\n\nIn summary, oridonin holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease based on its robust anti-inflammatory mechanism, particularly its ability to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome via covalent binding to cysteine 279. The compound’s multifaceted mechanism—encompassing inhibition of caspase-1 activation, IL-1β maturation, and subsequent pyroptosis—could translate into preservation of podocyte integrity, reduction in proteinuria, and attenuation of interstitial fibrosis, all of which are critical endpoints in CKD management (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Nonetheless, challenges related to drug solubility, bioavailability, and the direct demonstration of efficacy in podocytes must be addressed. Given its strong preclinical validation in other inflammatory conditions, further targeted studies focusing on its renal effects and optimization of drug-like properties are warranted before it can be advanced as a viable treatment for CKD (Tan et al., 2021; Su et al., 2024). Overall, while there is a clear mechanistic rationale supporting the therapeutic potential of oridonin in CKD, additional studies specifically assessing its effects in relevant renal cell types and chronic disease models will be critical to fully validate its clinical utility.\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

BBG is part of the broad class of blue dyes that have been extensively studied for their ability to interact with the purinergic receptor family, most notably acting as a non‐competitive antagonist of the P2X7 receptor. The compound’s chemical structure confers high water solubility and the ability to be administered at defined doses with a favorable safety profile, as demonstrated by its routine use in ophthalmic surgery and CNS studies without systemic toxicity. In its role as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, BBG has been used in various preclinical studies investigating inflammatory and cell death pathways. Its synthetic origin and established manufacturing process, as offered by suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #B0770), support its scalability for repurposing in chronic diseases. BBG belongs to a class of small molecules that modulate ion channel function, particularly by binding to the ATP‐activated P2X7 receptor, which has been implicated in various inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. This class of compounds has been employed not only for their staining properties but also for their ability to interfere with cellular signaling events related to inflammation, rendering them of considerable interest in conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD) where inflammation and fibrosis are critical pathogenic factors (Ferreira et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nHistorically, Brilliant Blue G has been most widely recognized as a histological staining agent with established safety in both preclinical and clinical contexts, particularly within the neuroprotective field. Its pharmacological actions extend to antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, and preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in animal models of inflammatory diseases, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and various neurodegenerative conditions. More recently, BBG has been evaluated in rodent models of kidney disease. For example, in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) models—a widely used experimental model that mimics tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis—BBG treatment has been observed to reduce inflammation, diminish interstitial fibrosis, and promote tubular cell regeneration (Pereira et al., 2020). In rodent hypertensive nephropathy models, BBG has also been reported to modulate renal vascular resistance and alter tubular injury markers, suggesting that its renoprotective effects might extend to a broader spectrum of CKD–related pathologies. Although clinical trials directly targeting chronic kidney disease with BBG have not yet been detailed in the public literature, searches in ClinicalTrials.gov using terms related to “Brilliant Blue G OR P2X7 antagonist OR P2X7 inhibitor OR NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have identified several ongoing studies investigating similar P2X7 blockade strategies in CKD, which support the translational potential of this approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Prior investigations in animal models of lupus nephritis and hypertensive kidney disease have indicated that BBG’s anti‐inflammatory profile, including decreased IL-1β levels and reduced macrophage infiltration, is conducive to preventing progressive renal damage (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020). Veterinary and preclinical applications in models of inflammatory injury provide a solid foundation for repurposing BBG as a potential therapeutic candidate in conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, such as CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe mechanism by which BBG is hypothesized to exert its renoprotective effects in CKD is centered on its ability to non‐competitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor present on both renal immune and epithelial cells. The P2X7 receptor is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated cation channel that is activated under pathophysiological conditions where extracellular ATP levels are elevated, which frequently occurs during tissue injury and inflammation. Once activated, the P2X7 receptor facilitates the formation of pores in the plasma membrane that allow for the influx of cations and the efflux of cellular contents, thereby precipitating a cascade of intracellular events. One critical downstream consequence of P2X7 activation is the priming and subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that, upon activation, recruits the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and pro-caspase-1. This assembly leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase-1, which in turn processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, resulting in their secretion and the amplification of the inflammatory response. Moreover, P2X7 activation can induce pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that further exacerbates tissue injury and inflammation (Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nBBG exerts its effects via a noncompetitive blockade of the P2X7 receptor. In doing so, BBG prevents ATP-induced ion channel opening, thereby blocking the subsequent calcium influx and pore formation that are necessary for downstream inflammasome priming. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that BBG inhibits P2X7 receptor-mediated responses, including the calcium influx and the release of IL-1β from macrophages and other immune cells. In vitro studies with BBG have revealed nanomolar potency in blocking P2X7-mediated activities, which is reflective of its efficacy in dampening the inflammasome-related cytokine cascades (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019). Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that BBG may also interfere with pannexin-1 channels that are thought to facilitate ATP release and further promote inflammasome activation, although the precise relationship between pannexin-1 and P2X7 remains the subject of active research (Ferreira et al., 2016). Consequently, by inhibiting the P2X7 receptor, BBG blocks the ATP-driven initiation of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade. This blockade limits caspase-1 activation and the subsequent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, ultimately reducing local inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrotic remodeling within the renal parenchyma. Evidence from animal models indicates that such inhibition leads to reduced macrophage infiltration, decreased fibrogenic markers, and enhanced tubular cell regeneration, which collectively preserve the integrity of the tubulointerstitial architecture (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the established mechanistic pathway, BBG is expected to exert multifaceted renoprotective effects when applied to models of chronic kidney disease. In the proposed assay evaluating drug effects on renal cells, the expected outcome would involve a significant reduction in ATP-induced inflammasome activation. Specifically, by antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, BBG should lower the levels of active caspase-1, thereby reducing the maturation and extracellular release of IL-1β. This attenuation of inflammasome activation is expected to diminish pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells and mitigate pro-inflammatory cytokine release from resident macrophages. BBG’s inhibition of these pathways would theoretically preserve tubular architecture and limit interstitial fibrosis—a hallmark of progressive CKD. The renoprotective effect is anticipated to be observed as decreased expression of fibrosis markers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and heat shock protein-47 (HSP47), as well as reduced collagen deposition, as evidenced in rodent models of UUO and hypertensive nephropathy (Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nAt the molecular level, renal epithelial cells, particularly proximal tubular cells, express both P2X7 receptors and components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Immunohistochemical studies in animal models have demonstrated that under pathological conditions, P2X7 receptor expression is upregulated in tubular epithelial cells and can lead to enhanced production of IL-1β when activated by extracellular ATP (Arulkumaran, 2016; Howarth, 2020). Therefore, BBG is expected to be especially effective in cell types that are critical in the development of inflammation and fibrosis in CKD. By reducing the number of inflammatory cells (such as CD68-positive macrophages) infiltrating the renal parenchyma and by limiting cell death via pyroptosis, BBG may also indirectly reduce the fibrotic signaling that is mediated by cytokines such as TGF-β. This dual effect—both direct inhibition of inflammatory signaling and preservation of renal cell integrity—provides a compelling rationale for BBG’s use in preventing the progression of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nMoreover, BBG’s known safety profile in central nervous system studies and its extensive use as a surgical dye underscore its translational potential. Its water solubility and known pharmacokinetics facilitate dosing strategies that could be adapted for chronic administration in CKD patients. Additionally, the indirect suppression of inflammasome activation through P2X7 antagonism presents a novel approach to modulating the inflammatory microenvironment in the kidney, one that targets a critical nexus of inflammation and fibrosis (Ferreira et al., 2016; Mulay, 2019).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nIn summary, BBG presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on its ability to noncompetitively antagonize the P2X7 receptor, thereby blocking ATP-induced inflammasome priming and activation. The strengths of BBG include its well-established safety profile, water solubility, and proven efficacy in various rodent models of kidney injury such as hypertensive nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction. Preclinical data indicate that BBG can reduce key mediators of inflammation such as IL-1β, lower caspase-1 activation, and mitigate the deleterious effects of pyroptosis on renal tubular architecture, all of which are central to the pathophysiology of CKD (Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nHowever, several challenges remain that warrant further investigation. There is limited direct clinical data specifically evaluating BBG in human CKD patients, although the identification of related clinical trials targeting P2X7 and NLRP3 receptors in CKD suggests active interest in this therapeutic approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while BBG’s mechanism of action is well supported by in vitro and animal studies, the potential for differential effects based on receptor splice variants and cell type specificity in renal tissue must be carefully delineated. For instance, recent studies indicate that variations in P2X7 receptor expression and function in the renal vasculature may impact not only inflammatory signaling but also vascular tone, which could influence overall renal perfusion and function (Howarth, 2020).\n\nMoreover, while BBG’s indirect inhibition of the inflammasome pathway via P2X7 antagonism is mechanistically attractive, redundancy in inflammasome activation pathways—such as those that are P2X7-independent—might limit the overall efficacy of BBG as a monotherapy. Some studies have demonstrated that even with effective P2X7 inhibition, alternative pathways may still sustain IL-1β release under inflammatory conditions (Arulkumaran, 2016; Prendecki et al., 2022). Therefore, combination therapies that target multiple nodes in the inflammasome network may ultimately be required to achieve robust clinical benefit.\n\nIn terms of drug development strategies, BBG benefits from its established manufacturing and dosing data, which accelerates early phase clinical trial design and regulatory considerations. In addition, BBG has been successfully used in non-renal contexts—including long-term treatments in models of graft-versus-host disease—without significant toxicity, lending further support to its translational potential (Geraghty et al., 2019). The extensive literature on BBG’s anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in preclinical models provides a solid rationale for advancing this candidate for CKD even as further mechanistic and pharmacodynamic studies are conducted.\n\nWeaknesses of this candidate include the fact that while much of the preclinical data is encouraging, there is still a need for robust clinical trials that specifically assess BBG in CKD. Additionally, given the complexity of CKD pathogenesis—which involves multiple overlapping inflammatory and fibrotic signaling mechanisms—it will be important to determine whether BBG alone can induce sufficient therapeutic benefit or whether it is best applied as part of a combination regimen. Moreover, the potential vascular effects of P2X7 antagonism require further clarification to ensure that systemic hemodynamics are not adversely affected, particularly in patients with existing cardiovascular complications that often accompany CKD (Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall, the mechanistic rationale for BBG centers on its ability to interfere with a critical inflammatory pathway—namely, the ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. This blockade not only reduces the activation of caspase-1 and the release of IL-1β but also limits pyroptotic cell death, preservation of tubular architecture, and ultimately, fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. These effects address key pathogenic mechanisms underlying CKD progression. Moreover, aspects such as its water solubility, known dosing regimens from CNS and surgical applications, and favorable preclinical safety record render BBG an attractive candidate for fast-tracked repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Ferreira et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2020).\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence reviewed indicates that Brilliant Blue G holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. Its mechanism—centered on noncompetitive antagonism of the P2X7 receptor and consequent suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome cascade—offers a novel approach to preserving renal function by reducing inflammatory injury and fibrosis. While further research, particularly targeted clinical trials in the CKD patient population, is necessary to fully validate its efficacy and safety in this context, the preclinical data and extensive understanding of its molecular interactions support the continued development of BBG for CKD therapy (Mulay, 2019; Pereira et al., 2020; Arulkumaran, 2016).\n\nReferences  \nArulkumaran, N.

Chemically, CY-09 belongs to the class of thiazolidinone derivatives, a category known for its capacity to interfere with enzymatic activities via covalent or non-covalent interactions. Its development was driven by the need to specifically target the ATP-binding site within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, particularly focusing on the Walker A motif—a conserved nucleotide-binding region that is essential for the ATPase activity required for NLRP3 oligomerization. The design rationale behind CY-09 was based on structure-based drug design principles, where the compound was engineered to directly bind NLRP3, thereby preventing the conformational changes necessary for inflammasome assembly. This chemical class has previously been used in various contexts to modulate protein–enzyme interactions, and its application in inflammasome biology represents an evolution of this approach to target excessive inflammation mediated by the innate immune system (Jiang et al., 2017; Bertinaria et al., 2019).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of CY-09 is rooted in preclinical studies where it has been extensively characterized in vitro and in animal models of inflammatory diseases. Initially, CY-09 demonstrated potent inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in murine bone marrow–derived macrophages stimulated with canonical activators such as ATP, nigericin, and monosodium urate crystals, showing a dose-dependent reduction in IL-1β secretion and caspase-1 activation. Its efficacy has been documented in rodent models of sepsis and colitis, as well as in metabolic disorder models where NLRP3-driven inflammation is a core pathological feature. Although no clinical trials having been completed in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) specifically have been reported to date, the compound’s inclusion in multiple clinical trial searches (ClinicalTrials.gov) indicates that there is active interest in repurposing or further evaluating NLRP3 inhibitors like CY-09 in kidney-related conditions. Furthermore, the extensive body of work demonstrating that NLRP3 knockout or pharmacological inhibition confers protection against renal fibrosis, tubular inflammation, and other hallmarks of CKD (Mulay, 2019; Zhou & Li, 2023) supports the translational potential of a molecule such as CY-09. Historically, similar NLRP3 inhibitors (for example, MCC950) have been applied in various preclinical models of inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and their protective effects in conditions like diabetic nephropathy and ischemia-reperfusion injury provide a strong rationale for applying CY-09 in CKD (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nCY-09 exerts its therapeutic action by directly binding to the NLRP3 protein at its NACHT domain, specifically targeting the Walker A (or P-loop) motif responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis. This binding event competitively inhibits ATP from accessing the site, thereby blocking the ATPase activity essential for NLRP3 oligomerization. Without ATP hydrolysis, NLRP3 is unable to undergo the conformational rearrangements necessary for the aggregation of multiple NLRP3 molecules into the inflammasome complex. Consequently, the formation of the adaptor protein ASC specks is prevented, leading to a blockade of pro-caspase-1 activation and subsequent cleavage into its active form. This chain of events ultimately results in a reduction of the maturation and secretion of the central proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and it halts gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis—a form of lytic, inflammatory cell death that substantially contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis in CKD. Importantly, studies have demonstrated that CY-09 does not interfere with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, underscoring its molecular specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2019). The molecular interaction of CY-09 is supported by biotinylated pull-down assays which confirm its selective binding to NLRP3 over other inflammasome components, and computational docking models corroborate a binding mode that is competitive with ATP at the Walker A motif (Jiang et al., 2017; Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017). This detailed molecular mechanism signifies that CY-09 operates at an early and critical step in the inflammasome pathway, making it a highly attractive candidate for diseases with a significant inflammatory component, such as CKD (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nThe proposed hypothesis for applying CY-09 to CKD is that by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in human proximal tubular epithelial cells, the compound will inhibit ATPase-driven oligomerization of NLRP3, thereby reducing the formation of ASC specks, the activation of caspase-1, and the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. The downstream effect of blocking these events is the inhibition of gasdermin D–mediated pyroptosis, which is known to drive tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrotic remodeling—a central hallmark in the progression of CKD. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, NLRP3 is expressed and activated in response to various stress stimuli, including oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and metabolic dysregulation, all of which are common in CKD pathogenesis. By impeding this pathway, CY-09 is expected to diminish inflammatory cytokine secretion and reduce cell death, thereby preserving tubular integrity, minimizing interstitial inflammation, and preventing the fibrotic changes that culminate in renal function decline (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Data from preclinical models of kidney injury, such as those using MCC950 and other NLRP3 knockout models, have consistently shown improvements in renal structure and function, and reduction in profibrotic markers upon inhibition of the NLRP3 pathway (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017). Furthermore, oral bioavailability and a favorable safety profile in rodent studies enhance the clinical feasibility of CY-09 as a repurposed agent for CKD (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The expected effects in a CKD model would therefore include reduced extracellular matrix deposition, lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the renal interstitium, and overall attenuation of the fibrotic process, translating ultimately into stabilization of renal function (Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nBased on the comprehensive literature review, CY-09 emerges as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease. One of its greatest strengths lies in its robust and specific mechanism of action; by directly binding to the Walker A motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3, CY-09 efficiently prevents the initial ATP-driven steps that are critical for inflammasome assembly. This targeted inhibition ensures that downstream activation events—namely ASC speck formation, caspase-1 activation, and subsequent IL-1β/IL-18 maturation—are effectively suppressed. Such specificity is critical for minimizing off-target effects, as CY-09 has shown no significant interference with upstream NF-κB signaling or other pattern recognition receptors, which could reduce undesirable immunosuppressive side effects (Jiang et al., 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). The repurposing strategy is further supported by extensive preclinical evidence indicating that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 results in marked protection against renal fibrosis and inflammation in various CKD models. The preclinical efficacy of similar NLRP3 inhibitors such as MCC950 in models of diabetic nephropathy, cisplatin-induced renal injury, and ischemia-reperfusion injury reinforces the therapeutic potential of targeting NLRP3 in kidney disease (Mulay, 2019; Jiang et al., 2017).\n\nAnother significant strength of CY-09 is its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile in rodent studies, which is an important consideration for chronic administration required in CKD therapy (Lamkanfi & Dixit, 2017; Sandall et al., 2020). This pharmacokinetic profile, along with the compound’s high potency in inflammatory assays where nanomolar inhibitory effects have been observed, provides confidence that CY-09 could achieve therapeutically effective concentrations in the kidney without systemic toxicity.\n\nHowever, there are also challenges and uncertainties. Although extensive preclinical studies in inflammatory disease models support the potential of CY-09, direct evidence of its efficacy in chronic kidney disease models specifically remains limited. The majority of studies to date have focused on sepsis, metabolic disorders, and murine colitis rather than on kidney-specific outcomes. There is, therefore, a need for more targeted preclinical research in CKD models—including those mimicking diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and cisplatin-induced renal fibrosis—to definitively establish the renoprotective effects of CY-09 (Zhou & Li, 2023; Jiang et al., 2017). Additionally, while the mechanism is well-characterized in immune cells like macrophages, further studies need to elucidate its effects specifically in human proximal tubular epithelial cells and other renal cell types that contribute to CKD progression. Such studies should evaluate not only biochemical markers of inflammasome activation but also functional outcomes like proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate, and histological indices of fibrosis.\n\nAnother potential weakness concerns the translational gap between rodent models and human CKD. The pathophysiology of CKD is multifactorial, and while NLRP3-mediated inflammation is a key driver, the disease process involves many convergent signaling pathways including TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling and oxidative stress pathways. It is possible that the blockade of NLRP3 alone may not be sufficient to fully arrest disease progression in humans. In addition, although CY-09 appears selective based on current evidence, there is always the risk of off-target effects when a compound modulates ATPase activity, given the abundance of ATP-binding proteins in the cell. Careful profiling of CY-09 against a broad spectrum of other ATPases and kinases will be necessary to confirm its selectivity in a clinical setting (Sandall et al., 2020).\n\nIn summary, CY-09 represents an innovative and mechanistically compelling therapeutic candidate for Chronic Kidney Disease due to its direct inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a central mediator of renal inflammation and fibrosis. Its synthesis as a thiazolidinone derivative and its proven ability to bind the Walker A motif within the NACHT domain underscore its potential to precisely block inflammasome-driven pyroptosis. Preclinical evidence from models of various inflammatory conditions, along with robust biochemical data demonstrating nanomolar potency in macrophage assays, provides a strong rationale for its repurposing in kidney disease. Furthermore, its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable safety in rodent studies enhance its translational appeal. Nonetheless, additional research is needed to specifically validate its efficacy in CKD models, assess its long-term safety, and determine its pharmacodynamic effects in kidney-specific cell types such as proximal tubular epithelial cells. Overall, the strengths of CY-09’s targeted mechanism, coupled with supportive preclinical efficacy data from related inflammatory models, make it a promising candidate for further development and evaluation in Chronic Kidney Disease (ClinicalTrials.gov; Jiang et al., 2017; Zhou & Li, 2023).\n\nReferences  \nBertinaria, M., Gastaldi, S., Marini, E., & Giorgis, M.

"(Tranilast, 3)","(A-438079, 2)","Candidate 1 (A-438079, P2X7 antagonist) is supported by robust mechanistic data showing inhibition of ATP-driven NLRP3 inflammasome activation in acute kidney injury models (cisplatin, ischemia-reperfusion, sepsis), with high potency (IC50 ~40 nM) and good selectivity for P2X7. However, its relevance to chronic kidney disease remains indirect, as no dedicated CKD models or human safety data are provided, and some genetic knockout studies have failed to show benefit in hypertensive or chronic injury models. Clinical translation of P2X7 antagonists has also encountered mixed results in other inflammatory diseases. Candidate 2 (Tranilast) has an established clinical safety and tolerability profile from decades of use in allergic and fibrotic conditions, oral bioavailability, and dual mechanisms directly targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome (blocking NLRP3–ASC/NEK7 interactions) and TGF-β/PDGF fibrotic pathways. Preclinical data in diabetic nephropathy and UUO models show reductions in proteinuria, collagen deposition, and improved renal histology. Limited human observations in diabetic CKD add translational weight. While direct CKD trials are lacking, the specific, well-elucidated mechanisms, proven safety, and preliminary renal efficacy position Tranilast more favorably for rapid repurposing in CKD.","Tranilast is superior due to its dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic MoA directly relevant to CKD, demonstrated benefits in preclinical CKD models, and extensive human safety data enabling rapid translation.

The compound belongs to a class of agents that includes disubstituted tetrazoles and cyanoguanidine derivatives, which have been characterized by their ability to selectively block P2X7 receptor activation without significantly affecting other P2X subtypes. Its design and synthesis were initially achieved by pharmaceutical research groups (notably Abbott Laboratories as indicated in early publications) and have since been commercialized by companies such as Tocris (catalog #2947). This class of compounds was originally optimized for studies in inflammatory processes and pain models, as they inhibit ATP‐induced ion flux such as calcium influx and potassium efflux, a key factor in the activation cascade of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nBiochemically and pharmacologically, A-438079 has been investigated in various preclinical models for its ability to mitigate inflammation. It has demonstrated efficacy in rodent models of neuropathic pain and inflammatory conditions by inhibiting P2X7-mediated IL-1β release. In terms of renal applications, there is evidence from several studies that selective P2X7 antagonism can protect against kidney insults such as ischemia-reperfusion injury and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. For example, Zhang et al. (2014) showed that blocking P2X7 with antagonists like A-438079 attenuated cisplatin-induced renal tubular damage by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis markers in mice (Zhang et al., 2014). Additionally, studies such as those by Arulkumaran (2016) and colleagues have demonstrated that while genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of P2X7 in some models does not always equate to improved renal function, the block of P2X7-related signaling reduces inflammasome activation and cytokine release in immune cells and tubular epithelium (Arulkumaran, 2016; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Even though A-438079 has not been widely tested clinically for chronic kidney disease (CKD), its pharmacological profile as a P2X7 antagonist has been well characterized in biochemical studies and preclinical kidney injury models. This builds an indirect but strong rationale for repurposing it in CKD contexts, where sustained inflammation and fibrosis are major pathogenic drivers (Birch et al., 2013; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe primary mechanism of A-438079 is its high-affinity, selective antagonism of the P2X7 receptor. The P2X7 receptor is unique among the P2X family in its requirement for high concentrations of ATP, which are typically achieved in pathological conditions involving cell injury and inflammation. Under normal conditions, extracellular ATP levels are low; however, during tissue damage, ATP is released into the extracellular space where it binds to and activates P2X7 receptors expressed on immune cells (especially macrophages) and renal tubular epithelial cells (Han et al., 2020; Howarth, 2020).  \n\nUpon binding of ATP to the receptor, P2X7 undergoes a conformational change that opens its ion channel, permitting the influx of calcium ions and the efflux of potassium ions. This potassium efflux is a critical upstream event that triggers the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex responsible for activating caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 then cleaves the precursors of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature, secreted forms. These cytokines play major roles in propagating inflammatory signals, inducing pyroptosis (a form of inflammatory cell death), and promoting fibrotic remodeling in affected tissues (Qian et al., 2021; Shokoples, 2022).\n\nA-438079 interacts with the P2X7 receptor by competitively inhibiting ATP binding, thereby preventing the channel’s conformational change and subsequent ion flux. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) is approximately 40 nM in rodent models, indicating high potency (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). By blocking this pathway, A-438079 inhibits downstream events including NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 cleavage, and the release of IL-1β, ultimately reducing inflammatory responses and preventing the activation of fibrotic signaling pathways in kidney tissue, particularly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells where P2X7 and NLRP3 are highly expressed (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the context of chronic kidney disease, the principal pathological mechanisms include persistent inflammation and fibrosis, processes that are significantly driven by inflammasome activation in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. The hypothesis postulates that A-438079 will block ATP-induced activation of the P2X7 receptor in these cell types. By doing so, it prevents the crucial potassium efflux that is necessary for the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The expected downstream effects include a reduction in caspase-1 activation, decreased cleavage of pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β, and ultimately lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This chain of events is anticipated to reduce pyroptosis and curb the progression of fibrosis within the kidney (Qian et al., 2021; Arulkumaran et al., 2018).\n\nRenal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells are known to express both the P2X7 receptor and NLRP3, as evidenced by various studies outlining their roles in mediating inflammation-driven fibrosis in CKD (Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020). In assays, it is expected that treatment with A-438079 would result in a measurable decrease in IL-1β release, reduced markers of inflammation such as caspase-1 activity, and potentially lower expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components. Furthermore, by blunting chronic inflammatory responses, A-438079 may help to preserve kidney structure and function, thereby slowing the progression of CKD. The compound’s favorable pharmacokinetic properties—particularly its demonstrated bioavailability and minimal off-target effects—support the feasibility of achieving these outcomes (Burnstock, 2017).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nA-438079 presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of chronic kidney disease based on several factors. One of its major strengths lies in its selectivity and potency as a P2X7 receptor antagonist, which allows it to precisely target an upstream event in the inflammatory cascade that is centrally implicated in CKD. The ability of A-438079 to block ATP-induced ion flux is particularly compelling because it interrupts the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a known driver of IL-1β and IL-18 release in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells (Arulkumaran, 2016; Qian et al., 2021). This molecular specificity holds promise for reducing inflammation and subsequent fibrotic formation in the kidney, both of which are critical elements in CKD progression.\n\nThe preclinical evidence supporting the use of P2X7 antagonists in models of acute kidney injury, such as cisplatin nephrotoxicity and sepsis-induced renal injury, provides additional rationale, even though such models are not perfect surrogates for CKD (Zhang et al., 2014; Arulkumaran et al., 2018). Some studies have demonstrated that selective P2X7 blockade can attenuate inflammatory cytokine production, improve renal function markers, and reduce cell death, thereby supporting the hypothesis that similar benefits could be realized in chronic inflammatory settings like CKD (Deplano, 2012; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nAdditionally, the mechanistic details of P2X7 receptor signaling – requiring high extracellular ATP concentrations, initiating K+ efflux, and triggering inflammasome assembly – align closely with the known processes of renal inflammation and fibrosis. The fact that P2X7 and NLRP3 are co-expressed in key renal cell populations reinforces the logic behind using A-438079 to target these pathways (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013).\n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses and potential challenges that need to be considered. Firstly, in some preclinical models, especially in certain rat strains (as noted by studies involving P2X7 receptor knockout rats), the inhibition or deletion of P2X7 did not significantly alter renal function or prevent kidney injury induced by hypertensive factors such as angiotensin II (Nespoux et al., 2024). This suggests that compensatory pathways may exist, and the role of P2X7 might be context-dependent or vary among species. Secondly, clinical trials of P2X7 antagonists in other inflammatory diseases have had mixed outcomes, raising concerns about translational efficacy in human CKD (Luz et al., 2019). Moreover, while the mechanism of inflammasome inhibition is well understood in vitro, the in vivo pharmacodynamics in the kidney may be complicated by variable local ATP concentrations and the dynamic expression of the receptor in disease states.\n\nFrom a drug development standpoint, the potency (IC50 ~40 nM) and reported good bioavailability of A-438079 are advantageous. Its minimal off-target effects also reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions in clinical translation. However, more robust and specific data in CKD models are necessary to establish whether the attenuation of IL-1β release can consistently translate into meaningful improvements in renal fibrosis and overall kidney function over long-term treatment courses (Chen et al., 2018; Mishra et al., 2024).\n\nIn summary, A-438079’s targeted inhibition of the P2X7 receptor offers a novel approach to halt the ATP-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby mitigating a key upstream trigger of inflammatory cascades in CKD. Its preclinical track record in inflammatory and renal injury models, combined with its mechanistic specificity, positions it as a strong candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease. Nonetheless, species variability, redundant inflammatory pathways, and the need for further in vivo validation in models of long-term kidney disease remain potential hurdles. If these challenges are addressed in further preclinical and early clinical studies, A-438079 could represent a significant advance in targeting the inflammation-fibrosis axis in CKD (Arulkumaran et al., 2018; Fantauzzi, 2013; Howarth, 2020).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe strengths of A-438079 for CKD include its high potency, selectivity, and well-elucidated mechanism of action in blocking ATP-induced P2X7 receptor activation—a critical initiator of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in renal macrophages and tubular epithelial cells. These molecular interactions have been robustly characterized in multiple preclinical studies, indicating that the drug may effectively reduce IL-1β-mediated inflammation and subsequent fibrotic responses. In models of acute renal injury, antagonizing P2X7 has led to reduced cell death and improved renal function, which supports its potential usage in CKD where chronic inflammation is a driver of progressive fibrosis. Moreover, the chemical class to which A-438079 belongs has been extensively employed in studies of inflammatory diseases, reinforcing the feasibility of this approach (Deplano, 2012; Qian et al., 2021).\n\nConversely, potential weaknesses lie in the heterogeneity of experimental outcomes across different preclinical models and species. Some studies have shown that genetic deletion of P2X7 in rats does not always confer renal protection in induced kidney injury, suggesting that the pathophysiology in certain species—or even specific CKD etiologies—may be driven by redundant pathways beyond P2X7/NLRP3. In addition, although A-438079 demonstrates promising in vitro efficacy, there remains a critical need for long-term in vivo studies specifically in CKD models to verify that its anti-inflammatory effects translate into clinically meaningful outcomes in terms of preservation of renal function and reduction in fibrosis. Lastly, it is important to consider potential compensatory mechanisms in chronic inflammation that may limit the sole efficacy of P2X7 inhibition (Nespoux et al., 2024; Luz et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, A-438079 is a scientifically compelling therapeutic candidate for CKD, with robust mechanistic support and significant preclinical evidence in inflammatory models. Its ability to target the P2X7/NLRP3 axis addresses a novel therapeutic area in CKD by potentially halting the progression of inflammation-driven fibrosis. However, potential limitations due to species-specific responses and redundancy in inflammatory signaling must be carefully evaluated in future studies. Overall, A-438079 merits further investigation as part of a multi-pronged approach to modulate inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in chronic kidney disease (Arulkumaran, 2016; Fantauzzi, 2013; Han et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:  \nArulkumaran, N.

Chemically, it is an anthranilic acid derivative, specifically N-[3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl]-anthranilic acid, synthesized initially to treat allergic conditions such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and cutaneous disorders, including keloids and hypertrophic scars (Gilbert et al., 2012). The compound belongs to a class of agents that modulate inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways. The early synthesis of tranilast involved modifying the cinnamoyl anthranilate moiety to enhance potency against pro-fibrotic mediators like transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) while maintaining an acceptable toxicity profile. Over time, the compound’s anti-allergic properties were expanded by preclinical findings that demonstrated its potential to inhibit fibrotic changes via modulation of cytokine signaling and cellular proliferation pathways. This class of anthranilic acid derivatives has been used both in dermatologic and immunologic contexts, providing a background of clinical utility and safety that benefits the repurposing efforts for conditions such as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nTranilast has a well-documented history in clinical settings as an anti-allergic drug since its introduction in Japan decades ago. Its traditional indications have included treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and prevention of keloid formation. More recently, emerging preclinical studies have evaluated tranilast for its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in multiple organ systems. Notably, in experimental animal models of renal disease, tranilast has been investigated in contexts such as diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In these models, tranilast demonstrated the ability to reduce proteinuria, improve kidney structural integrity, and diminish collagen deposition (Gilbert et al., 2012). For instance, in diabetic nephropathy studies, tranilast reduced albuminuria and slowed the decline in glomerular filtration rate through attenuation of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix accumulation. Additionally, human studies in early-stage CKD patients, particularly those with diabetic nephropathy, receiving tranilast combined with standard therapies such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs have shown reductions in urinary markers like collagen type IV and albumin excretion (Gilbert et al., 2012). Beyond renal applications, the compound’s repurposing has been explored in cardiovascular contexts and even in certain inflammatory conditions driven by aberrant inflammasome activation, suggesting a versatility that supports further investigation into its utility against CKD. However, review of ClinicalTrials.gov did not reveal any registered trials directly assessing tranilast in CKD or related renal fibrosis, indicating that while preclinical and limited clinical observations are encouraging, robust clinical evaluation in CKD remains to be undertaken (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe hypothesized mechanism for tranilast in CKD centers on its ability to inhibit key inflammatory and fibrotic processes via direct intervention in inflammasome biology. Tranilast’s molecular target is the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex that plays a pivotal role in innate inflammatory responses. The assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires a coordinated interaction among NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and the serine/threonine kinase NEK7. Activation of this complex ultimately leads to the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form, which subsequently processes pro-IL-1β into IL-1β, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that drives pyroptosis and contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Specifically, tranilast is proposed to disrupt the critical interactions between NLRP3 and ASC as well as between NLRP3 and NEK7. This disruption is believed to occur via direct binding to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3, which is essential for its oligomerization and subsequent recruitment of ASC. By preventing ASC oligomerization, tranilast effectively halts the assembly of the inflammasome, thereby blocking caspase-1 activation and reducing IL-1β secretion (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).\n\nIn addition to inflammasome disruption, tranilast has been shown to attenuate TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling—another major contributor to kidney disease progression. TGF-β is well documented as a central mediator of extracellular matrix synthesis and fibroblast activation, and its overexpression in chronic kidney injury drives interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. Tranilast’s inhibition of TGF-β signaling includes the suppression of Smad2 phosphorylation and downstream fibrotic responses, leading to reductions in collagen deposition and interstitial matrix accumulation (Gilbert et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2019). Furthermore, tranilast’s capacity to inhibit PDGF signaling reduces mesangial cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in the renal glomerulus, providing an additional mechanistic avenue through which it exerts its renoprotective effects (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the proposed mechanism, the expected effect of tranilast in a CKD context is to attenuate tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis by mitigating both inflammatory and fibrotic signaling. In tubular epithelial cells (TECs), oxidative stress triggers activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in IL-1β secretion and pyroptotic cell death—a process that not only damages the epithelial barrier but also leads to further recruitment of inflammatory cells. By interfering with the NLRP3–ASC and NLRP3–NEK7 interactions, tranilast is anticipated to reduce caspase-1 activation. Consequently, a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis is expected, which would alleviate tubular inflammation under conditions of oxidative stress (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).\n\nFurthermore, the reduction in IL-1β and subsequent dampening of the inflammatory cascade should also lead to a decrease in TGF-β release. TGF-β is critically involved in driving fibroblast activation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. Thus, by curtailing the initial inflammasome-mediated inflammatory trigger, tranilast indirectly reduces TGF-β levels, thereby preventing its downstream pro-fibrotic effects. This is particularly relevant in diabetic nephropathy and UUO models, where TGF-β-mediated fibrosis is a major determinant of disease progression (Chen et al., 2020; Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nIn summary, the expected outcome in an in vitro or in vivo CKD assay would be a demonstrable decrease in markers of inflammation (such as IL-1β levels), reduced caspase-1 activity, diminished pyroptosis (as measured by LDH release or similar assays), and lowered expression of fibrotic markers including collagen, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Moreover, the preservation of tubular epithelial cell integrity and a consequent improvement in overall kidney function would provide functional support for tranilast’s therapeutic efficacy in CKD (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nTranilast represents a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease based on its dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. From a mechanistic standpoint, its ability to selectively disrupt the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting key protein–protein interactions (specifically between NLRP3, ASC, and NEK7) underpins its potential to reduce caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. This targeted mechanism is particularly attractive because it distinguishes tranilast from broader-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs that may have off-target effects. Moreover, by concurrently attenuating TGF-β signaling pathways, tranilast can reduce fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition—both critical contributors to the progression of CKD (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019).\n\nA major strength of tranilast is its established clinical use as an anti-allergic agent over several decades, which provides a substantial record of safety and tolerability in humans. Its oral dosing regimen further facilitates rapid clinical repurposing for CKD. Preclinical studies in animal models of diabetic nephropathy and UUO have demonstrated measurable benefits, such as reduced proteinuria and improved renal histology, lending support to its potential efficacy in human CKD (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nHowever, there are certain weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Despite promising preclinical data, there is a noted absence of registered clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with tranilast (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), which indicates that further clinical validation is required. Moreover, while tranilast’s inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is supported by various mechanistic studies, the precise molecular details—such as confirmation of binding to the LRR domain of NLRP3 and the exact nature of its impact on NEK7 interactions—require further elucidation through biochemical and structural studies (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). In addition, as with any repurposed drug, careful evaluation of potential off-target immunomodulatory effects is necessary. There have been reports of immune-mediated adverse events in other clinical indications, which, although not prominent, must be monitored during chronic administration in CKD patients (Strilchuk et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, the body of preclinical literature strongly supports the hypothesis that tranilast can disrupt NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and attenuate subsequent inflammatory and fibrotic cascades in the kidney. Given its dual mechanism—inhibiting both inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion and TGF-β–mediated fibrosis—tranilast emerges as an attractive candidate for repurposing in CKD. Its established use in other indications and favorable oral bioavailability further underscore its potential for rapid clinical translation. Nonetheless, the lack of direct clinical trial evidence in renal disease and the need for further mechanistic clarification represent critical challenges that the research team must address in subsequent studies (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023). Overall, the strengths of mechanistic specificity and a well-established safety profile position tranilast as a promising drug candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease, warranting further investigation through comprehensive preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials.\n\nReferences  \nChen, S., Wang, Y., Pan, Y., Liu, Y., Zheng, S., Ding, K., Mu, K., Yuan, Y., Li, Z., Song, H., Jin, Y., & Fu, J.

"(Tranilast, 3)","(Disulfiram, 0)","Both candidates are repurposed small molecules with anti‐inflammatory profiles, but differ in the strength of CKD‐relevant evidence and mechanistic targeting. Disulfiram (ID:0) has a well‐characterized safety profile from decades of alcohol‐aversion use and a clear mechanism inhibiting gasdermin D (GSDMD) to block pyroptosis. Preclinical data in acute kidney injury (AKI) models demonstrate reduced caspase‐11–GSDMD activation and improved renal function. However, there are no published long‐term CKD or fibrosis models, and translation from acute injury to chronic disease remains to be validated. Disulfiram’s potential off‐target effects on general host defenses and unknown chronic dosing requirements pose additional risks. Tranilast (ID:3) also benefits from established human safety in allergic indications and oral bioavailability. It has direct preclinical efficacy in diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) models of renal fibrosis, including reductions in proteinuria, collagen deposition, and improved histology. Mechanistically, it disrupts NLRP3 inflammasome assembly at the NLRP3–ASC/NEK7 interfaces and concurrently inhibits TGF‐β/Smad signaling, addressing two central CKD drivers—sterile inflammation and fibrosis. Limited human data in early‐stage CKD diabetic nephropathy patients (with ACE inhibitors) show decreased urinary collagen IV and albumin excretion. While the precise structural binding to NLRP3 requires further validation, the dual MoA is highly relevant to CKD pathogenesis. No serious CKD‐specific safety signals have emerged, though chronic immunomodulation should be monitored. Overall, tranilast presents stronger direct CKD evidence, a dual upstream mechanism, and existing renal fibrosis data, whereas disulfiram’s data are promising but confined to acute injury and pyroptosis inhibition without chronic disease models.","Tranilast is favored over disulfiram because it combines established safety with direct preclinical and limited clinical CKD data, dual inhibition of inflammasome‐driven inflammation and TGF‐β–mediated fibrosis, and demonstrated efficacy in chronic nephropathy models. Disulfiram, despite a clear pyroptosis‐blocking MoA and compelling AKI results, lacks validation in chronic kidney disease models and carries risks of off‐target immune interference over prolonged administration.",41,"(0, 3)","{'hypothesis': 'Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nDisulfiram is a synthetic small‐molecule drug originally discovered more than seventy years ago and is well known for its unique chemical structure featuring a tetraethylthiuram disulfide core. It is typically synthesized via the oxidation of diethyldithiocarbamate salts derived from the reaction of carbon disulfide with diethylamine, producing a compound with a central disulfide bond that confers its thiol‐reactive properties (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13). Chemically, disulfiram belongs to the dithiocarbamate family and is classified pharmacologically as an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor. Historically, this inhibition of ALDH has been the molecular basis for its clinical application as an alcohol aversion agent, where disulfiram induces the accumulation of acetaldehyde following alcohol ingestion, causing an assortment of discomforting physiological effects such as flushing, nausea, and tachycardia (Lu et al., 2021, p. 12). More recently, however, disulfiram has assumed a new identity in drug repurposing initiatives; its ability to interact covalently with cysteine residues in target proteins – a consequence of its thiuram disulfide structure – has attracted considerable attention in the context of inflammatory diseases. In particular, its capacity to interfere with the function of gasdermin D (GSDMD) via covalent modification is emerging as a promising mechanism by which disulfiram could counteract pathological inflammatory pathways (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4). This newly recognized activity places disulfiram within a therapeutic class of established drugs that are being re‐evaluated beyond their original indications, seeking to exploit their long clinical history and known safety profiles for novel applications such as the modulation of pyroptosis in inflammatory pathologies like chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nDisulfiram has a long-established history, primarily being used in the management of chronic alcohol use disorder since its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the early 1950s. As a stand‐alone therapy, its effectiveness in producing a pronounced aversive reaction to ethanol intake has made it a mainstay in addiction medicine. Over the decades, disulfiram has been administered safely to vast numbers of patients – a fact that is of critical importance when considering repurposing efforts, as its pharmacokinetics, dosing parameters, and toxicity profiles are well documented (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3). In addition to its established role in alcohol abstinence, disulfiram has been repurposed for a number of other applications. Emerging investigations have highlighted its promising activity in malignancies, where disulfiram, often in conjunction with supplemental copper, has demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against cancer stem cells via mechanisms that involve proteasome inhibition and modulation of redox homeostasis (Lu et al., 2021, pp. 13–14; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). More recently, its anti-inflammatory potential has been explored in the context of infectious diseases and systemic inflammatory responses. For instance, disulfiram has been evaluated in sepsis models, where its inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis led to reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines and improved survival in animal models (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). In models of ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), disulfiram pretreatment was shown to ameliorate renal dysfunction and histological damage by suppressing the noncanonical caspase-11–GSDMD inflammatory axis (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6). Although direct clinical studies of disulfiram in chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis remain limited, the encouraging preclinical signals from acute kidney insults and its capacity to modulate cell death pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation suggest that disulfiram—and its metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate—might be effective in attenuating the injurious inflammatory cascades observed in CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, the repurposing hypothesis for disulfiram in chronic kidney disease centers on its recently identified inhibitory effect on gasdermin D (GSDMD), a pore-forming effector protein that is indispensable for the execution of pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory, lytic form of programmed cell death triggered by the activation of inflammasomes. When these multiprotein complexes form in response to pathogenic stimuli or sterile injury, they lead to the activation of inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1, and in noncanonical pathways, caspase-4/5/11. These enzymes cleave GSDMD to generate an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) that oligomerizes and inserts into the plasma membrane to form pores, thereby releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) into the extracellular milieu (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17). Disulfiram has been shown to block this crucial terminal step in pyroptosis by covalently modifying a conserved cysteine residue (Cys191 in human GSDMD and Cys192 in murine GSDMD) through a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. This chemical modification prevents the oligomerization and subsequent membrane pore formation by GSDMD, thereby directly inhibiting the execution phase of pyroptosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). Moreover, disulfiram’s activity is potentiated in the presence of copper ions, which may stabilize its reactive metabolites such as diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC), enhancing its inhibitory potency in cellular assays (Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18). The outcome of this inhibition is a significant reduction in the pyroptotic cell death cascade, as evidenced by decreased IL-1β release and overall attenuation of inflammatory signaling. In the context of the kidney, specifically within tubular epithelial cells (TECs), the inflammatory microenvironment driven by inflammasome activation is one of the critical factors in the progression from acute injury to chronic fibrosis. TECs are known to express inflammasome components and are susceptible to pyroptosis, which contributes to interstitial inflammation and fibrogenesis (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Therefore, by inhibiting the cleavage and activation of GSDMD in these cells, disulfiram has the potential to preserve tubular integrity and prevent the inflammatory cascade that ultimately drives chronic kidney injury.\n\nExpected Effect:  \nBased on the proposed hypothesis and data from related inflammatory and renal injury models, disulfiram is predicted to exert a protective effect in the setting of chronic kidney disease by targeting the final common pathway of pyroptotic cell death. In a typical in vitro assay using primary tubular epithelial cells or established TEC lines, treatment with disulfiram at concentrations within the non-cytotoxic range (e.g., 0.1–5 µM as indicated in hypoxia/reoxygenation models) is expected to prevent the formation of GSDMD pores, thereby reducing cell membrane disruption, limiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18), and preserving cell viability (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11). The expected molecular signature following disulfiram treatment would include decreased levels of cleaved (active) GSDMD, reduced caspase-11 activation along with lower concentrations of circulating cytokines, as well as preserved markers of epithelial cell integrity. Given that GSDMD and components of the inflammasome are expressed in tubular epithelial cells (as supported by studies focusing on renal inflammatory pathways; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 7–9; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 9–10), the inhibition of GSDMD pore formation directly addresses a mechanistic driver of tubular injury. This would translate into reduced interstitial inflammation and limited myofibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition, which are critical steps in the fibrotic process that underpins CKD progression (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Ultimately, the expectation is that a therapeutic regimen involving disulfiram may slow or even halt the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease by mitigating the damaging effects of pyroptosis.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nDisulfiram presents several attractive features as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. The strengths of disulfiram include:  \n1. A well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profile, supported by decades of clinical use in alcohol aversion therapy, which facilitates rapid translation into new clinical contexts (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Lu et al., 2021, p. 12).  \n2. A clear and innovative mechanism of action based on the inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis. This mechanism is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of CKD, where inflammasome activation and resultant pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells contribute to interstitial inflammation and fibrosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11).  \n3. The potential for its active metabolite, diethyldithiocarbamate, and the enhancing role of copper complexation to improve its potency as a pyroptosis inhibitor further bolster the therapeutic rationale (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18; Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34).  \n4. Preclinical evidence in models of acute kidney injury (ischemia-reperfusion injury) demonstrates that disulfiram can ameliorate renal dysfunction through inhibition of the caspase-11–GSDMD axis, suggesting that similar effects may be achieved in chronic inflammatory settings underlying CKD (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11).  \n\nHowever, there are also potential weaknesses and gaps that warrant further exploration:  \n1. Despite promising preclinical data in acute injury models and other inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, direct evidence of disulfiram’s efficacy in chronic kidney disease models remains limited. The available studies do not present long-term data specific to CKD or renal fibrosis, which is critical for validating its use in a chronic condition (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6).  \n2. While the mechanism of covalent modification of GSDMD at Cys191 is well supported by molecular studies, the extrapolation of these findings to tubular epithelial cells in the kidney (as opposed to macrophages or other inflammatory cells) requires additional confirmation. It is essential to verify that TECs exhibit similar susceptibility to the gasdermin D inhibitory effects of disulfiram under pathological conditions (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n3. Dosage optimization, chronic toxicity assessments, and potential off-target effects in the renal context have not yet been extensively characterized. Although the historical human use of disulfiram supports a favorable safety profile, the dosing regimen for CKD might differ from that used for alcohol aversion therapy, given the distinct pharmacodynamics required to inhibit pyroptosis in kidney tissues (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8).  \n4. Another consideration is the effect of systemic modulation of pyroptosis. Since pyroptosis is integral to effective immune responses under certain circumstances, indiscriminate long-term inhibition could potentially compromise host defenses against infections. This balance between therapeutic efficacy in CKD and preservation of necessary immune functions must be carefully evaluated in preclinical models and eventually in clinical trials (Hu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n\nIn summary, disulfiram emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease due to its novel mechanism of targeting gasdermin D-induced pyroptosis—a pathway that is increasingly recognized as a critical driver of renal inflammation and fibrogenesis. Its long clinical history, established oral bioavailability, and well-characterized safety profile offer substantial advantages that could accelerate its translation into CKD-focused studies. The evidence from acute kidney injury models and inflammatory disease research forms a strong mechanistic rationale for its use to preserve tubular epithelial integrity and mitigate interstitial inflammation. Nevertheless, further detailed studies are imperative to validate its effectiveness in chronic kidney models, delineate optimal dosing strategies, and ensure that the inhibition of pyroptosis does not adversely affect normal immune surveillance. Based on the data reviewed—from biochemical studies demonstrating covalent modification of GSDMD (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8) to preclinical studies in renal injury models (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6)—the overall evaluation supports continued investigation of disulfiram as a repurposed agent in CKD. Its potential to modulate a critical pathogenic pathway in chronic kidney injury could represent a novel therapeutic intervention that merits further preclinical and clinical development (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18).\n\nReferences  \nCai, Q., Sun, Z., Xu, S., Jiao, X., Guo, S., Li, Y., Wu, H., & Yu, X.

Chemically, it is an anthranilic acid derivative, specifically N-[3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl]-anthranilic acid, synthesized initially to treat allergic conditions such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and cutaneous disorders, including keloids and hypertrophic scars (Gilbert et al., 2012). The compound belongs to a class of agents that modulate inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways. The early synthesis of tranilast involved modifying the cinnamoyl anthranilate moiety to enhance potency against pro-fibrotic mediators like transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) while maintaining an acceptable toxicity profile. Over time, the compound’s anti-allergic properties were expanded by preclinical findings that demonstrated its potential to inhibit fibrotic changes via modulation of cytokine signaling and cellular proliferation pathways. This class of anthranilic acid derivatives has been used both in dermatologic and immunologic contexts, providing a background of clinical utility and safety that benefits the repurposing efforts for conditions such as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nTranilast has a well-documented history in clinical settings as an anti-allergic drug since its introduction in Japan decades ago. Its traditional indications have included treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and prevention of keloid formation. More recently, emerging preclinical studies have evaluated tranilast for its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in multiple organ systems. Notably, in experimental animal models of renal disease, tranilast has been investigated in contexts such as diabetic nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In these models, tranilast demonstrated the ability to reduce proteinuria, improve kidney structural integrity, and diminish collagen deposition (Gilbert et al., 2012). For instance, in diabetic nephropathy studies, tranilast reduced albuminuria and slowed the decline in glomerular filtration rate through attenuation of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix accumulation. Additionally, human studies in early-stage CKD patients, particularly those with diabetic nephropathy, receiving tranilast combined with standard therapies such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs have shown reductions in urinary markers like collagen type IV and albumin excretion (Gilbert et al., 2012). Beyond renal applications, the compound’s repurposing has been explored in cardiovascular contexts and even in certain inflammatory conditions driven by aberrant inflammasome activation, suggesting a versatility that supports further investigation into its utility against CKD. However, review of ClinicalTrials.gov did not reveal any registered trials directly assessing tranilast in CKD or related renal fibrosis, indicating that while preclinical and limited clinical observations are encouraging, robust clinical evaluation in CKD remains to be undertaken (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nThe hypothesized mechanism for tranilast in CKD centers on its ability to inhibit key inflammatory and fibrotic processes via direct intervention in inflammasome biology. Tranilast’s molecular target is the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex that plays a pivotal role in innate inflammatory responses. The assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires a coordinated interaction among NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and the serine/threonine kinase NEK7. Activation of this complex ultimately leads to the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form, which subsequently processes pro-IL-1β into IL-1β, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that drives pyroptosis and contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). Specifically, tranilast is proposed to disrupt the critical interactions between NLRP3 and ASC as well as between NLRP3 and NEK7. This disruption is believed to occur via direct binding to the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3, which is essential for its oligomerization and subsequent recruitment of ASC. By preventing ASC oligomerization, tranilast effectively halts the assembly of the inflammasome, thereby blocking caspase-1 activation and reducing IL-1β secretion (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).\n\nIn addition to inflammasome disruption, tranilast has been shown to attenuate TGF-β-mediated fibrotic signaling—another major contributor to kidney disease progression. TGF-β is well documented as a central mediator of extracellular matrix synthesis and fibroblast activation, and its overexpression in chronic kidney injury drives interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. Tranilast’s inhibition of TGF-β signaling includes the suppression of Smad2 phosphorylation and downstream fibrotic responses, leading to reductions in collagen deposition and interstitial matrix accumulation (Gilbert et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2019). Furthermore, tranilast’s capacity to inhibit PDGF signaling reduces mesangial cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in the renal glomerulus, providing an additional mechanistic avenue through which it exerts its renoprotective effects (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven the proposed mechanism, the expected effect of tranilast in a CKD context is to attenuate tubular injury and interstitial fibrosis by mitigating both inflammatory and fibrotic signaling. In tubular epithelial cells (TECs), oxidative stress triggers activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in IL-1β secretion and pyroptotic cell death—a process that not only damages the epithelial barrier but also leads to further recruitment of inflammatory cells. By interfering with the NLRP3–ASC and NLRP3–NEK7 interactions, tranilast is anticipated to reduce caspase-1 activation. Consequently, a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis is expected, which would alleviate tubular inflammation under conditions of oxidative stress (Kim et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).\n\nFurthermore, the reduction in IL-1β and subsequent dampening of the inflammatory cascade should also lead to a decrease in TGF-β release. TGF-β is critically involved in driving fibroblast activation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and fibrotic remodeling in the kidney. Thus, by curtailing the initial inflammasome-mediated inflammatory trigger, tranilast indirectly reduces TGF-β levels, thereby preventing its downstream pro-fibrotic effects. This is particularly relevant in diabetic nephropathy and UUO models, where TGF-β-mediated fibrosis is a major determinant of disease progression (Chen et al., 2020; Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nIn summary, the expected outcome in an in vitro or in vivo CKD assay would be a demonstrable decrease in markers of inflammation (such as IL-1β levels), reduced caspase-1 activity, diminished pyroptosis (as measured by LDH release or similar assays), and lowered expression of fibrotic markers including collagen, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Moreover, the preservation of tubular epithelial cell integrity and a consequent improvement in overall kidney function would provide functional support for tranilast’s therapeutic efficacy in CKD (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nTranilast represents a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease based on its dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. From a mechanistic standpoint, its ability to selectively disrupt the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting key protein–protein interactions (specifically between NLRP3, ASC, and NEK7) underpins its potential to reduce caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. This targeted mechanism is particularly attractive because it distinguishes tranilast from broader-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs that may have off-target effects. Moreover, by concurrently attenuating TGF-β signaling pathways, tranilast can reduce fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition—both critical contributors to the progression of CKD (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019).\n\nA major strength of tranilast is its established clinical use as an anti-allergic agent over several decades, which provides a substantial record of safety and tolerability in humans. Its oral dosing regimen further facilitates rapid clinical repurposing for CKD. Preclinical studies in animal models of diabetic nephropathy and UUO have demonstrated measurable benefits, such as reduced proteinuria and improved renal histology, lending support to its potential efficacy in human CKD (Gilbert et al., 2012).\n\nHowever, there are certain weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Despite promising preclinical data, there is a noted absence of registered clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with tranilast (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), which indicates that further clinical validation is required. Moreover, while tranilast’s inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is supported by various mechanistic studies, the precise molecular details—such as confirmation of binding to the LRR domain of NLRP3 and the exact nature of its impact on NEK7 interactions—require further elucidation through biochemical and structural studies (Huang et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019). In addition, as with any repurposed drug, careful evaluation of potential off-target immunomodulatory effects is necessary. There have been reports of immune-mediated adverse events in other clinical indications, which, although not prominent, must be monitored during chronic administration in CKD patients (Strilchuk et al., 2019).\n\nIn conclusion, the body of preclinical literature strongly supports the hypothesis that tranilast can disrupt NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and attenuate subsequent inflammatory and fibrotic cascades in the kidney. Given its dual mechanism—inhibiting both inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion and TGF-β–mediated fibrosis—tranilast emerges as an attractive candidate for repurposing in CKD. Its established use in other indications and favorable oral bioavailability further underscore its potential for rapid clinical translation. Nonetheless, the lack of direct clinical trial evidence in renal disease and the need for further mechanistic clarification represent critical challenges that the research team must address in subsequent studies (Saeedi-Boroujeni et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023). Overall, the strengths of mechanistic specificity and a well-established safety profile position tranilast as a promising drug candidate for the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease, warranting further investigation through comprehensive preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials.\n\nReferences  \nChen, S., Wang, Y., Pan, Y., Liu, Y., Zheng, S., Ding, K., Mu, K., Yuan, Y., Li, Z., Song, H., Jin, Y., & Fu, J.

"(Tranilast, 3)","(Oridonin, 6)","Both candidates target the NLRP3 inflammasome to mitigate inflammatory and fibrotic processes in CKD, but they differ significantly in evidence depth, translational readiness, and risk profile. Candidate 1, Tranilast (ID: 3), has an extensive clinical history as an anti-allergic agent with decades of human safety data, proven oral bioavailability, and repurposing rationale. Multiple preclinical CKD models (diabetic nephropathy, UUO) demonstrate reduced proteinuria, preserved histology, and lowered fibrosis markers. Early human data in diabetic nephropathy patients on ACEi/ARB show decreases in urinary collagen IV and albumin excretion. Its dual mechanism—direct inhibition of NLRP3–ASC/NEK7 interactions and suppression of TGF-β/Smad2 and PDGF signaling—addresses both upstream inflammation and downstream fibrogenesis. Candidate 2, Oridonin (ID: 6), is a natural diterpenoid with nanomolar covalent inhibition of NLRP3 via Cys279 in the NACHT domain and additional anti-inflammatory/antioxidant effects (NF-κB, p38-MAPK, Nrf2). Preclinical studies in macrophages, rodent diabetic nephropathy, and ischemia–reperfusion injury models show renoprotection, but no direct evidence exists in human podocytes or comprehensive CKD models. Oridonin faces formulation challenges (solubility, bioavailability) and limited chronic safety data in humans, raising questions about sustained target engagement. Although both compounds are orally bioavailable and exploit inflammasome blockade, Tranilast’s extensive CKD-relevant in vivo data, early clinical observations, established safety profile, and dual anti-fibrotic mechanism outweigh Oridonin’s potent but less‐validated inflammasome inhibition and development hurdles.","Tranilast (ID: 3) is the superior candidate because it has robust, CKD‐specific preclinical evidence, early human biomarker data, a well-characterized MoA addressing both inflammation and fibrosis, known oral PK, and decades of clinical safety in other indications, enabling rapid repurposing. In contrast, Oridonin (ID: 6), despite high in vitro potency against NLRP3 and pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects, lacks direct validation in renal cell types central to CKD, has unresolved bioavailability and formulation issues, and limited chronic human safety data. The sum of evidence, translational readiness, and risk profile strongly favor Tranilast for CKD therapy development.",42,"(3, 6)","{'hypothesis': 'Tranilast (MedChemExpress, catalog #HY-50819)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Tranilast (MedChemExpress, catalog #HY-50819)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nTranilast, commercially available from MedChemExpress (catalog #HY-50819), is a small-molecule synthetic compound originally developed as an anti-allergic agent.

As a kaurane-type diterpenoid, its structure comprises four isoprene units arranged into a characteristic tetracyclic skeleton, which is emblematic of this class of natural products. The compound’s discovery and development emerged from the long-standing tradition of using Rabdosia rubescens (also known as Donglingcao) in Asian folk medicine, where it was historically applied for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In the broader context of drug development, diterpenoids such as oridonin have been recognized for their “drug-like” properties; they have provided scaffolds for synthetic modifications aimed at improving potency, solubility, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Moreover, the extraction and study of oridonin reflect an important paradigm in natural products research, wherein historical use is validated and expanded upon with modern medicinal chemistry techniques. This compound, commercially available from suppliers like Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #O2015), fits well within the class of small-molecule natural products that have been repurposed for modern therapeutic applications in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases (Ding et al., 2016).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nOridonin’s use spans a broad spectrum of therapeutic applications. Traditionally, the herbal preparations containing oridonin were employed in Chinese medicine to alleviate conditions ranging from pharyngitis and gingivitis to various inflammatory and tumorous conditions. With the advent of modern biochemical and pharmacological research, oridonin has been extensively studied for its anticancer efficacy; many preclinical studies have demonstrated its capacity to induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and suppress metastasis in a variety of cancer cell lines (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). In addition to its anticancer properties, several studies have documented oridonin’s robust anti-inflammatory actions. Notably, oridonin has shown efficacy in experimental models of colitis and gout through its inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that mediates the maturation of IL-1β and is a critical driver of inflammatory responses (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020). Although most of the historical and ongoing research has emphasized oridonin’s anticancer and acute inflammatory indications, there is emerging interest in its potential role in renal pathologies. A search on ClinicalTrials.gov using terms such as “Oridonin AND kidney OR renal OR chronic kidney disease OR glomerulonephritis OR proteinuria OR glomerular” returned tens of thousands of trials, indicating significant research activity into natural products and potentially repurposed compounds for kidney diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, to date there is limited direct clinical evidence of oridonin being deployed specifically for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preclinical studies, particularly those involving rodent models of diabetic nephropathy and ischemia–reperfusion injury, have demonstrated renoprotective effects such as reduced inflammatory cytokine levels, diminished fibrosis markers, and improved renal function parameters; these effects suggest that oridonin or its derivatives might be promising candidates for treating CKD or similar renal conditions (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021).\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, oridonin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects primarily through selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex known to activate caspase-1 and mediate the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. Recent mechanistic studies have shown that oridonin covalently binds to cysteine 279 within the NACHT domain of NLRP3, a critical residue required for the ATPase activity of NLRP3 and its subsequent oligomerization (He et al., 2018). This binding effectively prevents the conformational changes necessary for the recruitment of NEK7, thereby halting inflammasome assembly and activation. In macrophages, this inhibition leads to a marked reduction in IL-1β secretion and attenuates inflammatory cell recruitment—a mechanism that has been validated through pull‐down assays and mass spectrometry, which demonstrated nanomolar potency of oridonin in suppressing NLRP3 activation (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020).\n\nBeyond its direct interaction with the NLRP3 inflammasome, oridonin has been shown to modulate additional signaling pathways. For example, it can inhibit NF-κB and p38-MAPK activation, further blunting the inflammatory response, and it has been implicated in the activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidative defenses at lower concentrations, contributing to its cytoprotective effects (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019). These multifaceted actions underscore the polypharmacological nature of oridonin: while its primary mode of action appears to involve covalent modification of NLRP3, its downstream effects extend into a broader anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative network. This convergence on inflammatory signaling pathways is particularly relevant because overactivation of the inflammasome and subsequent pyroptotic cell death are implicated not only in acute inflammatory diseases but also in chronic fibrotic processes within the kidney (Ding et al., 2020).\n\nExpanding the context to renal pathology, the hypothesis driving our proposal is that human podocytes—which are essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier—express components of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activation of NLRP3 in these cells has been linked to pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, which in turn contributes to podocyte loss, proteinuria, and interstitial fibrosis, all hallmarks of CKD. Although most direct evidence of oridonin’s NLRP3 inhibition comes from studies in immune cells like macrophages (He et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2016), the underlying mechanism is conserved across cell types. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that oridonin could similarly inhibit NLRP3 activation in podocytes, thereby preventing inflammasome assembly, blocking caspase-1 activation, and ultimately reducing the release of IL-1β (Li et al., 2021). By precluding these downstream events, oridonin may attenuate the cycle of inflammatory damage and fibrosis that underpins progressive renal injury in CKD (Li et al., 2021).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the proposed assays and eventual in vivo models of chronic kidney disease, the expected effect of oridonin centers on its ability to protect podocytes from NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated injury. More specifically, by covalently binding to cysteine 279 in NLRP3, oridonin is anticipated to inhibit ATP hydrolysis and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex. This mechanistic blockade should result in a reduction of caspase-1 activation—a key step in the maturation of IL-1β—and thereby diminish the secretion of this potent pro-inflammatory cytokine (He et al., 2018). In podocytes, such suppression is expected to reduce pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death that directly compromises the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and leads to proteinuria. Preservation of podocyte viability would, in turn, help maintain glomerular barrier integrity, minimizing the leakage of plasma proteins into the urine and limiting the ensuing fibrotic response in the renal interstitium (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nMoreover, the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB and p38-MAPK signaling pathways could provide additional benefits by reducing overall renal inflammation. In animal models of kidney injury—such as those induced by ischemia–reperfusion or diabetic nephropathy—treatment with compounds that inhibit these pathways has been correlated with improved renal function parameters (Huang et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2021). Therefore, beyond its direct effect on podocyte inflammasome activity, oridonin may exert broader renoprotective actions by dampening inflammatory cascades that contribute to interstitial fibrosis and progressive renal insufficiency. In this context, oridonin’s oral bioavailability and established history in traditional medicine support the feasibility of translating these preclinical findings into clinical benefit for CKD patients (Su et al., 2024).\n\nIt is important to note that while direct evidence of oridonin’s effects on human podocytes remains to be fully elucidated, the expression of NLRP3 in podocytes has been demonstrated in experimental models of CKD. Additionally, studies involving natural products that inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome—such as fucoidan in diabetic kidney disease—have provided supportive mechanistic insights, suggesting that the targeting of inflammasome activation in podocytes is a viable therapeutic strategy (Wang et al., 2022).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nOverall, oridonin emerges as a compelling therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease, given its well-documented mechanism of inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome and its extensive background in modulating inflammatory pathways. Its natural origin and historical use in traditional Chinese medicine provide a robust basis for its safety profile, and preclinical studies have demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, including models of colitis, gout, and even acute kidney injury (Ding et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2021). Strengths of oridonin include its specificity for NLRP3 via covalent binding to a critical cysteine residue, which has been shown to yield nanomolar potency in relevant assays (He et al., 2018). Additionally, oridonin’s ability to modulate secondary pathways (NF-κB, p38-MAPK, and Nrf2) may amplify its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective benefits, addressing multiple facets of CKD pathophysiology ranging from podocyte loss to interstitial fibrosis (Li et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nHowever, several weaknesses must also be considered. Despite promising preclinical data in other disease models, direct evidence for oridonin’s efficacy in modulating NLRP3 activation specifically in podocytes remains limited. Most mechanistic studies have been conducted in macrophages or other cell types, and while the extrapolation is reasonable given the conserved nature of inflammasome signaling, dedicated studies using human podocytes are needed to substantiate the proposed protective effects on proteinuria and interstitial fibrosis (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Furthermore, issues such as moderate potency, limited solubility, and variable bioavailability have been noted with oridonin, necessitating further formulation and structural optimization to ensure therapeutic efficacy in a clinical setting (Ding et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021). These pharmacokinetic considerations are particularly critical for a chronic indication like CKD, where long-term dosing and sustained target engagement are required.\n\nAnother consideration is the translation of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects observed in acute injury models or non-renal tissue into the context of chronic kidney disease, which involves complex and multifactorial pathophysiology. Although the suppression of inflammasome-driven pyroptosis is a promising target for preventing podocyte injury, CKD progression involves additional factors such as hemodynamic stress, metabolic derangements, and immune dysregulation that may not be fully addressed by NLRP3 inhibition alone (Huang et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2020). Consequently, while the mechanistic specificity of oridonin is appealing, its efficacy in a multifaceted chronic disease state like CKD requires rigorous preclinical validation followed by carefully designed clinical trials.\n\nIn summary, oridonin holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease based on its robust anti-inflammatory mechanism, particularly its ability to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome via covalent binding to cysteine 279. The compound’s multifaceted mechanism—encompassing inhibition of caspase-1 activation, IL-1β maturation, and subsequent pyroptosis—could translate into preservation of podocyte integrity, reduction in proteinuria, and attenuation of interstitial fibrosis, all of which are critical endpoints in CKD management (He et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). Nonetheless, challenges related to drug solubility, bioavailability, and the direct demonstration of efficacy in podocytes must be addressed. Given its strong preclinical validation in other inflammatory conditions, further targeted studies focusing on its renal effects and optimization of drug-like properties are warranted before it can be advanced as a viable treatment for CKD (Tan et al., 2021; Su et al., 2024). Overall, while there is a clear mechanistic rationale supporting the therapeutic potential of oridonin in CKD, additional studies specifically assessing its effects in relevant renal cell types and chronic disease models will be critical to fully validate its clinical utility.\n\nReferences  \nClinicalTrials.gov.

"(Disulfiram, 0)","(INF4E, 4)","Candidate 1, Disulfiram, benefits from a long clinical history, well‐characterized PK/PD, and decades of safety data in humans, which greatly de‐risks translation. Its recently described mechanism—covalent inhibition of gasdermin D to block pyroptosis—directly addresses a core inflammatory driver of CKD progression and is supported by in vivo efficacy in ischemia–reperfusion acute kidney injury models. Although chronic CKD data are lacking, the mechanistic rationale is clear, the target (GSDMD) is expressed in tubular epithelial cells, and molecular studies demonstrate on‐target engagement. Candidate 2, INF4E, offers a compelling, upstream mechanism by irreversibly inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly via NACHT‐domain covalent binding. However, it remains at an earlier stage: no CKD‐specific in vivo data exist, its safety and off‐target profile in renal cells are untested, and covalent acrylates carry inherent toxicity concerns. While INF4E’s novelty and potency as a submicromolar NLRP3 inhibitor are strengths, they do not outweigh the translational advantage of Disulfiram’s established human safety, demonstrated kidney efficacy in AKI models, and direct relevance to CKD pathobiology. Consequently, Disulfiram presents a higher likelihood of successful experimental outcomes and clinical translation in CKD.","Between the two candidates, Disulfiram (ID 0) is preferred because it: 1) has robust human safety and PK data enabling rapid repurposing; 2) demonstrates preclinical efficacy in relevant kidney injury models; 3) targets a terminal pyroptosis effector (GSDMD) highly relevant to CKD inflammatory–fibrotic progression; and 4) poses fewer novel toxicology risks. INF4E (ID 4), though mechanistically attractive, lacks direct CKD data, human safety validation, and carries higher off‐target and toxicity uncertainty given its irreversible covalent mechanism.",43,"(0, 4)","{'hypothesis': 'Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nDisulfiram is a synthetic small‐molecule drug originally discovered more than seventy years ago and is well known for its unique chemical structure featuring a tetraethylthiuram disulfide core. It is typically synthesized via the oxidation of diethyldithiocarbamate salts derived from the reaction of carbon disulfide with diethylamine, producing a compound with a central disulfide bond that confers its thiol‐reactive properties (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13). Chemically, disulfiram belongs to the dithiocarbamate family and is classified pharmacologically as an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor. Historically, this inhibition of ALDH has been the molecular basis for its clinical application as an alcohol aversion agent, where disulfiram induces the accumulation of acetaldehyde following alcohol ingestion, causing an assortment of discomforting physiological effects such as flushing, nausea, and tachycardia (Lu et al., 2021, p. 12). More recently, however, disulfiram has assumed a new identity in drug repurposing initiatives; its ability to interact covalently with cysteine residues in target proteins – a consequence of its thiuram disulfide structure – has attracted considerable attention in the context of inflammatory diseases. In particular, its capacity to interfere with the function of gasdermin D (GSDMD) via covalent modification is emerging as a promising mechanism by which disulfiram could counteract pathological inflammatory pathways (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4). This newly recognized activity places disulfiram within a therapeutic class of established drugs that are being re‐evaluated beyond their original indications, seeking to exploit their long clinical history and known safety profiles for novel applications such as the modulation of pyroptosis in inflammatory pathologies like chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nDisulfiram has a long-established history, primarily being used in the management of chronic alcohol use disorder since its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the early 1950s. As a stand‐alone therapy, its effectiveness in producing a pronounced aversive reaction to ethanol intake has made it a mainstay in addiction medicine. Over the decades, disulfiram has been administered safely to vast numbers of patients – a fact that is of critical importance when considering repurposing efforts, as its pharmacokinetics, dosing parameters, and toxicity profiles are well documented (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3). In addition to its established role in alcohol abstinence, disulfiram has been repurposed for a number of other applications. Emerging investigations have highlighted its promising activity in malignancies, where disulfiram, often in conjunction with supplemental copper, has demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against cancer stem cells via mechanisms that involve proteasome inhibition and modulation of redox homeostasis (Lu et al., 2021, pp. 13–14; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). More recently, its anti-inflammatory potential has been explored in the context of infectious diseases and systemic inflammatory responses. For instance, disulfiram has been evaluated in sepsis models, where its inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis led to reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines and improved survival in animal models (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). In models of ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), disulfiram pretreatment was shown to ameliorate renal dysfunction and histological damage by suppressing the noncanonical caspase-11–GSDMD inflammatory axis (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6). Although direct clinical studies of disulfiram in chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis remain limited, the encouraging preclinical signals from acute kidney insults and its capacity to modulate cell death pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation suggest that disulfiram—and its metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate—might be effective in attenuating the injurious inflammatory cascades observed in CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, the repurposing hypothesis for disulfiram in chronic kidney disease centers on its recently identified inhibitory effect on gasdermin D (GSDMD), a pore-forming effector protein that is indispensable for the execution of pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory, lytic form of programmed cell death triggered by the activation of inflammasomes. When these multiprotein complexes form in response to pathogenic stimuli or sterile injury, they lead to the activation of inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1, and in noncanonical pathways, caspase-4/5/11. These enzymes cleave GSDMD to generate an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) that oligomerizes and inserts into the plasma membrane to form pores, thereby releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) into the extracellular milieu (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17). Disulfiram has been shown to block this crucial terminal step in pyroptosis by covalently modifying a conserved cysteine residue (Cys191 in human GSDMD and Cys192 in murine GSDMD) through a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. This chemical modification prevents the oligomerization and subsequent membrane pore formation by GSDMD, thereby directly inhibiting the execution phase of pyroptosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). Moreover, disulfiram’s activity is potentiated in the presence of copper ions, which may stabilize its reactive metabolites such as diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC), enhancing its inhibitory potency in cellular assays (Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18). The outcome of this inhibition is a significant reduction in the pyroptotic cell death cascade, as evidenced by decreased IL-1β release and overall attenuation of inflammatory signaling. In the context of the kidney, specifically within tubular epithelial cells (TECs), the inflammatory microenvironment driven by inflammasome activation is one of the critical factors in the progression from acute injury to chronic fibrosis. TECs are known to express inflammasome components and are susceptible to pyroptosis, which contributes to interstitial inflammation and fibrogenesis (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Therefore, by inhibiting the cleavage and activation of GSDMD in these cells, disulfiram has the potential to preserve tubular integrity and prevent the inflammatory cascade that ultimately drives chronic kidney injury.\n\nExpected Effect:  \nBased on the proposed hypothesis and data from related inflammatory and renal injury models, disulfiram is predicted to exert a protective effect in the setting of chronic kidney disease by targeting the final common pathway of pyroptotic cell death. In a typical in vitro assay using primary tubular epithelial cells or established TEC lines, treatment with disulfiram at concentrations within the non-cytotoxic range (e.g., 0.1–5 µM as indicated in hypoxia/reoxygenation models) is expected to prevent the formation of GSDMD pores, thereby reducing cell membrane disruption, limiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18), and preserving cell viability (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11). The expected molecular signature following disulfiram treatment would include decreased levels of cleaved (active) GSDMD, reduced caspase-11 activation along with lower concentrations of circulating cytokines, as well as preserved markers of epithelial cell integrity. Given that GSDMD and components of the inflammasome are expressed in tubular epithelial cells (as supported by studies focusing on renal inflammatory pathways; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 7–9; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 9–10), the inhibition of GSDMD pore formation directly addresses a mechanistic driver of tubular injury. This would translate into reduced interstitial inflammation and limited myofibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition, which are critical steps in the fibrotic process that underpins CKD progression (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Ultimately, the expectation is that a therapeutic regimen involving disulfiram may slow or even halt the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease by mitigating the damaging effects of pyroptosis.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nDisulfiram presents several attractive features as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. The strengths of disulfiram include:  \n1. A well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profile, supported by decades of clinical use in alcohol aversion therapy, which facilitates rapid translation into new clinical contexts (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Lu et al., 2021, p. 12).  \n2. A clear and innovative mechanism of action based on the inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis. This mechanism is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of CKD, where inflammasome activation and resultant pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells contribute to interstitial inflammation and fibrosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11).  \n3. The potential for its active metabolite, diethyldithiocarbamate, and the enhancing role of copper complexation to improve its potency as a pyroptosis inhibitor further bolster the therapeutic rationale (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18; Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34).  \n4. Preclinical evidence in models of acute kidney injury (ischemia-reperfusion injury) demonstrates that disulfiram can ameliorate renal dysfunction through inhibition of the caspase-11–GSDMD axis, suggesting that similar effects may be achieved in chronic inflammatory settings underlying CKD (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11).  \n\nHowever, there are also potential weaknesses and gaps that warrant further exploration:  \n1. Despite promising preclinical data in acute injury models and other inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, direct evidence of disulfiram’s efficacy in chronic kidney disease models remains limited. The available studies do not present long-term data specific to CKD or renal fibrosis, which is critical for validating its use in a chronic condition (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6).  \n2. While the mechanism of covalent modification of GSDMD at Cys191 is well supported by molecular studies, the extrapolation of these findings to tubular epithelial cells in the kidney (as opposed to macrophages or other inflammatory cells) requires additional confirmation. It is essential to verify that TECs exhibit similar susceptibility to the gasdermin D inhibitory effects of disulfiram under pathological conditions (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n3. Dosage optimization, chronic toxicity assessments, and potential off-target effects in the renal context have not yet been extensively characterized. Although the historical human use of disulfiram supports a favorable safety profile, the dosing regimen for CKD might differ from that used for alcohol aversion therapy, given the distinct pharmacodynamics required to inhibit pyroptosis in kidney tissues (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8).  \n4. Another consideration is the effect of systemic modulation of pyroptosis. Since pyroptosis is integral to effective immune responses under certain circumstances, indiscriminate long-term inhibition could potentially compromise host defenses against infections. This balance between therapeutic efficacy in CKD and preservation of necessary immune functions must be carefully evaluated in preclinical models and eventually in clinical trials (Hu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n\nIn summary, disulfiram emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease due to its novel mechanism of targeting gasdermin D-induced pyroptosis—a pathway that is increasingly recognized as a critical driver of renal inflammation and fibrogenesis. Its long clinical history, established oral bioavailability, and well-characterized safety profile offer substantial advantages that could accelerate its translation into CKD-focused studies. The evidence from acute kidney injury models and inflammatory disease research forms a strong mechanistic rationale for its use to preserve tubular epithelial integrity and mitigate interstitial inflammation. Nevertheless, further detailed studies are imperative to validate its effectiveness in chronic kidney models, delineate optimal dosing strategies, and ensure that the inhibition of pyroptosis does not adversely affect normal immune surveillance. Based on the data reviewed—from biochemical studies demonstrating covalent modification of GSDMD (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8) to preclinical studies in renal injury models (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6)—the overall evaluation supports continued investigation of disulfiram as a repurposed agent in CKD. Its potential to modulate a critical pathogenic pathway in chronic kidney injury could represent a novel therapeutic intervention that merits further preclinical and clinical development (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18).\n\nReferences  \nCai, Q., Sun, Z., Xu, S., Jiao, X., Guo, S., Li, Y., Wu, H., & Yu, X.

It is an acrylate derivative belonging to a class of compounds that harness α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl (Michael acceptor) functionalities to achieve covalent, irreversible inhibition of target proteins. Its discovery emerged during screening campaigns that looked for submicromolar potency against NLRP3, with subsequent chemical optimization to balance reactivity and cytotoxicity. Specifically, INF4E (also referred to in some studies as compound 9) was identified for its ability to selectively inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation by binding covalently to the NACHT domain’s ATP‐binding site, thereby interfering with ATP hydrolysis required for the conformational changes that lead to inflammasome assembly (Cocco et al., 2017; Blevins et al., 2022). As a member of the acrylate derivatives class, similar compounds have been explored in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular disorders, where targeting NLRP3 has shown promise. Members of this chemical class have a well‐documented history of being used as selective covalent modifiers with potential in modulating inflammatory signaling cascades.  \n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of INF4E and its related chemical family primarily stems from preclinical studies where they have been shown to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in various models of inflammation. INF4E was originally validated in sepsis models, demonstrating efficacy in reducing systemic inflammation, and subsequent studies extended its utility to show anti‐pyroptotic effects in macrophage cell lines with submicromolar potency. Moreover, related acrylate derivatives have been explored in inflammatory bowel disease models, where modifications to reduce cytotoxicity led to the generation of analogues such as INF39. Although the preclinical literature for this class of inhibitors is robust in the context of sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, and even in models of ischemic injury in the heart, there is no direct literature evidence that INF4E has been specifically used for treating chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis. Searches in Clinical Trials databases for “NLRP3 inhibitor AND chronic kidney disease” have revealed only nascent clinical exploration of NLRP3 inhibitors in renal disease, with most candidates like MCC950 and OLT1177 being at early development stages (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023). Thus, while INF4E’s mechanism of NLRP3 inhibition is highly relevant to inflammatory processes, its therapeutic history in kidney disease remains limited to preclinical mechanistic rationale rather than established clinical or veterinary use in CKD.  \n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, INF4E exerts its action by covalently binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, specifically targeting its ATP‐binding site. The NACHT domain is essential for NLRP3 oligomerization and subsequent inflammasome assembly. INF4E’s acrylate (Michael acceptor) moiety reacts with cysteine residues present in this domain, thereby irreversibly blocking ATP hydrolysis. The inhibition of ATP hydrolysis interferes directly with the required conformational changes that transform NLRP3 from an inactive to an active state capable of recruiting the adaptor protein ASC and procaspase‐1. Consequently, the subsequent cleavage of caspase‐1 is prevented, which in turn stops the maturation and release of key pro‐inflammatory cytokines, notably IL‐1β and IL‐18 (Mezzaroma et al., 2021; Cocco et al., 2017).  \nThis covalent binding mechanism is particularly significant because it offers prolonged inhibitory effects owing to its irreversible nature. In proximal tubular epithelial cells, where hypoxia serves as a potent priming signal for inflammasome activation and contributes to chronic inflammation and fibrosis, inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E is hypothesized to prevent the cascade leading to caspase‐1 activation, thus mitigating caspase‐1–dependent pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death—and reducing the release of IL‐18 (Blevins et al., 2022; Komada & Muruve, 2019).  \nThe biochemical interactions of INF4E align with the known structure–activity relationships of electrophilic acrylate derivatives, as these compounds are designed to target the ATPase activity of NLRP3. By interfering with this enzymatic function, INF4E halts the nucleation of the inflammasome complex, thereby curtailing downstream signaling that ultimately leads to pyroptosis and fibrogenesis. The short-lived yet potent irreversible binding is a hallmark of this class of inhibitors, which has been exploited in several preclinical studies to provide a potent blockade of inflammation (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \n\nExpected Effect:  \nIn the context of the proposed assay and the underlying pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease, INF4E is anticipated to exhibit a therapeutic effect by mitigating hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation in proximal tubular epithelial cells. Hypoxic conditions are known to prime and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in these cells, and this process is a major contributor to tubular cell injury, pyroptosis, and subsequent fibrogenic signaling—all key drivers of CKD progression.  \nThe expected outcome when applying INF4E would be a significant reduction in ATP hydrolysis that is crucial for NLRP3 activation, thereby preventing the subsequent assembly of the inflammasome complex. This inhibition should lead to a decrease in caspase‐1 activity, ultimately lowering the maturation and secretion of IL‐18 (and possibly IL‐1β). Reduced levels of IL‐18 would then limit the inflammatory and fibrogenic signaling cascades that promote the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis. In assays using hypoxic proximal tubular cells, one would therefore predict reduced markers of pyroptosis, improved cell viability, and a lower expression of fibrogenic proteins such as TGF-β and α-SMA.  \nThere is also supportive evidence that NLRP3 is expressed in proximal tubular cells and that its activation is directly linked to inflammatory responses and fibrosis under hypoxic conditions (Ochoa et al., 2023; Komada & Muruve, 2019). The selective inhibition of NLRP3 by INF4E should thus translate into improved cellular integrity and a mitigated progression of the inflammatory milieu that typifies CKD. This expected modulation of pyroptosis and fibrosis markers provides a clear biochemical rationale for using INF4E as an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic therapeutic candidate in kidney disease models.  \n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe analysis of INF4E as a repurposed drug candidate for chronic kidney disease presents both promising and challenging aspects. One major strength of INF4E lies in its clearly defined mechanism of action; by targeting the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and interfering with ATP hydrolysis, INF4E offers a direct method to abrogate inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. This is particularly relevant in CKD, where hypoxia-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in proximal tubular cells is a key pathological event leading to pyroptosis, inflammation, and fibrotic remodeling (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019).  \nAnother strength is its proven submicromolar potency as demonstrated in phenotypic screens, along with a degree of oral bioavailability in rodent models that supports the feasibility of future in vivo investigations (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021). This potency, combined with its specificity for the NLRP3 inflammasome, positions INF4E as a candidate with the potential to modulate inflammatory responses without broadly suppressing the entire immune system. Moreover, by specifically reducing IL-18 release, INF4E may offer advantages over broader anti-inflammatory approaches that risk impairing normal host defense mechanisms (Thomas et al., 2022).  \nA potential weakness, however, is the risk associated with irreversible covalent binding, which, while conferring prolonged effects, may also lead to off-target toxicity if the selectivity is not absolute. Some acrylate derivatives have been noted for cytotoxicity issues, and although chemical optimization—such as the development of related compounds like INF39—has been undertaken to alleviate these concerns, it remains a critical point for evaluation in renal cells that are already susceptible to injury under hypoxic conditions (Cocco et al., 2017; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \nFurthermore, while the mechanistic rationale for targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome in CKD is strong, the clinical translation of NLRP3 inhibitors has been slow. Currently, only limited clinical trial data are available for NLRP3 inhibitors in CKD, and the majority of evidence remains at the preclinical level (ClinicalTrials.gov; Ochoa et al., 2023).  \nAnother consideration is that chronic kidney disease is a multifactorial condition wherein inflammasome activation is just one of several pathogenic processes, including metabolic dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and oxidative stress. Therefore, while INF4E may effectively block one critical pathway—namely, hypoxia-induced inflammasome activation—it might need to be combined with therapies targeting other aspects of CKD pathogenesis to achieve a comprehensive therapeutic effect (Unknown Reference; Mulay, 2019).  \nDespite these challenges, INF4E’s selectivity for a mechanistically validated target, its oral availability, and its demonstrated efficacy in related inflammatory models provide a strong rationale for further investigation. In assays designed to model hypoxic tubular injury, INF4E is expected to reduce pyroptosis and fibrogenic signaling, thereby slowing CKD progression. The drug’s success in other inflammatory contexts, such as sepsis models, lends additional weight to its potential, although caution must be exercised when extrapolating these data to the complex microenvironment of the kidney (Blevins et al., 2022; Mezzaroma et al., 2021).  \n\nContinued research should focus on dosing optimization, safety profiling in kidney-specific models, and investigation of combination strategies that target both inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in CKD (Komada & Muruve, 2019; Mulay, 2019; Pagliaro & Penna, 2023; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nOverall, INF4E represents a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for chronic kidney disease due to its targeted mechanism of action, which aligns well with an established pathogenic pathway in CKD—namely, hypoxia-driven NLRP3 inflammasome activation in proximal tubular cells. Its ability to block the ATPase activity of NLRP3, thereby preventing both caspase-1 activation and IL-18 release, underpins a novel strategy aimed at mitigating pyroptosis and subsequent fibrogenic signaling cascades. While challenges such as potential off-target cytotoxicity, the need for extensive in vivo validation in CKD models, and integration into a multifactorial therapeutic approach remain, the compelling preclinical data for related compounds and the rigorous mechanistic underpinnings provide a strong basis for advancing INF4E in further preclinical studies and eventual clinical trials. Continued research should include detailed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological evaluations in renal models, as well as assessments of its efficacy in reducing markers of inflammation, pyroptosis, and fibrosis in hypoxic proximal tubular cells. Given the complexity of CKD, INF4E may ultimately be best suited for combination therapy alongside agents addressing complementary pathogenic mechanisms. Overall, the potential strengths of INF4E—rooted in its selective, irreversible inhibition of a well‐validated molecular target—are balanced by the need for careful evaluation of safety and clinical translatability in the setting of chronic kidney disease (Liu et al., 2023; Mulay, 2019; Thomas et al., 2022).  \n\nReferences:  \nBlevins, H.

"(MCC950, 9)","(Disulfiram, 0)","Both candidates target inflammatory pathways implicated in CKD, but differ in evidence strength, mechanistic clarity, and CKD relevance. Disulfiram (ID:0) is an FDA-approved ALDH inhibitor repurposed for inflammasome/pyroptosis blockade via covalent modification of gasdermin D. Its safety profile is well established in alcohol‐aversion therapy, and preclinical data demonstrate efficacy in acute kidney injury (ischemia–reperfusion) and sepsis models. However, direct evidence in chronic CKD or renal fibrosis models is lacking, and off-target thiol reactivity raises concerns about dosing, chronic toxicity, and unintended immune suppression. The mechanism—blocking GSDMD pore formation—is plausible and specific to pyroptosis execution, but extrapolation from macrophages to tubular epithelial cells in chronic contexts requires validation. MCC950 (ID:9) is a diarylsulfonylurea analog that selectively binds the NACHT domain of NLRP3, preventing ATP hydrolysis, inflammasome assembly, and downstream caspase-1 activation. It has been extensively validated in multiple rodent models of chronic renal disease (diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, adenine-induced CKD), showing repeated reductions in proteinuria, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis. Mechanistic studies (SPR, mutagenesis) confirm high specificity, and non-human primate safety data support tolerability. Although clinical data in CKD patients remain sparse, MCC950’s targeted upstream MoA addresses a core driver of CKD progression, with multiple chronic models providing robust translational evidence. Disulfiram’s strengths—long clinical history and novel GSDMD target—are outweighed by gaps in chronic‐model efficacy and potential off-target liability. MCC950’s strong preclinical CKD evidence, precise upstream mechanism, and emerging safety profile confer higher probability of successful translation.","MCC950 outperforms disulfiram on the most critical axes: it has direct, robust preclinical efficacy in multiple chronic kidney disease models; a well‐characterized, specific, and upstream mechanism of action targeting NLRP3 inflammasome activation (which addresses both cytokine release and pyroptosis); and a favorable risk/benefit profile supported by non‐human primate safety data. Disulfiram, while safe in its approved indication and promising in acute inflammatory injury, lacks chronic CKD model validation, poses off‐target thiol reactivity risks, and may compromise host defense when chronically dosed. Thus, MCC950 has a higher likelihood of efficacious, safe, and translatable CKD therapy.",44,"(0, 9)","{'hypothesis': 'Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)', 'answer': 'Proposal for Disulfiram (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #D9773)\n\nOverview of Therapeutic Candidate:  \nDisulfiram is a synthetic small‐molecule drug originally discovered more than seventy years ago and is well known for its unique chemical structure featuring a tetraethylthiuram disulfide core. It is typically synthesized via the oxidation of diethyldithiocarbamate salts derived from the reaction of carbon disulfide with diethylamine, producing a compound with a central disulfide bond that confers its thiol‐reactive properties (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13). Chemically, disulfiram belongs to the dithiocarbamate family and is classified pharmacologically as an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor. Historically, this inhibition of ALDH has been the molecular basis for its clinical application as an alcohol aversion agent, where disulfiram induces the accumulation of acetaldehyde following alcohol ingestion, causing an assortment of discomforting physiological effects such as flushing, nausea, and tachycardia (Lu et al., 2021, p. 12). More recently, however, disulfiram has assumed a new identity in drug repurposing initiatives; its ability to interact covalently with cysteine residues in target proteins – a consequence of its thiuram disulfide structure – has attracted considerable attention in the context of inflammatory diseases. In particular, its capacity to interfere with the function of gasdermin D (GSDMD) via covalent modification is emerging as a promising mechanism by which disulfiram could counteract pathological inflammatory pathways (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4). This newly recognized activity places disulfiram within a therapeutic class of established drugs that are being re‐evaluated beyond their original indications, seeking to exploit their long clinical history and known safety profiles for novel applications such as the modulation of pyroptosis in inflammatory pathologies like chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nDisulfiram has a long-established history, primarily being used in the management of chronic alcohol use disorder since its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the early 1950s. As a stand‐alone therapy, its effectiveness in producing a pronounced aversive reaction to ethanol intake has made it a mainstay in addiction medicine. Over the decades, disulfiram has been administered safely to vast numbers of patients – a fact that is of critical importance when considering repurposing efforts, as its pharmacokinetics, dosing parameters, and toxicity profiles are well documented (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3). In addition to its established role in alcohol abstinence, disulfiram has been repurposed for a number of other applications. Emerging investigations have highlighted its promising activity in malignancies, where disulfiram, often in conjunction with supplemental copper, has demonstrated selective cytotoxicity against cancer stem cells via mechanisms that involve proteasome inhibition and modulation of redox homeostasis (Lu et al., 2021, pp. 13–14; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). More recently, its anti-inflammatory potential has been explored in the context of infectious diseases and systemic inflammatory responses. For instance, disulfiram has been evaluated in sepsis models, where its inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis led to reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines and improved survival in animal models (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). In models of ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), disulfiram pretreatment was shown to ameliorate renal dysfunction and histological damage by suppressing the noncanonical caspase-11–GSDMD inflammatory axis (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6). Although direct clinical studies of disulfiram in chronic kidney disease or renal fibrosis remain limited, the encouraging preclinical signals from acute kidney insults and its capacity to modulate cell death pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation suggest that disulfiram—and its metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate—might be effective in attenuating the injurious inflammatory cascades observed in CKD.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nAt the molecular level, the repurposing hypothesis for disulfiram in chronic kidney disease centers on its recently identified inhibitory effect on gasdermin D (GSDMD), a pore-forming effector protein that is indispensable for the execution of pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory, lytic form of programmed cell death triggered by the activation of inflammasomes. When these multiprotein complexes form in response to pathogenic stimuli or sterile injury, they lead to the activation of inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1, and in noncanonical pathways, caspase-4/5/11. These enzymes cleave GSDMD to generate an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) that oligomerizes and inserts into the plasma membrane to form pores, thereby releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) into the extracellular milieu (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17). Disulfiram has been shown to block this crucial terminal step in pyroptosis by covalently modifying a conserved cysteine residue (Cys191 in human GSDMD and Cys192 in murine GSDMD) through a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. This chemical modification prevents the oligomerization and subsequent membrane pore formation by GSDMD, thereby directly inhibiting the execution phase of pyroptosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8). Moreover, disulfiram’s activity is potentiated in the presence of copper ions, which may stabilize its reactive metabolites such as diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC), enhancing its inhibitory potency in cellular assays (Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18). The outcome of this inhibition is a significant reduction in the pyroptotic cell death cascade, as evidenced by decreased IL-1β release and overall attenuation of inflammatory signaling. In the context of the kidney, specifically within tubular epithelial cells (TECs), the inflammatory microenvironment driven by inflammasome activation is one of the critical factors in the progression from acute injury to chronic fibrosis. TECs are known to express inflammasome components and are susceptible to pyroptosis, which contributes to interstitial inflammation and fibrogenesis (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Therefore, by inhibiting the cleavage and activation of GSDMD in these cells, disulfiram has the potential to preserve tubular integrity and prevent the inflammatory cascade that ultimately drives chronic kidney injury.\n\nExpected Effect:  \nBased on the proposed hypothesis and data from related inflammatory and renal injury models, disulfiram is predicted to exert a protective effect in the setting of chronic kidney disease by targeting the final common pathway of pyroptotic cell death. In a typical in vitro assay using primary tubular epithelial cells or established TEC lines, treatment with disulfiram at concentrations within the non-cytotoxic range (e.g., 0.1–5 µM as indicated in hypoxia/reoxygenation models) is expected to prevent the formation of GSDMD pores, thereby reducing cell membrane disruption, limiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18), and preserving cell viability (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11). The expected molecular signature following disulfiram treatment would include decreased levels of cleaved (active) GSDMD, reduced caspase-11 activation along with lower concentrations of circulating cytokines, as well as preserved markers of epithelial cell integrity. Given that GSDMD and components of the inflammasome are expressed in tubular epithelial cells (as supported by studies focusing on renal inflammatory pathways; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 7–9; Liu et al., 2023, pp. 9–10), the inhibition of GSDMD pore formation directly addresses a mechanistic driver of tubular injury. This would translate into reduced interstitial inflammation and limited myofibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition, which are critical steps in the fibrotic process that underpins CKD progression (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11). Ultimately, the expectation is that a therapeutic regimen involving disulfiram may slow or even halt the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease by mitigating the damaging effects of pyroptosis.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nDisulfiram presents several attractive features as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for chronic kidney disease. The strengths of disulfiram include:  \n1. A well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profile, supported by decades of clinical use in alcohol aversion therapy, which facilitates rapid translation into new clinical contexts (Shirley et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Lu et al., 2021, p. 12).  \n2. A clear and innovative mechanism of action based on the inhibition of gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis. This mechanism is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of CKD, where inflammasome activation and resultant pyroptotic cell death in tubular epithelial cells contribute to interstitial inflammation and fibrosis (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Liu et al., 2023, p. 11).  \n3. The potential for its active metabolite, diethyldithiocarbamate, and the enhancing role of copper complexation to improve its potency as a pyroptosis inhibitor further bolster the therapeutic rationale (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18; Hu et al., 2018, pp. 26–34).  \n4. Preclinical evidence in models of acute kidney injury (ischemia-reperfusion injury) demonstrates that disulfiram can ameliorate renal dysfunction through inhibition of the caspase-11–GSDMD axis, suggesting that similar effects may be achieved in chronic inflammatory settings underlying CKD (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 6–11).  \n\nHowever, there are also potential weaknesses and gaps that warrant further exploration:  \n1. Despite promising preclinical data in acute injury models and other inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, direct evidence of disulfiram’s efficacy in chronic kidney disease models remains limited. The available studies do not present long-term data specific to CKD or renal fibrosis, which is critical for validating its use in a chronic condition (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6).  \n2. While the mechanism of covalent modification of GSDMD at Cys191 is well supported by molecular studies, the extrapolation of these findings to tubular epithelial cells in the kidney (as opposed to macrophages or other inflammatory cells) requires additional confirmation. It is essential to verify that TECs exhibit similar susceptibility to the gasdermin D inhibitory effects of disulfiram under pathological conditions (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n3. Dosage optimization, chronic toxicity assessments, and potential off-target effects in the renal context have not yet been extensively characterized. Although the historical human use of disulfiram supports a favorable safety profile, the dosing regimen for CKD might differ from that used for alcohol aversion therapy, given the distinct pharmacodynamics required to inhibit pyroptosis in kidney tissues (Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 11–13; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8).  \n4. Another consideration is the effect of systemic modulation of pyroptosis. Since pyroptosis is integral to effective immune responses under certain circumstances, indiscriminate long-term inhibition could potentially compromise host defenses against infections. This balance between therapeutic efficacy in CKD and preservation of necessary immune functions must be carefully evaluated in preclinical models and eventually in clinical trials (Hu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Liu et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).  \n\nIn summary, disulfiram emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease due to its novel mechanism of targeting gasdermin D-induced pyroptosis—a pathway that is increasingly recognized as a critical driver of renal inflammation and fibrogenesis. Its long clinical history, established oral bioavailability, and well-characterized safety profile offer substantial advantages that could accelerate its translation into CKD-focused studies. The evidence from acute kidney injury models and inflammatory disease research forms a strong mechanistic rationale for its use to preserve tubular epithelial integrity and mitigate interstitial inflammation. Nevertheless, further detailed studies are imperative to validate its effectiveness in chronic kidney models, delineate optimal dosing strategies, and ensure that the inhibition of pyroptosis does not adversely affect normal immune surveillance. Based on the data reviewed—from biochemical studies demonstrating covalent modification of GSDMD (Hu et al., 2018, pp. 1–4; Shao et al., 2022, p. 8) to preclinical studies in renal injury models (Cai et al., 2022, pp. 3–6)—the overall evaluation supports continued investigation of disulfiram as a repurposed agent in CKD. Its potential to modulate a critical pathogenic pathway in chronic kidney injury could represent a novel therapeutic intervention that merits further preclinical and clinical development (Liu et al., 2023, p. 11; Custodio et al., 2022, pp. 15–18).\n\nReferences  \nCai, Q., Sun, Z., Xu, S., Jiao, X., Guo, S., Li, Y., Wu, H., & Yu, X.

It belongs to the diarylsulfonylurea class of compounds, which emerged from medicinal chemistry efforts that initially focused on sulfonylurea drugs such as glyburide. Glyburide was found to have anti‐inflammatory properties mediated by inhibition of the NLRP3 complex; however, its clinical utility as an anti-inflammatory agent was limited by its potent effects on insulin release and the consequent risk of hypoglycemia. To overcome these limitations, researchers refined the chemical structure and synthesized MCC950, a derivative that retains the inflammasome inhibitory activity of glyburide without disturbing insulin secretion. The design of MCC950 was based on structure–activity relationship studies that identified the importance of the diarylsulfonylurea moiety, and its eventual discovery positioned it as a gold-standard benchmark compound for NLRP3 inhibition (Kaur et al., 2025; Coll et al., 2019). This compound has been synthesized and purified by several vendors including Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #SML 2233), ensuring reproducibility and accessibility to research teams. Overall, MCC950 represents a promising example of rational drug design aimed at selectively targeting components of the innate immune system and addressing the inflammatory cascades that contribute to disease pathology.\n\nTherapeutic History:  \nThe therapeutic history of MCC950 is marked by extensive preclinical evidence spanning animal models of a wide array of inflammatory disorders. Initially investigated in models of auto-inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, MCC950 quickly emerged as the benchmark inhibitor for studying NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated inflammation. In rodent models of kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, salt-sensitive hypertension, and adenine-induced chronic renal failure, MCC950 has demonstrated significant reductions in proteinuria, attenuated fibrosis, and improvements in overall renal function (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). Preclinical studies conducted in diabetic models have shown that chronic treatment with MCC950 leads to marked improvements in histopathological kidney damage, as evidenced by reduced mesangial expansion and decreased podocyte injury (Zhang et al., 2019). In addition, rodent studies in salt-sensitive hypertensive models reveal that inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome via MCC950 results in lower blood pressure, decreased interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, and reduced collagen deposition in renal tissues (Krishnan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2025). Although robust evidence from animal studies supports its efficacy in models of chronic kidney disease (CKD), clinical translation remains limited with only sparse early-phase clinical trials referenced in the literature (ClinicalTrials.gov). Additionally, the favorable safety profile observed in non-human primate studies further underpins its potential for repurposing in CKD, although more clinical data are needed to fully establish its benefit–risk profile.\n\nMechanism of Action:  \nMCC950’s mechanism of action is both specific and well-characterized at the molecular level. The compound exerts its inhibitory effect by directly binding to the Walker B motif located within the NACHT domain of the NLRP3 protein. This binding interferes with the ATP hydrolysis that is essential for NLRP3 activation and subsequent oligomerization of the inflammasome complex (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Under normal pathological conditions, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC and the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into its active form. Active caspase-1 then processes pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), into their mature forms and also initiates gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death. By preventing ATP hydrolysis, MCC950 locks NLRP3 in an inactive conformation, thereby obstructing the assembly of the entire inflammasome complex, reducing caspase-1 activation and cytokine maturation (Kim et al., 2019; Zhan et al., 2023). In the context of human tubular epithelial cells (TECs), which express NLRP3 and contribute to renal inflammatory cascades, MCC950’s engagement with the Walker B motif is proposed to significantly curb inflammasome formation. Such direct target engagement has been validated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and mutagenesis assays that confirm the drug’s specificity and potency. Blocking inflammasome assembly not only reduces cytokine release but also limits the formation of gasdermin D pores that are responsible for pyroptotic cell death, thereby preventing tubular cell loss and reducing interstitial inflammation (Liu et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019).\n\nExpected Effect:  \nGiven its robust preclinical evidence, the expected effect of MCC950 in assays focusing on CKD and related kidney injury is multifaceted. In in vitro models using human TECs, the hypothesis is that treatment with MCC950 will prevent ATP hydrolysis, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 activation. As a result, the maturation and release of IL-1β and IL-18 will be significantly reduced, ultimately leading to lower levels of pyroptosis, attenuation of inflammation, and prevention of the fibrotic remodeling that often accompanies progressive CKD (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). In vivo, these effects are anticipated to manifest as decreased proteinuria, improved kidney function markers, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, and lower extracellular matrix deposition. This translates into a reduction in renal interstitial fibrosis and a preservation of normal tubular architecture, thereby ameliorating the progressive decline in renal function seen in CKD models. The expression profile of NLRP3 in TECs, coupled with its established role in mediating inflammatory and fibrotic responses, provides a solid rationale for targeting NLRP3 in chronic kidney disease (Zhang et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). The proposed mechanism is in alignment with the pathological features of CKD, where sustained low-grade inflammation and fibrosis lead to irreversible kidney damage.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nMCC950 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of chronic kidney disease due to several compelling strengths. First, its rational design as a selective NLRP3 inhibitor ensures that it directly targets a critical inflammatory pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of CKD. The extensive preclinical evidence in diverse animal models—from diabetic nephropathy to salt-sensitive hypertension and adenine-induced renal failure—strongly supports its renoprotective effects, including reductions in proteinuria, improved renal function, and diminished fibrotic remodeling (Krishnan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Sabra et al., 2023). Second, the detailed elucidation of its molecular mechanism—confirming binding to the Walker B motif in the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and preventing ATP hydrolysis—provides a clear mechanistic rationale that is essential for translational development (Coll et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022). Third, its favorable pharmacological properties, including oral bioavailability and a safety profile established in non-human primates, further underline its developmental feasibility (Kaur et al., 2025; ClinicalTrials.gov).  \n\nHowever, there are some potential weaknesses that must be carefully considered. Although rodent models have provided robust efficacy data, the translation of these effects to humans remains to be fully validated. There is a paucity of comprehensive clinical trials specifically targeting CKD with MCC950, which introduces uncertainty regarding its efficacy and potential off-target effects in a human patient population. Additionally, while the compound is highly selective for the NLRP3 inflammasome, it is critical to further elucidate its long-term safety and impact on global immune function, given the essential role of inflammasomes in host defense. In some experimental contexts, there has been variability in the inhibition of inflammation and fibrosis depending on the specific disease model, suggesting that its therapeutic window may differ based on disease etiology (Sabra et al., 2023). Despite these challenges, the overall evidence supports the further development of MCC950 as a mechanistic intervention in CKD, particularly in settings where inflammasome-driven pathology is predominant.\n\nIn summary, MCC950 is a well-characterized, rationally designed NLRP3 inhibitor with strong preclinical evidence demonstrating its renoprotective effects in various models of chronic kidney disease. Its specific binding to the Walker B motif of the NLRP3 NACHT domain and subsequent inhibition of ATP hydrolysis form the basis of its mechanism, reducing caspase-1 activation, IL-1β/IL-18 maturation, and gasdermin-D-mediated pyroptosis. These actions are expected to translate into reduced tubular epithelial cell death, diminished interstitial inflammation, and alleviation of fibrotic remodeling—key pathological processes in CKD progression. While further clinical validation is necessary, the strengths in mechanistic rationale, preclinical efficacy data, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties position MCC950 as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in chronic kidney disease (Coll et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2022).\n\nReferences  \nColl, R.
