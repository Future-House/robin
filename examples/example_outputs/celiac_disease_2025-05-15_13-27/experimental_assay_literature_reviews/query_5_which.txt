Query: Which high-content screening-compatible phenotypic and biochemical assays (e.g., fluorescence polarization, FRET-based inhibition sensors, activity-based probes for transglutaminase, mass spectrometry-based peptidomics, cytokine multiplex panels) are best suited to measure inhibition of gliadin-tTG interactions, antigen presentation, epithelial stress responses or immune cell activation in celiac disease cell culture platforms?

High-content screening for celiac disease cell culture models requires a multiparametric approach that combines biochemical, enzymatic, and phenotypic readouts. For inhibition of gliadin–tTG (tissue transglutaminase) interactions, activity‐based probes that covalently label active TG2 have proven exceptionally informative. In particular, biotinylated substrates such as 5‐biotinamidopentylamine (5‐BP) can be employed in conjunction with immunofluorescence or LC–MS quantification to directly monitor TG2 enzymatic activity and its inhibition in live cell assays, allowing sensitive detection of deamidation events on gliadin peptides (kim2019tissuestressand pages 92-99).

FRET‐based inhibition sensors and fluorescence polarization methods provide complementary means to detect the binding between gliadin peptides and TG2. These techniques employ donor–acceptor pairs that change their fluorescence properties upon conformational shifts induced by TG2 activity. They offer real-time, kinetic measurements of the enzymatic turnover and binding dynamics and are easily adapted to microplate formats required for high-content screening (kim2019tissuestressand pages 104-109).

For assessing antigen presentation, fluorescence‐labeled HLA–DQ2/DQ8 tetramers loaded with native or deamidated gliadin peptides allow direct visualization and quantification of peptide–MHC complex formation. This strategy can be integrated with high-throughput flow cytometry or imaging platforms to measure the frequency and phenotypic characteristics of gluten‐specific CD4+ T cells, thereby yielding detailed immunophenotypic readouts (levescot2022immunopathogenesisandenvironmental pages 3-4).

Epithelial stress responses can be robustly characterized using cytokine multiplex panels that quantify key markers such as IL‑15, IFNγ, and chemokines including CCL3 and CXCL10. Multiplex ELISA or bead‐based assays facilitate simultaneous detection of multiple cytokines secreted upon gluten exposure, linking epithelial injury to downstream immune activation. In parallel, imaging‐based assays that employ fluorescent antibodies to monitor cellular markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (e.g., ATF4, ATF6, and XBP1) are readily adapted for high-content screening, providing spatial and quantitative information on epithelial cell stress (ferrari2021probioticssupplementsreduce pages 8-10).

Immune cell activation is addressed by using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence assays that detect intracellular cytokines (such as IFNγ) and cytotoxic proteins (for example, granzyme B) in T cell populations. Advanced techniques have been developed to monitor low-frequency antigen-specific T cells by tetramer-based sorting as well as by multiplexed imaging of activation markers, enabling both the monitoring of kinetic changes in T cell activation and quantification of overall immune cell responses in co-culture models (johnson2024themultipleroles pages 1-5).

Additionally, mass spectrometry-based peptidomics offers a highly sensitive biochemical platform to quantify deamidated gliadin peptides and other post-translational modifications mediated by TG2. This method provides molecular-level insights into changes in peptide compositions and supports validation of inhibition data obtained from the activity-based and FRET-based sensor assays (kim2019tissuestressand pages 86-92).

Finally, imaging-based high content screening platforms that integrate quantitative PCR with fluorescent immunostaining can measure epithelial morphology changes, tight junction integrity, and inflammatory gene expression in response to gluten challenge or TG2 inhibitor treatment. These platforms combine biochemical readouts with spatially resolved phenotypic analyses, providing a comprehensive appraisal of antigen presentation, epithelial stress, and immune activation (monzani2022roleofer pages 11-15).

Altogether, a panel comprising activity-based probes for TG2, FRET and fluorescence polarization sensors, fluorescent tetramers for antigen presentation, cytokine multiplex panels, mass spectrometry-based peptidomics, and high-content imaging assays constitutes a robust toolkit for high-throughput screening of compounds targeting gliadin–tTG interactions and related immunopathologic pathways in celiac disease (kim2019tissuestressand pages 123-128).
