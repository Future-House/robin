Query: What are the molecular mechanisms by which tissue transglutaminase modifies gliadin peptides in the intestinal lumen and how can in vitro cell culture models replicate transglutaminase activity, gliadin uptake, deamidation, and epitope formation for subsequent immune activation assays?

Tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a calcium‐dependent enzyme that exerts its pathogenic effects in celiac disease primarily through post‐translational modifications of gliadin peptides in the intestinal lumen. Under conditions where calcium is abundant, TG2 adopts an “open” conformation that allows its catalytic domain to engage gliadin peptides. The enzyme predominantly catalyzes deamidation by hydrolyzing the γ-carboxamide group of glutamine residues, converting them into glutamic acid residues. This conversion introduces a negative charge at critical positions within the peptide, thereby increasing the binding affinity for HLA molecules (notably HLA-DQ2.5, HLA-DQ2.2, and HLA-DQ8) that are central to the adaptive immune response in celiac disease (amundsen2023transglutaminase2and pages 15-20, amundsen2023transglutaminase2anda pages 15-20).

In addition to deamidation, TG2 is capable of mediating transamidation reactions; here, the enzyme forms a transient thioester intermediate after attacking the glutamine residue. This intermediate can be resolved either by the nucleophilic attack of water—resulting in deamidation in the absence of suitable amine donors—or by primary amines such as lysine residues to form stable isopeptide bonds, leading to crosslinking between gliadin peptides or between gliadin and other proteins. Although crosslinking occurs, in the context of celiac disease, the deamidation reaction appears to be the dominant process that enhances gliadin immunogenicity (amundsen2023transglutaminase2and pages 20-23, buchold2022featuresofzed1227 pages 2-3).

Gliadin peptides are particularly prone to these modifications because of their high proline and glutamine content, which not only makes them resistant to complete proteolysis but also provides the optimal substrate motif for TG2 activity. Their persistence in the intestinal lumen allows these peptides to access the subepithelial lamina propria. There, TG2‐mediated modifications facilitate the presentation of these peptides by antigen-presenting cells, driving the gluten-specific CD4+ T-cell response that underpins celiac disease pathology (amundsen2023transglutaminase2and pages 15-20, buiten2017physicochemicalmodificationofa pages 35-40).

In vitro cell culture models have been developed to replicate these molecular events and to deconstruct the sequence of pathogenic steps precisely. These models typically utilize synthetic gliadin peptides—often defined sequences such as the 33mer and 34mer peptides, which contain immunodominant epitopes relevant for T-cell activation (amundsen2023transglutaminase2and pages 66-75, amundsen2023transglutaminase2anda pages 66-75). The synthetic peptides are incubated in media augmented with calcium ions, which promotes the activation of TG2, thereby allowing for the deamidation and transamidation reactions to occur in conditions that mimic the intestinal lumen.

To accurately reproduce TG2 enzymatic activity, researchers employ enterocyte lysates obtained from small intestine samples as a source of TG2. Such lysates, derived from both TG2-sufficient and TG2 knockout strains, allow investigators to confirm the specificity of TG2-mediated modifications by comparing outcomes in the presence or absence of active enzyme (amundsen2023transglutaminase2and pages 63-66, amundsen2023transglutaminase2anda pages 63-66). Furthermore, these lysates facilitate immunoprecipitation studies and enzymatic assays that detect isopeptide bond formation, providing biochemical validation of TG2 activity.

The in vitro systems are extended to the immunological domain through the use of co-culture assays. B-cell lines—often A20 lymphoma cells genetically engineered to express HLA-DQ2.5 and specific B-cell receptors—are incubated with the modified gliadin peptides to enable uptake via receptor-mediated endocytosis. This uptake can be monitored using fluorescently labeled peptides and quantified by flow cytometry (amundsen2023transglutaminase2and pages 66-75, amundsen2023transglutaminase2anda pages 66-75). Following internalization, antigen-presenting B cells process the peptides and present deamidated epitopes to gluten-specific T-cell hybridomas. The resulting T-cell activation is then measured by assessing the release of interleukin-2 (IL-2) via ELISA, which serves as a functional readout for epitope presentation and immune activation (amundsen2023transglutaminase2and pages 66-75, amundsen2023transglutaminase2anda pages 66-75).

Collectively, these in vitro models integrate TG2 activation by calcium, precise enzymatic modifications of synthetic gliadin peptides, and subsequent assays for antigen uptake and T-cell activation. This comprehensive approach provides a robust platform for dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying TG2-mediated gliadin modification and offers a controlled environment to test potential therapeutic interventions aimed at mitigating the immunopathology of celiac disease (buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 26-27).
