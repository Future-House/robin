Query: What are the signaling pathways and cytokine profiles, particularly involving IL-15, IFN-γ, IL-21 and NF-κB, that drive epithelial stress, enterocyte apoptosis and intraepithelial lymphocyte activation in celiac disease, and how can these be quantitatively assessed in human intestinal epithelial cell lines or patient‐derived organoid co-cultures?

IL-15, IFN-γ, IL-21, and NF-κB form an interlinked, synergistic network that is central to celiac disease pathogenesis by driving epithelial stress, enterocyte apoptosis, and intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) activation. IL-15 is produced at high levels in the lamina propria and on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells. It triggers epithelial stress and intraepithelial lymphocyte activation by engaging its receptor complex that signals mainly through the JAK/STAT pathway, leading to the upregulation of activating NK receptors (e.g., NKG2D) on IELs. This receptor engagement primes IELs for cytotoxicity, contributing directly to enterocyte apoptosis and villous atrophy (OpenTargets Search: celiac disease-IL15,IFNG,IL21,NFKB1; brown2018definingreovirusstrainspecific pages 28-36, dias2020fromchemistryto pages 36-39).

IFN-γ, produced both by gluten-specific CD4+ T cells and activated IELs, functions as an amplifier of the inflammatory cascade. It promotes a Th1-skewed immune response and contributes to enterocyte apoptosis through the activation of inflammasome pathways and induction of additional pro-apoptotic signals. This orchestrated response further destabilizes the epithelial barrier, leading to enhanced immune cell infiltration (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 1-2; brown2018definingreovirusstrainspecific pages 28-36).

IL-21, which is secreted primarily by CD4+ T cells, acts synergistically with IL-15 and IFN-γ to enhance both the proliferation and cytotoxic potential of IELs. It reinforces the cellular activation state through its own engagement of the JAK/STAT pathway and contributes to sustaining a pro-inflammatory environment in the gut. IL-21’s contribution is evident in its ability to amplify the deleterious effects of IL-15 on the intestinal epithelium (OpenTargets Search: celiac disease-IL15,IFNG,IL21,NFKB1; perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 15-16; kooywinkelaar2017cd4tcellcytokines pages 1-2).

NF-κB functions as a critical downstream transcription factor that integrates signals from IL-15, IFN-γ, and IL-21. Its activation leads to the transcription of a broad array of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic genes. Through its regulation of cytokine and chemokine expression, NF-κB contributes to sustaining the inflammatory milieu and further promotes epithelial cell apoptosis and barrier dysfunction (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 2-4; dias2020fromchemistryto pages 36-39; ferrari2021characterizationofmouse pages 14-18).

Quantitative assessment of these signaling pathways and cytokine profiles in vitro can be achieved using both human intestinal epithelial cell lines (for example, Caco-2 or T84) and patient‐derived intestinal organoid co-cultures with immune cells, including IELs. Messenger RNA levels of IL-15, IFN-γ, IL-21, and NF-κB target genes can be quantified using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (ferrari2021characterizationofmouse pages 14-18; perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 1-2). Protein concentrations of these cytokines are measured via ELISA or multiplex bead-based assays, which allow for the precise quantitation of secreted cytokine levels (Clinical Trial Search: celiac disease AND (IL-15 OR IFN-gamma OR IL-21 OR NF-kappaB) AND (epithelial OR enterocyte OR intraepithelial lymphocyte); NCT02637141, NCT03738475).

NF-κB activation itself can be monitored using reporter assays or Western blot analysis with phospho-specific antibodies to detect its activated state and nuclear translocation (dias2020fromchemistryto pages 36-39; perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 2-4). Additionally, cell death assays such as Annexin V/propidium iodide staining or TUNEL assays permit quantification of enterocyte apoptosis. IEL activation and proliferation are examined by flow cytometry using markers like Ki-67 and measurement of specific surface receptors (e.g., NKG2D) (kooywinkelaar2017cd4tcellcytokines pages 2-2, pages 9-9).

Integrating these methodologies in organoid co-culture systems enables a physiologically relevant recapitulation of epithelial–immune interactions, thereby providing a robust model to dissect the molecular underpinnings of disease and to evaluate the efficacy of targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at these cytokine pathways (kautzman2022roleofcytokine pages 36-40; perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 15-16).

In summary, the interplay between IL-15, IFN-γ, IL-21, and NF-κB forms a critical signaling network that leads to epithelial stress, enterocyte apoptosis, and IEL activation in celiac disease. These processes can be quantitatively assessed using a combination of molecular biology, immunoassays, and cell-based functional assays in both intestinal epithelial cell lines and patient-derived organoid co-cultures (OpenTargets Search: celiac disease-IL15,IFNG,IL21,NFKB1; brown2018definingreovirusstrainspecific pages 28-36, dias2020fromchemistryto pages 36-39, perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 1-2).
