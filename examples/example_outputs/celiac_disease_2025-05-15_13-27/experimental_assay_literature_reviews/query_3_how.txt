Query: How do zonulin-mediated tight junction regulation and epithelial barrier dysfunction contribute to gliadin peptide translocation in celiac disease, and which cell-based assays (e.g., TEER, paracellular tracer flux, tight junction protein imaging) most faithfully model dynamic barrier integrity changes upon gliadin exposure and therapeutic intervention?

Zonulin is a regulatory protein that controls the integrity of intercellular tight junctions (TJs) in the intestinal epithelium. In celiac disease, gliadin peptides bind to specific receptors (notably CXCR3) on enterocytes, initiating a MyD88-dependent signaling cascade that leads to the release of zonulin (khaleghi2016thepotentialutility pages 1-2, cardososilva2019intestinalbarrierfunction pages 5-7). Once secreted, zonulin interacts with receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) to trigger phosphorylation events, particularly of TJ-associated proteins like ZO-1, occludin, and various claudins (caviglia2019physiopathologyofintestinal pages 10-14, heickman2020zonulinasa pages 7-9). This phosphorylation disrupts the assembly and localization of these proteins, leading to a reversible opening of the paracellular pathway. The transient or sustained disassembly of TJs thereby increases intestinal permeability, allowing gliadin peptides, including immunodominant fragments such as the 33-mer peptide, to pass from the gut lumen into the lamina propria where they undergo deamidation by tissue transglutaminase (TG2) and subsequently activate antigen-presenting cells (cardososilva2019intestinalbarrierfunction pages 5-7, ferrari2021characterizationofmouse pages 14-18).

The resultant epithelial barrier dysfunction constitutes a pivotal step in the pathogenesis of celiac disease by facilitating the translocation of gliadin peptides. This translocation is the initial event that precedes an immune-mediated cascade, leading to intestinal inflammation and villous atrophy. In effect, zonulin-mediated TJ regulation directly couples gliadin exposure with the impaired barrier integrity observed in celiac patients (barbara2021inflammatoryandmicrobiotarelated pages 10-11, odenwald2017theintestinalepithelial pages 7-9).

For in vitro modeling of these dynamic changes, several cell-based assays have proven to be robust in capturing both functional and structural alterations induced by gliadin. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) is one assay that quantitatively measures the integrity of polarized epithelial cells cultured on permeable supports (e.g., Caco-2 cell monolayers). TEER provides real-time readings of the electrical resistance across the monolayer, and decreases in TEER reflect the opening of TJs and increased paracellular permeability upon gliadin exposure (cardososilva2019intestinalbarrierfunction pages 5-7, gujral2015effectofantigliadin pages 8-9).

Complementary to TEER, paracellular tracer flux assays employ labeled molecules—such as dextrans or other size-specific tracers—to quantify the extent of TJ leakage. These assays assess the passage of molecules through the paracellular space, further validating functional disruptions to barrier integrity (cardososilva2019intestinalbarrierfunction pages 7-9, odenwald2017theintestinalepithelial pages 7-9). In this context, the selective permeability increase observed for smaller molecules relative to larger ones helps to distinguish subtle alterations in the leak pathway rather than complete barrier breakdown (buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 2-3).

To gain detailed insight into the structural changes at the molecular level, imaging techniques such as immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy are employed to visualize the localization and expression of critical TJ proteins, including claudins, occludin, and zonula occludens (ZO)-1. These imaging methodologies reveal the disassembly, mislocalization, or altered expression patterns of TJ proteins following gliadin challenge, thereby complementing the functional data obtained from TEER and paracellular tracer flux assays (cardososilva2019intestinalbarrierfunction pages 9-10, gujral2015effectofantigliadin pages 8-9).

In summary, gliadin-induced zonulin release triggers a cascade of events that culminate in tight junction disassembly and subsequent epithelial barrier dysfunction. This dysregulation is central to the pathogenesis of celiac disease as it facilitates the paracellular translocation of gliadin peptides. The combined use of TEER measurements, paracellular tracer flux assays, and tight junction protein imaging represents the most effective experimental strategy for modeling these dynamic barrier alterations and for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring TJ integrity (cardososilva2019intestinalbarrierfunction pages 5-7, heickman2020zonulinasa pages 7-9, gujral2015effectofantigliadin pages 8-9).
