Assay Overview:
This assay is designed to evaluate the efficacy of candidate drugs in preventing epithelial apoptosis in celiac disease by measuring caspase-3/7 activity. In this approach, intestinal epithelial cells—either a transformed cell line such as Caco-2 or patient-derived intestinal organoids—are exposed to gliadin peptides along with pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFNγ, TNFα). These stimuli simulate the inflammatory milieu and gliadin-induced cellular stress observed in the small intestinal mucosa of untreated celiac disease patients. Fluorogenic substrates that become cleaved by active caspase-3/7 produce a measurable fluorescence signal, which serves as a rapid and quantitative readout of apoptosis. This readout directly reflects the degree of enterocyte death and, subsequently, the protective effect of drugs targeting these pathways (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 4-5).

Biomedical Evidence:
Epithelial apoptosis is a central pathological event in celiac disease, contributing significantly to villous atrophy and compromised barrier function. The inflammatory cytokines and gliadin peptides are shown to induce both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in enterocytes, leading to caspase-3 activation, a pivotal step in programmed cell death (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 5-7). Moreover, additional studies have demonstrated that increased expression of apoptotic markers in intestinal biopsies of untreated celiac patients is closely associated with mucosal injury (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 1-2). These findings are corroborated by clinical evidence showing that targeting apoptosis might improve epithelial integrity, reinstate effective barrier function, and ultimately influence disease progression. Thus, preventing apoptosis is not only a central mechanistic target but also holds translational relevance for therapeutic intervention in celiac disease (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 14-15).

Previous Use:
In previous research, similar epithelial cell models, including Caco-2 cells and patient-derived intestinal organoids, have been effectively used to model key aspects of celiac disease pathogenesis. Studies have measured caspase-3/7 activity as an endpoint to assess epithelial stress and death following exposure to gliadin peptides and pro-inflammatory cytokines (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 2-4). Furthermore, assays focused on apoptotic activity have provided essential mechanistic insights into how gliadin influences epithelial cell viability, thereby validating apoptosis as a pathogenic endpoint and a suitable target for drug screening. The readouts from these assays, including the fluorogenic detection of caspase activity, played a role in elucidating pathways that contribute to enterocyte injury, further solidifying the assay’s utility in early-stage drug discovery (manai2018theinvitro pages 13-15).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of this assay include its direct measurement of a fundamental pathological process in celiac disease and its capacity for high-throughput screening due to the rapid quantification of caspase-3/7 activity. The use of both Caco-2 cells and patient-derived organoids offers flexibility, allowing researchers to perform screening in a reproducible cell line with the possibility of validating findings in a clinically relevant human tissue model (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 2-3). This dual approach helps bridge the gap between reductionist in vitro assays and more complex tissue responses, thereby enhancing the translational potential of the discovery pipeline.
However, limitations exist. For instance, while apoptosis is a key endpoint, celiac disease pathogenesis also involves pyroptotic and necroptotic mechanisms as well as barrier dysfunction that may not be fully captured by a caspase-3/7 assay alone (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 10-12). There is also the concern that in some patient-derived organoid models, baseline apoptosis is not markedly elevated, suggesting that additional readouts such as barrier integrity or inflammatory cytokine profiles may need to be incorporated to provide a more comprehensive evaluation (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 8-9). Overall, the assay presents a robust platform for assessing compounds aimed at halting epithelial apoptosis, a validated and critical endpoint in celiac disease, but it should ideally be complemented with additional endpoints to account for the multifaceted nature of the disease pathology (gagliardi2021gutexvivosystemas pages 4-7).
