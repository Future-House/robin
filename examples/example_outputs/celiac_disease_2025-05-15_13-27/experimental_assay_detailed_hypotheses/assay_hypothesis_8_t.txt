Assay Overview:
This assay utilizes a co-culture of deamidated gliadin-loaded, HLA-DQ2-positive antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with gluten-specific CD4+ T-cell hybridomas. The design specifically models the antigen presentation step that drives the aberrant T-cell activation seen in celiac disease (CeD). In this setup, the APCs, which may be professional cells (e.g., B cells) or engineered cell lines expressing HLA-DQ2 molecules, are pulsed with deamidated gliadin peptides—key immunogenic moieties generated by tissue transglutaminase (TG2)-mediated deamidation. Gluten-specific CD4+ T cells, derived from patient samples or as hybridomas, are then introduced. The primary measurement is the quantification of interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion using an ELISA, which functions as a proxy for T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement and activation (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 49-52, petersen2020tcellreceptor pages 17-20).

Biomedical Evidence:
Celiac disease pathogenesis is driven by an abnormal immune response initiated by deamidated gliadin peptides that are selectively presented by HLA-DQ2 (and HLA-DQ8) molecules, thus activating gluten-specific CD4+ T cells. This activation leads to intestinal mucosal inflammation and villous atrophy (buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12). The assay directly recapitulates this critical interaction by mimicking deamidated gliadin presentation and subsequent T-cell activation. Clinically, increased IL-2 levels have been observed post-gluten challenge in CeD patients, correlating with disease activity. This underlines the importance of IL-2 as a readout in the assay, making it an accurate marker for the immune events that occur in CeD (NCT03409796, NCT03738475).

Previous Use:
Assays employing co-culture systems with HLA-DQ2-positive APCs and gluten-specific T cells have a robust history in drug discovery for CeD. They have been instrumental in defining the sensitivity of T cells to specific deamidated gliadin epitopes and in evaluating the efficacy of immunotherapeutic candidates. For instance, research using similar setups measured T-cell activation via IL-2 secretion to assess the potency of novel interventions such as high-affinity TCR-like antibodies and peptide-based immunomodulatory agents (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 12-15, frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 15-18). Additionally, studies with Nexvax2 and other candidate compounds have harnessed antigen-specific T-cell assays detailing reduction in T-cell responses as a biomarker of potential therapeutic effectiveness (petersen2020tcellreceptor pages 17-20). Thus, the literature supports the utility of this approach in identifying drugs that can block or modulate the driving immunopathogenic interactions of CeD (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 252-255).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of this assay include its direct relevance to the central events of CeD pathogenesis—antigen presentation and T-cell activation—providing a clear, quantifiable endpoint via IL-2 secretion. The use of a defined antigen (deamidated gliadin) and the inclusion of HLA-DQ2-positive APCs ensure disease specificity and high physiological relevance. Furthermore, the assay’s quantitative nature facilitates robust comparisons of drug efficacy and supports reproducibility across studies (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 49-52).

However, there are also weaknesses and limitations. The in vitro model may not fully capture the complexity of the in vivo intestinal environment, including contributions from other immune cell types (e.g., B cells, dendritic cells) and the influence of gut microbiota. Moreover, reliance solely on IL-2 as an activation readout might overlook other relevant cytokine and chemokine cascades that contribute to CeD pathology. Integrating additional readouts, such as IFN-γ and T-cell proliferation markers, could provide a more comprehensive assessment of drug effects. Despite these limitations, the assay is scientifically sound, cost‐effective, and aligns well with current drug discovery strategies targeting T-cell mediated inflammation in celiac disease (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 265-266, buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12).

In summary, the co-culture T-cell activation suppression assay represents a robust platform for early-stage therapeutic screening in celiac disease, directly addressing a central mechanism of disease pathogenesis and offering a quantitative readout to evaluate potential interventions.
