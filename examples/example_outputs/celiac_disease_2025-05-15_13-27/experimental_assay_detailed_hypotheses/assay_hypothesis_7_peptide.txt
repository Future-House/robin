Assay Overview:
This peptide–MHC presentation blockade assay is engineered to model the central event in celiac disease pathogenesis, namely the presentation of deamidated gliadin peptides by disease-associated HLA-DQ2 molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The assay uses fluorescent tetramers or conformation‐specific antibodies to detect complexes formed between deamidated gliadin peptides and HLA-DQ2; these complexes are quantified by flow cytometry. The readout is the surface density and frequency of peptide–MHC complexes on APCs, providing a direct measurement of peptide loading efficiency and inhibition in the presence of candidate compounds. The assay might be performed on cell lines or primary APCs such as B cells, dendritic cells, and plasma cells, given that plasma cells have been recognized as major peptide–MHC expressers in celiac disease lesions (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 1-3, høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 7-8).

Biomedical Evidence:
Celiac disease is known to be driven by an aberrant CD4+ T-cell response against deamidated gluten peptides bound to HLA-DQ2.5 molecules. The deamidation process—catalyzed by transglutaminase 2—enhances peptide binding affinity to HLA-DQ molecules, and the subsequent peptide–MHC complex is required for the activation of gluten-specific T cells (christophersen2019therapeuticanddiagnostic pages 3-3). Clinically, the presence of these complexes correlates closely with disease activity; patients consuming gluten exhibit robust presentation of deamidated gliadin–HLA-DQ complexes on intestinal APCs, while those on a gluten-free diet show reduced complex formation (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 3-5). Such data reinforce that blockade of peptide loading is directly relevant to the immunopathogenesis and therefore represents a compelling target for therapeutic intervention. The assay, by specifically assessing the formation and inhibition of these complexes, directly measures a critical mechanistic step in the disease cascade that leads to T-cell activation and intestinal inflammation (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 12-15).

Previous Use:
Peptide–MHC presentation blockade assays have been employed in both mechanistic studies and early therapeutic screening efforts. For instance, affinity-engineered human TCR-like antibodies, such as the 3.C11 antibody, have been used to not only detect but also functionally block the formation of deamidated gliadin–HLA-DQ2 complexes. These antibodies have demonstrated the ability to inhibit T-cell activation in vitro and even block proliferation and cytokine secretion, providing proof-of-concept that interfering with peptide–MHC formation can abrogate the pathogenic T-cell response (frick2019affinityengineeredhumanantibodies pages 1-4, frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 15-18). Furthermore, studies using flow cytometry to quantify pMHC complexes on APCs have clarified that plasma cells and B cells are predominant in presenting these complexes within the inflamed intestinal mucosa of celiac patients (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 7-8). Such discoveries have advanced our understanding of the cellular targets within the intestine and validated the use of this assay platform for drug discovery in celiac disease.

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths:
• The assay directly interrogates a well-defined, disease-specific molecular interaction by quantifying the formation of deamidated gliadin–HLA-DQ2 complexes, which is central to celiac pathogenesis (christophersen2019therapeuticanddiagnostic pages 11-12).
• Its use of flow cytometry allows high sensitivity and single-cell resolution in detection, enabling detailed kinetic and quantitative assessments of peptide–MHC presentation and blockade efficacy (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 8-12).
• The platform has proven translational relevance, having been applied to both cell lines and primary patient-derived tissues, providing a robust model for early-stage therapeutic screening (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 15-20).

Weaknesses:
• In vitro systems may not fully capture the complex microenvironment and immune cell interactions in the intestinal mucosa, which could influence drug responses in vivo.
• The assay relies on highly specific reagents (fluorescent tetramers or conformation-specific antibodies) whose production and standardization could be resource-intensive, potentially affecting reproducibility across labs (frick2019engineeringtcrlikeantibodies pages 28-33).
• Given that regulatory mechanisms in peptide processing and antigen presentation might differ between experimental systems and human disease, complementary assays may be required to confirm biological activity seen in vitro.

Overall, this peptide–MHC presentation blockade assay is a robust, mechanistically informed platform for testing therapeutic candidates aimed at interrupting the antigen presentation cascade in celiac disease (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 15-18, høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 3-5). Its capacity to directly gauge the blockade of pathogenic peptide loading onto HLA-DQ2, coupled with quantitative sensitivity provided by flow cytometry, underpins its value in early-stage drug discovery and validation.
