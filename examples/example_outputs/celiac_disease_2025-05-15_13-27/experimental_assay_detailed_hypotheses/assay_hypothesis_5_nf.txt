Reasoning: Uses Caco-2 or HT-29 cells stably transfected with an NF-κB luciferase reporter to detect gliadin- or cytokine-induced pro-inflammatory signaling. Luminescence output provides a high-dynamic-range, kinetic measurement of drug effects on NF-κB activation.

Assay Overview:
The proposed assay employs Caco‑2 or HT‑29 cells that have been stably transfected with an NF‑κB luciferase reporter construct. This in vitro model is designed to simulate a key aspect of celiac disease pathogenesis—namely, the pro‑inflammatory activation of intestinal epithelial cells by gliadin peptides or cytokines. Upon exposure to these stimuli, the activated NF‑κB pathway drives the transcription of luciferase, providing a quantifiable luminescence output with a high dynamic range and kinetic capability. This output allows researchers to directly measure the impact of candidate therapeutic compounds on NF‑κB activation with high sensitivity and throughput (yu2022thenutritionalintervention pages 9-10).

Biomedical Evidence:
NF‑κB signaling plays a central role in the initiation and propagation of inflammation in celiac disease, as gliadin peptides trigger NF‑κB activation that results in the secretion of pro‑inflammatory cytokines and contributes to mucosal damage. The involvement of NF‑κB in mediating immune and oxidative stress responses has been consistently documented in both biomedical and clinical studies. For instance, resveratrol studies have shown that suppression of NF‑κB can ameliorate gut inflammation in celiac disease models, underscoring the mechanistic relevance of the pathway in disease progression (yu2022thenutritionalintervention pages 1-2). Moreover, clinical trial interest in NF‑κB, luminescence‐based readouts, and intestinal epithelial models reinforces the translational significance of this pathway in drug discovery for celiac disease (Clinical Trials Search: AREA[Condition]celiac disease AND AREA[Keyword]NF-κB OR luciferase OR intestinal epithelial model).

Previous Use:
Historically, NF‑κB luciferase reporter assays in Caco‑2 and HT‑29 cells have served as effective platforms to dissect the molecular mechanisms of inflammatory signaling in the gut. This assay format has been previously applied to screen anti‑inflammatory agents and to assess the impact of natural compounds like resveratrol in modulating NF‑κB activation. Key studies have demonstrated that modulation of NF‑κB in these intestinal epithelial models correlates with decreases in cytokine secretion and improved barrier function, providing valuable mechanistic insights into potential therapeutic effects (shearer2022investigationofnovel pages 75-79, yu2022thenutritionalintervention pages 12-13). Additionally, investigations into gluten‑induced signaling and RNA methylation-dependent mechanisms further highlight the value of these cellular models in understanding regulatory processes contributing to celiac disease pathogenesis (olazagoitiagarmendia2022gluteninducedrnamethylation pages 8-8).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of this assay include its high sensitivity and quantitative output, which enable kinetic measurements of inflammatory signaling in real time. The use of an immortalized human intestinal epithelial cell line provides a reproducible and well‑characterized system that is amenable to high‑throughput screening for modulators of NF‑κB activity. In addition, the assay focuses on a key pathogenic event (NF‑κB activation) that is centrally linked to gliadin‑mediated inflammation in celiac disease, rendering it directly relevant to screening potential therapeutics aimed at reducing this inflammatory cascade (yu2022thenutritionalintervention pages 9-10).

However, several weaknesses should be noted. First, Caco‑2 and HT‑29 cells, although useful, are limited in their capacity to fully recapitulate the complex in vivo environment of the intestinal mucosa, which involves multiple cell types, immune interactions, and three‑dimensional architecture that are better modeled in organoids (NCT05294107). Second, while NF‑κB signaling is an important mediator of inflammation, celiac disease pathogenesis is multifactorial and involves adaptive immune responses and additional pathways such as those involving FLT3 and ATG16L1, which may be underrepresented in a single‑readout assay (OpenTargets Search: celiac disease-NFKB1,NFKB2,RELA,RELB,RELC). Finally, the assay’s dependence on over‑expressed luciferase reporters might sometimes mask subtle modulatory effects or compensatory pathways that occur in a more physiologically representative system.

In conclusion, while the NF‑κB luciferase reporter assay in Caco‑2 or HT‑29 cells provides a robust, sensitive, and high‑throughput platform for initial screening of anti‑inflammatory compounds relevant to celiac disease, complementary models—including organoid systems and broader pathway analyses—are advisable to fully capture the complexity of the disease's pathogenesis (yu2022thenutritionalintervention pages 9-10, olazagoitiagarmendia2022gluteninducedrnamethylation pages 9-9).
