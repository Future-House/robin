ZED1227 (TG2 inhibitor),"Proposal for ZED1227 (TG2 inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
ZED1227 is a synthetic TG2 inhibitor developed specifically for the treatment of celiac disease. It belongs to the class of peptidomimetic small molecules that incorporate an electrophilic warhead designed to covalently bind the active site cysteine (Cys277) of tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2). The synthesis of ZED1227 was guided by detailed structural and enzymatic knowledge of TG2, as revealed by crystallographic studies and biochemical assays, and it follows a rational structure–activity relationship (SAR) design strategy similar to earlier compounds developed against TG2. In its chemical design, ZED1227 incorporates a Michael acceptor warhead that is oriented to target the enzyme’s catalytic triad (Cys277, His335, Asp358) with high specificity. Extensive synthetic organic chemistry methods—including classical protection/deprotection strategies and chromatographic purification—were employed to achieve purity and the desired molecular mass (approximately 528.6 g/mol), as documented in detailed synthetic protocols (Büchold et al., 2022). This candidate is representative of a new generation of targeted covalent inhibitors that belong to a broader class of irreversible inhibitors designed to block the enzymatic functions of disease-relevant proteins. Such compounds have previously been used in oncology and infectious diseases to achieve sustained target engagement by forming covalent bonds with active site residues. In the context of TG2, the synthetic origin of ZED1227 and its rational design provide it with the necessary attributes—selectivity, potency, and favorable pharmacokinetics—to inhibit the deamidation of gliadin peptides implicated in celiac disease pathogenesis (Büchold et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
TG2 as a target has been extensively validated both genetically and biochemically in celiac disease. Historically, TG2 was identified in 1997 as the autoantigen in celiac disease, and subsequent studies have underscored its critical role in deamidating gluten peptides, thereby enhancing their immunogenicity (Rauhavirta et al., 2019). The concept of targeting TG2 enzymatic activity has been explored using both reversible and irreversible inhibitors. Early compounds like Z-DON and other halomethyl ketone derivatives were developed on similar principles, providing proof-of-concept that enzyme inhibition can reduce immune activation and intestinal damage in preclinical models (Lopez, 2016). Although many earlier TG2 inhibitors were originally studied in the context of cancer, fibrosis, and neurodegenerative diseases, more recent efforts have concentrated on celiac disease due to the enzyme’s foundational role in the pathogenesis of gluten-induced enteropathy. ZED1227 is the first of its kind to be clinically evaluated for celiac disease; phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials have demonstrated that it is well tolerated in healthy volunteers and celiac patients during gluten challenge, with significant reductions in gluten-induced mucosal damage observed in the latter (Büchold et al., 2022; Ventura et al., 2021). While no veterinary use has been reported for TG2 inhibitors in celiac disease models, the preclinical success in rodent models of gluten challenge provides encouraging evidence that ZED1227’s mechanism is applicable to human disease. Previous literature on compounds of the same class has shown that targeted TG2 inhibition can modulate both enzymatic deamidation and cross-linking of gluten peptides, thereby preventing pathological T-cell activation and the subsequent cascade of cytokine release and epithelial barrier disruption (Bourgeois, 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, ZED1227 exerts its therapeutic effect by irreversibly inhibiting TG2’s enzymatic function. TG2 is a calcium-dependent enzyme that, under conditions of increased extracellular Ca2+ concentration, adopts an open conformation and catalyzes the deamidation of glutamine residues in gliadin peptides. This reaction converts neutral glutamine side chains into negatively charged glutamic acid residues, thereby increasing the affinity of gliadin peptides for HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules on antigen-presenting cells. The subsequent T-cell mediated immune response leads to the characteristic intestinal mucosal damage observed in celiac disease (Bourgeois, 2019). ZED1227’s design exploits the reactive nature of the enzyme’s catalytic cysteine (Cys277) by presenting a Michael acceptor moiety that is capable of forming a covalent thioether bond with the thiol side chain in Cys277. This irreversible binding effectively locks TG2 in an inactive state, preventing both transamidation and deamidation reactions. Detailed biochemical studies have confirmed that ZED1227 is highly specific for TG2, showing over 900-fold selectivity compared to related transglutaminase isoforms such as TG3 and FXIII-A2, which reduces the risk of off-target effects, particularly with respect to coagulation processes (Büchold et al., 2022; Isola et al., 2023). The site-directed covalent modification of TG2’s active site means that once ZED1227 binds, the inhibition is sustained, even in the presence of new substrate (gliadin peptides). Moreover, because TG2 in celiac disease is predominantly active in the extracellular milieu of the small intestine, and given that ZED1227 is designed with limited cellular permeability, the inhibitor preferentially accumulates in the intestinal lumen where it is needed most. Immunofluorescence studies using a monoclonal antibody specific for the ZED1227-TG2 complex have demonstrated that the drug co-localizes with TG2 at the brush border of villous enterocytes, further confirming its mechanism of action in situ (Büchold et al., 2022; Isola et al., 2023). In addition to blocking deamidation, the inhibition of TG2 prevents the formation of TG2-gliadin complexes that may otherwise drive autoantibody production, a hallmark of celiac disease. Through these combined mechanisms, ZED1227 disrupts the initial biochemical trigger for immune activation and cytokine production, including interleukin-15 (IL-15) overproduction, which is implicated in epithelial barrier disruption (Dotsenko et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
The expected therapeutic effect of ZED1227 in celiac disease is a reduction in gliadin-induced immune activation and consequent mucosal damage. Specifically, by inhibiting TG2, the drug is anticipated to prevent the deamidation of gluten peptides that renders them highly immunogenic. This, in turn, should lead to a decrease in the activation of gluten-specific CD4+ T cells, reduction in the local production of inflammatory cytokines (including IL-15), and ultimately, a preservation of the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Preclinical rodent studies have shown that administration of ZED1227 leads to marked attenuation of villous atrophy in gluten-challenged animal models (Bourgeois, 2019; Ventura et al., 2021). In human clinical trials, patients with celiac disease undergoing a controlled gluten challenge while receiving ZED1227 demonstrated significant reductions in mucosal damage as measured by improvements in villus height-to-crypt depth ratios and reductions in intraepithelial lymphocyte counts (Büchold et al., 2022; Dotsenko et al., 2024). At the cellular level, the inhibition of TG2 by ZED1227 maintains the normal expression patterns and function of tight junction proteins by indirectly preventing cytokine-mediated disturbance of epithelial cell–cell adhesion. This is crucial because prior research has shown that inflammatory cytokines, such as those released following TG2-mediated deamidation of gliadin peptides, can disrupt tight junction integrity and increase intestinal permeability (Jabri, 2021; Isola et al., 2023). Moreover, transcriptomic analyses of duodenal biopsies from treated patients have revealed that ZED1227 administration is associated with downregulation of immune activation signals and preservation of genes involved in epithelial integrity (Dotsenko et al., 2024). The preferential localization of ZED1227 to the luminal surface of the small intestine suggests that the drug acts primarily where gluten exposure occurs, effectively reducing the initial antigenic stimulus and the subsequent cascade of immune-mediated damage. This targeted effect is expected to provide clinical benefits in terms of reduced symptom severity, improved mucosal healing, and possibly a decreased reliance on a strictly gluten-free diet by mitigating the effects of inadvertent gluten exposure (Büchold et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating ZED1227 as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease, several strengths and potential weaknesses emerge. A major strength of ZED1227 is its rational design as a selective irreversible inhibitor of TG2, a key enzyme with a well-established role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The specificity of the compound, evidenced by high selectivity over other TG isoenzymes, addresses one of the central challenges in targeting TG2 without compromising other physiologically important transglutaminases (Büchold et al., 2022). Preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials provide robust evidence that ZED1227 effectively prevents gluten-induced mucosal injury, as demonstrated by improvements in histological markers and downregulation of inflammatory transcriptional signatures (Dotsenko et al., 2024; Ventura et al., 2021). The mechanism of converting a pathogenic enzymatic reaction into a covalently blocked state represents a state-of-the-art approach in drug development, and its localization predominantly at the intestinal epithelium minimizes systemic exposure, thus likely reducing the risk of off-target toxicities.

Another strength is the extensive biochemical rationale that supports TG2 as a clinically validated target. Numerous studies have implicated TG2 activity in the deamidation of gluten peptides and the subsequent triggering of pathogenic T-cell responses in genetically predisposed individuals. The fact that ZED1227 interferes with these critical early events suggests that it could change the natural history of celiac disease if administered appropriately (Bourgeois, 2019; Büchold et al., 2022). Additionally, the favorable safety profile observed in early human trials, with minimal adverse effects reported at therapeutic doses, underscores the potential for ZED1227 to be used as an adjunctive therapy for patients who might inadvertently consume gluten (Jabri, 2021).

However, some weaknesses should be noted. First, while ZED1227 is designed for localized luminal activity, its irreversible mechanism means that any off-target binding could lead to prolonged inhibition of TG2 in tissues where it is physiologically necessary, albeit currently there is evidence that extracellular TG2 inhibition is well tolerated (Büchold et al., 2022). Second, TG2 is ubiquitously expressed and involved in multiple biological processes, including extracellular matrix stabilization and cellular repair; thus, long-term inhibition may raise concerns about potential unforeseen side effects if systemic absorption occurs inadvertently (Bourgeois, 2019). Third, while preclinical models and controlled gluten challenges in clinical trials have shown promise, it remains to be seen whether ZED1227 can translate these benefits to the real-world situation of chronic, low-level gluten exposure, which is more variable than controlled challenges (Dotsenko et al., 2024; Ventura et al., 2021).

Furthermore, the mechanism by which ZED1227 might protect tight junctions and reduce cytokine-induced barrier breakdown, although logically consistent within the framework of TG2’s role in modulating immune responses, requires further mechanistic elucidation in human in vivo studies (Isola et al., 2023). A potential clinical challenge will be to define the appropriate dosing regimen that maintains sufficient TG2 inhibition in the intestinal lumen while minimizing any risk to normal TG2 function in non-target tissues. Finally, the long-term safety data in celiac patients, particularly regarding chronic administration and potential cumulative effects of irreversible inhibition, remain to be fully established in larger and longer-term clinical trials (Büchold et al., 2022).

Overall, ZED1227 represents a promising candidate for celiac disease therapy based on its mechanistically sound approach, biochemical specificity, and encouraging early clinical data. The strategy of blocking gliadin deamidation through targeted TG2 inhibition aligns with the current understanding of celiac pathogenesis and addresses a significant unmet need given the limitations of a strict gluten-free diet. If further clinical studies confirm its efficacy and long-term safety in a broader celiac population, ZED1227 could represent a groundbreaking addition to the armamentarium against celiac disease, potentially reducing the immune-mediated damage and improving the quality of life for many patients (Büchold et al., 2022; Dotsenko et al., 2024).

In summary, the strengths of ZED1227 include its synthetic, rationally designed structure with a proven covalent binding mechanism that irreversibly inhibits TG2, its high selectivity over related transglutaminase isoenzymes, its localized intestinal activity that minimizes systemic exposure, and its demonstrable efficacy in ameliorating gluten-induced intestinal damage in preclinical and early clinical settings. The potential weaknesses center around the challenges inherent to irreversible enzyme inhibition in a ubiquitously expressed protein, the need for long-term safety data under conditions of everyday gluten exposure, and ensuring that the beneficial effects on the intestinal barrier are maintained over time without interfering with physiological roles of TG2. Overall, there is strong preclinical, biochemical, and early clinical evidence to support the continued development and clinical evaluation of ZED1227 as a disease-modifying treatment for celiac disease (Büchold et al., 2022; Dotsenko et al., 2024; Ventura et al., 2021).

BL-7010 (gliadin-binding polymer),"Proposal for BL-7010 (gliadin-binding polymer)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
BL-7010 is a synthetic copolymer designed to act as an oral luminal binder that sequesters immunogenic fragments of gliadin—the protein component of gluten implicated in triggering celiac disease. Its chemical composition is based on the copolymerization of hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) with sodium‐4‐styrene sulfonate (SS), yielding a material often referred to as poly(HEMA-co-SS) (Van Buiten, 2017, pp. 21–26). The synthetic origins of BL-7010 trace back to advanced radical polymerization techniques that allow tight control over polymer molecular weight, polydispersity, and the density of functional groups. This control is essential because the efficacy of the polymer in binding gliadin depends on the precise presentation of negatively charged sulfonate groups as well as hydrophilic domains that can facilitate secondary interactions with gliadin peptides (Van Buiten, 2017, pp. 21–26; McCarville et al., 2014, pp. 1–2). As a drug candidate, BL-7010 belongs to the class of polymeric sequestrants—a group of agents that have been used in other therapeutic contexts such as phosphate binding in chronic kidney disease and bile acid sequestration in hypercholesterolemia. These applications rely on the ability of non-absorbable polymers to interact with undesirable molecules in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby preventing their absorption into the systemic circulation (McCarville et al., 2014, pp. 1–2). In celiac disease, where the immune reaction is initiated by the interaction of immunogenic gliadin peptides with the intestinal mucosa, a compound like BL-7010 is repurposed to intercept gliadin in the lumen, thus transforming a fundamental step in the pathogenesis of the disease into a manageable therapeutic target (Van Buiten, 2017, pp. 21–26).

Therapeutic History:
The concept of using polymeric agents to sequester dietary antigens in the gut is relatively novel in the field of celiac disease, yet it builds on decades of research into non-systemic, luminal binding agents. BL-7010, a member of this class, has been extensively evaluated in preclinical settings. Early studies employing BL-7010 in transgenic mouse models, particularly those engineered to express human HLA-DQ8 molecules (which closely mimic the genetic susceptibility observed in celiac disease patients), demonstrated that prophylactic administration of BL-7010 prior to gluten challenge results in a marked reduction in mucosal injury (McCarville et al., 2014, pp. 3–5). In these animal experiments, mice that received BL-7010 exhibited a significant decrease in the infiltration of intraepithelial lymphocytes and less evidence of villous atrophy when compared with control groups, findings that underscore the protective effect afforded by the polymer at the level of intestinal histology (McCarville et al., 2014, pp. 3–5). Ex vivo studies have further validated these protective effects in human tissues; duodenal biopsies obtained from celiac disease patients, when exposed to gliadin in the presence of BL-7010, displayed a dampened inflammatory cytokine profile and preserved barrier integrity (Van Buiten, 2017, pp. 99–103). Notably, clinical investigations have also been initiated under a formal clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2013) that recruited well-controlled celiac patients to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and systemic exposure of BL-7010, reinforcing the translation potential of this candidate from bench to bedside (McCarville et al., 2014, pp. 3–5; Van Buiten, 2017, pp. 99–103).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mode of action of BL-7010 is based on its ability to sequester gliadin peptides in the gastrointestinal lumen, thereby preventing their interaction with the epithelial cell surface and averting the subsequent cascade of immune activation. Gliadin, particularly its α-gliadin component, is characterized by a high content of proline residues that render it resistant to complete proteolytic breakdown during digestion, resulting in the persistence of relatively large immunogenic peptide fragments (Liang et al., 2009, pp. 1–2). These fragments, when absorbed or interacting with intestinal epithelial cells, can bind to surface receptors such as CXCR3. The engagement of CXCR3 by gliadin peptides is known to trigger downstream signaling events that lead to zonulin release—a molecule responsible for disassembling tight junction complexes (for example, affecting the localization of ZO-1) and thereby increasing intestinal permeability (Van Buiten & Elias, 2021, pp. 10–12). BL-7010 acts at this very early point in the pathological cascade by binding gliadin peptides through a dual modality of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Its sulfonate groups provide a strong negative charge that interacts with positively charged sites on gliadin, while complementary hydrophilic segments facilitate hydrogen bonding and van der Waals contacts (Liang et al., 2009, pp. 1–2; McCarville et al., 2014, pp. 5–8). The net result of these interactions is the formation of stable, non-absorbable complexes that prevent gliadin from being digested into smaller immunogenic peptides or from interacting with the CXCR3 receptor on intestinal epithelial cells. By effectively neutralizing gliadin in the lumen, BL-7010 prevents the release of zonulin, thereby preserving the integrity of the tight junctions and maintaining the proper trafficking of molecules across the gut barrier (Van Buiten & Elias, 2021, pp. 10–12). These molecular interactions have been studied using advanced techniques such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which show that BL-7010 binds gliadin with nanomolar dissociation constants, indicating a high degree of affinity and specificity (McCarville et al., 2014, p. 5). The sequestration process not only physically removes the stimulus for immune activation but may also induce conformational changes in the gliadin peptides, rendering them less capable of triggering the adaptive immune system (McCarville et al., 2014, pp. 5–8). Thus, by acting as a molecular shield at the gut lumen, BL-7010 interrupts the initiating events that lead to a breakdown of the epithelial barrier and subsequent autoimmune inflammation seen in celiac disease.

Expected Effect:
The working hypothesis behind BL-7010 is that its ability to sequester α-gliadin peptides in the intestinal lumen will prevent these peptides from engaging with CXCR3 receptors on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells. This receptor engagement normally stimulates zonulin release, leading to disassembly of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, and ultimately results in increased gut permeability and the initiation of a local inflammatory response. By preemptively binding gliadin, BL-7010 is expected to markedly reduce or eliminate zonulin release, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the intestinal tight junctions and maintaining normal barrier function (Van Buiten & Elias, 2021, pp. 12–13). In in vitro assays—such as those employing Caco-2 or Caco-2/15 intestinal epithelial cell monolayers—treatment with BL-7010 has resulted in preserved localization of ZO-1 at the lateral membranes and a significant decrease in gliadin-induced paracellular permeability (McCarville et al., 2014, pp. 8–9). Furthermore, in gluten-sensitized HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice, oral administration of BL-7010 prior to gluten challenge has been shown to reduce classic hallmarks of celiac disease pathology, including villous atrophy, intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) infiltration, and overall mucosal damage (McCarville et al., 2014, pp. 3–5). Ex vivo studies utilizing duodenal biopsies from celiac disease patients have reinforced these findings by demonstrating that BL-7010, when present during gliadin exposure, leads to a dampened inflammatory cytokine profile, which translates directly into lower immune activation and reduced epithelial injury (Van Buiten, 2017, pp. 99–103). In such settings, the expected effect is not only a reduction in inflammatory markers but also a measurable improvement in barrier function, as assessed by assays of intestinal permeability and tight junction integrity. The protection conferred by BL-7010 is anticipated to be highly relevant clinically: even if patients experience inadvertent gluten exposure—which is common despite efforts to maintain a strict gluten-free diet—the preemptive action of the polymer may mitigate downstream symptoms and mucosal damage, thereby providing a significant adjunctive therapy to dietary management (McCarville et al., 2014, pp. 8–9; Van Buiten, 2017, pp. 66–73; Van Buiten & Elias, 2021, pp. 12–13).

Overall Evaluation:
The cumulative evidence from biochemical, cellular, and animal studies makes a compelling case for the continued development of BL-7010 as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease. One of the greatest strengths of BL-7010 lies in its targeted mode of action. Unlike systemic agents that modulate the immune system or therapies that attempt to degrade gliadin enzymatically after it has already provoked an immune response, BL-7010 is designed to act at the earliest stage of pathogenesis by sequestering gliadin peptides directly in the intestinal lumen (McCarville et al., 2014, pp. 1–2, 5). This luminal action means that the compound can potentially prevent the entire cascade of events—from zonulin release and tight junction disassembly to immune cell recruitment and inflammatory cytokine production—that ultimately leads to the characteristic mucosal damage in celiac disease (Van Buiten & Elias, 2021, pp. 10–12). Preclinical models have consistently shown that administration of BL-7010 results in maintained barrier function, reduced intestinal permeability, and lower levels of markers of mucosal inflammation. Such effects are critical because even minor improvements in barrier integrity can result in a significant reduction in immune activation in patients who are exposed to small amounts of gluten (McCarville et al., 2014, pp. 3–5; Van Buiten, 2017, pp. 61–66).

Another important advantage is the non-absorbable nature of BL-7010. Since the polymer is designed to remain within the gastrointestinal tract and be excreted unchanged in feces, concerns regarding systemic toxicity and off-target effects are minimized (McCarville et al., 2014, p. 9; Van Buiten, 2017, pp. 96–99). This local activity not only enhances the safety profile but also allows for potentially prolonged usage as a chronic therapy in celiac disease—a condition for which patients may require lifelong treatment. The scalability of the synthesis methods, rooted in well-established radical polymerization techniques, further bolsters the feasibility of BL-7010 as a mass-produced drug candidate; industrial processes similar to those used for other luminal binding agents can be adapted for its manufacture (Van Buiten, 2017, pp. 21–26).

Despite these promising attributes, several challenges and potential weaknesses merit careful consideration. First, gliadin constitutes a complex and heterogeneous mixture of proteins, and the precise composition of gluten in the human diet varies between food sources and processing methods. It is therefore critical to ensure that BL-7010 has a sufficiently broad binding capacity to sequester all immunogenic epitopes across the spectrum of gliadin isoforms. Variability in gluten structure could potentially diminish the effectiveness of the polymer if any immunogenic peptides escape binding due to conformational differences (McCarville et al., 2014, p. 5; Van Buiten, 2017, pp. 61–66). Additionally, while preclinical studies in mouse models and ex vivo human tissue studies have provided robust evidence of efficacy, the translation of these findings to the complex environment of the human gastrointestinal tract remains a key question (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2013).

Another strategic challenge is the potential interaction of BL-7010 with other dietary components. Although its chemical design is optimized for gliadin binding, there is a theoretical risk that the polymer might non-specifically interact with other proteins or nutrients, which could interfere with their absorption or cause unintended gastrointestinal effects. However, preclinical safety assessments have so far indicated that BL-7010 demonstrates high selectivity for gliadin, reducing this concern (Van Buiten, 2017, pp. 61–66; McCarville et al., 2014, p. 5). Long-term studies in clinical settings will, however, be necessary to monitor for any subtle effects on nutrient uptake or alterations in the gut microbial community.

Furthermore, the dosing regimen represents another key factor that will determine clinical success. Because BL-7010 is designed to act in the luminal content of the gut, its effectiveness may be closely tied to the timing and frequency of dosing in relation to gluten ingestion. In real-world scenarios where gluten exposure can be intermittent and variable, determining an optimal dosing schedule that provides sufficient coverage without causing local irritation or other adverse effects will be essential. It is anticipated that early phase clinical trials, such as the ones referenced in NCT01990885, will address these pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic issues and pave the way for optimized treatment protocols (McCarville et al., 2014, pp. 8–9; Van Buiten, 2017, pp. 66–73).

When considering the overall therapeutic landscape for celiac disease, BL-7010 offers a novel intervention that directly targets the initial trigger of the disease rather than managing its downstream inflammatory consequences. Current therapeutic strategies, including strict gluten-free diets, enzyme supplements, and immunomodulatory drugs, each have inherent limitations, and many patients struggle with inadvertent gluten exposure that leads to persistent symptoms and mucosal damage. In this context, BL-7010’s capacity to neutralize gliadin peptides at the site of digestion offers a unique adjunctive benefit that may alleviate residual symptoms and reduce long-term complications associated with chronic gluten exposure (Van Buiten & Elias, 2021, pp. 12–13; McCarville et al., 2014, pp. 8–9).

Overall, the strengths of BL-7010 include its highly targeted mechanism of action, which intervenes at the earliest stage of disease pathogenesis; its excellent safety profile due to non-absorption and luminal confinement; and its robust preclinical efficacy evidenced by reduced intestinal permeability, preservation of tight junction proteins, and attenuation of mucosal inflammation. Its synthetic origin and reproducible manufacturing process further contribute to its viability as a drug candidate for long-term administration in a patient population that typically requires lifelong management of their condition (Pinier, 2011, pp. 112–115; McCarville et al., 2014, pp. 1–2).

Nonetheless, challenges remain. Variability in gluten composition, the intricate dynamics of the human gastrointestinal environment, potential interactions with other dietary components, and the need for precise dosing regimens underline the importance of rigorous clinical evaluation. It will be essential to ensure that the efficacy observed in controlled laboratory experiments remains consistent under the variable conditions of everyday life. Early phase clinical trials, such as the one referenced (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2013), will be crucial in addressing whether the preclinical benefits of BL-7010 can be replicated in human subjects and if it can ultimately serve as a reliable adjunct to the gluten-free diet.

In conclusion, BL-7010 represents a promising therapeutic candidate for celiac disease that is grounded in robust polymer chemistry and detailed immunopathological insights. Its innovative mechanism—sequestering gliadin peptides to prevent their interaction with CXCR3 receptors and blocking the subsequent zonulin release—addresses the underlying trigger of celiac disease rather than simply managing symptoms. The extensive preclinical data, which demonstrate improved barrier function and reduced inflammatory responses in both animal models and human ex vivo studies, strongly support its continued development (McCarville et al., 2014, pp. 3–5; Van Buiten, 2017, pp. 99–103; Van Buiten & Elias, 2021, pp. 13–15). Despite the challenges that must be overcome in translating these findings into clinical practice, the potential benefits of a non-absorbable, targeted treatment such as BL-7010 are considerable, especially given the significant unmet need among celiac patients who struggle to consistently maintain a strict gluten-free diet. Thus, the cumulative evidence underscores the importance of further clinical investigation into BL-7010 as an adjunctive or potentially even stand-alone therapy for celiac disease, with the promise of improving patient outcomes by protecting the intestinal barrier at the earliest possible stage of antigen exposure (Pinier, 2011, pp. 112–115; Van Buiten & Elias, 2021, pp. 10–12).

Latiglutenase (ALV003),"Proposal for Latiglutenase (ALV003)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Latiglutenase (ALV003) is an investigational enzyme therapy developed for the treatment of celiac disease. It is a recombinant formulation that combines two distinct gluten-specific proteases—one derived from germinating barley (a cysteine endoprotease, often referred to as EP‐B2) and a second prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) from microbial sources such as Sphingomonas capsulata. These enzymes are produced by recombinant DNA technology, ensuring consistent activity and purity. As an enzymatic therapy, ALV003 belongs to the class of glutenases, agents designed to enzymatically digest gluten peptides into smaller, less immunogenic fragments. The concept behind this approach draws on the observation that mammalian gastrointestinal proteases cannot fully cleave proline- and glutamine-rich gliadin peptides, which then trigger the pathogenic immune response in genetically predisposed individuals. Historically, enzyme-based therapies have been used to supplement or replace deficient digestive enzymes in conditions like lactose intolerance, but in the case of celiac disease, the goal is to degrade immunotoxic peptides before they can breach the epithelial barrier (Caio et al., 2020; Lähdeaho et al., 2014).

Therapeutic History:
The rationale for ALV003 emerged from preclinical studies demonstrating that gluten peptides, especially the 33-mer peptide known for its robust immunogenicity, resist degradation by endogenous proteases and are central to celiac disease pathogenesis. Early in vitro studies showed that the combination of a barley-derived cysteine protease and a microbial prolyl endopeptidase could degrade more than 90% of immunoreactive gluten epitopes under simulated gastric conditions. This promising biochemical activity led to a series of early-phase clinical trials. Phase 0 and Phase 1 studies examined safety and pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers and patients with well-controlled celiac disease; these trials established that ALV003 was generally safe and well tolerated when administered orally with gluten-containing meals (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; Lähdeaho et al., 2014). Phase 2a and 2b studies subsequently evaluated its ability to protect against gluten-induced mucosal injury in patients on a gluten-free diet, particularly during controlled gluten challenge periods. Although results on symptomatic improvement were sometimes mixed, several studies provided evidence that ALV003 could attenuate histological damage, as measured by preservation of the villous height-to-crypt depth ratio and reduction in intraepithelial lymphocyte counts (Lähdeaho et al., 2014; Kurppa et al., 2014). While ALV003 has not yet reached the stage of regulatory approval or widespread clinical use for celiac disease, its history in clinical trials has established its feasibility as an adjunct to the gluten-free diet and validated its underlying biochemical mechanism (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2009; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2010).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of Latiglutenase is grounded in its dual proteolytic system that targets the specific biochemical features of immunotoxic gluten peptides. Gluten proteins, particularly gliadins, contain sequences that are rich in proline and glutamine residues; these features render them resistant to degradation by human digestive enzymes. The therapeutic design of ALV003 addresses this problem in two sequential steps. First, the cysteine endoprotease component (derived from barley) cleaves gluten peptides at glutamine residues, thereby destabilizing the larger peptide structures and exposing additional cleavage sites. Second, the prolyl endopeptidase from Sphingomonas capsulata further hydrolyzes the newly exposed proline-rich sequences, effectively reducing the peptide size and consequently its immunogenic potential (Caio et al., 2020; Lähdeaho et al., 2014).

At the molecular level, this enzymatic cleavage disrupts the intact immunodominant sequences—such as the well-studied 33-mer peptide in gliadin—which are known to be presented by antigen-presenting cells in the context of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules. In doing so, ALV003 prevents the subsequent activation of gluten-specific CD4+ T cells, thereby limiting the inflammatory cascade that leads to mucosal damage. Beyond direct peptide cleavage, recent hypotheses suggest that by decreasing the load of immunogenic peptides reaching the intestinal mucosa, ALV003 might reduce the activation of the CXCR3 chemokine receptor pathway. In patients with celiac disease, activation of CXCR3 is linked to the release of the protein zonulin, a key regulator of intestinal tight junction integrity. Thus, by degrading gluten peptides before they trigger this cascade, ALV003 could reduce zonulin release, maintain transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), and ultimately prevent cytokine-driven tight junction disruption (Syage et al., 2019; Kurppa et al., 2014). Although the direct modulation of zonulin is an emerging aspect of its proposed mechanism, the primary, well-documented biochemical activity remains the enzymatic cleavage of gliadin peptides (Freeman, 2015; Kivelä et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
Given its dual-enzyme composition and robust in vitro activity, the expected effect of ALV003 in the proposed assay—and ultimately in clinical application—is the effective degradation of immunotoxic gliadin peptides in the gastrointestinal lumen. In an organoid assay or ex vivo intestinal model, the treatment with Latiglutenase is anticipated to lead to several interrelated outcomes. First, the degradation of gluten peptides should result in a measurable reduction in the pool of intact immunogenic peptides available to trigger an immune response. This reduction is expected to attenuate the release of zonulin—a peptide hormone that increases intestinal permeability by modulating tight junction proteins—and consequently preserve TEER in epithelial cultures (Nemteanu et al., 2022; Syage et al., 2019).

Subsequently, by preventing the crossing of immunogenic peptides into the lamina propria, ALV003 should decrease the activation of gluten-specific CD4+ T cells, leading to a decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-15 (IL-15). This reduction in cytokine production could further contribute to maintaining intestinal mucosal integrity and reduce the ensuing inflammatory damage typically observed in celiac disease. In vitro results from organoid assays and ELISpot studies have shown that gluten-degrading enzymes can indeed reduce markers of immune activation, suggesting that treatment with ALV003 may have both histological and symptomatic benefits in patients (Pérez et al., 2012; Lähdeaho et al., 2014). Furthermore, in a clinical context where seropositive patients—those with ongoing immune activation despite a gluten-free diet—are treated, post hoc analyses from trials have indicated dose-dependent improvements in gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain and bloating (Syage et al., 2019). Therefore, the expected outcome of administering ALV003 is the dual benefit of protecting the intestinal mucosa via biochemical degradation of gluten peptides and preserving barrier integrity through the modulation of zonulin release, ultimately resulting in symptom relief and improved quality of life for patients with celiac disease (Massironi et al., 2024; Kivelä et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Evaluating the potential of ALV003 as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease reveals several noteworthy strengths alongside some limitations. On the positive side, ALV003 is rooted in a strong mechanistic rationale. It specifically targets the primary trigger of celiac pathology—immunogenic gluten peptides—by utilizing a combination of enzymes that act synergistically to degrade sequences that are otherwise resistant to human proteases. This precise biochemical strategy not only reduces the antigenic load but also decreases subsequent immune activation, potentially leading to reduced zonulin release and preservation of tight junction integrity. Such an approach is particularly innovative as it addresses both the biochemical and barrier-disrupting aspects of gluten-induced pathology (Caio et al., 2020; Lähdeaho et al., 2014).

Moreover, Latiglutenase has undergone extensive preclinical and early-phase clinical evaluation. Multiple phase 1 and phase 2 studies have demonstrated its safety and bioactivity in controlled gluten challenge settings, showing histological evidence of reduced mucosal damage despite gluten exposure. This clinical history supports its feasibility and potential as an adjunct therapy to improve outcomes in patients who, despite adherence to a gluten-free diet, suffer from inadvertent gluten exposure and its consequences (Kurppa et al., 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008).

However, some challenges remain. Clinical trial data have been variable, particularly regarding symptomatic improvement, with some studies failing to demonstrate statistically significant benefits on patient-reported outcomes in the general celiac population. It appears that the benefit of ALV003 may be most pronounced in seropositive subgroups, indicating that its efficacy may depend on the extent of ongoing immune activation and gluten exposure in a given patient. Furthermore, ensuring that the enzyme retains sufficient activity in the highly acidic gastric environment is a critical formulation challenge. Gastric acid and the presence of other proteases may diminish the activity of ALV003, potentially limiting its capacity to completely degrade all immunogenic peptides if dosing or formulation is not fully optimized. Thus, while the biochemical rationale is robust, translational effectiveness in achieving consistent and clinically meaningful endpoints such as mucosal healing and symptomatic relief remains an area for further investigation (Massironi et al., 2024; Nemteanu et al., 2022).

Another consideration is that ALV003 is intended to act as an adjunct to a gluten-free diet rather than a replacement therapy. Its clinical utility is therefore limited to mitigating the effects of inadvertent gluten contamination, which, while a significant problem, does not entirely remove the burden of dietary vigilance from patients. Nonetheless, for those patients who experience accidental gluten exposure and consequent mucosal damage or symptoms, ALV003 represents a promising approach that could improve quality of life and reduce long-term complications (Syage et al., 2019; Pérez et al., 2012).

In summary, ALV003 shows considerable promise as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease based on its targeted enzymatic design, proven biochemical activity, and established safety profile in early clinical trials. Its mechanism of degrading proline-rich gliadin peptides directly addresses the key pathogenic event in celiac disease, and its potential to reduce zonulin-mediated tight junction disruption offers an innovative barrier-protective effect. Strengths include its rational design, supportive preclinical data, and safety demonstrated in human trials, while weaknesses relate to the variability in clinical symptom endpoints, potential issues with enzymatic stability in vivo, and the fact that it currently serves only as an adjunct to dietary management rather than a standalone treatment. Overall, further clinical validation with optimized dosing strategies and improved formulations is warranted to fully realize its potential as a complement to the gluten-free diet in managing celiac disease (Freeman, 2015; Kivelä et al., 2021; Kurppa et al., 2014).

AMG 714 (anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibody),"Proposal for AMG 714 (anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibody)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
AMG 714 (also known as PRV-015) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that has been developed to specifically target interleukin-15 (IL-15), a pro‐inflammatory cytokine implicated in the immunopathology of celiac disease. This therapeutic candidate is produced through recombinant DNA technology by engineering a chimeric antibody that has been further “humanized” to reduce immunogenicity in patients, placing it in the class of biologic immunomodulators. Monoclonal antibodies have been used extensively to target cytokines or cell surface antigens in a wide range of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, and AMG 714 capitalizes on this well‐established therapeutic paradigm. The natural basis for this candidate lies in the recognition that IL-15 drives a cascade of immune activation within the intestinal mucosa; hence, inhibiting IL-15 with a targeted antibody is hypothesized to modulate this pathway. This class of compounds, anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies, has demonstrated efficacy in diverse diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease by neutralizing pivotal cytokines that orchestrate chronic inflammation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ochoa et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
AMG 714 has undergone extensive preclinical and early clinical evaluation in the context of celiac disease and other IL-15–driven conditions. In clinical trials performed on adult patients with celiac disease—specifically in studies such as NCT02633020 and NCT02637141—the antibody was investigated for its capacity to reduce intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) activation and mucosal inflammation induced by gluten challenge (Amgen, 2016a, 2016b). These studies have shown evidence of target engagement, particularly a reduction in aberrant IEL density at higher doses, although the primary histological endpoint, measured by the villous height-to-crypt depth (VH:CD) ratio, was not significantly improved relative to placebo (Lähdeaho et al., 2019; Amgen, 2016b). Furthermore, AMG 714 is being evaluated in non-responsive celiac disease in a Phase 2b trial (NCT04424927) where its capacity to ameliorate patient-reported symptoms and modulate immune cell activation is under active investigation (Provention Bio, 2020). Prior to these studies in celiac disease, anti-IL-15 antibodies have also been studied in preclinical models of gluten-sensitive conditions as well as in other autoimmune indications, thereby lending support to IL-15 blockade as a therapeutic concept (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Unknown Reference).

Mechanism of Action:
IL-15 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is overexpressed in the intestinal mucosa of patients with celiac disease and plays a critical role in driving the activation, proliferation, and cytotoxic function of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). Normally, IL-15 signals through its high-affinity receptor complex that consists of a unique IL-15Rα subunit together with the IL-2/15 receptor β chain and the common γ chain, thereby triggering downstream signaling via the Janus kinase (JAK) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) pathways. This cytokine-mediated activation leads to enhanced expression of cytotoxic receptors such as NKG2D on IELs, and it lowers their threshold for activation such that they can kill stressed epithelial cells even in the absence of specific antigen recognition (Abadie & Jabri, 2014). AMG 714 functions by specifically binding to IL-15, thereby preventing its interaction with the IL-15 receptor complex. This blockade inhibits the downstream pro-inflammatory pathways including the activation of NK and CD8+ T cells that are ultimately responsible for the release of cytotoxic mediators like TNF-α and IFN-γ. In doing so, AMG 714 is expected to reduce the abnormal cytotoxicity of IELs, stabilize the expression of tight junction proteins, and ultimately prevent epithelial apoptosis under gluten challenge conditions (Abadie & Jabri, 2014; Ochoa et al., 2023). The antibody’s high specificity for IL-15 avoids the broader immune suppression seen with less selective immunosuppressive agents, providing a mechanistic rationale for improved clinical outcomes with a favorable safety profile (Meghnem et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for using AMG 714 in celiac disease rests on the expectation that neutralizing IL-15 in the lamina propria will interfere with the key pathogenic cascade leading to intestinal mucosal damage. Under gluten exposure, elevated IL-15 levels result in the activation and expansion of IELs, which in turn mediate epithelial cell apoptosis and the degradation of tight junction integrity. By blocking IL-15, AMG 714 is expected to reduce the release of inflammatory mediators (such as TNF-α and IFN-γ), lower MLCK (myosin light chain kinase) upregulation, and decrease IEL cytotoxicity, thus contributing to the stabilization of the epithelial barrier. In clinical assays, this mechanism should manifest as a reduction in aberrant IEL density within the mucosa, improvement or maintenance of the VH:CD ratio, and an amelioration of gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea. Histological assessments and patient-reported outcome measures from trials like NCT02637141 provide initial evidence that higher doses of AMG 714 are associated with reduced intraepithelial lymphocyte counts, suggesting that the anticipated molecular effects are indeed achievable in vivo (Lähdeaho et al., 2019; Unknown Reference). Furthermore, IL-15 is known to be expressed abundantly by intestinal epithelial cells and antigen-presenting cells in active celiac disease, supporting the rationale that AMG 714’s mechanism of action is well targeted to the disease-relevant cell types (Abadie & Jabri, 2014; De Nitto et al., 2009).

Overall Evaluation:
AMG 714 represents a promising translational candidate for addressing key pathogenic mechanisms in celiac disease by directly targeting IL-15, a central mediator of IEL activation and epithelial barrier disruption. The strengths of this therapeutic candidate lie in its high specificity for IL-15, as evidenced by its mechanism of neutralizing cytokine activity and reducing aberrant IEL activation observed in early-phase clinical studies. Its capacity to mitigate inflammatory cascades, when coupled with preliminary safety data reported in Phase 2 trials (such as NCT02633020 and NCT02637141), strongly supports the potential of AMG 714 to offer clinical benefits for patients who continue to experience mucosal damage despite adherence to a gluten-free diet (Amgen, 2016a, 2016b; Lähdeaho et al., 2019).

However, several weaknesses and challenges must also be acknowledged. First, while reductions in IEL density have been observed, the primary histopathological endpoint—the improvement in the villous height-to-crypt depth ratio—has not been significantly improved in some trials. This raises questions regarding whether IL-15 blockade alone is sufficient to reverse the complex tissue remodeling that occurs under conditions of gluten challenge (Lähdeaho et al., 2019; Scalvini et al., 2025). Second, given the multifactorial nature of celiac disease, which involves intricate interactions between genetic predisposition, gluten exposure, and complex immune responses, AMG 714 may need to be used in combination with other therapies to achieve full mucosal healing and restoration of barrier integrity (Abadie & Jabri, 2014; Unknown Reference). Third, while the safety profile appears acceptable, the potential for immunogenicity, the high cost associated with monoclonal antibody therapies, and the need for repeated dosing are significant limitations that must be balanced against the anticipated clinical benefits (Lähdeaho et al., 2019; Pan et al., 2015). Moreover, although AMG 714’s inhibition of IL-15 is expected to reduce IEL cytotoxicity and restore tight junction integrity, direct measurements of these downstream effects on tight junction proteins and overall barrier function remain to be clearly established in clinical settings (Abadie & Jabri, 2014; Unknown Reference).

In summary, AMG 714 exhibits a strong mechanistic rationale for treating celiac disease through selective IL-15 neutralization, a strategy supported by both biochemical insights and clinical proof-of-concept studies. Targeting IL-15 not only addresses the immune dysregulation that underlies IEL-driven epithelial damage, but it also represents a precision medicine approach that circumvents the broader immunosuppression associated with traditional therapies. The preclinical and early-phase clinical data indicate that AMG 714 can attenuate key immunopathological markers such as aberrant IEL activation, and thereby may stabilize or improve intestinal barrier integrity under gluten challenge conditions (Abadie & Jabri, 2014; Lähdeaho et al., 2019).

Nonetheless, further large-scale Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies with longer treatment durations, combination strategies, and more sensitive measures of intestinal barrier restoration are warranted to definitively establish clinical efficacy. Particular attention should be focused on evaluating whether AMG 714 can achieve robust histological improvement beyond symptom modulation, as the data to date suggest that while target engagement is achieved, the effects on primary morphological endpoints are modest. Additionally, possible combination regimens that may include agents directed at other inflammatory mediators or barrier-enhancing strategies should be considered to address the multifaceted nature of celiac disease pathogenesis (Unknown Reference; Scalvini et al., 2025).

Overall, the strengths of AMG 714 include its targeted mechanism of action, clinical evidence of reducing IEL-mediated inflammation, and its potential to address an unmet therapeutic need in non-responsive celiac disease. Its weaknesses, primarily the modest impact on endpoint histological measures and logistical challenges related to monoclonal antibody therapies, require further investigation. The current body of evidence warrants continued clinical development and further mechanistic studies, making AMG 714 a compelling candidate for repurposing toward the treatment of celiac disease (Abadie & Jabri, 2014; Lähdeaho et al., 2019).

Tofacitinib (JAK inhibitor),"Proposal for Tofacitinib (JAK inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tofacitinib is a synthetic, orally bioavailable small molecule that belongs to the class of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Originally discovered and developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and subsequently approved for ulcerative colitis, tofacitinib was synthesized through medicinal chemistry approaches optimized for high selectivity for JAK family members with preferential inhibitory activity on JAK1 and JAK3, although it has measurable activity against other family kinases such as JAK2 under certain conditions (Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 28–33). As a representative of a class of compounds commonly referred to as “jakinibs,” tofacitinib exemplifies the application of targeted small-molecule inhibition to modulate intracellular cytokine signaling pathways. This drug is produced via standard organic synthesis methodologies that allow for precise modifications to the core heterocyclic structure to achieve optimal pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles (Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 1–7). JAK inhibitors have been widely used for immune modulation in several autoimmune diseases, and their oral route of administration and ability to penetrate mucosal tissues contribute to their attractiveness as therapeutic agents in immune-mediated inflammatory conditions.

Therapeutic History:
Tofacitinib has an established therapeutic history in both rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, where numerous clinical trials have verified its efficacy and safety profile (Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 1–7; Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 25–26). Beyond these mainstream indications, there is emerging anecdotal and case‐report evidence supporting its off‐label use in conditions that share underlying inflammatory pathways with celiac disease. For instance, a clinical case report documented the successful use of tofacitinib in a patient with type II refractory celiac disease, resulting in clinical remission without significant adverse events (Grewal et al., 2022, p. 1). In addition, recent literature suggests promising results for tofacitinib in a patient with both refractory celiac disease and microscopic colitis, wherein complete remission was achieved even following gluten re‐exposure (Lenfant et al., 2023, pp. 2–3). Despite these isolated reports, systematic clinical trials specifically evaluating tofacitinib for celiac disease have yet to be registered, as evidenced by a search on ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Thus, while the pre‐existing clinical experience with tofacitinib in other immune‐mediated diseases provides a strong foundation, its use in celiac disease remains investigational at this point.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, tofacitinib exerts its therapeutic effects by binding competitively to the ATP‐binding site within the catalytic domain of JAK kinases, particularly JAK1 and JAK3 (Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 28–33). This inhibition results in the blockade of downstream phosphorylation events normally triggered by cytokine receptor engagement. Cytokines such as interleukin-15 (IL-15) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which are crucial drivers of the proinflammatory cascade in celiac disease, signal through receptors that engage JAK1 and JAK3. These cytokines normally promote the phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors, particularly STAT1 and STAT3. Phosphorylated STATs dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and initiate transcription of genes that mediate inflammatory responses, including the upregulation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) (Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 25–26; Sayoc-Becerra et al., 2020, pp. 7–9). MLCK is a well‐recognized mediator of tight junction disassembly, as its enhanced activity leads to contraction of the perijunctional actomyosin ring and consequent disruption of tight junction integrity. This process results in increased intestinal permeability—a hallmark of gluten‐induced enteropathy in celiac disease. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that inhibition of STAT1/3 phosphorylation by tofacitinib can prevent cytokine-induced barrier dysfunction in intestinal epithelial cells and colonoids, suggesting that the drug can maintain tight junction organization and preserve transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) (Sayoc-Becerra et al., 2020, pp. 7–9; Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 13–16). Thus, by blunting the JAK1/3-mediated signaling cascade downstream of IL-15 and IFN-γ, tofacitinib has the potential to reduce MLCK induction and counteract the disassembly of tight junctions, thereby preserving mucosal barrier integrity.

Expected Effect:
The acting hypothesis for repurposing tofacitinib in celiac disease is that its inhibition of JAK1/3 will attenuate the aberrant cytokine signaling elicited by gluten exposure. In gliadin-exposed organoid models—which recapitulate the human intestinal epithelium—exposure to gluten typically leads to elevated levels of IL-15 and IFN-γ. These cytokines activate the JAK/STAT pathway, leading to increased phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, which in turn upregulate the expression of MLCK and other genes that contribute to tight junction disruption. The expected effect of tofacitinib would be to diminish STAT1/3 phosphorylation, thereby reducing subsequent MLCK expression and preserving the architecture and function of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 and occludin (Sayoc-Becerra et al., 2020, pp. 7–9; Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 25–26; Coskun et al., 2013, pp. 2–3). In functional assays, this should translate into maintained or restored transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and reduced paracellular permeability compared to untreated, gliadin-challenged controls (Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 13–16). Since enterocytes express the IL-15 receptor complex and IFN-γ receptors abundantly, both signaling pathways being mediated via JAK1/3 are active in these cells (Coskun et al., 2013, pp. 2–3; Sayoc-Becerra et al., 2020, pp. 7–9). Therefore, by interfering with this cytokine network, tofacitinib is expected to blunt the inflammatory cascade that leads to barrier dysfunction, thereby mitigating one of the central pathophysiological events in celiac disease. This mechanistic rationale is supported by preclinical models in inflammatory bowel disease, where restoration of barrier integrity by tofacitinib was associated with normalization of tight junction protein expression and decreased cytokine secretion (da Costa Filho et al., 2025, pp. 8–9; Spalinger et al., 2021, p. 14).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, tofacitinib presents as a promising repurposing candidate for celiac disease based on its well-characterized mechanism of action, established clinical usage in other immune-mediated diseases, and its molecular suitability for targeting cytokine-induced barrier dysfunction. Among its strengths, tofacitinib’s oral bioavailability and mucosal penetration are major advantages that provide direct access to the intestinal epithelium, where gluten-induced inflammatory processes occur (Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 1–7). Its capacity to inhibit JAK1/3—and thus block the downstream activation of STAT1 and STAT3—is highly pertinent given the pivotal roles of IL-15 and IFN-γ in driving the pathological inflammation seen in celiac disease (Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 25–26; Sayoc-Becerra et al., 2020, pp. 7–9). Moreover, early case reports suggest that tofacitinib has been used with success in refractory celiac disease contexts (Grewal et al., 2022, p. 1; Lenfant et al., 2023, pp. 2–3), further lending credence to its potential utility in this patient population. The drug’s known ADME/Tox profile, garnered from extensive clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, supports its repurposing by mitigating some of the developmental risks typically associated with novel therapeutics (Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 1–7; Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 40–41).

However, there are also noteworthy weaknesses that warrant consideration. First, while isolated case reports and anecdotal evidence are encouraging, there is an absence of formal, large-scale clinical trials or extensive preclinical studies specifically targeting celiac disease with tofacitinib; a recent search of clinical trial repositories has yielded no registered studies exclusively focused on this indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This gap underscores the need for rigorous, disease-specific preclinical evaluations—ideally using gliadin-exposed human intestinal organoid models—to validate the hypothesized effects on tight junction integrity and MLCK expression (Sayoc-Becerra et al., 2020, pp. 7–9). Additionally, the inflammatory milieu in celiac disease can be complex and is characterized by both adaptive and innate immune responses; thus, it is critical to assess whether tofacitinib’s broad immunosuppressive action might inadvertently impair mucosal immune defense mechanisms in the gut, potentially increasing the risk of infections or compromising other aspects of intestinal homeostasis (Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 10–13; Shah et al., 2023, pp. 7–8). Moreover, the potential adverse events associated with JAK inhibitors—such as increased risk for infections, herpetic reactivation, and lipid profile alterations—have already been documented in the contexts of rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, and these risks will need to be carefully balanced when considering a chronic condition like celiac disease, especially in an otherwise benign state managed mainly by a gluten-free diet (Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 1–7; Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 40–41).

From the standpoint of biochemical plausibility, the hypothesis that tofacitinib could prevent cytokine-induced tight junction disassembly by reducing STAT signaling and subsequent MLCK induction is well supported by studies in other inflammatory contexts (Sayoc-Becerra et al., 2020, pp. 7–9; Coskun et al., 2013, pp. 2–3). The colonic and small intestinal epithelial cells express receptors for both IL-15 and IFN-γ, with downstream activation of JAK1/3 being central to the signaling cascade that ultimately leads to barrier dysfunction, making this a mechanistically sound target in celiac disease. However, it is notable that much of the mechanistic evidence comes from models of inflammatory bowel disease rather than from dedicated celiac disease models. It will therefore be critically important for future research to validate that similar pathways are operative in gliadin-induced barrier dysfunction, and that tofacitinib’s inhibition of JAK1/3 produces comparable effects in this specific setting. Preclinical studies using human intestinal organoids derived from celiac disease patients would provide a robust platform to assess the impact of tofacitinib on STAT phosphorylation, MLCK expression, and the preservation of tight junction proteins like ZO-1 and occludin under gluten challenge conditions (Sayoc-Becerra et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; Yang & Xie, 2021, pp. 4–7).

In summary, the repurposing of tofacitinib for celiac disease is underpinned by a strong mechanistic rationale. Its ability to inhibit JAK1/3-mediated signaling cascades—the very pathways that lead to STAT1/3 activation and subsequent MLCK upregulation, culminating in tight junction disassembly—positions it as an attractive candidate for preserving intestinal barrier integrity in response to gluten-triggered inflammation (Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 25–26; Coskun et al., 2013, pp. 2–3). The clinical precedent set by its use in rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, as well as promising case reports in refractory celiac disease, further bolster the case for its evaluation in this context (Grewal et al., 2022, p. 1; Lenfant et al., 2023, pp. 2–3). Nevertheless, significant challenges remain, including the need for dedicated preclinical and clinical studies to ascertain the efficacy, optimal dosing, and long-term safety of tofacitinib in the celiac disease population. Addressing these gaps will be essential in determining whether tofacitinib can be effectively repurposed to protect the gastrointestinal barrier and modulate the aberrant immune response in celiac disease. Overall, while there is a compelling scientific foundation supporting the potential of tofacitinib for repurposing in celiac disease, the current evidence base is preliminary and warrants further investigation in targeted studies before its therapeutic application in this indication can be definitively endorsed (Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 13–16; Spalinger et al., 2021, p. 14; Shah et al., 2023, pp. 4–5).

Aspergillus niger prolyl endopeptidase (AN-PEP),"Proposal for Aspergillus niger prolyl endopeptidase (AN-PEP)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Aspergillus niger prolyl endopeptidase (AN-PEP) is an enzyme isolated from the food‐grade fungus Aspergillus niger. It belongs to the class of prolyl endopeptidases—proteolytic enzymes that selectively cleave peptide bonds at the carboxyl side of proline residues, which is a critical property when targeting gluten proteins. Gluten, particularly in its gliadin fractions, contains multiple proline-rich regions that are resistant to normal gastrointestinal proteases. AN-PEP was originally discovered and characterized for its application in food processing; for example, it has been employed in brewing to prevent chill haze formation by degrading barley‐derived, proline‐rich proteins (Akeroyd et al., 2016; Mitea et al., 2008). As a naturally derived fungal enzyme, its designation as food-grade confers an advantage in safety relative to enzymes of bacterial origin. Enzymes of this class have long been used in various industrial applications to digest recalcitrant proteins and peptides, and their adaptation to oral therapy leverages their capacity to function under acidic conditions, similar to those of the human stomach (Gass & Khosla, 2007; Cafiero et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
AN-PEP has been evaluated extensively in preclinical studies and early-phase human trials as a digestive aid, particularly to reduce the immunogenic potential of gluten peptides in individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Clinical trial data from studies such as those registered under NCT00810654 and NCT04788797 have investigated the enzyme’s effectiveness when administered orally with gluten challenges, providing evidence that the enzyme can degrade gluten in vivo (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). In addition, previous biochemical studies have confirmed that AN-PEP degrades gliadin peptides—including the notoriously immunogenic 33‐mer—under simulated gastrointestinal conditions (Mitea et al., 2008; Brzozowski et al., 2020). Although its primary historical use has been in the food and brewing industries, enhancing product quality by reducing haze or bitterness (Akeroyd et al., 2016), these same properties have prompted investigation into its repurposing as an orally administered therapeutic candidate for celiac disease. While several clinical trials have shown that AN-PEP has good tolerability when used in gluten challenge studies, efficacy endpoints such as mucosal protection and symptom alleviation have varied across studies (Cafiero et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, AN-PEP functions by cleaving peptide bonds at the carboxyl side of proline residues. This specificity is essential because immunogenic fragments of gliadin, particularly the 33‐mer peptide, are highly enriched in proline and glutamine residues. These peptides resist degradation by conventional gastrointestinal proteases like pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin, thereby surviving intact to stimulate T cell responses in genetically predisposed individuals with celiac disease (Janssen et al., 2015; Mitea et al., 2008). AN-PEP, however, exhibits optimal activity in the acidic pH range similar to that of the stomach (approximately pH 4–5), and it is resistant to inactivation by pepsin. This enables it to efficiently attack the structure of gluten before it reaches the small intestine, where the peptides would normally interact with antigen-presenting cells and trigger an immune response (Gass & Khosla, 2007; Dunaevsky et al., 2021). Furthermore, emerging preclinical studies suggest that treatment of gliadin with AN-PEP prior to epithelial exposure prevents measurable reductions in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and occludin mislocalization in ex vivo organoid models. Such damage is typically mediated by the zonulin pathway, in which immunogenic gluten peptides disrupt tight junction integrity to induce paracellular leakage and subsequent inflammatory cascades (Durham & Ince, 2024; Brzozowski et al., 2020). Hence, by reducing the burden of intact, immunotoxic peptides, AN-PEP is hypothesized to lower zonulin-mediated barrier disruption and downstream inflammatory responses.

Expected Effect:
Based on its biochemical profile and the preclinical data available, the expected therapeutic effect of AN-PEP in celiac disease is two-fold. First, by degrading immunogenic gliadin peptides—including the 33-mer fragment—AN-PEP is expected to decrease the number of peptides that can trigger immune responses after crossing the epithelial barrier. This degradation should result in a marked reduction in T-cell activation and the subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby mitigating the intestinal inflammation characteristic of celiac disease (Janssen et al., 2015; Mitea et al., 2008). Second, the preservation of gut barrier integrity is anticipated via preventing zonulin release. In ex vivo organoid barrier assays, the pre-treatment of gliadin with AN-PEP prevented the decrease in TEER and abnormal localization of tight junction proteins such as occludin—a mechanism indicative of barrier protective effects (Durham & Ince, 2024; Brzozowski et al., 2020). In clinical contexts, even subtle breaches in barrier integrity can lead to enhanced antigen penetration and subsequent immune cascade activation. Therefore, the enzyme’s rapid kinetics and its compatibility with the gastric environment mean that, when taken orally, it should be able to pre-digest gluten molecules in the stomach, reducing the exposure of the small intestinal epithelium to intact immunogenic fragments. Consequently, this reduced exposure is expected to blunt the activation of HLA-DQ2/DQ8-restricted T cells and lower the overall production of inflammatory mediators, ultimately contributing to a decrease in mucosal damage and associated symptomatology in celiac patients (Mitea et al., 2008; Ge & Chen, 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
AN-PEP represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for celiac disease based on its well-characterized enzymatic properties, robust preclinical data, and favorable safety profile in early human trials. One of the greatest strengths of AN-PEP is its specificity for proline-rich immunogenic peptides—chief among them the 33‐mer from gliadin—which are central to celiac disease’s pathogenesis. Its optimal activity in acidic conditions ensures that it performs effectively in the stomach, where conventional human proteases fail, thereby intercepting gluten before it can trigger downstream immune responses (Gass & Khosla, 2007; Mitea et al., 2008). Additionally, the enzyme’s prior use in the brewing and food industries underlines its safety profile, while clinical trial data in gluten challenge studies have demonstrated that AN-PEP is well tolerated when administered to humans (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008). Evidence from ex vivo organoid models further supports the hypothesis that AN-PEP not only detoxifies gluten peptides but also protects the gut barrier from disruption, potentially preventing zonulin-mediated leakage and reducing subsequent inflammatory cascades (Durham & Ince, 2024; Brzozowski et al., 2020).

However, several challenges remain. First, while the enzyme’s biochemical characteristics and rapid action in vitro are promising, clinical endpoints in celiac studies have been variable. Some clinical trials report that although AN-PEP efficiently degrades gluten, it has yet to demonstrate consistent reductions in mucosal damage or clinical symptoms in larger patient populations (Cafiero et al., 2024; Scalvini et al., 2025). Second, the efficacy of AN-PEP may be influenced by the complexity of food matrices; while controlled in vitro models (such as the TIM system) indicate effective gluten degradation, the digestion of realistic meals with variable compositions may require careful optimization of dosing regimens (Mitea et al., 2008; Janssen et al., 2015). Third, the direct link between gluten degradation by AN-PEP and downstream effects on tight junction integrity or modulation of zonulin-mediated barrier disruption—while supported by ex vivo data—still demands further clinical validation, including studies that correlate enzyme activity in the stomach with measures of intestinal permeability and inflammatory biomarkers in vivo (Durham & Ince, 2024; Brzozowski et al., 2020).

In summary, the overall strengths of AN-PEP for treating celiac disease lie in its targeted enzymatic activity, its ability to operate under gastric conditions, and its excellent safety profile demonstrated in prior food and clinical studies (Mitea et al., 2008; Gass & Khosla, 2007). Its mechanism of directly cleaving the immunogenic gluten peptides before they can interact with the intestinal epithelium addresses a key pathogenic step in celiac disease. Nonetheless, its clinical utility will ultimately depend on its ability to demonstrate meaningful improvements in mucosal healing and symptom reduction in larger, well-designed clinical trials. Presently, while the biochemical and ex vivo evidence is robust, comprehensive clinical endpoints—including long-term effects on gut barrier integrity and downstream inflammatory responses—remain to be definitively established. Therefore, AN-PEP is a promising candidate that warrants further detailed clinical investigation but also requires careful optimization of dosing and formulation to ensure that its potent gluten-degrading activity translates into tangible clinical benefits for patients with celiac disease (Turck et al., 2017; Dunaevsky et al., 2021).

Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347,"Proposal for Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 is a live probiotic strain isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract that has been investigated as a potential live biotherapeutic for celiac disease. As a naturally occurring bacterium in the healthy gut, it exemplifies the class of probiotic microorganisms generally used to restore or modulate the gut microbiota. Its selection stems from its well‐characterized genomic repertoire—including genes potentially involved in butyrate production and mucin adhesion—and its capacity to interact with the host immune system. Probiotic candidates like this belong to a larger class of natural therapeutic compounds that have historically been used to support gut health, ameliorate dysbiosis, and modulate immune responses in gastrointestinal disorders. Previous research has focused on beneficial effects from related strains in restoring gut microbial balance in pediatric and adult populations, and the GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) status of these bacteria further supports their clinical feasibility (Olivares et al., 2014; Pellicano & Fagoonee, 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 has a documented history in both preclinical and clinical settings, primarily in its use for celiac disease, a disorder characterized by an abnormal immune response to gluten. In animal models of gliadin-induced enteropathy—mimicking aspects of celiac disease—it has demonstrated the ability to modulate pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production, restore altered intestinal morphology, and significantly alter immune cell populations (Laparra et al., 2012). In human clinical settings, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in children with newly diagnosed celiac disease who, while on a gluten-free diet, received daily supplementation of B. longum CECT 7347. The study reported beneficial outcomes in terms of improved growth parameters (e.g., greater height percentile increase), reductions in harmful bacterial groups such as Bacteroides fragilis, and modulation of immune markers such as decreased peripheral CD3+ T lymphocytes and reduced fecal secretory IgA levels (Olivares et al., 2014; Pellicano & Fagoonee, 2020). Although most of these trials focused on immune and microbiota outcomes rather than direct measures of tight junction integrity or zonulin levels, the cumulative therapeutic history provides a strong rationale that this strain can affect key components linked to celiac pathogenesis.

Mechanism of Action:
Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 exerts its effects through several interrelated molecular and cellular mechanisms. Preclinical studies have demonstrated its capacity to modulate the immune response in gliadin-induced enteropathy models. Mechanistically, it appears to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α while enhancing anti-inflammatory mediators like IL-10. This transformation in cytokine milieu is accompanied by shifts in the T-cell populations; specifically, reductions in inflammatory CD3+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes and increases in regulatory T-cell populations have been observed (Laparra et al., 2012; Pellicano & Fagoonee, 2020). In vitro studies indicate that B. longum CECT 7347 can degrade gliadin peptides, thereby reducing their immunotoxicity and potentially attenuating the stimulus for chronic inflammation (Chander et al., 2018). There is also evidence from animal investigations that this strain influences the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) signaling pathway, which is a central mediator of inflammation. Furthermore, its genome encodes putative pathways involved in the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, known to enhance intestinal barrier function by serving as an energy source for colonocytes and by reinforcing tight junction proteins. Although direct evidence on SCFA production by CECT 7347 in vivo has not been explicitly measured in human trials, related studies in similar strains from the B. longum species support this possibility (Mills et al., 2023). Additional in vitro data using epithelial cell models have shown that exposure to gliadin results in disrupted transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and mislocalization of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), a tight junction protein; treatment with B. longum CECT 7347 has been reported to partially restore TEER and normalize ZO-1 distribution, suggesting that it secretes soluble factors that act to reinforce epithelial barrier integrity (Martorell et al., 2021). These collective molecular interactions position B. longum CECT 7347 as a potential agent to restore barrier integrity by reducing gliadin-induced intestinal permeability via modulation of zonulin regulation and tight junction assembly.

Expected Effect:
Based on the mechanistic insights, the expected effect of administering B. longum CECT 7347 in patients with celiac disease is multifold. First, by modulating the gut microbiota and reducing pathogenic bacterial populations—specifically targeting increases in groups like Bacteroides fragilis—the probiotic is anticipated to reduce microbial-driven inflammatory signals, thereby indirectly contributing to improved gut barrier function (Olivares et al., 2014; Pellicano & Fagoonee, 2020). Second, increased SCFA production, whether directly by the strain or through shifts in the microbial ecosystem, would support epithelial integrity by reinforcing the assembly and function of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1. This biochemical environment is also expected to lower zonulin release—a critical modulator of tight junction permeability that is implicated in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (Rossi et al., 2023). Third, protective soluble factors or metabolites secreted by B. longum CECT 7347 may counteract the inflammatory cascade triggered by gliadin ingestion, thus attenuating gliadin-induced permeability. In preclinical models, administration of the strain has been associated with a reduction in IL-6 and TNF-α and an increase in regulatory cytokines, thereby creating an immunological milieu conducive to barrier recovery (Laparra et al., 2012; Chander et al., 2018). In cellular assays—such as those employing Caco-2 and HT-29 epithelial cells—the probiotic is expected to increase TEER, restore imbalances in zonulin expression, and enforce tight junction integrity, all of which collectively reduce gliadin-induced permeability (Martorell et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
The evaluation of B. longum CECT 7347 as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease is promising, though not without areas warranting further investigation. Strengths of this candidate include its well-documented safety profile; it is a GRAS microorganism with prior human clinical trials that have demonstrated tolerability in pediatric populations with celiac disease (Olivares et al., 2014; Pellicano & Fagoonee, 2020). Its documented immunomodulatory effects in animal models—where it attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles and reversed aspects of gliadin-induced intestinal damage—provide a strong mechanistic rationale for its use (Laparra et al., 2012). The potential to modulate the gut microbiota, reduce pathogenic bacterial overgrowth, and thereby effect improvements in the epithelial barrier offers additional therapeutic promise, particularly when considering the role of dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (Olivares et al., 2014; Pellicano & Fagoonee, 2020). The hypothesis that B. longum CECT 7347 may also increase SCFA production aligns with known properties of Bifidobacterium strains in general, although direct evidence in the context of celiac disease remains limited to preclinical and in vitro models (Mills et al., 2023).

Weaknesses or gaps in the current evidence include the relative paucity of direct human data specifically correlating B. longum CECT 7347 administration with measurable increases in SCFA levels, explicit reinforcement of tight junction proteins, and quantifiable reductions in zonulin levels. Although animal and in vitro studies are supportive, clinical endpoints in human trials have so far focused on immune parameters and growth metrics rather than direct molecular markers of barrier integrity (Pellicano & Fagoonee, 2020; Olivares et al., 2014). Furthermore, the heterogeneity of study designs, small sample sizes, and short intervention durations in available trials may limit the conclusiveness of the data regarding long-term effects on gut permeability and clinical symptomatology in celiac disease. It is also not entirely clear whether the pathways for butyrate (or other SCFA) production are fully active in B. longum CECT 7347 or require a synergistic microbial community that is affected by gluten-free diet adherence. Future research would need to include mechanistically oriented clinical studies that directly measure outcomes such as TEER, zonulin levels, and SCFA profiles along with clinical markers of celiac disease activity.

Overall, though, Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 exhibits significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease. Its ability to modulate the immune response, restore a healthier microbial balance, and potentially reinforce the epithelial barrier through effects on SCFA production and tight junction integrity makes it a compelling candidate for further investigation. Its established safety profile combined with promising preclinical mechanistic data recommends it for additional, well-powered clinical trials with emphasis on direct measures of intestinal permeability and barrier integrity. This integrative approach could help delineate the full therapeutic impact of B. longum CECT 7347 as an adjunctive therapy in celiac disease, especially in patients who continue to experience barrier dysfunction and low-grade inflammation despite adherence to a gluten-free diet (Chander et al., 2018; Laparra et al., 2012; Pellicano & Fagoonee, 2020).

4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA),"Proposal for 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) is a synthetic, low‐molecular‐weight fatty acid derivative originally developed as an alternative ammonia scavenger for urea cycle disorders. It has since been discovered to function as a chemical chaperone that restores protein homeostasis by assisting in proper protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Chemically, 4-PBA is a straight‐chain fatty acid substituted at the para position with a phenyl ring, which confers properties that enable it to interact with misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. It belongs to the class of therapeutic compounds known as chemical chaperones, which have been used broadly in the treatment of protein misfolding disorders, metabolic conditions, and certain neurodegenerative diseases. Historically, this class of compounds has been employed to ameliorate conditions in which excessive ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) contribute to cellular pathology. 4-PBA’s ability to reduce ER stress by facilitating correct protein conformational maturation places it in a unique category of repurposed drugs already approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for rare metabolic indications such as urea cycle disorders (Kolb et al., 2015).

Therapeutic History:
The clinical use of 4-PBA spans several decades, beginning with its role as a treatment for urea cycle disorders where its ammonia‐scavenging properties provided clinical benefit. Subsequent to its initial approval, extensive research established its chemical chaperone abilities, which led to preclinical and early clinical explorations concerning its use in other protein misfolding disorders. For example, 4-PBA has been investigated in conditions such as cystic fibrosis to rescue misfolded membrane proteins like the ΔF508 mutant of the CFTR channel, and in metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, where its ability to attenuate ER stress contributed to improvements in insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; Kolb et al., 2015). It has also undergone dose‐ranging and safety studies in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington’s disease, where doses up to 15 g/day were found to be tolerated (Iannitti & Palmieri, 2011). Although 4-PBA has not yet been approved for the treatment of celiac disease or other autoimmune gastrointestinal disorders, its mechanism of reducing ER stress has been extensively explored in diverse cellular contexts, including enterocytes exposed to gliadin peptides. Preclinical investigations, such as those by Monzani and colleagues, have highlighted a potential application in celiac disease by demonstrating that ER stress plays a key role in disrupting tight junction protein folding and trafficking in intestinal epithelial cells (Monzani, 2022). Overall, the historical clinical use and preclinical evidence in relevant models support further in‐depth investigation of 4-PBA as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, 4-PBA acts primarily as a chemical chaperone by binding to exposed hydrophobic regions of nascent or misfolded proteins within the ER, thereby stabilizing their conformation to favor proper folding and trafficking. This mechanism reduces the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins that typically trigger the UPR. Under normal conditions, ER folded‐protein homeostasis is maintained by endogenous chaperones such as BiP/Grp78; however, when misfolding exceeds the folding capacity of the ER, ER stress sensors including PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 become activated. Persistent activation leads to upregulation of pro‐apoptotic transcription factors such as CHOP and spliced XBP1 (XBP1s), which are hallmarks of an overwhelmed UPR (Kolb et al., 2015; Monzani, 2022). By alleviating protein misfolding, 4-PBA has been shown to significantly reduce the expression of ER stress markers including CHOP and XBP1s. This attenuation not only prevents UPR‐mediated apoptosis but also mitigates the inflammatory cascades that are exacerbated by sustained ER stress. In addition, 4-PBA’s ability to restore proper protein folding extends to complex protein structures such as tight junction proteins—including zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin—which are essential for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. In enterocytes, under the assault of gliadin peptides, ER stress can disrupt the normal folding, trafficking, and localization of these tight junction proteins, leading to increased gut permeability (Monzani, 2022; Kolb et al., 2015). The chemical chaperone activity of 4-PBA enables it to prevent the aggregation and premature degradation of these crucial proteins, thereby facilitating their proper insertion into the cell membrane and supporting intact tight junction complexes. Additionally, studies in cellular models have suggested that 4-PBA can also exert mild histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory effects, which may contribute to the modulation of gene expression profiles relevant to the ER stress response (Kolb et al., 2015). This complex interplay of biochemical actions makes 4-PBA an attractive candidate for repurposing in diseases like celiac disease, where epithelial barrier integrity is compromised due to chronic ER stress and inflammation (Monzani et al., 2025b).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for deploying 4-PBA in celiac disease is predicated on the compound’s capacity to ameliorate ER stress in enterocytes exposed to gliadin peptides. In experimental models where gliadin peptides induce ER stress in intestinal organoids or enterocyte cell lines such as Caco-2 cells, the expected effect of 4-PBA is a significant reduction in the expression of UPR markers, including CHOP and spliced XBP1, which are typically elevated following gliadin stimulation (Monzani et al., 2025a; Monzani, 2022). Concomitantly, by restoring normal ER homeostasis, 4-PBA is anticipated to improve the folding, trafficking, and cellular localization of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 and occludin. This restoration is expected to be measurable by improved transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in in vitro assays, indicating reduced barrier leak—a critical determinant of disease progression in celiac disease (Monzani, 2022). Given that enterocytes inherently express these tight junction proteins, successful chemical chaperone intervention would likely demonstrate an increase in the levels and proper localization of ZO-1/occludin, thereby enhancing barrier function. Moreover, the improved barrier integrity would be expected to reduce the translocation of luminal antigens and decrease downstream inflammatory responses that contribute to the autoimmune pathology observed in celiac disease. Indeed, some preclinical models using gliadin‐challenged tissues have shown that interventions mitigating ER stress correlate with normalization of TG2 and CFTR expression, further underlining the interconnected nature of ER stress and epithelial barrier integrity (Monzani, 2022; Monzani et al., 2025a). In summary, the expected effect of 4-PBA in this context is a multi‐faceted improvement: reduced ER stress markers, enhanced expression and proper folding of tight junction proteins, increased TEER, and ultimately, a stabilization of the epithelial barrier that may prevent the immune cascade implicated in celiac disease pathogenesis.

Overall Evaluation:
The repurposing of 4-PBA as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease is supported by a robust foundation of biochemical rationale, preclinical evidence, and a favorable clinical safety profile. Its strengths include its well‐documented chemical chaperone properties that make it effective in reducing ER stress—a pivotal event in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The compound has an established history of use in related disorders, including urea cycle disorders, cystic fibrosis, and metabolic syndromes, and has been shown to modulate ER stress markers such as CHOP and XBP1s, restore proper protein folding, and assist in the maturation and trafficking of proteins like CFTR and tight junction components (Kolb et al., 2015; Monzani, 2022). Recent preclinical experiments in gastrointestinal models further support that 4-PBA can restore epithelial barrier function, an outcome of critical importance for managing celiac disease (Monzani, 2022; Monzani et al., 2025a). The compound’s oral bioavailability and FDA‐approved status in other indications enhance its appeal as a candidate for rapid repurposing, potentially accelerating the translation of preclinical findings into clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007).

Nonetheless, there are weaknesses that require careful consideration. Despite the strong preclinical evidence, direct clinical data on the use of 4-PBA in celiac disease or even in similar autoimmune gastrointestinal conditions are still limited. The repurposing effort would benefit from focused studies in gliadin‐exposed human enterocyte models to quantitatively assess improvements in tight junction integrity using endpoints such as TEER and precise quantification of UPR markers (Monzani, 2022; Monzani et al., 2025b). Additionally, while the safety profile in urea cycle disorders is established, potential off‐target effects that could be deleterious in the context of chronic administration in celiac disease patients must be rigorously evaluated. Dosing strategies that are effective in reducing ER stress without causing toxicity will also need to be optimally determined given that high doses of 4-PBA have been associated with side effects in other clinical contexts (Iannitti & Palmieri, 2011). Moreover, the heterogeneity of celiac disease pathogenesis and the involvement of other immunological pathways demand that 4-PBA be integrated into combination therapy strategies rather than serving as a standalone treatment. Finally, the translational gap between in vitro organoid models and clinical efficacy in patients remains a challenge that will necessitate well‐designed clinical trials with appropriate endpoints.

In conclusion, 4-Phenylbutyric acid stands out as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of celiac disease. Its ability to restore ER proteostasis, reduce UPR activation, and potentially normalize tight junction protein folding and trafficking targets a fundamental pathogenic mechanism in celiac disease—epithelial barrier dysfunction. The preclinical data across multiple models indicate that 4-PBA can effectively mediate these effects, and its established safety, oral bioavailability, and FDA‐approved status for other indications provide a solid foundation for its further investigation. Given these strengths and the identified areas for further study, 4-PBA merits additional preclinical and early‐phase clinical evaluation focusing on its effects in gliadin‐induced ER stress models and its capacity to restore intestinal barrier integrity in celiac disease conditions (Monzani, 2022; Kolb et al., 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008). These efforts will be critical in determining whether the promising mechanistic data can be successfully translated into therapeutic benefit for patients with celiac disease.

Lactobacillus casei ATCC 9595,"Proposal for Lactobacillus casei ATCC 9595

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Lactobacillus casei ATCC 9595 is a probiotic strain isolated from natural fermentation sources, typically found in dairy products, and belongs to the broader class of lactic acid bacteria. As a live biotherapeutic agent, it is a naturally derived microorganism rather than a synthetically produced compound. Probiotics such as L. casei have been historically used to promote gastrointestinal health and restore microbial balance in the gut, and their “secretome” – the collection of low molecular weight bioactive metabolites and peptides secreted by the bacterium – is of particular interest for therapeutic applications. This candidate falls within the live biotherapeutic product (LBP) class that has been previously explored for various gastrointestinal disorders, where the aim is to modulate the microbiome and enhance the intestinal barrier function (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Marasco et al., 2020, p. 5). These agents are typically produced via controlled fermentation processes, and their formulation can include live bacteria, heat-killed cells, or filtered culture supernatants containing the secretome; in the case of L. casei ATCC 9595, its secreted bioactive molecules are hypothesized to mediate its beneficial effects. The use of live microbes as therapeutics has gained traction owing to their favorable safety profiles and the ability to exert local effects in the gut, including barrier stabilization and immunomodulation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Lactobacillus casei strains, as a class, have been extensively studied and applied in both preclinical and clinical settings for a variety of gastrointestinal conditions. Their use ranges from preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea to modulating inflammatory conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Several studies have evaluated the impact of Lactobacillus species on intestinal barrier function and microbiota composition, and L. casei ATCC 9595 itself has been implicated in models where it preserved transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and prevented abnormal localization of tight junction proteins in Caco-2 cell monolayers (Samak et al., 2021, pp. 2–4; Marasco et al., 2020, p. 5). Although dedicated clinical trials solely focused on L. casei ATCC 9595 in celiac disease remain limited, related clinical investigations and multi-strain formulations including Lactobacillus casei have been evaluated in celiac patients, particularly in the context of co‐morbid IBS symptoms (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2012). Preclinical studies in animal models have further provided evidence that Lactobacillus casei can modulate immune responses and improve mucosal architecture following gliadin exposure, which is a central pathological trigger in celiac disease (Wagh et al., 2022, pp. 8–9; Catassi et al., 2024, p. 9). Thus, the historical use of Lactobacillus casei and its safety profile in both human and veterinary contexts underpins its consideration as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease.

Mechanism of Action:
The proposed mechanism by which Lactobacillus casei ATCC 9595 might exert its therapeutic effect in celiac disease is predicated on its secretome’s capacity to downregulate key intracellular signaling pathways involved in tight junction regulation and inflammatory responses. Gliadin peptides, upon ingestion, are known to trigger a cascade of events in the intestinal epithelium that lead to disassembly of tight junctions. This process is largely mediated by the activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and protein kinase C alpha (PKCα), resulting in the phosphorylation of tight junction proteins such as occludin and ZO-1, and leading to increased paracellular permeability (Ghodsi et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Orlando et al., 2014, pp. 11–12). Preclinical investigations using Caco-2 cell models have demonstrated that exposure to gliadin can lead to a decline in TEER and a redistribution of tight junction proteins away from their typical intercellular localization. L. casei ATCC 9595 is hypothesized to counteract these deleterious effects by secreting bioactive metabolites that inhibit the overactivation of MLCK and PKCα pathways. By limiting the phosphorylation of tight junction components, the secretome supports the maintenance of barrier integrity under gliadin challenge (Samak et al., 2021, pp. 12–14; Zhai et al., 2019, p. 8).

More specifically, the secreted peptides and metabolites may interact directly with epithelial cells, interfering with the intracellular signaling cascades triggered by gliadin. These interactions likely involve modulating the activity of kinases that govern cytoskeletal dynamics; for example, a reduction in MLCK activity would attenuate actomyosin contraction, a central process in tight junction disassembly. Likewise, affecting PKCα activity could stabilize the arrangement of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 and occludin, thereby preserving the epithelial barrier’s function (Samak et al., 2021, pp. 12–14; Orlando et al., 2014, pp. 8–10). This hypothesis is supported by evidence in which L. casei and other Lactobacillus species have demonstrated the capacity to sustain TEER and prevent tight junction protein delocalization under various stress conditions, albeit most of the available data specifically pertain to osmotic or inflammatory stress rather than gliadin-induced epithelial disruption (Orlando et al., 2014, pp. 8–10; Samak et al., 2021, pp. 7–10).

Furthermore, while direct clinical evidence for Lactobacillus casei ATCC 9595 modulating MLCK or PKCα in the context of gliadin exposure is sparse, the collective body of literature suggests that these pathways are critical for barrier disruption in celiac disease. This provides a strong translational rationale whereby the secretome of L. casei ATCC 9595 could exert a protective, stabilizing effect on the epithelial barrier by reducing pro-inflammatory kinase activation and preserving the normal architecture of tight junctions. It is also noteworthy that probiotics are known to modulate immune responses by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and interferon-gamma, which further contributes to maintaining barrier integrity (Ghodsi et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Marasco et al., 2020, pp. 3–5).

Expected Effect:
In the highly controlled assays proposed, such as those utilizing Caco-2 cell monolayers to mimic the human intestinal epithelium, L. casei ATCC 9595 is expected to manifest its effects primarily by preserving barrier integrity. Under gliadin challenge, the typical response is a marked decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and a consequent redistribution of key tight junction proteins like occludin and ZO-1 away from the cell membrane into the cytoplasm. The expected effector function of the L. casei secretome is a mitigation of these events; in other words, the therapeutic should maintain normal TEER values and ensure that proteins such as ZO-1 remain appropriately localized at the intercellular junctions (Samak et al., 2021, pp. 12–14; Orlando et al., 2014, pp. 11–12).

At the molecular level, the inhibition of MLCK and PKCα activation by constituents of the secretome should theoretically translate to a reduction in gliadin-induced phosphorylation events that lead to tight junction disruption. This would not only preserve physical barrier properties but also reduce the epithelial cell exposure to gliadin peptides — a central pathophysiologic step in the development of celiac disease-related mucosal inflammation (Zhai et al., 2019, p. 8; Marasco et al., 2020, p. 5). Moreover, if L. casei ATCC 9595 diminishes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines as part of a broader immunomodulatory effect, the anticipated result would be an overall decrease in local inflammatory responses and improved mucosal homeostasis, which are crucial for alleviating the epithelial injury observed in celiac disease (Wagh et al., 2022, pp. 8–9).

Given that gliadin-induced epithelial permeability is central to celiac disease pathogenesis, the preservation of tight junction integrity and epithelial barrier function by L. casei ATCC 9595 could serve as a complementary therapeutic strategy alongside a gluten-free diet. The underlying hypothesis posits that when applied in a clinical scenario, this probiotic could reduce the translocation of immunogenic gluten peptides, thereby ameliorating downstream immune activation and mucosal damage (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Marasco et al., 2020, p. 5). In vitro assays using human intestinal cell lines like Caco-2, along with animal models of gliadin-induced enteropathy, are expected to yield a demonstrable protective effect that correlates with improved barrier function and reduced inflammatory signaling, as measured by standard assays such as TEER, immunofluorescence for junctional protein localization, and kinase activity assays.

Overall Evaluation:
Lactobacillus casei ATCC 9595 emerges as a promising live biotherapeutic candidate for the treatment of celiac disease based on its favorable safety profile, established use as a probiotic in gastrointestinal disorders, and mechanistic actions that align well with the pathophysiology of celiac disease. One of the primary strengths of this candidate is its natural origin and extensive precedent as a probiotic agent that has been safely administered in various clinical and preclinical studies. The ability of its secretome to interfere with key intracellular signaling cascades implicated in tight junction disruption—specifically via the downregulation of MLCK and PKCα activation—addresses a critical aspect of celiac disease pathology, namely the gliadin-induced “leaky gut” phenomenon (Samak et al., 2021, pp. 12–14; Orlando et al., 2014, pp. 11–12).

Furthermore, supportive evidence from in vitro studies using Caco-2 models has demonstrated that similar Lactobacillus strains are capable of preserving transepithelial electrical resistance and maintaining the correct localization of tight junction proteins under stress conditions. This provides a strong rationale for expecting that L. casei ATCC 9595 could mitigate the epithelial barrier disruption induced by gliadin, with subsequent beneficial effects on mucosal immunity and inflammation (Zhai et al., 2019, p. 8; Marasco et al., 2020, p. 5).

However, several weaknesses and gaps remain that warrant cautious interpretation. While the mechanistic data obtained from related studies are robust, direct evidence focusing specifically on L. casei ATCC 9595 in the context of gliadin-induced epithelial damage is still sparse. Many of the cited studies assess osmotic or inflammatory stress rather than the unique challenge posed by gliadin peptides, and the extrapolation of these findings to celiac disease must be validated through targeted biochemical assays and animal model studies. Additionally, although the safety profile of Lactobacillus casei as a probiotic is well established, specific clinical trial data evaluating its efficacy for celiac disease remain limited, with most studies focusing on multi-strain formulations rather than the ATCC 9595 strain alone (Wagh et al., 2022, pp. 8–9; Seiler et al., 2020, pp. 9–10; Catassi et al., 2024, p. 9).

In summary, the strengths of Lactobacillus casei ATCC 9595 lie in its established use as a probiotic, its mechanistic potential to reduce MLCK and PKCα activation thereby preserving epithelial barrier integrity, and its overall favorable safety profile. The weaknesses reside in the relative paucity of direct preclinical and clinical data specifically addressing its effects in celiac disease, particularly concerning gliadin-induced permeability and downstream immune activation. Consequently, while the candidate is biologically plausible and mechanistically promising, additional rigorous studies—both at the in vitro and in vivo levels, complemented by well-designed clinical trials—will be essential to fully validate the therapeutic potential of L. casei ATCC 9595 for use in celiac disease (Wagh et al., 2022, pp. 8–9; Seiler et al., 2020, pp. 9–10; Catassi et al., 2024, p. 9).

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG),"Proposal for Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a naturally occurring polyphenol extracted primarily from the leaves of Camellia sinensis (green tea), and it represents one of the most abundant catechins present in this botanical source (Asri et al., 2021). EGCG belongs to the flavonoid family and, more specifically, to the subgroup of catechins that possess a distinctive galloyl moiety along with multiple hydroxyl groups that confer high reactivity and antioxidant capacity (Asri et al., 2021). The compound is isolated routinely using solvent extraction methods that retain its bioactive conformation, and its purity is maintained through chromatographic techniques making it available for both nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications (Asri et al., 2021). Historically, green tea has been used in traditional medicine for centuries because of its health-promoting attributes, including anti‐inflammatory, antimicrobial, and gut‐protective benefits; this traditional use underpins modern interest in EGCG as a therapeutic candidate for various chronic conditions (Asri et al., 2021). EGCG, therefore, falls under the category of naturally derived nutraceutical agents that have been repurposed as potential therapeutic candidates against inflammatory and barrier-disrupting diseases, including those affecting the gastrointestinal tract.

Therapeutic History
The therapeutic history of EGCG is extensive and well documented, as it has been studied in numerous preclinical models addressing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal system. In animal models of colitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), EGCG has demonstrated the capacity to attenuate mucosal inflammation, reduce polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration, and restore normal intestinal architecture, such as villus morphology and crypt depth (Van Buiten, 2017). In vitro studies employing human intestinal epithelial cell lines, such as the Caco-2 model, have reinforced these findings by showing that EGCG increases transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and decreases permeability induced by inflammatory stimuli, indicating its barrier-protective effects (Van Buiten, 2017). Additionally, polyphenol-rich extracts containing EGCG have been investigated for their potential to bind gliadin and modulate its immunogenicity in non-celiac gluten sensitivity; such studies have found that similar polyphenols can reduce cytokine release and improve barrier function (Calabriso et al., 2022). Although EGCG has not yet been directly evaluated in a clinical trial for celiac disease—there are no registered trials on ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—it has been widely used as a dietary supplement for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which supports its safe profile and potential for translational repurposing (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Overall, the accumulated therapeutic history across diverse models of gut inflammation and barrier dysfunction provides a strong rationale for considering EGCG as a candidate for modulating the pathological processes in celiac disease.

Mechanism of Action
EGCG exhibits a complex multifaceted mechanism of action that spans extracellular interactions as well as intracellular signal modulation, offering several therapeutic avenues relevant to celiac disease. One of the key mechanisms involves direct binding with gliadin peptides—the proline- and glutamine-rich fragments derived from gluten that are central to the pathogenesis of celiac disease (Van Buiten, 2017). Studies have shown that EGCG forms non-covalent complexes with these immunogenic peptides via hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, a process that relies on its unique galloyl group and hydroxylation pattern (Van Buiten, 2017). This binding induces a disorder-to-order conformational transition in the gliadin peptides, increasing their helicity and potentially masking key immunogenic epitopes that would normally be presented by HLA-DQ2/8 molecules to T cells (Van Buiten, 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2020). By precipitating gliadin into insoluble complexes, EGCG reduces its bioavailability and limits its capacity to traverse the intestinal epithelium and trigger an immune response.

Beyond this extracellular sequestration of gliadin, EGCG modulates intracellular signaling pathways that are critically involved in inflammation and barrier regulation. One of the most pivotal pathways targeted by EGCG is the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. EGCG has been shown to inhibit IκB kinase (IKK) activity, thereby preventing the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα and inhibiting the subsequent translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus (Asri et al., 2021). Since NF-κB regulates the transcription of a suite of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β, its inhibition by EGCG results in a marked reduction in the inflammatory response (Asri et al., 2021; Schnur et al., 2023). In parallel, EGCG has been observed to attenuate the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling cascade. This pathway, when activated, can lead to phosphorylation events that disrupt the assembly and function of tight junction proteins such as occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1); by inhibiting PI3K/Akt, EGCG helps maintain the proper localization and stability of these proteins (Mathews, 2022; Schnur et al., 2023).

Another intriguing facet of EGCG’s mechanism is its potential to interfere with CXCR3-mediated responses. In celiac disease, gliadin peptides have been reported to interact with the CXCR3 receptor on intestinal epithelial cells, thereby triggering zonulin release. Zonulin, in turn, modulates tight junction disassembly leading to increased gut permeability. Although definitive evidence of EGCG directly competing with gliadin for CXCR3 binding is still emerging, the hypothesis is supported by data showing that EGCG’s binding with gliadin reduces the concentration of free peptides available to engage CXCR3 (Calabriso et al., 2022; Van Buiten & Elias, 2021). This reduction in free gliadin may translate into decreased zonulin secretion, thereby stabilizing the tight junction complex and preserving barrier integrity.

EGCG also exerts an inhibitory effect on digestive enzymes such as pepsin and trypsin. In vitro studies have documented that EGCG can inhibit these proteases in a dose-dependent manner, which further contributes to a decrease in the generation of smaller, more immunostimulatory gliadin fragments (Van Buiten, 2017). The cumulative effect of these biochemical interactions—direct complexation with gliadin, inhibition of key proteases, suppression of NF-κB and PI3K/Akt signaling, and potential interference with CXCR3-mediated zonulin release—creates a therapeutic milieu that is highly pertinent to the pathological mechanisms operative in celiac disease (Asri et al., 2021; Van Buiten, 2017; Mathews, 2022).

Additionally, EGCG possesses potent antioxidant properties that enable it to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitigate oxidative stress, a factor that further contributes to the preservation of cellular structures including tight junction proteins (Ribeiro et al., 2020). The antioxidant action of EGCG not only protects epithelial cells from oxidative damage but also modulates intracellular redox-sensitive signaling pathways such as NF-κB, thereby complementing its anti-inflammatory effects (Ribeiro et al., 2020).

Expected Effect
Based on the multifactorial mechanisms described, EGCG is expected to yield several beneficial effects in experimental models of celiac disease. In an assay employing gliadin-challenged human intestinal epithelial cells or organoids, EGCG should form insoluble complexes with gliadin, substantially reducing the concentration of free, immunogenic peptides available for receptor-mediated uptake (Van Buiten, 2017). Consequently, the decreased availability of gliadin peptides should lead to a reduction in CXCR3 engagement on epithelial cells, thus lowering zonulin release and preventing tight junction disassembly (Calabriso et al., 2022). This would be observable in the form of preserved or enhanced levels of key tight junction proteins, such as occludin and ZO-1, which are central to maintaining epithelial barrier function (Mathews, 2022).

Functionally, the expected outcome in epithelial cell models should include a measurable increase in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), indicating improved barrier integrity, as well as a decrease in paracellular permeability, which can be quantified using standard assays such as FITC-dextran flux (Van Buiten, 2017). At the intracellular level, EGCG is anticipated to reduce the phosphorylation levels of Akt and IKK, correlating with decreased NF-κB activation; this would lead to a lower expression of inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β (Asri et al., 2021; Schnur et al., 2023). Collectively, these outcomes would confirm that EGCG not only structurally sequesters gliadin peptides but also biologically dampens the inflammatory cascade and prevents barrier dysfunction.

In more advanced models such as gliadin-treated intestinal organoids, EGCG is expected to result in a multifaceted protective effect. First, by physically interacting with gliadin, it would reduce the transepithelial transport of immunogenic peptides, as demonstrated by lower concentrations in the basolateral medium (Van Buiten, 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2020). Second, by inhibiting protease activity, EGCG would prevent the creation of smaller immunostimulatory fragments, further minimizing the antigenic load (Van Buiten, 2017). Third, the inhibition of NF-κB and PI3K/Akt signaling by EGCG should be evidenced by reduced phospho-Akt and phospho-IKK levels, translating into lower production of inflammatory cytokines that are typically upregulated in response to gliadin exposure (Asri et al., 2021; Schnur et al., 2023). Finally, the anticipated preservation or restoration of tight junction protein localization at cell–cell contacts would be observable using immunofluorescence imaging techniques, with occludin and ZO-1 maintaining their continuous distribution along the membrane, thereby reflecting intact barrier function (Mathews, 2022). These expected effects, taken together, strongly support the hypothesis that EGCG can ameliorate‐induced permeability and inflammation in celiac disease models.

Overall Evaluation
EGCG emerges from the literature as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease due to its dual mechanism of action that encompasses direct physicochemical sequestration as well as modulation of intracellular inflammatory and barrier-regulatory pathways. One of the primary strengths of EGCG is its ability to bind gliadin peptides through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, forming insoluble aggregates that lower the effective concentration of free immunogenic peptides available for withstanding proteolytic digestion and subsequent receptor engagement (Van Buiten, 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2020). This effect has the potential to not only blunt the early immune triggers in celiac disease but also to diminish the formation of smaller, more immunostimulatory peptide fragments produced during gastrointestinal digestion.

In addition, EGCG’s well-documented inhibitory effects on key intracellular signaling pathways—namely NF-κB and PI3K/Akt—address two critical components of celiac disease pathogenesis: inflammation and tight junction disruption (Asri et al., 2021; Mathews, 2022). The suppression of NF-κB activity results in reduced transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while PI3K/Akt inhibition prevents the pathological phosphorylation events that would otherwise compromise tight junction assembly. These actions are anticipated to synergistically maintain and restore barrier integrity, reducing paracellular leakage and ultimately preventing the translocation of gliadin peptides (Schnur et al., 2023).

Another notable advantage of EGCG is its extensive use in dietary and nutraceutical contexts. As a constituent of green tea, EGCG has been consumed safely by millions over long periods, a fact which supports its safety profile and suggests its suitability for long-term administration as an adjunct therapy for chronic conditions such as celiac disease (Asri et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Its existing preclinical efficacy in models of inflammatory bowel disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity further strengthens the argument for its repurposing given the shared pathophysiological features related to inflammation and epithelial barrier dysfunction.

Nevertheless, several challenges must be considered when evaluating EGCG as a therapeutic agent for celiac disease. A major concern is its bioavailability and stability in physiological environments. EGCG is prone to auto-oxidation and may exhibit low systemic absorption when administered orally, which could result in subtherapeutic concentrations reaching the target site unless innovative formulation strategies, such as encapsulation or nanoparticle delivery, are employed (Schnur et al., 2023). Moreover, while there is a wealth of preclinical data supporting its beneficial effects, direct clinical evidence specifically in celiac disease patients remains lacking, signifying a critical gap that future research must address (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Another potential weakness is the complexity and pleiotropic nature of EGCG’s actions. While its broad spectrum of activity is advantageous in mitigating multiple facets of celiac disease pathogenesis—from gliadin sequestration to the attenuation of inflammatory signaling—the modulation of ubiquitous pathways such as NF-κB and PI3K/Akt raises concerns regarding off-target effects. These pathways are involved in normal cellular processes including immune regulation, cell survival, and metabolism, so systemic inhibition could theoretically result in unintended adverse consequences if not carefully controlled (Asri et al., 2021). In addition, while the hypothesis that EGCG competes with gliadin for binding to CXCR3 to reduce zonulin release is appealing, direct experimental evidence to confirm this specific receptor-level interaction is presently limited (Calabriso et al., 2022; Van Buiten, 2017).

In summary, EGCG represents a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of celiac disease based on its ability to sequester gliadin peptides and modulate key signaling pathways that govern inflammation and epithelial barrier integrity. The evidence from preclinical studies—demonstrating increased TEER, preserved tight junction protein localization, reduced cytokine secretion, and effective inhibition of proteolytic digestion of gliadin—provides a robust scientific justification for further exploration of EGCG in this context (Van Buiten, 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2020; Mathews, 2022).

Moving forward, critical aspects that warrant further investigation include detailed receptor-binding assays to confirm whether EGCG directly interrupts gliadin’s interaction with CXCR3, optimization of its formulation to overcome bioavailability and stability challenges, and rigorous in vivo studies using gluten-sensitive animal models to corroborate the promising in vitro findings. Additionally, a phased clinical trial strategy starting with safety and tolerability assessments in celiac disease patients will be essential before efficacy can be fully evaluated (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall, our comprehensive literature review supports the further investigation of EGCG as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease. Its multifaceted mode of action—including gliadin complexation, NF-κB and PI3K/Akt pathway inhibition, and potential modulation of zonulin release through interference with CXCR3 binding—addresses key pathogenic mechanisms in celiac disease. The compound’s well-established safety profile as a dietary polyphenol, combined with its significant preclinical efficacy in models of gut inflammation and barrier dysfunction, makes it an attractive candidate that merits continued mechanistic studies and preclinical validation (Asri et al., 2021; Van Buiten, 2017; Calabriso et al., 2022).

In conclusion, while challenges remain regarding the translation of EGCG’s preclinical promise into clinical success—particularly issues of bioavailability, stability, and off-target effects—the detailed mechanistic insights and extensive supportive literature provide a compelling rationale for advancing EGCG into further focused studies. Enhanced formulations and targeted delivery methods may ultimately facilitate the use of EGCG as an adjunctive treatment that improves intestinal barrier function, reduces pro-inflammatory signaling, and mitigates the immunopathological cascade triggered by gliadin in celiac disease. With continued research, EGCG holds considerable promise as a novel, natural, and multi-targeted strategy to complement existing gluten-free dietary approaches and improve clinical outcomes for patients with celiac disease (Van Buiten, 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2020; Mathews, 2022).

Dimethyl fumarate (DMF),"Proposal for Dimethyl fumarate (DMF)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a small molecule originally developed as a synthetic derivative of fumaric acid, a naturally occurring intermediate in the Krebs cycle. Its chemical structure makes it an α,β‐unsaturated carboxylic ester, and its synthesis typically involves either the isomerization of dimethyl maleate via Lewis acid catalysis or the Fischer esterification of fumaric acid with methanol (Manai et al., 2023). DMF belongs to the broader class of fumaric acid esters, a group known for their immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties. Historically, these compounds were first recognized and employed in dermatological applications, most notably in the treatment of psoriasis, due to their ability to modulate the immune response and reduce skin inflammation (Hennig et al., 2018). Over time, the therapeutic use of DMF expanded into neuroinflammatory conditions such as relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), where its mechanism of activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway plays a central role in its efficacy (Hennig et al., 2018; Manai et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Clinically, DMF has received regulatory approval for the treatment of psoriasis and multiple sclerosis because of its robust immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities, which are key in these chronic inflammatory disorders (Hennig et al., 2018; Manai et al., 2023). In multiple sclerosis, it is used as an oral disease-modifying therapy and has shown efficacy in reducing relapse rates while modifying disease progression, likely via its dual mechanism involving both Nrf2-dependent and independent pathways (Polak, 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Although its initial clinical applications were not focused on gastrointestinal diseases, subsequent research has explored its impact on intestinal inflammation and epithelial barrier function. Notably, in preclinical models of gut inflammation—such as chemically induced colitis—DMF has demonstrated the preservation of tight junction proteins and overall barrier integrity (Manai et al., 2023). While DMF has not been directly applied in clinical studies for celiac disease, its documented ability to modulate oxidative stress and inflammation in other settings provides a strong rationale for repurposing it for conditions such as celiac disease, where gluten-induced epithelial barrier disruption is a central pathological feature (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Manai et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
DMF’s biological activity is principally mediated by its activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its inhibitor Keap1 and targeted for ubiquitination. DMF, acting as an electrophilic Michael acceptor, modifies specific cysteine residues on Keap1 through a process known as succination, thereby disrupting the Keap1-Nrf2 complex. This modification permits the stabilization and nuclear translocation of Nrf2, where it binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of target genes (Hennig et al., 2018; Manai et al., 2023). The resultant transcriptional upregulation increases the expression of several phase II detoxifying enzymes—such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC)—which collectively elevate intracellular glutathione levels and bolster the cellular defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Manai et al., 2023; Hennig et al., 2018). In addition, DMF has been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory signaling via NF-κB and interfere with dendritic cell maturation, leading to a shift in T cell responses towards a more regulatory, Th2 profile rather than a pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 profile (Hennig et al., 2018; Polak, 2024). The compound’s dual actions—antioxidant enhancement and anti-inflammatory modulation—offer a comprehensive approach to mitigate tissue damage induced by oxidative stress and chronic inflammation.

Expected Effect in Celiac Disease:
The central hypothesis for repurposing DMF in celiac disease hinges on its ability to activate the Nrf2 pathway in enterocytes, thereby upregulating phase II detoxifying enzymes and reducing oxidative stress-induced modifications that can disrupt tight junction (TJ) proteins. In celiac disease, gliadin peptides trigger a cascade that not only activates pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress but also directly targets epithelial cell junctions, leading to increased intestinal permeability. By upregulating antioxidants such as HO-1 and NQO1, DMF is expected to mitigate ROS production and maintain tight junction proteins like occludin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) in their correct cellular locations (Manai et al., 2023). In vitro assays using gluten-exposed intestinal epithelial cell cultures (for example, Caco-2 cell models) are predicted to show reduced phosphorylation of tight junction proteins—a marker of barrier dysfunction—as a result of the diminished oxidative stress environment fostered by DMF. Furthermore, by attenuating NF-κB and downstream cytokine activation, DMF should lower the inflammatory milieu that exacerbates tight junction disruption under gliadin challenge (Manai et al., 2023; Hennig et al., 2018). This mechanistic premise is reinforced by animal studies in various gut inflammation models, where DMF administration correlated with improved intestinal barrier integrity, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and preserved expression of key tight junction proteins (Manai et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Dimethyl fumarate shows significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease primarily based on its robust activation of the Nrf2 pathway and its established anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. One of the major strengths of DMF lies in its well-characterized mechanism, wherein it increases the expression of cytoprotective enzymes and maintains redox balance within cells. This mechanism is particularly relevant in the context of celiac disease, where oxidative stress contributes heavily to epithelial barrier dysfunction and tight junction disruption (Hennig et al., 2018; Manai et al., 2023). In addition, its previous clinical approval for conditions such as psoriasis and MS means that its human safety profile is already well established, mitigating the risks associated with repurposing and potentially expediting clinical development (Manai et al., 2023; Polak, 2024).

Another strength is DMF’s oral dosing regimen, which could enhance patient compliance, especially considering the chronic nature of celiac disease and the necessity for long-term treatment in non-responsive patients. Preclinical evidence in gastrointestinal models further supports its potential efficacy in maintaining barrier integrity, a critical therapeutic target in celiac disease (Manai et al., 2023). Moreover, given that gliadin-induced oxidative stress and cytokine release are key factors in celiac pathology, DMF’s ability to curtail these processes could translate into meaningful clinical benefits by preventing the disassembly of tight junction proteins and thus maintaining epithelial barrier function.

However, there are also weaknesses and concerns that warrant consideration. While DMF’s mechanism is well elucidated in the context of neurological and dermatological disorders, direct evidence supporting its use specifically in celiac disease is currently limited. The majority of preclinical studies have been conducted in models of colitis and other inflammatory gut disorders rather than in gluten-induced epithelial damage models. Therefore, while the mechanistic rationale is sound, the lack of direct experimental data in gliadin challenge assays or celiac disease-specific preclinical studies represents a significant gap that must be addressed in future research (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Manai et al., 2023).

Another consideration is the potential gastrointestinal side effects linked to DMF’s metabolism. DMF is completely hydrolyzed in the intestine to monomethyl fumarate (MMF) and methanol; while MMF is associated with beneficial effects, the byproduct methanol has been implicated in gastrointestinal irritation. Although lower doses or modified formulations (such as gastro-resistant tablets or related derivatives like diroximel fumarate) have been designed to mitigate these effects, this aspect will require careful optimization in the context of celiac patients, who already suffer from compromised gut barrier function (Manai et al., 2023).

In summary, DMF exhibits multiple strengths that support its repurposing for celiac disease: its well-established mechanism of activating Nrf2 and upregulating antioxidant enzymes aligns directly with the pathological need to counteract gliadin-induced oxidative stress; its clinical history and safety profile in other chronic inflammatory conditions make it a practical candidate; and its preclinical benefits in preserving intestinal barrier integrity provide encouraging, albeit indirect, evidence for efficacy. The primary limitations lie in the need for direct preclinical and clinical studies demonstrating its effects on gliadin-induced tight junction disruption specifically in celiac disease, as well as addressing potential gastrointestinal tolerability issues. Overall, DMF appears to be a promising candidate for celiac disease treatment, but further targeted investigations in appropriate disease models are essential to confirm its efficacy and optimize its formulation for this new indication (Hennig et al., 2018; Manai et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Polak, 2024).

"N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) as a promising repurposed drug candidate for celiac disease, based solely on the available literature and context provided.","Proposal for N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) as a promising repurposed drug candidate for celiac disease, based solely on the available literature and context provided.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is a small, thiol‐containing molecule synthesized by acetylating the naturally occurring amino acid L-cysteine, which both enhances its water solubility and protects it from oxidation (Samuni et al., 2013). This modified cysteine derivative serves as an exogenous source of cysteine for intracellular glutathione (GSH) synthesis, lending NAC a central role as an antioxidant. NAC falls into the general class of antioxidant compounds that have been extensively used in clinical practice as mucolytics, as well as in the treatment of acetaminophen overdose—where replenishment of depleted GSH is critical for detoxification. Over several decades, the chemical synthesis and development of NAC have been thoroughly investigated, allowing its wide clinical adoption and providing a robust pharmacological safety profile (Samuni et al., 2013). Its twofold mechanism—directly scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and indirectly maintaining the intracellular redox balance by restoring GSH—is central to its therapeutic appeal. In addition to its current use in respiratory diseases and overdose scenarios, NAC’s biochemical properties have prompted investigation into its utility in various oxidative stress–related pathologies, including those involving barrier dysfunction in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

Therapeutic History:
NAC’s clinical history is extensive and multifaceted. Initially, it gained prominence as the treatment of choice in acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose, where it effectively replenishes intracellular GSH stores to counteract the toxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine. Its potent mucolytic properties also led to its use in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other lung conditions. Over time, NAC has been explored in a wide array of preclinical and clinical settings for disorders characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation. In animal models of surgical stress, NAC pre‐treatment has been shown to protect intestinal mitochondria, thereby mitigating barrier dysfunction typically induced by surgical manipulation; for instance, in a rat model, NAC improved mitochondrial functionality in intestinal tissues under stress conditions (Heidari et al., 2020). Similarly, in experimental colitis models and inflammatory bowel conditions, NAC has been observed to reduce oxidative damage and inflammatory cytokine release while preserving or restoring tight junction integrity in the intestinal epithelium (Tenório et al., 2021). Although direct use of NAC in celiac disease has not been established in clinical trial databases—as indicated by searches returning no relevant studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—the scientific literature from related gastrointestinal barrier dysfunction conditions supports further evaluation of NAC in this context. Additionally, preclinical studies have demonstrated that NAC can attenuate oxidative stress in various cell types and animal models, including scenarios where epithelial cell apoptosis and tight junction disruptions occur, suggesting its potential applicability in diseases like celiac disease where gliadin peptides induce oxidative injury (Andrade et al., 2015; Lee & Kang, 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, NAC works through several interrelated mechanisms that collectively support its protective effects on cellular homeostasis. First, NAC acts as a direct scavenger of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Its free sulfhydryl (–SH) group is highly reactive, enabling it to neutralize potent oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals, nitrogen dioxide, and thiyl radicals, which otherwise may damage lipids, proteins, and DNA (Samuni et al., 2013). This capacity for radical scavenging helps reduce the overall oxidative burden within cells. Second, NAC is critically important as a precursor for glutathione synthesis. Glutathione, a tripeptide composed of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine, is one of the most important intracellular antioxidants. By providing cysteine—the rate‐limiting amino acid in GSH synthesis—NAC facilitates rapid replenishment of intracellular GSH pools, especially under conditions where oxidative stress is high and endogenous stores are depleted (Andrade et al., 2015).

In many cellular contexts, particularly in the intestinal epithelium, oxidative stress not only leads to direct macromolecular damage but also activates redox-sensitive signaling pathways. For example, heightened ROS production results in the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), both of which play pivotal roles in modulating the phosphorylation status of tight junction proteins, such as occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) (Lee & Kang, 2019). When these kinases become activated, they can disrupt the structure and function of the tight junction complex, leading to increased paracellular permeability. By reducing ROS levels through both direct scavenging and GSH replenishment, NAC can attenuate the aberrant activation of PKC and MLCK. Thus, NAC indirectly helps preserve tight junction integrity and maintains the barrier function of intestinal epithelial cells.

Furthermore, NAC has been shown to exert anti-apoptotic effects. In cell models challenged with inflammatory stimuli (e.g., LPS), NAC treatment results in a significant reduction in the activation of caspase-3, a key executor of apoptosis. For example, studies in both intestinal epithelial cell models and animal models of surgical stress indicate that NAC reduces apoptosis, thereby preserving the viability of enterocytes and contributing to an intact barrier (Gao et al., 2025; Heidari et al., 2020). These multifactorial actions—including radical scavenging, boosting glutathione synthesis, modulation of redox-sensitive kinases, and reduction of apoptosis—underline the potential for NAC to stabilize and protect epithelial integrity under oxidative conditions.

In addition to directly influencing tight junction proteins, NAC’s impact on mitochondrial function is crucial. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a well-known contributor to cellular injury, particularly in stressed tissues. NAC has been observed to protect mitochondrial integrity, thus ensuring that energy production remains sufficient for the maintenance of cellular processes essential for barrier function. This is of particular interest in the context of enterocyte health, where compromised mitochondrial function may exacerbate barrier dysfunction (Heidari et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In celiac disease, ingestion of gluten-containing grains leads to an immune-mediated cascade in which gliadin peptides trigger the release of cytokines and generate significant amounts of ROS. This oxidative stress is implicated in the disruption of tight junction integrity and subsequent barrier dysfunction, which not only allows luminal antigens to access the immune system but also amplifies the inflammatory response. The hypothesis driving the repurposing of NAC in celiac disease is thus multifold:

1. Replenishment of Glutathione Pools: By providing cysteine, NAC is expected to replenish intracellular glutathione stores, thereby boosting the cellular antioxidant capacity. This is particularly relevant in gliadin-exposed epithelial cells, where oxidative stress depletes GSH levels and compromises cellular defenses (Andrade et al., 2015).

2. Scavenging of Reactive Oxygen Species: The free radical scavenging action of NAC should directly lower ROS levels generated as a result of gliadin-induced immune activation and cytokine signaling. By neutralizing these reactive species, NAC would reduce the oxidative damage inflicted upon the proteins that form tight junctions, such as occludin and ZO-1 (Lee & Kang, 2019).

3. Inhibition of Redox-Sensitive Kinases: Through its antioxidative action, NAC is expected to prevent the inappropriate activation of redox-sensitive kinases such as PKC and MLCK, which are known to phosphorylate tight junction components, leading to their dysfunction and internalization. Prevention of such phosphorylation events would help maintain the structural integrity and function of the tight junction complex (Tenório et al., 2021).

4. Preservation of Mitochondrial and Cellular Integrity: NAC’s ability to protect mitochondrial function and reduce apoptosis is also anticipated to play a key role. By reducing caspase-3 activation and preventing enterocyte apoptosis, NAC should contribute to preserving the overall integrity of the intestinal epithelium, thereby limiting the breakdown of the barrier that is a hallmark of celiac pathology (Gao et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2021).

Studies using models of intestinal injury – such as LPS-induced dysfunction in pig intestinal epithelial cells – have demonstrated that NAC can significantly reduce permeability and restore transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), alongside restoring the expression of key tight junction proteins (Lee & Kang, 2019). Such effects in vitro strongly suggest that, when applied to a gliadin challenge in models that mimic celiac disease (e.g., gliadin-exposed Caco-2 or organoid culture systems), NAC should similarly reduce oxidative stress, maintain tight junction integrity, and ultimately help preserve the mucosal barrier. This would theoretically prevent the leakiness of the gut barrier and the downstream exaggerated immune responses that contribute to the pathology of celiac disease (Tenório et al., 2021).

Moreover, by restoring the intracellular redox balance and preventing tight junction protein oxidative modification, NAC could contribute to reducing the chronic inflammation that underlies the mucosal damage seen in celiac patients. Such a reduction in epithelial permeability is crucial because elevated intestinal permeability is considered a predisposing factor not only for the initiation of the immune response in celiac disease but also for its persistence even after the onset of the disease.

Overall, when integrated into in vitro assays and animal models that recapitulate the oxidative and inflammatory stress conditions observed in celiac disease, NAC is expected to demonstrate its multifaceted mechanism: attenuating gliadin-induced ROS generation, maintaining or restoring the expression of occludin, ZO-1, and associated junctional proteins, and safeguarding mitochondrial function to preserve cell viability and barrier function. In this manner, NAC would operate at both the molecular and tissue levels to counteract the deleterious effects of oxidative injury as well as inflammatory signaling activated by gliadin peptides.

Overall Evaluation:
N-Acetylcysteine is a highly attractive candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic for celiac disease. One of its major strengths is its well-documented safety and clinical tolerability; its broad use in treating acetaminophen overdose and as a mucolytic agent attests to this established safety profile. Its dual mechanism of action—serving both as a direct antioxidant by scavenging ROS and indirectly by replenishing intracellular glutathione—addresses the central pathophysiological process implicated in celiac disease, namely, oxidative stress–induced barrier dysfunction (Samuni et al., 2013; Andrade et al., 2015).

Preclinical studies in models of gastrointestinal injury provide compelling evidence that NAC can improve mitochondrial function, diminish apoptosis in epithelial cells, reduce inflammatory cytokine production, and restore the expression of tight junction proteins; for example, improvements in intestinal barrier integrity following surgical or LPS-induced stress have been documented (Heidari et al., 2020; Lee & Kang, 2019). Additionally, in experimental colitis models, NAC has been shown to normalize oxidative biomarkers and enhance the expression of key junctional proteins, suggesting its utility in managing enteropathies with barrier dysfunction components (Tenório et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021).

Mechanistically, NAC’s ability to modulate redox-sensitive kinases such as PKC and MLCK—thereby preventing the phosphorylation events that destabilize tight junction complexes—is particularly relevant in the context of gliadin-induced injury, where oxidative triggers disrupt the normal assembly and function of occludin and ZO-1 (Lee & Kang, 2019; Tenório et al., 2021). Moreover, its anti-apoptotic and mitochondrial protective effects further ensure that the integrity of the epithelial barrier is maintained even under conditions of inflammatory and oxidative stress.

However, certain challenges must be recognized. Firstly, the oral bioavailability of NAC is relatively low because of extensive first-pass metabolism; therefore, achieving the effective concentration in the intestinal mucosa necessary for optimal barrier protection might require modified dosing regimens or alternative routes of administration. Secondly, although numerous preclinical models demonstrate promising results, there is as yet a lack of direct clinical evidence to support the efficacy of NAC specifically in celiac disease—as indicated by clinical trial searches that do not yield studies for NAC in this context (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Thirdly, celiac disease is a complex immune-mediated disorder, and while oxidative stress is an important aspect of its pathogenesis, adaptive immune responses driven by gliadin peptides and HLA-DQ2/DQ8–restricted T cell activation are also central components; it is not yet clear how NAC’s barrier-protective and antioxidative effects will integrate with the immunologic cascade underlying celiac pathology.

Despite these concerns, the comprehensive preclinical evidence—that includes studies demonstrating NAC’s efficacy in protecting intestinal barrier integrity under various provocative conditions (e.g., surgical stress, LPS challenge, chemically induced colitis, and β-conglycinin–induced enteropathy)—provides a compelling rationale for further investigation (Gao et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2021). Its safety profile, long clinical history in other indications, and low cost make it an especially appealing candidate for rapid preclinical evaluation and, eventually, for early-phase clinical trials in celiac disease patients.

In summary, NAC demonstrates a strong mechanistic basis for repurposing in celiac disease. Its expected ability to replenish intracellular GSH, scavenge ROS, inhibit redox-sensitive kinase activation (thereby preserving tight junction protein integrity), and protect mitochondrial function directly addresses key features of oxidative injury and barrier disruption associated with celiac disease pathogenesis. While challenges such as optimal dosing and the translation of animal model outcomes to human pathology remain, the extensive preclinical data from gastrointestinal models provide a compelling framework for moving forward. Further targeted studies, including well-designed in vitro assays using gliadin-exposed human intestinal cell lines (such as Caco-2 cells) and in vivo models that more closely recapitulate the immunological milieu of celiac disease, are warranted. Ultimately, these efforts will help clarify whether NAC can effectively complement the current gluten-free dietary management by restoring epithelial barrier integrity and mitigating downstream inflammatory cascades in celiac patients (Tenório et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021).

Overall, despite some inherent limitations and the need for more direct clinical evidence in this particular disease context, NAC’s multifaceted antioxidant and barrier-protective functions, coupled with its robust safety record, strongly support its further evaluation as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease. Future research should focus on confirming its mechanistic effects on signaling pathways such as PKC and MLCK, and on defining optimal dosing strategies that ensure effective mucosal concentrations in celiac patients. Should these preclinical studies yield positive results, early-phase clinical trials can be designed to evaluate the efficacy of NAC in reducing intestinal permeability and ameliorating symptoms in celiac disease—potentially offering an adjunctive therapy to a gluten-free diet, aimed at improving quality of life in affected patients.

Sodium butyrate,"Proposal for Sodium butyrate

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sodium butyrate is an endogenous short‐chain fatty acid (SCFA) that is primarily produced by colonic fermentation of dietary fiber by the gut microbiota. It is a naturally occurring molecule that can be isolated and formulated as its sodium salt for pharmaceutical and nutritional applications (Baldi et al., 2021). As a member of the SCFA class, sodium butyrate belongs to a group of compounds known for their pivotal role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and barrier function. Historically, SCFAs have been recognized for their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to modulate gene expression via both epigenetic mechanisms and receptor‐mediated pathways. In particular, sodium butyrate is known to act as an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC), which alters chromatin structure and modulates transcriptional activity, and it also signals through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as GPR41 and GPR43, both of which are expressed on intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells (Liu et al., 2021). This class of compounds has been used in various experimental settings to promote epithelial barrier integrity, reduce inflammation, and even combat carcinogenesis in the colon (Feng et al., 2018). The concept behind repurposing sodium butyrate for celiac disease derives from the need to restore the broken epithelial barrier, which is a hallmark of gluten-induced injury in the small intestine, and to modulate the inflammatory environment typical of the disease (Cardoso-Silva et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
Sodium butyrate has been investigated in a number of preclinical studies across different models of gastrointestinal pathology. It was originally studied in the context of colon cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), and conditions associated with epithelial barrier dysfunction, with several studies documenting its beneficial effects on the upregulation of tight junction proteins and its anti-inflammatory properties (Bordin et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2012). Its use in animal models has consistently demonstrated improvements in epithelial barrier integrity as evidenced by increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and reduced paracellular permeability (Wu et al., 2017). Although the direct clinical application of sodium butyrate in celiac disease (CD) has not yet been extensively studied in clinical trials—a fact supported by limited clinical trial data noted in the Clinical Trials Search for “sodium butyrate AND (celiac disease OR gluten)” (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—its extensive use in other gastrointestinal disorders provides a strong foundation for its potential repurposing (Chang et al., 2019). In veterinary medicine, sodium butyrate has been used to improve gut health and enhance growth performance in livestock, further supporting its safety profile in the context of intestinal barrier restoration (Chang et al., 2019). These historical applications, particularly in conditions that share pathophysiological characteristics with celiac disease such as increased intestinal permeability and chronic inflammation, make sodium butyrate a promising candidate for repurposing in CD.

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of sodium butyrate is multifactorial and operates through both receptor-mediated and epigenetic pathways. One of the central mechanisms is its function as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, which leads to the hyperacetylation of histones and subsequent changes in gene expression profiles. This epigenetic regulation results in the upregulation of genes involved in maintaining tight junction integrity, including the transcriptional increase of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 (Bordin et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2012). The transcription factor SP1 has been shown to bind more effectively to the claudin-1 promoter when sodium butyrate is present, which directly drives the expression of key tight junction proteins (Wang et al., 2012). Concomitantly, sodium butyrate exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation, a key mediator of inflammatory responses. By doing so, it lowers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, and although data on IL-15 in this context are less abundant, the cytokine environment in celiac disease is known to include elevated IL-15, and its reduction is hypothesized as part of sodium butyrate’s beneficial effect (Liu et al., 2021). Additionally, sodium butyrate activates GPCRs such as GPR41 and GPR43, which are expressed on both intestinal epithelial cells and certain immune cell subtypes; the activation of these receptors contributes to anti-inflammatory signaling and further supports the reinforcement of the epithelial barrier (Liu et al., 2021; Musaico, 2020). Through these combined mechanisms, sodium butyrate enhances barrier function by increasing the expression and proper localization of tight junction proteins, reducing the inflammatory milieu induced by gliadin exposure, and ultimately promoting mucosal healing in the context of gluten-induced damage (Cardoso-Silva et al., 2019; Drago et al., 2006).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, the expected effect of sodium butyrate when applied in an in vitro or organoid model of gluten-challenged intestinal epithelium involves several interconnected outcomes. First, the treatment should lead to a transcriptional upregulation of tight junction proteins such as claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1, which are essential for maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. Studies have shown that butyrate can significantly increase TEER and reduce paracellular permeability in epithelial cell layers, indicating a restoration of barrier function (Wang et al., 2012; Bordin et al., 2004). Given that gliadin exposure disrupts these proteins—often through mechanisms involving zonulin release and tight junction disassembly (Drago et al., 2006)—sodium butyrate is expected to counteract these effects, thereby normalizing TEER measurements in organoid models or Caco-2 cell assays (Hollon et al., 2015). Second, sodium butyrate is anticipated to reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines, notably TNF-α and IL-15, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. By inhibiting NF-κB and other inflammatory pathways via HDAC inhibition and GPCR activation, sodium butyrate can attenuate the inflammatory response triggered by gliadin peptides (Liu et al., 2021; Musaico, 2020). Third, activation of the GPR41/GPR43 receptors by sodium butyrate contributes to cellular signaling pathways that are involved in promoting epithelial differentiation and maintaining immune homeostasis, ultimately reinforcing the barrier function (Liu et al., 2021; Musaico, 2020). In the context of a gluten challenge, such as in organoid or epithelial cell models, sodium butyrate is hypothesized to restore disrupted tight junction structures, reflected in increased expression and correct localization of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1, while concurrently suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine production that would otherwise exacerbate epithelial damage (Cardoso-Silva et al., 2019; Drago et al., 2006). Additionally, supportive in vitro studies examining wound healing and barrier recovery indicate that butyrate can accelerate repair processes in intestinal epithelial layers, further endorsing its translational potential as a therapeutic agent in celiac disease (Ma et al., 2012).

Overall Evaluation:
Sodium butyrate emerges as a compelling therapeutic candidate for celiac disease based on its multifaceted mechanisms of action and its demonstrated efficacy in enhancing intestinal barrier integrity in various preclinical models. One of the major strengths of sodium butyrate lies in its dual mechanism of action: as an HDAC inhibitor, it modulates gene expression to upregulate critical tight junction proteins, and as a ligand for GPR41 and GPR43, it activates anti-inflammatory signaling pathways. This mechanistic synergy is particularly valuable in celiac disease, where both barrier dysfunction and chronic inflammation drive the pathology (Liu et al., 2021; Bordin et al., 2004). The safety profile of sodium butyrate is further reinforced by its endogenous production in the gut and its historical use in clinical and veterinary settings without major adverse effects (Chang et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Another strength is its translational potential. Sodium butyrate’s documented ability to increase TEER and reduce permeability in in vitro models closely mimics the epithelial dysfunction observed in gluten-challenged intestinal mucosa. Organotypic models, including human intestinal organoids and epithelial cell cultures like Caco-2, have been widely used to assess compounds that promote tight junction reassembly and barrier restoration, thus providing a reliable platform for future experiments with sodium butyrate (Wang et al., 2012; Musaico, 2020). Its role in reducing inflammatory cytokine production—by dampening NF-κB activation—suggests that sodium butyrate will be beneficial in mitigating the inflammatory cascade (especially TNF-α and potentially IL-15) that exacerbates mucosal damage in celiac disease (Liu et al., 2021; Drago et al., 2006).

However, some challenges and weaknesses must also be considered. There is currently a relative paucity of direct clinical or organoid-based data specifically evaluating sodium butyrate in the context of celiac disease. Most of the evidence stems from studies in other inflammatory or intestinal barrier dysfunction models, and while the mechanistic rationale is robust, direct translation into celiac disease therapeutics requires further investigation. Moreover, while sodium butyrate is well tolerated, its pharmacokinetics and bioavailability when administered orally, particularly in the upper small intestine (the primary site of gluten-induced injury in celiac disease), might differ from those in the colon where it is endogenously produced (Baldi et al., 2021; Musaico, 2020). It will also be critical to determine the optimal dosing regimen that achieves therapeutic concentrations in the target tissues without adverse effects. Additionally, while receptor-mediated signaling through GPR41/GPR43 and HDAC inhibition are well documented in other contexts, the interplay of these pathways specifically in gluten-challenged epithelia remains to be thoroughly delineated (Liu et al., 2021; Bordin et al., 2004).

Furthermore, the inflammatory milieu in celiac disease is complex and involves adaptive immune responses to gluten peptides in genetically predisposed individuals. Although sodium butyrate’s anti-inflammatory effects are promising, it remains to be seen whether these effects are sufficient on their own to alter the course of the disease or whether they would need to be used in conjunction with dietary management (i.e., a gluten-free diet) or other immunomodulatory therapies (Drago et al., 2006; Hollon et al., 2015). Finally, long-term studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of sodium butyrate in human subjects with celiac disease are needed to establish its clinical utility.

In summary, sodium butyrate is a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease given its endogenous nature, established safety profile, and dual mechanisms of action via HDAC inhibition and GPCR-mediated anti-inflammatory signaling. The compound’s ability to upregulate tight junction proteins such as claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1, along with its potential to reduce inflammatory cytokine release (notably TNF-α and possibly IL-15), may restore epithelial barrier function in gluten-challenged intestinal tissues. Although further direct testing in celiac disease models—including organoid studies and gluten challenge assays—is necessary, the current body of biochemical and preclinical evidence supports the potential of sodium butyrate as a novel therapeutic option. Its success would complement traditional gluten-free dietary approaches and may offer additional benefits in terms of mucosal healing and inflammatory control, thereby improving patient outcomes in celiac disease (Cardoso-Silva et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2012; Musaico, 2020). Overall, while some uncertainties remain regarding optimal delivery and efficacy in the specific context of celiac disease, sodium butyrate’s multifaceted mechanism and safety profile make it a strong candidate for further translational and clinical evaluation.

Obeticholic acid (OCA),"Proposal for Obeticholic acid (OCA)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a semisynthetic bile acid derivative originally synthesized as a 6-ethyl analogue of chenodeoxycholic acid. It belongs to the class of FXR (farnesoid X receptor) agonists, which are synthetic ligands designed to target a nuclear hormone receptor that is widely expressed in the liver, intestine, and other tissues. The clinical development of OCA began with the intent to harness the potent FXR agonistic activity—approximately 100‐fold greater than that of natural chenodeoxycholic acid—to modulate bile acid homeostasis, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and inflammatory signaling. FXR agonists have been used primarily for cholestatic liver diseases (e.g., primary biliary cholangitis) and metabolic liver disorders such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and their clinical safety profiles are well characterized when administered orally (Ali & Lindor, 2016; Hegyi et al., 2018). As a member of this therapeutic class, OCA combines the favorable pharmacokinetic properties of an orally bioavailable bile acid derivative with the molecular capacity to regulate key genes involved in bile acid synthesis and transport. Its development capitalized on the understanding that FXR plays an essential role not only in liver homeostasis but also in maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity and mucosal immunity (Calzadilla et al., 2022; Mouries et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, OCA has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, demonstrating its ability to alter bile acid metabolism and reduce hepatic inflammation (Ali & Lindor, 2016). In clinical trials such as those investigating OCA for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cholestatic liver diseases, the compound has shown consistent anti‐inflammatory and antifibrotic effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024). Although its primary indication is directed at liver disorders, preclinical studies in rodent models have suggested that FXR agonists, including OCA, can reduce intestinal permeability, enhance tight junction integrity, and modulate immune responses in the gut (Stojancevic et al., 2012; Úbeda et al., 2016). This mechanistic potential provides an intriguing rationale for repurposing OCA in inflammatory and autoimmune gut conditions, such as celiac disease—a disorder characterized by gliadin‐triggered epithelial dysfunction, abnormal zonulin release, and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-15 and TNF-α (Mouries et al., 2019; Ferrari et al., 2021). No clinical data to date have directly evaluated OCA in celiac disease, but multiple analogous disease models—ranging from primary biliary cholangitis to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)—offer supportive evidence suggesting that its barrier‐protective and anti‐inflammatory properties might be beneficial in conditions marked by disrupted mucosal integrity.

Mechanism of Action:
OCA exerts its pharmacologic effects primarily through agonistic binding to the FXR receptor, a ligand‐activated transcription factor that governs expression of numerous genes involved in bile acid synthesis, transport, and metabolism. Upon binding to FXR, OCA prompts the receptor to form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), subsequently binding to FXR response elements (FXREs) in the promoter regions of target genes (Stojancevic et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2018). This activation triggers a cascade that results in the upregulation of genes such as small heterodimer partner (SHP) and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) (Ali & Lindor, 2016), leading to feedback inhibition of bile acid synthesis enzymes like CYP7A1 and increased expression of bile acid transporters such as OSTα/β and BSEP (Guo et al., 2018). In addition to regulating bile acid metabolism, FXR activation by OCA has been shown to upregulate tight junction proteins and other barrier‐protective genes—in experimental models, FXR stimulation has been linked to increased expression of proteins such as claudins, occludin, and ZO-1 (Stojancevic et al., 2012; Úbeda et al., 2016). Moreover, FXR activation confers anti‐inflammatory effects by suppressing the transcription of key proinflammatory cytokines including IL-15, TNF-α, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which are known to orchestrate mucosal immune responses and barrier dysfunction (Ho & Steinman, 2016; Mouries et al., 2019). Biochemical studies suggest that OCA can inhibit pathways leading to excessive zonulin release—an important modulator of tight junction disassembly—thereby potentially reducing gliadin‐induced permeability increases in the gut epithelium (Calzadilla et al., 2022). By reducing the inflammatory milieu and promoting reinforcement of the epithelial barrier, OCA may indirectly attenuate the autoimmune processes that are critical to celiac disease pathogenesis.

Expected Effect:
Based on the proposed hypothesis, OCA is expected to exert several beneficial effects when applied to gliadin‐exposed intestinal epithelial models. First, by activating FXR, OCA should enhance the expression of barrier‐protective genes such as claudin-3 and various mucins, leading to a strengthening of the epithelial tight junctions and a reduction in paracellular permeability. Precedent for this effect comes from studies in which FXR agonists were shown to upregulate tight junction components in rodent models of colitis and cholestatic liver injury (Stojancevic et al., 2012; Úbeda et al., 2016). Second, the compound is expected to suppress the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-15 and TNF-α, as evidenced by reductions observed in inflammatory bowel disease models where FXR activation led to decreased cytokine expression and reduced immune cell infiltration (Mouries et al., 2019; Verbeke et al., 2015). Finally, OCA is hypothesized to mitigate zonulin release, a key step in the disruption of tight junction architecture in gliadin‐induced epithelial dysfunction. Although direct evidence in gliadin‐specific models is limited, related studies have linked FXR signaling to the maintenance of mucosal integrity and modulation of zonulin‐like pathways (Calzadilla et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2023). The overall expected outcome is a restoration of epithelial barrier homeostasis, decreased permeability allowing reduced translocation of luminal antigens, and a dampening of the inflammatory cascade typically observed in celiac disease. This multifaceted mechanism would be of particular significance in gut organoid systems and rodent models of gluten sensitivity, where the normalization of barrier function and suppression of cytokine‐mediated inflammation could translate into improved clinical outcomes.

Overall Evaluation:
The potential of OCA as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease is supported by its well‐characterized pharmacological profile as an FXR agonist, its documented anti‐inflammatory and barrier‐preserving effects, and its favorable safety and oral bioavailability demonstrated in liver disease clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Ali & Lindor, 2016). Strengths of OCA include its potent and selective FXR activation ability, which is central to the regulation of genes controlling bile acid metabolism, epithelial tight junction integrity, and inflammatory responses (Stojancevic et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2018). These properties are directly relevant to the pathogenesis of celiac disease, where gliadin exposure disrupts epithelial barrier function through zonulin release and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-15 and TNF-α (Ferrari et al., 2021; Mouries et al., 2019). Additionally, the extensive preclinical evidence showing that FXR agonists enhance barrier function and reduce inflammatory cytokine levels in models of intestinal injury provides mechanistic support for the hypothesis that OCA could improve outcomes in celiac disease (Calzadilla et al., 2022; Úbeda et al., 2016).

However, there are weaknesses and uncertainties that warrant caution. The current literature does not include direct clinical or experimental studies of OCA in celiac disease models; thus, much of the support is extrapolated from related inflammatory gut disorders and liver disease where barrier dysfunction is prominent (Stojancevic et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2022). While the molecular framework is compelling, it remains to be directly demonstrated whether OCA can reduce zonulin release specifically in gliadin‐exposed epithelium or whether the modulation of FXR activity will fully translate into the restoration of tight junction integrity in this context (Shi et al., 2023; Mouries et al., 2019). There is also the consideration that FXR signaling may have complex tissue‐specific effects, with potential differences in intestinal versus hepatic responses that need to be rigorously delineated (Stojancevic et al., 2012; Úbeda et al., 2016).

Overall, OCA presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in celiac disease owing to its robust FXR agonism, its anti‐inflammatory capacity, and its documented role in enhancing epithelial barrier function in several preclinical models. Its oral bioavailability and established safety profile in the context of liver disease further support its potential for clinical testing in celiac disease. Nonetheless, targeted studies are necessary to investigate its specific effects on gliadin‐induced epithelial dysfunction, including direct assessments of tight junction protein expression (such as claudin-3 and mucins), zonulin release, and the suppression of cytokines like IL-15 and TNF-α in celiac‐specific models. In summary, while significant preclinical evidence and mechanistic reasoning support further research into OCA for celiac disease, early proof‐of‐concept studies in relevant models will be essential to validate its efficacy in this new therapeutic context (Ali & Lindor, 2016; Úbeda et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2022).

Rifaximin,"Proposal for Rifaximin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rifaximin is an oral, non‐absorbable antibiotic that belongs to the rifamycin class and was originally derived from naturally occurring rifamycins produced by Streptomyces species. Its unique chemical structure, achieved through semi‐synthetic modifications, confers it a high degree of stability within the gastrointestinal tract without leading to significant systemic absorption. This class of compounds has been predominantly used to treat gastrointestinal disorders such as travelers’ diarrhea, hepatic encephalopathy, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (DuPont, 2015). Rifaximin’s mechanism has traditionally been understood to rely on the inhibition of bacterial RNA synthesis via binding to the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which accounts for its bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects. More recently, however, its role as a pregnane X receptor (PXR) agonist has emerged as being equally significant; this repurposing phenomenon suggests that beyond reducing bacterial overgrowth, rifaximin may have a direct impact on host epithelial cells by modulating inflammatory signaling and reinforcing gut barrier integrity (DuPont, 2015; Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016). Its established safety profile and clinical use in IBS support its potential repurposing in inflammatory enteropathies such as celiac disease, where the pathogenesis involves both dysbiosis and impaired barrier function.

Therapeutic History:
Rifaximin has an extensive history of clinical use in several gastrointestinal conditions. It has been approved for the treatment of IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) and is widely used in the management of hepatic encephalopathy because of its ability to reduce ammonia-producing bacteria in the gut (DuPont, 2015). Clinical trials such as the one represented by NCT01137955 have evaluated rifaximin in celiac disease patients with persistent symptoms despite adherence to a gluten-free diet, although these trials primarily focused on symptom improvement and the modulation of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) rather than directly assessing improvements in barrier function (Chang et al., 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006). In a placebo-controlled study conducted by Chang and colleagues, rifaximin administration did not yield significant differences in gastrointestinal symptom ratings or lactulose hydrogen breath test results when compared to placebo, suggesting that its benefit in symptomatic celiac disease patients—at least with respect to SIBO-related symptoms—remains unproven (Chang et al., 2011). However, the interest in rifaximin for celiac disease arises from evolving insights into its PXR-mediated effects, previously observed in conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and hepatic conditions where barrier integrity is compromised (DuPont, 2016; Sartor, 2016). While there is no record of rifaximin being used as a frontline treatment for celiac disease itself, its historical use in analogous inflammatory enteropathies and IBS supports the hypothesis that its molecular activities—specifically PXR agonism—could be harnessed for barrier protection in celiac disease.

Mechanism of Action:
The classical mechanism associated with rifaximin is the inhibition of bacterial RNA synthesis by binding to the beta-subunit of the bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thereby exerting bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects in the intestinal lumen (DuPont, 2015). However, recent evidence has highlighted an additional and potentially crucial mechanism mediated by activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor that plays a vital role in the detoxification of xenobiotics and modulation of inflammatory responses in intestinal epithelial cells (Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016; DuPont, 2015). PXR activation by rifaximin leads to a cascade of gene regulatory events that result in upregulation of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, including cytochrome P450 isoforms such as CYP3A4, and the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1). This receptor is also implicated in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity by promoting the expression and proper localization of tight junction proteins, particularly zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-1, both of which are critical for sealing intercellular gaps between enterocytes (Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016; Sartor, 2016).

On a molecular level, PXR agonism initiates a complex interplay between detoxification, anti-inflammatory pathways, and barrier stabilization mechanisms. Rifaximin’s binding to PXR results in suppression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, a central pathway in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α. This downregulation of NF-κB not only reduces inflammation in the gut mucosa but also prevents the cytokine-induced upregulation of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), an enzyme known to disrupt tight junction integrity by promoting cytoskeletal contraction and disassembly of junctional complexes (Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016). In vitro studies using Caco-2 cell monolayers have provided evidence that rifaximin can attenuate cytokine-induced (TNF-α and interferon-γ) increases in epithelial permeability and prevent the relocalization or disruption of ZO-1 (Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016). These findings indicate that rifaximin’s PXR-mediated effect could directly translate to a strengthening of the intestinal barrier.

Furthermore, activation of PXR by rifaximin not only exerts anti-inflammatory effects but may also modulate the composition of the gut microbiota by reducing the adhesion and internalization of pathogenic bacteria while preserving beneficial microbial populations (DuPont, 2015; Weber et al., 2016). By altering microbial virulence and indirectly normalizing the microbiota, rifaximin might decrease the release of pro-inflammatory bacterial products (for example, lipopolysaccharide), further contributing to an improved mucosal environment in inflammatory conditions. Collectively, these molecular interactions position rifaximin as a compound with dual actions: antimicrobial activity on the gut flora and a potent host-directed mechanism via PXR activation, which together may contribute to decreased gliadin-induced permeability in celiac disease (Chang & Green, 2012; Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016).

Expected Effect:
Based on the proposed hypothesis, rifaximin is expected to exert its therapeutic effect in celiac disease through multiple synergistic mechanisms. First, by activating PXR in enterocytes, rifaximin should lead to an upregulation of barrier-protective xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, including CYP3A4 and MDR1, and reinforce tight junction integrity by enhancing the expression and proper localization of ZO-1 and claudin-1. This upregulation is anticipated to result in a direct improvement in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), which is a quantitative measure of barrier function in epithelial monolayers (Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016; Fujimoto et al., 2021). In a gluten-challenge organoid assay that mimics the gliadin-induced disruption seen in celiac disease, rifaximin should reduce the adverse effects of gliadin exposure. Specifically, the drug is expected to decrease the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, while simultaneously mitigating the deleterious effects of gliadin on barrier permeability. This dual action would lead to a sustained TEER and reduced permeability of the enterocyte monolayer (Fujimoto et al., 2021; Sartor, 2016).

In addition, rifaximin’s inherent antimicrobial activity is expected to selectively modulate the gut microbiota, reducing pathogenic bacterial overgrowth and inhibiting bacterial translocation, while sparing or even favoring beneficial commensal species. This is particularly relevant in the context of celiac disease, where dysbiosis is thought to contribute to mucosal inflammation and increased permeability (Chang & Green, 2012; ClinicalTrials.gov). Moreover, given that gliadin exposure in celiac disease can lead to an imbalance in the intestinal microenvironment, rifaximin may also help in normalizing the microbiota composition, thereby reducing the inflammatory load and further protecting the epithelial barrier.

At the cellular level, the expected outcome in a gluten-challenge assay would be the induction of PXR target genes in enterocytes and a corresponding decrease in inflammatory mediators. Data from in vitro models have shown that PXR activation can protect against cytokine-induced barrier dysfunction through inhibition of MLCK expression and reduced phosphorylation of stress signaling kinases such as JNK1/2, which are implicated in tight junction disruption (Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016). Additionally, since gliadin-induced permeability is partly mediated by immune responses that disrupt tight junctions, the anti-inflammatory property of rifaximin—mediated via PXR agonism—would further contribute to preserving barrier function, thereby reducing exposure of the underlying lamina propria to gluten peptides and subsequent immune activation (DuPont, 2016; Sartor, 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
Rifaximin presents several notable strengths as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease, particularly from the perspective of drug repurposing. Its long-established safety profile and current clinical use in treating IBS and hepatic encephalopathy support its potential for application in other inflammatory enteropathies. The dual mechanism of action—comprising both antimicrobial activity and host-directed modulation via PXR activation—is particularly attractive. By activating PXR, rifaximin is expected to enhance the expression of barrier-protective proteins such as ZO-1 and claudin-1 while simultaneously suppressing NF-κB–mediated pro-inflammatory responses (DuPont, 2015; Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016). This is a significant advantage given that celiac disease is characterized by increased intestinal permeability and chronic mucosal inflammation in response to gluten peptides (DuPont, 2015; Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016).

Moreover, although previous clinical trials in refractory celiac disease—such as the one identified under NCT01137955—did not demonstrate significant improvements in patient symptoms or SIBO markers following rifaximin treatment, these studies were primarily focused on symptom relief and did not directly assess the effects on gut barrier function or tight junction protein expression (Chang et al., 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006). Another strength of rifaximin is its localized effect in the gastrointestinal tract due to minimal systemic absorption, which reduces the risk of systemic side effects while concentrating its activity at the site of pathology (DuPont, 2015; Shayto et al., 2016).

On the other hand, there are also several challenges and weaknesses that deserve careful consideration. One major limitation is the mixed clinical data regarding its efficacy in celiac disease populations. The absence of significant symptom improvement in prior trials might indicate that while rifaximin could potentially enhance barrier function, such improvements do not necessarily translate into clinical benefit as measured by conventional symptom scales. This disconnect suggests that additional studies, possibly with modified endpoints that specifically evaluate barrier integrity (for instance, TEER measurements in organoids or mucosal biopsy analyses for tight junction proteins), are required to evaluate its true potential for celiac disease (Chang et al., 2011; Chang & Green, 2012).

Furthermore, the degree to which PXR activation directly influences gliadin-induced changes in permeability remains an open question. The interplay between microbial modulation and PXR-mediated transcription is complex and may vary between individuals. Variability in baseline PXR expression or differences in the genetic background of celiac disease patients could affect the consistency of therapeutic responses. Also, while rifaximin’s antimicrobial action may help correct dysbiosis, the clinical relevance of such microbial changes in the context of celiac disease remains less well established compared to conditions like IBS or IBD (ClinicalTrials.gov; DuPont, 2016).

Additionally, while the evidence supports that rifaximin can reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and improve barrier function in vitro using cell culture models such as Caco-2 cells, there is a need to translate these findings into robust clinical endpoints that matter to patients with celiac disease. The challenge will be designing clinical trials that can capture the nuances of barrier function improvement, possibly by incorporating biomarkers of tight junction integrity and inflammatory mediator levels, in addition to symptom-based endpoints (Chang et al., 2011; Chang & Green, 2012).

In summary, the overall evaluation of rifaximin as a repurposed drug candidate for celiac disease is cautiously optimistic. Its safety record, gut-specific activity, and dual action as both an antibiotic and a PXR agonist make it a promising candidate to target the epithelial barrier dysfunction central to celiac disease pathophysiology. However, previous clinical trials have not shown robust symptomatic benefits, and its impact on barrier-protective mechanisms has not been directly evaluated in celiac disease patients. Rigorous, mechanistically focused studies—such as gluten-challenge organoid assays measuring TEER, PXR target gene induction, and tight junction protein expression—are warranted to better define its potential. Strengths include its established use in other gastrointestinal disorders, its minimal systemic absorption, and its capacity to modulate key inflammatory and barrier-protective pathways. Weaknesses involve the uncertain translation of in vitro benefits to clinical efficacy in celiac populations and the need for more targeted biomarkers to quantify barrier function improvement. Based on the existing literature across biochemical, clinical, and molecular studies (Chang et al., 2011; DuPont, 2015; Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016; Fujimoto et al., 2021; Sartor, 2016), rifaximin merits further investigation as a candidate for modulating gliadin-induced barrier dysfunction in celiac disease, with the specific aim of harnessing its PXR agonism to protect and restore intestinal epithelial integrity.

Spermidine,"Proposal for Spermidine

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Spermidine is an endogenous polyamine that is naturally present in all living organisms and abundantly available in certain dietary sources such as wheat germ, soybeans, and aged cheese. It is synthesized de novo from putrescine through the action of spermidine synthase and belongs to the polyamine class of small organic cations, which are essential for cellular growth, proliferation, and maintenance of homeostasis. Polyamines like spermidine have been extensively studied for their capacity to regulate autophagy—a cellular recycling process that degrades damaged proteins and organelles—in a wide array of organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. The discovery of spermidine’s autophagy-inducing properties emerged from studies on aging, where it was shown to extend lifespan in preclinical models via stimulation of autophagy and reduction of oxidative stress. This compound is typically extracted from natural sources or synthetically refined for experimental application, and its high oral bioavailability coupled with its established preclinical safety profile in aging models renders it an attractive candidate for repurposing in various disease contexts, including celiac disease (Moré & Vandenplas, 2018; Nakamura & Matsumoto, 2025).

Therapeutic History:
Spermidine and its related polyamines have a rich history of investigation in both basic biology and preclinical therapeutic studies. Experimentally, spermidine has been used to modulate autophagy and reduce inflammatory responses in various models of gastrointestinal inflammation, including dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis and T cell transfer models of colitis. Preclinical studies have documented that oral administration of spermidine ameliorates intestinal inflammation by promoting anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization and preserving barrier integrity (Niechcial et al., 2023; Truzzi et al., 2023). Although direct clinical trials in celiac disease are lacking at present, spermidine has been evaluated in healthy aging populations and in studies focused on intestinal barrier parameters, indicating its potential for broader gastrointestinal applications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In various animal models, spermidine supplementation has also been associated with improved outcomes related to proteostasis and mucosal healing, which are processes disrupted in celiac disease. Furthermore, its natural occurrence and dietary availability underscore its potential for safe long-term use, making it a strong candidate for repurposing to address intestinal epithelial dysfunction in celiac disease (Moré & Vandenplas, 2018; Nakamura & Matsumoto, 2025).

Mechanism of Action:
Spermidine’s mechanism of action is multifaceted, involving its well-documented ability to induce autophagy by modulating key regulatory proteins. At the molecular level, spermidine exerts its autophagy-inducing effects primarily through the inhibition of the acetyltransferase EP300, a negative regulator of autophagy, and through the activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), which promotes lysosomal biogenesis and sustains the autophagic process. This leads to an increase in the lipidation of LC3B, a crucial marker for autophagosome formation (Maiuri et al., 2019b; Nakamura & Matsumoto, 2025). In addition, spermidine has been shown to restore proteostasis by facilitating the clearance of damaged or misfolded proteins, thereby reducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR)—both of which are implicated in gliadin-induced cellular damage in celiac disease. On a cellular level, spermidine promotes the stabilization of crucial tight junction proteins, such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin, which are essential for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. This is particularly relevant in the context of celiac disease, where gliadin peptides are known to disrupt tight junctions and increase intestinal permeability (Orlando et al., 2017; Nakamura & Matsumoto, 2025). The compound’s interaction with autophagy machinery results in enhanced turnover of cellular components via autophagosomal and lysosomal fusion, leading to improved barrier function and reduction in inflammatory signaling cascades mediated by factors such as NF-κB. Moreover, by modulating autophagy, spermidine might indirectly influence the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2), further contributing to its anti-inflammatory effects in intestinal epithelial cells (Niechcial et al., 2020). This comprehensive molecular profile positions spermidine as a strong modulator of both proteostasis and barrier function, aligning with the pathological processes observed in celiac disease (Maiuri et al., 2019a; Nakamura & Matsumoto, 2025).

Expected Effect:
In the experimental assays proposed, particularly those involving gliadin-challenged Caco-2 cells, the expected effect of spermidine is to activate the autophagic pathway within intestinal epithelial cells. By enhancing autophagy, spermidine should boost LC3B lipidation, facilitate the clearance of gliadin-induced misfolded or aggregated proteins, and reduce markers of ER stress such as those associated with the unfolded protein response. This increase in autophagic flux is anticipated to preserve the structural organization of tight junction proteins like ZO-1 and occludin, thereby stabilizing the cellular barrier and reducing paracellular permeability—a critical parameter in celiac disease pathogenesis (Nakamura & Matsumoto, 2025; Orlando et al., 2017). The activation of autophagy will likely lead to a downstream decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine production by intestinal epithelial cells, subsequently diminishing the immune-mediated inflammatory cascade triggered by gliadin exposure. In gliadin-challenged in vitro models, one would expect to observe reduced expression of unfolded protein response markers, lower accumulation of damaged protein aggregates, and improved cell viability along with restored barrier integrity, as demonstrated by enhanced transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and reduced FITC-dextran translocation across cell monolayers. Given that proteins involved in autophagic and tight junction regulation, including EP300, TFEB, and LC3B, are expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and have been functionally validated in preclinical studies (Maiuri et al., 2019b; Nakamura & Matsumoto, 2025; Truzzi et al., 2023), spermidine is expected to demonstrate a robust cytoprotective effect in these assays. These protective effects would translate into an overall improvement in intestinal epithelial function and reduced inflammatory signaling, thereby addressing critical aspects of celiac disease pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Niechcial et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Spermidine presents a promising candidate for the treatment of celiac disease based on its established ability to induce autophagy and modulate inflammatory responses. Its natural origin, dietary availability, and excellent preclinical safety record in aging and colitis models underscore its potential for repurposing in this context. A major strength of spermidine is its dual mechanism of action: it not only enhances the autophagic clearance of damaged proteins and organelles induced by gliadin but also supports the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity by stabilizing tight junction proteins. This is crucial in celiac disease, where increased intestinal permeability and chronic inflammation are key features of the pathology. Moreover, its inhibitory effect on EP300 and the consequent activation of TFEB provides a well-defined biochemical pathway that can be directly measured and quantified in preclinical studies (Maiuri et al., 2019b; Nakamura & Matsumoto, 2025).

Nevertheless, there are certain weaknesses that must be considered. Although preclinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of spermidine in models of intestinal inflammation and colitis, there is a relative paucity of direct evidence supporting its application in celiac disease specifically. Most studies have focused on its role in general gut barrier maintenance and in inflammatory bowel disease models rather than in gluten-induced pathology. This means that while the mechanistic rationale is strong, further research specifically investigating spermidine’s effects on gliadin-challenged intestinal models and subsequent clinical trials in celiac disease patients will be necessary to fully validate its therapeutic potential. Additionally, while the autophagy induction by spermidine is well documented, the precise downstream effects on unfolded protein response markers and the stabilization of specific tight junction proteins in the context of celiac disease remain to be fully elucidated. In summary, spermidine offers a compelling therapeutic approach due to its ability to target multiple pathological processes underlying celiac disease, including autophagy impairment, ER stress, and barrier dysfunction; however, future studies must be designed to specifically address these endpoints in celiac disease models and clinical settings (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Niechcial et al., 2023; Truzzi et al., 2023).

Overall, the potential of spermidine in treating celiac disease is supported by a robust mechanistic rationale and strong preclinical evidence from related inflammatory gastrointestinal conditions, though further direct studies are necessary before it can be definitively recommended for clinical use in celiac disease.

AMG 487 (CXCR3 antagonist),"Proposal for AMG 487 (CXCR3 antagonist)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
AMG 487 is a synthetic small‐molecule antagonist that belongs to the quinazolinone (specifically, the 8-azaquinazolinone) class of compounds, which were identified through high-throughput screening approaches and subsequent medicinal chemistry optimization. AMG 487 was discovered by Chemocentryx and later licensed to Amgen, and it has been developed to target CXCR3, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) important in mediating immune cell trafficking and inflammatory responses. As a representative of the chemokine receptor antagonist class, AMG 487 is similar to other small molecules that disrupt ligand–receptor interactions, thereby modulating immune responses. Traditionally, this class of compounds has been explored for their role in attenuating immune cell migration in inflammatory and autoimmune disease models, as well as cancer metastasis, with AMG 487 being the only small molecule CXCR3 antagonist to reach clinical evaluation in conditions such as psoriasis (Pease, 2017; Medina, Johnson, & Collins, 2005). Its chemical synthesis follows conventional routes for development of heterocyclic compounds, leading to high potency due to an optimized structure that yields low nanomolar inhibition of CXCR3 binding to its natural chemokine ligands.

Therapeutic History:
AMG 487 has been studied extensively in the context of inflammation and cancer. Preclinically, it demonstrated potent efficacy in blocking CXCR3-mediated leukocyte migration and reducing inflammatory cell infiltration in animal models. For example, in mouse models of lung inflammation, AMG 487 effectively attenuated leukocyte recruitment induced by CXCR3 ligands and mimicked the phenotype of CXCR3-deficient mice (Pease & Horuk, 2009). In oncology, particularly in models of breast cancer metastasis, AMG 487 was used to pre-treat tumor cells, reducing their metastatic capacity without affecting basic cell proliferation (Walser et al., 2006). Clinically, AMG 487 advanced into Phase IIa trials for psoriasis, a disease where CXCR3-driven T-cell infiltration is a prominent feature; however, it ultimately failed to demonstrate robust efficacy in that indication (Pease, 2017; Andrews & Cox, 2016). Despite its investigative use in these conditions, AMG 487 has not been evaluated in celiac disease specifically, and a search of ClinicalTrials.gov returned no results (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nevertheless, the preclinical data in inflammatory models and the recognized role of CXCR3 in driving immune cell recruitment provide a mechanistic rationale for the repurposing of AMG 487 for celiac disease, particularly given the evidence linking CXCR3 to gliadin-induced zonulin release and enterocyte dysfunction in celiac pathology (Lammers et al., 2008; Medina, Johnson, & Collins, 2005).

Mechanism of Action:
CXCR3 is a chemokine receptor that binds the ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, which are typically upregulated by interferon-gamma during inflammatory responses. When these ligands bind to CXCR3 expressed on T cells, and notably on the luminal surface of enterocytes in the intestine, they initiate a signaling cascade that involves coupling to G proteins and subsequent recruitment of the adaptor protein MyD88. This signaling cascade has been implicated in the release of zonulin, a protein that modulates the assembly of tight junctions and thus regulates paracellular permeability (Lammers et al., 2008; Monzani, 2022). AMG 487 functions as a competitive antagonist by binding to the CXCR3 receptor with high affinity (IC₅₀ ~8 nM) and blocking the interaction of its natural ligands. In doing so, AMG 487 prevents the receptor from activating downstream G protein-coupled pathways, thereby abrogating the recruitment of MyD88 that normally occurs in response to gliadin peptides. This blockade is expected to inhibit the subsequent zonulin release, ultimately preserving the integrity of tight junctions between enterocytes. At the molecular level, the antagonist binding site is located within the transmembrane region of CXCR3, which is critical for its ability to transduce signals upon chemokine binding (Pease, 2017; Nedjai et al., 2015). The metabolic and pharmacokinetic properties of AMG 487—such as its oral bioavailability and the generation of active metabolites—further complement its mode of action by ensuring that sufficient antagonist concentrations can be achieved systemically to block CXCR3 effectively (Mladic et al., 2015; Pease, 2017).

Expected Effect:
Based on the central hypothesis, blocking the CXCR3 receptor on enterocytes with AMG 487 is anticipated to interrupt the pathological signaling cascade induced by gliadin peptides in celiac disease. In assay systems such as gliadin-challenge organoid cultures, AMG 487 should prevent the recruitment of MyD88 downstream of CXCR3 activation. This inhibition is expected to block the release of zonulin, thereby preserving the localization and function of tight junction proteins such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin. The preservation of these tight junction components would maintain transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and reduce FITC-dextran flux, which are standard measures of barrier integrity (Lammers et al., 2008; Monzani, 2022; Khaleghi et al., 2016). In this assay, enterocytes or intestinal organoids treated with gliadin peptides typically exhibit increased paracellular permeability due to zonulin release; however, if AMG 487 is effective, the expected outcome would be a marked reduction in zonulin secretion and a corresponding maintenance of tight junction organization. This, in turn, would lead to improved intestinal barrier function, reducing the translocation of immunogenic gluten peptides. Since CXCR3 expression is increased in the intestinal mucosa of active celiac disease patients and is linked to the pathological cascade triggered by gliadin, the inhibition of CXCR3 by AMG 487 could indirectly reduce mucosal inflammation and immune cell recruitment. Such effects would be particularly important in a disease where even subtle defects in barrier integrity can lead to significant immune activation and tissue damage (Monzani, 2022; Khaleghi et al., 2016; Machado, 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
The therapeutic candidate AMG 487 presents several compelling strengths for repurposing in the treatment of celiac disease. One of its major strengths is its high potency as a CXCR3 antagonist, with documented low nanomolar inhibitory concentrations on receptor–ligand interactions (Pease, 2017; Medina, Johnson, & Collins, 2005). This potency is crucial given that effective blockade of the CXCR3 receptor is necessary to prevent the gliadin-induced signaling cascade that leads to zonulin release and tight junction disruption. Moreover, the fact that AMG 487 has been previously evaluated in clinical trials (albeit in psoriasis) provides an important foundation for its safety and tolerability in humans (Pease, 2017; Andrews & Cox, 2016). Its oral bioavailability further enhances its appeal, as an orally administered agent is highly desirable for chronic conditions like celiac disease, where long-term treatment compliance is key (Pease, 2017; Mladic et al., 2015).

Biochemically, the mechanism of CXCR3 antagonism is well validated by both preclinical and biochemical studies. The receptor is known to play a critical role in mediating gliadin-induced zonulin release via MyD88-dependent signaling, which is directly linked to tight junction disassembly in enterocytes (Lammers et al., 2008; Monzani, 2022). By blocking this pathway, AMG 487 theoretically has the potential to maintain intestinal barrier integrity and reduce paracellular permeability—a finding that would be highly advantageous in the management of celiac disease. Furthermore, preclinical animal models and in vitro assays in other inflammatory contexts have demonstrated the efficacy of CXCR3 antagonists in reducing immune cell migration and inflammatory responses (Pease & Horuk, 2009; Walser et al., 2006).

However, there are also notable weaknesses and uncertainties regarding the application of AMG 487 to celiac disease. Despite its promising profile in other disease models, AMG 487 has not been directly evaluated in clinically relevant celiac disease models, and no trial data exist from either clinical trials or robust preclinical studies in this specific indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The mechanistic hypothesis, while logical, extrapolates from the known role of CXCR3 in gliadin-induced signaling; however, enterocyte-specific effects and the complex interplay of zonulin release and tight junction regulation in the context of a gluten challenge remain to be rigorously demonstrated. Additionally, prior clinical studies in psoriasis have shown that despite favorable pharmacokinetics and safety data, the compound did not meet efficacy endpoints, which may raise questions about its overall effectiveness in modulating immune responses in chronic inflammatory conditions (Pease, 2017; Andrews & Cox, 2016). Furthermore, potential issues related to metabolic liabilities—such as the formation of reactive metabolites and interactions with CYP3A4—could complicate dosing and long-term safety in a patient population that might require chronic therapy (Mladic et al., 2015; Pease, 2017).

Nonetheless, the approach of targeting the CXCR3 pathway represents an innovative therapeutic strategy that directly addresses a key pathogenic mechanism in celiac disease—the disruption of intestinal barrier function due to zonulin release. As our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of celiac disease deepens, particularly in relation to the CXCR3–MyD88 signaling axis in enterocytes, AMG 487 offers a targeted intervention that could complement existing treatments based on gluten avoidance and barrier preservation (Lammers et al., 2008; Machado, 2023; Khaleghi et al., 2016).

In conclusion, while AMG 487 is not yet proven in the context of celiac disease, its well-characterized mechanism, favorable oral bioavailability, and prior human safety data position it as a promising candidate worth pursuing in exploratory preclinical models of celiac disease. Critical next steps include the execution of gliadin-challenge organoid assays and animal models that recapitulate the celiac pathology, with careful attention to measuring endpoints such as zonulin secretion, TEER, and tight junction protein localization. Should these studies yield positive results, subsequent clinical evaluation in celiac patients would be warranted. Overall, AMG 487 represents a scientifically sound and innovative approach to modulating a key pathogenic process in celiac disease; however, further dedicated studies are required to confirm its efficacy and safety in this new therapeutic context (Pease, 2017; Monzani, 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Resveratrol,"Proposal for Resveratrol

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound primarily isolated from grapes, red wine, berries, and peanuts, first discovered for its antioxidant properties in the context of cardiovascular protection and aging research (Dias, 2020). It belongs to the stilbene class of compounds and has been widely studied as a nutraceutical agent, with many preclinical studies demonstrating its pleiotropic effects on cellular metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress (Yu et al., 2022). Resveratrol is typically obtained by plant extraction rather than chemical synthesis, and its natural occurrence in dietary sources has spurred interest in its therapeutic potential due to a generally favorable safety profile and broad bioactivity across many organ systems (Wang et al., 2022). Its utilization as a potential therapeutic candidate has emerged from extensive screening of dietary polyphenols that modulate cell signaling pathways involved in inflammatory processes and barrier homeostasis (Calabriso et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Resveratrol has a long history of investigation across biochemical, clinical, and veterinary research and has been used extensively for conditions ranging from metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases to neurodegenerative disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Several clinical trials have evaluated resveratrol’s efficacy in modulating systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction in humans, with dosing studies demonstrating that oral supplementation up to 500 mg/day, and even higher doses up to 3 g/day, are generally safe and well tolerated (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008). Although there are no large-scale clinical trials in celiac disease per se, resveratrol has been evaluated in related conditions characterized by intestinal barrier dysfunction and inflammation, including ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (Mayangsari & Suzuki, 2018). In addition to clinical trials addressing metabolic and cardiovascular endpoints, several preclinical studies have documented resveratrol’s capacity to enhance intestinal barrier integrity by preserving tight junction proteins and mitigating inflammatory cytokine production, suggesting its translational potential for celiac disease and gluten-induced enteropathy (Yu et al., 2022). There is also evidence from polyphenol research that the broader class—including compounds such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and tannins—has been explored for their ability to sequester gliadin and attenuate immune activation in celiac context, which supports the rationale of repurposing resveratrol despite limited direct clinical studies in celiac patients (Van Buiten & Elias, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
Resveratrol exerts its biological effects primarily by activating Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), two critical regulators of cellular redox status and inflammatory responses (Ye et al., 2023). Upon activation, SIRT1 deacetylates the p65 subunit of NF-κB, thereby suppressing its transcriptional activity and leading to reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β, which are key mediators in intestinal inflammation (Ren et al., 2019). Simultaneously, resveratrol stimulates the Nrf2 pathway, which facilitates the transcription of antioxidant response element (ARE)-driven genes including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and other detoxifying enzymes that help to counteract oxidative stress in enterocytes (Wang et al., 2022). In addition to its effects on these transcription factors, resveratrol has been shown to influence the expression of tight junction proteins such as occludin and claudin-4 and may suppress the induction of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), an enzyme that when overactivated disrupts epithelial barrier integrity by increasing paracellular permeability (Yu et al., 2022). The molecular interactions involve direct modulation of cell signaling cascades that link intracellular redox state to inflammatory signaling, and the consequent restoration of normal tight junction architecture results in improved transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and maintenance of mucosal barrier function under gliadin challenge (Mayangsari & Suzuki, 2018).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay using celiac organoids or intestinal epithelial cell lines, resveratrol is expected to activate SIRT1 and Nrf2 pathways, thereby reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine production elicited by gluten-derived peptides such as p31-43 and IL-15/TNF-α (Yu et al., 2022). This activation is hypothesized to result in decreased expression of MLCK, which in turn should stabilize tight junction proteins like claudin-4 and occludin, restore proper junctional assembly, and normalize TEER measurements, all indicating an improvement in barrier integrity (Calabriso et al., 2022). The mechanism of action is further supported by data showing that resveratrol treatment in preclinical models leads to significant reductions in pro-inflammatory mediators, decreased cell apoptosis, and improved antioxidant enzyme activity in intestinal tissues (Yu et al., 2022). Given that enterocytes express high levels of SIRT1 and relevant tight junction proteins, the anticipated outcome is that resveratrol will mitigate gluten-induced barrier disruption and ameliorate inflammatory damage in celiac disease, providing a rationale for its use as an adjunctive therapy (Wang et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, resveratrol presents as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for celiac disease due to its well-characterized molecular action in activating SIRT1 and Nrf2 pathways, which are critical for counteracting oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling in intestinal epithelial cells (Ye et al., 2023). Its capacity to downregulate NF-κB activity, suppress cytokine-driven MLCK induction, and enhance the expression of tight junction proteins translates into a robust mechanistic basis for restoring barrier integrity under gluten challenge (Calabriso et al., 2022). One of the key strengths of resveratrol is its extensive human safety data demonstrated through clinical trials in metabolic and cardiovascular conditions, and its natural derivation from dietary sources further supports its favorable safety and tolerability profile (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015, 2018). Moreover, the preclinical evidence from models of ulcerative colitis and gut inflammation consistently shows that resveratrol can improve intestinal barrier function, reduce proinflammatory cytokines, and restore normal gut homeostasis, which are central pathologic features in celiac disease (Mayangsari & Suzuki, 2018; Yu et al., 2022).
However, there are some weaknesses to note: direct clinical studies in patients with celiac disease are currently lacking, and despite its known oral bioavailability, resveratrol’s rapid metabolism may limit its effective concentration at the intestinal epithelium unless optimized formulations are developed (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2013, 2012). Additionally, while the modulatory effects on tight junction proteins and MLCK are promising, further mechanistic studies in celiac disease-specific models are needed to fully validate the expected outcomes (Calabriso et al., 2022). In summary, resveratrol—owing to its multifaceted mechanism of action, established safety profile, and preclinical efficacy in restoring barrier integrity—represents a feasible and attractive candidate for repurposing as a barrier-protective agent in celiac disease, provided further direct clinical and mechanistic validations are pursued (Dias, 2020; Ye et al., 2023).

Curcumin,"Proposal for Curcumin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Curcumin is a bioactive polyphenolic compound most commonly extracted from turmeric (Curcuma longa), a spice with a long historical usage in traditional medicine, particularly within Ayurvedic practices. It was first isolated as a yellow pigment from turmeric rhizomes and later characterized as 1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione (also known as diferuloylmethane) (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 1–3). Belonging to the polyphenol and flavonoid family, curcumin has been historically used for its presumed anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities. This class of compounds has seen extensive investigation not only in preclinical biochemical assays but also as dietary supplements and even as adjunctive therapy in clinical interventions for various diseases. Curcumin’s natural origin and its historical use as a spice and a traditional remedy offer a compelling basis for drug repurposing initiatives because its safety profile is well established and it has been incorporated into numerous oral formulations (Natalucci et al., 2021, pp. 11–12; Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 3–4).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of curcumin spans several decades and includes its investigation in multiple inflammatory, metabolic, and neoplastic conditions. Biochemically, curcumin has been shown to attenuate inflammatory cytokine production, reduce oxidative stress, and modulate intracellular signaling pathways associated with chronic inflammation. Clinical studies have explored its efficacy in conditions such as ulcerative colitis, cancer adjunct therapies, arthritis, and metabolic syndrome. Although it has been extensively studied in preclinical models—in which it has been demonstrated to restore epithelial barrier function via modulation of intracellular signaling—it has not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials specifically targeting celiac disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In related gastrointestinal disorders, such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity and inflammatory bowel diseases, there are promising data on the use of polyphenols including curcumin; for example, in co-culture models and animal studies, curcumin has been reported to limit gliadin-induced inflammatory responses and restore tight junction integrity (Calabriso et al., 2022, pp. 15–17; Calabriso et al., 2022, pp. 14–15). Moreover, its use in ulcerative colitis—in which its combination with standard therapy produced superior results to standard therapy alone—suggests that the immunomodulatory and barrier-protective properties of curcumin have translational potential in many gut inflammatory conditions (Calabriso et al., 2022, pp. 14–15; Natalucci et al., 2021, pp. 28–30).

Mechanism of Action:
From a molecular standpoint, curcumin’s mechanism of action is multifaceted. One major mechanism is its potent inhibition of the Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. Activation of the NF-κB pathway is a well-known driver of inflammatory responses; upon activation, NF-κB translocates into the nucleus where it promotes the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukins (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6), and adhesion molecules (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 11–12; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 15–16). By inhibiting IκB kinase (IKK) phosphorylation, curcumin prevents IκB degradation, thereby blocking NF-κB nuclear translocation and subsequent gene transcription. This results in a downregulation of inflammation-related gene expression and attenuation of inflammatory cascades. Curcumin has also been reported to inhibit Protein Kinase C (PKC), particularly affecting the PKC isoforms involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and tight junction integrity (Unknown Reference; Panwar et al., 2021, pp. 11–12). In the context of enterocytes, PKC plays an important role in mediating actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in response to inflammatory stimuli such as gliadin peptides. Gliadin has been shown to trigger zonulin release—a modulator of tight junction (TJ) integrity—via PKC-dependent pathways, resulting in disassembly of tight junction complexes including proteins such as occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) (Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 8–9; Cilla et al., 2015, pp. 1–4). Curcumin’s inhibition of PKC activity can thus prevent such downstream effects. Additionally, curcumin has been observed to increase the expression and proper localization of TJ proteins in intestinal epithelial cells (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 4–6; Wang et al., 2017, pp. 23–33). Its ability to restore the assembly and function of these junctional proteins is critical for maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. Furthermore, curcumin is known to act as an antioxidant by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and upregulating cellular antioxidant defenses, which contributes to the stabilization of the cell membrane and TJ complexes. Together, these mechanisms—NF-κB inhibition, PKC modulation, and antioxidant effects—explain how curcumin can counteract gliadin-induced zonulin release, thwart actin cytoskeletal disruption, and preserve or even restore the expression of occludin and ZO-1 (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 7–9; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 8–9).

Expected Effect:
Given the hypothesis that curcumin will modulate PKC and NF-κB pathways in enterocytes, the expected result in in vitro assays (for example, in gluten-challenge Caco-2 cell models or organoid systems) is a notable reduction in gliadin-induced zonulin secretion and improved epithelial barrier function. Specifically, curcumin is anticipated to reduce the inflammatory response triggered by gliadin, thereby inhibiting the downstream release of zonulin—a key mediator that disrupts tight junction complexes. By curtailing zonulin release, curcumin should prevent the disassembly of the tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1. Evidence from several studies suggests that in models of intestinal permeability, administration of curcumin leads to an upregulation of TJ proteins and attenuation of paracellular leakage (Leech et al., 2019, pp. 9–10; Wang et al., 2017, pp. 14–18). Moreover, by inhibiting NF-κB activation, curcumin can decrease the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, which are known to further disrupt TJ integrity through phosphorylation cascades and cytoskeletal rearrangement (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 9–10; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 15–16). In turn, this cascade leads to a reduction in epithelial permeability and restores a healthier barrier function. In addition, since PKC signaling contributes to actin rearrangement that destabilizes junctional complexes, its inhibition by curcumin is expected to prevent the cytoskeletal alterations associated with gliadin exposure (Panwar et al., 2021, pp. 11–12; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 8–9). Together, these effects should be measurable by a decrease in trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) loss and an improvement in barrier function markers in the cell culture models. The expression levels of occludin and ZO-1 can be assessed via immunocytochemistry or Western blot analysis to determine the restorative impact of curcumin on tight junction assembly (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 4–6; Wang et al., 2017, pp. 23–33).

Overall Evaluation:
There is compelling scientific rationale for considering curcumin as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease based on its molecular activities and extensive safety history. One of the biggest strengths of curcumin is its well-documented safety profile; decades of usage as a dietary supplement in humans across various populations underscore its tolerability and potential for long-term use (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 1–3; Natalucci et al., 2021, pp. 11–12). Moreover, its ability to target multiple inflammatory pathways simultaneously is highly advantageous in a multifactorial disorder such as celiac disease, which is characterized by aberrant immune responses to gluten as well as disruption of intestinal barrier function. The dual action on NF-κB and PKC pathways offers a mechanistic basis for dampening the inflammatory milieu triggered by gliadin peptides while preserving or restoring tight junction proteins such as occludin and ZO-1 (Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 15–16; Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 4–6).

Nevertheless, there are significant challenges and weaknesses that need to be acknowledged. One of the primary concerns is the notoriously poor oral bioavailability of curcumin due to its low aqueous solubility and rapid first-pass metabolism. This pharmacokinetic limitation has often dampened enthusiasm in translating preclinical efficacy to clinical outcomes, despite numerous formulation strategies being developed to address this issue—from nanoparticle encapsulation to phytosomal formulations (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 3–4; Natalucci et al., 2021, pp. 28–30). Additionally, while preclinical models provide a robust foundation for its use in gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions, there is currently no direct clinical trial evidence that curcumin alone can ameliorate celiac disease symptoms (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This lack of specific clinical evidence particularly in celiac cohorts means that while the mechanistic hypothesis is strong, translation into clinical benefit remains to be confirmed. Furthermore, like many naturally derived compounds, curcumin may have batch-to-batch variability and potential issues with standardization that could complicate its development as a consistent and reliable pharmaceutical agent.

From a mechanistic perspective, curcumin’s ability to modulate NF-κB activation is well supported in the literature. It prevents the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB, thereby reducing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and subsequent transcription of pro-inflammatory genes (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 11–12; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 15–16). Simultaneously, curcumin’s modulation of PKC signaling is important for maintaining cytoskeletal stability and tight junction integrity, particularly under conditions of gliadin-induced stress (Panwar et al., 2021, pp. 11–12; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 8–9). These actions collectively contribute to its capacity to reduce zonulin release and restore the adhesive properties of tight junction proteins, thereby maintaining or re-establishing the intestinal barrier—a critical need in celiac disease pathology. The preclinical data from various in vitro models, including Caco-2 cell lines and organoid systems, provide supportive evidence that curcumin can impact epithelial barrier function by improving the expression and organization of occludin and ZO-1 (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 4–6; Wang et al., 2017, pp. 23–33).

In summary, curcumin exhibits several strengths that merit further evaluation as an adjunctive therapy for celiac disease. Its extensive history of safe use, its documented multi-targeted anti-inflammatory effects, and its ability to improve intestinal barrier function all support the scientific premise of the candidate. However, its clinical efficacy in celiac disease remains unproven due to the absence of direct clinical trial data, and challenges concerning its bioavailability must be overcome if true therapeutic benefits are to be realized. Consequently, while the preclinical data are promising and align well with the hypothesis that curcumin can modulate PKC and NF-κB pathways, suppress gliadin-induced zonulin release, and restore tight junction integrity, further targeted research—including formulation improvements and controlled clinical trials in celiac disease patient populations—is necessary before curcumin can be definitively recommended as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease (Calabriso et al., 2022, pp. 15–17; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall, our evaluation suggests that curcumin should remain under consideration as a promising repurposed drug for celiac disease with respect to its molecular mechanisms, although additional data will be required to overcome its pharmacokinetic drawbacks and to validate its efficacy in a clinical setting specific to celiac disease. The strategic next steps would include further in vitro studies in gluten-challenge models, optimization of curcumin formulations to enhance intestinal bioavailability, and eventually early-phase clinical trials designed specifically for patients with celiac disease. Such a systematic and stepwise approach will be critical to determine whether curcumin’s promising mechanistic profile can be translated into meaningful clinical benefits for celiac patients (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 7–9; Leech et al., 2019, pp. 9–10; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 20–22).

Quercetin,"Proposal for Quercetin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Quercetin is a naturally occurring flavonol—a subgroup of polyphenolic compounds—that is widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-derived foods. It is not a synthetic drug but is obtained primarily from natural sources such as apples, onions, berries, and tea. Historically, quercetin was originally identified through phytochemical investigations of plant extracts, and its structure—characterized by a polyphenolic backbone with hydroxyl substituents at positions 3, 3′, 4′, 5, and 7 (3,3′,4′,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone)—was elucidated through classical methods of isolation and spectroscopic analysis (Suzuki & Hara, 2011). This compound belongs to the flavonoid family, a major class of antioxidants that have been traditionally used as nutraceutical supplements and, in some cases, have shown promise in modulating inflammatory processes in various diseases. Flavonoids in general have been extensively studied for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cytoprotective properties, and quercetin, in particular, is well known for its ability to modulate cellular signaling pathways that regulate inflammation and barrier integrity. The natural origin and ease of extraction from dietary sources along with its favorable safety profile provide an attractive basis for considering quercetin as a repurposed candidate for diseases characterized by barrier dysfunction such as celiac disease (Suzuki & Hara, 2011; Khursheed et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Quercetin has a long history of use in both preclinical and clinical contexts as a dietary supplement with putative benefits in cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and various inflammatory conditions. In preclinical models, quercetin has been consistently reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities; for example, studies in cell culture systems have demonstrated its capacity to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production, modulate NF-κB signaling, and reduce oxidative stress in several tissues. Its safety profile in human nutritional studies and its common use as a dietary supplement have been widely documented, with extensive pharmacokinetic studies confirming that quercetin glycosides are metabolized and absorbed in the small intestine—with extensive conjugation by the liver and enterohepatic recycling contributing to its bioavailability (Suzuki & Hara, 2011; Khursheed et al., 2020). Despite its broad application in inflammatory and oxidative stress-related conditions, quercetin has not been previously registered in clinical trials specifically for celiac disease or gluten-mediated barrier dysfunction, as indicated by searches on ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, several preclinical investigations using intestinal epithelial models (such as Caco-2 monolayers) have demonstrated that polyphenols—including quercetin—can modulate the integrity of the intestinal barrier, support tight junction maintenance, and mitigate inflammatory responses in conditions that mimic gluten-induced damage (Calabriso et al., 2022; Chayalak et al., 2024). Additionally, related studies using animal models and in vitro systems have underscored the potential of polyphenolic compounds for reducing gut permeability, suggesting that the pharmacological properties of quercetin may be extendable to celiac disease, which is characterized by a “leaky gut” in response to gluten exposure (Calabriso et al., 2022; Van Buiten & Elias, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, quercetin exerts its therapeutic action through several interrelated mechanisms that target key signaling pathways involved in inflammation and the regulation of the intestinal epithelial barrier. One of the primary mechanisms proposed is the inhibition of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), an enzyme that phosphorylates myosin light chain (MLC) to drive actomyosin contraction; this process is pivotal in the regulation of tight junction (TJ) permeability. In inflammatory settings, cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) induce the expression of MLCK via activation of transcription factors like NF-κB and ERK1/2. This upregulation leads to increased MLCK activity and subsequent disruption of tight junction proteins such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin, resulting in increased paracellular permeability (Chayalak et al., 2024; Deachapunya & Chayalak, 2023). Quercetin has been shown in Caco-2 cell models to inhibit the IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB and ERK1/2, thereby reducing MLCK gene transcription and protein expression as well as decreasing the levels of phosphorylated MLC (p-MLC). This inhibition preserves the structural integrity of tight junctions and maintains transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), a measure of barrier function (Chayalak et al., 2024).

In addition to its effects on MLCK, quercetin is also proposed to attenuate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling. ER stress is characterized by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen, which activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). One of the key markers of ER stress is the induction of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP, also known as DDIT3), which when upregulated, can lead to apoptosis and further compromise barrier integrity. Although direct experimental evidence for quercetin’s modulation of ER stress in enterocytes challenged by gluten remains sparse, literature suggests that quercetin and its derivatives are capable of decreasing ER stress markers such as GRP78 and CHOP in other cell types, thereby mitigating apoptosis and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Eisvand et al., 2022). Given that gliadin exposure in celiac disease is associated with ER stress, quercetin’s ability to modulate the UPR may be beneficial in reducing ER stress-induced damage in intestinal epithelial cells.

Furthermore, quercetin has been shown to upregulate tight junction proteins directly. Several studies have reported that quercetin enhances the expression and proper localization of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, occludin, and claudin family members in intestinal epithelial models like Caco-2 cells. This upregulation is crucial because the distribution and assembly of these proteins are directly linked to the maintenance of the epithelial barrier. The reinforcement of tight junctions by quercetin may occur through its ability to inhibit multiple protein kinases, including MLCK, and through the modulation of other signaling cascades—such as MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and protein kinase C (PKC)—that regulate tight junction dynamics (Calabriso et al., 2022; Suzuki & Hara, 2011).

The overall molecular interactions of quercetin include binding to specific kinase domains or acting as a free-radical scavenger, hence reducing oxidative stress that can otherwise exacerbate both inflammatory signaling and ER stress. Quercetin’s molecular structure, enriched with hydroxyl groups, allows it to chelate metal ions and neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further ensures that the inflammatory milieu is tempered (Khursheed et al., 2020). This multifaceted mechanism, comprising direct kinase inhibition, cytokine modulation, antioxidation, and upregulation of barrier proteins, forms the biochemical rationale underpinning the hypothesis that quercetin will inhibit MLCK and ER stress signaling in enterocytes, upregulate tight junction proteins, and mitigate gliadin-induced barrier dysfunction.

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay using gliadin-challenged Caco-2 monolayers and potentially intestinal organoids, quercetin is expected to exert several beneficial effects that directly address the pathological features of celiac disease. Based on the working hypothesis, quercetin should exert the following effects:

1. Inhibition of MLCK Activation:
Gliadin exposure in enterocytes is known to trigger the upregulation of MLCK via pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1β) and associated signaling pathways (NF-κB and ERK1/2). By inhibiting these transcription factors, quercetin will lower MLCK mRNA and protein levels, leading to a decrease in MLCK-mediated phosphorylation of myosin light chain (p-MLC). This is expected to result in diminished contraction of the peri-junctional actomyosin ring and preservation of tight junction integrity, ultimately maintaining barrier function. The anticipated outcome, measured by increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and decreased paracellular flux of markers like FITC-dextran, would confirm that the epithelial barrier remains intact (Chayalak et al., 2024).

2. Attenuation of ER Stress and UPR Signaling:
Gliadin-induced stress in enterocytes is associated with the upregulation of ER stress markers, including CHOP/DDIT3, which contribute to cellular apoptosis and disruption of the epithelial barrier. Quercetin is expected to mitigate these effects by inhibiting the ER stress response, resulting in lower levels of CHOP expression and reduced phosphorylation of translation initiation factors such as eIF2α. Although direct evidence in gliadin models remains to be established, analogous studies in other epithelial cell types have demonstrated quercetin’s capacity to reduce ER stress, suggesting that a similar effect should be observable in the context of gluten exposure (Eisvand et al., 2022).

3. Upregulation of Tight Junction Proteins:
Quercetin is anticipated to induce or stabilize the expression of key tight junction proteins such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1/TJP1), occludin, and claudins. The preservation or enhancement of these proteins’ expression and proper localization at the intercellular junctions will strengthen the intestinal barrier, thereby reducing gliadin-induced hyperpermeability. Experiments with Caco-2 monolayers have shown that dietary polyphenols can increase tight junction protein expression, and quercetin treatment is expected to translate to similar outcomes (Calabriso et al., 2022; Suzuki & Hara, 2011).

4. Reduction in Inflammatory Signaling:
By inhibiting NF-κB activation, quercetin is expected to lower the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6. This reduction in the inflammatory cascade not only limits further upregulation of MLCK but also contributes to an overall improvement in barrier function. Given that gliadin exposure is associated with increased oxidative stress and cytokine production, quercetin’s antioxidant properties may further reduce the pro-inflammatory environment in the gut (Chayalak et al., 2024; Calabriso et al., 2022).

5. Preservation of TEER and Barrier Function:
The integrated effects of MLCK inhibition, reduced ER stress, tight junction protein upregulation, and dampened inflammatory signaling are expected to result in maintained or improved TEER measurements in Caco-2 monolayers or human intestinal organoids upon gliadin challenge. This preservation of barrier function is a critical factor in mitigating the intestinal damage associated with celiac disease and supports the hypothesis that quercetin acts as an effective barrier-protective agent (Chayalak et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
The evidence from the literature supports a promising role for quercetin as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease particularly focused on intestinal barrier dysfunction. There are several strengths that enhance its candidacy:

• Quercetin is a naturally derived flavonol with a well-established safety profile; it is commonly consumed in the diet and has been used as a dietary supplement with extensive pharmacokinetic characterization (Suzuki & Hara, 2011; Khursheed et al., 2020).
• Its multifaceted mechanism of action—encompassing inhibition of MLCK via suppression of NF-κB and ERK1/2, attenuation of ER stress as indicated by reduced CHOP expression, and upregulation or stabilization of tight junction proteins like ZO-1—supports an integrated therapeutic approach to restoring intestinal barrier integrity (Chayalak et al., 2024; Deachapunya & Chayalak, 2023).
• Preclinical studies in Caco-2 models have demonstrated that quercetin effectively preserves barrier function under inflammatory conditions, as evidenced by maintained TEER and reduced paracellular permeability (Chayalak et al., 2024).
• The underlying rationale is reinforced by literature from related polyphenols and flavonoids, which have been reported to modulate enzymes and signaling pathways critical to intestinal permeability. This includes modulation of oxidative stress, downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and inhibition of kinases implicated in tight junction disassembly (Calabriso et al., 2022; Suzuki & Hara, 2011).

However, there are weaknesses and gaps that require further exploration before advancing quercetin as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease:

• While the molecular mechanisms of quercetin in inhibiting MLCK and preserving tight junction integrity are supported by preclinical data, direct evidence in the context of gliadin or gluten-induced barrier dysfunction is limited. Most available studies have focused primarily on IL-1β-induced inflammatory models rather than on gliadin-specific challenges, which leaves a gap in the translational model for celiac disease (Chayalak et al., 2024; Calabriso et al., 2022).
• Although there are promising data suggesting quercetin’s role in attenuating ER stress in other cellular contexts, direct measurements of ER stress markers such as CHOP/DDIT3 in gliadin-challenged enterocytes or organoids have not been robustly documented. This represents an important mechanistic gap since ER stress is a key mediator of cell dysfunction in celiac disease (Eisvand et al., 2022).
• Clinical trials specifically targeting celiac disease with quercetin are currently absent, as indicated by searches on clinical trial registries. This means that while preclinical data are compelling, a significant translational step remains before quercetin can be validated as a therapy for celiac disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
• The multifactorial nature of celiac disease, which involves immune dysregulation, genetic predisposition (e.g., HLA-DQ2/DQ8), and complex interactions between dietary gluten and gut microbiota, may not be fully addressed by quercetin alone. It is likely that quercetin would need to be evaluated as an adjunctive therapy rather than as a stand-alone treatment (Calabriso et al., 2022; Van Buiten & Elias, 2021).
• Dose-dependent effects, including potential cytotoxicity at higher concentrations, have been documented in vitro. Careful dose optimization is required to ensure that quercetin is both effective and safe in a clinical setting (Chayalak et al., 2024; Deachapunya & Chayalak, 2023).

In conclusion, quercetin exhibits strong potential as a therapeutic candidate for the prevention of gliadin-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction in celiac disease. Its natural origin, favorable safety profile, and multifaceted mechanism of action—particularly its capacity to inhibit MLCK, mitigate inflammatory signaling, and potentially reduce ER stress—render it an attractive candidate for repurposing. Nevertheless, there remains a need for further targeted studies, particularly those that evaluate quercetin’s effects directly in gliadin-exposed intestinal epithelial models and in relevant animal or clinical settings. The gaps in evidence related to direct modulation of ER stress markers such as CHOP/DDIT3 and the lack of clinical trial data underscore the necessity of additional preclinical research. These studies should aim to optimize dosing, assess long-term effects, and establish robust mechanistic links specific to the pathophysiological features of celiac disease. Given the promising preclinical data, quercetin should be considered for further investigation as a potential adjuvant therapy for celiac disease, with the ultimate goal of preserving intestinal barrier integrity and mitigating disease progression (Calabriso et al., 2022; Chayalak et al., 2024; Deachapunya & Chayalak, 2023).

"TAK-242 (Resatorvid, TLR4 antagonist)

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of TAK-242 (Resatorvid) as a repurposed drug candidate for celiac disease. The evaluation is organized in five sections: an","Proposal for TAK-242 (Resatorvid, TLR4 antagonist)

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of TAK-242 (Resatorvid) as a repurposed drug candidate for celiac disease. The evaluation is organized in five sections: an overview of the therapeutic candidate, its therapeutic history, its detailed mechanism of action at the molecular level, the expected effect on enterocyte and immune cell physiology in celiac disease, and a final overall evaluation that highlights strengths, weaknesses, and gaps that must be addressed in further studies.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
TAK-242, also known as Resatorvid, is a fully synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor that belongs to the class of Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonists. Unlike many natural products derived from microbial sources, TAK-242 was rationally designed using structure–activity relationship (SAR) approaches to specifically target the intracellular aspects of TLR4 signaling. Its chemical structure is that of a cyclohexene derivative with an ethyl ester moiety that is bonded to a sulfonamide group attached to a 2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl ring. The synthesis of TAK-242 was achieved through modern synthetic organic chemistry methods that allowed for precise tailoring of the pharmacophore to achieve high selectivity for the TLR4 receptor (Matsunaga et al., 2011). This compound is not derived from any natural source; it is a fully synthetic, rationally engineered molecule. TAK-242 is one member of a broader therapeutic class of TLR4 antagonists that have been developed to modulate innate immune responses. Compounds in this class generally work by interfering with the protein–protein interactions that are essential for TLR4 signaling. Historically, such compounds have been mainly investigated for the modulation of inflammatory responses in conditions like sepsis, where blockage of TLR4 activation was expected to limit the “cytokine storm” associated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure (Janda et al., 2016; Bruno et al., 2018). Therefore, TAK-242 represents a tool compound that has been optimized in terms of selectivity and potency for inhibiting TLR4 and is now being explored for repurposing in other diseases where TLR4-mediated inflammation plays a pathogenic role.

Therapeutic History:
In terms of therapeutic history, TAK-242 has been predominantly evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials for acute inflammatory conditions. For instance, its early clinical development focused on patients suffering from severe sepsis. In several randomized controlled trials—including those registered under NCT00143611 (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2005) and NCT00633477 (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008)—TAK-242 was administered with the aim of mitigating the TLR4-driven systemic inflammatory response triggered by bacterial LPS. Although these trials provided evidence that TAK-242 engages its target and is associated with an acceptable safety profile, they ultimately did not demonstrate a significant reduction in mortality in sepsis patients. This shortcoming has been attributed to the multifaceted nature of sepsis, in which numerous redundant proinflammatory pathways are activated (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Engelmann et al., 2020). In addition to sepsis, TAK-242 has been explored in other acute inflammatory contexts, such as liver failure associated with acute alcohol-induced injury and in animal models of ischemia–reperfusion injury. Preclinical studies have also demonstrated that TLR4 antagonism with TAK-242 can be beneficial in models of rheumatoid arthritis, where it diminished the inflammatory cytokine production from fibroblast-like synoviocytes (Kim et al., 2021; Karami et al., 2021). Despite these varied applications, there is no record in the literature of TAK-242 being directly tested in celiac disease or gluten-induced enteropathy models. Its previous use in systemic inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, however, provides a rationale to explore whether its inhibition of TLR4 might also ameliorate the epithelial barrier dysfunction and aberrant immune activation seen in celiac disease (Ailioaie et al., 2022; Bascuñán et al., 2025). In summary, while TAK-242 has a robust history as an anti-inflammatory agent in both preclinical and clinical studies—especially in sepsis and rheumatoid arthritis—its therapeutic application in celiac disease remains entirely hypothetical and represents a novel repurposing opportunity.

Mechanism of Action:
TAK-242’s mechanism of action is one of its strongest attributes, having been elucidated in considerable molecular detail over the past decade. The fundamental mechanism involves the selective binding of TAK-242 to the intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain of TLR4. Specifically, it has been shown that TAK-242 covalently attaches to the cysteine residue at position 747 (Cys747) within the TIR domain. This covalent binding is mediated by an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group present in the molecule that acts as a Michael acceptor, facilitating the formation of a covalent bond with a sulfhydryl (–SH) group on Cys747 (Matsunaga et al., 2011). The consequence of this binding is that the conformation of TLR4’s TIR domain is altered such that it cannot effectively recruit its essential adaptor proteins—namely TIRAP (also referred to as MAL) and TRAM. Under normal conditions, binding of ligands such as LPS (or, potentially in the context of celiac disease, damage-associated molecular patterns—or DAMPs—released from stressed epithelial cells) to TLR4 leads to receptor dimerization and recruitment of adaptor proteins. These adaptor proteins then propagate the downstream signaling cascade via either the MyD88-dependent or MyD88-independent (TRIF-dependent) pathways, culminating in nuclear translocation of NF-κB and activation of transcription factors such as AP-1 and interferon regulatory factors. These transcription factors in turn stimulate the production of a broad range of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and interferons (Matsunaga et al., 2011; Janda et al., 2016).
TAK-242 effectively interrupts this process by blocking the protein–protein interactions between TLR4 and its adaptors. As a result, the subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of IRAK-1 (an early signaling kinase in the MyD88 cascade) are prevented, and the activation of NF-κB is significantly diminished. In vitro studies have demonstrated that TAK-242 reduces LPS-induced cytokine production in multiple cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, and even epithelial cells. This confirms that TAK-242 is capable of broadly suppressing TLR4-mediated inflammatory responses (Bruno et al., 2018; Dixit, 2020).
The relevance of this mechanism to celiac disease lies in the hypothetical role of TLR4 in mediating the innate immune response to gluten-induced epithelial stress. In celiac disease, gluten ingestion is thought to lead to damage and stress of the intestinal epithelial cells. This stress results in the release of DAMPs, which can bind to and activate TLR4 on the surface of enterocytes and resident immune cells. This TLR4 activation, through its downstream MyD88/NF-κB signaling cascade, is believed to contribute to the upregulation of inflammatory mediators such as IL-15, along with enzymes like myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which can disrupt tight junction proteins and increase intestinal permeability (Junker & Schuppan, 2008; Junker et al., 2010). By blocking the initial step of TLR4 adaptor recruitment, TAK-242 is expected to reduce NF-κB nuclear translocation and consequently decrease the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and MLCK. This would stabilize the tight junctions between enterocytes and help maintain transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), an experimental measure of barrier function (Unknown Reference; Bascuñán et al., 2025).
In summary, TAK-242’s well-established biochemical mechanism—centered on covalent targeting of TLR4’s intracellular domain to prevent adaptor recruitment—directly supports its proposed use in modulating the inflammatory cascades that are hypothesized to play a key role in celiac disease.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis under investigation is that TAK-242 will inhibit TLR4 signaling on enterocytes and resident immune cells in the gut mucosa, thereby reducing the downstream MyD88/NF-κB activation that is incited by gluten-induced DAMPs. In the setting of a gliadin challenge (which models the epithelial stress produced by gluten ingestion), TAK-242 is expected to work through several interconnected pathways.
First, by binding the TIR domain of TLR4 and preventing adaptor recruitment, TAK-242 should block the activation cascade that normally leads to NF-κB nuclear translocation. A reduction in NF-κB activity will result in lower transcription of several proinflammatory cytokines, among which IL-15 is particularly important in the pathology of celiac disease. IL-15 is known to instigate cytotoxicity in intraepithelial lymphocytes and is implicated in driving tissue damage (Junker & Schuppan, 2008; Unknown Reference).
Second, diminished NF-κB activity is predicted to lead to a reduction in the expression of MLCK. MLCK is an enzyme that regulates the contraction of the cytoskeleton in enterocytes and has been shown to play a critical role in modifying tight junction integrity. Increased MLCK activity has been correlated with elevated paracellular permeability, which is a hallmark of the disrupted intestinal barrier in celiac disease. By curbing MLCK expression, TAK-242 should help preserve the structure and function of tight junctions, thereby stabilizing TEER in an epithelial culture assay (Bascuñán et al., 2025; Unknown Reference).
Moreover, intestinal epithelial cells and resident immune cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages are known to express TLR4 as a part of their innate immune machinery. The inhibition of TLR4 signaling in these cell types is expected to lead to an environment with reduced basal inflammatory tone. In an in vitro model where enterocytes are challenged with gliadin peptides, TAK-242-treated cultures would be expected to show decreased levels of nuclear NF-κB, reduced immunostaining for IL-15 and MLCK, and improved TEER compared to controls. This set of cellular events would support the hypothesis that TAK-242 can protect against gluten-induced barrier disruption (Junker et al., 2010; Karami et al., 2021).
In addition to the molecular events observed in cellular models, one might also predict that in an in vivo setting—such as in a suitable animal model of celiac disease—the administration of TAK-242 would lead to reduced histopathological signs of intestinal inflammation, a preservation of villous architecture, and diminished levels of cytokines in the gut mucosa. These expected outcomes would directly translate into a more intact epithelial barrier and attenuated immune activation that characterizes the chronic phase of celiac disease.
Thus, the expected effect of TAK-242 in the proposed assay is multifaceted: it is anticipated to reduce NF-κB activation, lower the production of key inflammatory mediators including IL-15, decrease MLCK expression, and ultimately stabilize tight junction domains within the intestinal epithelium. This cascade of events should result in measurable improvements in TEER values, indicating that the paracellular leak characteristic of celiac disease is being mitigated through the blockade of the TLR4 pathway.

Overall Evaluation:
TAK-242 emerges from this evaluation as a mechanistically sound and promising candidate for the repurposing effort aimed at treating celiac disease, even though its use in this specific context remains untested. One of its greatest strengths lies in its well-defined mechanism of action. By covalently binding to the TLR4 TIR domain at Cys747, TAK-242 prevents the critical recruitment of adaptor proteins TIRAP and TRAM. This inhibition interferes with both MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways, leading to a significant reduction in NF-κB and AP-1-driven transcription of proinflammatory mediators (Matsunaga et al., 2011; Janda et al., 2016). The precision of this mechanism is directly relevant to celiac disease, where aberrant TLR4 activation is thought to contribute to heightened inflammatory responses following gluten-induced epithelial stress (Junker & Schuppan, 2008; Bascuñán et al., 2025).

From a therapeutic history standpoint, the substantial body of work in sepsis clinical trials as well as preclinical studies in other inflammatory conditions provides a robust safety and pharmacodynamic profile for TAK-242 (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Engelmann et al., 2020). Although its efficacy in sepsis was mixed, the fact that TAK-242 has been administered to human subjects at doses that achieve meaningful TLR4 inhibition lowers the translational risk of repurposing, especially if its dosing can be optimized for localized effects in the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, in rheumatoid arthritis models, TAK-242 has demonstrated the capacity to reduce key inflammatory markers and immune cell proliferation, which adds to its repertoire as an anti-inflammatory agent (Kim et al., 2021).

Nevertheless, several key weaknesses and uncertainties remain. First, no direct preclinical studies have yet evaluated TAK-242 within the context of celiac disease. The pathogenic milieu in celiac disease is complex, involving not only innate immune activation via TLR4 but also robust adaptive immune components driven by gluten-specific T-cell responses and autoantibody formation. It is unclear whether inhibition of TLR4 alone will suffice to overcome the multifactorial nature of this disorder (Ailioaie et al., 2022; Unknown Reference). Second, while TAK-242 is effective at diminishing inflammation in sepsis and arthritis models, the gastrointestinal environment presents unique challenges. The gut mucosa contains a complex array of pattern-recognition receptors that play essential roles in host defense. Broad inhibition of TLR4 in the gut could potentially interfere with normal immune surveillance and microbial homeostasis. Moreover, the local pharmacokinetics of TAK-242 when administered for a chronic condition such as celiac disease will require careful evaluation. It is vital to determine if the drug can be delivered effectively to the intestinal epithelium at concentrations high enough to inhibit TLR4 signaling without inducing off-target or immunosuppressive effects (Junker et al., 2010).
Another point of caution is that the majority of the supportive data for TAK-242 come from studies using LPS as an agonist, whereas in celiac disease the activating ligands are DAMPs released as a result of gluten-induced epithelial stress. Although there is literature supporting a role for TLR4 in mediating responses to gliadin and non-gluten components of wheat (Junker & Schuppan, 2008), the exact nature and potency of these DAMPs may differ from bacterial endotoxin. Thus, there is an inherent uncertainty whether TAK-242’s inhibition of TLR4 will fully translate into meaningful protection against the barrier dysfunction observed in celiac disease.
On the other hand, the molecular data supporting TAK-242’s precise binding to TLR4—along with its ability to inhibit both MyD88- and TRIF-mediated signaling cascades—makes a compelling case for its inclusion in further preclinical assays, particularly in gliadin-challenged epithelial cultures where downstream markers (such as NF-κB nuclear translocation, IL-15 expression, and MLCK levels) and functional outcomes (measured via TEER) can be quantified (Matsunaga et al., 2011; Janda et al., 2016; Unknown Reference).
Furthermore, the ability to repurpose a molecule with an already established safety profile in humans is highly attractive from a drug development perspective. Lowering the risk associated with toxicity and adverse effects is crucial when considering new treatments for a chronic condition like celiac disease. This is particularly important given that patients with celiac disease currently rely on a gluten-free diet—an intervention that, while effective, carries its own challenges and limitations. If TAK-242 can be shown in robust preclinical models to improve epithelial barrier integrity and reduce inflammation without compromising the gut’s defense mechanisms, it could serve either as an adjunct or as part of combination therapies to manage celiac disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Bascuñán et al., 2025).

Taking into account the detailed molecular mechanism by which TAK-242 functions, its precedented safety in clinical trials for inflammatory indications, and its potential to correct key pathological processes in celiac disease (namely, cytokine-mediated tight junction disruption and barrier leak), TAK-242 is a mechanistically compelling candidate for repurposing. However, the significant gaps—particularly the absence of direct evidence in models of gluten-induced intestinal injury—highlight the necessity for rigorous preclinical experimentation. Critical experiments should include:
1. In vitro studies using gliadin-challenged enterocyte cultures to evaluate changes in NF-κB activity, IL-15 and MLCK expression, and TEER measurements upon treatment with TAK-242.
2. In vivo studies using well-characterized animal models that mimic intestinal inflammation and barrier dysfunction observed in celiac disease. These studies should measure histopathological changes, cytokine profiles, and overall barrier integrity after administration of TAK-242.
3. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments focusing on the local delivery of TAK-242 to the gut mucosa, ensuring that effective drug concentrations can be maintained in the intestinal milieu without systemic immunosuppression.
4. Evaluations of the impact on the gut microbiome and mucosal immune defense, given the unique and delicate balance in the gastrointestinal tract.

If these studies confirm that TAK-242 can intercept the aberrant TLR4 signaling induced by gluten-related epithelial stress, then there will be a strong justification for moving this candidate into early-phase clinical trials in patients with celiac disease. Such trials would need to incorporate biomarkers of barrier function along with standard clinical endpoints to assess both safety and efficacy.

In conclusion, TAK-242 presents as a promising and scientifically credible candidate for repurposing in the treatment of celiac disease. Its synthetic origin and rational design as a TLR4 antagonist endow it with a precisely defined molecular mechanism that directly addresses a hypothesized driver of celiac pathology—gluten-induced epithelial stress leading to DAMP-mediated TLR4 activation. The extensive preclinical and clinical data on TAK-242 in sepsis and other inflammatory conditions provide a foundation for confidence in its target engagement and safety profile. Nonetheless, the absence of direct validation in celiac disease models, uncertainties regarding its effect on the multifaceted immune dysregulation characteristic of the disease, and the challenges associated with drug delivery to the gut represent key hurdles. Addressing these issues through focused preclinical research will be paramount to establishing TAK-242’s ultimate utility in this new clinical context. Overall, while several important questions remain, the molecular rationale for TAK-242 is compelling, and it merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic to stabilize epithelial barrier function, reduce proinflammatory cytokine release—including IL-15—and ultimately improve clinical outcomes in patients suffering from celiac disease (Matsunaga et al., 2011; Janda et al., 2016; Junker & Schuppan, 2008; Unknown Reference).

Below is a detailed evaluation of ML-7 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease. This review covers its origins, historical use, mechanism, expected effects in disease-relevant assays, and an overall discussion of its strengths and potential limitations, drawing exclusively on the available literature.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
ML-7 is a synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor specifically designed to target myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), an enzyme that plays a critical role in regulating actomyosin contraction and maintaining tight junction (TJ) integrity in epithelial cells. The molecule belongs to the naphthalene sulphonamide class of compounds, originally synthesized as an ATP‐competitive inhibitor aimed at interfering with the catalytic function of MLCK. Notably, ML-7 exerts its function by binding to the ATP-binding site of MLCK with an approximate half‐maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of around 300 nM, which indicates high potency. Designed for membrane permeability, ML-7 has been optimized to cross cellular membranes effectively, allowing it to reach intracellular MLCK in the gastrointestinal epithelium. This compound is part of a broader class of kinase inhibitors that have been widely employed as research tools in cytoskeletal studies, permitting investigators to modulate actomyosin contractility and study the resulting effects on cell adhesion and barrier function (Shi et al., 2007; Xiong et al., 2017). The fact that ML-7 is a synthetic agent rather than a naturally derived product allows for precise chemical modifications if necessary, and its well-documented intestinal distribution further supports its selection for conditions involving gastrointestinal barrier disruption. In the context of celiac disease, where gliadin exposure leads to immune activation and a subsequent increase in paracellular leak through tight junction disruption, a compound that can inhibit MLCK is anticipated to help stabilize the epithelial barrier, thus limiting the cascade of inflammatory events triggered by barrier dysfunction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History
Historically, ML-7 has been used extensively in preclinical studies as a tool to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying epithelial and endothelial barrier dysfunction. In numerous biochemical experiments using cultured epithelial cell monolayers such as Caco-2 cells, ML-7 has been shown to reduce the leakiness of the epithelium by inhibiting the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) that is normally driven by MLCK. For example, in studies using intestinal organoids and Caco-2 monolayers, ML-7 treatment was associated with improved transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and reduced paracellular flux of marker molecules, demonstrating its ability to restore barrier function under inflammatory conditions (Feighery et al., 2008; Qasim, 2012). Additionally, the compound has been employed to interrogate the pathways that lead to tight junction protein mislocalization—specifically the redistribution of proteins like zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin—both of which are important for the structural integrity of the barrier (Catalioto et al., 2011). Although there is no record in the available literature of ML-7 being used directly to treat celiac disease in clinical studies, its efficacy in models of intestinal barrier dysfunction has been well established. Furthermore, a broad clinical trial search for MLCK inhibitors in various contexts—ranging from gastrointestinal diseases to inflammatory disorders—indicates a significant interest among researchers in molecules that can modulate barrier function, thereby reinforcing the rationale behind exploring ML-7 for celiac disease treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ochoa et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, ML-7 acts by binding to the catalytic region of MLCK, thereby preventing the phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (MLC). Under basal conditions, MLCK phosphorylates MLC, a fundamental step required for actomyosin contraction. In the gastrointestinal epithelium, this contraction is tightly regulated to modulate the opening and closing of tight junctions, which determine the paracellular permeability of the epithelium. However, in inflammatory conditions such as those encountered in celiac disease, excessive MLCK activation is observed. This upregulation is driven by a combination of proinflammatory cytokine signaling (for example, TNF-α and interleukin-1β) and the direct effects of gliadin peptides, which together lead to an aberrant increase in MLCK expression and activity (Al-Sadi et al., 2008; Turner, 2012). The resulting increase in MLC phosphorylation triggers an augmented actomyosin contraction in the perijunctional region. This mechanical force leads to the disassembly or redistribution of critical tight junction components—including ZO-1 and occludin—effectively increasing the permeability of the intestinal barrier (Jin & Blikslager, 2020; Turner, 2012).

ML-7’s mechanism of action is based on its competitive inhibition profile: it occupies the enzyme’s ATP-binding site, thereby preventing ATP from binding and disabling the kinase’s catalytic function. This directly decreases the level of phosphorylated MLC, thereby reducing actomyosin contraction. Research shows that upon ML-7 treatment there is a correlational decrease in the disassembly of tight junction proteins, with ZO-1 and occludin remaining predominantly localized at the cell membrane rather than being internalized or redistributed (Qasim, 2012; Xiong et al., 2017). Such stabilization of the tight junction complex leads to improved epithelial barrier properties, as indicated by normalized TEER and reduced flux of small molecules across the epithelium. The importance of MLCK in barrier regulation is underscored by the observation that inflammatory mediators, such as those activated downstream of protein kinase C (PKC) or those released upon gliadin challenge, typically exert their barrier-disruptive effects via MLCK activation. Therefore, by blocking this central mediator, ML-7 is hypothesized to prevent the cascade of events that lead to barrier dysfunction (Turner, 2006; Jin & Blikslager, 2020).

Expected Effect
In the proposed celiac disease model, particularly in assays using gliadin-treated Caco-2 monolayers or patient-derived intestinal organoids, the expected outcome of ML-7 treatment can be described in several steps. First, by inhibiting MLCK, ML-7 is expected to lead to a substantial reduction in the phosphorylation state of MLC. This decrease in pMLC would attenuate the excessive actomyosin contraction associated with inflammatory stimuli and gliadin exposure. As a result, the mechanical force needed to pull apart cell–cell junctions would be minimized, allowing tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 and occludin to remain at the cell membrane and retain their proper junctional alignment (Feighery et al., 2008; Qasim, 2012).

Second, because tight junction integrity is a direct determinant of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), ML-7 treatment should normalize TEER in these models. A restoration of TEER would indicate that borders between cells are more “sealed” and that the paracellular pathway no longer permits the unintended translocation of luminal antigens or other molecules—a feature that is fundamental for maintaining gut barrier function (Jin & Blikslager, 2020; He et al., 2020).

Third, on a more functional level, assays that measure the paracellular passage of tracer molecules (such as FITC-dextran flux assays) would be expected to show decreased permeability following ML-7 treatment. This functional improvement would be a direct consequence of improved tight junction stability and reduced MLC phosphorylation, validating the concept that ML-7 is effective in restoring the physiological paracellular seal (Qasim, 2012; McKinney, 2016).

Moreover, because MLCK is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli, the application of ML-7 is anticipated to specifically target the aberrant signaling pathways that lead to barrier dysfunction in celiac disease. Under gliadin challenge, when immune-mediated signals trigger cytokine release and further MLCK upregulation, ML-7 should counteract these effects by maintaining the steady-state distribution of key tight junction proteins. This series of effects, from reduced pMLC to normalized TEER and decreased paracellular flux, directly addresses the primary barrier defect in celiac disease (Al-Sadi et al., 2008; Jin & Blikslager, 2020).

Given that the underlying rationale is supported by numerous studies in other inflammatory models, the expected outcome in celiac disease models is promising. The restoration of barrier function would not only help to limit the aberrant influx of gliadin peptides and other luminal antigens but also potentially dampen the ensuing immune response. Thus, in preclinical models, ML-7 is expected to ameliorate key pathophysiological events linked to celiac disease by re-establishing an effective paracellular seal (Catalioto et al., 2011; Qasim, 2012).

Overall Evaluation
ML-7 presents a compelling case as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease due to its well-characterized mode of action, potent inhibitory properties, and documented effects on epithelial barrier restoration. Its development as a synthetic small-molecule inhibitor specifically targeting MLCK has provided researchers with an effective tool to dissect the role of actomyosin regulation in epithelial barrier dysfunction. The biochemical evidence in studies using Caco-2 monolayers and patient-derived organoids is particularly encouraging, with ML-7 shown to reduce MLC phosphorylation, preserve tight junction protein localization, normalize TEER, and decrease paracellular permeability (Feighery et al., 2008; Qasim, 2012).

One of the greatest strengths of ML-7 lies in its robust preclinical validation in models of inflammatory barrier dysfunction. The literature consistently demonstrates that inhibition of MLCK by ML-7 leads to stabilization of the epithelial barrier under inflammatory conditions typical of gastrointestinal diseases. In celiac disease, where gliadin-induced cytokine production disrupts tight junctions, the ability of ML-7 to prevent the phosphorylation of MLC and subsequent actomyosin-driven junction opening is mechanistically sound (Al-Sadi et al., 2008; Turner, 2012). Its documented intestinal distribution further supports its potential use as a localized therapy within the gut.

However, ML-7 is not without its limitations. A significant concern revolves around its selectivity. As an ATP-competitive inhibitor, ML-7 may also interact with other kinases that share similar ATP-binding domains. This raises the possibility of off-target effects that could compromise functions in smooth muscle, cardiac tissue, and other critical systems. The potential for such off-target interactions may lead to unwanted side effects, including disturbances in vascular tone or gastrointestinal motility (Xiong et al., 2017; Rigor et al., 2013). Addressing this issue would require careful dose optimization and may even necessitate the development of more selective analogs or localized delivery methods that minimize systemic exposure.

Another challenge is the current lack of direct clinical evidence supporting the use of ML-7 in celiac disease. Although numerous studies have validated its function in improving barrier integrity in inflammatory models, ML-7 has not been evaluated in clinical trials for celiac disease. The extensive number of clinical studies involving MLCK inhibitors in intestinal diseases, as highlighted by broad clinical trial searches, indicates a strong research interest; however, translation into therapeutic use for celiac disease remains at an early stage (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ochoa et al., 2023). Therefore, further research using disease-specific models—such as gliadin-challenged patient-derived organoids—and rigorous toxicological studies would be essential to fully validate its potential.

Moreover, the ATP-competitive mechanism of ML-7, while effective in vitro, may not entirely capture the complex regulation of MLCK in vivo. In the inflammatory microenvironment of celiac disease, multiple signaling pathways converge to upregulate MLCK activity. Some studies suggest that targeting the recruitment or localization of specific MLCK isoforms (for example, MLCK1) might yield better specificity and fewer side effects compared to broad ATP-competitive inhibitors (Graham et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2024). Such next-generation inhibitors, or alternative strategies that modulate MLCK activity indirectly, may eventually provide safer therapeutic profiles. Nonetheless, the extensive mechanistic data gathered with ML-7 continue to make it a valuable candidate and an important proof-of-concept agent to validate MLCK as a therapeutic target in celiac disease.

In terms of expected cellular effects, ML-7 has been repeatedly shown to decrease the phosphorylation of MLC, a direct readout for MLCK activity. This biochemical effect translates into a more stabilized cytoskeletal and junctional architecture with preserved localization of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 and occludin. In experimental models, these changes are accompanied by improvements in TEER and reduced paracellular leakage—both quantitative indicators of enhanced epithelial barrier function (Jin & Blikslager, 2020; Qasim, 2012). Given the strong evidence that MLCK is hyperactive in inflammatory states and that its activation contributes to barrier defects in conditions like Crohn’s disease and likely celiac disease, the ability of ML-7 to counteract these processes is a major asset in its favor (Al-Sadi et al., 2008; Turner, 2012).

Another strength of ML-7 is its well-characterized preclinical profile as a research tool. Over decades of study, ML-7’s inhibitory effects on MLCK have been reproducibly demonstrated in a range of models. This body of work not only confirms the central role of MLCK in barrier regulation but also provides a clear rationale for its inhibition in disease states where barrier dysfunction is pathogenic. The extensive documentation of ML-7’s effects in epithelial cell monolayer systems and patient-derived organoids, along with its robust biochemical profile, lays a strong foundation for its further development and optimization (Feighery et al., 2008; Qasim, 2012).

Despite these advantages, the translational pathway for ML-7 is not without hurdles. The off-target interactions discussed previously remain a key challenge, as systemic inhibition of kinases with similar ATP-binding characteristics could lead to adverse events. Therefore, one potential strategy to overcome this limitation would involve the formulation of ML-7 in a way that targets it specifically to the gut—for example, using enteric-coated formulations or localized delivery systems that concentrate the drug at the site of pathology. Such approaches could help minimize systemic exposure and thereby reduce the potential for adverse effects on other tissues.

A further potential limitation to consider is the context-dependent regulation of MLCK in different tissues. While MLCK is critically involved in the regulation of intestinal tight junctions, its isoforms are also expressed in other cell types, including smooth muscle. Therefore, a therapy that non-selectively inhibits MLCK may inadvertently impair normal physiological functions in these tissues. For a patient with celiac disease, where the primary pathology involves immune-mediated damage to the intestinal epithelium following gluten ingestion, limiting off-target effects is essential. Future preclinical studies might focus on comparing ML-7 to newer, more selective inhibitors that target MLCK isoforms specifically associated with epithelial barrier dysfunction. For instance, compounds that interfere with MLCK1 recruitment rather than its catalytic site have shown promise in preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease and could provide a more refined approach with fewer side effects (Graham et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2024).

It is also important to note that while ML-7 has been used widely in in vitro and ex vivo models, its safety and efficacy in vivo in humans have yet to be thoroughly characterized. The successful translation of an agent like ML-7 from bench to bedside requires rigorous pharmacokinetic profiling, toxicology studies, and clinical trials to ensure that the benefits seen in cellular models can be realized in the complex environment of the human intestine under chronic inflammatory conditions.

Taken together, the preclinical evidence strongly supports the concept that MLCK inhibition can restore barrier integrity by preventing excessive actomyosin contraction and protecting tight junction organization in the face of inflammatory challenges. In celiac disease, where gliadin-induced cytokine release and inflammation are known to disrupt the epithelial barrier, ML-7 would be expected to counteract these processes by maintaining the physiological paracellular seal. This hypothesis is directly in line with observed outcomes in models of inflammatory intestinal barrier dysfunction (Al-Sadi et al., 2008; Jin & Blikslager, 2020).

Overall Evaluation and Future Directions
In summary, ML-7 is a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent in celiac disease because it directly targets a key pathogenic mechanism: the MLCK-dependent opening of tight junctions that leads to barrier dysfunction. Its well-documented ability to inhibit MLC phosphorylation, preserve the localization of tight junction proteins (such as ZO-1 and occludin), and normalize TEER in experimental models provides strong mechanistic support for its potential efficacy. Given that MLCK activation is a critical intermediate step in the cascade triggered by inflammatory cytokines and gliadin peptides, ML-7’s capacity to block this step offers a rational strategy to interrupt the cycle of barrier loss and immune activation that underpins celiac pathology (Turner, 2012; Qasim, 2012).

The strengths of ML-7 include its potency (with an IC50 near 300 nM), its historical validation across multiple models of barrier dysfunction, and its favorable intestinal distribution—features that make it particularly relevant for gastrointestinal applications. The preclinical studies that demonstrate its efficacy in both cell culture and patient-derived organoids provide a robust rationale for further investigation. Additionally, the broad interest in MLCK inhibitors as evidenced by extensive clinical trial searches further substantiates the therapeutic potential of targeting MLCK in diseases marked by barrier disruption (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Nonetheless, there remain critical concerns regarding selectivity and the potential for off-target effects. The ATP-competitive mechanism of ML-7, while effective in vitro, does not guarantee absolute specificity for MLCK, and similar kinase domains in other proteins could inadvertently be inhibited. This issue is of particular concern given the widespread expression of MLCK isoforms and the necessity to preserve normal physiological functions in tissues such as vascular smooth muscle. Consequently, further studies must address these safety issues, possibly through targeted drug delivery approaches or through medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at improving selectivity (Xiong et al., 2017; Rigor et al., 2013).

Future directions for development include exploring localized delivery systems—such as encapsulated formulations designed for release in the intestinal lumen—to minimize systemic exposure while maximizing local efficacy. Comparative studies with next-generation MLCK inhibitors that may target regulatory domains unique to the intestinal epithelial isoform of MLCK (for instance, MLCK1) are also warranted. Such studies could help clarify whether ML-7 or a more selective compound would offer the optimum balance of efficacy and safety in the context of celiac disease. Furthermore, rigorous preclinical evaluation in animal models of gluten-induced barrier dysfunction would be essential to determine the translational potential of ML-7 before embarking on clinical trials (Graham et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2024).

In conclusion, ML-7 stands out as a valuable candidate to validate the role of MLCK in the pathogenesis of celiac disease and potentially restore epithelial barrier integrity. Its ability to reverse key functional disruptions—including reduced MLC phosphorylation, preservation of tight junction protein distribution, normalization of TEER, and decreased paracellular permeability—is directly aligned with addressing the core barrier dysfunction observed in celiac patients. Provided that further studies confirm a favorable safety profile through strategies designed to minimize off-target actions, ML-7 or related MLCK inhibitors may represent an important therapeutic approach to ameliorate intestinal barrier defects and blunt the inflammatory cascade triggered by gliadin exposure. The comprehensive preclinical evidence supports the continued pursuit of ML-7 as a proof-of-concept agent for celiac disease, while also highlighting the need for future work to optimize its selectivity and delivery for eventual clinical application (Jin & Blikslager, 2020; Yao et al., 2020; Zuo et al., 2023).

In light of the available data, the repurposing of ML-7 for celiac disease presents both an exciting opportunity and a challenge. The compelling mechanistic rationale based on MLCK inhibition, coupled with strong experimental evidence from in vitro models, provides a solid foundation for further investigation. At the same time, safety concerns related to kinase inhibitor specificity and systemic distribution must be rigorously addressed before clinical translation can be considered. Overall, ML-7 remains a promising lead compound with significant potential to restore tight junction integrity in celiac disease, and future research should focus on fine-tuning its therapeutic profile through targeted delivery strategies and enhanced selectivity. Such efforts may ultimately result in a novel treatment modality that addresses a fundamental pathological feature—intestinal barrier dysfunction—in a disease where current therapies are limited (Al-Sadi et al., 2008; Turner, 2012; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

This comprehensive evaluation, based on diverse lines of evidence from cellular biochemistry, pharmacology, and clinical research, indicates that ML-7 holds significant promise as a repurposed candidate for intervention in celiac disease. Its use as a molecular tool to inhibit MLCK activity has provided critical insights into the mechanisms that govern epithelial tight junction regulation, and its application in disease models strongly supports a role for MLCK inhibition in restoring barrier integrity. With continued rigorous preclinical work to address outstanding challenges, ML-7 has the potential to advance as a therapeutic modality that could improve clinical outcomes for patients suffering from celiac disease.

Oleanolic acid,"Proposal for Oleanolic acid

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Oleanolic acid (OA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid that is widely distributed in over 2000 plant species, including olive leaves, apple skins, and numerous medicinal herbs. It is a member of the triterpenoid class of compounds, whose unique cyclic structure has long been associated with diverse pharmacological activities, ranging from anti‐inflammatory and antioxidant to hepatoprotective and metabolic regulatory effects (Sen, 2020, pp. 1–2). Traditionally, compounds of this class have been used in herbal medicine for liver protection, anti‐diabetic therapy, and general wellness, in part owing to their overall favorable safety profiles and extensive human dietary exposure. OA was originally discovered and later isolated as a bioactive constituent of many plant extracts, and its structure and synthetic derivatives have been extensively characterized for their ability to modulate immune responses and oxidative pathways. As a repurposed therapeutic candidate, OA belongs to those natural products that have been historically consumed as part of the human diet and have subsequently been investigated for their potential to modulate molecular pathways implicated in various chronic diseases (Sen, 2020, pp. 1–2; Castellano et al., 2013, pp. 1–2).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of oleanolic acid is robust, with a wealth of preclinical studies that have demonstrated its diverse bioactivities. Biochemically, OA has been used in numerous studies as a hepatoprotective agent to reduce liver toxicity induced by chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and acetaminophen (Chen et al., 2014, pp. 26–28). In animal models, it has been shown to ameliorate inflammatory conditions like experimental colitis and autoimmune encephalomyelitis, as well as to counter metabolic dysfunction in diabetes and obesity models (Sen, 2020, pp. 1–2; Castellano et al., 2013, pp. 1–2). Although clinical trial databases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) have yet to yield any studies directly targeting celiac disease, numerous rodent studies in inflammatory bowel models have documented improvements in intestinal barrier integrity and reductions in inflammatory cytokine levels after OA treatment, suggesting possible translational value. Moreover, the compound’s established use in human herbal preparations, its known oral bioavailability when administered with lipophilic matrices, and its favorable safety record in other clinical contexts collectively support further evaluation of OA as a repurposed candidate for celiac disease (Sen, 2020, pp. 1–2; Xue et al., 2022, pp. 1–2).

Mechanism of Action:
Oleanolic acid exerts its biological effects via a multifaceted mechanism of action that encompasses nuclear receptor modulation, inhibition of proinflammatory signaling pathways, and promotion of endogenous antioxidant defenses. One of the key proposed mechanisms is its activity as an agonist for nuclear receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and pregnane X receptor (PXR), which are critically involved in the transcriptional regulation of metabolic, detoxification, and anti-inflammatory genes (Sen, 2020, p. 19). Activation of PPARα by OA is thought to upregulate the expression of genes coding for tight junction proteins, such as claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1, thereby enhancing epithelial barrier integrity. In parallel, PXR activation induces the transcription of detoxification enzymes and transporters that may mitigate xenobiotic stress and inflammation (Sen, 2020, pp. 17–19; Lin et al., 2018, pp. 12–13).

On a molecular level, OA has been documented to activate the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2, thereby enhancing the expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (Castellano et al., 2013, pp. 7–8; Sen, 2020, pp. 5–6). This activation helps counteract oxidative stress, a prominent feature in inflammatory processes and epithelial barrier disruption in diseases like celiac disease. Additionally, OA inhibits the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway, leading to a reduction in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines—for example, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)—which are centrally implicated in cytokine-induced barrier loss (Sen, 2020, pp. 5–6; Gutierrez et al., 2020, pp. 15–16).

Further reinforcing its anti-inflammatory potential, OA modulates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and other signaling cascades, reducing phosphorylation events associated with proinflammatory responses (Dong et al., 2020, pp. 9–10). Moreover, recent studies have indicated that OA can exert beneficial effects on intestinal epithelial cells by preserving tight junction protein localization, as seen in Caco-2 models where OA treatment restored the continuous belt-like pattern of ZO-1 under TNFα challenge (Gutierrez et al., 2020, pp. 10–12). Additionally, oleanolic acid has been shown to reshape gut microbiota composition in rodents by increasing beneficial commensals—such as Lactobacillus and Ruminiclostridium—and decreasing opportunistic pathogens that may otherwise exacerbate intestinal inflammation (Xue et al., 2022, pp. 5–8). Although direct evidence of OA’s participation in upregulating antioxidant gene transcription specifically in intestinal epithelial cells remains to be fully elucidated, the combined literature supports a model in which OA minimizes oxidative injury and inflammatory cytokine production, thereby protecting cellular junctions and barrier integrity (Sen, 2020, pp. 9–10; Castellano et al., 2022, pp. 18–20).

Expected Effect:
For the proposed hypothesis in the context of celiac disease, the expected effect of oleanolic acid is that it will activate PPARα and PXR within intestinal epithelial cells, leading to the transcriptional induction of tight junction proteins and antioxidant enzymes. This activation is predicated on the understanding that nuclear receptors such as PPARα and PXR are intrinsically expressed in intestinal cells and regulate genes involved in barrier maintenance and detoxification (Sen, 2020, p. 19; Lin et al., 2018, pp. 12–13). In practice, under gliadin challenge—a model that mimics the proinflammatory and barrier-disruptive effects observed in celiac disease—OA is expected to mitigate cytokine-induced loss of barrier integrity by upregulating genes encoding claudins, occludins, and ZO-1. Preclinical models of rodent colitis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) have provided evidence that OA treatment can restore transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and reduce paracellular flux, thereby normalizing intestinal permeability (Gutierrez et al., 2020, pp. 10–12; Sen, 2020, pp. 9–10).

Furthermore, by activating Nrf2 through its antioxidant mechanisms, OA is anticipated to enhance the transcription of genes involved in the cellular antioxidant defense system, which will help lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-15. This antioxidant effect is crucial because oxidative stress is a known contributor to the disruption of tight junction proteins in intestinal epithelia (Castellano et al., 2013, pp. 7–8; Sen, 2020, pp. 8–9). In vitro studies using Caco-2 monolayers—which model the intestinal barrier—have shown that treatment with OA prevents the cytokine-induced mislocalization of ZO-1 and preserves barrier function, as measured by TEER and fluorescent dextran permeability assays (Gutierrez et al., 2020, pp. 10–12). Thus, under the experimental conditions involving gliadin stimulation, it is expected that OA will reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines (including IL-15 and TNF-α), restore tight junction integrity, and normalize TEER values, collectively mitigating the epithelial barrier loss characteristic of celiac disease (Sen, 2020, pp. 9–10; Xue et al., 2022, pp. 8–9).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on the comprehensive review of the literature, oleanolic acid presents as a promising candidate for repurposing towards the treatment of celiac disease. Its strengths lie in its natural origin, which is associated with a long history of human dietary exposure and a favorable safety profile, as evidenced by its extensive use in herbal supplements and its administration in prediabetic human studies (Sen, 2020, pp. 1–2; Castellano et al., 2022, pp. 20–21). Its multifaceted mechanism of action, particularly its capacity to activate nuclear receptors such as PPARα and PXR, confer it with the potential to upregulate the expression of tight junction proteins and antioxidant enzymes. This molecular activity is essential for maintaining and restoring intestinal epithelial barrier integrity under inflammatory conditions—a critical pathophysiological feature of celiac disease (Sen, 2020, pp. 17–19; Lin et al., 2018, pp. 12–13).

Additionally, OA’s demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects—mediated via inhibition of the NF-κB pathway and reduction in proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-15—further support its theoretical utility in mitigating the gliadin-induced inflammatory cascade that disrupts intestinal barrier function in celiac disease (Unknown Reference; Dong et al., 2020, pp. 9–10). Preclinical models in rodent colitis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis have provided encouraging data regarding its efficacy in restoring barrier function, normalizing TEER, and modulating the gut microbiota in a manner that supports gut homeostasis (Xue et al., 2022, pp. 5–8; Gutierrez et al., 2020, pp. 1–2).

However, there are notable weaknesses and gaps in the current evidence base. Foremost among these is the absence of any clinical data directly addressing the use of oleanolic acid in celiac disease, as clinical trial searches have yet to return pertinent studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, while several studies support its activity in improving epithelial barrier integrity in rodent models, the translation of these findings to human intestinal biology remains to be fully established. It is also important to note that certain reports have mentioned potential hepatotoxicity under conditions of repeated or high-dose administration in animal models, which underscores the necessity of careful dosing and safety profiling in future clinical investigations (Sen, 2020, pp. 14–15, 25–26).

From a mechanistic perspective, although the activation of PPARα and PXR is hypothesized based on the molecular pharmacology literature, direct evidence in the specific context of intestinal epithelial cells challenged by gliadin is still lacking. Future experiments should be designed to examine whether OA indeed upregulates tight junction proteins such as claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 in human intestinal organoid models exposed to gliadin and whether it concomitantly reduces inflammatory cytokine production (Sen, 2020, pp. 16–17; Gutierrez et al., 2020, pp. 15–16). In addition, the influence of OA on antioxidant gene transcription via Nrf2 activation in the gut needs further elucidation in order to validate its protective effects against oxidative stress-mediated barrier disruption (Castellano et al., 2013, pp. 7–8; Sen, 2020, pp. 9–10).

In summary, oleanolic acid’s pleiotropic effects—its ability to modulate anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways, to activate nuclear receptors involved in barrier protection, and to favorably modulate intestinal microbiota—strongly support its potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease. The comprehensive preclinical evidence, combined with an established safety record in herbal use and emerging clinical data in metabolic conditions, lends significant promise to this candidate. Nonetheless, substantial gaps remain, particularly the need for data on its direct effects in celiac disease models and the determination of optimal dosing strategies that avoid potential toxicities. Given these considerations, while the current evidence is promising and supports further preclinical investigation, rigorous studies in human-relevant models and subsequent clinical trials will be essential to fully validate oleanolic acid as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease (Sen, 2020, pp. 17–19; Gutierrez et al., 2020, pp. 10–12; Xue et al., 2022, pp. 5–8; Lin et al., 2018, pp. 12–13).

Gö6976 (PKCα inhibitor),"Proposal for Gö6976 (PKCα inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Gö6976 is a synthetic small-molecule inhibitor that was originally developed to selectively inhibit conventional protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms—most notably PKCα, and to a lesser extent PKCβ. It is commercially available (e.g., catalog #G116 from Sigma) and has been characterized in biochemical studies to exhibit submicromolar inhibition of PKCα with minimal activity against other PKC isoforms. Gö6976 belongs to the class of kinase inhibitors that modulate intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those involved in phosphorylation events which regulate cytoskeletal organization and tight junction (TJ) dynamics. Chemical synthesis of Gö6976 followed conventional approaches for generating small-molecule inhibitors targeting the catalytic site of protein kinases; its design was based on the structure of active PKC complexes and subsequent structure–activity relationship studies. Members of this group have been extensively used in in vitro signaling studies to delineate the roles of PKC isoforms in processes such as epithelial barrier regulation and tight junction assembly (Andreeva, 2004; Song et al., 2001).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Gö6976 and related conventional PKC inhibitors have been applied in preclinical settings to assess the role of PKC isoforms in various cellular processes, including epithelial transport, junctional complex assembly, and cytoskeletal dynamics. In several in vitro studies using epithelial cell lines such as MDCK cells and T84 intestinal epithelial cells, Gö6976 has been employed to probe the regulation of tight junction proteins like occludin and ZO-1. Notably, these studies have demonstrated that modulation of PKC activity directly impacts transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and tight junction integrity (Andreeva, 2004; Song et al., 2001). Although a number of clinical trials have explored antisense strategies and other PKC inhibitors in oncology (e.g., the ISIS 3521 trial in lung cancer; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2000), there is no direct clinical record of Gö6976 being used for celiac disease or related disorders. Nevertheless, the mechanistic role of PKCα in modulating tight junction dynamics makes Gö6976 a compelling candidate for repurposing in intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction—a central pathological feature of celiac disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2000).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, PKCα is a calcium-dependent isoform of the PKC family that plays a critical role in phosphorylating tight junction proteins and orchestrating cytoskeletal reorganization. In the context of celiac disease, exposure to gliadin peptides has been shown to trigger the release of zonulin, a protein that modulates epithelial tight junctions via activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and phospholipase C (PLC) pathways. This zonulin–EGFR–PLC cascade ultimately leads to the activation of PKCα, which phosphorylates key tight junction components such as ZO-1 and occludin. Phosphorylation events mediated by PKCα contribute to the internalization and disassembly of these proteins, thereby increasing intestinal paracellular permeability (Fasano, 2008; Sturgeon & Fasano, 2016). Gö6976, by selectively inhibiting PKCα, is hypothesized to interrupt this phosphorylative cascade downstream of zonulin signalling. Notably, in vitro investigations using epithelial models have shown that inhibition of conventional PKC isoforms by Gö6976 can result in enhanced redistribution of occludin to intercellular contacts and promote tight junction assembly (Andreeva, 2004). In this proposed mechanism, Gö6976 would block PKCα-mediated phosphorylation of TJ proteins, thus preventing their internalization and preserving the structural integrity of the epithelial barrier under conditions of gliadin challenge.

Expected Effect:
In the assay proposed—using gluten-exposed intestinal organoids or other epithelial models—it is expected that Gö6976 will effectively block the PKCα-driven dissociation of tight junction components. Mechanistically, by inhibiting PKCα activation, Gö6976 should prevent the phosphorylation-induced disassembly of occludin and ZO-1, which are essential for maintaining a high transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and low paracellular permeability. In gluten challenge models, where gliadin triggers zonulin release that in turn destabilizes tight junctions, the administration of Gö6976 is anticipated to preserve the localization of TJ proteins at the cell membrane. This should manifest as measurable increases in TEER and reductions in macromolecular permeability (e.g., FITC-dextran flux assays). Gene and protein expression profiling in intestinal epithelial cells also indicate that PKCα and its associated signaling molecules are upregulated upon gliadin exposure (Caviglia et al., 2019), which supports the rationale that selective inhibition by Gö6976 will counteract these pathological changes. Given that PKCα is known to be expressed in epithelial cell models such as Caco-2 and organoid systems, the expected effect is the restoration and stabilization of intestinal barrier function under stress conditions induced by gliadin (Fasano, 2008; Song et al., 2001).

Overall Evaluation:
The evaluation of Gö6976 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease is supported by a strong mechanistic rationale and preclinical biochemical data regarding the regulation of tight junctions by PKCα. One of the major strengths of this approach is that it targets a well-defined signaling node within the zonulin–EGFR–PLC pathway, which is known to modulate tight junction dynamics and epithelial barrier permeability—the core pathological events in celiac disease. The submicromolar potency of Gö6976 and its selectivity for PKCα suggest that it could effectively prevent the phosphorylation-mediated disassembly of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 and occludin, thereby maintaining barrier integrity under gluten challenge (Fasano, 2008; Sturgeon & Fasano, 2016).

Additionally, existing in vitro studies using epithelial cell models support the concept that inhibition of conventional PKCs, particularly PKCα, can lead to enhanced tight junction assembly and functional barrier preservation (Andreeva, 2004; Song et al., 2001). The experimental paradigm of using TEER and FITC-dextran permeability as readouts in intestinal organoids or epithelial monolayers provides a sound method to evaluate the efficacy of Gö6976 in preserving barrier function under inflammatory or gluten-induced stress (Caviglia et al., 2019).

However, there are also notable weaknesses and uncertainties regarding its potential use in celiac disease. First, while there is a solid theoretical basis for targeting PKCα, the complex interplay of PKC isoforms within epithelial cells means that inhibition of one isoform could have unforeseen compensatory effects. In some models, conventional PKC inhibition has even been associated with improved TJ assembly, while in other contexts, PKC activity may be required for protective barrier functions (Andreeva, 2004; Farhadi et al., 2006). Moreover, most of the preclinical data supporting Gö6976’s action come from non-intestinal epithelial models (e.g., MDCK cells) or from in vitro assays that might not fully capture the complexities of the intestinal microenvironment in celiac disease (Caviglia et al., 2019).

Second, while Gö6976 has acceptable pharmacokinetics in rodent barrier studies, there is limited information regarding its pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles in the context of chronic gastrointestinal disorders like celiac disease. Previous clinical applications of PKC inhibitors have predominantly been in oncology (as seen in the ISIS 3521 studies in NSCLC) and not in intestinal barrier modulation, raising potential issues regarding translation to a new therapeutic area (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2000).

Furthermore, a potential risk is that inhibition of PKCα might interfere with other physiological processes in the gut, such as normal epithelial turnover, immune signaling, or responses to luminal microbes. The literature underscores the complexity and redundancy in the signaling pathways that govern tight junction dynamics, and thus it is critical to determine whether long-term inhibition of PKCα might lead to unintended consequences.

In summary, Gö6976 as a selective PKCα inhibitor shows promise based on its mechanistic alignment with the zonulin–EGFR–PLC signaling axis, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of celiac disease due to gluten-induced barrier dysfunction. The preclinical evidence from biochemical and cellular studies supports its potential to promote tight junction integrity and reduce permeability under gliadin challenge conditions (Fasano, 2008; Song et al., 2001). Despite these promising aspects, critical gaps remain regarding its in vivo efficacy in relevant celiac disease models, comprehensive pharmacokinetic data, and long-term safety profiles in the gastrointestinal context. These weaknesses indicate that while Gö6976 is a compelling candidate for further investigation, extensive preclinical studies, including rigorous intestinal organoid models and in vivo gluten challenge studies, are warranted before proceeding with clinical trials in celiac disease patients. Overall, the strengths of mechanistic specificity and prior supportive biochemical data are balanced by uncertainties in translational efficacy and safety; hence, Gö6976 merits further targeted research as a potential therapeutic for preserving epithelial barrier function in celiac disease (Sturgeon & Fasano, 2016; Fasano, 2008; Andreeva, 2004; Caviglia et al., 2019).

Apigenin,"Proposal for Apigenin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Apigenin is a naturally occurring plant-derived flavone characterized chemically as 4′,5,7-trihydroxyflavone. It is widely distributed in common dietary sources such as parsley, chamomile, celery, spinach, artichokes, and oregano. In nature, apigenin is generally present as glycosides, which undergo enzymatic hydrolysis in the gastrointestinal tract to yield the free aglycone form responsible for its bioactivity (DeRango-Adem & Blay, 2021). As a member of the flavonoid class—a subgroup of polyphenolic compounds well known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties—apigenin has been extensively studied in both preclinical and biochemical research settings. Its classification as a Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class II compound is based on its high membrane permeability but limited water solubility, necessitating the development of advanced formulation strategies to improve its solubility and bioavailability (Tang, Chen, Huang, & Li, 2017). The historical recognition of the health-beneficial effects of flavonoids has spurred significant interest in repurposing compounds such as apigenin as nutraceuticals and therapeutic agents, particularly for diseases involving chronic inflammation and epithelial barrier dysfunction (Ginwala, Bhavsar, Chigbu, Jain, & Khan, 2019). Its discovery through systematic phytochemical screening and subsequent pharmacokinetic and mechanistic studies has laid the groundwork for its consideration as a candidate to protect intestinal barrier integrity—especially in pathologies where inflammatory insults compromise epithelial tight junctions.

Therapeutic History:
Historically, apigenin has been the focus of numerous preclinical studies investigating its extensive anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. In various gastrointestinal cancer models, apigenin has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis, demonstrating its chemopreventive potential (Lefort & Blay, 2013). In addition, experimental models of colitis have provided compelling evidence that apigenin can reduce inflammation by modulating the release of cytokines and restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier (Ai et al., 2017). For instance, in rodent models simulating colitis, its administration resulted in a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), alongside histological improvements in colonic tissues (Patil et al., 2015). Its efficacy is not limited to gastrointestinal conditions; apigenin has also been evaluated in models of lung inflammation, vascular dysfunction, and even topical applications for dermatological disorders. Despite its broad preclinical utility, a formal evaluation of apigenin specifically for celiac disease or gluten-induced intestinal injury has not been performed, as evidenced by a comprehensive search on ClinicalTrials.gov—no trials have been registered under “apigenin AND (celiac disease OR gluten)” (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nonetheless, the documented benefits in conditions characterized by epithelial inflammation and barrier disruption—such as those seen in dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis models—provide a strong rationale for exploring its application in celiac disease, a condition in which gluten exposure triggers an inflammatory cascade and compromises epithelial integrity (Allemailem et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
Apigenin exerts its biological effects through multiple overlapping pathways that converge on reducing inflammation and stabilizing cellular barriers. One of its most well-characterized actions is the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), a transcription factor central to the regulation of inflammatory responses. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced models of inflammation, apigenin reduces the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, thereby limiting the transcription of several pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 (Patil et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014). Furthermore, its suppressive effect extends to upstream kinases including IκB kinase subunits IKKα and IKKɛ, which are essential for NF-κB activation under pro-inflammatory conditions such as high glucose levels and TNF-α stimulation (Yamagata, Miyashita, Matsufuji, & Chino, 2010).

In addition to its actions on NF-κB, apigenin impacts the STAT3 signaling pathway. Studies in colonic inflammation models have demonstrated that apigenin reduces STAT3 phosphorylation, thereby disrupting interleukin-6 (IL-6)-driven positive feedback loops that sustain inflammatory signaling in tissues affected by chronic inflammation (Ai et al., 2017). This dual inhibition of NF-κB and STAT3 provides a potent anti-inflammatory effect that may be essential for mitigating the immune-mediated epithelial damage seen in celiac disease.

A further critical mechanism relevant to the proposed hypothesis centers on the regulation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Under inflammatory conditions, upregulation of MLCK leads to the phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain, which in turn triggers cytoskeletal contractions and ultimately results in the disassembly of tight junctions composed of proteins such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin. Although direct evidence of apigenin acting as a robust MLCK inhibitor in intestinal epithelial cells is less abundant than its documented effects on NF-κB, several preclinical studies suggest that apigenin promotes tight junction stability. In models of colitis and oxidative stress-induced intestinal injury, apigenin treatment has been associated with increased expression and correct localization of tight junction proteins and concomitant improvements in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) (Allemailem et al., 2024). It is plausible that by curtailing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines—many of which are known to upregulate MLCK—apigenin indirectly results in reduced MLCK activity, thereby helping to preserve epithelial barrier integrity (Zulkifli, Ismail, Peng, Jailani, & Kassim, 2019).

Additionally, apigenin has been found to trigger antioxidant defense mechanisms via the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Upon activation, Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus and upregulates the transcription of various antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX). These enzymes serve to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing oxidative stress—a known aggravator of barrier dysfunction and MLCK activation (Sanchez-Marzo et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022). Thus, the combined anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions of apigenin help to establish a more favorable cellular environment for the maintenance of tight junction integrity in intestinal epithelial cells.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underlying the repurposing of apigenin for celiac disease is founded on its ability to simultaneously inhibit pro-inflammatory signaling pathways and stabilize epithelial barrier function. In a gliadin-challenged experimental setup—whether using intestinal organoids or well-differentiated epithelial cell monolayers—it is expected that apigenin administration will produce several convergent beneficial outcomes. First, by inhibiting NF-κB activation, apigenin should lower the expression and secretion of key pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, which are typically elevated following exposure to immunogenic gluten peptides (DeRango-Adem & Blay, 2021; Ai et al., 2017). This cytokine reduction is crucial because these mediators drive the inflammatory cascade that contributes to epithelial damage and MLCK upregulation.

Second, it is anticipated that apigenin will prevent or reverse the pathological upregulation of MLCK that is commonly observed in states of chronic inflammation. MLCK activation results in the phosphorylation of myosin light chains, promoting the contraction of the actomyosin ring and disassembly of the intercellular tight junction complexes. Through direct or indirect pathways—principally via reduction of the pro-inflammatory milieu—apigenin is expected to decrease MLCK activity, thereby preserving or restoring the expression and proper localization of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 and occludin. This restoration should be reflected by increases in TEER measurements, indicative of a tightened epithelial barrier (Allemailem et al., 2024).

In parallel, apigenin’s antioxidant properties via Nrf2 activation will minimize ROS-induced cellular stress, further contributing to the maintenance of barrier function. The net effect of these actions in gliadin-challenged models would be reduced permeability of the intestinal epithelium, decreased presentation of immunogenic gluten peptides, and ultimately a mitigation of the autoimmune cascade instigated by gluten exposure (Zhou et al., 2022). In summary, the expected outcome is a dual therapeutic action: suppression of inflammatory signaling via NF-κB (and possibly STAT3) inhibition coupled with improved epithelial barrier integrity through reduced MLCK activity and enhanced tight junction protein functionality.

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating apigenin as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease, several compelling factors emerge alongside notable challenges. One of the greatest strengths of apigenin is its extensive preclinical validation; its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties have been consistently demonstrated in multiple disease models, including gastrointestinal and colonic inflammation (DeRango-Adem & Blay, 2021; Ginwala et al., 2019; Ai et al., 2017). These attributes are particularly valuable in the context of celiac disease, where chronic inflammation and disruption of the epithelial barrier are central to pathogenesis. Furthermore, apigenin’s ability to modulate key signaling pathways such as NF-κB and STAT3 not only downregulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines but also indirectly influences other regulators of barrier integrity, such as MLCK (Patil et al., 2015; Allemailem et al., 2024).

Another major strength is the favorable toxicity profile of apigenin. Being a naturally occurring compound found in everyday dietary sources, apigenin is generally regarded as safe at nutritional and moderately supra-nutritional doses. Its capacity for oral administration and membrane permeability make it an attractive candidate for development as a nutraceutical or adjunct therapeutic agent. Moreover, its antioxidant activity through Nrf2 activation further strengthens its candidacy by offering protection against oxidative stress—a known aggravator of barrier dysfunction—in the gut (Sanchez-Marzo et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022).

Despite these strengths, significant challenges and knowledge gaps remain. Most notably, direct evidence for apigenin’s efficacy in the context of celiac disease is currently lacking. While preclinical models of colitis have demonstrated improvements in barrier integrity and reductions in inflammatory markers, specific studies targeting gliadin-induced epithelial damage and immune activation in celiac disease models are absent. This gap is underscored by the absence of registered clinical trials exploring apigenin’s impact on celiac disease or gluten-related pathologies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while indirect evidence supports the notion that apigenin may downregulate MLCK activity via suppression of NF-κB, direct mechanistic studies confirming its inhibitory effect on MLCK expression or activity in intestinal epithelial cells are sparse (Allemailem et al., 2024; Zulkifli et al., 2019).

Another limitation arises from the inherent physicochemical properties of apigenin. Its low water solubility poses a formulation challenge that may limit its oral bioavailability. Although strategies such as nanoencapsulation, liposomal delivery, and polymer-based carriers are being investigated to overcome these hurdles (Tang et al., 2017), additional formulation development will be necessary before therapeutically relevant concentrations can be achieved in the intestinal epithelium.

Finally, while the anti-inflammatory and barrier-protective effects of apigenin have been well demonstrated in non-celiac models, the multifactorial nature of celiac disease—as it involves genetic predispositions (HLA-DQ2/DQ8), adaptive immune responses to gluten peptides, and other environmental factors—means that translating these benefits into a clinical setting may be inherently challenging. Rigorous mechanistic studies using gliadin-challenged intestinal organoids or cell culture models, followed by carefully designed animal studies, will be required to establish whether apigenin can indeed restore tight junction integrity and suppress MLCK-mediated disruptions in celiac disease.

In conclusion, apigenin stands out as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of celiac disease due to its well-documented anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and barrier-stabilizing properties. Its ability to inhibit NF-κB and potentially reduce MLCK-mediated disruption of tight junctions presents a strong mechanistic rationale for its use in conditions characterized by epithelial barrier dysfunction. However, while the preclinical evidence in related models is supportive, the lack of direct data in celiac disease models and existing challenges in formulation and bioavailability represent critical hurdles that must be overcome. The cumulative evidence thus supports further investigation through detailed mechanistic studies and preclinical evaluations specifically targeting gliadin-induced epithelial damage. Should these studies confirm the hypothesized effects on MLCK expression, tight junction protein localization, and TEER normalization, apigenin could advance to clinical trials as a novel, adjunctive nutraceutical agent aimed at protecting the intestinal barrier in celiac disease (DeRango-Adem & Blay, 2021; Allemailem et al., 2024; Ginwala et al., 2019; Ai et al., 2017). Overall, given its safety profile, natural origins, and demonstrated efficacy in mitigating inflammation and barrier dysfunction in related contexts, apigenin warrants comprehensive preclinical studies to evaluate its potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate in the management of celiac disease.

"ENMD-1068 (PAR2 antagonist)

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of ENMD-1068 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease based on the available literature data.","Proposal for ENMD-1068 (PAR2 antagonist)

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of ENMD-1068 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease based on the available literature data.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
ENMD-1068 is a synthetically derived, small-molecule antagonist that selectively targets protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), which belongs to the class of non-peptidic PAR2 modulators. The compound was discovered through structure–activity relationship studies that recapitulated features of the receptor’s endogenous tethered ligand sequence, and it has been optimized in medicinal chemistry efforts to achieve a defined inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) near 16 μM in epithelial inflammation models (Azouz et al., 2020; McIntosh et al., 2020). PAR2 antagonists have been developed over the last few decades to modulate the signaling of this G protein–coupled receptor that is widely implicated in the regulation of inflammatory processes and barrier dysfunction. In general, small-molecule antagonists in this class are synthesized by elaborating on lead structures based on proteolytic cleavage sites or mimicking the endogenous inhibitor motif, and they have been used in various experimental settings to abrogate PAR2-mediated responses in tissues such as the esophageal epithelium and intestinal mucosa (Catalioto et al., 2011; Khaleghi et al., 2016). In addition, the optimized preclinical pharmacokinetic profiles of ENMD-1068 facilitate rational dose selection in vivo, including in transgenic animal models that closely mimic human celiac disease genetics such as HLA-DQ8 mice. This candidate, therefore, represents a rationally engineered chemical entity that fits within a broader class of PAR2 antagonists developed to block receptor-mediated signaling cascades that drive inflammatory and barrier-disruptive processes.

Therapeutic History
The primary evaluation of ENMD-1068 thus far has been in preclinical systems focusing on epithelial inflammation. In earlier studies, compounds from the PAR2 antagonist class were mostly explored in contexts such as allergic inflammation and esophageal epithelial barrier dysfunction, where PAR2 signaling has been shown to mediate cellular inflammatory responses and tight junction disruption (Catalioto et al., 2011). Specifically, studies investigating epithelial inflammation models have demonstrated that small-molecule PAR2 antagonists can block receptor cleavage and attenuate downstream calcium signaling, thereby reducing cytokine release and cellular rearrangement (Azouz et al., 2020). Although many compounds from this class have faced challenges such as moderate potency and off-target effects at high concentrations, ENMD-1068 appears to be among those with a clearer pharmacokinetic profile and a defined mechanism of action that make it a candidate for repurposing. Notably, there are no registered clinical trials to date on ClinicalTrials.gov specifically evaluating ENMD-1068 or related PAR2 antagonists for celiac disease, gluten-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction, or associated conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, while other drug classes—including zonulin receptor antagonists such as larazotide acetate and enzyme therapies like latiglutenase—have been more extensively tested in clinical and translational settings for maintaining gut barrier integrity (Khaleghi et al., 2016; Machado, 2023), no direct application of ENMD-1068 has been reported in clinical or veterinary settings for celiac disease or gluten-related disorders. Thus, previous therapeutic uses of PAR2 antagonists have been limited largely to preclinical evaluations in similar barrier dysfunction models, but they provide an important proof-of-concept that targeting this receptor could help restore epithelial junction integrity during inflammatory challenges (Catalioto et al., 2011; Khaleghi et al., 2016).

Mechanism of Action
The molecular rationale for using ENMD-1068 in celiac disease hinges on the well-documented role of PAR2 in regulating intestinal epithelial barrier function. PAR2 is a G protein–coupled receptor expressed on a broad range of cell types, including intestinal epithelial cells, and is activated by proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular N-terminal domain, which unmasks a tethered ligand that in turn activates intracellular signals. In epithelial cells, PAR2 activation interfaces with the zonulin pathway–a critical modulator of tight junctions. When gluten peptides, particularly gliadin, stimulate zonulin release, zonulin binds to receptors on the epithelial cell surface (including PAR2), triggering a cascade that involves epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation (Patt et al., 2023; Valitutti & Fasano, 2019). This process activates phospholipase C (PLC) leading to calcium influx, which in turn activates protein kinase C alpha (PKCα). Activated PKCα phosphorylates tight junction proteins such as occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), leading to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and ultimately to tight junction disassembly and increased paracellular permeability. ENMD-1068 exerts its action by binding to PAR2 and preventing its protease-mediated cleavage and subsequent receptor activation. By doing so, it blocks the initial trigger for the downstream cascade involving EGFR transactivation, PLC-mediated calcium signaling, and PKCα-driven phosphorylation events necessary for junction disassembly (Azouz et al., 2020; Patt et al., 2023). At the molecular level, ENMD-1068’s specificity for PAR2 is critical because it ensures that only the pathological activation of this receptor is inhibited without broadly suppressing other signaling pathways. The presence of PAR2 on intestinal epithelial cells, confirmed in various epithelial models such as Caco-2 cell monolayers and intestinal organoids, supports the relevance of this mechanism (Ailioaie et al., 2022; Catalioto et al., 2011). Furthermore, by mitigating the actin cytoskeletal rearrangement normally seen downstream of PAR2 activation, ENMD-1068 may help preserve the distribution and function of tight junction proteins whose loss is central to the pathogenesis of celiac disease (Patt et al., 2023). Thus, at a biochemical level, this agent has been designed to interrupt a well-defined series of events starting at PAR2 activation and culminating in barrier dysfunction.

Expected Effect
The expected therapeutic effect of ENMD-1068 in the context of celiac disease revolves around its ability to prevent the gluten-induced disruption of epithelial barrier integrity in the gut. Gluten peptides, particularly those derived from gliadin, are known to stimulate zonulin release from intestinal epithelial cells. Zonulin then acts on receptors including PAR2 and triggers a cascade leading to EGFR transactivation, PLC-mediated calcium flux, and PKCα activation. This signaling cascade results in the phosphorylation and internalization of tight junction proteins such as occludin and ZO-1, ultimately causing actin cytoskeletal rearrangement and tight junction disassembly. The disruption of tight junctions increases intestinal permeability, allowing more gliadin and other luminal antigens to traverse the epithelium and activate immune responses, thereby perpetuating celiac disease pathology (Yoosuf & Makharia, 2019; Massironi et al., 2024).

Under the proposed assay conditions, such as those using established Caco-2 cell monolayers or intestinal organoid systems, ENMD-1068 is expected to preserve junctional integrity even in the presence of gluten challenge. Treated cells should exhibit reduced phosphorylation of occludin and ZO-1, less actin reorganization, and maintain a tighter barrier compared to untreated controls exposed to gliadin peptides. In vivo, when tested in HLA-DQ8 transgenic mouse models that recapitulate many of the clinical features of celiac disease, administration of ENMD-1068 is anticipated to result in a lower lactulose:mannitol excretion ratio, a surrogate marker for improved intestinal permeability, along with reduced cytokine expression and diminished inflammatory cell infiltration (Machado, 2023; Patt et al., 2023). Because epithelial cells in the gut express PAR2 along with other zonulin receptors, blocking PAR2 may not only preserve tight junction integrity but also minimize subsequent immune activation resulting from antigen translocation. This multifunctional effect is crucial because preserving the barrier limits the immune system’s exposure to luminal gluten peptides, which is a cornerstone in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. In addition, earlier data in epithelial inflammation models have shown that blocking PAR2 can reduce intracellular calcium flux and the expression of pro‐inflammatory mediators, providing further support for the expected protective effect in assays (Azouz et al., 2020; Yoosuf & Makharia, 2019).

Overall Evaluation
In summary, the evaluation of ENMD-1068 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease yields a cautiously optimistic outlook. On the strength side, ENMD-1068 is built on a robust biochemical rationale. The compound’s mechanism—antagonizing PAR2 to prevent the zonulin-mediated cascade that leads to tight junction disassembly—is directly relevant to the key pathophysiologic event of increased intestinal permeability observed in celiac disease (Patt et al., 2023; Veres-Székely et al., 2023). The scientific premise is further reinforced by numerous studies that underscore the role of PAR2 in regulating the integrity of epithelial cell junctions, particularly in gastrointestinal tissues where barrier dysfunction is a hallmark of disease (Catalioto et al., 2011; Yoosuf & Makharia, 2019).

Another strength is the defined pharmacokinetic profile of ENMD-1068, which has already been characterized in preclinical models and allows for rational dose selection in HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice—a model that closely mimics the genetic predisposition seen in human celiac disease (McIntosh et al., 2020). This preclinical data is critical because it informs the translational potential of the compound, paving the way for future clinical studies if efficacy is demonstrated in robust cellular and animal models.

The use of established in vitro models such as Caco-2 cells and intestinal organoids—both of which express PAR2 and relevant tight junction proteins—provides confidence that the downstream signaling events targeted by ENMD-1068 are indeed operational in the chosen assay systems (Ailioaie et al., 2022; Catalioto et al., 2011). These models have been instrumental in delineating the role of zonulin and PAR2 in barrier dysfunction and serve as valuable platforms for testing the drug’s protective effects against gluten-induced injury.

However, there are also several weaknesses and areas of concern that must be acknowledged. First, despite the defined mechanism of action, the moderate in vitro potency of ENMD-1068 (IC₅₀ ~16 μM) raises concerns about whether sufficient receptor occupancy can be achieved in vivo without triggering off-target effects. A potency in the high micromolar range may limit the therapeutic window and requires careful optimization of dosing regimens to ensure efficacy while avoiding toxicity (Azouz et al., 2020; Al, 2018).

Another challenge is that although preclinical studies in epithelial inflammation models have shown that PAR2 antagonism can improve barrier function, there is as yet no direct evidence that ENMD-1068 can specifically reverse the pathological changes observed in celiac disease. Unlike other compounds such as larazotide acetate—which has been extensively tested in clinical trial settings—ENMD-1068 remains confined to preclinical evaluations, and no clinical trials have been registered that specifically test its efficacy in celiac disease or other gluten-related disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This gap in translational research calls for rigorous preclinical studies utilizing relevant models of gluten challenge to firmly establish proof-of-concept before moving into clinical applications.

Furthermore, prior efforts to target the zonulin pathway have encountered challenges, including variable responses in permeability assays and incomplete blockade of barrier dysfunction even with agents such as larazotide acetate (Khaleghi et al., 2016; Massironi et al., 2024). These issues underscore the inherent complexity of intestinal barrier regulation, where multiple redundant pathways may compensate for the blocked signaling of a single receptor. Thus, it will be essential to determine whether a selective blockade of PAR2 with ENMD-1068 is sufficient to produce a clinically meaningful improvement in tight junction integrity and whether it may need to be combined with other therapeutic modalities (Valitutti & Fasano, 2019; Yoosuf & Makharia, 2019).

Another consideration is the physiological role of PAR2 in normal cellular processes. PAR2 is not exclusively a mediator of pathological signaling; it also contributes to normal immune and repair processes. Therefore, long-term inhibition of PAR2 must be assessed carefully for potential side effects, including the disruption of protective mechanisms or the activation of compensatory pathways that could diminish overall efficacy (Yau et al., 2016; Veres-Székely et al., 2023).

Overall, the evaluation of ENMD-1068 as a repurposed candidate for celiac disease is supported by a strong mechanistic rationale that directly targets a central event in disease pathogenesis—namely, the zonulin/PAR2-EGFR signaling cascade that leads to tight junction disassembly and increased intestinal permeability. The experimental support from in vitro epithelial models and the availability of detailed pharmacokinetic data lend credibility to the concept. Nonetheless, challenges related to moderate potency, the absence of direct preclinical efficacy data in celiac disease models, and potential concerns about the physiological roles of PAR2 underscore the need for comprehensive further studies. In particular, detailed experiments in Caco-2 cells, intestinal organoids, and HLA-DQ8 mice will be critical to validate that ENMD-1068 can indeed prevent gluten‐induced barrier disruption without compromising normal epithelial function. If these preclinical investigations yield favorable outcomes, ENMD-1068 could provide a valuable adjunctive treatment to the gluten-free diet, especially for patients with refractory celiac disease or those in whom incomplete mucosal healing persists despite strict dietary management (Patt et al., 2023; Massironi et al., 2024).

BAY 11-7082 (IKK/NF-κB inhibitor),"Proposal for BAY 11-7082 (IKK/NF-κB inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
BAY 11-7082 is a synthetic small molecule originally synthesized in 1968 that belongs to the class of covalent inhibitors targeting the NF-κB pathway. Its chemical structure is defined by an electrophilic vinyl sulfone moiety incorporating an α,β-unsaturated sulfonyl group, a typical Michael acceptor functional group that permits irreversible covalent binding to nucleophilic sites—particularly cysteine residues—on target proteins (Bertinaria et al., 2019, pp. 15–21). This compound was initially characterized for its ability to block IκB kinase (IKK) activity and, consequently, prevent the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, thereby impeding the nuclear translocation of NF-κB dimers. As such, BAY 11-7082 is commonly used as a tool compound in cell-based assays to study signal transduction pathways in inflammation and has become a prototypical representative of covalent NF-κB inhibitors. Its chemical class has historically been exploited in academic and preclinical settings to dissect inflammatory signaling cascades and has demonstrated utility in models of cancer, neurodegeneration, and immune-mediated diseases (Karin et al., 2004, pp. 1–2; Nakanishi & Toi, 2005, pp. 10–11). By virtue of its well-defined synthetic origins and straightforward chemical characteristics that enable covalent modification, BAY 11-7082 has been extensively utilized to interrogate NF-κB-controlled transcription events that drive the expression of numerous proinflammatory mediators.

Therapeutic History:
BAY 11-7082 has a long precedent as a research tool in the biochemical dissection of inflammatory signaling. It has been extensively employed in vitro at low micromolar concentrations to effectively block NF-κB activation by preventing IκBα phosphorylation in various cell types, including epithelial and immune cells (Bernardo et al., 2012, pp. 21–26). Notably, investigations in celiac disease have demonstrated that untreated patients exhibit elevated NF-κB/DNA binding activity in small intestinal biopsies, with increased nuclear translocation of NF-κB p50/p65 observed in both epithelial and lamina propria mononuclear cells (Abignente, n.d., pp. 86–99). Although BAY 11-7082 itself has not been used directly in clinical trials for celiac disease, its mode of action has been conceptually validated by studies utilizing other NF-κB inhibitors and antioxidants that modulate the same signaling pathway in ex vivo duodenal biopsy models (Bernardo et al., 2012, pp. 21–26). In addition, BAY 11-7082 has been evaluated for its ability to disrupt inflammasome activation in immune cells and, given its NF-κB inhibitory capacity, it has been widely cited in literature addressing inflammation-related barrier dysfunction in gastrointestinal and other barrier disorders (Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 15–16; Hu et al., 2018, pp. 15–18). Preclinical models of inflammatory diseases, including fibrotic conditions and even certain models of cancer, have benefited from its use as a pharmacologic probe, although its direct application in gastrointestinal diseases such as celiac disease remains to be fully explored. In addition, studies in conditions featuring epithelial barrier dysfunction—including data in intestinal cell lines and preclinical animal models of irritable bowel syndrome—support the notion that agents capable of inhibiting NF-κB activation could ameliorate tight junction disruption, reinforcing the potential translational relevance of BAY 11-7082 (Coles et al., 2021, pp. 1–4; Du et al., 2016, pp. 3–4).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary known mechanism of action for BAY 11-7082 is its covalent inhibition of IκB kinase (IKK), which is a pivotal component of the canonical NF-κB activation pathway. Under physiological conditions, NF-κB is maintained in the cytoplasm in a latent state by binding to inhibitory proteins collectively known as IκB. Upon stimulation by proinflammatory signals such as TNF-α, IL-1β, or even gliadin peptides in the context of celiac disease, IKK phosphorylates IκBα, marking it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This degradation frees NF-κB, allowing its translocation to the nucleus where it drives the transcription of its target genes, including proinflammatory cytokines, enzymes, and modulators of cell survival (Karin et al., 2004, pp. 1–2). BAY 11-7082 interferes with this process by covalently binding to reactive cysteine residues in the IKK complex, thereby inhibiting its kinase activity and ultimately stabilizing IκBα in the cytoplasm (Nakanishi & Toi, 2005, pp. 10–11). Moreover, there is evidence that BAY 11-7082 also affects upstream components of the NF-κB pathway by modifying key elements of the ubiquitin system. It has been shown to covalently modify E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes—such as Ubc13 and UbcH7—as well as components of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, further preventing the formation of polyubiquitin chains required for full IKK activation (Bertinaria et al., 2019, pp. 15–21). This dual capacity to inhibit both kinase-dependent phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated signaling events contributes to its potent and sustained blockade of NF-κB activation. Importantly, the inhibitory action of BAY 11-7082 results in decreased nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit and a corresponding reduction in transcriptional activity of NF-κB target genes. Among these target genes are those encoding myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and interleukin-15 (IL-15), both of which have been implicated in mediating epithelial tight junction disruption and consequent barrier loss in the small intestine—a hallmark of celiac disease pathology (Bernardo et al., 2012, pp. 21–26; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 15–16). Mechanistic studies in various cellular models have confirmed that exposure to NF-κB activating stimuli results in marked upregulation of inflammatory mediators, and that covalent inhibitors such as BAY 11-7082 can block these events by stabilizing IκBα, thereby preserving normal cellular homeostasis (Cocco et al., 2017, pp. 9–12). Additionally, reports indicate that BAY 11-7082 may also inhibit modulators of the inflammasome, further reinforcing its multifaceted anti-inflammatory profile (Baldwin et al., 2016, pp. 11–14).

Expected Effect:
In the context of celiac disease, it is hypothesized that exposure of intestinal epithelial cells to gliadin fragments, together with a proinflammatory cytokine milieu, leads to robust activation of the NF-κB pathway. This activation results in increased transcription of genes including MLCK and IL-15, which are known to disrupt the expression and organization of tight junction (TJ) proteins such as occludin, claudins, and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), culminating in compromised epithelial barrier integrity (Abignente, n.d., pp. 86–99; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 15–16). BAY 11-7082 is expected to inhibit IKK activity, thereby preventing the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα. As a direct consequence, NF-κB remains sequestered in the cytoplasm, and the transcription of NF-κB–dependent genes essential for mediating inflammation and barrier disruption is attenuated (Bernardo et al., 2012, pp. 21–26). In experimental assays using epithelial cells such as Caco-2 monolayers or intestinal organoids, one would anticipate that treatment with BAY 11-7082 will lead to measurable increases in cytosolic IκBα levels and a reduction in nuclear accumulation of NF-κB p65. This biochemical shift is expected to result in lower expression levels of MLCK, reducing its ability to phosphorylate myosin regulatory light chains and thereby maintaining the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and TJ complexes. Additionally, diminished NF-κB activity should lead to reduced IL-15 transcription, thereby curtailing further inflammatory signals that contribute to barrier dysfunction (Bernardo et al., 2012, pp. 21–26; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 15–16). This mechanistic intervention should help restore or preserve the expression and localization of key TJ proteins (e.g., occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1), normalizing paracellular permeability and ultimately contributing to the maintenance of intestinal barrier function under conditions that normally provoke inflammation, such as exposure to gliadin peptides.

Overall Evaluation:
BAY 11-7082 offers a scientifically compelling approach for repurposing as a therapeutic candidate in celiac disease due to its well-characterized mechanism of covalent IKK inhibition and subsequent blockade of NF-κB activation. The strengths of BAY 11-7082 lie primarily in its ability to interfere with a critical molecular pathway that is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. NF-κB is a master regulator of inflammation, and its activation in intestinal epithelial cells leads to upregulation of mediators such as MLCK and IL-15 that contribute to tight junction disruption and barrier dysfunction (Abignente, n.d., pp. 86–99; Bernardo et al., 2012, pp. 21–26). By inhibiting IKK, BAY 11-7082 has the potential to prevent these deleterious effects on the epithelial barrier, thereby reducing the intestinal permeability and chronic inflammation that are hallmarks of celiac disease. Its use in various in vitro and preclinical models has provided a robust proof-of-concept that modulation of NF-κB can yield beneficial outcomes in contexts of inflammatory injury (Cocco et al., 2017, pp. 9–12; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 15–16).

However, several weaknesses and challenges must be carefully considered before advancing BAY 11-7082 further in the development pipeline for celiac disease. A significant concern is its intrinsic electrophilic nature, which, while crucial for its covalent binding to IKK, may also confer a propensity for off-target reactivity. BAY 11-7082 has been documented to interact with other cellular proteins, including various E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and E3 ligases, leading to broader suppression of ubiquitination-dependent signaling events (Bertinaria et al., 2019, pp. 15–21, 60–63). Such nonselective interactions could induce unintended cytotoxicity or impact other cellular processes critical for normal cell function. In vitro studies have hinted at cytotoxic effects in some cancer cell lines, potentially stemming from these off-target effects, although these data are not directly extrapolatable to nontransformed intestinal epithelial cells (Strickson et al., 2013, pp. 11–14; Rauert-Wunderlich et al., 2013, pp. 1–3).

Furthermore, despite extensive use in cell-based assays, BAY 11-7082 has not been evaluated in clinical trials or well-defined in vivo models of celiac disease. Its pharmacokinetic properties, bioavailability after oral administration, and systemic safety profile in the context of chronic inflammatory diseases remain largely uncharacterized. These issues are of particular importance when considering long-term therapy for a lifelong condition such as celiac disease, where sustained drug exposure could lead to cumulative toxicity if off-target effects are not adequately controlled. Comparatively, the documented evidence supporting the NF-κB pathway’s dysregulation in celiac disease, including elevated nuclear p65 expression and increased expression of NF-κB–dependent mediators, does support the overall therapeutic rationale; yet, the transition from a research tool to a clinically viable drug candidate requires extensive optimization to mitigate these safety concerns (Prescott & Cook, 2018, pp. 6–8; Hu et al., 2018, pp. 15–18).

Another aspect that merits careful attention is the dosage and potential variability in response among different epithelial cell models. Given the complexity of NF-κB signaling and its role in both pro-inflammatory and cell-survival processes, it is crucial to determine whether BAY 11-7082 can achieve sufficient and sustained NF-κB inhibition in intestinal epithelial cells—such as those found in Caco-2 monolayers or patient-derived organoids—without adversely affecting cell viability or function. Preliminary studies in other models have shown that inhibition of NF-κB signaling can indeed normalize TJ protein expression and reduce cytokine production; however, the optimal therapeutic window for BAY 11-7082 in the gastrointestinal context has not been established (Du et al., 2016, pp. 3–4; Scuderi et al., 2020, pp. 9–11).

Moreover, the multifaceted nature of celiac disease pathogenesis, which involves not only epithelial barrier dysfunction but also an adaptive immune response triggered by gliadin peptides in a genetically predisposed background, adds a layer of complexity. In this scenario, solely targeting NF-κB in epithelial cells may not fully address the immunopathological cascades that drive mucosal destruction and villous atrophy. Combination strategies using BAY 11-7082 with other agents—potentially antioxidants, other immunomodulators, or even agents that strengthen tight junctions directly—might be necessary to achieve a robust therapeutic effect. In this context, thoughtful preclinical study design and stratification of responsive patient subsets will be instrumental in assessing whether NF-κB blockade via BAY 11-7082 can modify disease progression in celiac pathology (Abignente, n.d., pp. 86–99; Bernardo et al., 2012, pp. 21–26).

From a biochemical standpoint, the hypothesis that BAY 11-7082 will reduce the transcription of MLCK, IL-15, and other mediators responsible for TJ disruption is supported by evidence indicating that NF-κB drives the expression of these genes in response to inflammatory stimuli. Studies have demonstrated that exposure to gliadin results in sustained NF-κB activation in the small intestine, correlating with increased expression of inflammatory mediators and subsequent barrier dysfunction (Abignente, n.d., pp. 86–99). In parallel, reports documenting that other NF-κB inhibitors and antioxidants, such as ascorbate, can dampen the mucosal immune response further validate the concept that targeted inhibition of NF-κB may lead to the normalization of epithelial barrier function (Bernardo et al., 2012, pp. 21–26; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 15–16). Additionally, data from cell models show that tight junction integrity is directly related to the expression levels of MLCK and the phosphorylation state of myosin regulatory light chains, supporting the contention that NF-κB blockade would have a beneficial effect on epithelial barrier properties (Cocco et al., 2017, pp. 9–12). This is particularly important in the context of celiac disease, where increased MLCK expression and subsequent tight junction disassembly contribute to enhanced intestinal permeability and ongoing inflammation.

In summary, BAY 11-7082 represents a promising candidate for repurposing in celiac disease on mechanistic grounds. Its ability to act as a covalent inhibitor of IKK and block the NF-κB signaling cascade aligns well with the current understanding of the molecular dysregulation underpinning celiac disease pathogenesis. By inhibiting NF-κB activation, BAY 11-7082 is expected to reduce the expression of key proinflammatory genes, including MLCK and IL-15, which contribute to tight junction disruption and epithelial barrier dysfunction. Its extensive use as a research tool in preclinical settings attests to its potency and robust biochemical profile (Bertinaria et al., 2019, pp. 15–21; Strickson et al., 2013, pp. 10–11).

Nonetheless, significant challenges remain. The potential for off-target effects due to its electrophilic and covalent binding nature raises concerns about cytotoxicity and the inhibition of other essential cellular processes. The lack of extensive in vivo data in models specifically relevant to celiac disease, combined with unknown pharmacokinetic and safety profiles in the gastrointestinal tract, underscores the critical need for further rigorous studies. Detailed dose-response evaluations, assessments of chronic exposure, and the development of more selective analogues could help mitigate some of these concerns. Future research should also explore combination therapeutic strategies that target multiple facets of celiac disease pathology, perhaps pairing BAY 11-7082 with other agents that directly reinforce tight junctions or modulate adaptive immune responses.

From an overall perspective, BAY 11-7082 exhibits significant potential as a repurposed drug candidate for celiac disease based on its well-elucidated biochemical mechanism and its established capacity to block NF-κB signaling—a central driver of inflammation and barrier dysfunction in the disease. Its strengths lie in the solid scientific rationale and the wealth of preclinical data supporting NF-κB’s role in mediating proinflammatory gene expression and tight junction disruption. However, crucial limitations regarding off-target reactivity, potential cytotoxicity, and a dearth of direct in vivo evidence in celiac models must be addressed before clinical translation can be considered. Consequently, while BAY 11-7082 is a promising candidate for further preclinical exploration in intestinal epithelial models challenged with gliadin and proinflammatory cytokines, additional studies focusing on specificity, safety, and optimal dosing are essential to fully validate its potential in the therapeutic landscape of celiac disease (Bernardo et al., 2012, pp. 21–26; Bertinaria et al., 2019, pp. 15–21; Prescott & Cook, 2018, pp. 10–12).

AG1478 (EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor),"Proposal for AG1478 (EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
AG1478 is a synthetic small molecule originally discovered as a selective inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase. Chemically described as 4-(3-chloroanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline, it belongs to the well‐established quinazoline class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This class was developed on the basis of structure–activity relationship studies aimed at targeting the ATP-binding pocket of receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly EGFR, to prevent receptor autophosphorylation and downstream oncogenic signaling (Ellis et al., 2006). AG1478 was synthesized using rational drug design approaches to generate compounds with nanomolar inhibitory potency against EGFR, and its high degree of selectivity has made it a standard research tool for probing EGFR-mediated pathways. Traditionally, compounds of this class have been used as biochemical probes in cancer research to dissect the complexities of EGFR signaling, as well as to serve as leads for the development of clinically approved drugs such as gefitinib and erlotinib (Ellis et al., 2006; Kini, 2012). In addition to its role in cancer studies, AG1478 has been employed extensively in various preclinical settings to evaluate inhibitor kinetics, receptor conformation changes, and combinatorial treatment effects in animal tumor models (Fang et al., 2008). Its well-documented synthesis and structure underpin its continued use as a molecular tool in experimental pharmacology.

Therapeutic History:
Historically, AG1478 has been utilized predominantly in oncological research as an investigative tool rather than as a frontline therapeutic agent. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that it effectively blocks EGFR phosphorylation and downstream signaling cascades, resulting in the suppression of cell proliferation and tumor growth in various cancer cell lines—from colon carcinoma to glioblastoma—as well as in corresponding in vivo xenograft models (Ellis et al., 2006; Gan et al., 2007). Its reversible, ATP-competitive mode of inhibition has been central to many experiments evaluating the antitumor efficacy of EGFR blockade (Johns et al., 2003). Moreover, when used in combination with cytotoxic agents or monoclonal antibodies, AG1478 has been shown to enhance antitumor responses in preclinical models, providing a mechanistic rationale for combining EGFR inhibition with other therapeutic modalities (Johns et al., 2003). Importantly, despite its extensive investigation within the cancer research domain, there is no recorded clinical application or registered clinical trial using AG1478 or similar EGFR inhibitors for the treatment of celiac disease, as evidenced by the negative search result (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Even in comparable disease contexts involving intestinal barrier dysfunction, the use of EGFR inhibitors has not been pursued clinically to date. This therapeutic candidate has similarly not been explored in veterinary applications relating to gut barrier disorders. Therefore, any proposed repurposing of AG1478 for celiac disease would represent a novel application, requiring a thorough reevaluation of its mechanism and potential effects in the complex environment of the inflamed, gluten-exposed gut (Fang et al., 2008; Lenferink et al., 2000).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, AG1478 functions as a competitive inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase. It binds reversibly to the ATP-binding pocket of the receptor’s intracellular kinase domain, thereby preventing ATP from binding and subsequently blocking the receptor’s autophosphorylation events (Ellis et al., 2006). In its role as an inhibitor, AG1478 prevents the activation of downstream signaling pathways that are typically initiated upon ligand binding—for example, the Ras–Raf–MEK–ERK and PI3K–AKT cascades—which are critical for promoting cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Shi et al., 2009). More specifically, in experimental studies using EGFR-overexpressing cell lines including those derived from human epithelial cancers, AG1478 has been shown to suppress the phosphorylation of key tyrosine residues on the receptor; this, in turn, inhibits not only mitogenic proliferation but also ancillary processes such as cell motility and invasion (Fang et al., 2008).

In the context of the current hypothesis for celiac disease, it is proposed that AG1478 can block EGFR transactivation that occurs in response to zonulin signaling via the proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2). Zonulin, when released in response to gliadin peptides, binds to receptors and leads to a cascade of events that involve the activation of PAR2, which then transactivates EGFR. This transactivation is thought to engage downstream signaling pathways mediated by phospholipase C (PLC) and subsequently protein kinase C alpha (PKCα), which cause phosphorylation of tight junction (TJ) proteins and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in increased intestinal permeability (Valitutti & Fasano, 2019; Rao, 2012). Thus, by competitively inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation, AG1478 is expected to interrupt this pathological cascade before PLCγ activation occurs, thereby preventing the PKCα-mediated disruption of TJs. The molecular interactions further involve stabilizing the inactive conformation of EGFR and possibly favoring the formation of unproductive EGFR dimers, as has been previously observed in other preclinical models (Shi et al., 2009; Johns et al., 2003). This detailed mechanistic explanation is further supported by evidence from studies that showed the inhibition of EGFR signaling blocks the phosphorylation events that normally lead to actin reorganization and reduction in epithelial resistance (Wadhwani, 2013). In summary, AG1478 is hypothesized to act at a critical upstream node—EGFR—that links zonulin/PAR2 receptor activation to the downstream biochemical pathways responsible for tight junction disassembly.

Expected Effect:
According to the proposed hypothesis, in gliadin-challenged Caco-2 monolayers and intestinal organoids, the administration of AG1478 should lead to a measurable decrease in EGFR phosphorylation. This blockade is anticipated to result in the reduction of PLCγ activation and subsequent PKCα-mediated phosphorylation of tight junction proteins. Given the structural and signaling role of tight junction proteins like claudins, occludin, and zonula occludens (ZO-1), reducing their phosphorylation is expected to stabilize the tight junction complex, thereby preventing or mitigating the increase in intestinal permeability that is characteristically observed during gluten exposure in celiac disease (Tang et al., 2016; Samak et al., 2021).

This expectation is built on a substantial body of preclinical evidence where EGFR inhibitors have been used to block signaling cascades that compromise epithelial barrier function. For instance, studies in models employing the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 demonstrated decreased cellular invasiveness and reduced telomerase activity (Fang et al., 2008), suggesting that AG1478 significantly alters intracellular signaling in a manner that could be beneficial in the context of barrier preservation. Furthermore, detailed investigations in epithelial models have shown that EGFR signaling is directly involved in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and tight junction assembly. In this light, AG1478’s inhibition of EGFR should sustain tight junction integrity despite the presence of gliadin-derived zonulin release, which is implicated in the disruption of these intercellular junctions (Rao, 2012; Veres-Székely et al., 2023). It is also important to note that EGFR is well expressed in intestinal epithelial cells, including Caco-2 cells, which are routinely used as an in vitro model of the intestinal barrier. Therefore, a reduction in EGFR activity via AG1478 correlates with direct modulation of the barrier properties in these cells (Normanno et al., 2003; Shi et al., 2009).

On a molecular level, by preventing the phosphorylation of EGFR, AG1478 would keep the receptor in its inactive state, thereby blocking the cascade that leads to PLCγ activation. Without active PLCγ, the generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) is impeded, which in turn prevents the activation of PKCα—a central mediator of tight junction protein phosphorylation. The loss of PKCα activity would, therefore, hinder the abnormal modification of tight junction components and preserve the cytoskeletal integrity that underlies effective barrier function. This expected biochemical cascade is in line with earlier experimental findings where pharmacological inhibition of EGFR by agents similar to AG1478 resulted in the preservation of tight junction integrity and improved transepithelial resistance in epithelial monolayers (Wadhwani, 2013; Shi et al., 2009). Consequently, in the assay proposed by the research team, AG1478 is anticipated to maintain or restore the intestinal epithelial barrier in the presence of gliadin challenge, thus potentially mitigating one of the central pathophysiological events in celiac disease.

Overall Evaluation:
When evaluating AG1478 as a repurposed drug candidate for celiac disease, several strengths and weaknesses merit discussion. One of the most significant strengths is that AG1478 is a well-characterized, low molecular weight, ATP-competitive inhibitor of EGFR with demonstrated nanomolar potency. Its chemical structure—a quinazoline derivative—has been validated through extensive preclinical research, and its use has provided critical insights into EGFR signaling in various cellular contexts, primarily in cancer models (Ellis et al., 2006; Fang et al., 2008). This body of evidence gives a strong mechanistic foundation to hypothesize that AG1478 could interfere with EGFR transactivation induced by zonulin/PAR2 signaling during gluten exposure. The clear definition of its mechanism of action—competing with ATP at the receptor’s kinase domain to prevent autophosphorylation—makes the expected biochemical impact relatively predictable (Shi et al., 2009; Johns et al., 2003).

A further strength is its favorable pharmacological profile reported in preclinical studies. AG1478 has been widely used in various in vitro systems, including Caco-2 cell monolayers, where its capacity to modulate epithelial signaling pathways was documented. Its reversible inhibition of EGFR and its ability to achieve effective concentrations in experimental settings support translational feasibility, particularly when one considers the need to modulate signaling reversibly in the gut where both barrier maintenance and dynamic repair processes occur (Fang et al., 2008; Johns et al., 2003).

However, several weaknesses and potential challenges must be acknowledged. First, the literature review shows that while EGFR inhibition can block pathological signaling in cancer and other models, EGFR activation is also known to play a protective role in maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity under various physiological and stress conditions. For example, studies in models of colitis and intestinal injury demonstrate that EGFR signaling supports epithelial repair and barrier integrity, and inhibition of this pathway may actually predispose to barrier dysfunction and even exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea (Yu et al., 2019; Tao & Chityala, 2021). This duality raises a significant concern; if EGFR transactivation induced by zonulin is indeed driving barrier loss in the context of gluten exposure, then inhibiting this pathway may help. Conversely, if EGFR signaling in the intestine is concurrently responsible for epithelial restitution and mucosal healing, blanket inhibition could lead to unintended adverse effects. This inherent complexity in EGFR biology in the gut necessitates rigorous validation and careful titration of inhibitor dosage to avoid a scenario where the protective aspects of EGFR-mediated signaling are compromised (Rao, 2012; Tang et al., 2016).

Another potential limitation is the lack of any prior clinical or preclinical studies involving AG1478 in the specific context of celiac disease. A search of the clinical trials database confirms that no studies have been registered in which AG1478 or other EGFR inhibitors have been evaluated for celiac disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This absence implies that the translational path for repurposing AG1478 in celiac disease is largely uncharted territory, which, while offering the potential for innovative therapeutic strategies, also increases the developmental risk and uncertainty associated with this approach (Abourehab et al., 2021).

Furthermore, the hypothesis relies on the assumption that the EGFR transactivation induced by zonulin via PAR2 is solely detrimental to intestinal barrier integrity. Although there is experimental evidence suggesting that zonulin can disrupt tight junctions through EGFR-mediated pathways (Valitutti & Fasano, 2019), there are also conflicting reports indicating that EGFR activity can enhance tight junction protein expression and facilitate mucosal repair (Yu et al., 2019; Samak et al., 2021). This dichotomy must be reconciled with the therapeutic aim, and it underscores the possibility that the timing, tissue distribution, and local concentration of AG1478 will be critical determinants of its net effect in celiac disease. The balancing act between inhibiting pathological signaling and preserving essential physiological signaling is a major challenge for drug candidates targeting broadly expressed receptors like EGFR.

In addition, the gut microenvironment in celiac disease is highly complex and characterized by an interplay of immune activation, microbial dysbiosis, and epithelial stress responses. It is not entirely clear from the existing literature if EGFR inhibition with AG1478 would have a singularly beneficial impact on the intestinal barrier under gluten exposure or whether it might inadvertently dampen reparative processes. Although preclinical evidence shows some promise in using EGFR inhibitors to modulate inflammatory and proliferative signals in epithelial tissues (Johns et al., 2003; Shi et al., 2009), similar beneficial outcomes have not been robustly demonstrated in the setting of gluten-induced damage or celiac disease-like conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Finally, from the perspective of drug development, while AG1478 is a useful research tool with a well-understood mechanism, its safety profile, pharmacokinetics, and long-term effects in the context of a chronic, non-malignant condition such as celiac disease have not been established. In contrast to many anticancer drugs where transient EGFR inhibition is acceptable, chronic inhibition in celiac patients might lead to unforeseen gastrointestinal side effects, such as impaired epithelial repair, increased susceptibility to infections, or exacerbation of intestinal inflammation (Tao & Chityala, 2021; Veres-Székely et al., 2023).

Overall, while the underlying rationale—that AG1478 may inhibit aberrant EGFR transactivation driven by zonulin/PAR2 signaling and thus help maintain tight junction integrity in gluten-exposed intestinal epithelium—is scientifically plausible, the evidence remains largely circumstantial and drawn from cancer and general gastrointestinal research rather than from dedicated studies in celiac disease. The strengths of AG1478 lie in its well-characterized mechanism, potent inhibitory activity, and the extensive body of biochemical literature supporting its effects on EGFR signaling (Ellis et al., 2006; Fang et al., 2008). However, significant weaknesses include the contrasting roles of EGFR in barrier repair, the lack of direct experimental evidence in gluten-induced barrier disruption models, and the absence of clinical data supporting its application in celiac disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yu et al., 2019). Consequently, before committing resources to further development, it would be essential to conduct detailed in vitro and in vivo studies specifically designed to elucidate how EGFR inhibition by AG1478 impacts the intestinal barrier in the context of gluten challenge. Such studies should carefully assess not only the molecular endpoints (e.g., EGFR, PLC, and PKCα activity, tight junction phosphorylation) but also functional parameters including transepithelial resistance, cytokine release, and mucosal healing in models that recapitulate key aspects of celiac disease pathophysiology (Tang et al., 2016; Samak et al., 2021). Only with these data will it be possible to determine whether AG1478 presents a viable and safe strategy for repurposing as a therapeutic candidate in the treatment of celiac disease.

In summary, AG1478 has a strong mechanistic rationale as an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and its well-documented effects in modulating EGFR-related signaling pathways offer an attractive hypothesis for mitigating zonulin-induced barrier disruption during gluten exposure. Nonetheless, the dual nature of EGFR signaling in the gut and the absence of direct evidence in celiac disease models represent significant challenges. The candidate’s preclinical promise must be balanced against the risk that inhibition of a receptor crucial for epithelial repair may lead to unintended adverse outcomes in the chronic inflammatory setting of celiac disease. Future work should focus on detailed mechanistic studies and the development of models that accurately mimic the gluten-induced epithelial barrier loss seen in celiac disease to further validate the viability of AG1478 in this novel therapeutic area (Shi et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2019).

LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor),"Proposal for LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
LY294002 is a synthetic small molecule that was originally developed as a quercetin analogue and is widely recognized as a potent, reversible inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) enzymes (Baiz et al., 2012). It belongs to the drug class of PI3K inhibitors, compounds designed to target the ATP-binding pocket of PI3K and thereby disrupt the generation of the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which is essential for activation of downstream effectors such as Akt (Dittmann et al., 2014). LY294002 was synthetically derived using classical medicinal chemistry approaches, where modifications of natural flavonoid scaffolds were employed to generate a more potent and selective molecule compared to the parent molecule quercetin (Baiz et al., 2012; Gharbi et al., 2007). As a member of PI3K inhibitors, this compound has been widely used in basic research to dissect the signal transduction mechanisms dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway and as a chemical probe in numerous cellular systems (Walker et al., 2000). The broad application of this drug class in cancer research, immunology, and studies of cellular metabolism further underscores its established role as a molecular tool even though its clinical translation has been limited due to issues including off-target effects and suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties (Foster et al., 2012).

Therapeutic History:
The historical development and application of LY294002 have been predominantly in the context of basic biomedical research rather than clinical therapy. Extensive biochemical studies have employed LY294002 as a tool to elucidate aspects of the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade, notably in cancer biology, where aberrant activation of this pathway contributes to cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis (Foster et al., 2012; Mallawaaratchy et al., 2012). In vitro studies across diverse cellular models, including cancer cell lines, have demonstrated its capacity to inhibit Akt phosphorylation and downstream signaling events, thereby impacting processes such as cell growth, apoptosis, and metabolism (Walker et al., 2000; Gharbi et al., 2007). To date, the utilization of LY294002 has been largely confined to research settings; there is no well-documented clinical application in celiac disease or any gastrointestinal pathology where barrier function is a primary concern (Imai et al., 2012). Although diverse therapeutic candidates in the PI3K inhibitor class have been explored in oncology—with some dual inhibitors progressing into clinical trials—there is no published evidence that LY294002 itself has been directly evaluated for correcting tight junction disruption in celiac disease models or similar intestinal inflammatory conditions (Garlich et al., 2008).

Mechanism of Action:
The known mechanism of action of LY294002 is through competitive inhibition of PI3K by binding to the ATP-binding site within the enzyme’s catalytic domain (Walker et al., 2000; Gharbi et al., 2007). By occupying the ATP-binding pocket, LY294002 prevents the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), a critical step that normally leads to recruitment and phosphorylation of the protein kinase Akt (Foster et al., 2012; Mallawaaratchy et al., 2012). Inhibition of PI3K effectively reduces PIP3 levels, thereby suppressing the activation of Akt and the subsequent phosphorylation of downstream targets involved in cell survival, metabolism, and proliferation (Walker et al., 2000). Structural studies have identified key interactions such as hydrogen bonding between LY294002 and residues in the PI3K catalytic pocket, providing a molecular rationale for its inhibitory activity (Gharbi et al., 2007). Importantly, the PI3K/Akt pathway has been implicated in the regulation of tight junction (TJ) assembly and stability, with Akt phosphorylation influencing the dynamic localization of crucial TJ proteins like ZO-1 (Zhao et al., 2017). Under gliadin challenge—a condition known to disrupt tight junction integrity in celiac disease—the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway may contribute to mislocalization of ZO-1 and increased paracellular permeability (Yap et al., 2015). Therefore, by inhibiting PI3K, LY294002 is expected to attenuate Akt phosphorylation, thereby promoting the maintenance or reassembly of ZO-1 at the cell membrane, ultimately reinforcing the barrier function of intestinal epithelial cells (Imai et al., 2012; Falasca, 2010).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed therapeutic hypothesis, LY294002 is expected to attenuate the gliadin-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade. Under normal circumstances, gliadin peptides may trigger intracellular signaling events that lead to disassembly or mislocalization of tight junction proteins, such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), thereby increasing paracellular permeability and compromising barrier integrity—a hallmark of celiac disease (Unknown Reference). The administration of LY294002 should, in theory, reduce the phosphorylation of Akt by effectively interfering with PI3K activity, and this decrease in Akt activation would mitigate the downstream effects that lead to disruption of TJ protein complexes (Mallawaaratchy et al., 2012; Walker et al., 2000). In cellular assays utilizing either gut organoid models or cultured epithelial cell lines known to express tight junction proteins and components of the PI3K/Akt pathway, the expected outcome is an observable stabilization of ZO-1 at the cell membrane even in the presence of gliadin peptides (Imai et al., 2012). Several studies demonstrate that epithelial cells challenged with inflammatory stimuli exhibit rapid changes in TJ composition and localization, which can be at least partially rescued by PI3K inhibition (Foster et al., 2012). Additionally, since PI3K inhibitors have been extensively used in research to probe barrier regulation in various cell types, the application of LY294002 should lead to reduced paracellular permeability, thus reinforcing barrier integrity (Garcia-Echeverria & Sellers, 2008). The selective reduction in Akt phosphorylation is critical because Akt activity is associated with downstream targets that modulate the cytoskeletal rearrangements and protein complex dynamics essential for tight junction maintenance (Mallawaaratchy et al., 2012). Moreover, the fact that LY294002 has been characterized by reversible binding and a relatively well-defined in vitro profile supports its suitability for proof-of-concept studies in both organoid systems and animal models of celiac disease, where barrier dysfunction is a central pathophysiological feature (Welker & Kulik, 2013).

Overall Evaluation:
The proposal of repurposing LY294002 for celiac disease, based on its ability to inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway and thereby preserve tight junction integrity under gliadin-induced stress, is scientifically intriguing but comes with both strengths and notable weaknesses. One strength is the compound’s well-established mechanism of action—LY294002 has been extensively validated as a PI3K inhibitor with direct impacts on Akt phosphorylation, a process that is critical in the regulation of tight junction assembly and cell survival (Walker et al., 2000; Gharbi et al., 2007). This mechanistic underpinning is particularly relevant in the context of celiac disease, where gliadin peptides perturb epithelial barrier functions, and interventions that restore ZO-1 localization could theoretically ameliorate barrier dysfunction (Unknown Reference). Another strength lies in the compound’s supportive in vitro data from cancer and other cellular models, where LY294002 has been shown to reduce paracellular permeability and modulate signaling pathways linked to cell proliferation and survival (Dittmann et al., 2014; Foster et al., 2012). Furthermore, the reversible nature of LY294002’s inhibition and its extensive use as a biochemical probe provide a solid foundation for controlled preclinical experiments in organoid cultures and mouse models designed to replicate aspects of celiac pathology (Welker & Kulik, 2013).

However, significant weaknesses temper the enthusiasm for repurposing LY294002 for celiac disease therapy. First, while the compound is a robust tool in vitro, its pharmacokinetic limitations—including poor solubility, rapid metabolism, and potential off-target effects—have long been recognized as barriers to clinical translation (Baiz et al., 2012; Gharbi et al., 2007). These pharmacokinetic drawbacks raise concerns about its effectiveness and safety profile in vivo, especially in the gastrointestinal milieu where complex absorption, metabolism, and local tissue interactions occur. Second, the historical use of LY294002 is almost exclusively confined to experimental settings in cancer biology and signal transduction research, with little to no evidence of its application in celiac disease or other inflammatory, barrier-related pathologies (Imai et al., 2012; Yaguchi et al., 2006). This gap in clinical precedent means that substantial preclinical work would be necessary to validate its efficacy in restoring tight junction integrity under conditions specific to gliadin exposure. Third, off-target effects have been repeatedly noted in the literature; LY294002 can inhibit enzymes other than PI3K, including CK2 and other kinases, which could potentially confound the interpretation of results in complex disease states such as celiac disease, where multiple signaling pathways are deregulated (Gharbi et al., 2007; Jacobs et al., 2005). These non-PI3K interactions might limit its utility or prompt unintended adverse effects in vivo if not carefully controlled within a proof-of-concept framework. Finally, in the context of celiac disease, restoration of tight junction stability is just one aspect of a multi-faceted pathogenesis that involves adaptive immunity against gluten peptides, inflammatory cytokine production, and genetic susceptibility; therefore, a monotherapy approach with LY294002 may be insufficient unless combined with other therapeutic strategies that address the broader disease mechanism (Yap et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2017).

Considering these aspects, our overall evaluation is that LY294002 has sufficient scientific rationale as a molecular tool to explore the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in gliadin-induced tight junction disruption. Its ability to inhibit PI3K and thereby reduce Akt phosphorylation is well-established and correlates with an expected protective effect on ZO-1 membrane residency and barrier function (Walker et al., 2000; Mallawaaratchy et al., 2012; Gharbi et al., 2007; Foster et al., 2012). However, the transition from an experimental probe to a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease faces major hurdles, including suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties, potential off-target activity, and a lack of prior evidence in gastrointestinal or inflammatory disease settings (Foster et al., 2012; Yaguchi et al., 2006). To move forward, rigorous preclinical studies are needed to assess the impact of LY294002 on intestinal epithelial barrier integrity in both cell-based and animal models of celiac disease, and to evaluate the safety margin of this compound in a context distinct from oncological applications (Unknown Reference). Additionally, structural optimization or formulation strategies might be required to overcome its inherent pharmacological limitations if it is to be considered as a viable candidate for repurposing. In summary, while LY294002 offers an attractive mechanistic hypothesis for reinforcing epithelial barrier integrity by modulating PI3K/Akt signaling, its historical drawbacks in drug-like properties and the absence of gastrointestinal validation suggest that it may be more suitable as a proof-of-concept agent rather than a final therapeutic solution for celiac disease (Baiz et al., 2012).

Diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI),"Proposal for Diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) is a synthetic iodonium compound originally discovered and characterized for its potent inhibitory action on flavoprotein-dependent enzymes, most notably the NADPH oxidase (NOX) family. DPI belongs to a class of compounds often referred to as flavoprotein inhibitors, which function by interacting with reduced flavin cofactors (such as FAD and FMN) present within the active sites of these enzymes. In its early biochemical studies, DPI was synthesized as a sulfate salt and used extensively to study enzyme activities in neutrophils, particularly due to its ability to form covalent adducts with the flavin moieties via a radical-mediated mechanism. Its discovery came during investigations into the electron transfer processes of oxidases and other redox-active enzymes, where its ability to abstract electrons from reduced flavins and subsequently form stable phenyl radical adducts was elucidated (O'Donnell et al., 1993). In terms of chemical classification, DPI is recognized as a member of the iodonium salt family. These compounds are primarily synthetic in origin and are designed to perturb redox processes, functioning as irreversible inhibitors of multiple flavoproteins. Historically, compounds of this class have predominantly been used as research tools rather than clinical drugs, providing valuable insights into oxidative mechanisms, enzyme kinetics, and redox regulation (O'Donnell et al., 1993; Altenhöfer et al., 2015).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of DPI is largely rooted in its role as a biochemical inhibitor in experimental settings. DPI has been employed in a wide range of in vitro studies for the investigation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and NOX enzyme function in various cell types, including neutrophils, endothelial cells, and intestinal epithelial cells. Over the years, DPI has served as a key tool compound in dissecting the pathways of oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling, and its efficacy in reducing the electron transport essential for superoxide generation has been well documented (O'Donnell et al., 1993; Riganti et al., 2004). Notably, while DPI has demonstrated broad-spectrum inhibition of NADPH oxidases as well as other flavoproteins (such as NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase and nitric oxide synthase) in biochemical assays, its use to date has been almost exclusively confined to preclinical research rather than clinical applications. Clinical trial searches for DPI in the context of celiac disease or other inflammatory gut conditions have yielded no evidence of registered studies, underscoring that DPI – like many other iodonium compounds – has not been previously developed or approved as a therapeutic agent for any human or veterinary condition (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Its established role has been as a research tool to validate the contribution of NOX-derived ROS in disease models rather than as a repurposed drug candidate in patients.

Mechanism of Action:
The molecular mechanism of DPI centers on its ability to inhibit flavoprotein-containing enzymes through a covalent and irreversible binding process. DPI’s mode of action involves electron abstraction from reduced flavin cofactors, predominantly FAD and FMN, which are critical for the enzymatic activity of the NADPH oxidase complexes. Upon accepting electrons from these reduced flavins, DPI forms phenyl radicals that subsequently engage in covalent adduct formation with the flavin moiety and potentially with adjacent amino acid residues. This radical-mediated process effectively disrupts electron transport through the enzyme complex, thereby halting the generation of superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (O'Donnell et al., 1993). DPI’s inhibitory effect is not limited to NOX enzymes; it similarly affects other NADPH- or NADH-dependent oxidoreductases, resulting in off-target inhibition that includes enzymes such as xanthine oxidase, cytochrome P450 reductase, and even enzymes involved in mitochondrial respiration (Riganti et al., 2004; Altenhöfer et al., 2015). In the context of intestinal epithelial cells, NOX enzymes—particularly NOX1—serve as major sources of low-level ROS which play roles in cell signaling and regulation of inflammatory responses. DPI, by blocking the electron transfer required for NOX1 activation, reduces ROS production, thereby interfering with ROS-dependent signaling cascades. Notably, studies have shown that DPI can reduce the expression of downstream inflammatory mediators such as IκB-ζ and lipocalin-2 (LCN-2) in colonic epithelial cells by suppressing NOX1-derived ROS, without significantly altering the phosphorylation state of canonical NF-κB subunits (Liu, 2021). This selective action on ROS-mediated pathways suggests that DPI may attenuate the activation of pro-inflammatory signaling cascades that are otherwise perpetuated by oxidative stress in the intestinal epithelium.

Expected Effect:
In the proposed hypothesis for treating celiac disease, DPI is expected to inhibit NOX complexes in enterocytes, thereby reducing both gliadin- and cytokine-induced ROS production. The anticipated outcome is a decrease in oxidative damage that normally contributes to the disassembly of tight junction (TJ) complexes in the intestinal epithelium. Specifically, gliadin peptides derived from gluten exposure have been demonstrated to induce oxidative stress, which activates signaling pathways such as NF-κB and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). These signaling processes contribute to the disruption of tight junction proteins like occludin and ZO-1, leading to compromised barrier integrity—a hallmark of celiac disease (Ferretti et al., 2012; Calabriso et al., 2022). By inhibiting NOX-mediated ROS production, DPI is hypothesized to reduce the activation of these pro-inflammatory pathways and protect the localization and integrity of tight junction proteins. In epithelial cell assays, particularly those using models such as differentiated CaCo-2 cells, DPI should diminish the ROS burst following gliadin exposure, thereby blunting downstream activation of MLCK and NF-κB signaling, both of which are known to influence TJ disassembly (Deiana et al., 2017). Additionally, since NOX1 is highly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and is modulated by cytokines such as TNFα and IL-17, DPI’s inhibitory effects could lead to a reduction in inflammatory cytokine production and a preservation of the epithelial barrier’s function (Liu, 2021; Calabriso et al., 2022). Essentially, the expected effects in the proposed assay are a reduction in ROS levels that prevents oxidative stress-induced remodeling of the cytoskeleton, decreased activation of MLCK (which normally leads to increased tight junction permeability), and a resultant maintenance of occludin and ZO-1 localization at the cell membrane.

Overall Evaluation:
Diphenyleneiodonium chloride presents as a promising research tool for validating the role of NOX-derived ROS in the pathogenesis of celiac disease, particularly concerning epithelial barrier dysfunction. Its rapid and potent inhibitory action on NOX complexes makes it an excellent candidate for dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying gliadin- and cytokine-mediated oxidative stress in enterocytes (O'Donnell et al., 1993; Liu, 2021). The strength of DPI lies in its well-characterized mechanism of forming covalent adducts with flavin cofactors, which leads to effective and irreversible inhibition of ROS-generating enzymes. This has been consistently demonstrated in biochemical studies and cell culture models across various research contexts. The expected therapeutic benefit in celiac disease would be the protection of the intestinal barrier through the preservation of tight junction integrity, achieved by dampening both ROS production and the subsequent activation of signaling pathways—specifically NF-κB and MLCK—that contribute to tight junction disassembly (Calabriso et al., 2022; Deiana et al., 2017).

However, several significant weaknesses also exist with DPI as a therapeutic candidate. First and foremost, DPI is inherently non-selective, as it inhibits a broad spectrum of flavoprotein-dependent enzymes. This promiscuity leads to off-target effects that could disrupt essential cellular metabolic processes beyond the intended inhibition of NOX enzymes. For instance, DPI has been shown to inhibit mitochondrial respiratory enzymes and other NADPH/NADH oxidoreductases such as xanthine oxidase and cytochrome P450 reductase (Riganti et al., 2004; Altenhöfer et al., 2015). Such off-target actions may result in deleterious cellular effects, including mitochondrial dysfunction or impaired redox homeostasis, which could offset the benefits of reduced oxidative stress in the intestinal epithelium. Moreover, despite its robust inhibitory capacity in vitro, DPI’s toxicity profile at higher doses has historically limited its clinical translation. Its narrow therapeutic window necessitates careful dosing, as high concentrations can lead to excessive suppression of cellular metabolism and even paradoxical induction of oxidative stress via inhibition of protective antioxidant systems (Riganti et al., 2004).

Another concern is that while DPI effectively reduces ROS production in acute experimental models, its lack of isoform selectivity could be problematic in a clinical context. In the gut, several NOX isoforms exist with distinct functions: for example, NOX1 is prevalent in enterocytes and associated with low-level ROS necessary for normal signaling and host defense, whereas NOX2 in immune cells contributes to microbial killing. Broad inhibition of all these forms could potentially impair normal redox signaling and immune responses, possibly increasing vulnerability to infections or altering gut homeostasis (Altenhöfer et al., 2015; Joshi et al., 2013). There is also no clinical or veterinary precedent for utilizing DPI—or its drug class—for treatment of celiac disease or similar intestinal disorders, a fact confirmed by the absence of any registered clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This lack of clinical data means that its safety and efficacy in a complex in vivo system remain unproven.

Furthermore, while the hypothesis that DPI will reduce MLCK and NF-κB activation through reduced ROS production is supported by its biochemical mechanism (Liu, 2021), the downstream effects on tight junction preservation have been largely tested in vitro. Translating these findings to a clinical setting, where multiple compensatory pathways and heterogeneity among patients exist, could prove challenging. Although the inhibitory effects observed in enterocyte models such as CaCo-2 cells are promising (Deiana et al., 2017; Calabriso et al., 2022), in vivo conditions in celiac disease are far more complex. Prolonged exposure to gluten peptides, genetic predispositions, and the interplay of immune cells all contribute to epithelial dysfunction, which may not be fully addressed by a broad NOX inhibitor.

In summary, DPI exhibits considerable potential as a mechanistic probe to validate NOX-derived ROS as a critical therapeutic target in celiac disease. Its capacity to rapidly block electron transfer in NADPH oxidases and decrease subsequent ROS generation supports the hypothesis that it might prevent gliadin-induced epithelial damage and tight junction disassembly. This is particularly relevant given the well-documented role of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory signaling (via NF-κB and MLCK) in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (Ferretti et al., 2012; Calabriso et al., 2022). However, its broad inhibitory activity, potential off-target toxicity, and the absence of clinical data specific to celiac disease represent significant hurdles that must be addressed. As such, DPI may be more suitably positioned as an experimental tool to validate the involvement of ROS in celiac barrier dysfunction rather than as a direct therapeutic candidate in its current form. Future efforts might focus on developing more selective NOX inhibitors that retain the beneficial effects observed with DPI but with improved specificity and safety profiles for clinical application in celiac disease therapy (O'Donnell et al., 1993; Riganti et al., 2004).

Overall, while DPI’s mechanism of action provides compelling evidence for its potential to mitigate oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling in intestinal epithelial cells, the challenges associated with its non-specificity and toxicity necessitate careful consideration before advancing it into clinical trials for celiac disease. Its utility as a proof-of-concept tool is clear; however, for therapeutic development, refinements in specificity or modifications that reduce off-target effects would be critical to achieve a favorable safety and efficacy profile for patients suffering from celiac disease.
