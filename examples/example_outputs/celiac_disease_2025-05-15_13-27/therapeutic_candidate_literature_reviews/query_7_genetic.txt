Query: Genetic and functional evidence linking specific tight junction proteins (e.g., claudin-2, occludin, ZO-1) and their regulators to celiac disease susceptibility or severity, including GWAS, knockout, or overexpression studies in disease models

Genetic and functional evidence indicates that deregulation of tight junction (TJ) proteins and their regulatory partners is associated with celiac disease (CeD) susceptibility and severity. Although genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) in CeD have largely highlighted non‐HLA risk variants—mainly in noncoding regions that influence immune responses—the functional consequences suggest that disrupted regulation of the epithelial barrier plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. For instance, analyses of CeD patient biopsies reveal significant alterations in the expression and localization of key TJ proteins. Specifically, claudin-2 is consistently upregulated, while barrier-forming components such as occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) are mislocalized at the cell membrane, even when total protein levels might not be altered. These changes in TJ composition correlate with reduced transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increased paracellular permeability, underlying the mucosal dysfunction observed in CeD (CardosoSilva2019intestinalbarrierfunction pages 7-9, Schumann2017celiacdiseaserole pages 16-18).

Functional studies employing in vitro models support a role for TJ regulators in barrier integrity. For example, CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of putative TJ regulators LPP (lipoma preferred partner) and C1orf106 in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cell lines results in altered TJ protein levels and impaired barrier function. In these models, C1orf106 knockout clones show a consistent decrease in TEER, while LPP knockout clones exhibit increased levels of certain claudins (e.g., claudin-3) and trends toward altered barrier re-establishment. Although these experiments do not target claudin-2, occludin, or ZO-1 directly, they demonstrate that genetic disruption of barrier-regulating proteins has functional consequences on TJ composition and overall epithelial integrity, suggesting that similar dysregulations in patients could contribute to disease severity (Silva2021geneexpressionanalysis pages 73-78).

The influence of inflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-α and IFN-γ, further supports a functional link between TJ modifications and CeD. Cytokine exposure in epithelial cell models leads to displacement of occludin and ZO-1 from the cell membrane and enhanced expression of pore-forming proteins such as claudin-2. These cytokine-induced changes not only compromise barrier function but also facilitate the translocation of immunogenic gliadin peptides across the intestinal epithelium—an early and critical event in CeD pathogenesis (CardosoSilva2019intestinalbarrierfunction pages 16-17, Schulzke2015claudin2asa pages 4-5).

While direct knockout or overexpression models for claudin-2, occludin, or ZO-1 within a CeD-specific context remain limited, the cumulative functional data indicate that TJ protein deregulation is a major contributing factor. GWAS have yet to conclusively link variants in the genes encoding these TJ proteins to CeD; instead, the genetic risk appears to involve regulators that control epithelial barrier assembly and function, such as LPP and C1orf106. These regulators modulate the expression, localization, and post-translational modifications of TJ proteins, thereby affecting barrier integrity (Silva2021geneexpressionanalysis pages 39-43, Schumann2017celiacdiseaserole pages 18-19).

In summary, although there is a gap in direct genetic evidence from GWAS linking claudin-2, occludin, or ZO-1 specifically to CeD, the combination of patient biopsy analyses and functional in vitro studies using knockout models for barrier regulators provides strong support for the concept that alterations in TJ protein complexes and their regulatory networks contribute to CeD susceptibility and severity (CardosoSilva2019intestinalbarrierfunction pages 7-9, Silva2021geneexpressionanalysis pages 73-78).
