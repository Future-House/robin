Query: Efficacy of candidate therapies in disease-relevant in vitro and in vivo celiac disease models, such as patient-derived intestinal organoids or HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice, measuring reversal of gliadin-induced barrier disruption and downstream inflammatory markers

Candidate therapies for celiac disease have been evaluated in several disease‐relevant in vitro and in vivo models that specifically address gliadin-induced barrier disruption and the associated inflammatory response, even though there are currently no registered clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov that meet these precise criteria (Clinical Trials Search: celiac disease AND (organoids OR HLA-DQ8 mice OR animal model) AND (gliadin-induced barrier dysfunction OR inflammatory markers)). In vitro systems such as patient-derived intestinal organoids and epithelial cell cultures (e.g., Caco-2 cells) have been instrumental in modeling gliadin-induced tight junction (TJ) perturbation; these models demonstrate that gliadin exposure leads to disruption of TJ proteins (e.g., reduction of ZO-1 and alterations in CLDN2 or TJP1 expression), increased epithelial permeability, and consequent upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 2-3).

Several candidate therapies have shown promise in reversing these pathological changes. For example, probiotic strains—including Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 9595, and Bifidobacterium lactis—have demonstrated efficacy in both in vitro epithelial cell models and in vivo gluten-sensitized mouse models by preserving barrier function, restoring TJ protein localization, and reducing inflammatory markers such as IL-6 and TNF-α (buiten2017physicochemicalmodificationof pages 61-66). These studies not only noted improvement in barrier integrity but also a reduction in inflammatory cascades that are critical to the pathogenesis of celiac disease.

The zonulin antagonist larazotide acetate has been similarly evaluated. In vitro assays reveal that larazotide acetate can prevent gliadin-induced TJ disruption in Caco-2 monolayers, effectively maintaining barrier integrity and limiting the paracellular transport of immunogenic gliadin peptides (buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12). In vivo, in HLA-DQ8 transgenic mouse models, larazotide acetate has been shown to protect against intestinal epithelial cell destruction and reduce the influx of intraepithelial lymphocytes, thereby mitigating both structural and functional alterations associated with gliadin-induced damage (buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12).

Gluten sequestration strategies have further expanded therapeutic options. Synthetic polymers such as BL-7010, which specifically bind to α-gliadin peptides, have been tested in HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice, where they not only inhibited the enzymatic hydrolysis of gliadin into immunogenic fragments but also maintained TJ protein ZO-1 localization and reduced local inflammatory markers (crepaldi2023emergingpharmaceuticaltherapies pages 10-11). Similarly, enzyme-based therapies using compounds like Aspergillus niger prolyl endopeptidase (AN-PEP) or ALV003 have been evaluated in clinical challenges, with preclinical data indicating they can diminish histopathological alterations by degrading gliadin peptides before they elicit an immune response (buiten2017physicochemicalmodificationof pages 197-202).

Beyond these direct barrier-targeted therapies, modulation of immune pathways has also been explored. TG2 inhibitors, for instance, block the deamidation of gliadin—a process essential for T-cell activation—and have been shown to prevent gliadin-induced T-cell proliferation in ex vivo organ cultures from patient small bowel mucosa as well as to reduce epithelial permeability in vitro (kivela2021currentandemerging pages 22-26). In addition, emerging studies indicate that dietary polyphenols such as EGCG from green tea can form insoluble complexes with immunogenic gliadin peptides, subsequently reducing their ability to disrupt barrier function and evoke proinflammatory responses; although these findings are predominantly in vitro, they underscore the potential for nutraceutical strategies to complement other therapies (dias2020fromchemistryto pages 111-116).

Together, these data from patient-derived organoids, transgenic models, and in vitro systems provide compelling evidence that candidate therapies—ranging from probiotics and zonulin antagonists to gluten sequestration polymers and TG2 inhibitors—are efficacious in reversing gliadin-induced barrier disruption and reducing downstream inflammatory markers. Nevertheless, while preclinical findings are promising, further studies are required to translate these mechanistic insights into consistently effective clinical therapies (buiten2017physicochemicalmodificationof pages 57-61).
