Query: Biomarkers of intestinal barrier dysfunction in celiac disease, including serum zonulin, fecal calprotectin, tight junction protein fragments, and transcriptomic or proteomic signatures from intestinal biopsies correlating with in vivo permeability changes and clinical severity

Biomarkers of intestinal barrier dysfunction in celiac disease have been investigated to provide non‐invasive means of assessing epithelial integrity, correlating functional permeability changes with clinical severity. Among these, serum zonulin is the most widely studied. Zonulin, a protein that modulates tight junction disassembly, is elevated in celiac disease patients and has been correlated with increased intestinal permeability as measured by lactulose/mannitol urine tests in several clinical trials. However, there is considerable debate regarding its specificity and the reliability of available assays, with some evidence suggesting that current commercial ELISA kits may not accurately measure true zonulin levels, thereby complicating its clinical application (mogilevski2022biomarkersofintestinal pages 41-45, fasano2020alldiseasebegins pages 7-8).

Fecal calprotectin, another biomarker frequently assessed in intestinal disorders, serves primarily as a marker of mucosal inflammation. In celiac disease, although elevated fecal calprotectin levels have been documented and are thought to reflect underlying inflammatory processes secondary to barrier dysfunction, its specificity for celiac-related permeability changes is limited compared to its established role in inflammatory bowel disease. Its correlation with direct measures of permeability and clinical severity in celiac patients remains less clearly defined, suggesting that while it provides valuable information regarding inflammatory activity, it may not fully capture barrier integrity on its own (mogilevski2022biomarkersofintestinal pages 100-105, ramirezsanchez2020molecularbiomarkersfor pages 14-16).

Examining tight junction protein fragments offers a more direct approach to assessing the structural integrity of the epithelial barrier. Fragments of proteins such as claudin-3, occludin, and syndecan-1 have been postulated to be released during epithelial disruption, with their circulating levels potentially reflecting tight junction breakage. However, technical limitations, including the variable expression of these proteins in other tissues and their modulation by general inflammatory processes, diminish their specificity as biomarkers solely for intestinal barrier dysfunction. Despite these concerns, studies indicate that their detection could complement functional permeability tests, particularly when used alongside other markers (mogilevski2022biomarkersofintestinal pages 53-57, mogilevski2022biomarkersofintestinal pages 41-45).

Transcriptomic and proteomic signatures derived from intestinal biopsies hold promise for identifying molecular patterns reflective of barrier disruption and mucosal damage. High-throughput gene expression profiling has revealed specific signatures that correlate with histological features such as villous atrophy and altered tight junction structure in celiac disease. These molecular profiles may provide a detailed picture of the underlying pathophysiology, linking in vivo permeability measurements (like sugar absorption tests) with clinical severity. However, these approaches remain mainly within the research domain, as technical challenges and observer variability in histological interpretation currently limit their routine clinical application (ramirezsanchez2020molecularbiomarkersfor pages 22-24, ramirezsanchez2020molecularbiomarkersfor pages 14-16).

Clinical trials such as NCT01574209, NCT04351828, NCT03483805, and NCT06300164 have predominantly focused on serum zonulin and functional tests to assess permeability changes following dietary interventions or probiotic treatments. These studies underscore that while serum zonulin is a surrogate indicator of barrier integrity that may correlate with clinical symptomatology (notably in relation to gluten exposure and dietary adherence), a composite biomarker strategy—including inflammatory markers, structural proteins, and molecular signatures—is likely necessary to fully characterize the complex relationship between intestinal permeability and disease severity in celiac disease (Clinical Trials Search: celiac disease AND (zonulin OR calprotectin OR tight junction OR proteomic OR transcriptomic OR intestinal permeability), NCT01574209).
