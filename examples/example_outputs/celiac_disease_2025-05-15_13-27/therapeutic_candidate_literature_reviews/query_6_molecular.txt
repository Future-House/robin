Query: Molecular mechanisms underlying gluten-induced intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction in celiac disease, focusing on the role of zonulin signaling, tight junction protein modulation, and epithelial cytoskeleton rearrangement in early disease pathogenesis

Gluten-induced dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier in celiac disease is primarily driven by gliadin peptides triggering the release of zonulin, a key regulatory molecule known as prehaptoglobin-2 that modulates tight junction permeability (NCT01574209). Upon exposure to gluten, gliadin binds to the CXCR3 receptor on the apical surface of enterocytes, initiating a signaling cascade that results in rapid zonulin secretion (patt2023unravelingtheimmunopathological pages 2-4). This acute release of zonulin is a pivotal early event that primes the epithelial barrier for subsequent structural modifications through its impact on tight junction proteins and the actin cytoskeleton (cukrowska2017intestinalepitheliumintraepithelial pages 10-11).

Once secreted, zonulin exerts its biological effects by engaging receptors that transactivate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), leading to the activation of downstream effectors such as protein kinase C (PKC) (cukrowska2017intestinalepitheliumintraepithelial pages 3-5). PKC activation, in turn, results in phosphorylation and redistribution of tight junction proteins including tight junction protein 1 (TJP1 or ZO-1) and occludin; these proteins are essential for maintaining the integrity of the paracellular barrier between adjacent epithelial cells (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 12-13). The altered phosphorylation status of these proteins leads to the reversible disassembly of tight junction strands, which is manifested as increased paracellular permeability—a critical early pathogenic feature of celiac disease (musaico2020studyofbiochemical pages 32-35).

Concomitantly, zonulin signaling induces significant cytoskeletal rearrangement within enterocytes. The actin cytoskeleton, which is tightly coupled to junctional complexes via scaffold proteins, undergoes reorganization as a result of PKC-mediated signaling events. This cytoskeletal remodeling further destabilizes tight junction complexes by disrupting the anchorage of proteins like ZO-1 and occludin, thereby amplifying the leakage between epithelial cells (ajamian2019investigatingmarkersof pages 33-37). This cascade of events creates a permissive environment for the translocation of immunogenic gluten peptides into the lamina propria, where they can be deamidated by tissue transglutaminase and presented to gluten-specific T cells, ultimately driving the adaptive immune response characteristic of celiac pathology (NCT02061306).

The resulting immune activation is both a consequence and an amplifier of barrier dysfunction, as pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-15) released in response to gliadin peptides further perturb tight junction integrity and sustain the epithelial leakiness (musaico2020studyofbiochemical pages 32-35, patt2023unravelingtheimmunopathological pages 2-4). This bidirectional interplay between zonulin-driven mechanism and immune-mediated injury is evidenced by clinical trials exploring agents such as larazotide acetate, which aim to inhibit zonulin signaling to restore tight junction integrity and reduce intestinal permeability during gluten exposure (NCT00362856, NCT00386165).

Collectively, these molecular insights outline a sequential mechanism in which gluten ingestion rapidly induces zonulin release, leading to tight junction protein modulation through phosphorylation events and resulting in actin cytoskeleton reorganization. This sequence establishes increased intestinal permeability that not only precedes but also facilitates the subsequent inflammatory and autoimmune responses observed in early celiac disease pathogenesis (cukrowska2017intestinalepitheliumintraepithelial pages 10-11, freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 12-13, Clinical Trials Search: celiac disease AND gluten AND (zonulin OR tight junction OR cytoskeleton)).
