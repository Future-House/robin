Query: Emerging novel molecular targets implicated in celiac disease beyond traditional HLA-DQ2/8-mediated T-cell responses, including epithelial stress sensors, autophagy pathways, endoplasmic reticulum stress modulators, and microbiome-derived metabolites affecting intestinal barrier function and immune activation

Emerging novel molecular targets in celiac disease pathogenesis extend well beyond the classical HLA-DQ2/8‐mediated adaptive immune responses. Instead, recent research highlights roles for epithelial stress sensors, autophagy pathways, ER stress modulators, and microbiome-derived metabolites that collectively influence intestinal barrier integrity and immune activation.

First, epithelial stress sensors are activated by gluten peptides, especially those resistant to degradation like the gliadin 33‐mer. These peptides interact with receptors such as CXCR3 on intestinal epithelial cells, triggering a cascade that culminates in zonulin release. Zonulin, a key regulator of tight junction dynamics, mediates the disassembly of intercellular junctions, thereby increasing intestinal permeability and facilitating the translocation of immunogenic peptides into the lamina propria. This breach not only exposes the subepithelial immune system to gluten antigens but also initiates injury signals that may exacerbate local inflammation (ferrari2021characterizationofmouse pages 14-18, monzani2022roleofer pages 1-6).

Second, dysregulation in autophagy pathways is emerging as a critical contributor to celiac disease pathology. Autophagy, the process of degrading and recycling damaged cellular components, is essential for maintaining epithelial cell homeostasis. In the context of gliadin exposure, impaired autophagy may result in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, enhancing cellular stress. This dysfunction can indirectly influence antigen presentation and cytokine production. The disruption of autophagic flux, therefore, contributes to both epithelial injury and aberrant immune activation (ferrari2021characterizationofmouse pages 70-74, monzani2022roleofer pages 1-6).

Third, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response has been prominently implicated in celiac disease. Gliadin-induced ER stress triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), marked by upregulation of critical regulators such as ATF4, ATF6, XBP1, and CHOP. While the UPR initially aims to restore ER homeostasis by promoting protein folding and degradation of misfolded proteins, chronic ER stress may lead to epithelial apoptosis and enhanced inflammatory signaling. This maladaptive response promotes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and further compromises tight junction integrity—a cascade that perpetuates intestinal barrier dysfunction (ferrari2021characterizationofmouse pages 53-60, monzani2022roleofer pages 6-11).

In tandem with these cellular stress pathways, the gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as a crucial modulator of intestinal barrier function and immune responses. Dysbiosis—defined as disturbances in the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota—can adversely affect epithelial integrity. Microbiome-derived metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, serve as signaling molecules that influence tight junction protein expression, modulate local inflammatory responses, and might even ameliorate ER stress and autophagy dysfunction. Notably, probiotic interventions have demonstrated the capacity to restore microbial balance, reduce gliadin-induced ER stress, and consequently improve barrier function (ferrari2021characterizationofmouse pages 70-74, NCT01574209).

Finally, integrative genomic studies have uncovered non-HLA genetic factors, including CTLA4, SH2B3, NCF2, RGS1, LPP, and UBASH3A, that further link immune regulation to epithelial stress. For instance, NCF2 is involved in reactive oxygen species generation—a process that intersects with both autophagy and cellular stress responses—while CTLA4 and UBASH3A modulate T-cell signaling to maintain immune tolerance. These genetic associations underscore the complexity of the innate and adaptive interplay in celiac disease and represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention (OpenTargets Search: celiac disease, OpenTargets Search: celiac disease).

In summary, targeting epithelial stress sensors, autophagy and ER stress pathways, along with strategies to modulate microbiome-derived metabolites, offers a promising, multifaceted approach to managing celiac disease beyond the traditional focus on HLA-DQ2/8-mediated T-cell responses (ferrari2021characterizationofmouse pages 14-18, clinical Trials Search: celiac disease AND (epithelial stress OR autophagy OR endoplasmic reticulum stress OR microbiome OR intestinal barrier OR immune activation)).
