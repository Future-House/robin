Query: High-throughput screening approaches and small-molecule libraries evaluated for restoration of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity in gluten-induced permeability models of celiac disease, including assay protocols, hit identification criteria, and validation strategies in cell and organoid systems

Based on the evaluated context, there is no published evidence or registered clinical trial that has employed high‐throughput screening (HTS) approaches or small‐molecule libraries to restore intestinal epithelial barrier integrity in gluten-induced permeability models of celiac disease. Specifically, queries on ClinicalTrials.gov using the terms “high‐throughput screening,” “small-molecule,” “intestinal epithelial barrier,” “celiac disease,” and “gluten” returned zero results, which indicates that no clinical-stage studies have yet adopted these strategies or provided any associated assay protocols, hit identification criteria, or follow-up validation strategies in either cell-based or organoid models (Clinical Trials Search: high-throughput screening AND small-molecule AND intestinal epithelial barrier AND celiac disease AND gluten).

Furthermore, several experimental reports have characterized models relevant for studying gluten-induced epithelial dysfunction. For example, studies using human gut-derived organoids and enteroid systems have demonstrated reliable assays to measure barrier function using parameters such as transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), permeability measurements with fluorescent probes (e.g., FITC-dextran or FITC-PEG 400), and even enteroid swelling assays to assess CFTR-mediated fluid secretion (thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 106-109, freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 3-4). However, these papers primarily focus on mechanistic characterization of epithelial alterations induced by gliadin peptides rather than on the development or application of HTS protocols for screening compounds.

No description regarding the adaptation of high-throughput assay formats (e.g., multiwell plate-based assays) has been provided. Similarly, there is no detailed disclosure on criteria for “hit” identification—such as threshold improvements in barrier integrity, reproducibility statistics, or penetrance of small molecules—that one would expect in an HTS campaign. In addition, built-in validation strategies such as secondary assays in both cell monolayers and 3D organoid cultures that confirm barrier restoration and provide mechanistic insights are also not discussed in the cited literature (thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 101-106, freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 1-2).

Other supportive evidence from our curated sources—such as those discussing the role of specific molecules like larazotide acetate (a zonulin receptor antagonist) in restoring barrier function—simply underscore the clinical interest in modulating epithelial integrity in celiac disease. Yet, this therapeutic work does not detail HTS methods nor does it use small-molecule libraries that were screened in high-throughput formats to derive such compounds (valitutti2019breakingdownbarriers pages 8-9). Similarly, the Open Targets Platform provides genetic and literature evidence linking several targets to celiac disease, but it does not include any data on HTS applications, assay design, or hit validation specific to barrier restoration in gluten-triggered models (OpenTargets Search: celiac disease).

In summary, while multiple studies have established relevant in vitro models (including organoids and enteroids) to assess epithelial barrier dysfunction induced by gluten or gliadin peptides, there is no reported information—neither in the clinical trial registries nor in the experimental research articles—on the use of high-throughput screening methodologies or small-molecule library evaluations targeted at restoring barrier function. Thus, the protocols, criteria for hit selection, and validation strategies necessary for a comprehensive drug discovery approach in this particular niche remain unreported in the provided context (Clinical Trials Search: high-throughput screening AND small-molecule AND intestinal epithelial barrier AND celiac disease AND gluten, thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 101-106, freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 3-4).
