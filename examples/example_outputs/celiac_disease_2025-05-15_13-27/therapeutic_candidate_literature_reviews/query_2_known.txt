Query: Known or emerging molecular targets and pathways modulating tight junction assembly and barrier function in intestinal epithelium dysregulated by gliadin or zonulin in celiac disease, with evidence from genetic or pharmacological intervention studies demonstrating target validation

The molecular mechanisms controlling tight junction (TJ) assembly and barrier function in celiac disease (CD) have been dissected extensively using both genetic and pharmacological interventions. Several key pathways and targets have emerged as central mediators in the disruption induced by gliadin and zonulin.

One well‐established pathway is the zonulin signaling cascade. Gliadin binds to the CXCR3 receptor on intestinal epithelial cells, recruiting the adaptor protein MyD88, which triggers zonulin release. Zonulin (pre‐haptoglobin 2) then engages receptors—most notably protease‐activated receptor 2 (PAR2)—resulting in the transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Activation of downstream effectors such as phospholipase C (PLC) increases intracellular calcium, thereby activating protein kinase C alpha (PKCα). PKCα phosphorylates critical TJ proteins such as ZO-1 and occludin and induces actin cytoskeletal rearrangements that culminate in TJ disassembly and increased permeability. Pharmacological inhibition of this cascade with larazotide acetate has been shown to restore barrier integrity in both animal models and early-phase clinical trials, directly validating the zonulin-PAR2-EGFR axis as a viable therapeutic target (ailioaie2022celiacdiseaseand pages 14-15, sturgeon2016zonulinaregulator pages 11-15).

Another target is the CXCR3-MyD88 pathway per se. Experiments in gliadin-challenged models have demonstrated that CXCR3 knockout animals fail to induce zonulin release and subsequent TJ disruption, confirming that the CXCR3 receptor is critical for initiating the molecular events leading to barrier dysfunction. This discovery not only underpins the pathogenic role of gliadin in CD but also offers CXCR3 as a potential target for intervention (khaleghi2016thepotentialutility pages 1-2, valitutti2019breakingdownbarriers pages 6-8).

The integrity of TJ proteins themselves—specifically ZO-1, occludin, and claudins—represents another cornerstone of barrier regulation. Gliadin exposure is accompanied by decreased membrane localization, altered phosphorylation, and misassembly of these proteins. Moreover, shifts in the balance between pore-forming (e.g., claudin-2) and pore-sealing claudins further exacerbate permeability defects. Investigations employing both genetic models and targeted pharmacological approaches support that restoring proper expression and localization of these proteins, particularly through modulation of their phosphorylation states, can re-establish normal barrier function (cardososilva2019intestinalbarrierfunction pages 5-7, cardososilva2019intestinalbarrierfunction pages 7-9).

Actin cytoskeleton dynamics play an equally pivotal role. Both gliadin and zonulin signaling initiate actin rearrangements via myosin light chain kinases and related proteins such as myosin-IXb. Genetic models lacking these cytoskeletal regulators exhibit heightened permeability, underscoring their contribution to TJ stability. Pharmacological strategies that inhibit the molecular effectors of cytoskeletal contraction can thus help maintain the structural integrity of TJs (odenwald2017theintestinalepithelial pages 7-9, serek2021theeffectof pages 8-9).

Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-15, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) exacerbate barrier dysfunction indirectly. These cytokines can modulate the expression and post-translational modification of TJ proteins. Their role as secondary effectors—while not directly initiating TJ disassembly—validates an immunomodulatory approach as an adjunct strategy to protect and restore barrier function in genetically predisposed individuals (cardososilva2019intestinalbarrierfunction pages 7-9, barbara2021inflammatoryandmicrobiotarelated pages 10-11).

In summary, emerging evidence from both genetic knockout studies (targeting CXCR3, PAR2, and cytoskeletal components) and pharmacological interventions (notably larazotide acetate) robustly validates the zonulin-CXCR3-MyD88-PAR2-EGFR-PKCα signaling cascade, as well as the proper regulation of TJ proteins and the actin cytoskeleton, as critical modulators of intestinal epithelial barrier function in CD. These data underscore the potential therapeutic utility of targeting these molecular pathways to restore TJ integrity and mitigate the pathogenesis of celiac disease.
