Proposal for Lactobacillus casei ATCC 9595

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Lactobacillus casei ATCC 9595 is a probiotic strain isolated from natural fermentation sources, typically found in dairy products, and belongs to the broader class of lactic acid bacteria. As a live biotherapeutic agent, it is a naturally derived microorganism rather than a synthetically produced compound. Probiotics such as L. casei have been historically used to promote gastrointestinal health and restore microbial balance in the gut, and their “secretome” – the collection of low molecular weight bioactive metabolites and peptides secreted by the bacterium – is of particular interest for therapeutic applications. This candidate falls within the live biotherapeutic product (LBP) class that has been previously explored for various gastrointestinal disorders, where the aim is to modulate the microbiome and enhance the intestinal barrier function (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Marasco et al., 2020, p. 5). These agents are typically produced via controlled fermentation processes, and their formulation can include live bacteria, heat-killed cells, or filtered culture supernatants containing the secretome; in the case of L. casei ATCC 9595, its secreted bioactive molecules are hypothesized to mediate its beneficial effects. The use of live microbes as therapeutics has gained traction owing to their favorable safety profiles and the ability to exert local effects in the gut, including barrier stabilization and immunomodulation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Lactobacillus casei strains, as a class, have been extensively studied and applied in both preclinical and clinical settings for a variety of gastrointestinal conditions. Their use ranges from preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea to modulating inflammatory conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Several studies have evaluated the impact of Lactobacillus species on intestinal barrier function and microbiota composition, and L. casei ATCC 9595 itself has been implicated in models where it preserved transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and prevented abnormal localization of tight junction proteins in Caco-2 cell monolayers (Samak et al., 2021, pp. 2–4; Marasco et al., 2020, p. 5). Although dedicated clinical trials solely focused on L. casei ATCC 9595 in celiac disease remain limited, related clinical investigations and multi-strain formulations including Lactobacillus casei have been evaluated in celiac patients, particularly in the context of co‐morbid IBS symptoms (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2012). Preclinical studies in animal models have further provided evidence that Lactobacillus casei can modulate immune responses and improve mucosal architecture following gliadin exposure, which is a central pathological trigger in celiac disease (Wagh et al., 2022, pp. 8–9; Catassi et al., 2024, p. 9). Thus, the historical use of Lactobacillus casei and its safety profile in both human and veterinary contexts underpins its consideration as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease.

Mechanism of Action:
The proposed mechanism by which Lactobacillus casei ATCC 9595 might exert its therapeutic effect in celiac disease is predicated on its secretome’s capacity to downregulate key intracellular signaling pathways involved in tight junction regulation and inflammatory responses. Gliadin peptides, upon ingestion, are known to trigger a cascade of events in the intestinal epithelium that lead to disassembly of tight junctions. This process is largely mediated by the activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and protein kinase C alpha (PKCα), resulting in the phosphorylation of tight junction proteins such as occludin and ZO-1, and leading to increased paracellular permeability (Ghodsi et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Orlando et al., 2014, pp. 11–12). Preclinical investigations using Caco-2 cell models have demonstrated that exposure to gliadin can lead to a decline in TEER and a redistribution of tight junction proteins away from their typical intercellular localization. L. casei ATCC 9595 is hypothesized to counteract these deleterious effects by secreting bioactive metabolites that inhibit the overactivation of MLCK and PKCα pathways. By limiting the phosphorylation of tight junction components, the secretome supports the maintenance of barrier integrity under gliadin challenge (Samak et al., 2021, pp. 12–14; Zhai et al., 2019, p. 8).

More specifically, the secreted peptides and metabolites may interact directly with epithelial cells, interfering with the intracellular signaling cascades triggered by gliadin. These interactions likely involve modulating the activity of kinases that govern cytoskeletal dynamics; for example, a reduction in MLCK activity would attenuate actomyosin contraction, a central process in tight junction disassembly. Likewise, affecting PKCα activity could stabilize the arrangement of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 and occludin, thereby preserving the epithelial barrier’s function (Samak et al., 2021, pp. 12–14; Orlando et al., 2014, pp. 8–10). This hypothesis is supported by evidence in which L. casei and other Lactobacillus species have demonstrated the capacity to sustain TEER and prevent tight junction protein delocalization under various stress conditions, albeit most of the available data specifically pertain to osmotic or inflammatory stress rather than gliadin-induced epithelial disruption (Orlando et al., 2014, pp. 8–10; Samak et al., 2021, pp. 7–10).

Furthermore, while direct clinical evidence for Lactobacillus casei ATCC 9595 modulating MLCK or PKCα in the context of gliadin exposure is sparse, the collective body of literature suggests that these pathways are critical for barrier disruption in celiac disease. This provides a strong translational rationale whereby the secretome of L. casei ATCC 9595 could exert a protective, stabilizing effect on the epithelial barrier by reducing pro-inflammatory kinase activation and preserving the normal architecture of tight junctions. It is also noteworthy that probiotics are known to modulate immune responses by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and interferon-gamma, which further contributes to maintaining barrier integrity (Ghodsi et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Marasco et al., 2020, pp. 3–5).

Expected Effect:
In the highly controlled assays proposed, such as those utilizing Caco-2 cell monolayers to mimic the human intestinal epithelium, L. casei ATCC 9595 is expected to manifest its effects primarily by preserving barrier integrity. Under gliadin challenge, the typical response is a marked decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and a consequent redistribution of key tight junction proteins like occludin and ZO-1 away from the cell membrane into the cytoplasm. The expected effector function of the L. casei secretome is a mitigation of these events; in other words, the therapeutic should maintain normal TEER values and ensure that proteins such as ZO-1 remain appropriately localized at the intercellular junctions (Samak et al., 2021, pp. 12–14; Orlando et al., 2014, pp. 11–12).

At the molecular level, the inhibition of MLCK and PKCα activation by constituents of the secretome should theoretically translate to a reduction in gliadin-induced phosphorylation events that lead to tight junction disruption. This would not only preserve physical barrier properties but also reduce the epithelial cell exposure to gliadin peptides — a central pathophysiologic step in the development of celiac disease-related mucosal inflammation (Zhai et al., 2019, p. 8; Marasco et al., 2020, p. 5). Moreover, if L. casei ATCC 9595 diminishes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines as part of a broader immunomodulatory effect, the anticipated result would be an overall decrease in local inflammatory responses and improved mucosal homeostasis, which are crucial for alleviating the epithelial injury observed in celiac disease (Wagh et al., 2022, pp. 8–9).

Given that gliadin-induced epithelial permeability is central to celiac disease pathogenesis, the preservation of tight junction integrity and epithelial barrier function by L. casei ATCC 9595 could serve as a complementary therapeutic strategy alongside a gluten-free diet. The underlying hypothesis posits that when applied in a clinical scenario, this probiotic could reduce the translocation of immunogenic gluten peptides, thereby ameliorating downstream immune activation and mucosal damage (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Marasco et al., 2020, p. 5). In vitro assays using human intestinal cell lines like Caco-2, along with animal models of gliadin-induced enteropathy, are expected to yield a demonstrable protective effect that correlates with improved barrier function and reduced inflammatory signaling, as measured by standard assays such as TEER, immunofluorescence for junctional protein localization, and kinase activity assays.

Overall Evaluation:
Lactobacillus casei ATCC 9595 emerges as a promising live biotherapeutic candidate for the treatment of celiac disease based on its favorable safety profile, established use as a probiotic in gastrointestinal disorders, and mechanistic actions that align well with the pathophysiology of celiac disease. One of the primary strengths of this candidate is its natural origin and extensive precedent as a probiotic agent that has been safely administered in various clinical and preclinical studies. The ability of its secretome to interfere with key intracellular signaling cascades implicated in tight junction disruption—specifically via the downregulation of MLCK and PKCα activation—addresses a critical aspect of celiac disease pathology, namely the gliadin-induced “leaky gut” phenomenon (Samak et al., 2021, pp. 12–14; Orlando et al., 2014, pp. 11–12).

Furthermore, supportive evidence from in vitro studies using Caco-2 models has demonstrated that similar Lactobacillus strains are capable of preserving transepithelial electrical resistance and maintaining the correct localization of tight junction proteins under stress conditions. This provides a strong rationale for expecting that L. casei ATCC 9595 could mitigate the epithelial barrier disruption induced by gliadin, with subsequent beneficial effects on mucosal immunity and inflammation (Zhai et al., 2019, p. 8; Marasco et al., 2020, p. 5).

However, several weaknesses and gaps remain that warrant cautious interpretation. While the mechanistic data obtained from related studies are robust, direct evidence focusing specifically on L. casei ATCC 9595 in the context of gliadin-induced epithelial damage is still sparse. Many of the cited studies assess osmotic or inflammatory stress rather than the unique challenge posed by gliadin peptides, and the extrapolation of these findings to celiac disease must be validated through targeted biochemical assays and animal model studies. Additionally, although the safety profile of Lactobacillus casei as a probiotic is well established, specific clinical trial data evaluating its efficacy for celiac disease remain limited, with most studies focusing on multi-strain formulations rather than the ATCC 9595 strain alone (Wagh et al., 2022, pp. 8–9; Seiler et al., 2020, pp. 9–10; Catassi et al., 2024, p. 9).

In summary, the strengths of Lactobacillus casei ATCC 9595 lie in its established use as a probiotic, its mechanistic potential to reduce MLCK and PKCα activation thereby preserving epithelial barrier integrity, and its overall favorable safety profile. The weaknesses reside in the relative paucity of direct preclinical and clinical data specifically addressing its effects in celiac disease, particularly concerning gliadin-induced permeability and downstream immune activation. Consequently, while the candidate is biologically plausible and mechanistically promising, additional rigorous studies—both at the in vitro and in vivo levels, complemented by well-designed clinical trials—will be essential to fully validate the therapeutic potential of L. casei ATCC 9595 for use in celiac disease (Wagh et al., 2022, pp. 8–9; Seiler et al., 2020, pp. 9–10; Catassi et al., 2024, p. 9).
