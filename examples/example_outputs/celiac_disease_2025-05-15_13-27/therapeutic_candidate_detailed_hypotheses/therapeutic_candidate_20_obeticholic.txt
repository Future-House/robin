Proposal for Obeticholic acid (OCA)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a semisynthetic bile acid derivative originally synthesized as a 6-ethyl analogue of chenodeoxycholic acid. It belongs to the class of FXR (farnesoid X receptor) agonists, which are synthetic ligands designed to target a nuclear hormone receptor that is widely expressed in the liver, intestine, and other tissues. The clinical development of OCA began with the intent to harness the potent FXR agonistic activity—approximately 100‐fold greater than that of natural chenodeoxycholic acid—to modulate bile acid homeostasis, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and inflammatory signaling. FXR agonists have been used primarily for cholestatic liver diseases (e.g., primary biliary cholangitis) and metabolic liver disorders such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and their clinical safety profiles are well characterized when administered orally (Ali & Lindor, 2016; Hegyi et al., 2018). As a member of this therapeutic class, OCA combines the favorable pharmacokinetic properties of an orally bioavailable bile acid derivative with the molecular capacity to regulate key genes involved in bile acid synthesis and transport. Its development capitalized on the understanding that FXR plays an essential role not only in liver homeostasis but also in maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity and mucosal immunity (Calzadilla et al., 2022; Mouries et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, OCA has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, demonstrating its ability to alter bile acid metabolism and reduce hepatic inflammation (Ali & Lindor, 2016). In clinical trials such as those investigating OCA for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cholestatic liver diseases, the compound has shown consistent anti‐inflammatory and antifibrotic effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024). Although its primary indication is directed at liver disorders, preclinical studies in rodent models have suggested that FXR agonists, including OCA, can reduce intestinal permeability, enhance tight junction integrity, and modulate immune responses in the gut (Stojancevic et al., 2012; Úbeda et al., 2016). This mechanistic potential provides an intriguing rationale for repurposing OCA in inflammatory and autoimmune gut conditions, such as celiac disease—a disorder characterized by gliadin‐triggered epithelial dysfunction, abnormal zonulin release, and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-15 and TNF-α (Mouries et al., 2019; Ferrari et al., 2021). No clinical data to date have directly evaluated OCA in celiac disease, but multiple analogous disease models—ranging from primary biliary cholangitis to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)—offer supportive evidence suggesting that its barrier‐protective and anti‐inflammatory properties might be beneficial in conditions marked by disrupted mucosal integrity.

Mechanism of Action:
OCA exerts its pharmacologic effects primarily through agonistic binding to the FXR receptor, a ligand‐activated transcription factor that governs expression of numerous genes involved in bile acid synthesis, transport, and metabolism. Upon binding to FXR, OCA prompts the receptor to form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), subsequently binding to FXR response elements (FXREs) in the promoter regions of target genes (Stojancevic et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2018). This activation triggers a cascade that results in the upregulation of genes such as small heterodimer partner (SHP) and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) (Ali & Lindor, 2016), leading to feedback inhibition of bile acid synthesis enzymes like CYP7A1 and increased expression of bile acid transporters such as OSTα/β and BSEP (Guo et al., 2018). In addition to regulating bile acid metabolism, FXR activation by OCA has been shown to upregulate tight junction proteins and other barrier‐protective genes—in experimental models, FXR stimulation has been linked to increased expression of proteins such as claudins, occludin, and ZO-1 (Stojancevic et al., 2012; Úbeda et al., 2016). Moreover, FXR activation confers anti‐inflammatory effects by suppressing the transcription of key proinflammatory cytokines including IL-15, TNF-α, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which are known to orchestrate mucosal immune responses and barrier dysfunction (Ho & Steinman, 2016; Mouries et al., 2019). Biochemical studies suggest that OCA can inhibit pathways leading to excessive zonulin release—an important modulator of tight junction disassembly—thereby potentially reducing gliadin‐induced permeability increases in the gut epithelium (Calzadilla et al., 2022). By reducing the inflammatory milieu and promoting reinforcement of the epithelial barrier, OCA may indirectly attenuate the autoimmune processes that are critical to celiac disease pathogenesis.

Expected Effect:
Based on the proposed hypothesis, OCA is expected to exert several beneficial effects when applied to gliadin‐exposed intestinal epithelial models. First, by activating FXR, OCA should enhance the expression of barrier‐protective genes such as claudin-3 and various mucins, leading to a strengthening of the epithelial tight junctions and a reduction in paracellular permeability. Precedent for this effect comes from studies in which FXR agonists were shown to upregulate tight junction components in rodent models of colitis and cholestatic liver injury (Stojancevic et al., 2012; Úbeda et al., 2016). Second, the compound is expected to suppress the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-15 and TNF-α, as evidenced by reductions observed in inflammatory bowel disease models where FXR activation led to decreased cytokine expression and reduced immune cell infiltration (Mouries et al., 2019; Verbeke et al., 2015). Finally, OCA is hypothesized to mitigate zonulin release, a key step in the disruption of tight junction architecture in gliadin‐induced epithelial dysfunction. Although direct evidence in gliadin‐specific models is limited, related studies have linked FXR signaling to the maintenance of mucosal integrity and modulation of zonulin‐like pathways (Calzadilla et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2023). The overall expected outcome is a restoration of epithelial barrier homeostasis, decreased permeability allowing reduced translocation of luminal antigens, and a dampening of the inflammatory cascade typically observed in celiac disease. This multifaceted mechanism would be of particular significance in gut organoid systems and rodent models of gluten sensitivity, where the normalization of barrier function and suppression of cytokine‐mediated inflammation could translate into improved clinical outcomes.

Overall Evaluation:
The potential of OCA as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease is supported by its well‐characterized pharmacological profile as an FXR agonist, its documented anti‐inflammatory and barrier‐preserving effects, and its favorable safety and oral bioavailability demonstrated in liver disease clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Ali & Lindor, 2016). Strengths of OCA include its potent and selective FXR activation ability, which is central to the regulation of genes controlling bile acid metabolism, epithelial tight junction integrity, and inflammatory responses (Stojancevic et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2018). These properties are directly relevant to the pathogenesis of celiac disease, where gliadin exposure disrupts epithelial barrier function through zonulin release and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-15 and TNF-α (Ferrari et al., 2021; Mouries et al., 2019). Additionally, the extensive preclinical evidence showing that FXR agonists enhance barrier function and reduce inflammatory cytokine levels in models of intestinal injury provides mechanistic support for the hypothesis that OCA could improve outcomes in celiac disease (Calzadilla et al., 2022; Úbeda et al., 2016).

However, there are weaknesses and uncertainties that warrant caution. The current literature does not include direct clinical or experimental studies of OCA in celiac disease models; thus, much of the support is extrapolated from related inflammatory gut disorders and liver disease where barrier dysfunction is prominent (Stojancevic et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2022). While the molecular framework is compelling, it remains to be directly demonstrated whether OCA can reduce zonulin release specifically in gliadin‐exposed epithelium or whether the modulation of FXR activity will fully translate into the restoration of tight junction integrity in this context (Shi et al., 2023; Mouries et al., 2019). There is also the consideration that FXR signaling may have complex tissue‐specific effects, with potential differences in intestinal versus hepatic responses that need to be rigorously delineated (Stojancevic et al., 2012; Úbeda et al., 2016).

Overall, OCA presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in celiac disease owing to its robust FXR agonism, its anti‐inflammatory capacity, and its documented role in enhancing epithelial barrier function in several preclinical models. Its oral bioavailability and established safety profile in the context of liver disease further support its potential for clinical testing in celiac disease. Nonetheless, targeted studies are necessary to investigate its specific effects on gliadin‐induced epithelial dysfunction, including direct assessments of tight junction protein expression (such as claudin-3 and mucins), zonulin release, and the suppression of cytokines like IL-15 and TNF-α in celiac‐specific models. In summary, while significant preclinical evidence and mechanistic reasoning support further research into OCA for celiac disease, early proof‐of‐concept studies in relevant models will be essential to validate its efficacy in this new therapeutic context (Ali & Lindor, 2016; Úbeda et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2022).
