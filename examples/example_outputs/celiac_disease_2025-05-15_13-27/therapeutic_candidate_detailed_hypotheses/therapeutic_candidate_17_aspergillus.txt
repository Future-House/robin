Proposal for Aspergillus niger prolyl endopeptidase (AN-PEP)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Aspergillus niger prolyl endopeptidase (AN-PEP) is an enzyme isolated from the food‐grade fungus Aspergillus niger. It belongs to the class of prolyl endopeptidases—proteolytic enzymes that selectively cleave peptide bonds at the carboxyl side of proline residues, which is a critical property when targeting gluten proteins. Gluten, particularly in its gliadin fractions, contains multiple proline-rich regions that are resistant to normal gastrointestinal proteases. AN-PEP was originally discovered and characterized for its application in food processing; for example, it has been employed in brewing to prevent chill haze formation by degrading barley‐derived, proline‐rich proteins (Akeroyd et al., 2016; Mitea et al., 2008). As a naturally derived fungal enzyme, its designation as food-grade confers an advantage in safety relative to enzymes of bacterial origin. Enzymes of this class have long been used in various industrial applications to digest recalcitrant proteins and peptides, and their adaptation to oral therapy leverages their capacity to function under acidic conditions, similar to those of the human stomach (Gass & Khosla, 2007; Cafiero et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
AN-PEP has been evaluated extensively in preclinical studies and early-phase human trials as a digestive aid, particularly to reduce the immunogenic potential of gluten peptides in individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Clinical trial data from studies such as those registered under NCT00810654 and NCT04788797 have investigated the enzyme’s effectiveness when administered orally with gluten challenges, providing evidence that the enzyme can degrade gluten in vivo (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). In addition, previous biochemical studies have confirmed that AN-PEP degrades gliadin peptides—including the notoriously immunogenic 33‐mer—under simulated gastrointestinal conditions (Mitea et al., 2008; Brzozowski et al., 2020). Although its primary historical use has been in the food and brewing industries, enhancing product quality by reducing haze or bitterness (Akeroyd et al., 2016), these same properties have prompted investigation into its repurposing as an orally administered therapeutic candidate for celiac disease. While several clinical trials have shown that AN-PEP has good tolerability when used in gluten challenge studies, efficacy endpoints such as mucosal protection and symptom alleviation have varied across studies (Cafiero et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, AN-PEP functions by cleaving peptide bonds at the carboxyl side of proline residues. This specificity is essential because immunogenic fragments of gliadin, particularly the 33‐mer peptide, are highly enriched in proline and glutamine residues. These peptides resist degradation by conventional gastrointestinal proteases like pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin, thereby surviving intact to stimulate T cell responses in genetically predisposed individuals with celiac disease (Janssen et al., 2015; Mitea et al., 2008). AN-PEP, however, exhibits optimal activity in the acidic pH range similar to that of the stomach (approximately pH 4–5), and it is resistant to inactivation by pepsin. This enables it to efficiently attack the structure of gluten before it reaches the small intestine, where the peptides would normally interact with antigen-presenting cells and trigger an immune response (Gass & Khosla, 2007; Dunaevsky et al., 2021). Furthermore, emerging preclinical studies suggest that treatment of gliadin with AN-PEP prior to epithelial exposure prevents measurable reductions in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and occludin mislocalization in ex vivo organoid models. Such damage is typically mediated by the zonulin pathway, in which immunogenic gluten peptides disrupt tight junction integrity to induce paracellular leakage and subsequent inflammatory cascades (Durham & Ince, 2024; Brzozowski et al., 2020). Hence, by reducing the burden of intact, immunotoxic peptides, AN-PEP is hypothesized to lower zonulin-mediated barrier disruption and downstream inflammatory responses.

Expected Effect:
Based on its biochemical profile and the preclinical data available, the expected therapeutic effect of AN-PEP in celiac disease is two-fold. First, by degrading immunogenic gliadin peptides—including the 33-mer fragment—AN-PEP is expected to decrease the number of peptides that can trigger immune responses after crossing the epithelial barrier. This degradation should result in a marked reduction in T-cell activation and the subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby mitigating the intestinal inflammation characteristic of celiac disease (Janssen et al., 2015; Mitea et al., 2008). Second, the preservation of gut barrier integrity is anticipated via preventing zonulin release. In ex vivo organoid barrier assays, the pre-treatment of gliadin with AN-PEP prevented the decrease in TEER and abnormal localization of tight junction proteins such as occludin—a mechanism indicative of barrier protective effects (Durham & Ince, 2024; Brzozowski et al., 2020). In clinical contexts, even subtle breaches in barrier integrity can lead to enhanced antigen penetration and subsequent immune cascade activation. Therefore, the enzyme’s rapid kinetics and its compatibility with the gastric environment mean that, when taken orally, it should be able to pre-digest gluten molecules in the stomach, reducing the exposure of the small intestinal epithelium to intact immunogenic fragments. Consequently, this reduced exposure is expected to blunt the activation of HLA-DQ2/DQ8-restricted T cells and lower the overall production of inflammatory mediators, ultimately contributing to a decrease in mucosal damage and associated symptomatology in celiac patients (Mitea et al., 2008; Ge & Chen, 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
AN-PEP represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for celiac disease based on its well-characterized enzymatic properties, robust preclinical data, and favorable safety profile in early human trials. One of the greatest strengths of AN-PEP is its specificity for proline-rich immunogenic peptides—chief among them the 33‐mer from gliadin—which are central to celiac disease’s pathogenesis. Its optimal activity in acidic conditions ensures that it performs effectively in the stomach, where conventional human proteases fail, thereby intercepting gluten before it can trigger downstream immune responses (Gass & Khosla, 2007; Mitea et al., 2008). Additionally, the enzyme’s prior use in the brewing and food industries underlines its safety profile, while clinical trial data in gluten challenge studies have demonstrated that AN-PEP is well tolerated when administered to humans (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008). Evidence from ex vivo organoid models further supports the hypothesis that AN-PEP not only detoxifies gluten peptides but also protects the gut barrier from disruption, potentially preventing zonulin-mediated leakage and reducing subsequent inflammatory cascades (Durham & Ince, 2024; Brzozowski et al., 2020).

However, several challenges remain. First, while the enzyme’s biochemical characteristics and rapid action in vitro are promising, clinical endpoints in celiac studies have been variable. Some clinical trials report that although AN-PEP efficiently degrades gluten, it has yet to demonstrate consistent reductions in mucosal damage or clinical symptoms in larger patient populations (Cafiero et al., 2024; Scalvini et al., 2025). Second, the efficacy of AN-PEP may be influenced by the complexity of food matrices; while controlled in vitro models (such as the TIM system) indicate effective gluten degradation, the digestion of realistic meals with variable compositions may require careful optimization of dosing regimens (Mitea et al., 2008; Janssen et al., 2015). Third, the direct link between gluten degradation by AN-PEP and downstream effects on tight junction integrity or modulation of zonulin-mediated barrier disruption—while supported by ex vivo data—still demands further clinical validation, including studies that correlate enzyme activity in the stomach with measures of intestinal permeability and inflammatory biomarkers in vivo (Durham & Ince, 2024; Brzozowski et al., 2020).

In summary, the overall strengths of AN-PEP for treating celiac disease lie in its targeted enzymatic activity, its ability to operate under gastric conditions, and its excellent safety profile demonstrated in prior food and clinical studies (Mitea et al., 2008; Gass & Khosla, 2007). Its mechanism of directly cleaving the immunogenic gluten peptides before they can interact with the intestinal epithelium addresses a key pathogenic step in celiac disease. Nonetheless, its clinical utility will ultimately depend on its ability to demonstrate meaningful improvements in mucosal healing and symptom reduction in larger, well-designed clinical trials. Presently, while the biochemical and ex vivo evidence is robust, comprehensive clinical endpoints—including long-term effects on gut barrier integrity and downstream inflammatory responses—remain to be definitively established. Therefore, AN-PEP is a promising candidate that warrants further detailed clinical investigation but also requires careful optimization of dosing and formulation to ensure that its potent gluten-degrading activity translates into tangible clinical benefits for patients with celiac disease (Turck et al., 2017; Dunaevsky et al., 2021).
