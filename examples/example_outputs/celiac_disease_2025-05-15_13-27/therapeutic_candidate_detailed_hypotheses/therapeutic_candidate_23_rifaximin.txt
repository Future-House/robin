Proposal for Rifaximin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rifaximin is an oral, non‐absorbable antibiotic that belongs to the rifamycin class and was originally derived from naturally occurring rifamycins produced by Streptomyces species. Its unique chemical structure, achieved through semi‐synthetic modifications, confers it a high degree of stability within the gastrointestinal tract without leading to significant systemic absorption. This class of compounds has been predominantly used to treat gastrointestinal disorders such as travelers’ diarrhea, hepatic encephalopathy, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (DuPont, 2015). Rifaximin’s mechanism has traditionally been understood to rely on the inhibition of bacterial RNA synthesis via binding to the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which accounts for its bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects. More recently, however, its role as a pregnane X receptor (PXR) agonist has emerged as being equally significant; this repurposing phenomenon suggests that beyond reducing bacterial overgrowth, rifaximin may have a direct impact on host epithelial cells by modulating inflammatory signaling and reinforcing gut barrier integrity (DuPont, 2015; Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016). Its established safety profile and clinical use in IBS support its potential repurposing in inflammatory enteropathies such as celiac disease, where the pathogenesis involves both dysbiosis and impaired barrier function.

Therapeutic History:
Rifaximin has an extensive history of clinical use in several gastrointestinal conditions. It has been approved for the treatment of IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) and is widely used in the management of hepatic encephalopathy because of its ability to reduce ammonia-producing bacteria in the gut (DuPont, 2015). Clinical trials such as the one represented by NCT01137955 have evaluated rifaximin in celiac disease patients with persistent symptoms despite adherence to a gluten-free diet, although these trials primarily focused on symptom improvement and the modulation of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) rather than directly assessing improvements in barrier function (Chang et al., 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006). In a placebo-controlled study conducted by Chang and colleagues, rifaximin administration did not yield significant differences in gastrointestinal symptom ratings or lactulose hydrogen breath test results when compared to placebo, suggesting that its benefit in symptomatic celiac disease patients—at least with respect to SIBO-related symptoms—remains unproven (Chang et al., 2011). However, the interest in rifaximin for celiac disease arises from evolving insights into its PXR-mediated effects, previously observed in conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and hepatic conditions where barrier integrity is compromised (DuPont, 2016; Sartor, 2016). While there is no record of rifaximin being used as a frontline treatment for celiac disease itself, its historical use in analogous inflammatory enteropathies and IBS supports the hypothesis that its molecular activities—specifically PXR agonism—could be harnessed for barrier protection in celiac disease.

Mechanism of Action:
The classical mechanism associated with rifaximin is the inhibition of bacterial RNA synthesis by binding to the beta-subunit of the bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thereby exerting bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects in the intestinal lumen (DuPont, 2015). However, recent evidence has highlighted an additional and potentially crucial mechanism mediated by activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor that plays a vital role in the detoxification of xenobiotics and modulation of inflammatory responses in intestinal epithelial cells (Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016; DuPont, 2015). PXR activation by rifaximin leads to a cascade of gene regulatory events that result in upregulation of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, including cytochrome P450 isoforms such as CYP3A4, and the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1). This receptor is also implicated in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity by promoting the expression and proper localization of tight junction proteins, particularly zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-1, both of which are critical for sealing intercellular gaps between enterocytes (Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016; Sartor, 2016).

On a molecular level, PXR agonism initiates a complex interplay between detoxification, anti-inflammatory pathways, and barrier stabilization mechanisms. Rifaximin’s binding to PXR results in suppression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, a central pathway in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α. This downregulation of NF-κB not only reduces inflammation in the gut mucosa but also prevents the cytokine-induced upregulation of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), an enzyme known to disrupt tight junction integrity by promoting cytoskeletal contraction and disassembly of junctional complexes (Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016). In vitro studies using Caco-2 cell monolayers have provided evidence that rifaximin can attenuate cytokine-induced (TNF-α and interferon-γ) increases in epithelial permeability and prevent the relocalization or disruption of ZO-1 (Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016). These findings indicate that rifaximin’s PXR-mediated effect could directly translate to a strengthening of the intestinal barrier.

Furthermore, activation of PXR by rifaximin not only exerts anti-inflammatory effects but may also modulate the composition of the gut microbiota by reducing the adhesion and internalization of pathogenic bacteria while preserving beneficial microbial populations (DuPont, 2015; Weber et al., 2016). By altering microbial virulence and indirectly normalizing the microbiota, rifaximin might decrease the release of pro-inflammatory bacterial products (for example, lipopolysaccharide), further contributing to an improved mucosal environment in inflammatory conditions. Collectively, these molecular interactions position rifaximin as a compound with dual actions: antimicrobial activity on the gut flora and a potent host-directed mechanism via PXR activation, which together may contribute to decreased gliadin-induced permeability in celiac disease (Chang & Green, 2012; Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016).

Expected Effect:
Based on the proposed hypothesis, rifaximin is expected to exert its therapeutic effect in celiac disease through multiple synergistic mechanisms. First, by activating PXR in enterocytes, rifaximin should lead to an upregulation of barrier-protective xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, including CYP3A4 and MDR1, and reinforce tight junction integrity by enhancing the expression and proper localization of ZO-1 and claudin-1. This upregulation is anticipated to result in a direct improvement in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), which is a quantitative measure of barrier function in epithelial monolayers (Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016; Fujimoto et al., 2021). In a gluten-challenge organoid assay that mimics the gliadin-induced disruption seen in celiac disease, rifaximin should reduce the adverse effects of gliadin exposure. Specifically, the drug is expected to decrease the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, while simultaneously mitigating the deleterious effects of gliadin on barrier permeability. This dual action would lead to a sustained TEER and reduced permeability of the enterocyte monolayer (Fujimoto et al., 2021; Sartor, 2016).

In addition, rifaximin’s inherent antimicrobial activity is expected to selectively modulate the gut microbiota, reducing pathogenic bacterial overgrowth and inhibiting bacterial translocation, while sparing or even favoring beneficial commensal species. This is particularly relevant in the context of celiac disease, where dysbiosis is thought to contribute to mucosal inflammation and increased permeability (Chang & Green, 2012; ClinicalTrials.gov). Moreover, given that gliadin exposure in celiac disease can lead to an imbalance in the intestinal microenvironment, rifaximin may also help in normalizing the microbiota composition, thereby reducing the inflammatory load and further protecting the epithelial barrier.

At the cellular level, the expected outcome in a gluten-challenge assay would be the induction of PXR target genes in enterocytes and a corresponding decrease in inflammatory mediators. Data from in vitro models have shown that PXR activation can protect against cytokine-induced barrier dysfunction through inhibition of MLCK expression and reduced phosphorylation of stress signaling kinases such as JNK1/2, which are implicated in tight junction disruption (Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016). Additionally, since gliadin-induced permeability is partly mediated by immune responses that disrupt tight junctions, the anti-inflammatory property of rifaximin—mediated via PXR agonism—would further contribute to preserving barrier function, thereby reducing exposure of the underlying lamina propria to gluten peptides and subsequent immune activation (DuPont, 2016; Sartor, 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
Rifaximin presents several notable strengths as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease, particularly from the perspective of drug repurposing. Its long-established safety profile and current clinical use in treating IBS and hepatic encephalopathy support its potential for application in other inflammatory enteropathies. The dual mechanism of action—comprising both antimicrobial activity and host-directed modulation via PXR activation—is particularly attractive. By activating PXR, rifaximin is expected to enhance the expression of barrier-protective proteins such as ZO-1 and claudin-1 while simultaneously suppressing NF-κB–mediated pro-inflammatory responses (DuPont, 2015; Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016). This is a significant advantage given that celiac disease is characterized by increased intestinal permeability and chronic mucosal inflammation in response to gluten peptides (DuPont, 2015; Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016).

Moreover, although previous clinical trials in refractory celiac disease—such as the one identified under NCT01137955—did not demonstrate significant improvements in patient symptoms or SIBO markers following rifaximin treatment, these studies were primarily focused on symptom relief and did not directly assess the effects on gut barrier function or tight junction protein expression (Chang et al., 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006). Another strength of rifaximin is its localized effect in the gastrointestinal tract due to minimal systemic absorption, which reduces the risk of systemic side effects while concentrating its activity at the site of pathology (DuPont, 2015; Shayto et al., 2016).

On the other hand, there are also several challenges and weaknesses that deserve careful consideration. One major limitation is the mixed clinical data regarding its efficacy in celiac disease populations. The absence of significant symptom improvement in prior trials might indicate that while rifaximin could potentially enhance barrier function, such improvements do not necessarily translate into clinical benefit as measured by conventional symptom scales. This disconnect suggests that additional studies, possibly with modified endpoints that specifically evaluate barrier integrity (for instance, TEER measurements in organoids or mucosal biopsy analyses for tight junction proteins), are required to evaluate its true potential for celiac disease (Chang et al., 2011; Chang & Green, 2012).

Furthermore, the degree to which PXR activation directly influences gliadin-induced changes in permeability remains an open question. The interplay between microbial modulation and PXR-mediated transcription is complex and may vary between individuals. Variability in baseline PXR expression or differences in the genetic background of celiac disease patients could affect the consistency of therapeutic responses. Also, while rifaximin’s antimicrobial action may help correct dysbiosis, the clinical relevance of such microbial changes in the context of celiac disease remains less well established compared to conditions like IBS or IBD (ClinicalTrials.gov; DuPont, 2016).

Additionally, while the evidence supports that rifaximin can reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and improve barrier function in vitro using cell culture models such as Caco-2 cells, there is a need to translate these findings into robust clinical endpoints that matter to patients with celiac disease. The challenge will be designing clinical trials that can capture the nuances of barrier function improvement, possibly by incorporating biomarkers of tight junction integrity and inflammatory mediator levels, in addition to symptom-based endpoints (Chang et al., 2011; Chang & Green, 2012).

In summary, the overall evaluation of rifaximin as a repurposed drug candidate for celiac disease is cautiously optimistic. Its safety record, gut-specific activity, and dual action as both an antibiotic and a PXR agonist make it a promising candidate to target the epithelial barrier dysfunction central to celiac disease pathophysiology. However, previous clinical trials have not shown robust symptomatic benefits, and its impact on barrier-protective mechanisms has not been directly evaluated in celiac disease patients. Rigorous, mechanistically focused studies—such as gluten-challenge organoid assays measuring TEER, PXR target gene induction, and tight junction protein expression—are warranted to better define its potential. Strengths include its established use in other gastrointestinal disorders, its minimal systemic absorption, and its capacity to modulate key inflammatory and barrier-protective pathways. Weaknesses involve the uncertain translation of in vitro benefits to clinical efficacy in celiac populations and the need for more targeted biomarkers to quantify barrier function improvement. Based on the existing literature across biochemical, clinical, and molecular studies (Chang et al., 2011; DuPont, 2015; Erickson & Mukherjee, 2016; Fujimoto et al., 2021; Sartor, 2016), rifaximin merits further investigation as a candidate for modulating gliadin-induced barrier dysfunction in celiac disease, with the specific aim of harnessing its PXR agonism to protect and restore intestinal epithelial integrity.
