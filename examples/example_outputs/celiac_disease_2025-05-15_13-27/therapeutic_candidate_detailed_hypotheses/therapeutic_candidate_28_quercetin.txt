Proposal for Quercetin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Quercetin is a naturally occurring flavonol—a subgroup of polyphenolic compounds—that is widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-derived foods. It is not a synthetic drug but is obtained primarily from natural sources such as apples, onions, berries, and tea. Historically, quercetin was originally identified through phytochemical investigations of plant extracts, and its structure—characterized by a polyphenolic backbone with hydroxyl substituents at positions 3, 3′, 4′, 5, and 7 (3,3′,4′,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone)—was elucidated through classical methods of isolation and spectroscopic analysis (Suzuki & Hara, 2011). This compound belongs to the flavonoid family, a major class of antioxidants that have been traditionally used as nutraceutical supplements and, in some cases, have shown promise in modulating inflammatory processes in various diseases. Flavonoids in general have been extensively studied for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cytoprotective properties, and quercetin, in particular, is well known for its ability to modulate cellular signaling pathways that regulate inflammation and barrier integrity. The natural origin and ease of extraction from dietary sources along with its favorable safety profile provide an attractive basis for considering quercetin as a repurposed candidate for diseases characterized by barrier dysfunction such as celiac disease (Suzuki & Hara, 2011; Khursheed et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Quercetin has a long history of use in both preclinical and clinical contexts as a dietary supplement with putative benefits in cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and various inflammatory conditions. In preclinical models, quercetin has been consistently reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities; for example, studies in cell culture systems have demonstrated its capacity to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production, modulate NF-κB signaling, and reduce oxidative stress in several tissues. Its safety profile in human nutritional studies and its common use as a dietary supplement have been widely documented, with extensive pharmacokinetic studies confirming that quercetin glycosides are metabolized and absorbed in the small intestine—with extensive conjugation by the liver and enterohepatic recycling contributing to its bioavailability (Suzuki & Hara, 2011; Khursheed et al., 2020). Despite its broad application in inflammatory and oxidative stress-related conditions, quercetin has not been previously registered in clinical trials specifically for celiac disease or gluten-mediated barrier dysfunction, as indicated by searches on ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, several preclinical investigations using intestinal epithelial models (such as Caco-2 monolayers) have demonstrated that polyphenols—including quercetin—can modulate the integrity of the intestinal barrier, support tight junction maintenance, and mitigate inflammatory responses in conditions that mimic gluten-induced damage (Calabriso et al., 2022; Chayalak et al., 2024). Additionally, related studies using animal models and in vitro systems have underscored the potential of polyphenolic compounds for reducing gut permeability, suggesting that the pharmacological properties of quercetin may be extendable to celiac disease, which is characterized by a “leaky gut” in response to gluten exposure (Calabriso et al., 2022; Van Buiten & Elias, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, quercetin exerts its therapeutic action through several interrelated mechanisms that target key signaling pathways involved in inflammation and the regulation of the intestinal epithelial barrier. One of the primary mechanisms proposed is the inhibition of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), an enzyme that phosphorylates myosin light chain (MLC) to drive actomyosin contraction; this process is pivotal in the regulation of tight junction (TJ) permeability. In inflammatory settings, cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) induce the expression of MLCK via activation of transcription factors like NF-κB and ERK1/2. This upregulation leads to increased MLCK activity and subsequent disruption of tight junction proteins such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin, resulting in increased paracellular permeability (Chayalak et al., 2024; Deachapunya & Chayalak, 2023). Quercetin has been shown in Caco-2 cell models to inhibit the IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB and ERK1/2, thereby reducing MLCK gene transcription and protein expression as well as decreasing the levels of phosphorylated MLC (p-MLC). This inhibition preserves the structural integrity of tight junctions and maintains transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), a measure of barrier function (Chayalak et al., 2024).

In addition to its effects on MLCK, quercetin is also proposed to attenuate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling. ER stress is characterized by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen, which activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). One of the key markers of ER stress is the induction of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP, also known as DDIT3), which when upregulated, can lead to apoptosis and further compromise barrier integrity. Although direct experimental evidence for quercetin’s modulation of ER stress in enterocytes challenged by gluten remains sparse, literature suggests that quercetin and its derivatives are capable of decreasing ER stress markers such as GRP78 and CHOP in other cell types, thereby mitigating apoptosis and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Eisvand et al., 2022). Given that gliadin exposure in celiac disease is associated with ER stress, quercetin’s ability to modulate the UPR may be beneficial in reducing ER stress-induced damage in intestinal epithelial cells.

Furthermore, quercetin has been shown to upregulate tight junction proteins directly. Several studies have reported that quercetin enhances the expression and proper localization of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, occludin, and claudin family members in intestinal epithelial models like Caco-2 cells. This upregulation is crucial because the distribution and assembly of these proteins are directly linked to the maintenance of the epithelial barrier. The reinforcement of tight junctions by quercetin may occur through its ability to inhibit multiple protein kinases, including MLCK, and through the modulation of other signaling cascades—such as MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and protein kinase C (PKC)—that regulate tight junction dynamics (Calabriso et al., 2022; Suzuki & Hara, 2011).

The overall molecular interactions of quercetin include binding to specific kinase domains or acting as a free-radical scavenger, hence reducing oxidative stress that can otherwise exacerbate both inflammatory signaling and ER stress. Quercetin’s molecular structure, enriched with hydroxyl groups, allows it to chelate metal ions and neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further ensures that the inflammatory milieu is tempered (Khursheed et al., 2020). This multifaceted mechanism, comprising direct kinase inhibition, cytokine modulation, antioxidation, and upregulation of barrier proteins, forms the biochemical rationale underpinning the hypothesis that quercetin will inhibit MLCK and ER stress signaling in enterocytes, upregulate tight junction proteins, and mitigate gliadin-induced barrier dysfunction.

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay using gliadin-challenged Caco-2 monolayers and potentially intestinal organoids, quercetin is expected to exert several beneficial effects that directly address the pathological features of celiac disease. Based on the working hypothesis, quercetin should exert the following effects:

1. Inhibition of MLCK Activation:
Gliadin exposure in enterocytes is known to trigger the upregulation of MLCK via pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1β) and associated signaling pathways (NF-κB and ERK1/2). By inhibiting these transcription factors, quercetin will lower MLCK mRNA and protein levels, leading to a decrease in MLCK-mediated phosphorylation of myosin light chain (p-MLC). This is expected to result in diminished contraction of the peri-junctional actomyosin ring and preservation of tight junction integrity, ultimately maintaining barrier function. The anticipated outcome, measured by increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and decreased paracellular flux of markers like FITC-dextran, would confirm that the epithelial barrier remains intact (Chayalak et al., 2024).

2. Attenuation of ER Stress and UPR Signaling:
Gliadin-induced stress in enterocytes is associated with the upregulation of ER stress markers, including CHOP/DDIT3, which contribute to cellular apoptosis and disruption of the epithelial barrier. Quercetin is expected to mitigate these effects by inhibiting the ER stress response, resulting in lower levels of CHOP expression and reduced phosphorylation of translation initiation factors such as eIF2α. Although direct evidence in gliadin models remains to be established, analogous studies in other epithelial cell types have demonstrated quercetin’s capacity to reduce ER stress, suggesting that a similar effect should be observable in the context of gluten exposure (Eisvand et al., 2022).

3. Upregulation of Tight Junction Proteins:
Quercetin is anticipated to induce or stabilize the expression of key tight junction proteins such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1/TJP1), occludin, and claudins. The preservation or enhancement of these proteins’ expression and proper localization at the intercellular junctions will strengthen the intestinal barrier, thereby reducing gliadin-induced hyperpermeability. Experiments with Caco-2 monolayers have shown that dietary polyphenols can increase tight junction protein expression, and quercetin treatment is expected to translate to similar outcomes (Calabriso et al., 2022; Suzuki & Hara, 2011).

4. Reduction in Inflammatory Signaling:
By inhibiting NF-κB activation, quercetin is expected to lower the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6. This reduction in the inflammatory cascade not only limits further upregulation of MLCK but also contributes to an overall improvement in barrier function. Given that gliadin exposure is associated with increased oxidative stress and cytokine production, quercetin’s antioxidant properties may further reduce the pro-inflammatory environment in the gut (Chayalak et al., 2024; Calabriso et al., 2022).

5. Preservation of TEER and Barrier Function:
The integrated effects of MLCK inhibition, reduced ER stress, tight junction protein upregulation, and dampened inflammatory signaling are expected to result in maintained or improved TEER measurements in Caco-2 monolayers or human intestinal organoids upon gliadin challenge. This preservation of barrier function is a critical factor in mitigating the intestinal damage associated with celiac disease and supports the hypothesis that quercetin acts as an effective barrier-protective agent (Chayalak et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
The evidence from the literature supports a promising role for quercetin as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease particularly focused on intestinal barrier dysfunction. There are several strengths that enhance its candidacy:

• Quercetin is a naturally derived flavonol with a well-established safety profile; it is commonly consumed in the diet and has been used as a dietary supplement with extensive pharmacokinetic characterization (Suzuki & Hara, 2011; Khursheed et al., 2020).
• Its multifaceted mechanism of action—encompassing inhibition of MLCK via suppression of NF-κB and ERK1/2, attenuation of ER stress as indicated by reduced CHOP expression, and upregulation or stabilization of tight junction proteins like ZO-1—supports an integrated therapeutic approach to restoring intestinal barrier integrity (Chayalak et al., 2024; Deachapunya & Chayalak, 2023).
• Preclinical studies in Caco-2 models have demonstrated that quercetin effectively preserves barrier function under inflammatory conditions, as evidenced by maintained TEER and reduced paracellular permeability (Chayalak et al., 2024).
• The underlying rationale is reinforced by literature from related polyphenols and flavonoids, which have been reported to modulate enzymes and signaling pathways critical to intestinal permeability. This includes modulation of oxidative stress, downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and inhibition of kinases implicated in tight junction disassembly (Calabriso et al., 2022; Suzuki & Hara, 2011).

However, there are weaknesses and gaps that require further exploration before advancing quercetin as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease:

• While the molecular mechanisms of quercetin in inhibiting MLCK and preserving tight junction integrity are supported by preclinical data, direct evidence in the context of gliadin or gluten-induced barrier dysfunction is limited. Most available studies have focused primarily on IL-1β-induced inflammatory models rather than on gliadin-specific challenges, which leaves a gap in the translational model for celiac disease (Chayalak et al., 2024; Calabriso et al., 2022).
• Although there are promising data suggesting quercetin’s role in attenuating ER stress in other cellular contexts, direct measurements of ER stress markers such as CHOP/DDIT3 in gliadin-challenged enterocytes or organoids have not been robustly documented. This represents an important mechanistic gap since ER stress is a key mediator of cell dysfunction in celiac disease (Eisvand et al., 2022).
• Clinical trials specifically targeting celiac disease with quercetin are currently absent, as indicated by searches on clinical trial registries. This means that while preclinical data are compelling, a significant translational step remains before quercetin can be validated as a therapy for celiac disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
• The multifactorial nature of celiac disease, which involves immune dysregulation, genetic predisposition (e.g., HLA-DQ2/DQ8), and complex interactions between dietary gluten and gut microbiota, may not be fully addressed by quercetin alone. It is likely that quercetin would need to be evaluated as an adjunctive therapy rather than as a stand-alone treatment (Calabriso et al., 2022; Van Buiten & Elias, 2021).
• Dose-dependent effects, including potential cytotoxicity at higher concentrations, have been documented in vitro. Careful dose optimization is required to ensure that quercetin is both effective and safe in a clinical setting (Chayalak et al., 2024; Deachapunya & Chayalak, 2023).

In conclusion, quercetin exhibits strong potential as a therapeutic candidate for the prevention of gliadin-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction in celiac disease. Its natural origin, favorable safety profile, and multifaceted mechanism of action—particularly its capacity to inhibit MLCK, mitigate inflammatory signaling, and potentially reduce ER stress—render it an attractive candidate for repurposing. Nevertheless, there remains a need for further targeted studies, particularly those that evaluate quercetin’s effects directly in gliadin-exposed intestinal epithelial models and in relevant animal or clinical settings. The gaps in evidence related to direct modulation of ER stress markers such as CHOP/DDIT3 and the lack of clinical trial data underscore the necessity of additional preclinical research. These studies should aim to optimize dosing, assess long-term effects, and establish robust mechanistic links specific to the pathophysiological features of celiac disease. Given the promising preclinical data, quercetin should be considered for further investigation as a potential adjuvant therapy for celiac disease, with the ultimate goal of preserving intestinal barrier integrity and mitigating disease progression (Calabriso et al., 2022; Chayalak et al., 2024; Deachapunya & Chayalak, 2023).
