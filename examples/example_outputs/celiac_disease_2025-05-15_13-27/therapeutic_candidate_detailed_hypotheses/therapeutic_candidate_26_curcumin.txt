Proposal for Curcumin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Curcumin is a bioactive polyphenolic compound most commonly extracted from turmeric (Curcuma longa), a spice with a long historical usage in traditional medicine, particularly within Ayurvedic practices. It was first isolated as a yellow pigment from turmeric rhizomes and later characterized as 1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione (also known as diferuloylmethane) (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 1–3). Belonging to the polyphenol and flavonoid family, curcumin has been historically used for its presumed anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities. This class of compounds has seen extensive investigation not only in preclinical biochemical assays but also as dietary supplements and even as adjunctive therapy in clinical interventions for various diseases. Curcumin’s natural origin and its historical use as a spice and a traditional remedy offer a compelling basis for drug repurposing initiatives because its safety profile is well established and it has been incorporated into numerous oral formulations (Natalucci et al., 2021, pp. 11–12; Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 3–4).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of curcumin spans several decades and includes its investigation in multiple inflammatory, metabolic, and neoplastic conditions. Biochemically, curcumin has been shown to attenuate inflammatory cytokine production, reduce oxidative stress, and modulate intracellular signaling pathways associated with chronic inflammation. Clinical studies have explored its efficacy in conditions such as ulcerative colitis, cancer adjunct therapies, arthritis, and metabolic syndrome. Although it has been extensively studied in preclinical models—in which it has been demonstrated to restore epithelial barrier function via modulation of intracellular signaling—it has not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials specifically targeting celiac disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In related gastrointestinal disorders, such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity and inflammatory bowel diseases, there are promising data on the use of polyphenols including curcumin; for example, in co-culture models and animal studies, curcumin has been reported to limit gliadin-induced inflammatory responses and restore tight junction integrity (Calabriso et al., 2022, pp. 15–17; Calabriso et al., 2022, pp. 14–15). Moreover, its use in ulcerative colitis—in which its combination with standard therapy produced superior results to standard therapy alone—suggests that the immunomodulatory and barrier-protective properties of curcumin have translational potential in many gut inflammatory conditions (Calabriso et al., 2022, pp. 14–15; Natalucci et al., 2021, pp. 28–30).

Mechanism of Action:
From a molecular standpoint, curcumin’s mechanism of action is multifaceted. One major mechanism is its potent inhibition of the Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. Activation of the NF-κB pathway is a well-known driver of inflammatory responses; upon activation, NF-κB translocates into the nucleus where it promotes the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukins (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6), and adhesion molecules (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 11–12; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 15–16). By inhibiting IκB kinase (IKK) phosphorylation, curcumin prevents IκB degradation, thereby blocking NF-κB nuclear translocation and subsequent gene transcription. This results in a downregulation of inflammation-related gene expression and attenuation of inflammatory cascades. Curcumin has also been reported to inhibit Protein Kinase C (PKC), particularly affecting the PKC isoforms involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and tight junction integrity (Unknown Reference; Panwar et al., 2021, pp. 11–12). In the context of enterocytes, PKC plays an important role in mediating actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in response to inflammatory stimuli such as gliadin peptides. Gliadin has been shown to trigger zonulin release—a modulator of tight junction (TJ) integrity—via PKC-dependent pathways, resulting in disassembly of tight junction complexes including proteins such as occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) (Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 8–9; Cilla et al., 2015, pp. 1–4). Curcumin’s inhibition of PKC activity can thus prevent such downstream effects. Additionally, curcumin has been observed to increase the expression and proper localization of TJ proteins in intestinal epithelial cells (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 4–6; Wang et al., 2017, pp. 23–33). Its ability to restore the assembly and function of these junctional proteins is critical for maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. Furthermore, curcumin is known to act as an antioxidant by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and upregulating cellular antioxidant defenses, which contributes to the stabilization of the cell membrane and TJ complexes. Together, these mechanisms—NF-κB inhibition, PKC modulation, and antioxidant effects—explain how curcumin can counteract gliadin-induced zonulin release, thwart actin cytoskeletal disruption, and preserve or even restore the expression of occludin and ZO-1 (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 7–9; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 8–9).

Expected Effect:
Given the hypothesis that curcumin will modulate PKC and NF-κB pathways in enterocytes, the expected result in in vitro assays (for example, in gluten-challenge Caco-2 cell models or organoid systems) is a notable reduction in gliadin-induced zonulin secretion and improved epithelial barrier function. Specifically, curcumin is anticipated to reduce the inflammatory response triggered by gliadin, thereby inhibiting the downstream release of zonulin—a key mediator that disrupts tight junction complexes. By curtailing zonulin release, curcumin should prevent the disassembly of the tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1. Evidence from several studies suggests that in models of intestinal permeability, administration of curcumin leads to an upregulation of TJ proteins and attenuation of paracellular leakage (Leech et al., 2019, pp. 9–10; Wang et al., 2017, pp. 14–18). Moreover, by inhibiting NF-κB activation, curcumin can decrease the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, which are known to further disrupt TJ integrity through phosphorylation cascades and cytoskeletal rearrangement (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 9–10; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 15–16). In turn, this cascade leads to a reduction in epithelial permeability and restores a healthier barrier function. In addition, since PKC signaling contributes to actin rearrangement that destabilizes junctional complexes, its inhibition by curcumin is expected to prevent the cytoskeletal alterations associated with gliadin exposure (Panwar et al., 2021, pp. 11–12; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 8–9). Together, these effects should be measurable by a decrease in trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) loss and an improvement in barrier function markers in the cell culture models. The expression levels of occludin and ZO-1 can be assessed via immunocytochemistry or Western blot analysis to determine the restorative impact of curcumin on tight junction assembly (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 4–6; Wang et al., 2017, pp. 23–33).

Overall Evaluation:
There is compelling scientific rationale for considering curcumin as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease based on its molecular activities and extensive safety history. One of the biggest strengths of curcumin is its well-documented safety profile; decades of usage as a dietary supplement in humans across various populations underscore its tolerability and potential for long-term use (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 1–3; Natalucci et al., 2021, pp. 11–12). Moreover, its ability to target multiple inflammatory pathways simultaneously is highly advantageous in a multifactorial disorder such as celiac disease, which is characterized by aberrant immune responses to gluten as well as disruption of intestinal barrier function. The dual action on NF-κB and PKC pathways offers a mechanistic basis for dampening the inflammatory milieu triggered by gliadin peptides while preserving or restoring tight junction proteins such as occludin and ZO-1 (Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 15–16; Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 4–6).

Nevertheless, there are significant challenges and weaknesses that need to be acknowledged. One of the primary concerns is the notoriously poor oral bioavailability of curcumin due to its low aqueous solubility and rapid first-pass metabolism. This pharmacokinetic limitation has often dampened enthusiasm in translating preclinical efficacy to clinical outcomes, despite numerous formulation strategies being developed to address this issue—from nanoparticle encapsulation to phytosomal formulations (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 3–4; Natalucci et al., 2021, pp. 28–30). Additionally, while preclinical models provide a robust foundation for its use in gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions, there is currently no direct clinical trial evidence that curcumin alone can ameliorate celiac disease symptoms (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This lack of specific clinical evidence particularly in celiac cohorts means that while the mechanistic hypothesis is strong, translation into clinical benefit remains to be confirmed. Furthermore, like many naturally derived compounds, curcumin may have batch-to-batch variability and potential issues with standardization that could complicate its development as a consistent and reliable pharmaceutical agent.

From a mechanistic perspective, curcumin’s ability to modulate NF-κB activation is well supported in the literature. It prevents the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB, thereby reducing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and subsequent transcription of pro-inflammatory genes (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 11–12; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 15–16). Simultaneously, curcumin’s modulation of PKC signaling is important for maintaining cytoskeletal stability and tight junction integrity, particularly under conditions of gliadin-induced stress (Panwar et al., 2021, pp. 11–12; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 8–9). These actions collectively contribute to its capacity to reduce zonulin release and restore the adhesive properties of tight junction proteins, thereby maintaining or re-establishing the intestinal barrier—a critical need in celiac disease pathology. The preclinical data from various in vitro models, including Caco-2 cell lines and organoid systems, provide supportive evidence that curcumin can impact epithelial barrier function by improving the expression and organization of occludin and ZO-1 (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 4–6; Wang et al., 2017, pp. 23–33).

In summary, curcumin exhibits several strengths that merit further evaluation as an adjunctive therapy for celiac disease. Its extensive history of safe use, its documented multi-targeted anti-inflammatory effects, and its ability to improve intestinal barrier function all support the scientific premise of the candidate. However, its clinical efficacy in celiac disease remains unproven due to the absence of direct clinical trial data, and challenges concerning its bioavailability must be overcome if true therapeutic benefits are to be realized. Consequently, while the preclinical data are promising and align well with the hypothesis that curcumin can modulate PKC and NF-κB pathways, suppress gliadin-induced zonulin release, and restore tight junction integrity, further targeted research—including formulation improvements and controlled clinical trials in celiac disease patient populations—is necessary before curcumin can be definitively recommended as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease (Calabriso et al., 2022, pp. 15–17; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall, our evaluation suggests that curcumin should remain under consideration as a promising repurposed drug for celiac disease with respect to its molecular mechanisms, although additional data will be required to overcome its pharmacokinetic drawbacks and to validate its efficacy in a clinical setting specific to celiac disease. The strategic next steps would include further in vitro studies in gluten-challenge models, optimization of curcumin formulations to enhance intestinal bioavailability, and eventually early-phase clinical trials designed specifically for patients with celiac disease. Such a systematic and stepwise approach will be critical to determine whether curcumin’s promising mechanistic profile can be translated into meaningful clinical benefits for celiac patients (Ghosh et al., 2018, pp. 7–9; Leech et al., 2019, pp. 9–10; Catalioto et al., 2011, pp. 20–22).
