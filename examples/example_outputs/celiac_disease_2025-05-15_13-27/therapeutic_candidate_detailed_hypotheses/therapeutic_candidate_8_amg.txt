Proposal for AMG 714 (anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibody)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
AMG 714 (also known as PRV-015) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that has been developed to specifically target interleukin-15 (IL-15), a pro‐inflammatory cytokine implicated in the immunopathology of celiac disease. This therapeutic candidate is produced through recombinant DNA technology by engineering a chimeric antibody that has been further “humanized” to reduce immunogenicity in patients, placing it in the class of biologic immunomodulators. Monoclonal antibodies have been used extensively to target cytokines or cell surface antigens in a wide range of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, and AMG 714 capitalizes on this well‐established therapeutic paradigm. The natural basis for this candidate lies in the recognition that IL-15 drives a cascade of immune activation within the intestinal mucosa; hence, inhibiting IL-15 with a targeted antibody is hypothesized to modulate this pathway. This class of compounds, anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies, has demonstrated efficacy in diverse diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease by neutralizing pivotal cytokines that orchestrate chronic inflammation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ochoa et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
AMG 714 has undergone extensive preclinical and early clinical evaluation in the context of celiac disease and other IL-15–driven conditions. In clinical trials performed on adult patients with celiac disease—specifically in studies such as NCT02633020 and NCT02637141—the antibody was investigated for its capacity to reduce intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) activation and mucosal inflammation induced by gluten challenge (Amgen, 2016a, 2016b). These studies have shown evidence of target engagement, particularly a reduction in aberrant IEL density at higher doses, although the primary histological endpoint, measured by the villous height-to-crypt depth (VH:CD) ratio, was not significantly improved relative to placebo (Lähdeaho et al., 2019; Amgen, 2016b). Furthermore, AMG 714 is being evaluated in non-responsive celiac disease in a Phase 2b trial (NCT04424927) where its capacity to ameliorate patient-reported symptoms and modulate immune cell activation is under active investigation (Provention Bio, 2020). Prior to these studies in celiac disease, anti-IL-15 antibodies have also been studied in preclinical models of gluten-sensitive conditions as well as in other autoimmune indications, thereby lending support to IL-15 blockade as a therapeutic concept (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Unknown Reference).

Mechanism of Action:
IL-15 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is overexpressed in the intestinal mucosa of patients with celiac disease and plays a critical role in driving the activation, proliferation, and cytotoxic function of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). Normally, IL-15 signals through its high-affinity receptor complex that consists of a unique IL-15Rα subunit together with the IL-2/15 receptor β chain and the common γ chain, thereby triggering downstream signaling via the Janus kinase (JAK) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) pathways. This cytokine-mediated activation leads to enhanced expression of cytotoxic receptors such as NKG2D on IELs, and it lowers their threshold for activation such that they can kill stressed epithelial cells even in the absence of specific antigen recognition (Abadie & Jabri, 2014). AMG 714 functions by specifically binding to IL-15, thereby preventing its interaction with the IL-15 receptor complex. This blockade inhibits the downstream pro-inflammatory pathways including the activation of NK and CD8+ T cells that are ultimately responsible for the release of cytotoxic mediators like TNF-α and IFN-γ. In doing so, AMG 714 is expected to reduce the abnormal cytotoxicity of IELs, stabilize the expression of tight junction proteins, and ultimately prevent epithelial apoptosis under gluten challenge conditions (Abadie & Jabri, 2014; Ochoa et al., 2023). The antibody’s high specificity for IL-15 avoids the broader immune suppression seen with less selective immunosuppressive agents, providing a mechanistic rationale for improved clinical outcomes with a favorable safety profile (Meghnem et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for using AMG 714 in celiac disease rests on the expectation that neutralizing IL-15 in the lamina propria will interfere with the key pathogenic cascade leading to intestinal mucosal damage. Under gluten exposure, elevated IL-15 levels result in the activation and expansion of IELs, which in turn mediate epithelial cell apoptosis and the degradation of tight junction integrity. By blocking IL-15, AMG 714 is expected to reduce the release of inflammatory mediators (such as TNF-α and IFN-γ), lower MLCK (myosin light chain kinase) upregulation, and decrease IEL cytotoxicity, thus contributing to the stabilization of the epithelial barrier. In clinical assays, this mechanism should manifest as a reduction in aberrant IEL density within the mucosa, improvement or maintenance of the VH:CD ratio, and an amelioration of gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea. Histological assessments and patient-reported outcome measures from trials like NCT02637141 provide initial evidence that higher doses of AMG 714 are associated with reduced intraepithelial lymphocyte counts, suggesting that the anticipated molecular effects are indeed achievable in vivo (Lähdeaho et al., 2019; Unknown Reference). Furthermore, IL-15 is known to be expressed abundantly by intestinal epithelial cells and antigen-presenting cells in active celiac disease, supporting the rationale that AMG 714’s mechanism of action is well targeted to the disease-relevant cell types (Abadie & Jabri, 2014; De Nitto et al., 2009).

Overall Evaluation:
AMG 714 represents a promising translational candidate for addressing key pathogenic mechanisms in celiac disease by directly targeting IL-15, a central mediator of IEL activation and epithelial barrier disruption. The strengths of this therapeutic candidate lie in its high specificity for IL-15, as evidenced by its mechanism of neutralizing cytokine activity and reducing aberrant IEL activation observed in early-phase clinical studies. Its capacity to mitigate inflammatory cascades, when coupled with preliminary safety data reported in Phase 2 trials (such as NCT02633020 and NCT02637141), strongly supports the potential of AMG 714 to offer clinical benefits for patients who continue to experience mucosal damage despite adherence to a gluten-free diet (Amgen, 2016a, 2016b; Lähdeaho et al., 2019).

However, several weaknesses and challenges must also be acknowledged. First, while reductions in IEL density have been observed, the primary histopathological endpoint—the improvement in the villous height-to-crypt depth ratio—has not been significantly improved in some trials. This raises questions regarding whether IL-15 blockade alone is sufficient to reverse the complex tissue remodeling that occurs under conditions of gluten challenge (Lähdeaho et al., 2019; Scalvini et al., 2025). Second, given the multifactorial nature of celiac disease, which involves intricate interactions between genetic predisposition, gluten exposure, and complex immune responses, AMG 714 may need to be used in combination with other therapies to achieve full mucosal healing and restoration of barrier integrity (Abadie & Jabri, 2014; Unknown Reference). Third, while the safety profile appears acceptable, the potential for immunogenicity, the high cost associated with monoclonal antibody therapies, and the need for repeated dosing are significant limitations that must be balanced against the anticipated clinical benefits (Lähdeaho et al., 2019; Pan et al., 2015). Moreover, although AMG 714’s inhibition of IL-15 is expected to reduce IEL cytotoxicity and restore tight junction integrity, direct measurements of these downstream effects on tight junction proteins and overall barrier function remain to be clearly established in clinical settings (Abadie & Jabri, 2014; Unknown Reference).

In summary, AMG 714 exhibits a strong mechanistic rationale for treating celiac disease through selective IL-15 neutralization, a strategy supported by both biochemical insights and clinical proof-of-concept studies. Targeting IL-15 not only addresses the immune dysregulation that underlies IEL-driven epithelial damage, but it also represents a precision medicine approach that circumvents the broader immunosuppression associated with traditional therapies. The preclinical and early-phase clinical data indicate that AMG 714 can attenuate key immunopathological markers such as aberrant IEL activation, and thereby may stabilize or improve intestinal barrier integrity under gluten challenge conditions (Abadie & Jabri, 2014; Lähdeaho et al., 2019).

Nonetheless, further large-scale Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies with longer treatment durations, combination strategies, and more sensitive measures of intestinal barrier restoration are warranted to definitively establish clinical efficacy. Particular attention should be focused on evaluating whether AMG 714 can achieve robust histological improvement beyond symptom modulation, as the data to date suggest that while target engagement is achieved, the effects on primary morphological endpoints are modest. Additionally, possible combination regimens that may include agents directed at other inflammatory mediators or barrier-enhancing strategies should be considered to address the multifaceted nature of celiac disease pathogenesis (Unknown Reference; Scalvini et al., 2025).

Overall, the strengths of AMG 714 include its targeted mechanism of action, clinical evidence of reducing IEL-mediated inflammation, and its potential to address an unmet therapeutic need in non-responsive celiac disease. Its weaknesses, primarily the modest impact on endpoint histological measures and logistical challenges related to monoclonal antibody therapies, require further investigation. The current body of evidence warrants continued clinical development and further mechanistic studies, making AMG 714 a compelling candidate for repurposing toward the treatment of celiac disease (Abadie & Jabri, 2014; Lähdeaho et al., 2019).
