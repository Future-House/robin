Proposal for Sodium butyrate

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sodium butyrate is an endogenous short‐chain fatty acid (SCFA) that is primarily produced by colonic fermentation of dietary fiber by the gut microbiota. It is a naturally occurring molecule that can be isolated and formulated as its sodium salt for pharmaceutical and nutritional applications (Baldi et al., 2021). As a member of the SCFA class, sodium butyrate belongs to a group of compounds known for their pivotal role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and barrier function. Historically, SCFAs have been recognized for their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to modulate gene expression via both epigenetic mechanisms and receptor‐mediated pathways. In particular, sodium butyrate is known to act as an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC), which alters chromatin structure and modulates transcriptional activity, and it also signals through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as GPR41 and GPR43, both of which are expressed on intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells (Liu et al., 2021). This class of compounds has been used in various experimental settings to promote epithelial barrier integrity, reduce inflammation, and even combat carcinogenesis in the colon (Feng et al., 2018). The concept behind repurposing sodium butyrate for celiac disease derives from the need to restore the broken epithelial barrier, which is a hallmark of gluten-induced injury in the small intestine, and to modulate the inflammatory environment typical of the disease (Cardoso-Silva et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
Sodium butyrate has been investigated in a number of preclinical studies across different models of gastrointestinal pathology. It was originally studied in the context of colon cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), and conditions associated with epithelial barrier dysfunction, with several studies documenting its beneficial effects on the upregulation of tight junction proteins and its anti-inflammatory properties (Bordin et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2012). Its use in animal models has consistently demonstrated improvements in epithelial barrier integrity as evidenced by increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and reduced paracellular permeability (Wu et al., 2017). Although the direct clinical application of sodium butyrate in celiac disease (CD) has not yet been extensively studied in clinical trials—a fact supported by limited clinical trial data noted in the Clinical Trials Search for “sodium butyrate AND (celiac disease OR gluten)” (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—its extensive use in other gastrointestinal disorders provides a strong foundation for its potential repurposing (Chang et al., 2019). In veterinary medicine, sodium butyrate has been used to improve gut health and enhance growth performance in livestock, further supporting its safety profile in the context of intestinal barrier restoration (Chang et al., 2019). These historical applications, particularly in conditions that share pathophysiological characteristics with celiac disease such as increased intestinal permeability and chronic inflammation, make sodium butyrate a promising candidate for repurposing in CD.

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of sodium butyrate is multifactorial and operates through both receptor-mediated and epigenetic pathways. One of the central mechanisms is its function as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, which leads to the hyperacetylation of histones and subsequent changes in gene expression profiles. This epigenetic regulation results in the upregulation of genes involved in maintaining tight junction integrity, including the transcriptional increase of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 (Bordin et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2012). The transcription factor SP1 has been shown to bind more effectively to the claudin-1 promoter when sodium butyrate is present, which directly drives the expression of key tight junction proteins (Wang et al., 2012). Concomitantly, sodium butyrate exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation, a key mediator of inflammatory responses. By doing so, it lowers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, and although data on IL-15 in this context are less abundant, the cytokine environment in celiac disease is known to include elevated IL-15, and its reduction is hypothesized as part of sodium butyrate’s beneficial effect (Liu et al., 2021). Additionally, sodium butyrate activates GPCRs such as GPR41 and GPR43, which are expressed on both intestinal epithelial cells and certain immune cell subtypes; the activation of these receptors contributes to anti-inflammatory signaling and further supports the reinforcement of the epithelial barrier (Liu et al., 2021; Musaico, 2020). Through these combined mechanisms, sodium butyrate enhances barrier function by increasing the expression and proper localization of tight junction proteins, reducing the inflammatory milieu induced by gliadin exposure, and ultimately promoting mucosal healing in the context of gluten-induced damage (Cardoso-Silva et al., 2019; Drago et al., 2006).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, the expected effect of sodium butyrate when applied in an in vitro or organoid model of gluten-challenged intestinal epithelium involves several interconnected outcomes. First, the treatment should lead to a transcriptional upregulation of tight junction proteins such as claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1, which are essential for maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. Studies have shown that butyrate can significantly increase TEER and reduce paracellular permeability in epithelial cell layers, indicating a restoration of barrier function (Wang et al., 2012; Bordin et al., 2004). Given that gliadin exposure disrupts these proteins—often through mechanisms involving zonulin release and tight junction disassembly (Drago et al., 2006)—sodium butyrate is expected to counteract these effects, thereby normalizing TEER measurements in organoid models or Caco-2 cell assays (Hollon et al., 2015). Second, sodium butyrate is anticipated to reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines, notably TNF-α and IL-15, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. By inhibiting NF-κB and other inflammatory pathways via HDAC inhibition and GPCR activation, sodium butyrate can attenuate the inflammatory response triggered by gliadin peptides (Liu et al., 2021; Musaico, 2020). Third, activation of the GPR41/GPR43 receptors by sodium butyrate contributes to cellular signaling pathways that are involved in promoting epithelial differentiation and maintaining immune homeostasis, ultimately reinforcing the barrier function (Liu et al., 2021; Musaico, 2020). In the context of a gluten challenge, such as in organoid or epithelial cell models, sodium butyrate is hypothesized to restore disrupted tight junction structures, reflected in increased expression and correct localization of claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1, while concurrently suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine production that would otherwise exacerbate epithelial damage (Cardoso-Silva et al., 2019; Drago et al., 2006). Additionally, supportive in vitro studies examining wound healing and barrier recovery indicate that butyrate can accelerate repair processes in intestinal epithelial layers, further endorsing its translational potential as a therapeutic agent in celiac disease (Ma et al., 2012).

Overall Evaluation:
Sodium butyrate emerges as a compelling therapeutic candidate for celiac disease based on its multifaceted mechanisms of action and its demonstrated efficacy in enhancing intestinal barrier integrity in various preclinical models. One of the major strengths of sodium butyrate lies in its dual mechanism of action: as an HDAC inhibitor, it modulates gene expression to upregulate critical tight junction proteins, and as a ligand for GPR41 and GPR43, it activates anti-inflammatory signaling pathways. This mechanistic synergy is particularly valuable in celiac disease, where both barrier dysfunction and chronic inflammation drive the pathology (Liu et al., 2021; Bordin et al., 2004). The safety profile of sodium butyrate is further reinforced by its endogenous production in the gut and its historical use in clinical and veterinary settings without major adverse effects (Chang et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Another strength is its translational potential. Sodium butyrate’s documented ability to increase TEER and reduce permeability in in vitro models closely mimics the epithelial dysfunction observed in gluten-challenged intestinal mucosa. Organotypic models, including human intestinal organoids and epithelial cell cultures like Caco-2, have been widely used to assess compounds that promote tight junction reassembly and barrier restoration, thus providing a reliable platform for future experiments with sodium butyrate (Wang et al., 2012; Musaico, 2020). Its role in reducing inflammatory cytokine production—by dampening NF-κB activation—suggests that sodium butyrate will be beneficial in mitigating the inflammatory cascade (especially TNF-α and potentially IL-15) that exacerbates mucosal damage in celiac disease (Liu et al., 2021; Drago et al., 2006).

However, some challenges and weaknesses must also be considered. There is currently a relative paucity of direct clinical or organoid-based data specifically evaluating sodium butyrate in the context of celiac disease. Most of the evidence stems from studies in other inflammatory or intestinal barrier dysfunction models, and while the mechanistic rationale is robust, direct translation into celiac disease therapeutics requires further investigation. Moreover, while sodium butyrate is well tolerated, its pharmacokinetics and bioavailability when administered orally, particularly in the upper small intestine (the primary site of gluten-induced injury in celiac disease), might differ from those in the colon where it is endogenously produced (Baldi et al., 2021; Musaico, 2020). It will also be critical to determine the optimal dosing regimen that achieves therapeutic concentrations in the target tissues without adverse effects. Additionally, while receptor-mediated signaling through GPR41/GPR43 and HDAC inhibition are well documented in other contexts, the interplay of these pathways specifically in gluten-challenged epithelia remains to be thoroughly delineated (Liu et al., 2021; Bordin et al., 2004).

Furthermore, the inflammatory milieu in celiac disease is complex and involves adaptive immune responses to gluten peptides in genetically predisposed individuals. Although sodium butyrate’s anti-inflammatory effects are promising, it remains to be seen whether these effects are sufficient on their own to alter the course of the disease or whether they would need to be used in conjunction with dietary management (i.e., a gluten-free diet) or other immunomodulatory therapies (Drago et al., 2006; Hollon et al., 2015). Finally, long-term studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of sodium butyrate in human subjects with celiac disease are needed to establish its clinical utility.

In summary, sodium butyrate is a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease given its endogenous nature, established safety profile, and dual mechanisms of action via HDAC inhibition and GPCR-mediated anti-inflammatory signaling. The compound’s ability to upregulate tight junction proteins such as claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1, along with its potential to reduce inflammatory cytokine release (notably TNF-α and possibly IL-15), may restore epithelial barrier function in gluten-challenged intestinal tissues. Although further direct testing in celiac disease models—including organoid studies and gluten challenge assays—is necessary, the current body of biochemical and preclinical evidence supports the potential of sodium butyrate as a novel therapeutic option. Its success would complement traditional gluten-free dietary approaches and may offer additional benefits in terms of mucosal healing and inflammatory control, thereby improving patient outcomes in celiac disease (Cardoso-Silva et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2012; Musaico, 2020). Overall, while some uncertainties remain regarding optimal delivery and efficacy in the specific context of celiac disease, sodium butyrate’s multifaceted mechanism and safety profile make it a strong candidate for further translational and clinical evaluation.
