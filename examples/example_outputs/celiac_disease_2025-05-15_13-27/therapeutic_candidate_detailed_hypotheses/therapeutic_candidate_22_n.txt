Proposal for N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) as a promising repurposed drug candidate for celiac disease, based solely on the available literature and context provided.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is a small, thiol‐containing molecule synthesized by acetylating the naturally occurring amino acid L-cysteine, which both enhances its water solubility and protects it from oxidation (Samuni et al., 2013). This modified cysteine derivative serves as an exogenous source of cysteine for intracellular glutathione (GSH) synthesis, lending NAC a central role as an antioxidant. NAC falls into the general class of antioxidant compounds that have been extensively used in clinical practice as mucolytics, as well as in the treatment of acetaminophen overdose—where replenishment of depleted GSH is critical for detoxification. Over several decades, the chemical synthesis and development of NAC have been thoroughly investigated, allowing its wide clinical adoption and providing a robust pharmacological safety profile (Samuni et al., 2013). Its twofold mechanism—directly scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and indirectly maintaining the intracellular redox balance by restoring GSH—is central to its therapeutic appeal. In addition to its current use in respiratory diseases and overdose scenarios, NAC’s biochemical properties have prompted investigation into its utility in various oxidative stress–related pathologies, including those involving barrier dysfunction in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

Therapeutic History:
NAC’s clinical history is extensive and multifaceted. Initially, it gained prominence as the treatment of choice in acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose, where it effectively replenishes intracellular GSH stores to counteract the toxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine. Its potent mucolytic properties also led to its use in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other lung conditions. Over time, NAC has been explored in a wide array of preclinical and clinical settings for disorders characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation. In animal models of surgical stress, NAC pre‐treatment has been shown to protect intestinal mitochondria, thereby mitigating barrier dysfunction typically induced by surgical manipulation; for instance, in a rat model, NAC improved mitochondrial functionality in intestinal tissues under stress conditions (Heidari et al., 2020). Similarly, in experimental colitis models and inflammatory bowel conditions, NAC has been observed to reduce oxidative damage and inflammatory cytokine release while preserving or restoring tight junction integrity in the intestinal epithelium (Tenório et al., 2021). Although direct use of NAC in celiac disease has not been established in clinical trial databases—as indicated by searches returning no relevant studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—the scientific literature from related gastrointestinal barrier dysfunction conditions supports further evaluation of NAC in this context. Additionally, preclinical studies have demonstrated that NAC can attenuate oxidative stress in various cell types and animal models, including scenarios where epithelial cell apoptosis and tight junction disruptions occur, suggesting its potential applicability in diseases like celiac disease where gliadin peptides induce oxidative injury (Andrade et al., 2015; Lee & Kang, 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, NAC works through several interrelated mechanisms that collectively support its protective effects on cellular homeostasis. First, NAC acts as a direct scavenger of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Its free sulfhydryl (–SH) group is highly reactive, enabling it to neutralize potent oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals, nitrogen dioxide, and thiyl radicals, which otherwise may damage lipids, proteins, and DNA (Samuni et al., 2013). This capacity for radical scavenging helps reduce the overall oxidative burden within cells. Second, NAC is critically important as a precursor for glutathione synthesis. Glutathione, a tripeptide composed of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine, is one of the most important intracellular antioxidants. By providing cysteine—the rate‐limiting amino acid in GSH synthesis—NAC facilitates rapid replenishment of intracellular GSH pools, especially under conditions where oxidative stress is high and endogenous stores are depleted (Andrade et al., 2015).

In many cellular contexts, particularly in the intestinal epithelium, oxidative stress not only leads to direct macromolecular damage but also activates redox-sensitive signaling pathways. For example, heightened ROS production results in the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), both of which play pivotal roles in modulating the phosphorylation status of tight junction proteins, such as occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) (Lee & Kang, 2019). When these kinases become activated, they can disrupt the structure and function of the tight junction complex, leading to increased paracellular permeability. By reducing ROS levels through both direct scavenging and GSH replenishment, NAC can attenuate the aberrant activation of PKC and MLCK. Thus, NAC indirectly helps preserve tight junction integrity and maintains the barrier function of intestinal epithelial cells.

Furthermore, NAC has been shown to exert anti-apoptotic effects. In cell models challenged with inflammatory stimuli (e.g., LPS), NAC treatment results in a significant reduction in the activation of caspase-3, a key executor of apoptosis. For example, studies in both intestinal epithelial cell models and animal models of surgical stress indicate that NAC reduces apoptosis, thereby preserving the viability of enterocytes and contributing to an intact barrier (Gao et al., 2025; Heidari et al., 2020). These multifactorial actions—including radical scavenging, boosting glutathione synthesis, modulation of redox-sensitive kinases, and reduction of apoptosis—underline the potential for NAC to stabilize and protect epithelial integrity under oxidative conditions.

In addition to directly influencing tight junction proteins, NAC’s impact on mitochondrial function is crucial. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a well-known contributor to cellular injury, particularly in stressed tissues. NAC has been observed to protect mitochondrial integrity, thus ensuring that energy production remains sufficient for the maintenance of cellular processes essential for barrier function. This is of particular interest in the context of enterocyte health, where compromised mitochondrial function may exacerbate barrier dysfunction (Heidari et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In celiac disease, ingestion of gluten-containing grains leads to an immune-mediated cascade in which gliadin peptides trigger the release of cytokines and generate significant amounts of ROS. This oxidative stress is implicated in the disruption of tight junction integrity and subsequent barrier dysfunction, which not only allows luminal antigens to access the immune system but also amplifies the inflammatory response. The hypothesis driving the repurposing of NAC in celiac disease is thus multifold:

1. Replenishment of Glutathione Pools: By providing cysteine, NAC is expected to replenish intracellular glutathione stores, thereby boosting the cellular antioxidant capacity. This is particularly relevant in gliadin-exposed epithelial cells, where oxidative stress depletes GSH levels and compromises cellular defenses (Andrade et al., 2015).

2. Scavenging of Reactive Oxygen Species: The free radical scavenging action of NAC should directly lower ROS levels generated as a result of gliadin-induced immune activation and cytokine signaling. By neutralizing these reactive species, NAC would reduce the oxidative damage inflicted upon the proteins that form tight junctions, such as occludin and ZO-1 (Lee & Kang, 2019).

3. Inhibition of Redox-Sensitive Kinases: Through its antioxidative action, NAC is expected to prevent the inappropriate activation of redox-sensitive kinases such as PKC and MLCK, which are known to phosphorylate tight junction components, leading to their dysfunction and internalization. Prevention of such phosphorylation events would help maintain the structural integrity and function of the tight junction complex (Tenório et al., 2021).

4. Preservation of Mitochondrial and Cellular Integrity: NAC’s ability to protect mitochondrial function and reduce apoptosis is also anticipated to play a key role. By reducing caspase-3 activation and preventing enterocyte apoptosis, NAC should contribute to preserving the overall integrity of the intestinal epithelium, thereby limiting the breakdown of the barrier that is a hallmark of celiac pathology (Gao et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2021).

Studies using models of intestinal injury – such as LPS-induced dysfunction in pig intestinal epithelial cells – have demonstrated that NAC can significantly reduce permeability and restore transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), alongside restoring the expression of key tight junction proteins (Lee & Kang, 2019). Such effects in vitro strongly suggest that, when applied to a gliadin challenge in models that mimic celiac disease (e.g., gliadin-exposed Caco-2 or organoid culture systems), NAC should similarly reduce oxidative stress, maintain tight junction integrity, and ultimately help preserve the mucosal barrier. This would theoretically prevent the leakiness of the gut barrier and the downstream exaggerated immune responses that contribute to the pathology of celiac disease (Tenório et al., 2021).

Moreover, by restoring the intracellular redox balance and preventing tight junction protein oxidative modification, NAC could contribute to reducing the chronic inflammation that underlies the mucosal damage seen in celiac patients. Such a reduction in epithelial permeability is crucial because elevated intestinal permeability is considered a predisposing factor not only for the initiation of the immune response in celiac disease but also for its persistence even after the onset of the disease.

Overall, when integrated into in vitro assays and animal models that recapitulate the oxidative and inflammatory stress conditions observed in celiac disease, NAC is expected to demonstrate its multifaceted mechanism: attenuating gliadin-induced ROS generation, maintaining or restoring the expression of occludin, ZO-1, and associated junctional proteins, and safeguarding mitochondrial function to preserve cell viability and barrier function. In this manner, NAC would operate at both the molecular and tissue levels to counteract the deleterious effects of oxidative injury as well as inflammatory signaling activated by gliadin peptides.

Overall Evaluation:
N-Acetylcysteine is a highly attractive candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic for celiac disease. One of its major strengths is its well-documented safety and clinical tolerability; its broad use in treating acetaminophen overdose and as a mucolytic agent attests to this established safety profile. Its dual mechanism of action—serving both as a direct antioxidant by scavenging ROS and indirectly by replenishing intracellular glutathione—addresses the central pathophysiological process implicated in celiac disease, namely, oxidative stress–induced barrier dysfunction (Samuni et al., 2013; Andrade et al., 2015).

Preclinical studies in models of gastrointestinal injury provide compelling evidence that NAC can improve mitochondrial function, diminish apoptosis in epithelial cells, reduce inflammatory cytokine production, and restore the expression of tight junction proteins; for example, improvements in intestinal barrier integrity following surgical or LPS-induced stress have been documented (Heidari et al., 2020; Lee & Kang, 2019). Additionally, in experimental colitis models, NAC has been shown to normalize oxidative biomarkers and enhance the expression of key junctional proteins, suggesting its utility in managing enteropathies with barrier dysfunction components (Tenório et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021).

Mechanistically, NAC’s ability to modulate redox-sensitive kinases such as PKC and MLCK—thereby preventing the phosphorylation events that destabilize tight junction complexes—is particularly relevant in the context of gliadin-induced injury, where oxidative triggers disrupt the normal assembly and function of occludin and ZO-1 (Lee & Kang, 2019; Tenório et al., 2021). Moreover, its anti-apoptotic and mitochondrial protective effects further ensure that the integrity of the epithelial barrier is maintained even under conditions of inflammatory and oxidative stress.

However, certain challenges must be recognized. Firstly, the oral bioavailability of NAC is relatively low because of extensive first-pass metabolism; therefore, achieving the effective concentration in the intestinal mucosa necessary for optimal barrier protection might require modified dosing regimens or alternative routes of administration. Secondly, although numerous preclinical models demonstrate promising results, there is as yet a lack of direct clinical evidence to support the efficacy of NAC specifically in celiac disease—as indicated by clinical trial searches that do not yield studies for NAC in this context (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Thirdly, celiac disease is a complex immune-mediated disorder, and while oxidative stress is an important aspect of its pathogenesis, adaptive immune responses driven by gliadin peptides and HLA-DQ2/DQ8–restricted T cell activation are also central components; it is not yet clear how NAC’s barrier-protective and antioxidative effects will integrate with the immunologic cascade underlying celiac pathology.

Despite these concerns, the comprehensive preclinical evidence—that includes studies demonstrating NAC’s efficacy in protecting intestinal barrier integrity under various provocative conditions (e.g., surgical stress, LPS challenge, chemically induced colitis, and β-conglycinin–induced enteropathy)—provides a compelling rationale for further investigation (Gao et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2021). Its safety profile, long clinical history in other indications, and low cost make it an especially appealing candidate for rapid preclinical evaluation and, eventually, for early-phase clinical trials in celiac disease patients.

In summary, NAC demonstrates a strong mechanistic basis for repurposing in celiac disease. Its expected ability to replenish intracellular GSH, scavenge ROS, inhibit redox-sensitive kinase activation (thereby preserving tight junction protein integrity), and protect mitochondrial function directly addresses key features of oxidative injury and barrier disruption associated with celiac disease pathogenesis. While challenges such as optimal dosing and the translation of animal model outcomes to human pathology remain, the extensive preclinical data from gastrointestinal models provide a compelling framework for moving forward. Further targeted studies, including well-designed in vitro assays using gliadin-exposed human intestinal cell lines (such as Caco-2 cells) and in vivo models that more closely recapitulate the immunological milieu of celiac disease, are warranted. Ultimately, these efforts will help clarify whether NAC can effectively complement the current gluten-free dietary management by restoring epithelial barrier integrity and mitigating downstream inflammatory cascades in celiac patients (Tenório et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021).

Overall, despite some inherent limitations and the need for more direct clinical evidence in this particular disease context, NAC’s multifaceted antioxidant and barrier-protective functions, coupled with its robust safety record, strongly support its further evaluation as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease. Future research should focus on confirming its mechanistic effects on signaling pathways such as PKC and MLCK, and on defining optimal dosing strategies that ensure effective mucosal concentrations in celiac patients. Should these preclinical studies yield positive results, early-phase clinical trials can be designed to evaluate the efficacy of NAC in reducing intestinal permeability and ameliorating symptoms in celiac disease—potentially offering an adjunctive therapy to a gluten-free diet, aimed at improving quality of life in affected patients.
