Proposal for Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a naturally occurring polyphenol extracted primarily from the leaves of Camellia sinensis (green tea), and it represents one of the most abundant catechins present in this botanical source (Asri et al., 2021). EGCG belongs to the flavonoid family and, more specifically, to the subgroup of catechins that possess a distinctive galloyl moiety along with multiple hydroxyl groups that confer high reactivity and antioxidant capacity (Asri et al., 2021). The compound is isolated routinely using solvent extraction methods that retain its bioactive conformation, and its purity is maintained through chromatographic techniques making it available for both nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications (Asri et al., 2021). Historically, green tea has been used in traditional medicine for centuries because of its health-promoting attributes, including anti‐inflammatory, antimicrobial, and gut‐protective benefits; this traditional use underpins modern interest in EGCG as a therapeutic candidate for various chronic conditions (Asri et al., 2021). EGCG, therefore, falls under the category of naturally derived nutraceutical agents that have been repurposed as potential therapeutic candidates against inflammatory and barrier-disrupting diseases, including those affecting the gastrointestinal tract.

Therapeutic History
The therapeutic history of EGCG is extensive and well documented, as it has been studied in numerous preclinical models addressing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal system. In animal models of colitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), EGCG has demonstrated the capacity to attenuate mucosal inflammation, reduce polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration, and restore normal intestinal architecture, such as villus morphology and crypt depth (Van Buiten, 2017). In vitro studies employing human intestinal epithelial cell lines, such as the Caco-2 model, have reinforced these findings by showing that EGCG increases transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and decreases permeability induced by inflammatory stimuli, indicating its barrier-protective effects (Van Buiten, 2017). Additionally, polyphenol-rich extracts containing EGCG have been investigated for their potential to bind gliadin and modulate its immunogenicity in non-celiac gluten sensitivity; such studies have found that similar polyphenols can reduce cytokine release and improve barrier function (Calabriso et al., 2022). Although EGCG has not yet been directly evaluated in a clinical trial for celiac disease—there are no registered trials on ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—it has been widely used as a dietary supplement for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which supports its safe profile and potential for translational repurposing (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Overall, the accumulated therapeutic history across diverse models of gut inflammation and barrier dysfunction provides a strong rationale for considering EGCG as a candidate for modulating the pathological processes in celiac disease.

Mechanism of Action
EGCG exhibits a complex multifaceted mechanism of action that spans extracellular interactions as well as intracellular signal modulation, offering several therapeutic avenues relevant to celiac disease. One of the key mechanisms involves direct binding with gliadin peptides—the proline- and glutamine-rich fragments derived from gluten that are central to the pathogenesis of celiac disease (Van Buiten, 2017). Studies have shown that EGCG forms non-covalent complexes with these immunogenic peptides via hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, a process that relies on its unique galloyl group and hydroxylation pattern (Van Buiten, 2017). This binding induces a disorder-to-order conformational transition in the gliadin peptides, increasing their helicity and potentially masking key immunogenic epitopes that would normally be presented by HLA-DQ2/8 molecules to T cells (Van Buiten, 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2020). By precipitating gliadin into insoluble complexes, EGCG reduces its bioavailability and limits its capacity to traverse the intestinal epithelium and trigger an immune response.

Beyond this extracellular sequestration of gliadin, EGCG modulates intracellular signaling pathways that are critically involved in inflammation and barrier regulation. One of the most pivotal pathways targeted by EGCG is the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. EGCG has been shown to inhibit IκB kinase (IKK) activity, thereby preventing the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα and inhibiting the subsequent translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus (Asri et al., 2021). Since NF-κB regulates the transcription of a suite of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β, its inhibition by EGCG results in a marked reduction in the inflammatory response (Asri et al., 2021; Schnur et al., 2023). In parallel, EGCG has been observed to attenuate the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling cascade. This pathway, when activated, can lead to phosphorylation events that disrupt the assembly and function of tight junction proteins such as occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1); by inhibiting PI3K/Akt, EGCG helps maintain the proper localization and stability of these proteins (Mathews, 2022; Schnur et al., 2023).

Another intriguing facet of EGCG’s mechanism is its potential to interfere with CXCR3-mediated responses. In celiac disease, gliadin peptides have been reported to interact with the CXCR3 receptor on intestinal epithelial cells, thereby triggering zonulin release. Zonulin, in turn, modulates tight junction disassembly leading to increased gut permeability. Although definitive evidence of EGCG directly competing with gliadin for CXCR3 binding is still emerging, the hypothesis is supported by data showing that EGCG’s binding with gliadin reduces the concentration of free peptides available to engage CXCR3 (Calabriso et al., 2022; Van Buiten & Elias, 2021). This reduction in free gliadin may translate into decreased zonulin secretion, thereby stabilizing the tight junction complex and preserving barrier integrity.

EGCG also exerts an inhibitory effect on digestive enzymes such as pepsin and trypsin. In vitro studies have documented that EGCG can inhibit these proteases in a dose-dependent manner, which further contributes to a decrease in the generation of smaller, more immunostimulatory gliadin fragments (Van Buiten, 2017). The cumulative effect of these biochemical interactions—direct complexation with gliadin, inhibition of key proteases, suppression of NF-κB and PI3K/Akt signaling, and potential interference with CXCR3-mediated zonulin release—creates a therapeutic milieu that is highly pertinent to the pathological mechanisms operative in celiac disease (Asri et al., 2021; Van Buiten, 2017; Mathews, 2022).

Additionally, EGCG possesses potent antioxidant properties that enable it to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitigate oxidative stress, a factor that further contributes to the preservation of cellular structures including tight junction proteins (Ribeiro et al., 2020). The antioxidant action of EGCG not only protects epithelial cells from oxidative damage but also modulates intracellular redox-sensitive signaling pathways such as NF-κB, thereby complementing its anti-inflammatory effects (Ribeiro et al., 2020).

Expected Effect
Based on the multifactorial mechanisms described, EGCG is expected to yield several beneficial effects in experimental models of celiac disease. In an assay employing gliadin-challenged human intestinal epithelial cells or organoids, EGCG should form insoluble complexes with gliadin, substantially reducing the concentration of free, immunogenic peptides available for receptor-mediated uptake (Van Buiten, 2017). Consequently, the decreased availability of gliadin peptides should lead to a reduction in CXCR3 engagement on epithelial cells, thus lowering zonulin release and preventing tight junction disassembly (Calabriso et al., 2022). This would be observable in the form of preserved or enhanced levels of key tight junction proteins, such as occludin and ZO-1, which are central to maintaining epithelial barrier function (Mathews, 2022).

Functionally, the expected outcome in epithelial cell models should include a measurable increase in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), indicating improved barrier integrity, as well as a decrease in paracellular permeability, which can be quantified using standard assays such as FITC-dextran flux (Van Buiten, 2017). At the intracellular level, EGCG is anticipated to reduce the phosphorylation levels of Akt and IKK, correlating with decreased NF-κB activation; this would lead to a lower expression of inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β (Asri et al., 2021; Schnur et al., 2023). Collectively, these outcomes would confirm that EGCG not only structurally sequesters gliadin peptides but also biologically dampens the inflammatory cascade and prevents barrier dysfunction.

In more advanced models such as gliadin-treated intestinal organoids, EGCG is expected to result in a multifaceted protective effect. First, by physically interacting with gliadin, it would reduce the transepithelial transport of immunogenic peptides, as demonstrated by lower concentrations in the basolateral medium (Van Buiten, 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2020). Second, by inhibiting protease activity, EGCG would prevent the creation of smaller immunostimulatory fragments, further minimizing the antigenic load (Van Buiten, 2017). Third, the inhibition of NF-κB and PI3K/Akt signaling by EGCG should be evidenced by reduced phospho-Akt and phospho-IKK levels, translating into lower production of inflammatory cytokines that are typically upregulated in response to gliadin exposure (Asri et al., 2021; Schnur et al., 2023). Finally, the anticipated preservation or restoration of tight junction protein localization at cell–cell contacts would be observable using immunofluorescence imaging techniques, with occludin and ZO-1 maintaining their continuous distribution along the membrane, thereby reflecting intact barrier function (Mathews, 2022). These expected effects, taken together, strongly support the hypothesis that EGCG can ameliorate‐induced permeability and inflammation in celiac disease models.

Overall Evaluation
EGCG emerges from the literature as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease due to its dual mechanism of action that encompasses direct physicochemical sequestration as well as modulation of intracellular inflammatory and barrier-regulatory pathways. One of the primary strengths of EGCG is its ability to bind gliadin peptides through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, forming insoluble aggregates that lower the effective concentration of free immunogenic peptides available for withstanding proteolytic digestion and subsequent receptor engagement (Van Buiten, 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2020). This effect has the potential to not only blunt the early immune triggers in celiac disease but also to diminish the formation of smaller, more immunostimulatory peptide fragments produced during gastrointestinal digestion.

In addition, EGCG’s well-documented inhibitory effects on key intracellular signaling pathways—namely NF-κB and PI3K/Akt—address two critical components of celiac disease pathogenesis: inflammation and tight junction disruption (Asri et al., 2021; Mathews, 2022). The suppression of NF-κB activity results in reduced transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while PI3K/Akt inhibition prevents the pathological phosphorylation events that would otherwise compromise tight junction assembly. These actions are anticipated to synergistically maintain and restore barrier integrity, reducing paracellular leakage and ultimately preventing the translocation of gliadin peptides (Schnur et al., 2023).

Another notable advantage of EGCG is its extensive use in dietary and nutraceutical contexts. As a constituent of green tea, EGCG has been consumed safely by millions over long periods, a fact which supports its safety profile and suggests its suitability for long-term administration as an adjunct therapy for chronic conditions such as celiac disease (Asri et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Its existing preclinical efficacy in models of inflammatory bowel disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity further strengthens the argument for its repurposing given the shared pathophysiological features related to inflammation and epithelial barrier dysfunction.

Nevertheless, several challenges must be considered when evaluating EGCG as a therapeutic agent for celiac disease. A major concern is its bioavailability and stability in physiological environments. EGCG is prone to auto-oxidation and may exhibit low systemic absorption when administered orally, which could result in subtherapeutic concentrations reaching the target site unless innovative formulation strategies, such as encapsulation or nanoparticle delivery, are employed (Schnur et al., 2023). Moreover, while there is a wealth of preclinical data supporting its beneficial effects, direct clinical evidence specifically in celiac disease patients remains lacking, signifying a critical gap that future research must address (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Another potential weakness is the complexity and pleiotropic nature of EGCG’s actions. While its broad spectrum of activity is advantageous in mitigating multiple facets of celiac disease pathogenesis—from gliadin sequestration to the attenuation of inflammatory signaling—the modulation of ubiquitous pathways such as NF-κB and PI3K/Akt raises concerns regarding off-target effects. These pathways are involved in normal cellular processes including immune regulation, cell survival, and metabolism, so systemic inhibition could theoretically result in unintended adverse consequences if not carefully controlled (Asri et al., 2021). In addition, while the hypothesis that EGCG competes with gliadin for binding to CXCR3 to reduce zonulin release is appealing, direct experimental evidence to confirm this specific receptor-level interaction is presently limited (Calabriso et al., 2022; Van Buiten, 2017).

In summary, EGCG represents a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of celiac disease based on its ability to sequester gliadin peptides and modulate key signaling pathways that govern inflammation and epithelial barrier integrity. The evidence from preclinical studies—demonstrating increased TEER, preserved tight junction protein localization, reduced cytokine secretion, and effective inhibition of proteolytic digestion of gliadin—provides a robust scientific justification for further exploration of EGCG in this context (Van Buiten, 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2020; Mathews, 2022).

Moving forward, critical aspects that warrant further investigation include detailed receptor-binding assays to confirm whether EGCG directly interrupts gliadin’s interaction with CXCR3, optimization of its formulation to overcome bioavailability and stability challenges, and rigorous in vivo studies using gluten-sensitive animal models to corroborate the promising in vitro findings. Additionally, a phased clinical trial strategy starting with safety and tolerability assessments in celiac disease patients will be essential before efficacy can be fully evaluated (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall, our comprehensive literature review supports the further investigation of EGCG as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease. Its multifaceted mode of action—including gliadin complexation, NF-κB and PI3K/Akt pathway inhibition, and potential modulation of zonulin release through interference with CXCR3 binding—addresses key pathogenic mechanisms in celiac disease. The compound’s well-established safety profile as a dietary polyphenol, combined with its significant preclinical efficacy in models of gut inflammation and barrier dysfunction, makes it an attractive candidate that merits continued mechanistic studies and preclinical validation (Asri et al., 2021; Van Buiten, 2017; Calabriso et al., 2022).

In conclusion, while challenges remain regarding the translation of EGCG’s preclinical promise into clinical success—particularly issues of bioavailability, stability, and off-target effects—the detailed mechanistic insights and extensive supportive literature provide a compelling rationale for advancing EGCG into further focused studies. Enhanced formulations and targeted delivery methods may ultimately facilitate the use of EGCG as an adjunctive treatment that improves intestinal barrier function, reduces pro-inflammatory signaling, and mitigates the immunopathological cascade triggered by gliadin in celiac disease. With continued research, EGCG holds considerable promise as a novel, natural, and multi-targeted strategy to complement existing gluten-free dietary approaches and improve clinical outcomes for patients with celiac disease (Van Buiten, 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2020; Mathews, 2022).
