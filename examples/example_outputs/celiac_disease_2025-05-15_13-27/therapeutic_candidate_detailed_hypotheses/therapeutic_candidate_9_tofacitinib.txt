Proposal for Tofacitinib (JAK inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tofacitinib is a synthetic, orally bioavailable small molecule that belongs to the class of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Originally discovered and developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and subsequently approved for ulcerative colitis, tofacitinib was synthesized through medicinal chemistry approaches optimized for high selectivity for JAK family members with preferential inhibitory activity on JAK1 and JAK3, although it has measurable activity against other family kinases such as JAK2 under certain conditions (Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 28–33). As a representative of a class of compounds commonly referred to as “jakinibs,” tofacitinib exemplifies the application of targeted small-molecule inhibition to modulate intracellular cytokine signaling pathways. This drug is produced via standard organic synthesis methodologies that allow for precise modifications to the core heterocyclic structure to achieve optimal pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles (Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 1–7). JAK inhibitors have been widely used for immune modulation in several autoimmune diseases, and their oral route of administration and ability to penetrate mucosal tissues contribute to their attractiveness as therapeutic agents in immune-mediated inflammatory conditions.

Therapeutic History:
Tofacitinib has an established therapeutic history in both rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, where numerous clinical trials have verified its efficacy and safety profile (Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 1–7; Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 25–26). Beyond these mainstream indications, there is emerging anecdotal and case‐report evidence supporting its off‐label use in conditions that share underlying inflammatory pathways with celiac disease. For instance, a clinical case report documented the successful use of tofacitinib in a patient with type II refractory celiac disease, resulting in clinical remission without significant adverse events (Grewal et al., 2022, p. 1). In addition, recent literature suggests promising results for tofacitinib in a patient with both refractory celiac disease and microscopic colitis, wherein complete remission was achieved even following gluten re‐exposure (Lenfant et al., 2023, pp. 2–3). Despite these isolated reports, systematic clinical trials specifically evaluating tofacitinib for celiac disease have yet to be registered, as evidenced by a search on ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Thus, while the pre‐existing clinical experience with tofacitinib in other immune‐mediated diseases provides a strong foundation, its use in celiac disease remains investigational at this point.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, tofacitinib exerts its therapeutic effects by binding competitively to the ATP‐binding site within the catalytic domain of JAK kinases, particularly JAK1 and JAK3 (Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 28–33). This inhibition results in the blockade of downstream phosphorylation events normally triggered by cytokine receptor engagement. Cytokines such as interleukin-15 (IL-15) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which are crucial drivers of the proinflammatory cascade in celiac disease, signal through receptors that engage JAK1 and JAK3. These cytokines normally promote the phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors, particularly STAT1 and STAT3. Phosphorylated STATs dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and initiate transcription of genes that mediate inflammatory responses, including the upregulation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) (Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 25–26; Sayoc-Becerra et al., 2020, pp. 7–9). MLCK is a well‐recognized mediator of tight junction disassembly, as its enhanced activity leads to contraction of the perijunctional actomyosin ring and consequent disruption of tight junction integrity. This process results in increased intestinal permeability—a hallmark of gluten‐induced enteropathy in celiac disease. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that inhibition of STAT1/3 phosphorylation by tofacitinib can prevent cytokine-induced barrier dysfunction in intestinal epithelial cells and colonoids, suggesting that the drug can maintain tight junction organization and preserve transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) (Sayoc-Becerra et al., 2020, pp. 7–9; Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 13–16). Thus, by blunting the JAK1/3-mediated signaling cascade downstream of IL-15 and IFN-γ, tofacitinib has the potential to reduce MLCK induction and counteract the disassembly of tight junctions, thereby preserving mucosal barrier integrity.

Expected Effect:
The acting hypothesis for repurposing tofacitinib in celiac disease is that its inhibition of JAK1/3 will attenuate the aberrant cytokine signaling elicited by gluten exposure. In gliadin-exposed organoid models—which recapitulate the human intestinal epithelium—exposure to gluten typically leads to elevated levels of IL-15 and IFN-γ. These cytokines activate the JAK/STAT pathway, leading to increased phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, which in turn upregulate the expression of MLCK and other genes that contribute to tight junction disruption. The expected effect of tofacitinib would be to diminish STAT1/3 phosphorylation, thereby reducing subsequent MLCK expression and preserving the architecture and function of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 and occludin (Sayoc-Becerra et al., 2020, pp. 7–9; Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 25–26; Coskun et al., 2013, pp. 2–3). In functional assays, this should translate into maintained or restored transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and reduced paracellular permeability compared to untreated, gliadin-challenged controls (Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 13–16). Since enterocytes express the IL-15 receptor complex and IFN-γ receptors abundantly, both signaling pathways being mediated via JAK1/3 are active in these cells (Coskun et al., 2013, pp. 2–3; Sayoc-Becerra et al., 2020, pp. 7–9). Therefore, by interfering with this cytokine network, tofacitinib is expected to blunt the inflammatory cascade that leads to barrier dysfunction, thereby mitigating one of the central pathophysiological events in celiac disease. This mechanistic rationale is supported by preclinical models in inflammatory bowel disease, where restoration of barrier integrity by tofacitinib was associated with normalization of tight junction protein expression and decreased cytokine secretion (da Costa Filho et al., 2025, pp. 8–9; Spalinger et al., 2021, p. 14).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, tofacitinib presents as a promising repurposing candidate for celiac disease based on its well-characterized mechanism of action, established clinical usage in other immune-mediated diseases, and its molecular suitability for targeting cytokine-induced barrier dysfunction. Among its strengths, tofacitinib’s oral bioavailability and mucosal penetration are major advantages that provide direct access to the intestinal epithelium, where gluten-induced inflammatory processes occur (Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 1–7). Its capacity to inhibit JAK1/3—and thus block the downstream activation of STAT1 and STAT3—is highly pertinent given the pivotal roles of IL-15 and IFN-γ in driving the pathological inflammation seen in celiac disease (Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 25–26; Sayoc-Becerra et al., 2020, pp. 7–9). Moreover, early case reports suggest that tofacitinib has been used with success in refractory celiac disease contexts (Grewal et al., 2022, p. 1; Lenfant et al., 2023, pp. 2–3), further lending credence to its potential utility in this patient population. The drug’s known ADME/Tox profile, garnered from extensive clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, supports its repurposing by mitigating some of the developmental risks typically associated with novel therapeutics (Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 1–7; Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 40–41).

However, there are also noteworthy weaknesses that warrant consideration. First, while isolated case reports and anecdotal evidence are encouraging, there is an absence of formal, large-scale clinical trials or extensive preclinical studies specifically targeting celiac disease with tofacitinib; a recent search of clinical trial repositories has yielded no registered studies exclusively focused on this indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This gap underscores the need for rigorous, disease-specific preclinical evaluations—ideally using gliadin-exposed human intestinal organoid models—to validate the hypothesized effects on tight junction integrity and MLCK expression (Sayoc-Becerra et al., 2020, pp. 7–9). Additionally, the inflammatory milieu in celiac disease can be complex and is characterized by both adaptive and innate immune responses; thus, it is critical to assess whether tofacitinib’s broad immunosuppressive action might inadvertently impair mucosal immune defense mechanisms in the gut, potentially increasing the risk of infections or compromising other aspects of intestinal homeostasis (Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 10–13; Shah et al., 2023, pp. 7–8). Moreover, the potential adverse events associated with JAK inhibitors—such as increased risk for infections, herpetic reactivation, and lipid profile alterations—have already been documented in the contexts of rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, and these risks will need to be carefully balanced when considering a chronic condition like celiac disease, especially in an otherwise benign state managed mainly by a gluten-free diet (Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 1–7; Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 40–41).

From the standpoint of biochemical plausibility, the hypothesis that tofacitinib could prevent cytokine-induced tight junction disassembly by reducing STAT signaling and subsequent MLCK induction is well supported by studies in other inflammatory contexts (Sayoc-Becerra et al., 2020, pp. 7–9; Coskun et al., 2013, pp. 2–3). The colonic and small intestinal epithelial cells express receptors for both IL-15 and IFN-γ, with downstream activation of JAK1/3 being central to the signaling cascade that ultimately leads to barrier dysfunction, making this a mechanistically sound target in celiac disease. However, it is notable that much of the mechanistic evidence comes from models of inflammatory bowel disease rather than from dedicated celiac disease models. It will therefore be critically important for future research to validate that similar pathways are operative in gliadin-induced barrier dysfunction, and that tofacitinib’s inhibition of JAK1/3 produces comparable effects in this specific setting. Preclinical studies using human intestinal organoids derived from celiac disease patients would provide a robust platform to assess the impact of tofacitinib on STAT phosphorylation, MLCK expression, and the preservation of tight junction proteins like ZO-1 and occludin under gluten challenge conditions (Sayoc-Becerra et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; Yang & Xie, 2021, pp. 4–7).

In summary, the repurposing of tofacitinib for celiac disease is underpinned by a strong mechanistic rationale. Its ability to inhibit JAK1/3-mediated signaling cascades—the very pathways that lead to STAT1/3 activation and subsequent MLCK upregulation, culminating in tight junction disassembly—positions it as an attractive candidate for preserving intestinal barrier integrity in response to gluten-triggered inflammation (Schwartz et al., 2017, pp. 25–26; Coskun et al., 2013, pp. 2–3). The clinical precedent set by its use in rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, as well as promising case reports in refractory celiac disease, further bolster the case for its evaluation in this context (Grewal et al., 2022, p. 1; Lenfant et al., 2023, pp. 2–3). Nevertheless, significant challenges remain, including the need for dedicated preclinical and clinical studies to ascertain the efficacy, optimal dosing, and long-term safety of tofacitinib in the celiac disease population. Addressing these gaps will be essential in determining whether tofacitinib can be effectively repurposed to protect the gastrointestinal barrier and modulate the aberrant immune response in celiac disease. Overall, while there is a compelling scientific foundation supporting the potential of tofacitinib for repurposing in celiac disease, the current evidence base is preliminary and warrants further investigation in targeted studies before its therapeutic application in this indication can be definitively endorsed (Olivera et al., 2020, pp. 13–16; Spalinger et al., 2021, p. 14; Shah et al., 2023, pp. 4–5).
