Proposal for Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 is a live probiotic strain isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract that has been investigated as a potential live biotherapeutic for celiac disease. As a naturally occurring bacterium in the healthy gut, it exemplifies the class of probiotic microorganisms generally used to restore or modulate the gut microbiota. Its selection stems from its well‐characterized genomic repertoire—including genes potentially involved in butyrate production and mucin adhesion—and its capacity to interact with the host immune system. Probiotic candidates like this belong to a larger class of natural therapeutic compounds that have historically been used to support gut health, ameliorate dysbiosis, and modulate immune responses in gastrointestinal disorders. Previous research has focused on beneficial effects from related strains in restoring gut microbial balance in pediatric and adult populations, and the GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) status of these bacteria further supports their clinical feasibility (Olivares et al., 2014; Pellicano & Fagoonee, 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 has a documented history in both preclinical and clinical settings, primarily in its use for celiac disease, a disorder characterized by an abnormal immune response to gluten. In animal models of gliadin-induced enteropathy—mimicking aspects of celiac disease—it has demonstrated the ability to modulate pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production, restore altered intestinal morphology, and significantly alter immune cell populations (Laparra et al., 2012). In human clinical settings, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in children with newly diagnosed celiac disease who, while on a gluten-free diet, received daily supplementation of B. longum CECT 7347. The study reported beneficial outcomes in terms of improved growth parameters (e.g., greater height percentile increase), reductions in harmful bacterial groups such as Bacteroides fragilis, and modulation of immune markers such as decreased peripheral CD3+ T lymphocytes and reduced fecal secretory IgA levels (Olivares et al., 2014; Pellicano & Fagoonee, 2020). Although most of these trials focused on immune and microbiota outcomes rather than direct measures of tight junction integrity or zonulin levels, the cumulative therapeutic history provides a strong rationale that this strain can affect key components linked to celiac pathogenesis.

Mechanism of Action:
Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 exerts its effects through several interrelated molecular and cellular mechanisms. Preclinical studies have demonstrated its capacity to modulate the immune response in gliadin-induced enteropathy models. Mechanistically, it appears to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α while enhancing anti-inflammatory mediators like IL-10. This transformation in cytokine milieu is accompanied by shifts in the T-cell populations; specifically, reductions in inflammatory CD3+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes and increases in regulatory T-cell populations have been observed (Laparra et al., 2012; Pellicano & Fagoonee, 2020). In vitro studies indicate that B. longum CECT 7347 can degrade gliadin peptides, thereby reducing their immunotoxicity and potentially attenuating the stimulus for chronic inflammation (Chander et al., 2018). There is also evidence from animal investigations that this strain influences the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) signaling pathway, which is a central mediator of inflammation. Furthermore, its genome encodes putative pathways involved in the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, known to enhance intestinal barrier function by serving as an energy source for colonocytes and by reinforcing tight junction proteins. Although direct evidence on SCFA production by CECT 7347 in vivo has not been explicitly measured in human trials, related studies in similar strains from the B. longum species support this possibility (Mills et al., 2023). Additional in vitro data using epithelial cell models have shown that exposure to gliadin results in disrupted transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and mislocalization of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), a tight junction protein; treatment with B. longum CECT 7347 has been reported to partially restore TEER and normalize ZO-1 distribution, suggesting that it secretes soluble factors that act to reinforce epithelial barrier integrity (Martorell et al., 2021). These collective molecular interactions position B. longum CECT 7347 as a potential agent to restore barrier integrity by reducing gliadin-induced intestinal permeability via modulation of zonulin regulation and tight junction assembly.

Expected Effect:
Based on the mechanistic insights, the expected effect of administering B. longum CECT 7347 in patients with celiac disease is multifold. First, by modulating the gut microbiota and reducing pathogenic bacterial populations—specifically targeting increases in groups like Bacteroides fragilis—the probiotic is anticipated to reduce microbial-driven inflammatory signals, thereby indirectly contributing to improved gut barrier function (Olivares et al., 2014; Pellicano & Fagoonee, 2020). Second, increased SCFA production, whether directly by the strain or through shifts in the microbial ecosystem, would support epithelial integrity by reinforcing the assembly and function of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1. This biochemical environment is also expected to lower zonulin release—a critical modulator of tight junction permeability that is implicated in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (Rossi et al., 2023). Third, protective soluble factors or metabolites secreted by B. longum CECT 7347 may counteract the inflammatory cascade triggered by gliadin ingestion, thus attenuating gliadin-induced permeability. In preclinical models, administration of the strain has been associated with a reduction in IL-6 and TNF-α and an increase in regulatory cytokines, thereby creating an immunological milieu conducive to barrier recovery (Laparra et al., 2012; Chander et al., 2018). In cellular assays—such as those employing Caco-2 and HT-29 epithelial cells—the probiotic is expected to increase TEER, restore imbalances in zonulin expression, and enforce tight junction integrity, all of which collectively reduce gliadin-induced permeability (Martorell et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
The evaluation of B. longum CECT 7347 as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease is promising, though not without areas warranting further investigation. Strengths of this candidate include its well-documented safety profile; it is a GRAS microorganism with prior human clinical trials that have demonstrated tolerability in pediatric populations with celiac disease (Olivares et al., 2014; Pellicano & Fagoonee, 2020). Its documented immunomodulatory effects in animal models—where it attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles and reversed aspects of gliadin-induced intestinal damage—provide a strong mechanistic rationale for its use (Laparra et al., 2012). The potential to modulate the gut microbiota, reduce pathogenic bacterial overgrowth, and thereby effect improvements in the epithelial barrier offers additional therapeutic promise, particularly when considering the role of dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of celiac disease (Olivares et al., 2014; Pellicano & Fagoonee, 2020). The hypothesis that B. longum CECT 7347 may also increase SCFA production aligns with known properties of Bifidobacterium strains in general, although direct evidence in the context of celiac disease remains limited to preclinical and in vitro models (Mills et al., 2023).

Weaknesses or gaps in the current evidence include the relative paucity of direct human data specifically correlating B. longum CECT 7347 administration with measurable increases in SCFA levels, explicit reinforcement of tight junction proteins, and quantifiable reductions in zonulin levels. Although animal and in vitro studies are supportive, clinical endpoints in human trials have so far focused on immune parameters and growth metrics rather than direct molecular markers of barrier integrity (Pellicano & Fagoonee, 2020; Olivares et al., 2014). Furthermore, the heterogeneity of study designs, small sample sizes, and short intervention durations in available trials may limit the conclusiveness of the data regarding long-term effects on gut permeability and clinical symptomatology in celiac disease. It is also not entirely clear whether the pathways for butyrate (or other SCFA) production are fully active in B. longum CECT 7347 or require a synergistic microbial community that is affected by gluten-free diet adherence. Future research would need to include mechanistically oriented clinical studies that directly measure outcomes such as TEER, zonulin levels, and SCFA profiles along with clinical markers of celiac disease activity.

Overall, though, Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 exhibits significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease. Its ability to modulate the immune response, restore a healthier microbial balance, and potentially reinforce the epithelial barrier through effects on SCFA production and tight junction integrity makes it a compelling candidate for further investigation. Its established safety profile combined with promising preclinical mechanistic data recommends it for additional, well-powered clinical trials with emphasis on direct measures of intestinal permeability and barrier integrity. This integrative approach could help delineate the full therapeutic impact of B. longum CECT 7347 as an adjunctive therapy in celiac disease, especially in patients who continue to experience barrier dysfunction and low-grade inflammation despite adherence to a gluten-free diet (Chander et al., 2018; Laparra et al., 2012; Pellicano & Fagoonee, 2020).
