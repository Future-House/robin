Proposal for Spermidine

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Spermidine is an endogenous polyamine that is naturally present in all living organisms and abundantly available in certain dietary sources such as wheat germ, soybeans, and aged cheese. It is synthesized de novo from putrescine through the action of spermidine synthase and belongs to the polyamine class of small organic cations, which are essential for cellular growth, proliferation, and maintenance of homeostasis. Polyamines like spermidine have been extensively studied for their capacity to regulate autophagy—a cellular recycling process that degrades damaged proteins and organelles—in a wide array of organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. The discovery of spermidine’s autophagy-inducing properties emerged from studies on aging, where it was shown to extend lifespan in preclinical models via stimulation of autophagy and reduction of oxidative stress. This compound is typically extracted from natural sources or synthetically refined for experimental application, and its high oral bioavailability coupled with its established preclinical safety profile in aging models renders it an attractive candidate for repurposing in various disease contexts, including celiac disease (Moré & Vandenplas, 2018; Nakamura & Matsumoto, 2025).

Therapeutic History:
Spermidine and its related polyamines have a rich history of investigation in both basic biology and preclinical therapeutic studies. Experimentally, spermidine has been used to modulate autophagy and reduce inflammatory responses in various models of gastrointestinal inflammation, including dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis and T cell transfer models of colitis. Preclinical studies have documented that oral administration of spermidine ameliorates intestinal inflammation by promoting anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization and preserving barrier integrity (Niechcial et al., 2023; Truzzi et al., 2023). Although direct clinical trials in celiac disease are lacking at present, spermidine has been evaluated in healthy aging populations and in studies focused on intestinal barrier parameters, indicating its potential for broader gastrointestinal applications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In various animal models, spermidine supplementation has also been associated with improved outcomes related to proteostasis and mucosal healing, which are processes disrupted in celiac disease. Furthermore, its natural occurrence and dietary availability underscore its potential for safe long-term use, making it a strong candidate for repurposing to address intestinal epithelial dysfunction in celiac disease (Moré & Vandenplas, 2018; Nakamura & Matsumoto, 2025).

Mechanism of Action:
Spermidine’s mechanism of action is multifaceted, involving its well-documented ability to induce autophagy by modulating key regulatory proteins. At the molecular level, spermidine exerts its autophagy-inducing effects primarily through the inhibition of the acetyltransferase EP300, a negative regulator of autophagy, and through the activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), which promotes lysosomal biogenesis and sustains the autophagic process. This leads to an increase in the lipidation of LC3B, a crucial marker for autophagosome formation (Maiuri et al., 2019b; Nakamura & Matsumoto, 2025). In addition, spermidine has been shown to restore proteostasis by facilitating the clearance of damaged or misfolded proteins, thereby reducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR)—both of which are implicated in gliadin-induced cellular damage in celiac disease. On a cellular level, spermidine promotes the stabilization of crucial tight junction proteins, such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin, which are essential for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. This is particularly relevant in the context of celiac disease, where gliadin peptides are known to disrupt tight junctions and increase intestinal permeability (Orlando et al., 2017; Nakamura & Matsumoto, 2025). The compound’s interaction with autophagy machinery results in enhanced turnover of cellular components via autophagosomal and lysosomal fusion, leading to improved barrier function and reduction in inflammatory signaling cascades mediated by factors such as NF-κB. Moreover, by modulating autophagy, spermidine might indirectly influence the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2), further contributing to its anti-inflammatory effects in intestinal epithelial cells (Niechcial et al., 2020). This comprehensive molecular profile positions spermidine as a strong modulator of both proteostasis and barrier function, aligning with the pathological processes observed in celiac disease (Maiuri et al., 2019a; Nakamura & Matsumoto, 2025).

Expected Effect:
In the experimental assays proposed, particularly those involving gliadin-challenged Caco-2 cells, the expected effect of spermidine is to activate the autophagic pathway within intestinal epithelial cells. By enhancing autophagy, spermidine should boost LC3B lipidation, facilitate the clearance of gliadin-induced misfolded or aggregated proteins, and reduce markers of ER stress such as those associated with the unfolded protein response. This increase in autophagic flux is anticipated to preserve the structural organization of tight junction proteins like ZO-1 and occludin, thereby stabilizing the cellular barrier and reducing paracellular permeability—a critical parameter in celiac disease pathogenesis (Nakamura & Matsumoto, 2025; Orlando et al., 2017). The activation of autophagy will likely lead to a downstream decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine production by intestinal epithelial cells, subsequently diminishing the immune-mediated inflammatory cascade triggered by gliadin exposure. In gliadin-challenged in vitro models, one would expect to observe reduced expression of unfolded protein response markers, lower accumulation of damaged protein aggregates, and improved cell viability along with restored barrier integrity, as demonstrated by enhanced transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and reduced FITC-dextran translocation across cell monolayers. Given that proteins involved in autophagic and tight junction regulation, including EP300, TFEB, and LC3B, are expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and have been functionally validated in preclinical studies (Maiuri et al., 2019b; Nakamura & Matsumoto, 2025; Truzzi et al., 2023), spermidine is expected to demonstrate a robust cytoprotective effect in these assays. These protective effects would translate into an overall improvement in intestinal epithelial function and reduced inflammatory signaling, thereby addressing critical aspects of celiac disease pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Niechcial et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Spermidine presents a promising candidate for the treatment of celiac disease based on its established ability to induce autophagy and modulate inflammatory responses. Its natural origin, dietary availability, and excellent preclinical safety record in aging and colitis models underscore its potential for repurposing in this context. A major strength of spermidine is its dual mechanism of action: it not only enhances the autophagic clearance of damaged proteins and organelles induced by gliadin but also supports the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity by stabilizing tight junction proteins. This is crucial in celiac disease, where increased intestinal permeability and chronic inflammation are key features of the pathology. Moreover, its inhibitory effect on EP300 and the consequent activation of TFEB provides a well-defined biochemical pathway that can be directly measured and quantified in preclinical studies (Maiuri et al., 2019b; Nakamura & Matsumoto, 2025).

Nevertheless, there are certain weaknesses that must be considered. Although preclinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of spermidine in models of intestinal inflammation and colitis, there is a relative paucity of direct evidence supporting its application in celiac disease specifically. Most studies have focused on its role in general gut barrier maintenance and in inflammatory bowel disease models rather than in gluten-induced pathology. This means that while the mechanistic rationale is strong, further research specifically investigating spermidine’s effects on gliadin-challenged intestinal models and subsequent clinical trials in celiac disease patients will be necessary to fully validate its therapeutic potential. Additionally, while the autophagy induction by spermidine is well documented, the precise downstream effects on unfolded protein response markers and the stabilization of specific tight junction proteins in the context of celiac disease remain to be fully elucidated. In summary, spermidine offers a compelling therapeutic approach due to its ability to target multiple pathological processes underlying celiac disease, including autophagy impairment, ER stress, and barrier dysfunction; however, future studies must be designed to specifically address these endpoints in celiac disease models and clinical settings (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Niechcial et al., 2023; Truzzi et al., 2023).

Overall, the potential of spermidine in treating celiac disease is supported by a robust mechanistic rationale and strong preclinical evidence from related inflammatory gastrointestinal conditions, though further direct studies are necessary before it can be definitively recommended for clinical use in celiac disease.
