Proposal for ENMD-1068 (PAR2 antagonist)

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of ENMD-1068 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease based on the available literature data.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
ENMD-1068 is a synthetically derived, small-molecule antagonist that selectively targets protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), which belongs to the class of non-peptidic PAR2 modulators. The compound was discovered through structure–activity relationship studies that recapitulated features of the receptor’s endogenous tethered ligand sequence, and it has been optimized in medicinal chemistry efforts to achieve a defined inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) near 16 μM in epithelial inflammation models (Azouz et al., 2020; McIntosh et al., 2020). PAR2 antagonists have been developed over the last few decades to modulate the signaling of this G protein–coupled receptor that is widely implicated in the regulation of inflammatory processes and barrier dysfunction. In general, small-molecule antagonists in this class are synthesized by elaborating on lead structures based on proteolytic cleavage sites or mimicking the endogenous inhibitor motif, and they have been used in various experimental settings to abrogate PAR2-mediated responses in tissues such as the esophageal epithelium and intestinal mucosa (Catalioto et al., 2011; Khaleghi et al., 2016). In addition, the optimized preclinical pharmacokinetic profiles of ENMD-1068 facilitate rational dose selection in vivo, including in transgenic animal models that closely mimic human celiac disease genetics such as HLA-DQ8 mice. This candidate, therefore, represents a rationally engineered chemical entity that fits within a broader class of PAR2 antagonists developed to block receptor-mediated signaling cascades that drive inflammatory and barrier-disruptive processes.

Therapeutic History
The primary evaluation of ENMD-1068 thus far has been in preclinical systems focusing on epithelial inflammation. In earlier studies, compounds from the PAR2 antagonist class were mostly explored in contexts such as allergic inflammation and esophageal epithelial barrier dysfunction, where PAR2 signaling has been shown to mediate cellular inflammatory responses and tight junction disruption (Catalioto et al., 2011). Specifically, studies investigating epithelial inflammation models have demonstrated that small-molecule PAR2 antagonists can block receptor cleavage and attenuate downstream calcium signaling, thereby reducing cytokine release and cellular rearrangement (Azouz et al., 2020). Although many compounds from this class have faced challenges such as moderate potency and off-target effects at high concentrations, ENMD-1068 appears to be among those with a clearer pharmacokinetic profile and a defined mechanism of action that make it a candidate for repurposing. Notably, there are no registered clinical trials to date on ClinicalTrials.gov specifically evaluating ENMD-1068 or related PAR2 antagonists for celiac disease, gluten-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction, or associated conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, while other drug classes—including zonulin receptor antagonists such as larazotide acetate and enzyme therapies like latiglutenase—have been more extensively tested in clinical and translational settings for maintaining gut barrier integrity (Khaleghi et al., 2016; Machado, 2023), no direct application of ENMD-1068 has been reported in clinical or veterinary settings for celiac disease or gluten-related disorders. Thus, previous therapeutic uses of PAR2 antagonists have been limited largely to preclinical evaluations in similar barrier dysfunction models, but they provide an important proof-of-concept that targeting this receptor could help restore epithelial junction integrity during inflammatory challenges (Catalioto et al., 2011; Khaleghi et al., 2016).

Mechanism of Action
The molecular rationale for using ENMD-1068 in celiac disease hinges on the well-documented role of PAR2 in regulating intestinal epithelial barrier function. PAR2 is a G protein–coupled receptor expressed on a broad range of cell types, including intestinal epithelial cells, and is activated by proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular N-terminal domain, which unmasks a tethered ligand that in turn activates intracellular signals. In epithelial cells, PAR2 activation interfaces with the zonulin pathway–a critical modulator of tight junctions. When gluten peptides, particularly gliadin, stimulate zonulin release, zonulin binds to receptors on the epithelial cell surface (including PAR2), triggering a cascade that involves epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation (Patt et al., 2023; Valitutti & Fasano, 2019). This process activates phospholipase C (PLC) leading to calcium influx, which in turn activates protein kinase C alpha (PKCα). Activated PKCα phosphorylates tight junction proteins such as occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), leading to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and ultimately to tight junction disassembly and increased paracellular permeability. ENMD-1068 exerts its action by binding to PAR2 and preventing its protease-mediated cleavage and subsequent receptor activation. By doing so, it blocks the initial trigger for the downstream cascade involving EGFR transactivation, PLC-mediated calcium signaling, and PKCα-driven phosphorylation events necessary for junction disassembly (Azouz et al., 2020; Patt et al., 2023). At the molecular level, ENMD-1068’s specificity for PAR2 is critical because it ensures that only the pathological activation of this receptor is inhibited without broadly suppressing other signaling pathways. The presence of PAR2 on intestinal epithelial cells, confirmed in various epithelial models such as Caco-2 cell monolayers and intestinal organoids, supports the relevance of this mechanism (Ailioaie et al., 2022; Catalioto et al., 2011). Furthermore, by mitigating the actin cytoskeletal rearrangement normally seen downstream of PAR2 activation, ENMD-1068 may help preserve the distribution and function of tight junction proteins whose loss is central to the pathogenesis of celiac disease (Patt et al., 2023). Thus, at a biochemical level, this agent has been designed to interrupt a well-defined series of events starting at PAR2 activation and culminating in barrier dysfunction.

Expected Effect
The expected therapeutic effect of ENMD-1068 in the context of celiac disease revolves around its ability to prevent the gluten-induced disruption of epithelial barrier integrity in the gut. Gluten peptides, particularly those derived from gliadin, are known to stimulate zonulin release from intestinal epithelial cells. Zonulin then acts on receptors including PAR2 and triggers a cascade leading to EGFR transactivation, PLC-mediated calcium flux, and PKCα activation. This signaling cascade results in the phosphorylation and internalization of tight junction proteins such as occludin and ZO-1, ultimately causing actin cytoskeletal rearrangement and tight junction disassembly. The disruption of tight junctions increases intestinal permeability, allowing more gliadin and other luminal antigens to traverse the epithelium and activate immune responses, thereby perpetuating celiac disease pathology (Yoosuf & Makharia, 2019; Massironi et al., 2024).

Under the proposed assay conditions, such as those using established Caco-2 cell monolayers or intestinal organoid systems, ENMD-1068 is expected to preserve junctional integrity even in the presence of gluten challenge. Treated cells should exhibit reduced phosphorylation of occludin and ZO-1, less actin reorganization, and maintain a tighter barrier compared to untreated controls exposed to gliadin peptides. In vivo, when tested in HLA-DQ8 transgenic mouse models that recapitulate many of the clinical features of celiac disease, administration of ENMD-1068 is anticipated to result in a lower lactulose:mannitol excretion ratio, a surrogate marker for improved intestinal permeability, along with reduced cytokine expression and diminished inflammatory cell infiltration (Machado, 2023; Patt et al., 2023). Because epithelial cells in the gut express PAR2 along with other zonulin receptors, blocking PAR2 may not only preserve tight junction integrity but also minimize subsequent immune activation resulting from antigen translocation. This multifunctional effect is crucial because preserving the barrier limits the immune system’s exposure to luminal gluten peptides, which is a cornerstone in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. In addition, earlier data in epithelial inflammation models have shown that blocking PAR2 can reduce intracellular calcium flux and the expression of pro‐inflammatory mediators, providing further support for the expected protective effect in assays (Azouz et al., 2020; Yoosuf & Makharia, 2019).

Overall Evaluation
In summary, the evaluation of ENMD-1068 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease yields a cautiously optimistic outlook. On the strength side, ENMD-1068 is built on a robust biochemical rationale. The compound’s mechanism—antagonizing PAR2 to prevent the zonulin-mediated cascade that leads to tight junction disassembly—is directly relevant to the key pathophysiologic event of increased intestinal permeability observed in celiac disease (Patt et al., 2023; Veres-Székely et al., 2023). The scientific premise is further reinforced by numerous studies that underscore the role of PAR2 in regulating the integrity of epithelial cell junctions, particularly in gastrointestinal tissues where barrier dysfunction is a hallmark of disease (Catalioto et al., 2011; Yoosuf & Makharia, 2019).

Another strength is the defined pharmacokinetic profile of ENMD-1068, which has already been characterized in preclinical models and allows for rational dose selection in HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice—a model that closely mimics the genetic predisposition seen in human celiac disease (McIntosh et al., 2020). This preclinical data is critical because it informs the translational potential of the compound, paving the way for future clinical studies if efficacy is demonstrated in robust cellular and animal models.

The use of established in vitro models such as Caco-2 cells and intestinal organoids—both of which express PAR2 and relevant tight junction proteins—provides confidence that the downstream signaling events targeted by ENMD-1068 are indeed operational in the chosen assay systems (Ailioaie et al., 2022; Catalioto et al., 2011). These models have been instrumental in delineating the role of zonulin and PAR2 in barrier dysfunction and serve as valuable platforms for testing the drug’s protective effects against gluten-induced injury.

However, there are also several weaknesses and areas of concern that must be acknowledged. First, despite the defined mechanism of action, the moderate in vitro potency of ENMD-1068 (IC₅₀ ~16 μM) raises concerns about whether sufficient receptor occupancy can be achieved in vivo without triggering off-target effects. A potency in the high micromolar range may limit the therapeutic window and requires careful optimization of dosing regimens to ensure efficacy while avoiding toxicity (Azouz et al., 2020; Al, 2018).

Another challenge is that although preclinical studies in epithelial inflammation models have shown that PAR2 antagonism can improve barrier function, there is as yet no direct evidence that ENMD-1068 can specifically reverse the pathological changes observed in celiac disease. Unlike other compounds such as larazotide acetate—which has been extensively tested in clinical trial settings—ENMD-1068 remains confined to preclinical evaluations, and no clinical trials have been registered that specifically test its efficacy in celiac disease or other gluten-related disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This gap in translational research calls for rigorous preclinical studies utilizing relevant models of gluten challenge to firmly establish proof-of-concept before moving into clinical applications.

Furthermore, prior efforts to target the zonulin pathway have encountered challenges, including variable responses in permeability assays and incomplete blockade of barrier dysfunction even with agents such as larazotide acetate (Khaleghi et al., 2016; Massironi et al., 2024). These issues underscore the inherent complexity of intestinal barrier regulation, where multiple redundant pathways may compensate for the blocked signaling of a single receptor. Thus, it will be essential to determine whether a selective blockade of PAR2 with ENMD-1068 is sufficient to produce a clinically meaningful improvement in tight junction integrity and whether it may need to be combined with other therapeutic modalities (Valitutti & Fasano, 2019; Yoosuf & Makharia, 2019).

Another consideration is the physiological role of PAR2 in normal cellular processes. PAR2 is not exclusively a mediator of pathological signaling; it also contributes to normal immune and repair processes. Therefore, long-term inhibition of PAR2 must be assessed carefully for potential side effects, including the disruption of protective mechanisms or the activation of compensatory pathways that could diminish overall efficacy (Yau et al., 2016; Veres-Székely et al., 2023).

Overall, the evaluation of ENMD-1068 as a repurposed candidate for celiac disease is supported by a strong mechanistic rationale that directly targets a central event in disease pathogenesis—namely, the zonulin/PAR2-EGFR signaling cascade that leads to tight junction disassembly and increased intestinal permeability. The experimental support from in vitro epithelial models and the availability of detailed pharmacokinetic data lend credibility to the concept. Nonetheless, challenges related to moderate potency, the absence of direct preclinical efficacy data in celiac disease models, and potential concerns about the physiological roles of PAR2 underscore the need for comprehensive further studies. In particular, detailed experiments in Caco-2 cells, intestinal organoids, and HLA-DQ8 mice will be critical to validate that ENMD-1068 can indeed prevent gluten‐induced barrier disruption without compromising normal epithelial function. If these preclinical investigations yield favorable outcomes, ENMD-1068 could provide a valuable adjunctive treatment to the gluten-free diet, especially for patients with refractory celiac disease or those in whom incomplete mucosal healing persists despite strict dietary management (Patt et al., 2023; Massironi et al., 2024).
