Proposal for Apigenin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Apigenin is a naturally occurring plant-derived flavone characterized chemically as 4′,5,7-trihydroxyflavone. It is widely distributed in common dietary sources such as parsley, chamomile, celery, spinach, artichokes, and oregano. In nature, apigenin is generally present as glycosides, which undergo enzymatic hydrolysis in the gastrointestinal tract to yield the free aglycone form responsible for its bioactivity (DeRango-Adem & Blay, 2021). As a member of the flavonoid class—a subgroup of polyphenolic compounds well known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties—apigenin has been extensively studied in both preclinical and biochemical research settings. Its classification as a Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class II compound is based on its high membrane permeability but limited water solubility, necessitating the development of advanced formulation strategies to improve its solubility and bioavailability (Tang, Chen, Huang, & Li, 2017). The historical recognition of the health-beneficial effects of flavonoids has spurred significant interest in repurposing compounds such as apigenin as nutraceuticals and therapeutic agents, particularly for diseases involving chronic inflammation and epithelial barrier dysfunction (Ginwala, Bhavsar, Chigbu, Jain, & Khan, 2019). Its discovery through systematic phytochemical screening and subsequent pharmacokinetic and mechanistic studies has laid the groundwork for its consideration as a candidate to protect intestinal barrier integrity—especially in pathologies where inflammatory insults compromise epithelial tight junctions.

Therapeutic History:
Historically, apigenin has been the focus of numerous preclinical studies investigating its extensive anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. In various gastrointestinal cancer models, apigenin has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis, demonstrating its chemopreventive potential (Lefort & Blay, 2013). In addition, experimental models of colitis have provided compelling evidence that apigenin can reduce inflammation by modulating the release of cytokines and restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier (Ai et al., 2017). For instance, in rodent models simulating colitis, its administration resulted in a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), alongside histological improvements in colonic tissues (Patil et al., 2015). Its efficacy is not limited to gastrointestinal conditions; apigenin has also been evaluated in models of lung inflammation, vascular dysfunction, and even topical applications for dermatological disorders. Despite its broad preclinical utility, a formal evaluation of apigenin specifically for celiac disease or gluten-induced intestinal injury has not been performed, as evidenced by a comprehensive search on ClinicalTrials.gov—no trials have been registered under “apigenin AND (celiac disease OR gluten)” (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nonetheless, the documented benefits in conditions characterized by epithelial inflammation and barrier disruption—such as those seen in dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis models—provide a strong rationale for exploring its application in celiac disease, a condition in which gluten exposure triggers an inflammatory cascade and compromises epithelial integrity (Allemailem et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
Apigenin exerts its biological effects through multiple overlapping pathways that converge on reducing inflammation and stabilizing cellular barriers. One of its most well-characterized actions is the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), a transcription factor central to the regulation of inflammatory responses. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced models of inflammation, apigenin reduces the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, thereby limiting the transcription of several pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 (Patil et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014). Furthermore, its suppressive effect extends to upstream kinases including IκB kinase subunits IKKα and IKKɛ, which are essential for NF-κB activation under pro-inflammatory conditions such as high glucose levels and TNF-α stimulation (Yamagata, Miyashita, Matsufuji, & Chino, 2010).

In addition to its actions on NF-κB, apigenin impacts the STAT3 signaling pathway. Studies in colonic inflammation models have demonstrated that apigenin reduces STAT3 phosphorylation, thereby disrupting interleukin-6 (IL-6)-driven positive feedback loops that sustain inflammatory signaling in tissues affected by chronic inflammation (Ai et al., 2017). This dual inhibition of NF-κB and STAT3 provides a potent anti-inflammatory effect that may be essential for mitigating the immune-mediated epithelial damage seen in celiac disease.

A further critical mechanism relevant to the proposed hypothesis centers on the regulation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Under inflammatory conditions, upregulation of MLCK leads to the phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain, which in turn triggers cytoskeletal contractions and ultimately results in the disassembly of tight junctions composed of proteins such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin. Although direct evidence of apigenin acting as a robust MLCK inhibitor in intestinal epithelial cells is less abundant than its documented effects on NF-κB, several preclinical studies suggest that apigenin promotes tight junction stability. In models of colitis and oxidative stress-induced intestinal injury, apigenin treatment has been associated with increased expression and correct localization of tight junction proteins and concomitant improvements in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) (Allemailem et al., 2024). It is plausible that by curtailing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines—many of which are known to upregulate MLCK—apigenin indirectly results in reduced MLCK activity, thereby helping to preserve epithelial barrier integrity (Zulkifli, Ismail, Peng, Jailani, & Kassim, 2019).

Additionally, apigenin has been found to trigger antioxidant defense mechanisms via the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Upon activation, Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus and upregulates the transcription of various antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX). These enzymes serve to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing oxidative stress—a known aggravator of barrier dysfunction and MLCK activation (Sanchez-Marzo et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022). Thus, the combined anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions of apigenin help to establish a more favorable cellular environment for the maintenance of tight junction integrity in intestinal epithelial cells.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underlying the repurposing of apigenin for celiac disease is founded on its ability to simultaneously inhibit pro-inflammatory signaling pathways and stabilize epithelial barrier function. In a gliadin-challenged experimental setup—whether using intestinal organoids or well-differentiated epithelial cell monolayers—it is expected that apigenin administration will produce several convergent beneficial outcomes. First, by inhibiting NF-κB activation, apigenin should lower the expression and secretion of key pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, which are typically elevated following exposure to immunogenic gluten peptides (DeRango-Adem & Blay, 2021; Ai et al., 2017). This cytokine reduction is crucial because these mediators drive the inflammatory cascade that contributes to epithelial damage and MLCK upregulation.

Second, it is anticipated that apigenin will prevent or reverse the pathological upregulation of MLCK that is commonly observed in states of chronic inflammation. MLCK activation results in the phosphorylation of myosin light chains, promoting the contraction of the actomyosin ring and disassembly of the intercellular tight junction complexes. Through direct or indirect pathways—principally via reduction of the pro-inflammatory milieu—apigenin is expected to decrease MLCK activity, thereby preserving or restoring the expression and proper localization of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 and occludin. This restoration should be reflected by increases in TEER measurements, indicative of a tightened epithelial barrier (Allemailem et al., 2024).

In parallel, apigenin’s antioxidant properties via Nrf2 activation will minimize ROS-induced cellular stress, further contributing to the maintenance of barrier function. The net effect of these actions in gliadin-challenged models would be reduced permeability of the intestinal epithelium, decreased presentation of immunogenic gluten peptides, and ultimately a mitigation of the autoimmune cascade instigated by gluten exposure (Zhou et al., 2022). In summary, the expected outcome is a dual therapeutic action: suppression of inflammatory signaling via NF-κB (and possibly STAT3) inhibition coupled with improved epithelial barrier integrity through reduced MLCK activity and enhanced tight junction protein functionality.

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating apigenin as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease, several compelling factors emerge alongside notable challenges. One of the greatest strengths of apigenin is its extensive preclinical validation; its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties have been consistently demonstrated in multiple disease models, including gastrointestinal and colonic inflammation (DeRango-Adem & Blay, 2021; Ginwala et al., 2019; Ai et al., 2017). These attributes are particularly valuable in the context of celiac disease, where chronic inflammation and disruption of the epithelial barrier are central to pathogenesis. Furthermore, apigenin’s ability to modulate key signaling pathways such as NF-κB and STAT3 not only downregulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines but also indirectly influences other regulators of barrier integrity, such as MLCK (Patil et al., 2015; Allemailem et al., 2024).

Another major strength is the favorable toxicity profile of apigenin. Being a naturally occurring compound found in everyday dietary sources, apigenin is generally regarded as safe at nutritional and moderately supra-nutritional doses. Its capacity for oral administration and membrane permeability make it an attractive candidate for development as a nutraceutical or adjunct therapeutic agent. Moreover, its antioxidant activity through Nrf2 activation further strengthens its candidacy by offering protection against oxidative stress—a known aggravator of barrier dysfunction—in the gut (Sanchez-Marzo et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022).

Despite these strengths, significant challenges and knowledge gaps remain. Most notably, direct evidence for apigenin’s efficacy in the context of celiac disease is currently lacking. While preclinical models of colitis have demonstrated improvements in barrier integrity and reductions in inflammatory markers, specific studies targeting gliadin-induced epithelial damage and immune activation in celiac disease models are absent. This gap is underscored by the absence of registered clinical trials exploring apigenin’s impact on celiac disease or gluten-related pathologies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while indirect evidence supports the notion that apigenin may downregulate MLCK activity via suppression of NF-κB, direct mechanistic studies confirming its inhibitory effect on MLCK expression or activity in intestinal epithelial cells are sparse (Allemailem et al., 2024; Zulkifli et al., 2019).

Another limitation arises from the inherent physicochemical properties of apigenin. Its low water solubility poses a formulation challenge that may limit its oral bioavailability. Although strategies such as nanoencapsulation, liposomal delivery, and polymer-based carriers are being investigated to overcome these hurdles (Tang et al., 2017), additional formulation development will be necessary before therapeutically relevant concentrations can be achieved in the intestinal epithelium.

Finally, while the anti-inflammatory and barrier-protective effects of apigenin have been well demonstrated in non-celiac models, the multifactorial nature of celiac disease—as it involves genetic predispositions (HLA-DQ2/DQ8), adaptive immune responses to gluten peptides, and other environmental factors—means that translating these benefits into a clinical setting may be inherently challenging. Rigorous mechanistic studies using gliadin-challenged intestinal organoids or cell culture models, followed by carefully designed animal studies, will be required to establish whether apigenin can indeed restore tight junction integrity and suppress MLCK-mediated disruptions in celiac disease.

In conclusion, apigenin stands out as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of celiac disease due to its well-documented anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and barrier-stabilizing properties. Its ability to inhibit NF-κB and potentially reduce MLCK-mediated disruption of tight junctions presents a strong mechanistic rationale for its use in conditions characterized by epithelial barrier dysfunction. However, while the preclinical evidence in related models is supportive, the lack of direct data in celiac disease models and existing challenges in formulation and bioavailability represent critical hurdles that must be overcome. The cumulative evidence thus supports further investigation through detailed mechanistic studies and preclinical evaluations specifically targeting gliadin-induced epithelial damage. Should these studies confirm the hypothesized effects on MLCK expression, tight junction protein localization, and TEER normalization, apigenin could advance to clinical trials as a novel, adjunctive nutraceutical agent aimed at protecting the intestinal barrier in celiac disease (DeRango-Adem & Blay, 2021; Allemailem et al., 2024; Ginwala et al., 2019; Ai et al., 2017). Overall, given its safety profile, natural origins, and demonstrated efficacy in mitigating inflammation and barrier dysfunction in related contexts, apigenin warrants comprehensive preclinical studies to evaluate its potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate in the management of celiac disease.
