Proposal for Dimethyl fumarate (DMF)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a small molecule originally developed as a synthetic derivative of fumaric acid, a naturally occurring intermediate in the Krebs cycle. Its chemical structure makes it an α,β‐unsaturated carboxylic ester, and its synthesis typically involves either the isomerization of dimethyl maleate via Lewis acid catalysis or the Fischer esterification of fumaric acid with methanol (Manai et al., 2023). DMF belongs to the broader class of fumaric acid esters, a group known for their immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties. Historically, these compounds were first recognized and employed in dermatological applications, most notably in the treatment of psoriasis, due to their ability to modulate the immune response and reduce skin inflammation (Hennig et al., 2018). Over time, the therapeutic use of DMF expanded into neuroinflammatory conditions such as relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), where its mechanism of activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway plays a central role in its efficacy (Hennig et al., 2018; Manai et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Clinically, DMF has received regulatory approval for the treatment of psoriasis and multiple sclerosis because of its robust immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities, which are key in these chronic inflammatory disorders (Hennig et al., 2018; Manai et al., 2023). In multiple sclerosis, it is used as an oral disease-modifying therapy and has shown efficacy in reducing relapse rates while modifying disease progression, likely via its dual mechanism involving both Nrf2-dependent and independent pathways (Polak, 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Although its initial clinical applications were not focused on gastrointestinal diseases, subsequent research has explored its impact on intestinal inflammation and epithelial barrier function. Notably, in preclinical models of gut inflammation—such as chemically induced colitis—DMF has demonstrated the preservation of tight junction proteins and overall barrier integrity (Manai et al., 2023). While DMF has not been directly applied in clinical studies for celiac disease, its documented ability to modulate oxidative stress and inflammation in other settings provides a strong rationale for repurposing it for conditions such as celiac disease, where gluten-induced epithelial barrier disruption is a central pathological feature (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Manai et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
DMF’s biological activity is principally mediated by its activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its inhibitor Keap1 and targeted for ubiquitination. DMF, acting as an electrophilic Michael acceptor, modifies specific cysteine residues on Keap1 through a process known as succination, thereby disrupting the Keap1-Nrf2 complex. This modification permits the stabilization and nuclear translocation of Nrf2, where it binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of target genes (Hennig et al., 2018; Manai et al., 2023). The resultant transcriptional upregulation increases the expression of several phase II detoxifying enzymes—such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC)—which collectively elevate intracellular glutathione levels and bolster the cellular defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Manai et al., 2023; Hennig et al., 2018). In addition, DMF has been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory signaling via NF-κB and interfere with dendritic cell maturation, leading to a shift in T cell responses towards a more regulatory, Th2 profile rather than a pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 profile (Hennig et al., 2018; Polak, 2024). The compound’s dual actions—antioxidant enhancement and anti-inflammatory modulation—offer a comprehensive approach to mitigate tissue damage induced by oxidative stress and chronic inflammation.

Expected Effect in Celiac Disease:
The central hypothesis for repurposing DMF in celiac disease hinges on its ability to activate the Nrf2 pathway in enterocytes, thereby upregulating phase II detoxifying enzymes and reducing oxidative stress-induced modifications that can disrupt tight junction (TJ) proteins. In celiac disease, gliadin peptides trigger a cascade that not only activates pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress but also directly targets epithelial cell junctions, leading to increased intestinal permeability. By upregulating antioxidants such as HO-1 and NQO1, DMF is expected to mitigate ROS production and maintain tight junction proteins like occludin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) in their correct cellular locations (Manai et al., 2023). In vitro assays using gluten-exposed intestinal epithelial cell cultures (for example, Caco-2 cell models) are predicted to show reduced phosphorylation of tight junction proteins—a marker of barrier dysfunction—as a result of the diminished oxidative stress environment fostered by DMF. Furthermore, by attenuating NF-κB and downstream cytokine activation, DMF should lower the inflammatory milieu that exacerbates tight junction disruption under gliadin challenge (Manai et al., 2023; Hennig et al., 2018). This mechanistic premise is reinforced by animal studies in various gut inflammation models, where DMF administration correlated with improved intestinal barrier integrity, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and preserved expression of key tight junction proteins (Manai et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Dimethyl fumarate shows significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease primarily based on its robust activation of the Nrf2 pathway and its established anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. One of the major strengths of DMF lies in its well-characterized mechanism, wherein it increases the expression of cytoprotective enzymes and maintains redox balance within cells. This mechanism is particularly relevant in the context of celiac disease, where oxidative stress contributes heavily to epithelial barrier dysfunction and tight junction disruption (Hennig et al., 2018; Manai et al., 2023). In addition, its previous clinical approval for conditions such as psoriasis and MS means that its human safety profile is already well established, mitigating the risks associated with repurposing and potentially expediting clinical development (Manai et al., 2023; Polak, 2024).

Another strength is DMF’s oral dosing regimen, which could enhance patient compliance, especially considering the chronic nature of celiac disease and the necessity for long-term treatment in non-responsive patients. Preclinical evidence in gastrointestinal models further supports its potential efficacy in maintaining barrier integrity, a critical therapeutic target in celiac disease (Manai et al., 2023). Moreover, given that gliadin-induced oxidative stress and cytokine release are key factors in celiac pathology, DMF’s ability to curtail these processes could translate into meaningful clinical benefits by preventing the disassembly of tight junction proteins and thus maintaining epithelial barrier function.

However, there are also weaknesses and concerns that warrant consideration. While DMF’s mechanism is well elucidated in the context of neurological and dermatological disorders, direct evidence supporting its use specifically in celiac disease is currently limited. The majority of preclinical studies have been conducted in models of colitis and other inflammatory gut disorders rather than in gluten-induced epithelial damage models. Therefore, while the mechanistic rationale is sound, the lack of direct experimental data in gliadin challenge assays or celiac disease-specific preclinical studies represents a significant gap that must be addressed in future research (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Manai et al., 2023).

Another consideration is the potential gastrointestinal side effects linked to DMF’s metabolism. DMF is completely hydrolyzed in the intestine to monomethyl fumarate (MMF) and methanol; while MMF is associated with beneficial effects, the byproduct methanol has been implicated in gastrointestinal irritation. Although lower doses or modified formulations (such as gastro-resistant tablets or related derivatives like diroximel fumarate) have been designed to mitigate these effects, this aspect will require careful optimization in the context of celiac patients, who already suffer from compromised gut barrier function (Manai et al., 2023).

In summary, DMF exhibits multiple strengths that support its repurposing for celiac disease: its well-established mechanism of activating Nrf2 and upregulating antioxidant enzymes aligns directly with the pathological need to counteract gliadin-induced oxidative stress; its clinical history and safety profile in other chronic inflammatory conditions make it a practical candidate; and its preclinical benefits in preserving intestinal barrier integrity provide encouraging, albeit indirect, evidence for efficacy. The primary limitations lie in the need for direct preclinical and clinical studies demonstrating its effects on gliadin-induced tight junction disruption specifically in celiac disease, as well as addressing potential gastrointestinal tolerability issues. Overall, DMF appears to be a promising candidate for celiac disease treatment, but further targeted investigations in appropriate disease models are essential to confirm its efficacy and optimize its formulation for this new indication (Hennig et al., 2018; Manai et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Polak, 2024).
