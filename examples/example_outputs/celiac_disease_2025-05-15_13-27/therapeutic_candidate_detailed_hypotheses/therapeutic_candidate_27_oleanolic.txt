Proposal for Oleanolic acid

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Oleanolic acid (OA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid that is widely distributed in over 2000 plant species, including olive leaves, apple skins, and numerous medicinal herbs. It is a member of the triterpenoid class of compounds, whose unique cyclic structure has long been associated with diverse pharmacological activities, ranging from anti‐inflammatory and antioxidant to hepatoprotective and metabolic regulatory effects (Sen, 2020, pp. 1–2). Traditionally, compounds of this class have been used in herbal medicine for liver protection, anti‐diabetic therapy, and general wellness, in part owing to their overall favorable safety profiles and extensive human dietary exposure. OA was originally discovered and later isolated as a bioactive constituent of many plant extracts, and its structure and synthetic derivatives have been extensively characterized for their ability to modulate immune responses and oxidative pathways. As a repurposed therapeutic candidate, OA belongs to those natural products that have been historically consumed as part of the human diet and have subsequently been investigated for their potential to modulate molecular pathways implicated in various chronic diseases (Sen, 2020, pp. 1–2; Castellano et al., 2013, pp. 1–2).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of oleanolic acid is robust, with a wealth of preclinical studies that have demonstrated its diverse bioactivities. Biochemically, OA has been used in numerous studies as a hepatoprotective agent to reduce liver toxicity induced by chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and acetaminophen (Chen et al., 2014, pp. 26–28). In animal models, it has been shown to ameliorate inflammatory conditions like experimental colitis and autoimmune encephalomyelitis, as well as to counter metabolic dysfunction in diabetes and obesity models (Sen, 2020, pp. 1–2; Castellano et al., 2013, pp. 1–2). Although clinical trial databases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) have yet to yield any studies directly targeting celiac disease, numerous rodent studies in inflammatory bowel models have documented improvements in intestinal barrier integrity and reductions in inflammatory cytokine levels after OA treatment, suggesting possible translational value. Moreover, the compound’s established use in human herbal preparations, its known oral bioavailability when administered with lipophilic matrices, and its favorable safety record in other clinical contexts collectively support further evaluation of OA as a repurposed candidate for celiac disease (Sen, 2020, pp. 1–2; Xue et al., 2022, pp. 1–2).

Mechanism of Action:
Oleanolic acid exerts its biological effects via a multifaceted mechanism of action that encompasses nuclear receptor modulation, inhibition of proinflammatory signaling pathways, and promotion of endogenous antioxidant defenses. One of the key proposed mechanisms is its activity as an agonist for nuclear receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and pregnane X receptor (PXR), which are critically involved in the transcriptional regulation of metabolic, detoxification, and anti-inflammatory genes (Sen, 2020, p. 19). Activation of PPARα by OA is thought to upregulate the expression of genes coding for tight junction proteins, such as claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1, thereby enhancing epithelial barrier integrity. In parallel, PXR activation induces the transcription of detoxification enzymes and transporters that may mitigate xenobiotic stress and inflammation (Sen, 2020, pp. 17–19; Lin et al., 2018, pp. 12–13).

On a molecular level, OA has been documented to activate the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2, thereby enhancing the expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (Castellano et al., 2013, pp. 7–8; Sen, 2020, pp. 5–6). This activation helps counteract oxidative stress, a prominent feature in inflammatory processes and epithelial barrier disruption in diseases like celiac disease. Additionally, OA inhibits the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway, leading to a reduction in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines—for example, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)—which are centrally implicated in cytokine-induced barrier loss (Sen, 2020, pp. 5–6; Gutierrez et al., 2020, pp. 15–16).

Further reinforcing its anti-inflammatory potential, OA modulates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and other signaling cascades, reducing phosphorylation events associated with proinflammatory responses (Dong et al., 2020, pp. 9–10). Moreover, recent studies have indicated that OA can exert beneficial effects on intestinal epithelial cells by preserving tight junction protein localization, as seen in Caco-2 models where OA treatment restored the continuous belt-like pattern of ZO-1 under TNFα challenge (Gutierrez et al., 2020, pp. 10–12). Additionally, oleanolic acid has been shown to reshape gut microbiota composition in rodents by increasing beneficial commensals—such as Lactobacillus and Ruminiclostridium—and decreasing opportunistic pathogens that may otherwise exacerbate intestinal inflammation (Xue et al., 2022, pp. 5–8). Although direct evidence of OA’s participation in upregulating antioxidant gene transcription specifically in intestinal epithelial cells remains to be fully elucidated, the combined literature supports a model in which OA minimizes oxidative injury and inflammatory cytokine production, thereby protecting cellular junctions and barrier integrity (Sen, 2020, pp. 9–10; Castellano et al., 2022, pp. 18–20).

Expected Effect:
For the proposed hypothesis in the context of celiac disease, the expected effect of oleanolic acid is that it will activate PPARα and PXR within intestinal epithelial cells, leading to the transcriptional induction of tight junction proteins and antioxidant enzymes. This activation is predicated on the understanding that nuclear receptors such as PPARα and PXR are intrinsically expressed in intestinal cells and regulate genes involved in barrier maintenance and detoxification (Sen, 2020, p. 19; Lin et al., 2018, pp. 12–13). In practice, under gliadin challenge—a model that mimics the proinflammatory and barrier-disruptive effects observed in celiac disease—OA is expected to mitigate cytokine-induced loss of barrier integrity by upregulating genes encoding claudins, occludins, and ZO-1. Preclinical models of rodent colitis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) have provided evidence that OA treatment can restore transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and reduce paracellular flux, thereby normalizing intestinal permeability (Gutierrez et al., 2020, pp. 10–12; Sen, 2020, pp. 9–10).

Furthermore, by activating Nrf2 through its antioxidant mechanisms, OA is anticipated to enhance the transcription of genes involved in the cellular antioxidant defense system, which will help lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-15. This antioxidant effect is crucial because oxidative stress is a known contributor to the disruption of tight junction proteins in intestinal epithelia (Castellano et al., 2013, pp. 7–8; Sen, 2020, pp. 8–9). In vitro studies using Caco-2 monolayers—which model the intestinal barrier—have shown that treatment with OA prevents the cytokine-induced mislocalization of ZO-1 and preserves barrier function, as measured by TEER and fluorescent dextran permeability assays (Gutierrez et al., 2020, pp. 10–12). Thus, under the experimental conditions involving gliadin stimulation, it is expected that OA will reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines (including IL-15 and TNF-α), restore tight junction integrity, and normalize TEER values, collectively mitigating the epithelial barrier loss characteristic of celiac disease (Sen, 2020, pp. 9–10; Xue et al., 2022, pp. 8–9).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on the comprehensive review of the literature, oleanolic acid presents as a promising candidate for repurposing towards the treatment of celiac disease. Its strengths lie in its natural origin, which is associated with a long history of human dietary exposure and a favorable safety profile, as evidenced by its extensive use in herbal supplements and its administration in prediabetic human studies (Sen, 2020, pp. 1–2; Castellano et al., 2022, pp. 20–21). Its multifaceted mechanism of action, particularly its capacity to activate nuclear receptors such as PPARα and PXR, confer it with the potential to upregulate the expression of tight junction proteins and antioxidant enzymes. This molecular activity is essential for maintaining and restoring intestinal epithelial barrier integrity under inflammatory conditions—a critical pathophysiological feature of celiac disease (Sen, 2020, pp. 17–19; Lin et al., 2018, pp. 12–13).

Additionally, OA’s demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects—mediated via inhibition of the NF-κB pathway and reduction in proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-15—further support its theoretical utility in mitigating the gliadin-induced inflammatory cascade that disrupts intestinal barrier function in celiac disease (Unknown Reference; Dong et al., 2020, pp. 9–10). Preclinical models in rodent colitis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis have provided encouraging data regarding its efficacy in restoring barrier function, normalizing TEER, and modulating the gut microbiota in a manner that supports gut homeostasis (Xue et al., 2022, pp. 5–8; Gutierrez et al., 2020, pp. 1–2).

However, there are notable weaknesses and gaps in the current evidence base. Foremost among these is the absence of any clinical data directly addressing the use of oleanolic acid in celiac disease, as clinical trial searches have yet to return pertinent studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, while several studies support its activity in improving epithelial barrier integrity in rodent models, the translation of these findings to human intestinal biology remains to be fully established. It is also important to note that certain reports have mentioned potential hepatotoxicity under conditions of repeated or high-dose administration in animal models, which underscores the necessity of careful dosing and safety profiling in future clinical investigations (Sen, 2020, pp. 14–15, 25–26).

From a mechanistic perspective, although the activation of PPARα and PXR is hypothesized based on the molecular pharmacology literature, direct evidence in the specific context of intestinal epithelial cells challenged by gliadin is still lacking. Future experiments should be designed to examine whether OA indeed upregulates tight junction proteins such as claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 in human intestinal organoid models exposed to gliadin and whether it concomitantly reduces inflammatory cytokine production (Sen, 2020, pp. 16–17; Gutierrez et al., 2020, pp. 15–16). In addition, the influence of OA on antioxidant gene transcription via Nrf2 activation in the gut needs further elucidation in order to validate its protective effects against oxidative stress-mediated barrier disruption (Castellano et al., 2013, pp. 7–8; Sen, 2020, pp. 9–10).

In summary, oleanolic acid’s pleiotropic effects—its ability to modulate anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways, to activate nuclear receptors involved in barrier protection, and to favorably modulate intestinal microbiota—strongly support its potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease. The comprehensive preclinical evidence, combined with an established safety record in herbal use and emerging clinical data in metabolic conditions, lends significant promise to this candidate. Nonetheless, substantial gaps remain, particularly the need for data on its direct effects in celiac disease models and the determination of optimal dosing strategies that avoid potential toxicities. Given these considerations, while the current evidence is promising and supports further preclinical investigation, rigorous studies in human-relevant models and subsequent clinical trials will be essential to fully validate oleanolic acid as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease (Sen, 2020, pp. 17–19; Gutierrez et al., 2020, pp. 10–12; Xue et al., 2022, pp. 5–8; Lin et al., 2018, pp. 12–13).
