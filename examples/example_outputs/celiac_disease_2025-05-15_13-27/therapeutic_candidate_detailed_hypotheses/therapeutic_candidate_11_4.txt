Proposal for 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) is a synthetic, low‐molecular‐weight fatty acid derivative originally developed as an alternative ammonia scavenger for urea cycle disorders. It has since been discovered to function as a chemical chaperone that restores protein homeostasis by assisting in proper protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Chemically, 4-PBA is a straight‐chain fatty acid substituted at the para position with a phenyl ring, which confers properties that enable it to interact with misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. It belongs to the class of therapeutic compounds known as chemical chaperones, which have been used broadly in the treatment of protein misfolding disorders, metabolic conditions, and certain neurodegenerative diseases. Historically, this class of compounds has been employed to ameliorate conditions in which excessive ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) contribute to cellular pathology. 4-PBA’s ability to reduce ER stress by facilitating correct protein conformational maturation places it in a unique category of repurposed drugs already approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for rare metabolic indications such as urea cycle disorders (Kolb et al., 2015).

Therapeutic History:
The clinical use of 4-PBA spans several decades, beginning with its role as a treatment for urea cycle disorders where its ammonia‐scavenging properties provided clinical benefit. Subsequent to its initial approval, extensive research established its chemical chaperone abilities, which led to preclinical and early clinical explorations concerning its use in other protein misfolding disorders. For example, 4-PBA has been investigated in conditions such as cystic fibrosis to rescue misfolded membrane proteins like the ΔF508 mutant of the CFTR channel, and in metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, where its ability to attenuate ER stress contributed to improvements in insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; Kolb et al., 2015). It has also undergone dose‐ranging and safety studies in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington’s disease, where doses up to 15 g/day were found to be tolerated (Iannitti & Palmieri, 2011). Although 4-PBA has not yet been approved for the treatment of celiac disease or other autoimmune gastrointestinal disorders, its mechanism of reducing ER stress has been extensively explored in diverse cellular contexts, including enterocytes exposed to gliadin peptides. Preclinical investigations, such as those by Monzani and colleagues, have highlighted a potential application in celiac disease by demonstrating that ER stress plays a key role in disrupting tight junction protein folding and trafficking in intestinal epithelial cells (Monzani, 2022). Overall, the historical clinical use and preclinical evidence in relevant models support further in‐depth investigation of 4-PBA as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, 4-PBA acts primarily as a chemical chaperone by binding to exposed hydrophobic regions of nascent or misfolded proteins within the ER, thereby stabilizing their conformation to favor proper folding and trafficking. This mechanism reduces the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins that typically trigger the UPR. Under normal conditions, ER folded‐protein homeostasis is maintained by endogenous chaperones such as BiP/Grp78; however, when misfolding exceeds the folding capacity of the ER, ER stress sensors including PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 become activated. Persistent activation leads to upregulation of pro‐apoptotic transcription factors such as CHOP and spliced XBP1 (XBP1s), which are hallmarks of an overwhelmed UPR (Kolb et al., 2015; Monzani, 2022). By alleviating protein misfolding, 4-PBA has been shown to significantly reduce the expression of ER stress markers including CHOP and XBP1s. This attenuation not only prevents UPR‐mediated apoptosis but also mitigates the inflammatory cascades that are exacerbated by sustained ER stress. In addition, 4-PBA’s ability to restore proper protein folding extends to complex protein structures such as tight junction proteins—including zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin—which are essential for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. In enterocytes, under the assault of gliadin peptides, ER stress can disrupt the normal folding, trafficking, and localization of these tight junction proteins, leading to increased gut permeability (Monzani, 2022; Kolb et al., 2015). The chemical chaperone activity of 4-PBA enables it to prevent the aggregation and premature degradation of these crucial proteins, thereby facilitating their proper insertion into the cell membrane and supporting intact tight junction complexes. Additionally, studies in cellular models have suggested that 4-PBA can also exert mild histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory effects, which may contribute to the modulation of gene expression profiles relevant to the ER stress response (Kolb et al., 2015). This complex interplay of biochemical actions makes 4-PBA an attractive candidate for repurposing in diseases like celiac disease, where epithelial barrier integrity is compromised due to chronic ER stress and inflammation (Monzani et al., 2025b).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for deploying 4-PBA in celiac disease is predicated on the compound’s capacity to ameliorate ER stress in enterocytes exposed to gliadin peptides. In experimental models where gliadin peptides induce ER stress in intestinal organoids or enterocyte cell lines such as Caco-2 cells, the expected effect of 4-PBA is a significant reduction in the expression of UPR markers, including CHOP and spliced XBP1, which are typically elevated following gliadin stimulation (Monzani et al., 2025a; Monzani, 2022). Concomitantly, by restoring normal ER homeostasis, 4-PBA is anticipated to improve the folding, trafficking, and cellular localization of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 and occludin. This restoration is expected to be measurable by improved transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in in vitro assays, indicating reduced barrier leak—a critical determinant of disease progression in celiac disease (Monzani, 2022). Given that enterocytes inherently express these tight junction proteins, successful chemical chaperone intervention would likely demonstrate an increase in the levels and proper localization of ZO-1/occludin, thereby enhancing barrier function. Moreover, the improved barrier integrity would be expected to reduce the translocation of luminal antigens and decrease downstream inflammatory responses that contribute to the autoimmune pathology observed in celiac disease. Indeed, some preclinical models using gliadin‐challenged tissues have shown that interventions mitigating ER stress correlate with normalization of TG2 and CFTR expression, further underlining the interconnected nature of ER stress and epithelial barrier integrity (Monzani, 2022; Monzani et al., 2025a). In summary, the expected effect of 4-PBA in this context is a multi‐faceted improvement: reduced ER stress markers, enhanced expression and proper folding of tight junction proteins, increased TEER, and ultimately, a stabilization of the epithelial barrier that may prevent the immune cascade implicated in celiac disease pathogenesis.

Overall Evaluation:
The repurposing of 4-PBA as a therapeutic candidate for celiac disease is supported by a robust foundation of biochemical rationale, preclinical evidence, and a favorable clinical safety profile. Its strengths include its well‐documented chemical chaperone properties that make it effective in reducing ER stress—a pivotal event in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. The compound has an established history of use in related disorders, including urea cycle disorders, cystic fibrosis, and metabolic syndromes, and has been shown to modulate ER stress markers such as CHOP and XBP1s, restore proper protein folding, and assist in the maturation and trafficking of proteins like CFTR and tight junction components (Kolb et al., 2015; Monzani, 2022). Recent preclinical experiments in gastrointestinal models further support that 4-PBA can restore epithelial barrier function, an outcome of critical importance for managing celiac disease (Monzani, 2022; Monzani et al., 2025a). The compound’s oral bioavailability and FDA‐approved status in other indications enhance its appeal as a candidate for rapid repurposing, potentially accelerating the translation of preclinical findings into clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007).

Nonetheless, there are weaknesses that require careful consideration. Despite the strong preclinical evidence, direct clinical data on the use of 4-PBA in celiac disease or even in similar autoimmune gastrointestinal conditions are still limited. The repurposing effort would benefit from focused studies in gliadin‐exposed human enterocyte models to quantitatively assess improvements in tight junction integrity using endpoints such as TEER and precise quantification of UPR markers (Monzani, 2022; Monzani et al., 2025b). Additionally, while the safety profile in urea cycle disorders is established, potential off‐target effects that could be deleterious in the context of chronic administration in celiac disease patients must be rigorously evaluated. Dosing strategies that are effective in reducing ER stress without causing toxicity will also need to be optimally determined given that high doses of 4-PBA have been associated with side effects in other clinical contexts (Iannitti & Palmieri, 2011). Moreover, the heterogeneity of celiac disease pathogenesis and the involvement of other immunological pathways demand that 4-PBA be integrated into combination therapy strategies rather than serving as a standalone treatment. Finally, the translational gap between in vitro organoid models and clinical efficacy in patients remains a challenge that will necessitate well‐designed clinical trials with appropriate endpoints.

In conclusion, 4-Phenylbutyric acid stands out as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of celiac disease. Its ability to restore ER proteostasis, reduce UPR activation, and potentially normalize tight junction protein folding and trafficking targets a fundamental pathogenic mechanism in celiac disease—epithelial barrier dysfunction. The preclinical data across multiple models indicate that 4-PBA can effectively mediate these effects, and its established safety, oral bioavailability, and FDA‐approved status for other indications provide a solid foundation for its further investigation. Given these strengths and the identified areas for further study, 4-PBA merits additional preclinical and early‐phase clinical evaluation focusing on its effects in gliadin‐induced ER stress models and its capacity to restore intestinal barrier integrity in celiac disease conditions (Monzani, 2022; Kolb et al., 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008). These efforts will be critical in determining whether the promising mechanistic data can be successfully translated into therapeutic benefit for patients with celiac disease.
