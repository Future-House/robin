Proposal for ML-7 (MLCK inhibitor)

Below is a detailed evaluation of ML-7 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease. This review covers its origins, historical use, mechanism, expected effects in disease-relevant assays, and an overall discussion of its strengths and potential limitations, drawing exclusively on the available literature.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
ML-7 is a synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor specifically designed to target myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), an enzyme that plays a critical role in regulating actomyosin contraction and maintaining tight junction (TJ) integrity in epithelial cells. The molecule belongs to the naphthalene sulphonamide class of compounds, originally synthesized as an ATP‐competitive inhibitor aimed at interfering with the catalytic function of MLCK. Notably, ML-7 exerts its function by binding to the ATP-binding site of MLCK with an approximate half‐maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of around 300 nM, which indicates high potency. Designed for membrane permeability, ML-7 has been optimized to cross cellular membranes effectively, allowing it to reach intracellular MLCK in the gastrointestinal epithelium. This compound is part of a broader class of kinase inhibitors that have been widely employed as research tools in cytoskeletal studies, permitting investigators to modulate actomyosin contractility and study the resulting effects on cell adhesion and barrier function (Shi et al., 2007; Xiong et al., 2017). The fact that ML-7 is a synthetic agent rather than a naturally derived product allows for precise chemical modifications if necessary, and its well-documented intestinal distribution further supports its selection for conditions involving gastrointestinal barrier disruption. In the context of celiac disease, where gliadin exposure leads to immune activation and a subsequent increase in paracellular leak through tight junction disruption, a compound that can inhibit MLCK is anticipated to help stabilize the epithelial barrier, thus limiting the cascade of inflammatory events triggered by barrier dysfunction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History
Historically, ML-7 has been used extensively in preclinical studies as a tool to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying epithelial and endothelial barrier dysfunction. In numerous biochemical experiments using cultured epithelial cell monolayers such as Caco-2 cells, ML-7 has been shown to reduce the leakiness of the epithelium by inhibiting the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) that is normally driven by MLCK. For example, in studies using intestinal organoids and Caco-2 monolayers, ML-7 treatment was associated with improved transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and reduced paracellular flux of marker molecules, demonstrating its ability to restore barrier function under inflammatory conditions (Feighery et al., 2008; Qasim, 2012). Additionally, the compound has been employed to interrogate the pathways that lead to tight junction protein mislocalization—specifically the redistribution of proteins like zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin—both of which are important for the structural integrity of the barrier (Catalioto et al., 2011). Although there is no record in the available literature of ML-7 being used directly to treat celiac disease in clinical studies, its efficacy in models of intestinal barrier dysfunction has been well established. Furthermore, a broad clinical trial search for MLCK inhibitors in various contexts—ranging from gastrointestinal diseases to inflammatory disorders—indicates a significant interest among researchers in molecules that can modulate barrier function, thereby reinforcing the rationale behind exploring ML-7 for celiac disease treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ochoa et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, ML-7 acts by binding to the catalytic region of MLCK, thereby preventing the phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (MLC). Under basal conditions, MLCK phosphorylates MLC, a fundamental step required for actomyosin contraction. In the gastrointestinal epithelium, this contraction is tightly regulated to modulate the opening and closing of tight junctions, which determine the paracellular permeability of the epithelium. However, in inflammatory conditions such as those encountered in celiac disease, excessive MLCK activation is observed. This upregulation is driven by a combination of proinflammatory cytokine signaling (for example, TNF-α and interleukin-1β) and the direct effects of gliadin peptides, which together lead to an aberrant increase in MLCK expression and activity (Al-Sadi et al., 2008; Turner, 2012). The resulting increase in MLC phosphorylation triggers an augmented actomyosin contraction in the perijunctional region. This mechanical force leads to the disassembly or redistribution of critical tight junction components—including ZO-1 and occludin—effectively increasing the permeability of the intestinal barrier (Jin & Blikslager, 2020; Turner, 2012).

ML-7’s mechanism of action is based on its competitive inhibition profile: it occupies the enzyme’s ATP-binding site, thereby preventing ATP from binding and disabling the kinase’s catalytic function. This directly decreases the level of phosphorylated MLC, thereby reducing actomyosin contraction. Research shows that upon ML-7 treatment there is a correlational decrease in the disassembly of tight junction proteins, with ZO-1 and occludin remaining predominantly localized at the cell membrane rather than being internalized or redistributed (Qasim, 2012; Xiong et al., 2017). Such stabilization of the tight junction complex leads to improved epithelial barrier properties, as indicated by normalized TEER and reduced flux of small molecules across the epithelium. The importance of MLCK in barrier regulation is underscored by the observation that inflammatory mediators, such as those activated downstream of protein kinase C (PKC) or those released upon gliadin challenge, typically exert their barrier-disruptive effects via MLCK activation. Therefore, by blocking this central mediator, ML-7 is hypothesized to prevent the cascade of events that lead to barrier dysfunction (Turner, 2006; Jin & Blikslager, 2020).

Expected Effect
In the proposed celiac disease model, particularly in assays using gliadin-treated Caco-2 monolayers or patient-derived intestinal organoids, the expected outcome of ML-7 treatment can be described in several steps. First, by inhibiting MLCK, ML-7 is expected to lead to a substantial reduction in the phosphorylation state of MLC. This decrease in pMLC would attenuate the excessive actomyosin contraction associated with inflammatory stimuli and gliadin exposure. As a result, the mechanical force needed to pull apart cell–cell junctions would be minimized, allowing tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 and occludin to remain at the cell membrane and retain their proper junctional alignment (Feighery et al., 2008; Qasim, 2012).

Second, because tight junction integrity is a direct determinant of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), ML-7 treatment should normalize TEER in these models. A restoration of TEER would indicate that borders between cells are more “sealed” and that the paracellular pathway no longer permits the unintended translocation of luminal antigens or other molecules—a feature that is fundamental for maintaining gut barrier function (Jin & Blikslager, 2020; He et al., 2020).

Third, on a more functional level, assays that measure the paracellular passage of tracer molecules (such as FITC-dextran flux assays) would be expected to show decreased permeability following ML-7 treatment. This functional improvement would be a direct consequence of improved tight junction stability and reduced MLC phosphorylation, validating the concept that ML-7 is effective in restoring the physiological paracellular seal (Qasim, 2012; McKinney, 2016).

Moreover, because MLCK is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli, the application of ML-7 is anticipated to specifically target the aberrant signaling pathways that lead to barrier dysfunction in celiac disease. Under gliadin challenge, when immune-mediated signals trigger cytokine release and further MLCK upregulation, ML-7 should counteract these effects by maintaining the steady-state distribution of key tight junction proteins. This series of effects, from reduced pMLC to normalized TEER and decreased paracellular flux, directly addresses the primary barrier defect in celiac disease (Al-Sadi et al., 2008; Jin & Blikslager, 2020).

Given that the underlying rationale is supported by numerous studies in other inflammatory models, the expected outcome in celiac disease models is promising. The restoration of barrier function would not only help to limit the aberrant influx of gliadin peptides and other luminal antigens but also potentially dampen the ensuing immune response. Thus, in preclinical models, ML-7 is expected to ameliorate key pathophysiological events linked to celiac disease by re-establishing an effective paracellular seal (Catalioto et al., 2011; Qasim, 2012).

Overall Evaluation
ML-7 presents a compelling case as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for celiac disease due to its well-characterized mode of action, potent inhibitory properties, and documented effects on epithelial barrier restoration. Its development as a synthetic small-molecule inhibitor specifically targeting MLCK has provided researchers with an effective tool to dissect the role of actomyosin regulation in epithelial barrier dysfunction. The biochemical evidence in studies using Caco-2 monolayers and patient-derived organoids is particularly encouraging, with ML-7 shown to reduce MLC phosphorylation, preserve tight junction protein localization, normalize TEER, and decrease paracellular permeability (Feighery et al., 2008; Qasim, 2012).

One of the greatest strengths of ML-7 lies in its robust preclinical validation in models of inflammatory barrier dysfunction. The literature consistently demonstrates that inhibition of MLCK by ML-7 leads to stabilization of the epithelial barrier under inflammatory conditions typical of gastrointestinal diseases. In celiac disease, where gliadin-induced cytokine production disrupts tight junctions, the ability of ML-7 to prevent the phosphorylation of MLC and subsequent actomyosin-driven junction opening is mechanistically sound (Al-Sadi et al., 2008; Turner, 2012). Its documented intestinal distribution further supports its potential use as a localized therapy within the gut.

However, ML-7 is not without its limitations. A significant concern revolves around its selectivity. As an ATP-competitive inhibitor, ML-7 may also interact with other kinases that share similar ATP-binding domains. This raises the possibility of off-target effects that could compromise functions in smooth muscle, cardiac tissue, and other critical systems. The potential for such off-target interactions may lead to unwanted side effects, including disturbances in vascular tone or gastrointestinal motility (Xiong et al., 2017; Rigor et al., 2013). Addressing this issue would require careful dose optimization and may even necessitate the development of more selective analogs or localized delivery methods that minimize systemic exposure.

Another challenge is the current lack of direct clinical evidence supporting the use of ML-7 in celiac disease. Although numerous studies have validated its function in improving barrier integrity in inflammatory models, ML-7 has not been evaluated in clinical trials for celiac disease. The extensive number of clinical studies involving MLCK inhibitors in intestinal diseases, as highlighted by broad clinical trial searches, indicates a strong research interest; however, translation into therapeutic use for celiac disease remains at an early stage (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ochoa et al., 2023). Therefore, further research using disease-specific models—such as gliadin-challenged patient-derived organoids—and rigorous toxicological studies would be essential to fully validate its potential.

Moreover, the ATP-competitive mechanism of ML-7, while effective in vitro, may not entirely capture the complex regulation of MLCK in vivo. In the inflammatory microenvironment of celiac disease, multiple signaling pathways converge to upregulate MLCK activity. Some studies suggest that targeting the recruitment or localization of specific MLCK isoforms (for example, MLCK1) might yield better specificity and fewer side effects compared to broad ATP-competitive inhibitors (Graham et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2024). Such next-generation inhibitors, or alternative strategies that modulate MLCK activity indirectly, may eventually provide safer therapeutic profiles. Nonetheless, the extensive mechanistic data gathered with ML-7 continue to make it a valuable candidate and an important proof-of-concept agent to validate MLCK as a therapeutic target in celiac disease.

In terms of expected cellular effects, ML-7 has been repeatedly shown to decrease the phosphorylation of MLC, a direct readout for MLCK activity. This biochemical effect translates into a more stabilized cytoskeletal and junctional architecture with preserved localization of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 and occludin. In experimental models, these changes are accompanied by improvements in TEER and reduced paracellular leakage—both quantitative indicators of enhanced epithelial barrier function (Jin & Blikslager, 2020; Qasim, 2012). Given the strong evidence that MLCK is hyperactive in inflammatory states and that its activation contributes to barrier defects in conditions like Crohn’s disease and likely celiac disease, the ability of ML-7 to counteract these processes is a major asset in its favor (Al-Sadi et al., 2008; Turner, 2012).

Another strength of ML-7 is its well-characterized preclinical profile as a research tool. Over decades of study, ML-7’s inhibitory effects on MLCK have been reproducibly demonstrated in a range of models. This body of work not only confirms the central role of MLCK in barrier regulation but also provides a clear rationale for its inhibition in disease states where barrier dysfunction is pathogenic. The extensive documentation of ML-7’s effects in epithelial cell monolayer systems and patient-derived organoids, along with its robust biochemical profile, lays a strong foundation for its further development and optimization (Feighery et al., 2008; Qasim, 2012).

Despite these advantages, the translational pathway for ML-7 is not without hurdles. The off-target interactions discussed previously remain a key challenge, as systemic inhibition of kinases with similar ATP-binding characteristics could lead to adverse events. Therefore, one potential strategy to overcome this limitation would involve the formulation of ML-7 in a way that targets it specifically to the gut—for example, using enteric-coated formulations or localized delivery systems that concentrate the drug at the site of pathology. Such approaches could help minimize systemic exposure and thereby reduce the potential for adverse effects on other tissues.

A further potential limitation to consider is the context-dependent regulation of MLCK in different tissues. While MLCK is critically involved in the regulation of intestinal tight junctions, its isoforms are also expressed in other cell types, including smooth muscle. Therefore, a therapy that non-selectively inhibits MLCK may inadvertently impair normal physiological functions in these tissues. For a patient with celiac disease, where the primary pathology involves immune-mediated damage to the intestinal epithelium following gluten ingestion, limiting off-target effects is essential. Future preclinical studies might focus on comparing ML-7 to newer, more selective inhibitors that target MLCK isoforms specifically associated with epithelial barrier dysfunction. For instance, compounds that interfere with MLCK1 recruitment rather than its catalytic site have shown promise in preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease and could provide a more refined approach with fewer side effects (Graham et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2024).

It is also important to note that while ML-7 has been used widely in in vitro and ex vivo models, its safety and efficacy in vivo in humans have yet to be thoroughly characterized. The successful translation of an agent like ML-7 from bench to bedside requires rigorous pharmacokinetic profiling, toxicology studies, and clinical trials to ensure that the benefits seen in cellular models can be realized in the complex environment of the human intestine under chronic inflammatory conditions.

Taken together, the preclinical evidence strongly supports the concept that MLCK inhibition can restore barrier integrity by preventing excessive actomyosin contraction and protecting tight junction organization in the face of inflammatory challenges. In celiac disease, where gliadin-induced cytokine release and inflammation are known to disrupt the epithelial barrier, ML-7 would be expected to counteract these processes by maintaining the physiological paracellular seal. This hypothesis is directly in line with observed outcomes in models of inflammatory intestinal barrier dysfunction (Al-Sadi et al., 2008; Jin & Blikslager, 2020).

Overall Evaluation and Future Directions
In summary, ML-7 is a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent in celiac disease because it directly targets a key pathogenic mechanism: the MLCK-dependent opening of tight junctions that leads to barrier dysfunction. Its well-documented ability to inhibit MLC phosphorylation, preserve the localization of tight junction proteins (such as ZO-1 and occludin), and normalize TEER in experimental models provides strong mechanistic support for its potential efficacy. Given that MLCK activation is a critical intermediate step in the cascade triggered by inflammatory cytokines and gliadin peptides, ML-7’s capacity to block this step offers a rational strategy to interrupt the cycle of barrier loss and immune activation that underpins celiac pathology (Turner, 2012; Qasim, 2012).

The strengths of ML-7 include its potency (with an IC50 near 300 nM), its historical validation across multiple models of barrier dysfunction, and its favorable intestinal distribution—features that make it particularly relevant for gastrointestinal applications. The preclinical studies that demonstrate its efficacy in both cell culture and patient-derived organoids provide a robust rationale for further investigation. Additionally, the broad interest in MLCK inhibitors as evidenced by extensive clinical trial searches further substantiates the therapeutic potential of targeting MLCK in diseases marked by barrier disruption (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Nonetheless, there remain critical concerns regarding selectivity and the potential for off-target effects. The ATP-competitive mechanism of ML-7, while effective in vitro, does not guarantee absolute specificity for MLCK, and similar kinase domains in other proteins could inadvertently be inhibited. This issue is of particular concern given the widespread expression of MLCK isoforms and the necessity to preserve normal physiological functions in tissues such as vascular smooth muscle. Consequently, further studies must address these safety issues, possibly through targeted drug delivery approaches or through medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at improving selectivity (Xiong et al., 2017; Rigor et al., 2013).

Future directions for development include exploring localized delivery systems—such as encapsulated formulations designed for release in the intestinal lumen—to minimize systemic exposure while maximizing local efficacy. Comparative studies with next-generation MLCK inhibitors that may target regulatory domains unique to the intestinal epithelial isoform of MLCK (for instance, MLCK1) are also warranted. Such studies could help clarify whether ML-7 or a more selective compound would offer the optimum balance of efficacy and safety in the context of celiac disease. Furthermore, rigorous preclinical evaluation in animal models of gluten-induced barrier dysfunction would be essential to determine the translational potential of ML-7 before embarking on clinical trials (Graham et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2024).

In conclusion, ML-7 stands out as a valuable candidate to validate the role of MLCK in the pathogenesis of celiac disease and potentially restore epithelial barrier integrity. Its ability to reverse key functional disruptions—including reduced MLC phosphorylation, preservation of tight junction protein distribution, normalization of TEER, and decreased paracellular permeability—is directly aligned with addressing the core barrier dysfunction observed in celiac patients. Provided that further studies confirm a favorable safety profile through strategies designed to minimize off-target actions, ML-7 or related MLCK inhibitors may represent an important therapeutic approach to ameliorate intestinal barrier defects and blunt the inflammatory cascade triggered by gliadin exposure. The comprehensive preclinical evidence supports the continued pursuit of ML-7 as a proof-of-concept agent for celiac disease, while also highlighting the need for future work to optimize its selectivity and delivery for eventual clinical application (Jin & Blikslager, 2020; Yao et al., 2020; Zuo et al., 2023).

In light of the available data, the repurposing of ML-7 for celiac disease presents both an exciting opportunity and a challenge. The compelling mechanistic rationale based on MLCK inhibition, coupled with strong experimental evidence from in vitro models, provides a solid foundation for further investigation. At the same time, safety concerns related to kinase inhibitor specificity and systemic distribution must be rigorously addressed before clinical translation can be considered. Overall, ML-7 remains a promising lead compound with significant potential to restore tight junction integrity in celiac disease, and future research should focus on fine-tuning its therapeutic profile through targeted delivery strategies and enhanced selectivity. Such efforts may ultimately result in a novel treatment modality that addresses a fundamental pathological feature—intestinal barrier dysfunction—in a disease where current therapies are limited (Al-Sadi et al., 2008; Turner, 2012; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

This comprehensive evaluation, based on diverse lines of evidence from cellular biochemistry, pharmacology, and clinical research, indicates that ML-7 holds significant promise as a repurposed candidate for intervention in celiac disease. Its use as a molecular tool to inhibit MLCK activity has provided critical insights into the mechanisms that govern epithelial tight junction regulation, and its application in disease models strongly supports a role for MLCK inhibition in restoring barrier integrity. With continued rigorous preclinical work to address outstanding challenges, ML-7 has the potential to advance as a therapeutic modality that could improve clinical outcomes for patients suffering from celiac disease.
