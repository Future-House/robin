"(Paracellular Permeability Blockade, 2)","(Peptide–MHC Presentation Blockade, 6)","Candidate 1 (Paracellular Permeability Blockade) employs a FITC-dextran flux assay in well-established enterocyte monolayers (e.g., Caco-2 or gut-derived organoids) cultured on Transwells to directly measure epithelial barrier integrity after gliadin challenge. This readout is highly quantitative, size-selective, and amenable to medium- or high-throughput screening. The assay aligns with a central pathogenic mechanism in celiac disease—tight junction disruption and increased intestinal permeability—and has extensive precedent in both basic research and preclinical drug screening, including the validation of zonulin modulators and larazotide acetate. It offers simplicity of setup, rapid fluorescence readout, and clear functional relevance, although it requires complementary immune-based models for full translational validation. Candidate 2 (Peptide–MHC Presentation Blockade) focuses on the immune cascade by using fluorescent tetramers or conformation-specific antibodies and flow cytometry to detect deamidated gliadin–HLA-DQ2 complexes on APCs. This assay directly interrogates the key molecular interaction driving CD4+ T-cell activation and is mechanistically insightful. It provides single-cell resolution and quantitative kinetics of peptide loading, and has been used with primary patient-derived cells and affinity-engineered TCR-like antibodies. However, it demands specialized reagents, substantial assay validation, and resource-intensive flow cytometry, which can limit throughput and standardization. Both assays faithfully model distinct, critical aspects of celiac pathogenesis—barrier dysfunction versus antigen presentation—but diverge in complexity, scalability, and direct functional readout.","While the peptide–MHC presentation blockade assay offers high mechanistic specificity and direct measurement of the immunopathogenic event, it is resource-intensive, less amenable to high-throughput screening, and depends on specialized reagents whose reproducibility can vary. In contrast, the paracellular permeability blockade assay is simple, rapid, quantitative, and already widely validated for screening agents that restore tight junction integrity—a clinically relevant endpoint in celiac disease. Its ease of implementation in standard labs, robust fluorescence readout, and direct link to disease activity favor its selection for early-stage drug discovery, with flexibility to integrate complementary immune assays later. Therefore, Candidate 1 is the superior in vitro platform for initial therapeutic screening.",0,"(2, 6)","{'hypothesis': 'Paracellular Permeability Blockade', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay quantifies paracellular permeability blockade through measuring the flux of FITC-dextran across gliadin-treated enterocyte monolayers cultured in Transwell systems. It models a critical aspect of celiac disease pathogenesis—tight junction disruption induced by gliadin peptides, leading to increased intestinal permeability. In this assay, differentiated enterocyte monolayers are treated with gliadin peptides to mimic the condition observed in celiac disease patients. FITC-dextran, a fluorescent tracer of a defined molecular weight (typically 4\u202fkDa), is then added to the apical side of the monolayer. The tracer’s passage through the paracellular space is quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity in the basolateral compartment over time. A decrease in FITC-dextran flux following treatment with a therapeutic agent indicates restoration of tight junction integrity. The biological material used includes either well-established intestinal epithelial cell lines (e.g., Caco-2 cells) or human gut-derived organoids that have been adapted into monolayer cultures (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 4-6, gujral2015effectofantigliadin pages 8-9).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nTight junction integrity and the regulation of paracellular permeability are central to the pathogenesis of celiac disease. In celiac disease, gliadin peptides compromise tight junction function, thereby increasing intestinal barrier permeability and facilitating immune activation (khaleghi2016thepotentialutility pages 1-2). Clinically, increased intestinal permeability correlates with disease activity and severity, as impaired tight junctions allow the passage of immunogenic gliadin peptides into the lamina propria, triggering inflammation and tissue damage (schumann2017celiacdiseaserole pages 10-13). Moreover, mucosal biomarkers, such as zonulin, have been closely linked with tight junction regulation and represent both therapeutic targets and diagnostic indicators (khaleghi2016thepotentialutility pages 2-4). The assay directly recapitulates the pivotal mechanism underlying barrier dysfunction observed in both clinical settings and animal models of celiac disease, thereby establishing its validity as a translational model linking in vitro permeability changes to in vivo pathology (thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 109-115).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nSimilar assay strategies, such as the FITC-dextran permeability assay in Transwell systems, have been widely utilized for both basic research and preclinical screening of therapeutics in celiac disease. Human gut-derived organoid models have highlighted differential permeability between celiac and non-celiac epithelial monolayers following gliadin exposure, demonstrating the assay’s ability to discriminate pathological barrier disruption (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 3-4, freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 4-6). Additionally, studies using Caco-2 monolayers on Transwell inserts have shown that gliadin peptides significantly increase FITC-dextran flux, which can be attenuated by therapeutic agents such as larazotide acetate that restore tight junction integrity (khaleghi2016thepotentialutility pages 1-2, gujral2015effectofantigliadin pages 8-9). Key discoveries using these models include the demonstration of size-selective permeability alterations, correlations with transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements, and identification of molecular changes in tight junction-associated proteins, establishing an experimental basis for drug screening (thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 109-115).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct measurement of paracellular permeability changes, adding quantitative size-selective data that complements TEER measurements. Its in vitro nature makes it amenable to high-throughput drug screening and enables mechanistic studies on tight junction modulation. The assay has strong translational relevance given the direct link between tight junction disruption and celiac disease pathogenesis, as well as supporting clinical observations regarding increased permeability (thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 109-115, khaleghi2016thepotentialutility pages 1-2). However, weaknesses include the inherent limitations of in vitro models; they may not fully recapitulate the complex interplay between epithelial cells, immune components, and the intestinal microbiota, which are crucial in celiac disease. Moreover, while FITC-dextran assays offer quantitative data on permeability, they may not distinguish between paracellular and transcellular transport routes unless coupled with complementary assays. In summary, while the FITC-dextran flux assay in gliadin-treated Transwell systems is a robust and relevant tool for early-stage drug discovery in celiac disease, additional model systems and in vivo validations are recommended to fully appraise therapeutic efficacy (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 4-6, thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 109-115).', 'index': '2'}","{'hypothesis': 'Peptide–MHC Presentation Blockade', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis peptide–MHC presentation blockade assay is engineered to model the central event in celiac disease pathogenesis, namely the presentation of deamidated gliadin peptides by disease-associated HLA-DQ2 molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs).

LC-MS/MS is then applied to the cell culture supernatants to measure the levels of deamidated and cross-linked peptide species. This assay models a critical step in celiac disease (CD) pathogenesis, where TG2-mediated modifications enhance gliadin peptide immunogenicity, leading to T cell activation via binding to HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules. The approach relies on using biologically relevant substrates (gliadin peptides) and, optimally, gut epithelial cell cultures or cell lysates that more accurately recapitulate the enzyme’s behavior in the small intestine (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 10-11, alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease is primarily driven by the enzymatic activity of TG2, which converts gliadin peptides into more immunogenic forms through deamidation and cross-linking. The generation of these modified gliadin epitopes is fundamental to the pathogenesis of CD because they bind with increased affinity to HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 molecules, thereby activating pathogenic CD4+ T cells and precipitating the inflammatory cascade associated with intestinal damage (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183, buchold2022featuresofzed1227 pages 2-3). Clinical observations further support this model, given that alterations in TG2 expression and activity correlate with disease activity, and serological markers such as anti-TG2 antibodies serve as reliable diagnostic indicators (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 4-5). Moreover, the translational success of TG2 inhibitors in preclinical models underlines the clinical importance of directly targeting this biochemical pathway (wichka2024rapiddiscoveryof pages 1-2).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nAssays designed to quantify TG2-mediated deamidation are not entirely new. Initial studies have applied fluorescence-based assays, for example, monitoring ammonia release as a surrogate marker for deamidation activity on gliadin and other substrates (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 173-177, pages 180-183). More recently, LC-MS/MS platforms have been integrated into these studies to provide direct chemical characterization of gliadin modifications, overcoming the limitations of antibody-based detection methods and offering high sensitivity and specificity in profiling pathogenic epitopes (alves2017determinationofgluten pages 6-8, palanski2022anefficienturine pages 1-4). This evolution in assay design has led to improved evaluation of inhibitor potency, target engagement, and a more nuanced understanding of the molecular events that drive CD pathogenesis (buchold2022featuresofzed1227 pages 11-13).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its molecular specificity and the capacity to dissect enzymatic modifications with high resolution. LC-MS/MS-based profiling provides direct quantification of deamidated and cross-linked products, offering precise measurements of target engagement by inhibitors. This level of detail is critical for early-stage drug discovery, as it links biochemical modifications directly with pathogenic epitope formation. Additionally, by employing biologically relevant substrates and cell culture models that mirror gut epithelial cell behavior, the assay offers an in vitro platform that is pathophysiologically relevant (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 10-11, alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183).\n\nHowever, there are potential weaknesses. The complexity of LC-MS/MS may introduce challenges in assay standardization and reproducibility, particularly regarding sample preparation from cell culture supernatants.

Although it lacks additional readouts such as barrier integrity or dendritic cell involvement, its multi-analyte cytokine endpoints provide mechanistic insight across key immunological pathways.","Candidate 2 is the superior assay because it directly models the epithelial–immune cell interactions driving celiac disease and measures multiple pathologically relevant cytokines in response to the physiological trigger (gliadin). These functional endpoints are more biologically informative for assessing therapeutic modulation of the inflammatory cascade than a single‐pathway reporter. Despite increased complexity and potential variability, the co-culture multiplex cytokine assay offers mechanistic relevance and translational value that align with the committee’s preference for biologically functional, disease-relevant in vitro models.",3,"(4, 8)","{'hypothesis': 'NF-κB Signaling Suppression', 'answer': ""Assay Overview:  \nThe proposed assay employs Caco‑2 or HT‑29 cells that have been stably transfected with an NF‑κB luciferase reporter construct. This in vitro model is designed to simulate a key aspect of celiac disease pathogenesis—namely, the pro‑inflammatory activation of intestinal epithelial cells by gliadin peptides or cytokines. Upon exposure to these stimuli, the activated NF‑κB pathway drives the transcription of luciferase, providing a quantifiable luminescence output with a high dynamic range and kinetic capability. This output allows researchers to directly measure the impact of candidate therapeutic compounds on NF‑κB activation with high sensitivity and throughput (yu2022thenutritionalintervention pages 9-10).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nNF‑κB signaling plays a central role in the initiation and propagation of inflammation in celiac disease, as gliadin peptides trigger NF‑κB activation that results in the secretion of pro‑inflammatory cytokines and contributes to mucosal damage. The involvement of NF‑κB in mediating immune and oxidative stress responses has been consistently documented in both biomedical and clinical studies. For instance, resveratrol studies have shown that suppression of NF‑κB can ameliorate gut inflammation in celiac disease models, underscoring the mechanistic relevance of the pathway in disease progression (yu2022thenutritionalintervention pages 1-2). Moreover, clinical trial interest in NF‑κB, luminescence‐based readouts, and intestinal epithelial models reinforces the translational significance of this pathway in drug discovery for celiac disease (Clinical Trials Search: AREA[Condition]celiac disease AND AREA[Keyword]NF-κB OR luciferase OR intestinal epithelial model).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nHistorically, NF‑κB luciferase reporter assays in Caco‑2 and HT‑29 cells have served as effective platforms to dissect the molecular mechanisms of inflammatory signaling in the gut. This assay format has been previously applied to screen anti‑inflammatory agents and to assess the impact of natural compounds like resveratrol in modulating NF‑κB activation. Key studies have demonstrated that modulation of NF‑κB in these intestinal epithelial models correlates with decreases in cytokine secretion and improved barrier function, providing valuable mechanistic insights into potential therapeutic effects (shearer2022investigationofnovel pages 75-79, yu2022thenutritionalintervention pages 12-13). Additionally, investigations into gluten‑induced signaling and RNA methylation-dependent mechanisms further highlight the value of these cellular models in understanding regulatory processes contributing to celiac disease pathogenesis (olazagoitiagarmendia2022gluteninducedrnamethylation pages 8-8).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its high sensitivity and quantitative output, which enable kinetic measurements of inflammatory signaling in real time. The use of an immortalized human intestinal epithelial cell line provides a reproducible and well‑characterized system that is amenable to high‑throughput screening for modulators of NF‑κB activity. In addition, the assay focuses on a key pathogenic event (NF‑κB activation) that is centrally linked to gliadin‑mediated inflammation in celiac disease, rendering it directly relevant to screening potential therapeutics aimed at reducing this inflammatory cascade (yu2022thenutritionalintervention pages 9-10).\n\nHowever, several weaknesses should be noted. First, Caco‑2 and HT‑29 cells, although useful, are limited in their capacity to fully recapitulate the complex in vivo environment of the intestinal mucosa, which involves multiple cell types, immune interactions, and three‑dimensional architecture that are better modeled in organoids (NCT05294107). Second, while NF‑κB signaling is an important mediator of inflammation, celiac disease pathogenesis is multifactorial and involves adaptive immune responses and additional pathways such as those involving FLT3 and ATG16L1, which may be underrepresented in a single‑readout assay (OpenTargets Search: celiac disease-NFKB1,NFKB2,RELA,RELB,RELC). Finally, the assay’s dependence on over‑expressed luciferase reporters might sometimes mask subtle modulatory effects or compensatory pathways that occur in a more physiologically representative system.\n\nIn conclusion, while the NF‑κB luciferase reporter assay in Caco‑2 or HT‑29 cells provides a robust, sensitive, and high‑throughput platform for initial screening of anti‑inflammatory compounds relevant to celiac disease, complementary models—including organoid systems and broader pathway analyses—are advisable to fully capture the complexity of the disease's pathogenesis (yu2022thenutritionalintervention pages 9-10, olazagoitiagarmendia2022gluteninducedrnamethylation pages 9-9)."", 'index': '4'}","{'hypothesis': 'Pro-inflammatory Cytokine Modulation', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay is designed as a co-culture system where intestinal epithelial cells are grown together with intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and then challenged with gliadin peptides.

The biological rationale is robust: gliadin‐induced barrier disruption is a validated pathogenic mechanism with translational biomarkers (zonulin, TEER, histology), and multiple studies demonstrate that candidate therapeutics (e.g., larazotide) attenuate FITC‐dextran flux. The assay’s simplicity, speed, reproducibility, and direct readout of a disease‐relevant functional endpoint align with standard in vitro workflows.

Candidate 2 utilizes a co‐culture of intestinal epithelial cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes to model epithelial–immune cross‐talk, measuring a panel of pro‐inflammatory cytokines via multiplex bead arrays. This approach captures relevant immunopathology (IL‐15, IFN‐γ, IL‐21), provides a systems‐level inflammatory profile, and reflects gliadin‐triggered immune activation. However, the complexity of primary immune cell sourcing, donor variability, and the need for specialized multiplex platforms limit throughput, reproducibility, and assay simplicity.

In this assay, differentiated enterocyte monolayers are treated with gliadin peptides to mimic the condition observed in celiac disease patients. FITC-dextran, a fluorescent tracer of a defined molecular weight (typically 4\u202fkDa), is then added to the apical side of the monolayer. The tracer’s passage through the paracellular space is quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity in the basolateral compartment over time. A decrease in FITC-dextran flux following treatment with a therapeutic agent indicates restoration of tight junction integrity. The biological material used includes either well-established intestinal epithelial cell lines (e.g., Caco-2 cells) or human gut-derived organoids that have been adapted into monolayer cultures (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 4-6, gujral2015effectofantigliadin pages 8-9).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nTight junction integrity and the regulation of paracellular permeability are central to the pathogenesis of celiac disease. In celiac disease, gliadin peptides compromise tight junction function, thereby increasing intestinal barrier permeability and facilitating immune activation (khaleghi2016thepotentialutility pages 1-2). Clinically, increased intestinal permeability correlates with disease activity and severity, as impaired tight junctions allow the passage of immunogenic gliadin peptides into the lamina propria, triggering inflammation and tissue damage (schumann2017celiacdiseaserole pages 10-13). Moreover, mucosal biomarkers, such as zonulin, have been closely linked with tight junction regulation and represent both therapeutic targets and diagnostic indicators (khaleghi2016thepotentialutility pages 2-4). The assay directly recapitulates the pivotal mechanism underlying barrier dysfunction observed in both clinical settings and animal models of celiac disease, thereby establishing its validity as a translational model linking in vitro permeability changes to in vivo pathology (thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 109-115).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nSimilar assay strategies, such as the FITC-dextran permeability assay in Transwell systems, have been widely utilized for both basic research and preclinical screening of therapeutics in celiac disease.

Key discoveries using these models include the demonstration of size-selective permeability alterations, correlations with transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements, and identification of molecular changes in tight junction-associated proteins, establishing an experimental basis for drug screening (thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 109-115).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct measurement of paracellular permeability changes, adding quantitative size-selective data that complements TEER measurements. Its in vitro nature makes it amenable to high-throughput drug screening and enables mechanistic studies on tight junction modulation.

Its relevance is bolstered by established links between pMHC density and T-cell activation in patient tissues, and prior use of TCR‐like antibodies demonstrates functional blockade of T-cell responses.

This design increases physiological relevance by reflecting downstream inflammatory cascades and dietary triggers, but it introduces variability in cell sourcing, culture conditions, and signal integration. The readout is indirect and composite, reflecting many pathways rather than a single druggable event, and multiplex assays can be more time-consuming and less straightforward to deconvolute.

The readout is the surface density and frequency of peptide–MHC complexes on APCs, providing a direct measurement of peptide loading efficiency and inhibition in the presence of candidate compounds.

The inflammatory cytokines and gliadin peptides are shown to induce both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in enterocytes, leading to caspase-3 activation, a pivotal step in programmed cell death (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 5-7). Moreover, additional studies have demonstrated that increased expression of apoptotic markers in intestinal biopsies of untreated celiac patients is closely associated with mucosal injury (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 1-2). These findings are corroborated by clinical evidence showing that targeting apoptosis might improve epithelial integrity, reinstate effective barrier function, and ultimately influence disease progression. Thus, preventing apoptosis is not only a central mechanistic target but also holds translational relevance for therapeutic intervention in celiac disease (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 14-15).  \n\nPrevious Use:  \nIn previous research, similar epithelial cell models, including Caco-2 cells and patient-derived intestinal organoids, have been effectively used to model key aspects of celiac disease pathogenesis. Studies have measured caspase-3/7 activity as an endpoint to assess epithelial stress and death following exposure to gliadin peptides and pro-inflammatory cytokines (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 2-4). Furthermore, assays focused on apoptotic activity have provided essential mechanistic insights into how gliadin influences epithelial cell viability, thereby validating apoptosis as a pathogenic endpoint and a suitable target for drug screening. The readouts from these assays, including the fluorogenic detection of caspase activity, played a role in elucidating pathways that contribute to enterocyte injury, further solidifying the assay’s utility in early-stage drug discovery (manai2018theinvitro pages 13-15).  \n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct measurement of a fundamental pathological process in celiac disease and its capacity for high-throughput screening due to the rapid quantification of caspase-3/7 activity. The use of both Caco-2 cells and patient-derived organoids offers flexibility, allowing researchers to perform screening in a reproducible cell line with the possibility of validating findings in a clinically relevant human tissue model (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 2-3). This dual approach helps bridge the gap between reductionist in vitro assays and more complex tissue responses, thereby enhancing the translational potential of the discovery pipeline.  \nHowever, limitations exist. For instance, while apoptosis is a key endpoint, celiac disease pathogenesis also involves pyroptotic and necroptotic mechanisms as well as barrier dysfunction that may not be fully captured by a caspase-3/7 assay alone (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 10-12). There is also the concern that in some patient-derived organoid models, baseline apoptosis is not markedly elevated, suggesting that additional readouts such as barrier integrity or inflammatory cytokine profiles may need to be incorporated to provide a more comprehensive evaluation (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 8-9). Overall, the assay presents a robust platform for assessing compounds aimed at halting epithelial apoptosis, a validated and critical endpoint in celiac disease, but it should ideally be complemented with additional endpoints to account for the multifaceted nature of the disease pathology (gagliardi2021gutexvivosystemas pages 4-7).', 'index': '3'}","{'hypothesis': 'Gliadin Uptake Inhibition', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThe proposed assay employs fluorescently labeled immunodominant gliadin peptides—specifically the 33-mer peptide—and measures their internalization into cell types relevant to celiac disease pathology.

Measurements are principally obtained through flow cytometry or high-content imaging, which quantitatively assess the degree of gliadin internalization in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) or HLA-DQ2–expressing B cells. The use of IECs mimics the primary site of gliadin peptide interaction in the small intestine, while HLA-DQ2–expressing B cells provide a model for antigen presentation pivotal to the immune cascade in celiac disease (branchi2018theroleof pages 68-72).

In genetically predisposed individuals (e.g., those with HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 alleles), gliadin peptides cross the intestinal barrier via trans- and paracellular routes (zanoletti2024entericglialcells pages 12-15) and undergo deamidation by type 2 transglutaminase (TG2), amplifying their immunogenicity (paolella2022type2transglutaminase pages 15-17). Moreover, abnormal uptake through endocytosis or retrotranscytosis mediated by IgA or CD71 further exacerbates the immune response (branchi2018theroleof pages 68-72). Clinically, these events relate to increased intestinal permeability, inflammatory cytokine release, and immune cell activation, justifying an assay that evaluates the inhibition of gliadin entry into cells (valitutti2019breakingdownbarriers pages 8-9, castillo2015thepresentand pages 1-2).

"(Peptide–MHC Presentation Blockade, 6)","(Gliadin Modification Profiling, 9)","Both assays target critical steps in celiac disease pathogenesis but differ in biological context, functional relevance, complexity, and throughput. Candidate 1 (Peptide–MHC Presentation Blockade) directly measures the formation and inhibition of disease-relevant deamidated gliadin–HLA-DQ2 complexes on APC surfaces by flow cytometry. It captures the immediate functional endpoint—antigen presentation that drives CD4+ T-cell activation—in a cell-based platform, affords single-cell resolution, kinetic and dose–response analysis, and is translatable to patient-derived cells. Candidate 2 (Gliadin Modification Profiling) uses LC-MS/MS to quantify TG2-mediated deamidation/cross-linking of gliadin peptides in culture. It provides high chemical specificity, direct mapping of modified epitopes, and precise inhibitor engagement metrics, but in a purely biochemical (or mixed lysate) setting without measuring downstream immunological function. While MS-based profiling excels in analytical depth, it requires specialized instrumentation, extensive sample prep, and does not directly assess peptide presentation or T-cell activation. Both systems need careful standardization, but Candidate 1 better balances simplicity, throughput, and direct biological readout.","Candidate 1 is superior for early therapeutic screening because it models the key immunological step—peptide–MHC complex formation—and provides a direct, quantifiable functional endpoint in a cell-based context using widely available flow cytometry. It connects inhibitor activity to blockade of antigen presentation, the central pathogenic cascade in celiac disease. Although Candidate 2 offers molecular detail on TG2 activity, its reliance on LC-MS/MS makes it more complex, lower throughput, and removes the assay from the critical cellular interactions required for T-cell activation. For in vitro prioritization of compounds, a simple, fast, biologically relevant assay with direct functional measurement (Candidate 1) outperforms the more intricate biochemical profiling of Candidate 2.",7,"(6, 9)","{'hypothesis': 'Peptide–MHC Presentation Blockade', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis peptide–MHC presentation blockade assay is engineered to model the central event in celiac disease pathogenesis, namely the presentation of deamidated gliadin peptides by disease-associated HLA-DQ2 molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The assay uses fluorescent tetramers or conformation‐specific antibodies to detect complexes formed between deamidated gliadin peptides and HLA-DQ2; these complexes are quantified by flow cytometry. The readout is the surface density and frequency of peptide–MHC complexes on APCs, providing a direct measurement of peptide loading efficiency and inhibition in the presence of candidate compounds. The assay might be performed on cell lines or primary APCs such as B cells, dendritic cells, and plasma cells, given that plasma cells have been recognized as major peptide–MHC expressers in celiac disease lesions (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 1-3, høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 7-8).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease is known to be driven by an aberrant CD4+ T-cell response against deamidated gluten peptides bound to HLA-DQ2.5 molecules. The deamidation process—catalyzed by transglutaminase 2—enhances peptide binding affinity to HLA-DQ molecules, and the subsequent peptide–MHC complex is required for the activation of gluten-specific T cells (christophersen2019therapeuticanddiagnostic pages 3-3). Clinically, the presence of these complexes correlates closely with disease activity; patients consuming gluten exhibit robust presentation of deamidated gliadin–HLA-DQ complexes on intestinal APCs, while those on a gluten-free diet show reduced complex formation (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 3-5). Such data reinforce that blockade of peptide loading is directly relevant to the immunopathogenesis and therefore represents a compelling target for therapeutic intervention. The assay, by specifically assessing the formation and inhibition of these complexes, directly measures a critical mechanistic step in the disease cascade that leads to T-cell activation and intestinal inflammation (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 12-15).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nPeptide–MHC presentation blockade assays have been employed in both mechanistic studies and early therapeutic screening efforts. For instance, affinity-engineered human TCR-like antibodies, such as the 3.C11 antibody, have been used to not only detect but also functionally block the formation of deamidated gliadin–HLA-DQ2 complexes. These antibodies have demonstrated the ability to inhibit T-cell activation in vitro and even block proliferation and cytokine secretion, providing proof-of-concept that interfering with peptide–MHC formation can abrogate the pathogenic T-cell response (frick2019affinityengineeredhumanantibodies pages 1-4, frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 15-18). Furthermore, studies using flow cytometry to quantify pMHC complexes on APCs have clarified that plasma cells and B cells are predominant in presenting these complexes within the inflamed intestinal mucosa of celiac patients (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 7-8). Such discoveries have advanced our understanding of the cellular targets within the intestine and validated the use of this assay platform for drug discovery in celiac disease.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths:  \n• The assay directly interrogates a well-defined, disease-specific molecular interaction by quantifying the formation of deamidated gliadin–HLA-DQ2 complexes, which is central to celiac pathogenesis (christophersen2019therapeuticanddiagnostic pages 11-12).  \n• Its use of flow cytometry allows high sensitivity and single-cell resolution in detection, enabling detailed kinetic and quantitative assessments of peptide–MHC presentation and blockade efficacy (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 8-12).  \n• The platform has proven translational relevance, having been applied to both cell lines and primary patient-derived tissues, providing a robust model for early-stage therapeutic screening (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 15-20).  \n\nWeaknesses:  \n• In vitro systems may not fully capture the complex microenvironment and immune cell interactions in the intestinal mucosa, which could influence drug responses in vivo.  \n• The assay relies on highly specific reagents (fluorescent tetramers or conformation-specific antibodies) whose production and standardization could be resource-intensive, potentially affecting reproducibility across labs (frick2019engineeringtcrlikeantibodies pages 28-33).  \n• Given that regulatory mechanisms in peptide processing and antigen presentation might differ between experimental systems and human disease, complementary assays may be required to confirm biological activity seen in vitro.\n\nOverall, this peptide–MHC presentation blockade assay is a robust, mechanistically informed platform for testing therapeutic candidates aimed at interrupting the antigen presentation cascade in celiac disease (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 15-18, høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 3-5).

In this setting, gliadin peptides—especially those known to be immunogenic such as the 33-mer—are incubated with TG2 in the presence and absence of candidate inhibitors. LC-MS/MS is then applied to the cell culture supernatants to measure the levels of deamidated and cross-linked peptide species. This assay models a critical step in celiac disease (CD) pathogenesis, where TG2-mediated modifications enhance gliadin peptide immunogenicity, leading to T cell activation via binding to HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules. The approach relies on using biologically relevant substrates (gliadin peptides) and, optimally, gut epithelial cell cultures or cell lysates that more accurately recapitulate the enzyme’s behavior in the small intestine (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 10-11, alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease is primarily driven by the enzymatic activity of TG2, which converts gliadin peptides into more immunogenic forms through deamidation and cross-linking. The generation of these modified gliadin epitopes is fundamental to the pathogenesis of CD because they bind with increased affinity to HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 molecules, thereby activating pathogenic CD4+ T cells and precipitating the inflammatory cascade associated with intestinal damage (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183, buchold2022featuresofzed1227 pages 2-3). Clinical observations further support this model, given that alterations in TG2 expression and activity correlate with disease activity, and serological markers such as anti-TG2 antibodies serve as reliable diagnostic indicators (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 4-5). Moreover, the translational success of TG2 inhibitors in preclinical models underlines the clinical importance of directly targeting this biochemical pathway (wichka2024rapiddiscoveryof pages 1-2).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nAssays designed to quantify TG2-mediated deamidation are not entirely new. Initial studies have applied fluorescence-based assays, for example, monitoring ammonia release as a surrogate marker for deamidation activity on gliadin and other substrates (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 173-177, pages 180-183). More recently, LC-MS/MS platforms have been integrated into these studies to provide direct chemical characterization of gliadin modifications, overcoming the limitations of antibody-based detection methods and offering high sensitivity and specificity in profiling pathogenic epitopes (alves2017determinationofgluten pages 6-8, palanski2022anefficienturine pages 1-4). This evolution in assay design has led to improved evaluation of inhibitor potency, target engagement, and a more nuanced understanding of the molecular events that drive CD pathogenesis (buchold2022featuresofzed1227 pages 11-13).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its molecular specificity and the capacity to dissect enzymatic modifications with high resolution. LC-MS/MS-based profiling provides direct quantification of deamidated and cross-linked products, offering precise measurements of target engagement by inhibitors. This level of detail is critical for early-stage drug discovery, as it links biochemical modifications directly with pathogenic epitope formation. Additionally, by employing biologically relevant substrates and cell culture models that mirror gut epithelial cell behavior, the assay offers an in vitro platform that is pathophysiologically relevant (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 10-11, alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183).\n\nHowever, there are potential weaknesses. The complexity of LC-MS/MS may introduce challenges in assay standardization and reproducibility, particularly regarding sample preparation from cell culture supernatants. Variability in enzyme activity in cell systems compared to purified systems may also complicate the interpretation of inhibitor efficacy. Furthermore, while the assay exerts excellent analytical precision, additional in vivo or ex vivo validation might be necessary to confirm that changes observed in peptide modifications translate into meaningful clinical outcomes (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183, buchold2022featuresofzed1227 pages 11-13).\n\nIn summary, the LC-MS/MS-based gliadin modification profiling assay is a scientifically sound and highly specific approach. It effectively models a central biochemical event in CD and is well-suited for early-stage drug discovery—even though attention to assay optimization and biological variability will be vital to its successful application.', 'index': '9'}"

In this assay, differentiated enterocyte monolayers are treated with gliadin peptides to mimic the condition observed in celiac disease patients.

Clinically, increased intestinal permeability correlates with disease activity and severity, as impaired tight junctions allow the passage of immunogenic gliadin peptides into the lamina propria, triggering inflammation and tissue damage (schumann2017celiacdiseaserole pages 10-13). Moreover, mucosal biomarkers, such as zonulin, have been closely linked with tight junction regulation and represent both therapeutic targets and diagnostic indicators (khaleghi2016thepotentialutility pages 2-4). The assay directly recapitulates the pivotal mechanism underlying barrier dysfunction observed in both clinical settings and animal models of celiac disease, thereby establishing its validity as a translational model linking in vitro permeability changes to in vivo pathology (thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 109-115).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nSimilar assay strategies, such as the FITC-dextran permeability assay in Transwell systems, have been widely utilized for both basic research and preclinical screening of therapeutics in celiac disease. Human gut-derived organoid models have highlighted differential permeability between celiac and non-celiac epithelial monolayers following gliadin exposure, demonstrating the assay’s ability to discriminate pathological barrier disruption (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 3-4, freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 4-6). Additionally, studies using Caco-2 monolayers on Transwell inserts have shown that gliadin peptides significantly increase FITC-dextran flux, which can be attenuated by therapeutic agents such as larazotide acetate that restore tight junction integrity (khaleghi2016thepotentialutility pages 1-2, gujral2015effectofantigliadin pages 8-9). Key discoveries using these models include the demonstration of size-selective permeability alterations, correlations with transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements, and identification of molecular changes in tight junction-associated proteins, establishing an experimental basis for drug screening (thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 109-115).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct measurement of paracellular permeability changes, adding quantitative size-selective data that complements TEER measurements. Its in vitro nature makes it amenable to high-throughput drug screening and enables mechanistic studies on tight junction modulation. The assay has strong translational relevance given the direct link between tight junction disruption and celiac disease pathogenesis, as well as supporting clinical observations regarding increased permeability (thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 109-115, khaleghi2016thepotentialutility pages 1-2). However, weaknesses include the inherent limitations of in vitro models; they may not fully recapitulate the complex interplay between epithelial cells, immune components, and the intestinal microbiota, which are crucial in celiac disease. Moreover, while FITC-dextran assays offer quantitative data on permeability, they may not distinguish between paracellular and transcellular transport routes unless coupled with complementary assays. In summary, while the FITC-dextran flux assay in gliadin-treated Transwell systems is a robust and relevant tool for early-stage drug discovery in celiac disease, additional model systems and in vivo validations are recommended to fully appraise therapeutic efficacy (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 4-6, thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 109-115).', 'index': '2'}","{'hypothesis': 'Gliadin Uptake Inhibition', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThe proposed assay employs fluorescently labeled immunodominant gliadin peptides—specifically the 33-mer peptide—and measures their internalization into cell types relevant to celiac disease pathology. The assay models the initial step of antigen entry into the gut epithelium by targeting the endocytic uptake of gliadin. Measurements are principally obtained through flow cytometry or high-content imaging, which quantitatively assess the degree of gliadin internalization in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) or HLA-DQ2–expressing B cells. The use of IECs mimics the primary site of gliadin peptide interaction in the small intestine, while HLA-DQ2–expressing B cells provide a model for antigen presentation pivotal to the immune cascade in celiac disease (branchi2018theroleof pages 68-72). Fluorescent labeling facilitates high-throughput screening and kinetic analysis of compound efficacy in inhibiting gliadin uptake.\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nGliadin peptide uptake represents a critical pathogenic event in celiac disease that triggers downstream immune responses. In genetically predisposed individuals (e.g., those with HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 alleles), gliadin peptides cross the intestinal barrier via trans- and paracellular routes (zanoletti2024entericglialcells pages 12-15) and undergo deamidation by type 2 transglutaminase (TG2), amplifying their immunogenicity (paolella2022type2transglutaminase pages 15-17). Moreover, abnormal uptake through endocytosis or retrotranscytosis mediated by IgA or CD71 further exacerbates the immune response (branchi2018theroleof pages 68-72). Clinically, these events relate to increased intestinal permeability, inflammatory cytokine release, and immune cell activation, justifying an assay that evaluates the inhibition of gliadin entry into cells (valitutti2019breakingdownbarriers pages 8-9, castillo2015thepresentand pages 1-2). Thus, by specifically targeting the internalization of immunodominant gliadin peptides, this assay addresses the initial trigger of celiac pathogenesis, offering a mechanistic platform for therapeutic discovery.\n\nPrevious Use:  \nGliadin uptake assays have been employed in studies to elucidate the cellular pathways of gliadin translocation and in the evaluation of compounds aimed at reducing gliadin-induced toxicity. Previous research has demonstrated that blocking gliadin peptide uptake can interfere with subsequent TG2-mediated deamidation and T cell activation (buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 27-28, castillo2015thepresentand pages 6-6). Fluorescent-based methods have previously been applied to track the kinetics and pathways of gliadin peptide internalization, providing critical insights into the role of endocytosis, autophagy, and paracellular transport in disease progression (manai2018theinvitro pages 13-15). Such assays have also helped in evaluating drug candidates like tight junction modulators, probiotics, and glutenases, which aim to prevent gliadin peptide entry or enhance its degradation before an immune response can be mounted (buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12, galipeau2015exploringnovelmechanisms pages 206-210).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the assay include its mechanistic specificity in targeting the early events of antigen uptake, high-throughput capability via fluorescence-based methods, and direct relevance to the pathogenic cascade of celiac disease. By quantifying changes in internalization rates, the assay can immediately inform on the efficacy of drug candidates that block critical uptake routes for gliadin, which is a well-validated therapeutic target (branchi2018theroleof pages 68-72, zanoletti2024entericglialcells pages 12-15). It also allows for the dissection of differences between receptor-mediated and non-receptor mediated uptake, an important consideration given the heterogeneity of gliadin pathways (paolella2022type2transglutaminase pages 23-25).  \n\nHowever, weaknesses include the challenge of faithfully recapitulating the complexity of in vivo intestinal barrier physiology in vitro. The assay may not account for interactions with other cell types such as dendritic cells or the effects of the mucosal immune environment. Moreover, while useful for initial screening, further validation in more complex models (e.g., organoids or animal studies) would be necessary to ensure therapeutic relevance (valitutti2019breakingdownbarriers pages 8-9, castillo2015thepresentand pages 1-2).  \n\nIn summary, the gliadin uptake inhibition assay is a robust and insightful tool for early-stage drug screening in celiac disease, offering direct mechanistic readouts that align with both biomedical and clinical evidence on disease pathogenesis (branchi2018theroleof pages 68-72, buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 27-28).', 'index': '5'}"

Gliadin is known to initiate zonulin release, which in turn disrupts tight junction proteins (e.g., claudins, occludins, ZO proteins) leading to increased paracellular permeability—a central event in celiac disease pathogenesis. The assay technique is label‐free and offers a real‐time quantitative readout of tight junction integrity by measuring TEER before and after gliadin exposure, thereby simulating the zonulin-mediated barrier dysfunction observed in patients (binienda2020dietarycarbohydratesand pages 1-3, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 12-13).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease is characterized by an abnormal immune response following gliadin ingestion, which induces zonulin release and subsequent disassembly of tight junctions. This chain of events increases intestinal permeability and permits gliadin peptides to translocate the epithelium, triggering inflammation and immune activation. Both biomedical and clinical literature underscore the importance of this barrier dysfunction in disease pathogenesis. Specifically, tight junction disruption is pivotal in initiating and sustaining the inflammatory cascade in celiac disease, and TEER decline is a reliable proxy for assessing this disruption in vitro. The underlying mechanisms—primarily zonulin-mediated modulation of tight junctions—are well-documented, lending strong support to the use of this assay to model critical steps of celiac disease pathology (binienda2020dietarycarbohydratesand pages 11-13, aleman2023leakygutand pages 8-9, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 13-14).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nTEER assays with gliadin-challenged Caco-2 or T84 monolayers have been extensively exploited in early-stage drug screening. They have been used to evaluate the efficacy of compounds such as larazotide acetate, which directly target zonulin-induced tight junction disassembly. Key studies have demonstrated that candidate therapeutics capable of mitigating gliadin-induced TEER decline successfully restore barrier integrity and might translate into beneficial clinical outcomes. This assay has thus played a significant role in de-risking drug candidates in pre-clinical pipelines by providing mechanistic insights into barrier protection strategies (binienda2020dietarycarbohydratesand pages 1-3, aleman2023leakygutand pages 1-3, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 12-13).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nA major strength of the TEER assay is its ability to deliver real-time, quantitative, and reproducible data on barrier integrity in a controlled in vitro environment. It effectively mimics the zonulin-mediated permeability changes triggered by gliadin, which are central to celiac disease pathogenesis. The label-free nature of the assay minimizes interference and allows for direct measurement of tight junction function. This makes it a valuable tool for screening potential therapeutics and understanding the underlying biological mechanisms of gut barrier dysfunction (lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 13-14, aleman2023leakygutand pages 8-9).\n\nNonetheless, there are inherent weaknesses. The use of cancer-derived cell lines such as Caco-2 and T84, while convenient and widely established, cannot fully capture the complexity of human intestinal tissue—lacking aspects such as cell-type diversity, immune interactions, and the three-dimensional architecture of the gut. These limitations may affect the assay’s translational predictability. Recent literature advocates for complementary use of advanced models such as intestinal organoids, which better recapitulate the native tissue microenvironment, despite their increased complexity and cost (lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 3-5, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 6-7).\n\nOverall, TEER-based assays following a gliadin challenge offer a robust, mechanistic platform for evaluating barrier-protective therapeutics in celiac disease.

In this approach, intestinal epithelial cells—either a transformed cell line such as Caco-2 or patient-derived intestinal organoids—are exposed to gliadin peptides along with pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFNγ, TNFα). These stimuli simulate the inflammatory milieu and gliadin-induced cellular stress observed in the small intestinal mucosa of untreated celiac disease patients. Fluorogenic substrates that become cleaved by active caspase-3/7 produce a measurable fluorescence signal, which serves as a rapid and quantitative readout of apoptosis. This readout directly reflects the degree of enterocyte death and, subsequently, the protective effect of drugs targeting these pathways (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 4-5).  \n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nEpithelial apoptosis is a central pathological event in celiac disease, contributing significantly to villous atrophy and compromised barrier function. The inflammatory cytokines and gliadin peptides are shown to induce both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in enterocytes, leading to caspase-3 activation, a pivotal step in programmed cell death (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 5-7). Moreover, additional studies have demonstrated that increased expression of apoptotic markers in intestinal biopsies of untreated celiac patients is closely associated with mucosal injury (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 1-2). These findings are corroborated by clinical evidence showing that targeting apoptosis might improve epithelial integrity, reinstate effective barrier function, and ultimately influence disease progression. Thus, preventing apoptosis is not only a central mechanistic target but also holds translational relevance for therapeutic intervention in celiac disease (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 14-15).  \n\nPrevious Use:  \nIn previous research, similar epithelial cell models, including Caco-2 cells and patient-derived intestinal organoids, have been effectively used to model key aspects of celiac disease pathogenesis. Studies have measured caspase-3/7 activity as an endpoint to assess epithelial stress and death following exposure to gliadin peptides and pro-inflammatory cytokines (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 2-4). Furthermore, assays focused on apoptotic activity have provided essential mechanistic insights into how gliadin influences epithelial cell viability, thereby validating apoptosis as a pathogenic endpoint and a suitable target for drug screening. The readouts from these assays, including the fluorogenic detection of caspase activity, played a role in elucidating pathways that contribute to enterocyte injury, further solidifying the assay’s utility in early-stage drug discovery (manai2018theinvitro pages 13-15).  \n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct measurement of a fundamental pathological process in celiac disease and its capacity for high-throughput screening due to the rapid quantification of caspase-3/7 activity.

This dual approach helps bridge the gap between reductionist in vitro assays and more complex tissue responses, thereby enhancing the translational potential of the discovery pipeline.  \nHowever, limitations exist. For instance, while apoptosis is a key endpoint, celiac disease pathogenesis also involves pyroptotic and necroptotic mechanisms as well as barrier dysfunction that may not be fully captured by a caspase-3/7 assay alone (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 10-12). There is also the concern that in some patient-derived organoid models, baseline apoptosis is not markedly elevated, suggesting that additional readouts such as barrier integrity or inflammatory cytokine profiles may need to be incorporated to provide a more comprehensive evaluation (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 8-9). Overall, the assay presents a robust platform for assessing compounds aimed at halting epithelial apoptosis, a validated and critical endpoint in celiac disease, but it should ideally be complemented with additional endpoints to account for the multifaceted nature of the disease pathology (gagliardi2021gutexvivosystemas pages 4-7).', 'index': '3'}","{'hypothesis': 'Pro-inflammatory Cytokine Modulation', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay is designed as a co-culture system where intestinal epithelial cells are grown together with intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and then challenged with gliadin peptides. The assay specifically models the epithelial-immune cell cross-talk that is a hallmark in celiac disease pathogenesis. Measurements include the quantification of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-15, IFN-γ, IL-21, and various chemokines using multiplex bead-based assays. The multiplex technique enables simultaneous detection of multiple cytokine mediators from the culture supernatant, thereby providing a systems-level view of the inflammatory response elicited by gliadin in this in vitro model (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 13-13).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe inflammatory process in celiac disease is driven by gliadin-induced immune activation, which involves the production of key cytokines like IL-15 and IFN-γ. IL-15, in particular, is critical as it not only activates intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) but also disrupts the balance of regulatory T cell functions, thereby contributing significantly to tissue damage observed in active celiac disease (bendvold2013theroleof pages 55-58, musaico2020studyofbiochemical pages 43-46). The upregulation of MHC class II molecules on intestinal epithelial cells further supports antigen presentation and T cell activation, creating an autocrine loop that amplifies the inflammatory milieu (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 255-256). Clinically, the presence of these cytokines correlates with disease activity and epithelial injury, making them attractive targets and reliable biomarkers for therapeutic modulation in a drug discovery setting (castillo2015thepresentand pages 1-2).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nAssays that incorporate co-cultures of intestinal epithelial cells with immune components have been previously adopted to study gluten-specific responses. In particular, early studies using organoid-derived epithelial monolayers demonstrated distinctive cytokine signatures such as increased secretion of IL-15, IFN-γ, and TNF upon gliadin stimulation, reflecting similar responses observed in patient biopsy samples (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 9-10). Moreover, the integration of IELs into such systems has been instrumental in mimicking the in vivo interactions at the gut epithelium and has allowed the detection of inflammatory markers critical in celiac pathology (musaico2020studyofbiochemical pages 116-122). These assays have contributed to our understanding of how gluten peptides trigger immune activation and have provided mechanistic insights that inform current drug discovery efforts targeting the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 265-266).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay lie in its physiologically relevant design; by using both intestinal epithelial cells and IELs, the model closely recapitulates the cellular interactions of the small intestinal mucosa in celiac disease. The simultaneous detection of multiple cytokines via multiplex bead-based assays offers a comprehensive profile of the pro-inflammatory environment, which is critical for evaluating therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of action on multiple immunological pathways (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 282-284). Additionally, the use of gliadin as the challenge agent mimics the dietary trigger in celiac disease, thereby increasing the translatability of findings to the clinical scenario (castillo2015thepresentand pages 1-2).\n\nOn the downside, co-culture systems inherently exhibit variability due to differences in cell sourcing, culture conditions, and donor variability, which may limit reproducibility. Furthermore, while the assay measures a broad array of cytokines, it might not fully capture other aspects of disease complexity such as epithelial barrier integrity and the contribution of other immune cell subsets like dendritic cells or macrophages. Nonetheless, the strengths of reflecting key pathogenic events and providing multiplexed inflammatory readouts position this assay as a valuable tool in early-stage drug discovery for celiac disease (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 9-10, rahmani2024anewmodel pages 212-216).', 'index': '8'}"

The assay’s quantitative size‐selective permeability measurement complements TEER and offers mechanistic insight into barrier restoration by candidate therapeutics. Its simplicity and direct functional endpoint favor rapid iteration in early‐stage discovery.

This assay directly recapitulates the core immunopathogenic driver of celiac disease, providing disease specificity and a clear quantitative cytokine readout. However, it requires specialized cell lines or primary cells, HLA matching, and longer culture times, which reduce throughput and increase complexity. Reliance on a single cytokine marker may miss broader immunological effects. While biologically highly relevant for immunomodulatory candidate evaluation, it is less straightforward than the permeability assay for broad screening applications.","Between the two, Candidate 1 is preferred for its simplicity, speed, direct functional measurement of a key pathogenic mechanism (barrier dysfunction), and compatibility with high‐throughput formats.

It models a critical aspect of celiac disease pathogenesis—tight junction disruption induced by gliadin peptides, leading to increased intestinal permeability. In this assay, differentiated enterocyte monolayers are treated with gliadin peptides to mimic the condition observed in celiac disease patients. FITC-dextran, a fluorescent tracer of a defined molecular weight (typically 4\u202fkDa), is then added to the apical side of the monolayer. The tracer’s passage through the paracellular space is quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity in the basolateral compartment over time. A decrease in FITC-dextran flux following treatment with a therapeutic agent indicates restoration of tight junction integrity. The biological material used includes either well-established intestinal epithelial cell lines (e.g., Caco-2 cells) or human gut-derived organoids that have been adapted into monolayer cultures (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 4-6, gujral2015effectofantigliadin pages 8-9).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nTight junction integrity and the regulation of paracellular permeability are central to the pathogenesis of celiac disease. In celiac disease, gliadin peptides compromise tight junction function, thereby increasing intestinal barrier permeability and facilitating immune activation (khaleghi2016thepotentialutility pages 1-2). Clinically, increased intestinal permeability correlates with disease activity and severity, as impaired tight junctions allow the passage of immunogenic gliadin peptides into the lamina propria, triggering inflammation and tissue damage (schumann2017celiacdiseaserole pages 10-13). Moreover, mucosal biomarkers, such as zonulin, have been closely linked with tight junction regulation and represent both therapeutic targets and diagnostic indicators (khaleghi2016thepotentialutility pages 2-4). The assay directly recapitulates the pivotal mechanism underlying barrier dysfunction observed in both clinical settings and animal models of celiac disease, thereby establishing its validity as a translational model linking in vitro permeability changes to in vivo pathology (thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 109-115).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nSimilar assay strategies, such as the FITC-dextran permeability assay in Transwell systems, have been widely utilized for both basic research and preclinical screening of therapeutics in celiac disease. Human gut-derived organoid models have highlighted differential permeability between celiac and non-celiac epithelial monolayers following gliadin exposure, demonstrating the assay’s ability to discriminate pathological barrier disruption (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 3-4, freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 4-6). Additionally, studies using Caco-2 monolayers on Transwell inserts have shown that gliadin peptides significantly increase FITC-dextran flux, which can be attenuated by therapeutic agents such as larazotide acetate that restore tight junction integrity (khaleghi2016thepotentialutility pages 1-2, gujral2015effectofantigliadin pages 8-9). Key discoveries using these models include the demonstration of size-selective permeability alterations, correlations with transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements, and identification of molecular changes in tight junction-associated proteins, establishing an experimental basis for drug screening (thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 109-115).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct measurement of paracellular permeability changes, adding quantitative size-selective data that complements TEER measurements. Its in vitro nature makes it amenable to high-throughput drug screening and enables mechanistic studies on tight junction modulation. The assay has strong translational relevance given the direct link between tight junction disruption and celiac disease pathogenesis, as well as supporting clinical observations regarding increased permeability (thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 109-115, khaleghi2016thepotentialutility pages 1-2). However, weaknesses include the inherent limitations of in vitro models; they may not fully recapitulate the complex interplay between epithelial cells, immune components, and the intestinal microbiota, which are crucial in celiac disease. Moreover, while FITC-dextran assays offer quantitative data on permeability, they may not distinguish between paracellular and transcellular transport routes unless coupled with complementary assays. In summary, while the FITC-dextran flux assay in gliadin-treated Transwell systems is a robust and relevant tool for early-stage drug discovery in celiac disease, additional model systems and in vivo validations are recommended to fully appraise therapeutic efficacy (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 4-6, thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 109-115).', 'index': '2'}","{'hypothesis': 'T-cell Activation Suppression', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay utilizes a co-culture of deamidated gliadin-loaded, HLA-DQ2-positive antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with gluten-specific CD4+ T-cell hybridomas. The design specifically models the antigen presentation step that drives the aberrant T-cell activation seen in celiac disease (CeD). In this setup, the APCs, which may be professional cells (e.g., B cells) or engineered cell lines expressing HLA-DQ2 molecules, are pulsed with deamidated gliadin peptides—key immunogenic moieties generated by tissue transglutaminase (TG2)-mediated deamidation. Gluten-specific CD4+ T cells, derived from patient samples or as hybridomas, are then introduced. The primary measurement is the quantification of interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion using an ELISA, which functions as a proxy for T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement and activation (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 49-52, petersen2020tcellreceptor pages 17-20).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease pathogenesis is driven by an abnormal immune response initiated by deamidated gliadin peptides that are selectively presented by HLA-DQ2 (and HLA-DQ8) molecules, thus activating gluten-specific CD4+ T cells. This activation leads to intestinal mucosal inflammation and villous atrophy (buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12). The assay directly recapitulates this critical interaction by mimicking deamidated gliadin presentation and subsequent T-cell activation. Clinically, increased IL-2 levels have been observed post-gluten challenge in CeD patients, correlating with disease activity. This underlines the importance of IL-2 as a readout in the assay, making it an accurate marker for the immune events that occur in CeD (NCT03409796, NCT03738475).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nAssays employing co-culture systems with HLA-DQ2-positive APCs and gluten-specific T cells have a robust history in drug discovery for CeD. They have been instrumental in defining the sensitivity of T cells to specific deamidated gliadin epitopes and in evaluating the efficacy of immunotherapeutic candidates. For instance, research using similar setups measured T-cell activation via IL-2 secretion to assess the potency of novel interventions such as high-affinity TCR-like antibodies and peptide-based immunomodulatory agents (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 12-15, frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 15-18). Additionally, studies with Nexvax2 and other candidate compounds have harnessed antigen-specific T-cell assays detailing reduction in T-cell responses as a biomarker of potential therapeutic effectiveness (petersen2020tcellreceptor pages 17-20). Thus, the literature supports the utility of this approach in identifying drugs that can block or modulate the driving immunopathogenic interactions of CeD (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 252-255).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct relevance to the central events of CeD pathogenesis—antigen presentation and T-cell activation—providing a clear, quantifiable endpoint via IL-2 secretion. The use of a defined antigen (deamidated gliadin) and the inclusion of HLA-DQ2-positive APCs ensure disease specificity and high physiological relevance. Furthermore, the assay’s quantitative nature facilitates robust comparisons of drug efficacy and supports reproducibility across studies (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 49-52).\n\nHowever, there are also weaknesses and limitations. The in vitro model may not fully capture the complexity of the in vivo intestinal environment, including contributions from other immune cell types (e.g., B cells, dendritic cells) and the influence of gut microbiota. Moreover, reliance solely on IL-2 as an activation readout might overlook other relevant cytokine and chemokine cascades that contribute to CeD pathology. Integrating additional readouts, such as IFN-γ and T-cell proliferation markers, could provide a more comprehensive assessment of drug effects.

LC-MS/MS is then applied to the cell culture supernatants to measure the levels of deamidated and cross-linked peptide species. This assay models a critical step in celiac disease (CD) pathogenesis, where TG2-mediated modifications enhance gliadin peptide immunogenicity, leading to T cell activation via binding to HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules.

The assay, by specifically assessing the formation and inhibition of these complexes, directly measures a critical mechanistic step in the disease cascade that leads to T-cell activation and intestinal inflammation (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 12-15).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nPeptide–MHC presentation blockade assays have been employed in both mechanistic studies and early therapeutic screening efforts. For instance, affinity-engineered human TCR-like antibodies, such as the 3.C11 antibody, have been used to not only detect but also functionally block the formation of deamidated gliadin–HLA-DQ2 complexes. These antibodies have demonstrated the ability to inhibit T-cell activation in vitro and even block proliferation and cytokine secretion, providing proof-of-concept that interfering with peptide–MHC formation can abrogate the pathogenic T-cell response (frick2019affinityengineeredhumanantibodies pages 1-4, frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 15-18). Furthermore, studies using flow cytometry to quantify pMHC complexes on APCs have clarified that plasma cells and B cells are predominant in presenting these complexes within the inflamed intestinal mucosa of celiac patients (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 7-8). Such discoveries have advanced our understanding of the cellular targets within the intestine and validated the use of this assay platform for drug discovery in celiac disease.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths:  \n• The assay directly interrogates a well-defined, disease-specific molecular interaction by quantifying the formation of deamidated gliadin–HLA-DQ2 complexes, which is central to celiac pathogenesis (christophersen2019therapeuticanddiagnostic pages 11-12).  \n• Its use of flow cytometry allows high sensitivity and single-cell resolution in detection, enabling detailed kinetic and quantitative assessments of peptide–MHC presentation and blockade efficacy (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 8-12).  \n• The platform has proven translational relevance, having been applied to both cell lines and primary patient-derived tissues, providing a robust model for early-stage therapeutic screening (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 15-20).  \n\nWeaknesses:  \n• In vitro systems may not fully capture the complex microenvironment and immune cell interactions in the intestinal mucosa, which could influence drug responses in vivo.  \n• The assay relies on highly specific reagents (fluorescent tetramers or conformation-specific antibodies) whose production and standardization could be resource-intensive, potentially affecting reproducibility across labs (frick2019engineeringtcrlikeantibodies pages 28-33).  \n• Given that regulatory mechanisms in peptide processing and antigen presentation might differ between experimental systems and human disease, complementary assays may be required to confirm biological activity seen in vitro.\n\nOverall, this peptide–MHC presentation blockade assay is a robust, mechanistically informed platform for testing therapeutic candidates aimed at interrupting the antigen presentation cascade in celiac disease (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 15-18, høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 3-5).

In this approach, intestinal epithelial cells—either a transformed cell line such as Caco-2 or patient-derived intestinal organoids—are exposed to gliadin peptides along with pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFNγ, TNFα). These stimuli simulate the inflammatory milieu and gliadin-induced cellular stress observed in the small intestinal mucosa of untreated celiac disease patients. Fluorogenic substrates that become cleaved by active caspase-3/7 produce a measurable fluorescence signal, which serves as a rapid and quantitative readout of apoptosis. This readout directly reflects the degree of enterocyte death and, subsequently, the protective effect of drugs targeting these pathways (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 4-5).  \n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nEpithelial apoptosis is a central pathological event in celiac disease, contributing significantly to villous atrophy and compromised barrier function. The inflammatory cytokines and gliadin peptides are shown to induce both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in enterocytes, leading to caspase-3 activation, a pivotal step in programmed cell death (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 5-7). Moreover, additional studies have demonstrated that increased expression of apoptotic markers in intestinal biopsies of untreated celiac patients is closely associated with mucosal injury (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 1-2). These findings are corroborated by clinical evidence showing that targeting apoptosis might improve epithelial integrity, reinstate effective barrier function, and ultimately influence disease progression. Thus, preventing apoptosis is not only a central mechanistic target but also holds translational relevance for therapeutic intervention in celiac disease (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 14-15).  \n\nPrevious Use:  \nIn previous research, similar epithelial cell models, including Caco-2 cells and patient-derived intestinal organoids, have been effectively used to model key aspects of celiac disease pathogenesis. Studies have measured caspase-3/7 activity as an endpoint to assess epithelial stress and death following exposure to gliadin peptides and pro-inflammatory cytokines (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 2-4). Furthermore, assays focused on apoptotic activity have provided essential mechanistic insights into how gliadin influences epithelial cell viability, thereby validating apoptosis as a pathogenic endpoint and a suitable target for drug screening. The readouts from these assays, including the fluorogenic detection of caspase activity, played a role in elucidating pathways that contribute to enterocyte injury, further solidifying the assay’s utility in early-stage drug discovery (manai2018theinvitro pages 13-15).  \n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct measurement of a fundamental pathological process in celiac disease and its capacity for high-throughput screening due to the rapid quantification of caspase-3/7 activity. The use of both Caco-2 cells and patient-derived organoids offers flexibility, allowing researchers to perform screening in a reproducible cell line with the possibility of validating findings in a clinically relevant human tissue model (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 2-3). This dual approach helps bridge the gap between reductionist in vitro assays and more complex tissue responses, thereby enhancing the translational potential of the discovery pipeline.  \nHowever, limitations exist. For instance, while apoptosis is a key endpoint, celiac disease pathogenesis also involves pyroptotic and necroptotic mechanisms as well as barrier dysfunction that may not be fully captured by a caspase-3/7 assay alone (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 10-12). There is also the concern that in some patient-derived organoid models, baseline apoptosis is not markedly elevated, suggesting that additional readouts such as barrier integrity or inflammatory cytokine profiles may need to be incorporated to provide a more comprehensive evaluation (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 8-9).

Measurements are principally obtained through flow cytometry or high-content imaging, which quantitatively assess the degree of gliadin internalization in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) or HLA-DQ2–expressing B cells. The use of IECs mimics the primary site of gliadin peptide interaction in the small intestine, while HLA-DQ2–expressing B cells provide a model for antigen presentation pivotal to the immune cascade in celiac disease (branchi2018theroleof pages 68-72). Fluorescent labeling facilitates high-throughput screening and kinetic analysis of compound efficacy in inhibiting gliadin uptake.\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nGliadin peptide uptake represents a critical pathogenic event in celiac disease that triggers downstream immune responses. In genetically predisposed individuals (e.g., those with HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 alleles), gliadin peptides cross the intestinal barrier via trans- and paracellular routes (zanoletti2024entericglialcells pages 12-15) and undergo deamidation by type 2 transglutaminase (TG2), amplifying their immunogenicity (paolella2022type2transglutaminase pages 15-17). Moreover, abnormal uptake through endocytosis or retrotranscytosis mediated by IgA or CD71 further exacerbates the immune response (branchi2018theroleof pages 68-72). Clinically, these events relate to increased intestinal permeability, inflammatory cytokine release, and immune cell activation, justifying an assay that evaluates the inhibition of gliadin entry into cells (valitutti2019breakingdownbarriers pages 8-9, castillo2015thepresentand pages 1-2). Thus, by specifically targeting the internalization of immunodominant gliadin peptides, this assay addresses the initial trigger of celiac pathogenesis, offering a mechanistic platform for therapeutic discovery.\n\nPrevious Use:  \nGliadin uptake assays have been employed in studies to elucidate the cellular pathways of gliadin translocation and in the evaluation of compounds aimed at reducing gliadin-induced toxicity.

Fluorescent-based methods have previously been applied to track the kinetics and pathways of gliadin peptide internalization, providing critical insights into the role of endocytosis, autophagy, and paracellular transport in disease progression (manai2018theinvitro pages 13-15). Such assays have also helped in evaluating drug candidates like tight junction modulators, probiotics, and glutenases, which aim to prevent gliadin peptide entry or enhance its degradation before an immune response can be mounted (buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12, galipeau2015exploringnovelmechanisms pages 206-210).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the assay include its mechanistic specificity in targeting the early events of antigen uptake, high-throughput capability via fluorescence-based methods, and direct relevance to the pathogenic cascade of celiac disease. By quantifying changes in internalization rates, the assay can immediately inform on the efficacy of drug candidates that block critical uptake routes for gliadin, which is a well-validated therapeutic target (branchi2018theroleof pages 68-72, zanoletti2024entericglialcells pages 12-15). It also allows for the dissection of differences between receptor-mediated and non-receptor mediated uptake, an important consideration given the heterogeneity of gliadin pathways (paolella2022type2transglutaminase pages 23-25).  \n\nHowever, weaknesses include the challenge of faithfully recapitulating the complexity of in vivo intestinal barrier physiology in vitro.

The design specifically models the antigen presentation step that drives the aberrant T-cell activation seen in celiac disease (CeD). In this setup, the APCs, which may be professional cells (e.g., B cells) or engineered cell lines expressing HLA-DQ2 molecules, are pulsed with deamidated gliadin peptides—key immunogenic moieties generated by tissue transglutaminase (TG2)-mediated deamidation. Gluten-specific CD4+ T cells, derived from patient samples or as hybridomas, are then introduced. The primary measurement is the quantification of interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion using an ELISA, which functions as a proxy for T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement and activation (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 49-52, petersen2020tcellreceptor pages 17-20).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease pathogenesis is driven by an abnormal immune response initiated by deamidated gliadin peptides that are selectively presented by HLA-DQ2 (and HLA-DQ8) molecules, thus activating gluten-specific CD4+ T cells. This activation leads to intestinal mucosal inflammation and villous atrophy (buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12). The assay directly recapitulates this critical interaction by mimicking deamidated gliadin presentation and subsequent T-cell activation. Clinically, increased IL-2 levels have been observed post-gluten challenge in CeD patients, correlating with disease activity. This underlines the importance of IL-2 as a readout in the assay, making it an accurate marker for the immune events that occur in CeD (NCT03409796, NCT03738475).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nAssays employing co-culture systems with HLA-DQ2-positive APCs and gluten-specific T cells have a robust history in drug discovery for CeD. They have been instrumental in defining the sensitivity of T cells to specific deamidated gliadin epitopes and in evaluating the efficacy of immunotherapeutic candidates. For instance, research using similar setups measured T-cell activation via IL-2 secretion to assess the potency of novel interventions such as high-affinity TCR-like antibodies and peptide-based immunomodulatory agents (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 12-15, frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 15-18). Additionally, studies with Nexvax2 and other candidate compounds have harnessed antigen-specific T-cell assays detailing reduction in T-cell responses as a biomarker of potential therapeutic effectiveness (petersen2020tcellreceptor pages 17-20). Thus, the literature supports the utility of this approach in identifying drugs that can block or modulate the driving immunopathogenic interactions of CeD (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 252-255).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct relevance to the central events of CeD pathogenesis—antigen presentation and T-cell activation—providing a clear, quantifiable endpoint via IL-2 secretion. The use of a defined antigen (deamidated gliadin) and the inclusion of HLA-DQ2-positive APCs ensure disease specificity and high physiological relevance. Furthermore, the assay’s quantitative nature facilitates robust comparisons of drug efficacy and supports reproducibility across studies (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 49-52).\n\nHowever, there are also weaknesses and limitations. The in vitro model may not fully capture the complexity of the in vivo intestinal environment, including contributions from other immune cell types (e.g., B cells, dendritic cells) and the influence of gut microbiota. Moreover, reliance solely on IL-2 as an activation readout might overlook other relevant cytokine and chemokine cascades that contribute to CeD pathology. Integrating additional readouts, such as IFN-γ and T-cell proliferation markers, could provide a more comprehensive assessment of drug effects. Despite these limitations, the assay is scientifically sound, cost‐effective, and aligns well with current drug discovery strategies targeting T-cell mediated inflammation in celiac disease (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 265-266, buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12).\n\nIn summary, the co-culture T-cell activation suppression assay represents a robust platform for early-stage therapeutic screening in celiac disease, directly addressing a central mechanism of disease pathogenesis and offering a quantitative readout to evaluate potential interventions.', 'index': '7'}","{'hypothesis': 'Pro-inflammatory Cytokine Modulation', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay is designed as a co-culture system where intestinal epithelial cells are grown together with intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and then challenged with gliadin peptides. The assay specifically models the epithelial-immune cell cross-talk that is a hallmark in celiac disease pathogenesis. Measurements include the quantification of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-15, IFN-γ, IL-21, and various chemokines using multiplex bead-based assays. The multiplex technique enables simultaneous detection of multiple cytokine mediators from the culture supernatant, thereby providing a systems-level view of the inflammatory response elicited by gliadin in this in vitro model (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 13-13).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe inflammatory process in celiac disease is driven by gliadin-induced immune activation, which involves the production of key cytokines like IL-15 and IFN-γ. IL-15, in particular, is critical as it not only activates intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) but also disrupts the balance of regulatory T cell functions, thereby contributing significantly to tissue damage observed in active celiac disease (bendvold2013theroleof pages 55-58, musaico2020studyofbiochemical pages 43-46). The upregulation of MHC class II molecules on intestinal epithelial cells further supports antigen presentation and T cell activation, creating an autocrine loop that amplifies the inflammatory milieu (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 255-256). Clinically, the presence of these cytokines correlates with disease activity and epithelial injury, making them attractive targets and reliable biomarkers for therapeutic modulation in a drug discovery setting (castillo2015thepresentand pages 1-2).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nAssays that incorporate co-cultures of intestinal epithelial cells with immune components have been previously adopted to study gluten-specific responses. In particular, early studies using organoid-derived epithelial monolayers demonstrated distinctive cytokine signatures such as increased secretion of IL-15, IFN-γ, and TNF upon gliadin stimulation, reflecting similar responses observed in patient biopsy samples (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 9-10). Moreover, the integration of IELs into such systems has been instrumental in mimicking the in vivo interactions at the gut epithelium and has allowed the detection of inflammatory markers critical in celiac pathology (musaico2020studyofbiochemical pages 116-122). These assays have contributed to our understanding of how gluten peptides trigger immune activation and have provided mechanistic insights that inform current drug discovery efforts targeting the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 265-266).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay lie in its physiologically relevant design; by using both intestinal epithelial cells and IELs, the model closely recapitulates the cellular interactions of the small intestinal mucosa in celiac disease. The simultaneous detection of multiple cytokines via multiplex bead-based assays offers a comprehensive profile of the pro-inflammatory environment, which is critical for evaluating therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of action on multiple immunological pathways (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 282-284). Additionally, the use of gliadin as the challenge agent mimics the dietary trigger in celiac disease, thereby increasing the translatability of findings to the clinical scenario (castillo2015thepresentand pages 1-2).\n\nOn the downside, co-culture systems inherently exhibit variability due to differences in cell sourcing, culture conditions, and donor variability, which may limit reproducibility. Furthermore, while the assay measures a broad array of cytokines, it might not fully capture other aspects of disease complexity such as epithelial barrier integrity and the contribution of other immune cell subsets like dendritic cells or macrophages. Nonetheless, the strengths of reflecting key pathogenic events and providing multiplexed inflammatory readouts position this assay as a valuable tool in early-stage drug discovery for celiac disease (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 9-10, rahmani2024anewmodel pages 212-216).', 'index': '8'}"
"(Epithelial Apoptosis Prevention,3)","(NF-κB Signaling Suppression,4)","Both assays model key celiac disease mechanisms in vitro and offer high‐throughput screening potential, but they differ in biological focus and functional readout. Candidate 1 (Epithelial Apoptosis Prevention) measures caspase‐3/7 activity in Caco-2 cells or patient-derived organoids exposed to gliadin and inflammatory cytokines. This provides a direct, functional endpoint—enterocyte death—that underlies villous atrophy and barrier dysfunction in celiac pathology. The assay’s fluorogenic readout is rapid, quantitative, and amenable to scale, and the option to validate hits in organoids increases physiological relevance. Its main limitation is a singular focus on apoptosis, leaving other death pathways and barrier measurements unassessed unless additional readouts are integrated. Candidate 2 (NF-κB Signaling Suppression) uses an NF-κB luciferase reporter in Caco-2/HT-29 cells to quantify inflammatory pathway activation by gliadin or cytokines. This assay is highly sensitive, kinetic, and screens effectively for anti-inflammatory compounds. However, NF-κB activation is an upstream signaling event rather than a disease‐defining functional endpoint. It relies on overexpressed reporters and immortalized lines that lack multicellular architecture and adaptive immune components. Both assays would benefit from complementary models, but Candidate 1 delivers a more disease‐proximal functional measurement.","Given the priority for simplicity, speed, direct functional endpoints, and biological relevance, Candidate 1’s measurement of enterocyte apoptosis is more closely tied to celiac pathogenesis and provides a clear, quantitative readout of barrier‐relevant epithelial injury. While NF-κB suppression captures inflammatory signaling, it is an indirect proxy for tissue damage and may miss downstream effects on cell survival and barrier integrity. Candidate 1 can also be readily expanded with additional readouts in organoids, making it a stronger foundational assay for therapeutic screening.",20,"(3, 4)","{'hypothesis': 'Epithelial Apoptosis Prevention', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay is designed to evaluate the efficacy of candidate drugs in preventing epithelial apoptosis in celiac disease by measuring caspase-3/7 activity. In this approach, intestinal epithelial cells—either a transformed cell line such as Caco-2 or patient-derived intestinal organoids—are exposed to gliadin peptides along with pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFNγ, TNFα). These stimuli simulate the inflammatory milieu and gliadin-induced cellular stress observed in the small intestinal mucosa of untreated celiac disease patients. Fluorogenic substrates that become cleaved by active caspase-3/7 produce a measurable fluorescence signal, which serves as a rapid and quantitative readout of apoptosis. This readout directly reflects the degree of enterocyte death and, subsequently, the protective effect of drugs targeting these pathways (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 4-5).  \n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nEpithelial apoptosis is a central pathological event in celiac disease, contributing significantly to villous atrophy and compromised barrier function. The inflammatory cytokines and gliadin peptides are shown to induce both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in enterocytes, leading to caspase-3 activation, a pivotal step in programmed cell death (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 5-7). Moreover, additional studies have demonstrated that increased expression of apoptotic markers in intestinal biopsies of untreated celiac patients is closely associated with mucosal injury (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 1-2). These findings are corroborated by clinical evidence showing that targeting apoptosis might improve epithelial integrity, reinstate effective barrier function, and ultimately influence disease progression. Thus, preventing apoptosis is not only a central mechanistic target but also holds translational relevance for therapeutic intervention in celiac disease (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 14-15).  \n\nPrevious Use:  \nIn previous research, similar epithelial cell models, including Caco-2 cells and patient-derived intestinal organoids, have been effectively used to model key aspects of celiac disease pathogenesis. Studies have measured caspase-3/7 activity as an endpoint to assess epithelial stress and death following exposure to gliadin peptides and pro-inflammatory cytokines (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 2-4). Furthermore, assays focused on apoptotic activity have provided essential mechanistic insights into how gliadin influences epithelial cell viability, thereby validating apoptosis as a pathogenic endpoint and a suitable target for drug screening. The readouts from these assays, including the fluorogenic detection of caspase activity, played a role in elucidating pathways that contribute to enterocyte injury, further solidifying the assay’s utility in early-stage drug discovery (manai2018theinvitro pages 13-15).  \n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct measurement of a fundamental pathological process in celiac disease and its capacity for high-throughput screening due to the rapid quantification of caspase-3/7 activity. The use of both Caco-2 cells and patient-derived organoids offers flexibility, allowing researchers to perform screening in a reproducible cell line with the possibility of validating findings in a clinically relevant human tissue model (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 2-3). This dual approach helps bridge the gap between reductionist in vitro assays and more complex tissue responses, thereby enhancing the translational potential of the discovery pipeline.  \nHowever, limitations exist. For instance, while apoptosis is a key endpoint, celiac disease pathogenesis also involves pyroptotic and necroptotic mechanisms as well as barrier dysfunction that may not be fully captured by a caspase-3/7 assay alone (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 10-12). There is also the concern that in some patient-derived organoid models, baseline apoptosis is not markedly elevated, suggesting that additional readouts such as barrier integrity or inflammatory cytokine profiles may need to be incorporated to provide a more comprehensive evaluation (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 8-9). Overall, the assay presents a robust platform for assessing compounds aimed at halting epithelial apoptosis, a validated and critical endpoint in celiac disease, but it should ideally be complemented with additional endpoints to account for the multifaceted nature of the disease pathology (gagliardi2021gutexvivosystemas pages 4-7).', 'index': '3'}","{'hypothesis': 'NF-κB Signaling Suppression', 'answer': ""Assay Overview:  \nThe proposed assay employs Caco‑2 or HT‑29 cells that have been stably transfected with an NF‑κB luciferase reporter construct.

In genetically predisposed individuals (e.g., those with HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 alleles), gliadin peptides cross the intestinal barrier via trans- and paracellular routes (zanoletti2024entericglialcells pages 12-15) and undergo deamidation by type 2 transglutaminase (TG2), amplifying their immunogenicity (paolella2022type2transglutaminase pages 15-17).

By targeting the enzymatic activity of TG2, the assay directly models a critical pathological process—gluten peptide modification—that underlies the autoimmune cascade in celiac disease (Bako2016characterizingtg2autoantibody pages 30-33, OpenTargets Search: Celiac Disease-TGM2). The physiologically relevant Caco-2 model, combined with the sensitive 5-BP probe under calcium-rich conditions, recapitulates the environment in which these pathological modifications occur in vivo (Isola2023theoraltransglutaminase pages 5-7, kim2019tissuestressand pages 24-28).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nCell-based assays using Caco-2 monolayers and fluorescent TG2 activity probes have been employed in drug discovery contexts to identify and quantify inhibitors of TG2. Previous studies have demonstrated that the 5-BP probe, when used in these cell-based systems, provides a direct measure of TG2-mediated transamidation and deamidation. Important scientific findings include the validation of first-in-class TG2 inhibitors, which showed significant reduction in probe incorporation, thereby confirming their inhibitory potential. These assays have also aided in elucidating the calcium dependency and substrate specificity of TG2, supporting their utility in screening and optimizing candidate therapeutics (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 35-39, isola2023theoraltransglutaminase pages 5-7).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its high-throughput capability, the use of a physiologically meaningful cell model (Caco-2), and a direct fluorescent readout that reflects both transamidation and deamidation activities of TG2. This setup mirrors the biological conditions encountered in the intestinal lumen of celiac patients, providing translational insight into how a compound might perform in vivo. Additionally, this assay format has a track record of being useful in early-stage drug discovery, offering rapid screening and quantitative measure of compound efficacy against TG2 activity (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 32-35, kim2019tissuestressand pages 24-28).  \n\nHowever, there are potential limitations. Variability in TG2 expression or activation state in Caco-2 cells may not fully recapitulate the complex in vivo intestinal microenvironment, where additional factors (e.g., immune cell interactions, extracellular matrix components) modulate disease progression. Moreover, the assay’s reliance on a single enzyme activity measure might overlook other downstream immunological events essential to celiac disease pathology. Further validation with complementary immunological and in vivo models would be necessary to fully establish therapeutic potential (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 127-133, isola2023theoraltransglutaminase pages 5-7).  \n\nIn conclusion, the proposed cell-based fluorescent TG2 inhibition assay is a robust and scientifically sound platform for early-stage screening of potential celiac disease therapeutics, with clear biomedical and translational relevance despite some inherent limitations that warrant supplementary studies.', 'index': '0'}","{'hypothesis': 'T-cell Activation Suppression', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay utilizes a co-culture of deamidated gliadin-loaded, HLA-DQ2-positive antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with gluten-specific CD4+ T-cell hybridomas. The design specifically models the antigen presentation step that drives the aberrant T-cell activation seen in celiac disease (CeD). In this setup, the APCs, which may be professional cells (e.g., B cells) or engineered cell lines expressing HLA-DQ2 molecules, are pulsed with deamidated gliadin peptides—key immunogenic moieties generated by tissue transglutaminase (TG2)-mediated deamidation. Gluten-specific CD4+ T cells, derived from patient samples or as hybridomas, are then introduced. The primary measurement is the quantification of interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion using an ELISA, which functions as a proxy for T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement and activation (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 49-52, petersen2020tcellreceptor pages 17-20).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease pathogenesis is driven by an abnormal immune response initiated by deamidated gliadin peptides that are selectively presented by HLA-DQ2 (and HLA-DQ8) molecules, thus activating gluten-specific CD4+ T cells. This activation leads to intestinal mucosal inflammation and villous atrophy (buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12). The assay directly recapitulates this critical interaction by mimicking deamidated gliadin presentation and subsequent T-cell activation. Clinically, increased IL-2 levels have been observed post-gluten challenge in CeD patients, correlating with disease activity. This underlines the importance of IL-2 as a readout in the assay, making it an accurate marker for the immune events that occur in CeD (NCT03409796, NCT03738475).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nAssays employing co-culture systems with HLA-DQ2-positive APCs and gluten-specific T cells have a robust history in drug discovery for CeD. They have been instrumental in defining the sensitivity of T cells to specific deamidated gliadin epitopes and in evaluating the efficacy of immunotherapeutic candidates. For instance, research using similar setups measured T-cell activation via IL-2 secretion to assess the potency of novel interventions such as high-affinity TCR-like antibodies and peptide-based immunomodulatory agents (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 12-15, frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 15-18). Additionally, studies with Nexvax2 and other candidate compounds have harnessed antigen-specific T-cell assays detailing reduction in T-cell responses as a biomarker of potential therapeutic effectiveness (petersen2020tcellreceptor pages 17-20). Thus, the literature supports the utility of this approach in identifying drugs that can block or modulate the driving immunopathogenic interactions of CeD (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 252-255).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct relevance to the central events of CeD pathogenesis—antigen presentation and T-cell activation—providing a clear, quantifiable endpoint via IL-2 secretion. The use of a defined antigen (deamidated gliadin) and the inclusion of HLA-DQ2-positive APCs ensure disease specificity and high physiological relevance. Furthermore, the assay’s quantitative nature facilitates robust comparisons of drug efficacy and supports reproducibility across studies (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 49-52).\n\nHowever, there are also weaknesses and limitations. The in vitro model may not fully capture the complexity of the in vivo intestinal environment, including contributions from other immune cell types (e.g., B cells, dendritic cells) and the influence of gut microbiota. Moreover, reliance solely on IL-2 as an activation readout might overlook other relevant cytokine and chemokine cascades that contribute to CeD pathology. Integrating additional readouts, such as IFN-γ and T-cell proliferation markers, could provide a more comprehensive assessment of drug effects. Despite these limitations, the assay is scientifically sound, cost‐effective, and aligns well with current drug discovery strategies targeting T-cell mediated inflammation in celiac disease (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 265-266, buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12).\n\nIn summary, the co-culture T-cell activation suppression assay represents a robust platform for early-stage therapeutic screening in celiac disease, directly addressing a central mechanism of disease pathogenesis and offering a quantitative readout to evaluate potential interventions.', 'index': '7'}"
"(Gliadin Uptake Inhibition, 5)","(Gliadin Modification Profiling, 9)","Both assays target critical early pathways in celiac disease pathogenesis in vitro, yet they differ in complexity, throughput, and direct functional outputs. Candidate 1 (Gliadin Uptake Inhibition) uses fluorescently labeled immunodominant gliadin peptides and measures peptide internalization into IECs or HLA-DQ2+ B cells via flow cytometry or high-content imaging. This assay is simple to implement in a standard lab, offers high throughput, rapid kinetic readouts, and directly quantifies a functional endpoint—gliadin entry—that is required for downstream deamidation and T cell activation. It faithfully recapitulates a pathogenic event and can dissect receptor-mediated versus non-receptor pathways. Although it lacks the full cellular complexity of the gut mucosa, it provides a robust early-stage screening platform. Candidate 2 (Gliadin Modification Profiling) employs LC-MS/MS peptidomics to quantify TG2-mediated deamidation and cross-linking of gliadin peptides in cell culture supernatants. This method offers high molecular specificity and precise quantification of immunogenic peptide epitopes—directly measuring the biochemical event that drives HLA-DQ2/8-mediated T cell activation. However, LC-MS/MS workflows are technically demanding, lower in throughput, require extensive sample preparation and rigorous standardization, and yield longer turnaround times. While it excels in analytical resolution, its complexity limits rapid screening and may introduce variability in cell-based TG2 activity.","Given the preference for in vitro assays that emphasize simplicity, speed, biological relevance, and direct functional readouts suitable for high-throughput early-stage drug screening, Candidate 1 (Gliadin Uptake Inhibition) outperforms Candidate 2. The uptake assay is straightforward to implement on standard fluorescence imaging or flow cytometry platforms, provides immediate quantitative measures of a key pathogenic event, and supports rapid compound triage. In contrast, the LC-MS/MS profiling assay, while highly specific, is resource-intensive, slower, and less amenable to large-scale screening without substantial assay optimization. Thus, the uptake inhibition assay aligns better with practical screening requirements and biological relevance in early drug discovery.",23,"(5, 9)","{'hypothesis': 'Gliadin Uptake Inhibition', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThe proposed assay employs fluorescently labeled immunodominant gliadin peptides—specifically the 33-mer peptide—and measures their internalization into cell types relevant to celiac disease pathology. The assay models the initial step of antigen entry into the gut epithelium by targeting the endocytic uptake of gliadin. Measurements are principally obtained through flow cytometry or high-content imaging, which quantitatively assess the degree of gliadin internalization in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) or HLA-DQ2–expressing B cells. The use of IECs mimics the primary site of gliadin peptide interaction in the small intestine, while HLA-DQ2–expressing B cells provide a model for antigen presentation pivotal to the immune cascade in celiac disease (branchi2018theroleof pages 68-72). Fluorescent labeling facilitates high-throughput screening and kinetic analysis of compound efficacy in inhibiting gliadin uptake.\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nGliadin peptide uptake represents a critical pathogenic event in celiac disease that triggers downstream immune responses. In genetically predisposed individuals (e.g., those with HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 alleles), gliadin peptides cross the intestinal barrier via trans- and paracellular routes (zanoletti2024entericglialcells pages 12-15) and undergo deamidation by type 2 transglutaminase (TG2), amplifying their immunogenicity (paolella2022type2transglutaminase pages 15-17). Moreover, abnormal uptake through endocytosis or retrotranscytosis mediated by IgA or CD71 further exacerbates the immune response (branchi2018theroleof pages 68-72). Clinically, these events relate to increased intestinal permeability, inflammatory cytokine release, and immune cell activation, justifying an assay that evaluates the inhibition of gliadin entry into cells (valitutti2019breakingdownbarriers pages 8-9, castillo2015thepresentand pages 1-2). Thus, by specifically targeting the internalization of immunodominant gliadin peptides, this assay addresses the initial trigger of celiac pathogenesis, offering a mechanistic platform for therapeutic discovery.\n\nPrevious Use:  \nGliadin uptake assays have been employed in studies to elucidate the cellular pathways of gliadin translocation and in the evaluation of compounds aimed at reducing gliadin-induced toxicity. Previous research has demonstrated that blocking gliadin peptide uptake can interfere with subsequent TG2-mediated deamidation and T cell activation (buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 27-28, castillo2015thepresentand pages 6-6). Fluorescent-based methods have previously been applied to track the kinetics and pathways of gliadin peptide internalization, providing critical insights into the role of endocytosis, autophagy, and paracellular transport in disease progression (manai2018theinvitro pages 13-15). Such assays have also helped in evaluating drug candidates like tight junction modulators, probiotics, and glutenases, which aim to prevent gliadin peptide entry or enhance its degradation before an immune response can be mounted (buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12, galipeau2015exploringnovelmechanisms pages 206-210).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the assay include its mechanistic specificity in targeting the early events of antigen uptake, high-throughput capability via fluorescence-based methods, and direct relevance to the pathogenic cascade of celiac disease. By quantifying changes in internalization rates, the assay can immediately inform on the efficacy of drug candidates that block critical uptake routes for gliadin, which is a well-validated therapeutic target (branchi2018theroleof pages 68-72, zanoletti2024entericglialcells pages 12-15). It also allows for the dissection of differences between receptor-mediated and non-receptor mediated uptake, an important consideration given the heterogeneity of gliadin pathways (paolella2022type2transglutaminase pages 23-25).  \n\nHowever, weaknesses include the challenge of faithfully recapitulating the complexity of in vivo intestinal barrier physiology in vitro.

In this setting, gliadin peptides—especially those known to be immunogenic such as the 33-mer—are incubated with TG2 in the presence and absence of candidate inhibitors. LC-MS/MS is then applied to the cell culture supernatants to measure the levels of deamidated and cross-linked peptide species. This assay models a critical step in celiac disease (CD) pathogenesis, where TG2-mediated modifications enhance gliadin peptide immunogenicity, leading to T cell activation via binding to HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules. The approach relies on using biologically relevant substrates (gliadin peptides) and, optimally, gut epithelial cell cultures or cell lysates that more accurately recapitulate the enzyme’s behavior in the small intestine (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 10-11, alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease is primarily driven by the enzymatic activity of TG2, which converts gliadin peptides into more immunogenic forms through deamidation and cross-linking. The generation of these modified gliadin epitopes is fundamental to the pathogenesis of CD because they bind with increased affinity to HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 molecules, thereby activating pathogenic CD4+ T cells and precipitating the inflammatory cascade associated with intestinal damage (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183, buchold2022featuresofzed1227 pages 2-3). Clinical observations further support this model, given that alterations in TG2 expression and activity correlate with disease activity, and serological markers such as anti-TG2 antibodies serve as reliable diagnostic indicators (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 4-5).

LC-MS/MS-based profiling provides direct quantification of deamidated and cross-linked products, offering precise measurements of target engagement by inhibitors. This level of detail is critical for early-stage drug discovery, as it links biochemical modifications directly with pathogenic epitope formation. Additionally, by employing biologically relevant substrates and cell culture models that mirror gut epithelial cell behavior, the assay offers an in vitro platform that is pathophysiologically relevant (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 10-11, alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183).\n\nHowever, there are potential weaknesses.

However, weaknesses include the inherent limitations of in vitro models; they may not fully recapitulate the complex interplay between epithelial cells, immune components, and the intestinal microbiota, which are crucial in celiac disease.

LC-MS/MS is then applied to the cell culture supernatants to measure the levels of deamidated and cross-linked peptide species. This assay models a critical step in celiac disease (CD) pathogenesis, where TG2-mediated modifications enhance gliadin peptide immunogenicity, leading to T cell activation via binding to HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules. The approach relies on using biologically relevant substrates (gliadin peptides) and, optimally, gut epithelial cell cultures or cell lysates that more accurately recapitulate the enzyme’s behavior in the small intestine (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 10-11, alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease is primarily driven by the enzymatic activity of TG2, which converts gliadin peptides into more immunogenic forms through deamidation and cross-linking. The generation of these modified gliadin epitopes is fundamental to the pathogenesis of CD because they bind with increased affinity to HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 molecules, thereby activating pathogenic CD4+ T cells and precipitating the inflammatory cascade associated with intestinal damage (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183, buchold2022featuresofzed1227 pages 2-3).

The assay is conducted under calcium‐rich conditions to promote TG2 activation, reflecting the lumenal environment where gluten peptides encounter TG2. Measurements are taken via rapid microplate fluorescence detection, allowing high-throughput screening of small molecules that inhibit TG2 activity (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 32-35, kim2019tissuestressand pages 24-28).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nTG2 (transglutaminase 2) plays a central mechanistic role in celiac disease pathogenesis by deamidating gliadin peptides. This modification increases peptide affinity for HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, key genetic risk factors that drive a pathogenic T cell–mediated immune response in celiac patients.

Important scientific findings include the validation of first-in-class TG2 inhibitors, which showed significant reduction in probe incorporation, thereby confirming their inhibitory potential.

In this assay, differentiated enterocyte monolayers are treated with gliadin peptides to mimic the condition observed in celiac disease patients. FITC-dextran, a fluorescent tracer of a defined molecular weight (typically 4\u202fkDa), is then added to the apical side of the monolayer.

This output allows researchers to directly measure the impact of candidate therapeutic compounds on NF‑κB activation with high sensitivity and throughput (yu2022thenutritionalintervention pages 9-10).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nNF‑κB signaling plays a central role in the initiation and propagation of inflammation in celiac disease, as gliadin peptides trigger NF‑κB activation that results in the secretion of pro‑inflammatory cytokines and contributes to mucosal damage. The involvement of NF‑κB in mediating immune and oxidative stress responses has been consistently documented in both biomedical and clinical studies. For instance, resveratrol studies have shown that suppression of NF‑κB can ameliorate gut inflammation in celiac disease models, underscoring the mechanistic relevance of the pathway in disease progression (yu2022thenutritionalintervention pages 1-2).

Second, while NF‑κB signaling is an important mediator of inflammation, celiac disease pathogenesis is multifactorial and involves adaptive immune responses and additional pathways such as those involving FLT3 and ATG16L1, which may be underrepresented in a single‑readout assay (OpenTargets Search: celiac disease-NFKB1,NFKB2,RELA,RELB,RELC).

This assay models a critical step in celiac disease (CD) pathogenesis, where TG2-mediated modifications enhance gliadin peptide immunogenicity, leading to T cell activation via binding to HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules. The approach relies on using biologically relevant substrates (gliadin peptides) and, optimally, gut epithelial cell cultures or cell lysates that more accurately recapitulate the enzyme’s behavior in the small intestine (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 10-11, alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease is primarily driven by the enzymatic activity of TG2, which converts gliadin peptides into more immunogenic forms through deamidation and cross-linking. The generation of these modified gliadin epitopes is fundamental to the pathogenesis of CD because they bind with increased affinity to HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 molecules, thereby activating pathogenic CD4+ T cells and precipitating the inflammatory cascade associated with intestinal damage (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183, buchold2022featuresofzed1227 pages 2-3). Clinical observations further support this model, given that alterations in TG2 expression and activity correlate with disease activity, and serological markers such as anti-TG2 antibodies serve as reliable diagnostic indicators (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 4-5). Moreover, the translational success of TG2 inhibitors in preclinical models underlines the clinical importance of directly targeting this biochemical pathway (wichka2024rapiddiscoveryof pages 1-2).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nAssays designed to quantify TG2-mediated deamidation are not entirely new. Initial studies have applied fluorescence-based assays, for example, monitoring ammonia release as a surrogate marker for deamidation activity on gliadin and other substrates (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 173-177, pages 180-183). More recently, LC-MS/MS platforms have been integrated into these studies to provide direct chemical characterization of gliadin modifications, overcoming the limitations of antibody-based detection methods and offering high sensitivity and specificity in profiling pathogenic epitopes (alves2017determinationofgluten pages 6-8, palanski2022anefficienturine pages 1-4). This evolution in assay design has led to improved evaluation of inhibitor potency, target engagement, and a more nuanced understanding of the molecular events that drive CD pathogenesis (buchold2022featuresofzed1227 pages 11-13).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its molecular specificity and the capacity to dissect enzymatic modifications with high resolution. LC-MS/MS-based profiling provides direct quantification of deamidated and cross-linked products, offering precise measurements of target engagement by inhibitors. This level of detail is critical for early-stage drug discovery, as it links biochemical modifications directly with pathogenic epitope formation. Additionally, by employing biologically relevant substrates and cell culture models that mirror gut epithelial cell behavior, the assay offers an in vitro platform that is pathophysiologically relevant (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 10-11, alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183).\n\nHowever, there are potential weaknesses. The complexity of LC-MS/MS may introduce challenges in assay standardization and reproducibility, particularly regarding sample preparation from cell culture supernatants. Variability in enzyme activity in cell systems compared to purified systems may also complicate the interpretation of inhibitor efficacy. Furthermore, while the assay exerts excellent analytical precision, additional in vivo or ex vivo validation might be necessary to confirm that changes observed in peptide modifications translate into meaningful clinical outcomes (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183, buchold2022featuresofzed1227 pages 11-13).\n\nIn summary, the LC-MS/MS-based gliadin modification profiling assay is a scientifically sound and highly specific approach. It effectively models a central biochemical event in CD and is well-suited for early-stage drug discovery—even though attention to assay optimization and biological variability will be vital to its successful application.', 'index': '9'}"
"(""TG2 Enzymatic Inhibition"", 0)","(""Gliadin Uptake Inhibition"", 5)","Both assays address key steps in celiac pathogenesis but differ in scope, throughput, and simplicity. Candidate 1 (TG2 Enzymatic Inhibition) directly measures the enzymatic deamidation and transamidation of gliadin peptides by TG2 using a well-characterized fluorescent probe (5-BP) in Caco-2 monolayers under calcium-rich conditions. This cell-based microplate fluorescence assay is high-throughput, simple to implement in standard labs, and provides a quantitative functional endpoint closely tied to the central pathogenic mechanism of celiac disease (gliadin deamidation promoting HLA-DQ2/8 binding).

Candidate 2 (Gliadin Uptake Inhibition) measures the internalization of fluorescent 33-mer gliadin peptides via flow cytometry or high-content imaging in IECs and HLA-DQ2 B cells. While it targets an upstream event—antigen uptake—it is more complex, requiring dual cell-type handling, peptide labeling, and specialized instrumentation.

The main readout is based on the incorporation of a fluorescent activity probe (5‐biotinamidopentylamine, 5‐BP) into TG2 substrates, which quantitatively reports on the enzyme’s deamidation and transamidation activity, particularly on gliadin peptides. The assay is conducted under calcium‐rich conditions to promote TG2 activation, reflecting the lumenal environment where gluten peptides encounter TG2.

This modification increases peptide affinity for HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, key genetic risk factors that drive a pathogenic T cell–mediated immune response in celiac patients. Clinically, elevated TG2 autoantibodies and increased TG2 activity in the intestinal mucosa are hallmark features of celiac disease, underscoring the enzyme’s centrality in disease progression. By targeting the enzymatic activity of TG2, the assay directly models a critical pathological process—gluten peptide modification—that underlies the autoimmune cascade in celiac disease (Bako2016characterizingtg2autoantibody pages 30-33, OpenTargets Search: Celiac Disease-TGM2). The physiologically relevant Caco-2 model, combined with the sensitive 5-BP probe under calcium-rich conditions, recapitulates the environment in which these pathological modifications occur in vivo (Isola2023theoraltransglutaminase pages 5-7, kim2019tissuestressand pages 24-28).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nCell-based assays using Caco-2 monolayers and fluorescent TG2 activity probes have been employed in drug discovery contexts to identify and quantify inhibitors of TG2. Previous studies have demonstrated that the 5-BP probe, when used in these cell-based systems, provides a direct measure of TG2-mediated transamidation and deamidation. Important scientific findings include the validation of first-in-class TG2 inhibitors, which showed significant reduction in probe incorporation, thereby confirming their inhibitory potential. These assays have also aided in elucidating the calcium dependency and substrate specificity of TG2, supporting their utility in screening and optimizing candidate therapeutics (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 35-39, isola2023theoraltransglutaminase pages 5-7).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its high-throughput capability, the use of a physiologically meaningful cell model (Caco-2), and a direct fluorescent readout that reflects both transamidation and deamidation activities of TG2.

Additionally, this assay format has a track record of being useful in early-stage drug discovery, offering rapid screening and quantitative measure of compound efficacy against TG2 activity (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 32-35, kim2019tissuestressand pages 24-28).  \n\nHowever, there are potential limitations. Variability in TG2 expression or activation state in Caco-2 cells may not fully recapitulate the complex in vivo intestinal microenvironment, where additional factors (e.g., immune cell interactions, extracellular matrix components) modulate disease progression. Moreover, the assay’s reliance on a single enzyme activity measure might overlook other downstream immunological events essential to celiac disease pathology. Further validation with complementary immunological and in vivo models would be necessary to fully establish therapeutic potential (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 127-133, isola2023theoraltransglutaminase pages 5-7).  \n\nIn conclusion, the proposed cell-based fluorescent TG2 inhibition assay is a robust and scientifically sound platform for early-stage screening of potential celiac disease therapeutics, with clear biomedical and translational relevance despite some inherent limitations that warrant supplementary studies.', 'index': '0'}","{'hypothesis': 'Gliadin Uptake Inhibition', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThe proposed assay employs fluorescently labeled immunodominant gliadin peptides—specifically the 33-mer peptide—and measures their internalization into cell types relevant to celiac disease pathology.

Measurements are principally obtained through flow cytometry or high-content imaging, which quantitatively assess the degree of gliadin internalization in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) or HLA-DQ2–expressing B cells.

Gliadin is known to initiate zonulin release, which in turn disrupts tight junction proteins (e.g., claudins, occludins, ZO proteins) leading to increased paracellular permeability—a central event in celiac disease pathogenesis. The assay technique is label‐free and offers a real‐time quantitative readout of tight junction integrity by measuring TEER before and after gliadin exposure, thereby simulating the zonulin-mediated barrier dysfunction observed in patients (binienda2020dietarycarbohydratesand pages 1-3, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 12-13).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease is characterized by an abnormal immune response following gliadin ingestion, which induces zonulin release and subsequent disassembly of tight junctions. This chain of events increases intestinal permeability and permits gliadin peptides to translocate the epithelium, triggering inflammation and immune activation. Both biomedical and clinical literature underscore the importance of this barrier dysfunction in disease pathogenesis. Specifically, tight junction disruption is pivotal in initiating and sustaining the inflammatory cascade in celiac disease, and TEER decline is a reliable proxy for assessing this disruption in vitro. The underlying mechanisms—primarily zonulin-mediated modulation of tight junctions—are well-documented, lending strong support to the use of this assay to model critical steps of celiac disease pathology (binienda2020dietarycarbohydratesand pages 11-13, aleman2023leakygutand pages 8-9, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 13-14).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nTEER assays with gliadin-challenged Caco-2 or T84 monolayers have been extensively exploited in early-stage drug screening.

Key studies have demonstrated that candidate therapeutics capable of mitigating gliadin-induced TEER decline successfully restore barrier integrity and might translate into beneficial clinical outcomes. This assay has thus played a significant role in de-risking drug candidates in pre-clinical pipelines by providing mechanistic insights into barrier protection strategies (binienda2020dietarycarbohydratesand pages 1-3, aleman2023leakygutand pages 1-3, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 12-13).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nA major strength of the TEER assay is its ability to deliver real-time, quantitative, and reproducible data on barrier integrity in a controlled in vitro environment.

The label-free nature of the assay minimizes interference and allows for direct measurement of tight junction function. This makes it a valuable tool for screening potential therapeutics and understanding the underlying biological mechanisms of gut barrier dysfunction (lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 13-14, aleman2023leakygutand pages 8-9).\n\nNonetheless, there are inherent weaknesses. The use of cancer-derived cell lines such as Caco-2 and T84, while convenient and widely established, cannot fully capture the complexity of human intestinal tissue—lacking aspects such as cell-type diversity, immune interactions, and the three-dimensional architecture of the gut. These limitations may affect the assay’s translational predictability. Recent literature advocates for complementary use of advanced models such as intestinal organoids, which better recapitulate the native tissue microenvironment, despite their increased complexity and cost (lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 3-5, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 6-7).\n\nOverall, TEER-based assays following a gliadin challenge offer a robust, mechanistic platform for evaluating barrier-protective therapeutics in celiac disease.

The multiplex technique enables simultaneous detection of multiple cytokine mediators from the culture supernatant, thereby providing a systems-level view of the inflammatory response elicited by gliadin in this in vitro model (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 13-13).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe inflammatory process in celiac disease is driven by gliadin-induced immune activation, which involves the production of key cytokines like IL-15 and IFN-γ. IL-15, in particular, is critical as it not only activates intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) but also disrupts the balance of regulatory T cell functions, thereby contributing significantly to tissue damage observed in active celiac disease (bendvold2013theroleof pages 55-58, musaico2020studyofbiochemical pages 43-46).

It directly quantifies a core pathological process—enterocyte death—that contributes to villous atrophy and barrier loss. The assay is high-throughput, rapid, and adaptable to standard lab settings. However, epithelial apoptosis is only one facet of CeD pathology. The assay does not capture antigen presentation, immune cell interactions, or barrier integrity per se, and may require supplemental endpoints for full mechanistic clarity. Baseline apoptosis in organoids can be low, potentially limiting signal window without strong inflammatory stimulation. Candidate 2 (T-cell Activation Suppression) models the HLA-DQ2–mediated presentation of deamidated gliadin to gluten-specific CD4+ T cells in co-culture, measuring IL-2 secretion by ELISA. This directly recapitulates the initiating immunopathogenic event in CeD and is highly disease-specific. The assay has been validated in multiple studies, provides a quantitative and reproducible endpoint, and assesses the core immune mechanism that drives mucosal injury. While the co-culture is more complex than a monoculture of epithelial cells and relies on specialized APCs and T cells, the readout (ELISA) is routine. It may miss secondary cytokines unless multiplexed, but as a primary screen for immune modulation it is highly relevant.","While both assays offer functional readouts tied to CeD pathology, the T-cell activation suppression assay (Candidate 2) better aligns with the central immunological mechanism of CeD—HLA-DQ2-restricted presentation of deamidated gliadin to CD4+ T cells—and has extensive precedent in drug screening. It provides disease specificity that apoptosis assays cannot match, directly measures the therapeutic effect on T-cell activation, and uses robust, standard ELISA endpoints.

In this approach, intestinal epithelial cells—either a transformed cell line such as Caco-2 or patient-derived intestinal organoids—are exposed to gliadin peptides along with pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFNγ, TNFα). These stimuli simulate the inflammatory milieu and gliadin-induced cellular stress observed in the small intestinal mucosa of untreated celiac disease patients. Fluorogenic substrates that become cleaved by active caspase-3/7 produce a measurable fluorescence signal, which serves as a rapid and quantitative readout of apoptosis. This readout directly reflects the degree of enterocyte death and, subsequently, the protective effect of drugs targeting these pathways (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 4-5).  \n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nEpithelial apoptosis is a central pathological event in celiac disease, contributing significantly to villous atrophy and compromised barrier function. The inflammatory cytokines and gliadin peptides are shown to induce both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in enterocytes, leading to caspase-3 activation, a pivotal step in programmed cell death (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 5-7). Moreover, additional studies have demonstrated that increased expression of apoptotic markers in intestinal biopsies of untreated celiac patients is closely associated with mucosal injury (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 1-2). These findings are corroborated by clinical evidence showing that targeting apoptosis might improve epithelial integrity, reinstate effective barrier function, and ultimately influence disease progression. Thus, preventing apoptosis is not only a central mechanistic target but also holds translational relevance for therapeutic intervention in celiac disease (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 14-15).  \n\nPrevious Use:  \nIn previous research, similar epithelial cell models, including Caco-2 cells and patient-derived intestinal organoids, have been effectively used to model key aspects of celiac disease pathogenesis. Studies have measured caspase-3/7 activity as an endpoint to assess epithelial stress and death following exposure to gliadin peptides and pro-inflammatory cytokines (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 2-4). Furthermore, assays focused on apoptotic activity have provided essential mechanistic insights into how gliadin influences epithelial cell viability, thereby validating apoptosis as a pathogenic endpoint and a suitable target for drug screening. The readouts from these assays, including the fluorogenic detection of caspase activity, played a role in elucidating pathways that contribute to enterocyte injury, further solidifying the assay’s utility in early-stage drug discovery (manai2018theinvitro pages 13-15).  \n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct measurement of a fundamental pathological process in celiac disease and its capacity for high-throughput screening due to the rapid quantification of caspase-3/7 activity. The use of both Caco-2 cells and patient-derived organoids offers flexibility, allowing researchers to perform screening in a reproducible cell line with the possibility of validating findings in a clinically relevant human tissue model (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 2-3). This dual approach helps bridge the gap between reductionist in vitro assays and more complex tissue responses, thereby enhancing the translational potential of the discovery pipeline.  \nHowever, limitations exist. For instance, while apoptosis is a key endpoint, celiac disease pathogenesis also involves pyroptotic and necroptotic mechanisms as well as barrier dysfunction that may not be fully captured by a caspase-3/7 assay alone (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 10-12). There is also the concern that in some patient-derived organoid models, baseline apoptosis is not markedly elevated, suggesting that additional readouts such as barrier integrity or inflammatory cytokine profiles may need to be incorporated to provide a more comprehensive evaluation (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 8-9).

The design specifically models the antigen presentation step that drives the aberrant T-cell activation seen in celiac disease (CeD). In this setup, the APCs, which may be professional cells (e.g., B cells) or engineered cell lines expressing HLA-DQ2 molecules, are pulsed with deamidated gliadin peptides—key immunogenic moieties generated by tissue transglutaminase (TG2)-mediated deamidation. Gluten-specific CD4+ T cells, derived from patient samples or as hybridomas, are then introduced. The primary measurement is the quantification of interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion using an ELISA, which functions as a proxy for T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement and activation (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 49-52, petersen2020tcellreceptor pages 17-20).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease pathogenesis is driven by an abnormal immune response initiated by deamidated gliadin peptides that are selectively presented by HLA-DQ2 (and HLA-DQ8) molecules, thus activating gluten-specific CD4+ T cells. This activation leads to intestinal mucosal inflammation and villous atrophy (buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12). The assay directly recapitulates this critical interaction by mimicking deamidated gliadin presentation and subsequent T-cell activation. Clinically, increased IL-2 levels have been observed post-gluten challenge in CeD patients, correlating with disease activity. This underlines the importance of IL-2 as a readout in the assay, making it an accurate marker for the immune events that occur in CeD (NCT03409796, NCT03738475).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nAssays employing co-culture systems with HLA-DQ2-positive APCs and gluten-specific T cells have a robust history in drug discovery for CeD. They have been instrumental in defining the sensitivity of T cells to specific deamidated gliadin epitopes and in evaluating the efficacy of immunotherapeutic candidates. For instance, research using similar setups measured T-cell activation via IL-2 secretion to assess the potency of novel interventions such as high-affinity TCR-like antibodies and peptide-based immunomodulatory agents (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 12-15, frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 15-18). Additionally, studies with Nexvax2 and other candidate compounds have harnessed antigen-specific T-cell assays detailing reduction in T-cell responses as a biomarker of potential therapeutic effectiveness (petersen2020tcellreceptor pages 17-20). Thus, the literature supports the utility of this approach in identifying drugs that can block or modulate the driving immunopathogenic interactions of CeD (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 252-255).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct relevance to the central events of CeD pathogenesis—antigen presentation and T-cell activation—providing a clear, quantifiable endpoint via IL-2 secretion. The use of a defined antigen (deamidated gliadin) and the inclusion of HLA-DQ2-positive APCs ensure disease specificity and high physiological relevance. Furthermore, the assay’s quantitative nature facilitates robust comparisons of drug efficacy and supports reproducibility across studies (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 49-52).\n\nHowever, there are also weaknesses and limitations. The in vitro model may not fully capture the complexity of the in vivo intestinal environment, including contributions from other immune cell types (e.g., B cells, dendritic cells) and the influence of gut microbiota. Moreover, reliance solely on IL-2 as an activation readout might overlook other relevant cytokine and chemokine cascades that contribute to CeD pathology. Integrating additional readouts, such as IFN-γ and T-cell proliferation markers, could provide a more comprehensive assessment of drug effects. Despite these limitations, the assay is scientifically sound, cost‐effective, and aligns well with current drug discovery strategies targeting T-cell mediated inflammation in celiac disease (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 265-266, buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12).\n\nIn summary, the co-culture T-cell activation suppression assay represents a robust platform for early-stage therapeutic screening in celiac disease, directly addressing a central mechanism of disease pathogenesis and offering a quantitative readout to evaluate potential interventions.', 'index': '7'}"

LC-MS/MS is then applied to the cell culture supernatants to measure the levels of deamidated and cross-linked peptide species. This assay models a critical step in celiac disease (CD) pathogenesis, where TG2-mediated modifications enhance gliadin peptide immunogenicity, leading to T cell activation via binding to HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules. The approach relies on using biologically relevant substrates (gliadin peptides) and, optimally, gut epithelial cell cultures or cell lysates that more accurately recapitulate the enzyme’s behavior in the small intestine (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 10-11, alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease is primarily driven by the enzymatic activity of TG2, which converts gliadin peptides into more immunogenic forms through deamidation and cross-linking. The generation of these modified gliadin epitopes is fundamental to the pathogenesis of CD because they bind with increased affinity to HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 molecules, thereby activating pathogenic CD4+ T cells and precipitating the inflammatory cascade associated with intestinal damage (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183, buchold2022featuresofzed1227 pages 2-3).

This level of detail is critical for early-stage drug discovery, as it links biochemical modifications directly with pathogenic epitope formation. Additionally, by employing biologically relevant substrates and cell culture models that mirror gut epithelial cell behavior, the assay offers an in vitro platform that is pathophysiologically relevant (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 10-11, alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183).\n\nHowever, there are potential weaknesses.

It is label‐free, quantitative, and relatively easy to implement in standard Transwell formats. The TEER decline upon gliadin challenge recapitulates zonulin‐mediated permeability changes central to celiac pathogenesis, and its reversal by candidate compounds directly reflects barrier‐protective activity.

The assay technique is label‐free and offers a real‐time quantitative readout of tight junction integrity by measuring TEER before and after gliadin exposure, thereby simulating the zonulin-mediated barrier dysfunction observed in patients (binienda2020dietarycarbohydratesand pages 1-3, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 12-13).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease is characterized by an abnormal immune response following gliadin ingestion, which induces zonulin release and subsequent disassembly of tight junctions.

Both biomedical and clinical literature underscore the importance of this barrier dysfunction in disease pathogenesis. Specifically, tight junction disruption is pivotal in initiating and sustaining the inflammatory cascade in celiac disease, and TEER decline is a reliable proxy for assessing this disruption in vitro. The underlying mechanisms—primarily zonulin-mediated modulation of tight junctions—are well-documented, lending strong support to the use of this assay to model critical steps of celiac disease pathology (binienda2020dietarycarbohydratesand pages 11-13, aleman2023leakygutand pages 8-9, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 13-14).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nTEER assays with gliadin-challenged Caco-2 or T84 monolayers have been extensively exploited in early-stage drug screening.

The use of cancer-derived cell lines such as Caco-2 and T84, while convenient and widely established, cannot fully capture the complexity of human intestinal tissue—lacking aspects such as cell-type diversity, immune interactions, and the three-dimensional architecture of the gut. These limitations may affect the assay’s translational predictability.

The assay models the initial step of antigen entry into the gut epithelium by targeting the endocytic uptake of gliadin. Measurements are principally obtained through flow cytometry or high-content imaging, which quantitatively assess the degree of gliadin internalization in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) or HLA-DQ2–expressing B cells. The use of IECs mimics the primary site of gliadin peptide interaction in the small intestine, while HLA-DQ2–expressing B cells provide a model for antigen presentation pivotal to the immune cascade in celiac disease (branchi2018theroleof pages 68-72). Fluorescent labeling facilitates high-throughput screening and kinetic analysis of compound efficacy in inhibiting gliadin uptake.\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nGliadin peptide uptake represents a critical pathogenic event in celiac disease that triggers downstream immune responses. In genetically predisposed individuals (e.g., those with HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 alleles), gliadin peptides cross the intestinal barrier via trans- and paracellular routes (zanoletti2024entericglialcells pages 12-15) and undergo deamidation by type 2 transglutaminase (TG2), amplifying their immunogenicity (paolella2022type2transglutaminase pages 15-17). Moreover, abnormal uptake through endocytosis or retrotranscytosis mediated by IgA or CD71 further exacerbates the immune response (branchi2018theroleof pages 68-72). Clinically, these events relate to increased intestinal permeability, inflammatory cytokine release, and immune cell activation, justifying an assay that evaluates the inhibition of gliadin entry into cells (valitutti2019breakingdownbarriers pages 8-9, castillo2015thepresentand pages 1-2).

Fluorescent-based methods have previously been applied to track the kinetics and pathways of gliadin peptide internalization, providing critical insights into the role of endocytosis, autophagy, and paracellular transport in disease progression (manai2018theinvitro pages 13-15). Such assays have also helped in evaluating drug candidates like tight junction modulators, probiotics, and glutenases, which aim to prevent gliadin peptide entry or enhance its degradation before an immune response can be mounted (buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12, galipeau2015exploringnovelmechanisms pages 206-210).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the assay include its mechanistic specificity in targeting the early events of antigen uptake, high-throughput capability via fluorescence-based methods, and direct relevance to the pathogenic cascade of celiac disease. By quantifying changes in internalization rates, the assay can immediately inform on the efficacy of drug candidates that block critical uptake routes for gliadin, which is a well-validated therapeutic target (branchi2018theroleof pages 68-72, zanoletti2024entericglialcells pages 12-15). It also allows for the dissection of differences between receptor-mediated and non-receptor mediated uptake, an important consideration given the heterogeneity of gliadin pathways (paolella2022type2transglutaminase pages 23-25).  \n\nHowever, weaknesses include the challenge of faithfully recapitulating the complexity of in vivo intestinal barrier physiology in vitro.

While the NF-κB assay is sensitive and high-throughput for signaling, it measures an upstream inflammatory signal rather than the downstream functional consequence of gliadin exposure and may miss compounds that act on barrier restoration without directly modulating NF-κB.

For instance, resveratrol studies have shown that suppression of NF‑κB can ameliorate gut inflammation in celiac disease models, underscoring the mechanistic relevance of the pathway in disease progression (yu2022thenutritionalintervention pages 1-2).

Second, while NF‑κB signaling is an important mediator of inflammation, celiac disease pathogenesis is multifactorial and involves adaptive immune responses and additional pathways such as those involving FLT3 and ATG16L1, which may be underrepresented in a single‑readout assay (OpenTargets Search: celiac disease-NFKB1,NFKB2,RELA,RELB,RELC).

Gliadin is known to initiate zonulin release, which in turn disrupts tight junction proteins (e.g., claudins, occludins, ZO proteins) leading to increased paracellular permeability—a central event in celiac disease pathogenesis. The assay technique is label‐free and offers a real‐time quantitative readout of tight junction integrity by measuring TEER before and after gliadin exposure, thereby simulating the zonulin-mediated barrier dysfunction observed in patients (binienda2020dietarycarbohydratesand pages 1-3, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 12-13).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease is characterized by an abnormal immune response following gliadin ingestion, which induces zonulin release and subsequent disassembly of tight junctions. This chain of events increases intestinal permeability and permits gliadin peptides to translocate the epithelium, triggering inflammation and immune activation. Both biomedical and clinical literature underscore the importance of this barrier dysfunction in disease pathogenesis. Specifically, tight junction disruption is pivotal in initiating and sustaining the inflammatory cascade in celiac disease, and TEER decline is a reliable proxy for assessing this disruption in vitro. The underlying mechanisms—primarily zonulin-mediated modulation of tight junctions—are well-documented, lending strong support to the use of this assay to model critical steps of celiac disease pathology (binienda2020dietarycarbohydratesand pages 11-13, aleman2023leakygutand pages 8-9, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 13-14).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nTEER assays with gliadin-challenged Caco-2 or T84 monolayers have been extensively exploited in early-stage drug screening. They have been used to evaluate the efficacy of compounds such as larazotide acetate, which directly target zonulin-induced tight junction disassembly. Key studies have demonstrated that candidate therapeutics capable of mitigating gliadin-induced TEER decline successfully restore barrier integrity and might translate into beneficial clinical outcomes.

The use of cancer-derived cell lines such as Caco-2 and T84, while convenient and widely established, cannot fully capture the complexity of human intestinal tissue—lacking aspects such as cell-type diversity, immune interactions, and the three-dimensional architecture of the gut. These limitations may affect the assay’s translational predictability. Recent literature advocates for complementary use of advanced models such as intestinal organoids, which better recapitulate the native tissue microenvironment, despite their increased complexity and cost (lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 3-5, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 6-7).\n\nOverall, TEER-based assays following a gliadin challenge offer a robust, mechanistic platform for evaluating barrier-protective therapeutics in celiac disease.

In this setup, the APCs, which may be professional cells (e.g., B cells) or engineered cell lines expressing HLA-DQ2 molecules, are pulsed with deamidated gliadin peptides—key immunogenic moieties generated by tissue transglutaminase (TG2)-mediated deamidation. Gluten-specific CD4+ T cells, derived from patient samples or as hybridomas, are then introduced. The primary measurement is the quantification of interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion using an ELISA, which functions as a proxy for T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement and activation (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 49-52, petersen2020tcellreceptor pages 17-20).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease pathogenesis is driven by an abnormal immune response initiated by deamidated gliadin peptides that are selectively presented by HLA-DQ2 (and HLA-DQ8) molecules, thus activating gluten-specific CD4+ T cells.

The assay is conducted under calcium‐rich conditions to promote TG2 activation, reflecting the lumenal environment where gluten peptides encounter TG2.

This modification increases peptide affinity for HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, key genetic risk factors that drive a pathogenic T cell–mediated immune response in celiac patients. Clinically, elevated TG2 autoantibodies and increased TG2 activity in the intestinal mucosa are hallmark features of celiac disease, underscoring the enzyme’s centrality in disease progression. By targeting the enzymatic activity of TG2, the assay directly models a critical pathological process—gluten peptide modification—that underlies the autoimmune cascade in celiac disease (Bako2016characterizingtg2autoantibody pages 30-33, OpenTargets Search: Celiac Disease-TGM2). The physiologically relevant Caco-2 model, combined with the sensitive 5-BP probe under calcium-rich conditions, recapitulates the environment in which these pathological modifications occur in vivo (Isola2023theoraltransglutaminase pages 5-7, kim2019tissuestressand pages 24-28).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nCell-based assays using Caco-2 monolayers and fluorescent TG2 activity probes have been employed in drug discovery contexts to identify and quantify inhibitors of TG2. Previous studies have demonstrated that the 5-BP probe, when used in these cell-based systems, provides a direct measure of TG2-mediated transamidation and deamidation. Important scientific findings include the validation of first-in-class TG2 inhibitors, which showed significant reduction in probe incorporation, thereby confirming their inhibitory potential.

Additionally, this assay format has a track record of being useful in early-stage drug discovery, offering rapid screening and quantitative measure of compound efficacy against TG2 activity (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 32-35, kim2019tissuestressand pages 24-28).  \n\nHowever, there are potential limitations. Variability in TG2 expression or activation state in Caco-2 cells may not fully recapitulate the complex in vivo intestinal microenvironment, where additional factors (e.g., immune cell interactions, extracellular matrix components) modulate disease progression. Moreover, the assay’s reliance on a single enzyme activity measure might overlook other downstream immunological events essential to celiac disease pathology. Further validation with complementary immunological and in vivo models would be necessary to fully establish therapeutic potential (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 127-133, isola2023theoraltransglutaminase pages 5-7).  \n\nIn conclusion, the proposed cell-based fluorescent TG2 inhibition assay is a robust and scientifically sound platform for early-stage screening of potential celiac disease therapeutics, with clear biomedical and translational relevance despite some inherent limitations that warrant supplementary studies.', 'index': '0'}","{'hypothesis': 'Peptide–MHC Presentation Blockade', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis peptide–MHC presentation blockade assay is engineered to model the central event in celiac disease pathogenesis, namely the presentation of deamidated gliadin peptides by disease-associated HLA-DQ2 molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The assay uses fluorescent tetramers or conformation‐specific antibodies to detect complexes formed between deamidated gliadin peptides and HLA-DQ2; these complexes are quantified by flow cytometry. The readout is the surface density and frequency of peptide–MHC complexes on APCs, providing a direct measurement of peptide loading efficiency and inhibition in the presence of candidate compounds. The assay might be performed on cell lines or primary APCs such as B cells, dendritic cells, and plasma cells, given that plasma cells have been recognized as major peptide–MHC expressers in celiac disease lesions (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 1-3, høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 7-8).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease is known to be driven by an aberrant CD4+ T-cell response against deamidated gluten peptides bound to HLA-DQ2.5 molecules. The deamidation process—catalyzed by transglutaminase 2—enhances peptide binding affinity to HLA-DQ molecules, and the subsequent peptide–MHC complex is required for the activation of gluten-specific T cells (christophersen2019therapeuticanddiagnostic pages 3-3). Clinically, the presence of these complexes correlates closely with disease activity; patients consuming gluten exhibit robust presentation of deamidated gliadin–HLA-DQ complexes on intestinal APCs, while those on a gluten-free diet show reduced complex formation (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 3-5). Such data reinforce that blockade of peptide loading is directly relevant to the immunopathogenesis and therefore represents a compelling target for therapeutic intervention. The assay, by specifically assessing the formation and inhibition of these complexes, directly measures a critical mechanistic step in the disease cascade that leads to T-cell activation and intestinal inflammation (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 12-15).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nPeptide–MHC presentation blockade assays have been employed in both mechanistic studies and early therapeutic screening efforts. For instance, affinity-engineered human TCR-like antibodies, such as the 3.C11 antibody, have been used to not only detect but also functionally block the formation of deamidated gliadin–HLA-DQ2 complexes. These antibodies have demonstrated the ability to inhibit T-cell activation in vitro and even block proliferation and cytokine secretion, providing proof-of-concept that interfering with peptide–MHC formation can abrogate the pathogenic T-cell response (frick2019affinityengineeredhumanantibodies pages 1-4, frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 15-18). Furthermore, studies using flow cytometry to quantify pMHC complexes on APCs have clarified that plasma cells and B cells are predominant in presenting these complexes within the inflamed intestinal mucosa of celiac patients (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 7-8). Such discoveries have advanced our understanding of the cellular targets within the intestine and validated the use of this assay platform for drug discovery in celiac disease.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths:  \n• The assay directly interrogates a well-defined, disease-specific molecular interaction by quantifying the formation of deamidated gliadin–HLA-DQ2 complexes, which is central to celiac pathogenesis (christophersen2019therapeuticanddiagnostic pages 11-12).  \n• Its use of flow cytometry allows high sensitivity and single-cell resolution in detection, enabling detailed kinetic and quantitative assessments of peptide–MHC presentation and blockade efficacy (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 8-12).  \n• The platform has proven translational relevance, having been applied to both cell lines and primary patient-derived tissues, providing a robust model for early-stage therapeutic screening (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 15-20).  \n\nWeaknesses:  \n• In vitro systems may not fully capture the complex microenvironment and immune cell interactions in the intestinal mucosa, which could influence drug responses in vivo.  \n• The assay relies on highly specific reagents (fluorescent tetramers or conformation-specific antibodies) whose production and standardization could be resource-intensive, potentially affecting reproducibility across labs (frick2019engineeringtcrlikeantibodies pages 28-33).  \n• Given that regulatory mechanisms in peptide processing and antigen presentation might differ between experimental systems and human disease, complementary assays may be required to confirm biological activity seen in vitro.\n\nOverall, this peptide–MHC presentation blockade assay is a robust, mechanistically informed platform for testing therapeutic candidates aimed at interrupting the antigen presentation cascade in celiac disease (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 15-18, høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 3-5).

It directly recapitulates an early pathogenic event in celiac disease and has been used to characterize barrier-protective compounds such as larazotide. However, its reliance on cancer-derived cell lines omits the immune compartment, 3D architecture, and cellular heterogeneity of the human gut, limiting translational fidelity. Candidate 2 uses a co-culture of HLA-DQ2–expressing APCs loaded with deamidated gliadin peptides and gluten-specific CD4+ T-cell hybridomas, with IL-2 secretion as a quantitative readout of T-cell activation. This assay directly models the antigen presentation and adaptive immune activation central to celiac pathogenesis.

Gliadin is known to initiate zonulin release, which in turn disrupts tight junction proteins (e.g., claudins, occludins, ZO proteins) leading to increased paracellular permeability—a central event in celiac disease pathogenesis. The assay technique is label‐free and offers a real‐time quantitative readout of tight junction integrity by measuring TEER before and after gliadin exposure, thereby simulating the zonulin-mediated barrier dysfunction observed in patients (binienda2020dietarycarbohydratesand pages 1-3, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 12-13).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease is characterized by an abnormal immune response following gliadin ingestion, which induces zonulin release and subsequent disassembly of tight junctions. This chain of events increases intestinal permeability and permits gliadin peptides to translocate the epithelium, triggering inflammation and immune activation. Both biomedical and clinical literature underscore the importance of this barrier dysfunction in disease pathogenesis. Specifically, tight junction disruption is pivotal in initiating and sustaining the inflammatory cascade in celiac disease, and TEER decline is a reliable proxy for assessing this disruption in vitro. The underlying mechanisms—primarily zonulin-mediated modulation of tight junctions—are well-documented, lending strong support to the use of this assay to model critical steps of celiac disease pathology (binienda2020dietarycarbohydratesand pages 11-13, aleman2023leakygutand pages 8-9, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 13-14).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nTEER assays with gliadin-challenged Caco-2 or T84 monolayers have been extensively exploited in early-stage drug screening. They have been used to evaluate the efficacy of compounds such as larazotide acetate, which directly target zonulin-induced tight junction disassembly. Key studies have demonstrated that candidate therapeutics capable of mitigating gliadin-induced TEER decline successfully restore barrier integrity and might translate into beneficial clinical outcomes. This assay has thus played a significant role in de-risking drug candidates in pre-clinical pipelines by providing mechanistic insights into barrier protection strategies (binienda2020dietarycarbohydratesand pages 1-3, aleman2023leakygutand pages 1-3, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 12-13).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nA major strength of the TEER assay is its ability to deliver real-time, quantitative, and reproducible data on barrier integrity in a controlled in vitro environment. It effectively mimics the zonulin-mediated permeability changes triggered by gliadin, which are central to celiac disease pathogenesis. The label-free nature of the assay minimizes interference and allows for direct measurement of tight junction function. This makes it a valuable tool for screening potential therapeutics and understanding the underlying biological mechanisms of gut barrier dysfunction (lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 13-14, aleman2023leakygutand pages 8-9).\n\nNonetheless, there are inherent weaknesses. The use of cancer-derived cell lines such as Caco-2 and T84, while convenient and widely established, cannot fully capture the complexity of human intestinal tissue—lacking aspects such as cell-type diversity, immune interactions, and the three-dimensional architecture of the gut. These limitations may affect the assay’s translational predictability. Recent literature advocates for complementary use of advanced models such as intestinal organoids, which better recapitulate the native tissue microenvironment, despite their increased complexity and cost (lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 3-5, lechuga2023understandingdisruptionof pages 6-7).\n\nOverall, TEER-based assays following a gliadin challenge offer a robust, mechanistic platform for evaluating barrier-protective therapeutics in celiac disease.

The design specifically models the antigen presentation step that drives the aberrant T-cell activation seen in celiac disease (CeD). In this setup, the APCs, which may be professional cells (e.g., B cells) or engineered cell lines expressing HLA-DQ2 molecules, are pulsed with deamidated gliadin peptides—key immunogenic moieties generated by tissue transglutaminase (TG2)-mediated deamidation. Gluten-specific CD4+ T cells, derived from patient samples or as hybridomas, are then introduced. The primary measurement is the quantification of interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion using an ELISA, which functions as a proxy for T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement and activation (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 49-52, petersen2020tcellreceptor pages 17-20).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease pathogenesis is driven by an abnormal immune response initiated by deamidated gliadin peptides that are selectively presented by HLA-DQ2 (and HLA-DQ8) molecules, thus activating gluten-specific CD4+ T cells. This activation leads to intestinal mucosal inflammation and villous atrophy (buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12). The assay directly recapitulates this critical interaction by mimicking deamidated gliadin presentation and subsequent T-cell activation. Clinically, increased IL-2 levels have been observed post-gluten challenge in CeD patients, correlating with disease activity. This underlines the importance of IL-2 as a readout in the assay, making it an accurate marker for the immune events that occur in CeD (NCT03409796, NCT03738475).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nAssays employing co-culture systems with HLA-DQ2-positive APCs and gluten-specific T cells have a robust history in drug discovery for CeD. They have been instrumental in defining the sensitivity of T cells to specific deamidated gliadin epitopes and in evaluating the efficacy of immunotherapeutic candidates. For instance, research using similar setups measured T-cell activation via IL-2 secretion to assess the potency of novel interventions such as high-affinity TCR-like antibodies and peptide-based immunomodulatory agents (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 12-15, frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 15-18). Additionally, studies with Nexvax2 and other candidate compounds have harnessed antigen-specific T-cell assays detailing reduction in T-cell responses as a biomarker of potential therapeutic effectiveness (petersen2020tcellreceptor pages 17-20). Thus, the literature supports the utility of this approach in identifying drugs that can block or modulate the driving immunopathogenic interactions of CeD (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 252-255).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct relevance to the central events of CeD pathogenesis—antigen presentation and T-cell activation—providing a clear, quantifiable endpoint via IL-2 secretion. The use of a defined antigen (deamidated gliadin) and the inclusion of HLA-DQ2-positive APCs ensure disease specificity and high physiological relevance. Furthermore, the assay’s quantitative nature facilitates robust comparisons of drug efficacy and supports reproducibility across studies (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 49-52).\n\nHowever, there are also weaknesses and limitations. The in vitro model may not fully capture the complexity of the in vivo intestinal environment, including contributions from other immune cell types (e.g., B cells, dendritic cells) and the influence of gut microbiota. Moreover, reliance solely on IL-2 as an activation readout might overlook other relevant cytokine and chemokine cascades that contribute to CeD pathology. Integrating additional readouts, such as IFN-γ and T-cell proliferation markers, could provide a more comprehensive assessment of drug effects. Despite these limitations, the assay is scientifically sound, cost‐effective, and aligns well with current drug discovery strategies targeting T-cell mediated inflammation in celiac disease (rahmani2024anewmodel pages 265-266, buiten2021gliadinsequestrationas pages 10-12).\n\nIn summary, the co-culture T-cell activation suppression assay represents a robust platform for early-stage therapeutic screening in celiac disease, directly addressing a central mechanism of disease pathogenesis and offering a quantitative readout to evaluate potential interventions.', 'index': '7'}"

In this assay, differentiated enterocyte monolayers are treated with gliadin peptides to mimic the condition observed in celiac disease patients. FITC-dextran, a fluorescent tracer of a defined molecular weight (typically 4\u202fkDa), is then added to the apical side of the monolayer.

In celiac disease, gliadin peptides compromise tight junction function, thereby increasing intestinal barrier permeability and facilitating immune activation (khaleghi2016thepotentialutility pages 1-2). Clinically, increased intestinal permeability correlates with disease activity and severity, as impaired tight junctions allow the passage of immunogenic gliadin peptides into the lamina propria, triggering inflammation and tissue damage (schumann2017celiacdiseaserole pages 10-13).

Key discoveries using these models include the demonstration of size-selective permeability alterations, correlations with transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements, and identification of molecular changes in tight junction-associated proteins, establishing an experimental basis for drug screening (thompson2019modellingbarrierfunction pages 109-115).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct measurement of paracellular permeability changes, adding quantitative size-selective data that complements TEER measurements.

These stimuli simulate the inflammatory milieu and gliadin-induced cellular stress observed in the small intestinal mucosa of untreated celiac disease patients. Fluorogenic substrates that become cleaved by active caspase-3/7 produce a measurable fluorescence signal, which serves as a rapid and quantitative readout of apoptosis. This readout directly reflects the degree of enterocyte death and, subsequently, the protective effect of drugs targeting these pathways (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 4-5).  \n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nEpithelial apoptosis is a central pathological event in celiac disease, contributing significantly to villous atrophy and compromised barrier function. The inflammatory cytokines and gliadin peptides are shown to induce both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in enterocytes, leading to caspase-3 activation, a pivotal step in programmed cell death (perez2021programmedcelldeath pages 5-7). Moreover, additional studies have demonstrated that increased expression of apoptotic markers in intestinal biopsies of untreated celiac patients is closely associated with mucosal injury (ruera2023coexistenceofapoptosis pages 1-2).

There is also the concern that in some patient-derived organoid models, baseline apoptosis is not markedly elevated, suggesting that additional readouts such as barrier integrity or inflammatory cytokine profiles may need to be incorporated to provide a more comprehensive evaluation (freire2019humangutderivedorganoids pages 8-9).

Important scientific findings include the validation of first-in-class TG2 inhibitors, which showed significant reduction in probe incorporation, thereby confirming their inhibitory potential. These assays have also aided in elucidating the calcium dependency and substrate specificity of TG2, supporting their utility in screening and optimizing candidate therapeutics (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 35-39, isola2023theoraltransglutaminase pages 5-7).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its high-throughput capability, the use of a physiologically meaningful cell model (Caco-2), and a direct fluorescent readout that reflects both transamidation and deamidation activities of TG2. This setup mirrors the biological conditions encountered in the intestinal lumen of celiac patients, providing translational insight into how a compound might perform in vivo. Additionally, this assay format has a track record of being useful in early-stage drug discovery, offering rapid screening and quantitative measure of compound efficacy against TG2 activity (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 32-35, kim2019tissuestressand pages 24-28).  \n\nHowever, there are potential limitations. Variability in TG2 expression or activation state in Caco-2 cells may not fully recapitulate the complex in vivo intestinal microenvironment, where additional factors (e.g., immune cell interactions, extracellular matrix components) modulate disease progression. Moreover, the assay’s reliance on a single enzyme activity measure might overlook other downstream immunological events essential to celiac disease pathology. Further validation with complementary immunological and in vivo models would be necessary to fully establish therapeutic potential (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 127-133, isola2023theoraltransglutaminase pages 5-7).  \n\nIn conclusion, the proposed cell-based fluorescent TG2 inhibition assay is a robust and scientifically sound platform for early-stage screening of potential celiac disease therapeutics, with clear biomedical and translational relevance despite some inherent limitations that warrant supplementary studies.', 'index': '0'}","{'hypothesis': 'Epithelial Apoptosis Prevention', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay is designed to evaluate the efficacy of candidate drugs in preventing epithelial apoptosis in celiac disease by measuring caspase-3/7 activity.

The assay uses fluorescent tetramers or conformation‐specific antibodies to detect complexes formed between deamidated gliadin peptides and HLA-DQ2; these complexes are quantified by flow cytometry. The readout is the surface density and frequency of peptide–MHC complexes on APCs, providing a direct measurement of peptide loading efficiency and inhibition in the presence of candidate compounds. The assay might be performed on cell lines or primary APCs such as B cells, dendritic cells, and plasma cells, given that plasma cells have been recognized as major peptide–MHC expressers in celiac disease lesions (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 1-3, høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 7-8).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease is known to be driven by an aberrant CD4+ T-cell response against deamidated gluten peptides bound to HLA-DQ2.5 molecules. The deamidation process—catalyzed by transglutaminase 2—enhances peptide binding affinity to HLA-DQ molecules, and the subsequent peptide–MHC complex is required for the activation of gluten-specific T cells (christophersen2019therapeuticanddiagnostic pages 3-3). Clinically, the presence of these complexes correlates closely with disease activity; patients consuming gluten exhibit robust presentation of deamidated gliadin–HLA-DQ complexes on intestinal APCs, while those on a gluten-free diet show reduced complex formation (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 3-5). Such data reinforce that blockade of peptide loading is directly relevant to the immunopathogenesis and therefore represents a compelling target for therapeutic intervention. The assay, by specifically assessing the formation and inhibition of these complexes, directly measures a critical mechanistic step in the disease cascade that leads to T-cell activation and intestinal inflammation (frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 12-15).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nPeptide–MHC presentation blockade assays have been employed in both mechanistic studies and early therapeutic screening efforts. For instance, affinity-engineered human TCR-like antibodies, such as the 3.C11 antibody, have been used to not only detect but also functionally block the formation of deamidated gliadin–HLA-DQ2 complexes. These antibodies have demonstrated the ability to inhibit T-cell activation in vitro and even block proliferation and cytokine secretion, providing proof-of-concept that interfering with peptide–MHC formation can abrogate the pathogenic T-cell response (frick2019affinityengineeredhumanantibodies pages 1-4, frick2021ahighaffinityhuman pages 15-18). Furthermore, studies using flow cytometry to quantify pMHC complexes on APCs have clarified that plasma cells and B cells are predominant in presenting these complexes within the inflamed intestinal mucosa of celiac patients (høydahl2019plasmacellsare pages 7-8).

First, Caco‑2 and HT‑29 cells, although useful, are limited in their capacity to fully recapitulate the complex in vivo environment of the intestinal mucosa, which involves multiple cell types, immune interactions, and three‑dimensional architecture that are better modeled in organoids (NCT05294107). Second, while NF‑κB signaling is an important mediator of inflammation, celiac disease pathogenesis is multifactorial and involves adaptive immune responses and additional pathways such as those involving FLT3 and ATG16L1, which may be underrepresented in a single‑readout assay (OpenTargets Search: celiac disease-NFKB1,NFKB2,RELA,RELB,RELC). Finally, the assay’s dependence on over‑expressed luciferase reporters might sometimes mask subtle modulatory effects or compensatory pathways that occur in a more physiologically representative system.\n\nIn conclusion, while the NF‑κB luciferase reporter assay in Caco‑2 or HT‑29 cells provides a robust, sensitive, and high‑throughput platform for initial screening of anti‑inflammatory compounds relevant to celiac disease, complementary models—including organoid systems and broader pathway analyses—are advisable to fully capture the complexity of the disease's pathogenesis (yu2022thenutritionalintervention pages 9-10, olazagoitiagarmendia2022gluteninducedrnamethylation pages 9-9)."", 'index': '4'}"

This assay models a critical step in celiac disease (CD) pathogenesis, where TG2-mediated modifications enhance gliadin peptide immunogenicity, leading to T cell activation via binding to HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules. The approach relies on using biologically relevant substrates (gliadin peptides) and, optimally, gut epithelial cell cultures or cell lysates that more accurately recapitulate the enzyme’s behavior in the small intestine (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 10-11, alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCeliac disease is primarily driven by the enzymatic activity of TG2, which converts gliadin peptides into more immunogenic forms through deamidation and cross-linking. The generation of these modified gliadin epitopes is fundamental to the pathogenesis of CD because they bind with increased affinity to HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 molecules, thereby activating pathogenic CD4+ T cells and precipitating the inflammatory cascade associated with intestinal damage (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183, buchold2022featuresofzed1227 pages 2-3). Clinical observations further support this model, given that alterations in TG2 expression and activity correlate with disease activity, and serological markers such as anti-TG2 antibodies serve as reliable diagnostic indicators (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 4-5). Moreover, the translational success of TG2 inhibitors in preclinical models underlines the clinical importance of directly targeting this biochemical pathway (wichka2024rapiddiscoveryof pages 1-2).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nAssays designed to quantify TG2-mediated deamidation are not entirely new. Initial studies have applied fluorescence-based assays, for example, monitoring ammonia release as a surrogate marker for deamidation activity on gliadin and other substrates (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 173-177, pages 180-183). More recently, LC-MS/MS platforms have been integrated into these studies to provide direct chemical characterization of gliadin modifications, overcoming the limitations of antibody-based detection methods and offering high sensitivity and specificity in profiling pathogenic epitopes (alves2017determinationofgluten pages 6-8, palanski2022anefficienturine pages 1-4). This evolution in assay design has led to improved evaluation of inhibitor potency, target engagement, and a more nuanced understanding of the molecular events that drive CD pathogenesis (buchold2022featuresofzed1227 pages 11-13).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its molecular specificity and the capacity to dissect enzymatic modifications with high resolution. LC-MS/MS-based profiling provides direct quantification of deamidated and cross-linked products, offering precise measurements of target engagement by inhibitors. This level of detail is critical for early-stage drug discovery, as it links biochemical modifications directly with pathogenic epitope formation. Additionally, by employing biologically relevant substrates and cell culture models that mirror gut epithelial cell behavior, the assay offers an in vitro platform that is pathophysiologically relevant (amundsen2023expressionoftransglutaminase pages 10-11, alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183).\n\nHowever, there are potential weaknesses. The complexity of LC-MS/MS may introduce challenges in assay standardization and reproducibility, particularly regarding sample preparation from cell culture supernatants. Variability in enzyme activity in cell systems compared to purified systems may also complicate the interpretation of inhibitor efficacy. Furthermore, while the assay exerts excellent analytical precision, additional in vivo or ex vivo validation might be necessary to confirm that changes observed in peptide modifications translate into meaningful clinical outcomes (alshintari2019themodulatoryeffects pages 180-183, buchold2022featuresofzed1227 pages 11-13).\n\nIn summary, the LC-MS/MS-based gliadin modification profiling assay is a scientifically sound and highly specific approach. It effectively models a central biochemical event in CD and is well-suited for early-stage drug discovery—even though attention to assay optimization and biological variability will be vital to its successful application.', 'index': '9'}"
