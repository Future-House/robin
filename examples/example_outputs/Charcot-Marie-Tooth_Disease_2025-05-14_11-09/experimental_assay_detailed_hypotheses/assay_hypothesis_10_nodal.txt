Assay Overview:
The proposed assay is a nodal domain formation assay designed to quantify the re‐assembly of nodes of Ranvier in vitro. It models a key aspect of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease pathogenesis by evaluating the restoration of compact myelin and the associated re‐establishment of functional nodal architecture. The assay utilizes immunostaining techniques targeting pan–voltage‐gated sodium channels (pan–Nav) to mark nodes and Caspr to delineate paranodal regions, with subsequent automated image analysis for unbiased node counting. Typically, co‐cultures of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–derived sensory neurons paired with Schwann cells (often from rodent sources) are used to recapitulate human axoglial interactions and myelination processes (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2).

Biomedical Evidence:
In CMT disease, peripheral neuropathies manifest due to both demyelination and axonal degeneration, where nodal and paranodal structures play a crucial role in sustaining saltatory conduction. Disruption of nodal integrity leads to conduction slowing and clinical deficits; therefore, assessing the restoration of node organization provides a critical functional readout. This significance is underscored by clinical research which has linked nodal pathology directly to disease severity in peripheral neuropathies (fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7). Moreover, clinical trial registries such as Clinical Trials Search: (Charcot-Marie-Tooth OR CMT) AND myelin restoration OR node of Ranvier further emphasize ongoing efforts to target these structural domains therapeutically. Given that nodal architecture is not only essential for proper nerve conduction but also serves as an indicator of underlying myelin repair and axonal stability, an assay that directly interrogates these domains is highly pertinent for preclinical drug screening.

Previous Use:
The nodal domain formation assay has been implemented in several key studies for drug discovery and mechanistic characterization in neuropathies. For example, co-culture systems described by Clark et al. have successfully employed immunostaining for pan–Nav and Caspr in long-term cultures to reliably quantify nodal assembly as a surrogate marker for myelination integrity (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 10-13). Another study investigating anti-pan-neurofascin antibodies demonstrated that antibody-mediated disruption of nodal components could be quantitatively assessed through similar imaging techniques, providing insights on pathological progress versus therapeutic response (appeltshauser2023antipanneurofascinantibodiesinduce pages 13-13). Furthermore, the use of automated node counting has been validated as a sensitive method to detect subtle changes in nodal organization, reinforcing its application in screening candidate compounds aimed at restoring node integrity (ronchi2023morphologicalmethodsto pages 4-7).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of this assay include its high biological relevance since it directly measures a key functional endpoint—node formation—which correlates with restored nerve conduction, a critical requirement for effective therapies in CMT. The automated quantification minimizes observer bias, thereby allowing high-throughput screening potential and reproducibility across experiments (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, ronchi2023morphologicalmethodsto pages 4-7). Moreover, utilizing human iPSC-derived neurons ensures that the assay has translational relevance; it effectively bridges in vitro findings to clinical scenarios despite the use of rodent Schwann cells in some models.

However, weaknesses exist. The co-culture environment may not fully replicate the in vivo complexity of peripheral nerves. Species differences—such as those between human neuronal components and rodent glia—could add variability to the results (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 10-13). Additionally, while restoration of nodal architecture is indicative of improved myelination, it remains essential to correlate these structural improvements with functional electrophysiological recovery to ascertain true therapeutic benefit (fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7). The assay’s reliance on fixed immunostaining also limits real-time or dynamic assessment of node formation, and variability in culture conditions or antibody specificity might affect assay sensitivity.

In summary, the nodal domain formation assay represents a valuable and mechanistically relevant platform for early-stage drug discovery in CMT. Its ability to quantitatively assess nodal integrity offers a direct functional readout of myelin repair, although its findings must be integrated with complementary functional assays and in vivo validations to fully capture therapeutic efficacy (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7).
