Assay Overview:
This assay is designed to quantify mitochondrial morphology changes—specifically measuring the balance between mitochondrial fragmentation and fusion—in Schwann cells derived from models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease carrying MFN2 mutations. Since MFN2 is essential for mitochondrial fusion, aberrations in its activity result in fragmented mitochondrial networks, a pathology observed in CMT patients. The assay utilizes live‐cell imaging with Mitotracker dyes that selectively stain mitochondria. Automated network‐morphology analysis software is then employed to quantify parameters such as mitochondrial aspect ratio, branch length, and total network connectivity. The measurements derive from high-resolution confocal microscopy images where mitochondrial fusion restoration upon treatment with candidate drugs (e.g., mitofusin activators) would be detected as increased connectivity and elongated mitochondrial morphology (franco2020burstmitofusinactivation pages 2-4, franco2022mitochondrialdysfunctionand pages 1-2). Although many studies have used neurons or fibroblasts, the focus here on Schwann cells is particularly relevant given their key role in peripheral nerve myelination, which is compromised in CMT (almutawaa2020insightsintothe pages 133-136).

Biomedical Evidence:
Mitochondrial dysfunction, and particularly the loss of mitochondrial fusion, is central to the pathogenesis of CMT2A, the form most frequently associated with MFN2 mutations. Mutated MFN2 impairs the fusion process, leading to fragmented mitochondria, which in turn affect energy metabolism, axonal transport, and cell survival. Clinical correlations have been made between the severity of mitochondrial fragmentation and the progression of neuropathy in CMT patients, emphasizing the importance of mitochondrial network integrity in disease pathogenesis (OpenTargets Search: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-MFN2). Moreover, literature indicates that Schwann cells with MFN2 mutations can exhibit compromised mitochondrial dynamics, which is hypothesized to disrupt peripheral nerve myelination and axonal support (almutawaa2020insightsintothe pages 114-119, schiavon2021impairedmitochondrialmobility pages 1-2). Thus, by directly evaluating mitochondrial morphology, the assay targets a key molecular mechanism of CMT, making it a biologically and clinically relevant tool for therapeutic evaluation.

Previous Use:
Mitochondrial morphology assays using live-cell Mitotracker imaging have been extensively validated in preclinical studies investigating MFN2-related neurological disorders. For instance, prior studies have employed such assays in motor neurons and fibroblasts to demonstrate that pharmacological activation of mitofusins can restore normal mitochondrial structure and function (franco2020burstmitofusinactivation pages 6-9, rocha2018mfn2agonistsreverse pages 4-4). These studies have not only proven the feasibility of quantifying mitochondrial dynamics in vitro but have also directly linked improvements in mitochondrial morphology with functional recovery in disease models. Although the majority of these reports have focused on neuronal cells, the methodological framework is directly transferable to Schwann cells, a cell type highly relevant to CMT pathology (franco2020burstmitofusinactivation pages 24-25).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of this assay include its direct measurement of a critical disease mechanism—MFN2-mediated mitochondrial dynamics—which is central to CMT pathogenesis. The combination of live-cell imaging and automated quantitative analysis ensures high throughput, reproducibility, and objectivity, essential attributes for early-stage drug screening. Additionally, this assay provides a phenotypic readout that can be directly correlated with mitochondrial function and potentially with overall cell health, an attractive feature for preclinical studies (franco2020burstmitofusinactivation pages 12-13, franco2022mitochondrialdysfunctionand pages 2-2).

However, there are some weaknesses. The adaptation of this assay specifically to Schwann cells may require further optimization, given that many existing protocols are tailored for neurons or fibroblasts. Moreover, while mitochondrial morphology is a sensitive biomarker of MFN2 activity, it does not capture all aspects of mitochondrial function such as bioenergetics and intracellular signaling, which may also influence disease progression (almutawaa2020insightsintothe pages 133-136). The assay's predictive power for therapeutic efficacy in vivo remains to be fully validated, necessitating complementary functional studies and in vivo assessments in animal models (franco2020burstmitofusinactivation pages 2-4).

In summary, the mitochondrial morphology assay described is a promising and scientifically robust platform for evaluating drugs aimed at restoring MFN2 function in CMT. While certain technical challenges remain, particularly in optimizing the system for Schwann cells, the assay’s mechanistic and clinical relevance make it a valuable component of early-stage drug discovery pipelines for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
