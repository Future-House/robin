Assay Overview:
The proposed autophagic flux assay leverages the mCherry-GFP-LC3 tandem reporter to monitor the dynamics of autophagy in Schwann cells affected by Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. In this assay, the reporter is expressed in disease-relevant cell cultures (e.g., primary Schwann cells or hiPSC-derived Schwann cells) to model the impact of MPZ and PMP22 misfolding on proteostasis. The construct allows the visualization of LC3‐positive autophagosomes through the dual fluorescence signals: GFP signal is quenched upon lysosomal fusion due to the acidic environment while the mCherry signal persists, thereby enabling discrimination between autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Quantitative metrics such as puncta count and the ratio of mCherry to GFP fluorescence provide data on autophagosome formation and lysosomal fusion rates. This assay specifically models the degradation pathway implicated in the clearance of misfolded proteins in Schwann cells—a central pathogenic mechanism in CMT (chittoorvinod2015induciblehsp70is pages 1-2, kim2017molecularmechanismsof pages 14-19).

Biomedical Evidence:
A substantial body of literature supports that misfolding of myelin proteins, notably PMP22 and MPZ, triggers proteostatic stress, which in turn activates autophagy in Schwann cells. Disruption in protein quality control systems, including the autophagy pathway, is a hallmark of CMT pathology, as abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins contributes to demyelination and Schwann cell dysfunction. Autophagy not only serves as a degradation mechanism to clear misfolded proteins but also influences myelin maintenance and turnover. Elevated autophagic flux has been observed under conditions of proteotoxic stress induced by mutant forms of PMP22 and aberrant MPZ in various in vitro models, emphasizing the mechanistic link between autophagy impairment and CMT disease progression (kim2017molecularmechanismsof pages 28-33, kim2017molecularmechanismsof pages 38-43). Clinically, these molecular perturbations translate into the demyelination and axonal atrophy seen in CMT patients, confirming that targeting autophagy modulation is a therapeutically relevant strategy (miressi2020hereditaryperipheralneuropathies pages 262-265).

Previous Use:
The mCherry-GFP-LC3 tandem reporter assay is a well-established method employed in various neurodegenerative and neuropathic disease models. It has been used to monitor autophagic flux in patient-derived fibroblasts and hiPSC-derived neurons, notably in studies of Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) where autophagy regulation and mitophagy were carefully quantified (cavaliere2024usinghipscderivedneural pages 56-59, cavaliere2024usinghipscderivedneural pages 37-40). In the context of CMT, research using similar approaches has demonstrated that pharmacological activation of autophagy can ameliorate protein aggregation and improve Schwann cell function. Furthermore, disease modeling studies using hiPSC-derived Schwann cells from CMT patients have highlighted the value of dynamic autophagy readouts in identifying potential therapeutic modulators (mukherjeeclavin2017modelingcharcotmarie pages 45-53, juneja2019challengesinmodelling pages 6-7).

Overall Evaluation:
One of the major strengths of this assay lies in its ability to provide a dynamic, quantitative measure of autophagic flux, which is directly implicated in the cellular processing of misfolded myelin proteins in CMT. The use of a fluorescent reporter enables live-cell imaging and high-content screening, making it an attractive platform for early-stage drug discovery. Additionally, the assay’s translational relevance is underscored by its successful application in patient-derived cell models that recapitulate aspects of CMT pathogenesis (perrone2019theautophagysignaling pages 18-18).

However, there are several weaknesses to consider. The generation of fully mature and myelinating Schwann cells from hiPSCs remains challenging, which might affect the assay’s physiological relevance (juneja2019challengesinmodelling pages 6-7). Moreover, technical issues such as variability in transfection efficiency and reporter expression, as well as potential photobleaching during fluorescence microscopy, could impact data consistency and assay throughput. Thus, while the assay is robust in measuring autophagic flux, careful optimization and standardization across different cell models will be necessary for its successful application in drug discovery pipelines for CMT (kim2017molecularmechanismsof pages 145-150).
