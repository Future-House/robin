Assay Overview:
This assay employs a CHOP or BiP promoter‐driven luciferase reporter in Schwann cells to model the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress component of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) pathogenesis. In the assay, pathogenic stimuli—either via overexpression of wild type or mutant peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) or treatment with ER stress inducers like thapsigargin or tunicamycin—activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) and induce the expression of ER stress markers. The luciferase reporter under the control of either the CHOP or BiP promoter provides a rapid, quantitative readout of stress levels by measuring luminescence intensity. In practice, cultured Schwann cell lines or primary Schwann cells serve as the biologically relevant platform, providing a capable system to detect and quantify small-molecule rescue effects on ER stress levels (choi2015developmentofcell pages 3-4, choi2015developmentofcell pages 4-6).

Biomedical Evidence:
Biochemical and biomedical evidence supports that misfolded proteins resulting from PMP22 overexpression or mutation are retained in the ER, leading to significant stress and activation of the UPR in Schwann cells—a key pathogenic mechanism in certain CMT subtypes. Experimental studies demonstrate that mutant forms of PMP22 can induce a dose-dependent increase in ER stress markers (such as PERK, CHOP, and BiP), implicating ER stress as a driver of Schwann cell dysfunction and cell death (choi2015developmentofcell pages 3-4, gutmann2015updateoncharcot–marie–tooth pages 6-7). Moreover, while some evidence suggests that ER stress may not be a primary driver in every CMT context (as indicated in some CMT1A models where baseline ER stress is low; doris2021molecularroleof pages 57-62, doris2021molecularroleof pages 96-99), ER stress clearly plays a pivotal role in the molecular pathology of CMT forms associated with misfolded myelin proteins. Hence, targeting ER stress and the UPR in Schwann cells represents a valid therapeutic strategy, with CHOP and BiP serving as robust surrogate markers reflective of disease modulation (kleopa2023cmt1acurrentgene pages 1-2, scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 22-23).

Previous Use:
ER stress reporter assays have been utilized previously in both genetically induced and chemically induced models of ER stress. For example, studies using Schwann cell models have shown that overexpression of mutant PMP22 leads to ER stress induction that is detectable via luciferase reporter constructs under the control of ER stress-responsive promoters (choi2015developmentofcell pages 3-4, choi2015developmentofcell pages 6-6). Additionally, chemical inducers such as thapsigargin and tunicamycin have been employed to mimic the cellular stress seen with pathogenic protein accumulation, providing a stable and reproducible assay for small-molecule screening (chittoorvinod2015induciblehsp70is pages 1-2). These approaches have enabled the identification of compounds that can alleviate ER stress in vitro, with the resulting reduction in reporter activity correlating well with improved cell viability and function—findings that have also informed therapeutic strategies in preclinical models of CMT (scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 17-18).

Overall Evaluation:
The strengths of this assay lie in its simplicity, quantitative output, and high-throughput potential. The use of a luminescent reporter system enables rapid screening of compound libraries, making it particularly useful in early-stage drug discovery efforts targeting the ER stress pathway. The biological relevance of using Schwann cells, the primary cell type affected in CMT pathology, further enhances its translational potential (choi2015developmentofcell pages 3-4, volpi2019schwanncellserassociated pages 27-28). However, there are limitations. Given that ER stress may not be a uniform pathogenic mechanism in all CMT subtypes—especially in cases such as CMT1A where primary pathology may involve other cellular mechanisms—the assay may need to be complemented by additional functional assays to capture the full therapeutic profile of candidate drugs (doris2021molecularroleof pages 57-62, doris2021molecularroleof pages 96-99). Moreover, variability in reporter activity across different cell culture conditions could affect reproducibility and necessitate rigorous optimization. Overall, despite these challenges, the ER stress reporter assay constitutes a robust and mechanistically relevant tool for the preclinical evaluation of therapeutics aimed at reducing ER stress and mitigating Schwann cell dysfunction in CMT (gutmann2015updateoncharcot–marie–tooth pages 10-11, scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 22-23).
