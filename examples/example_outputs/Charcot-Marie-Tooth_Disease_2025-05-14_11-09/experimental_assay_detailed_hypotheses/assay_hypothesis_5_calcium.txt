Assay Overview:
The proposed calcium flux assay leverages fluorescent calcium indicators—such as Fluo-4—or genetically encoded Ca²⁺ sensors to monitor store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) kinetics in Schwann cells. This assay specifically targets the pathological disruption of ER–mitochondria Ca²⁺ exchange, a key aspect of Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease pathogenesis. It involves measuring cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium transients upon depletion of ER calcium stores (using agents like thapsigargin), followed by real-time detection of calcium influx. The assay is designed to use primary Schwann cell cultures or Schwann cell–derived lines, which are directly relevant to CMT pathology given their role in myelination in the peripheral nervous system (sanchez2017storeoperatedcalciumentry pages 20-22, vajente2019impactofer pages 27-30).

Biomedical Evidence:
There is compelling biomedical evidence that disrupted ER–mitochondria Ca²⁺ exchange plays a central role in CMT pathogenesis. Mutations in genes such as GDAP1 cause alterations in mitochondrial dynamics and impair Ca²⁺ signaling, leading to deficits in mitochondrial energy production and calcium homeostasis. For example, GDAP1 deficiency has been related to reduced physical contacts between the ER and mitochondria, impairing calcium transfer and SOCE dynamics (sanchez2017storeoperatedcalciumentry pages 20-22). Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that the impaired SOCE in neural and neuroblastoma cells directly correlates with mitochondrial dysfunction—an observation highly relevant to the pathology observed in Schwann cells of CMT patients (sanchez2017storeoperatedcalciumentry pages 60-64, terry2022missensemutationsin pages 15-18). Clinically, maintaining proper Ca²⁺ flux is essential to preserve Schwann cell function, and aberrant calcium signaling has been linked to disrupted myelination and axonal support, hallmarks of CMT (vanoye2019peripheralmyelinprotein pages 1-2).

Previous Use:
Calcium flux assays have been widely employed in the investigation of neural cell function and mitochondrial bioenergetics. In multiple studies, fluorescent indicators such as Fluo-4 and ratiometric FRET-based probes have been used to quantify SOCE activity and mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake in neuroblastoma cells and cortical neurons (sanchez2017storeoperatedcalciumentry pages 48-52, sanchez2017storeoperatedcalciumentry pages 42-45). Notably, the re-expression of GDAP1 in deficient cells was shown to restore normal SOCE dynamics, providing strong evidence of the assay's sensitivity in capturing disease-relevant calcium disturbances (sanchez2017storeoperatedcalciumentry pages 60-64). Similar approaches have been implemented in studies evaluating the effects of mutations in proteins such as PMP22 and IP3R3, further supporting the utility of this assay in drug discovery contexts for peripheral neuropathies (vanoye2019peripheralmyelinprotein pages 1-2, terry2022missensemutationsin pages 15-18, vajente2019impactofer pages 27-30).

Overall Evaluation:
The major strength of this assay lies in its capacity for real-time, quantitative analysis of Ca²⁺ dynamics, directly linking disrupted ER–mitochondria Ca²⁺ exchange to the bioenergetic deficits observed in CMT. Its application in Schwann cell cultures ensures that the assay is highly relevant to the disease context, providing a functional platform for high-throughput drug screening. Genetically encoded sensors offer the advantage of organelle-specific measurements, allowing researchers to discern between cytosolic, ER, and mitochondrial calcium responses, which is crucial for understanding the multifaceted nature of calcium deregulation in CMT (heredia2020calciumsignalingin pages 2-4, liiv2024ercalciumdepletion pages 13-14).

However, potential weaknesses include the variability associated with primary Schwann cell cultures and the technical challenges of accurately measuring rapid calcium flux events in complex cellular environments. Fluorescent assays can be sensitive to artifacts such as dye loading variations and photobleaching, necessitating rigorous controls. Additionally, while calcium flux measurements offer valuable insights into one aspect of CMT pathology, they must be complemented with assays assessing myelin integrity and mitochondrial bioenergetics to provide a comprehensive evaluation of therapeutic candidates (sanchez2017storeoperatedcalciumentry pages 86-89, vajente2019impactofer pages 27-30).

In summary, given the central role of disrupted calcium homeostasis in CMT, this calcium flux assay constitutes a robust and relevant platform for early-stage drug discovery, enabling the identification of compounds that can restore proper ER–mitochondria Ca²⁺ exchange and ameliorate associated bioenergetic dysfunction.
