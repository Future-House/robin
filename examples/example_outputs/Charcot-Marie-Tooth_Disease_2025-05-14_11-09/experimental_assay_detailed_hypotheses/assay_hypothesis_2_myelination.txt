Assay Overview:
This assay utilizes immunofluorescent quantification of myelin basic protein (MBP) relative to neurofilament 200 (NF200) in Schwann cell–neuron co‐cultures. It is designed to model the axoglial interaction critical for peripheral myelination—the process by which Schwann cells ensheathe axons to form a compact myelin layer. In practice, the assay involves culturing Schwann cells together with neurons—these may be derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) or primary sources—and staining them with antibodies against MBP to mark myelin sheaths and against NF200 to label axons. Automated imaging pipelines then quantify fluorescence, providing a myelination index that reflects both the extent and quality of myelin formation (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7).

Biomedical Evidence:
Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is characterized predominantly by demyelination or dysmyelination defects in the peripheral nervous system. Aberrations in myelin integrity and Schwann cell function lie at the core of CMT pathogenesis. The assay’s focus on quantifying MBP relative to NF200 directly models these processes because an effective myelin sheath is a hallmark of healthy peripheral nerve function. Critical research has shown that disruptions in myelin formation, as seen in genetically modified models of CMT (for instance, in CMT4B2), manifest in altered MBP distribution and myelin outfoldings, which this assay can capture (robinson2018aninvitro pages 1-2, scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 2-3). On the clinical side, the standard use of imaging biomarkers to quantify myelin content in patients (e.g., magnetization transfer ratio in MRI studies) underscores the centrality of myelin in both disease progression and therapeutic response (dortch2014proximalnervemagnetization pages 1-2).

Previous Use:
The myelination index assay has been effectively applied in multiple in vitro systems as a screening tool for pharmacological interventions targeting myelination. Notably, Clark and colleagues developed long-term, stable myelinating co-cultures using human iPSC-derived sensory neurons and rat Schwann cells, showing that immunofluorescence-based measurements of MBP and NF200 yield a reliable readout of myelin sheath formation (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, pages 10-13). In a similar vein, Hyung et al. employed primary motor neuron–Schwann cell co-cultures to demonstrate that MBP immunostaining effectively tracks Schwann cell differentiation and myelin formation, with the assay being sensitive to the effects of neuroactive compounds (hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7, pages 7-9, pages 9-10). Furthermore, in studies focused on CMT models, Robinson and colleagues have used related immunofluorescence quantification methods to evaluate phenotypic myelin abnormalities in Schwann cell-neuron co‐cultures (robinson2018aninvitro pages 6-8).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of the myelination index assay include its direct measurement of biologically relevant endpoints. It provides a quantitative, reproducible, and scalable readout of myelin sheath formation that is amenable to high-throughput screening—an advantage for early-stage drug discovery. The system is also flexible, allowing for the use of various cell sources (human, rodent, or iPSC-derived), which can help model both species-specific aspects of myelination and disease-specific phenotypes in CMT (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7).
However, several limitations must be considered. Variability in the inherent myelination capability of different Schwann cell populations (e.g., human versus rat) can complicate data interpretation and translational relevance (chesnut2021humanipscderivedmodel pages 10-11, chesnut2021humanipscderivedmodel pages 2-4). Additionally, while the assay focuses on mature myelin formation, early-stage changes in oligodendrocyte or Schwann cell differentiation might not be well resolved. Correlation with in vivo endpoints—such as those provided by MRI-based biomarkers—is necessary to fully validate the assay’s predictive power for therapeutic efficacy (dortch2014proximalnervemagnetization pages 1-2). Despite these challenges, the assay remains a promising and credible platform for evaluating drug candidates aimed at restoring or enhancing myelin integrity in CMT (scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 2-3).

Overall, the immunofluorescent MBP/NF200 myelination index assay is scientifically robust and well-grounded in both biomedical and clinical evidence for peripheral demyelinating conditions like Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. Its established use in co-culture systems and compatibility with automated imaging render it a valuable tool in early-stage therapeutic evaluation, provided that supplementary endpoints and rigorous validation strategies are incorporated to address its inherent limitations.
