Hypothesis: Axonal transport assay

Query: You are a professional biomedical researcher, having experience in early-stage drug discovery and validation in vitro. Your task is to evaluate cell culture assays that would be used to evaluate drugs to treat Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease.
        Given the following assay, do a comprehensive literature review to evaluate if this assay would be useful for testing therapeutics for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. Search relevant literature across
        biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature about the disease or therapeutic landscape. Don't look up specific drugs, but any relevant scientific information that may inform assay development.Strategy: Axonal transport assay

Assay Overview:
This approach employs an axonal transport assay using microfluidic co‐culture systems that compartmentalize neurons and Schwann cells to mimic the peripheral nerve environment. In this assay, neurons (often derived from primary cultures or induced pluripotent stem cells) extend axons into microfluidic channels where they are co-cultured with Schwann cells to support myelination. The assay models disease-relevant demyelination and its impact on mitochondrial motility along axons. Live cell imaging is employed to capture dynamic mitochondrial transport, with quantification performed via kymograph-based analysis. Key measurements include mitochondrial transport velocity, frequency, directionality (anterograde vs retrograde), pause frequencies, and distribution along the axon. This setup directly assesses the transport function of mitochondria and provides a functional endpoint to gauge the efficacy of candidate therapeutics targeting axonal transport and mitochondrial dynamics (sarajarvi2020investigatingcellularpathomechanisms pages 172-178, beijer2019defectsinaxonal pages 12-14).

Biomedical Evidence:
The central pathology in many Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease subtypes involves mutations in genes such as MFN2, GDAP1, NEFL, and others that are critical for mitochondrial function and axonal transport. Defects in mitochondrial mobility lead to energy deficits in distal axons, contributing directly to axonopathy and clinical manifestations of CMT. Demyelination exacerbates these transport deficits by compromising the supportive interactions between Schwann cells and axons, which are essential for maintaining metabolic and trophic functions. Therefore, an assay that quantitatively evaluates mitochondrial transport in a neuron-Schwann cell co-culture is highly relevant, as it directly probes the mechanistic basis of CMT pathogenesis. The biomedical literature underscores that impaired mitochondrial dynamics not only reflect disease severity but also represent a druggable pathway to potentially restore neuronal health, providing a compelling rationale for the use of this assay in early-stage therapeutic screening (schiavon2021impairedmitochondrialmobility pages 1-2, sarajarvi2020investigatingcellularpathomechanisms pages 172-178).

Previous Use:
Microfluidic axonal transport assays have previously been applied to models of inherited axonopathies, including various forms of CMT. Key scientific advances have been achieved by using these platforms to measure axonal mitochondrial dynamics. For example, studies employing these assays have demonstrated that HDAC6 inhibitors can increase tubulin acetylation, thereby stabilizing microtubules and enhancing mitochondrial transport, which resulted in functional rescue in models of CMT2F (adalbert2019novelhdac6inhibitors pages 1-3). Similar platforms have been successfully used to test candidate drugs by quantifying changes in mitochondrial velocity and distribution, offering mechanistic insights that correlate with improvements in neuronal function. These results support the assay’s applicability to early drug screening efforts in the CMT landscape (beijer2019defectsinaxonal pages 12-14, saporta2015axonalcharcot–marie–toothdisease pages 9-11).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of the assay include its physiological relevance by recapitulating the neuron-Schwann cell interactions in a compartmentalized system that mimics the peripheral nerve environment. The live imaging coupled with quantitative kymograph analysis allows for high-resolution measurement of mitochondrial transport parameters, which are directly linked to disease pathology in CMT. Moreover, because the assay focuses on a central aspect of CMT pathogenesis—mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired axonal transport—it provides a direct readout for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions aimed at alleviating these deficits.

Weaknesses include the inherent variability in cell culture models—differences among primary, patient-derived, and iPSC-derived cells can influence transport dynamics. The technical complexity and requirement for advanced imaging and analysis tools may limit throughput, posing challenges for large-scale screening. Furthermore, while the assay is robust in modeling cellular pathology, its in vitro nature means that additional in vivo studies will be necessary to confirm translation to clinical outcomes. Overall, however, the assay is a promising platform for early-stage drug discovery in CMT, aligning well with both biomedical and clinical evidence linking mitochondrial transport deficits to disease progression (sleigh2023boostingperipheralbdnf pages 17-18, chamberlain2019mechanismsforthe pages 7-9).
