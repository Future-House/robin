"(Gap junction coupling assay, 2)","(Proteasome activity assay, 6)","Both assays address key pathological mechanisms in different subtypes of Charcot-Marie‐Tooth disease (CMT). Candidate 1 (Gap junction coupling assay) directly measures connexin32‐mediated intercellular communication in Schwann cells—a core functional deficit in X‐linked CMT (CMTX1). Its readout (dye spread) is a direct functional endpoint, biologically specific, and has a clear link to GJB1 mutations. The assay uses established scrape‐loading protocols and fluorescent microscopy, offering quantitative, cell‐based measurements but with moderate variability and limited throughput unless automated. Candidate 2 (Proteasome activity assay) quantifies the chymotrypsin‐like activity of the 20S proteasome in Schwann cell lysates, modeling proteostatic stress induced by PMP22 overexpression (CMT1A). It provides a straightforward, large‐scale compatible fluorescent readout (AMC cleavage) and is highly quantitative. However, it is an indirect measure of functional rescue (it does not measure myelination or nerve conduction) and focuses on one arm of protein quality control, potentially overlooking compensatory mechanisms like autophagy. While both assays are scientifically sound, Candidate 1’s direct assessment of the core biophysical defect in CMTX1 offers a more physiologically relevant and interpretable functional endpoint in intact cells.","Candidate 1 is superior because it directly quantifies the primary functional defect (connexin32‐mediated coupling) in Schwann cells, aligning with the disease mechanism in CMTX1. This cell‐based assay captures intercellular communication, a crucial physiological endpoint, and provides direct evidence of therapeutic rescue of gap junction function. Candidate 2, though robust and scalable, measures a downstream biochemical surrogate (proteasome activity) that may not translate as directly to functional myelination or nerve integrity. Thus, for an in vitro strategy prioritizing simplicity, biological relevance, and direct functional readouts, the gap junction coupling assay is the stronger choice.",0,"(2, 6)","{'hypothesis': 'Gap junction coupling assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis gap junction coupling assay employs a dye-loading technique, using well‐characterized dyes such as Lucifer yellow or neurobiotin, to evaluate intercellular coupling via gap junctions in Schwann cells. In practice, cells are mechanically “scrape‐loaded” with the dye, and the subsequent spread of the dye to adjacent cells is quantified by fluorescence microscopy. This measurement serves as a direct readout of gap junction functionality, specifically modeling the impaired intercellular communication resulting from GJB1 mutations that affect connexin32 in Schwann cells—a critical pathogenic event in X‐linked Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease (CMTX1) (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 1-2, cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 2-3).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central role of connexin32, encoded by the GJB1 gene, is well established in maintaining the metabolic and ionic homeostasis of myelinated peripheral nerves through its formation of gap junction channels in Schwann cells. Mutations in GJB1 lead to disrupted connexin32-mediated gap junction communication, which is directly associated with the demyelination and axonal degeneration observed in CMTX1 (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 3-5). This functional impairment is supported by both cellular studies and clinical genetic evidence that highlight the pathogenic significance of GJB1 mutations and the consequential loss of functional gap junction channels (OpenTargets Search: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-GJB1). Clinically, the resultant peripheral neuropathy and episodic neurological dysfunction further underscore the importance of maintaining proper gap junction communication within the peripheral nervous system (zhan2024episodicneurologicaldysfunction pages 8-8).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nDye coupling assays have been extensively utilized in cell-based studies to assess gap junction functionality, and their use in modeling CMTX1 has provided crucial insights into the consequences of mutant connexin32. For example, studies have demonstrated that certain GJB1 mutations result in markedly reduced dye spread in Schwann cell cultures, correlating with disrupted gap junction formation and function (sargiannidou2015intraneuralgjb1gene pages 13-13). Additionally, research investigating novel GJB1 mutations has employed similar assays to confirm that mutant connexin32 leads to intracellular aggregation and stress granule formation, indirectly evidencing compromised gap junction activity (chu2022novelmutationsin pages 17-17). Thus, the established track record of these assays in both understanding disease mechanisms and validating therapeutic interventions provides a strong foundation for their application in drug discovery targeting gap junction repair in CMT.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe major strength of this assay lies in its capacity to provide a direct, quantitative measure of gap junction functionality—a central aspect of CMTX1 pathogenesis. By gauging the extent of dye spread, researchers can assess whether candidate compounds effectively restore or enhance connexin32-mediated coupling in Schwann cells, thereby addressing the core biochemical deficit in the disease (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 1-2). Moreover, the assay is relatively straightforward and employs well-established protocols, making it suitable for medium to high throughput screening of potential therapeutics.\n\nHowever, there are limitations as well. The manual nature of the scrape-loading technique may introduce variability between experiments, necessitating careful standardization and possibly automation to improve reproducibility. Furthermore, while the assay specifically targets gap junction dysfunction, it does not capture other pathological aspects of CMT, such as myelin integrity, inflammatory responses, or axonal survival. Therefore, while this assay is a robust tool for early-stage drug screening aimed at rescuing gap junction dysfunction, it should ideally be complemented with additional assays that address these broader facets of Schwann cell biology and peripheral nerve pathology (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 5-6, cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 6-7).', 'index': '2'}","{'hypothesis': 'Proteasome activity assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay employs measurement of proteasome activity using the chymotrypsin-like cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC in lysates derived from Schwann cells, which are key targets in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT).

Typically, co‐cultures of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–derived sensory neurons paired with Schwann cells (often from rodent sources) are used to recapitulate human axoglial interactions and myelination processes (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nIn CMT disease, peripheral neuropathies manifest due to both demyelination and axonal degeneration, where nodal and paranodal structures play a crucial role in sustaining saltatory conduction. Disruption of nodal integrity leads to conduction slowing and clinical deficits; therefore, assessing the restoration of node organization provides a critical functional readout. This significance is underscored by clinical research which has linked nodal pathology directly to disease severity in peripheral neuropathies (fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7).

The co-culture environment may not fully replicate the in vivo complexity of peripheral nerves. Species differences—such as those between human neuronal components and rodent glia—could add variability to the results (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 10-13). Additionally, while restoration of nodal architecture is indicative of improved myelination, it remains essential to correlate these structural improvements with functional electrophysiological recovery to ascertain true therapeutic benefit (fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7). The assay’s reliance on fixed immunostaining also limits real-time or dynamic assessment of node formation, and variability in culture conditions or antibody specificity might affect assay sensitivity. \n\nIn summary, the nodal domain formation assay represents a valuable and mechanistically relevant platform for early-stage drug discovery in CMT.

Clinically, maintaining proper Ca²⁺ flux is essential to preserve Schwann cell function, and aberrant calcium signaling has been linked to disrupted myelination and axonal support, hallmarks of CMT (vanoye2019peripheralmyelinprotein pages 1-2).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nCalcium flux assays have been widely employed in the investigation of neural cell function and mitochondrial bioenergetics. In multiple studies, fluorescent indicators such as Fluo-4 and ratiometric FRET-based probes have been used to quantify SOCE activity and mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake in neuroblastoma cells and cortical neurons (sanchez2017storeoperatedcalciumentry pages 48-52, sanchez2017storeoperatedcalciumentry pages 42-45). Notably, the re-expression of GDAP1 in deficient cells was shown to restore normal SOCE dynamics, providing strong evidence of the assay's sensitivity in capturing disease-relevant calcium disturbances (sanchez2017storeoperatedcalciumentry pages 60-64). Similar approaches have been implemented in studies evaluating the effects of mutations in proteins such as PMP22 and IP3R3, further supporting the utility of this assay in drug discovery contexts for peripheral neuropathies (vanoye2019peripheralmyelinprotein pages 1-2, terry2022missensemutationsin pages 15-18, vajente2019impactofer pages 27-30).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe major strength of this assay lies in its capacity for real-time, quantitative analysis of Ca²⁺ dynamics, directly linking disrupted ER–mitochondria Ca²⁺ exchange to the bioenergetic deficits observed in CMT. Its application in Schwann cell cultures ensures that the assay is highly relevant to the disease context, providing a functional platform for high-throughput drug screening. Genetically encoded sensors offer the advantage of organelle-specific measurements, allowing researchers to discern between cytosolic, ER, and mitochondrial calcium responses, which is crucial for understanding the multifaceted nature of calcium deregulation in CMT (heredia2020calciumsignalingin pages 2-4, liiv2024ercalciumdepletion pages 13-14).\n\nHowever, potential weaknesses include the variability associated with primary Schwann cell cultures and the technical challenges of accurately measuring rapid calcium flux events in complex cellular environments. Fluorescent assays can be sensitive to artifacts such as dye loading variations and photobleaching, necessitating rigorous controls. Additionally, while calcium flux measurements offer valuable insights into one aspect of CMT pathology, they must be complemented with assays assessing myelin integrity and mitochondrial bioenergetics to provide a comprehensive evaluation of therapeutic candidates (sanchez2017storeoperatedcalciumentry pages 86-89, vajente2019impactofer pages 27-30).\n\nIn summary, given the central role of disrupted calcium homeostasis in CMT, this calcium flux assay constitutes a robust and relevant platform for early-stage drug discovery, enabling the identification of compounds that can restore proper ER–mitochondria Ca²⁺ exchange and ameliorate associated bioenergetic dysfunction."", 'index': '4'}","{'hypothesis': 'Lipid incorporation assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis lipid incorporation assay leverages Bodipy‐labeled fatty acids to monitor the uptake and integration of exogenously supplied lipids into myelin membranes formed in neuron–Schwann cell co‐cultures.

In practice, cells are mechanically “scrape‐loaded” with the dye, and the subsequent spread of the dye to adjacent cells is quantified by fluorescence microscopy. This measurement serves as a direct readout of gap junction functionality, specifically modeling the impaired intercellular communication resulting from GJB1 mutations that affect connexin32 in Schwann cells—a critical pathogenic event in X‐linked Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease (CMTX1) (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 1-2, cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 2-3).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central role of connexin32, encoded by the GJB1 gene, is well established in maintaining the metabolic and ionic homeostasis of myelinated peripheral nerves through its formation of gap junction channels in Schwann cells. Mutations in GJB1 lead to disrupted connexin32-mediated gap junction communication, which is directly associated with the demyelination and axonal degeneration observed in CMTX1 (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 3-5). This functional impairment is supported by both cellular studies and clinical genetic evidence that highlight the pathogenic significance of GJB1 mutations and the consequential loss of functional gap junction channels (OpenTargets Search: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-GJB1). Clinically, the resultant peripheral neuropathy and episodic neurological dysfunction further underscore the importance of maintaining proper gap junction communication within the peripheral nervous system (zhan2024episodicneurologicaldysfunction pages 8-8).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nDye coupling assays have been extensively utilized in cell-based studies to assess gap junction functionality, and their use in modeling CMTX1 has provided crucial insights into the consequences of mutant connexin32. For example, studies have demonstrated that certain GJB1 mutations result in markedly reduced dye spread in Schwann cell cultures, correlating with disrupted gap junction formation and function (sargiannidou2015intraneuralgjb1gene pages 13-13). Additionally, research investigating novel GJB1 mutations has employed similar assays to confirm that mutant connexin32 leads to intracellular aggregation and stress granule formation, indirectly evidencing compromised gap junction activity (chu2022novelmutationsin pages 17-17). Thus, the established track record of these assays in both understanding disease mechanisms and validating therapeutic interventions provides a strong foundation for their application in drug discovery targeting gap junction repair in CMT.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe major strength of this assay lies in its capacity to provide a direct, quantitative measure of gap junction functionality—a central aspect of CMTX1 pathogenesis. By gauging the extent of dye spread, researchers can assess whether candidate compounds effectively restore or enhance connexin32-mediated coupling in Schwann cells, thereby addressing the core biochemical deficit in the disease (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 1-2).

Furthermore, while the assay specifically targets gap junction dysfunction, it does not capture other pathological aspects of CMT, such as myelin integrity, inflammatory responses, or axonal survival. Therefore, while this assay is a robust tool for early-stage drug screening aimed at rescuing gap junction dysfunction, it should ideally be complemented with additional assays that address these broader facets of Schwann cell biology and peripheral nerve pathology (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 5-6, cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 6-7).', 'index': '2'}","{'hypothesis': 'Lipid incorporation assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis lipid incorporation assay leverages Bodipy‐labeled fatty acids to monitor the uptake and integration of exogenously supplied lipids into myelin membranes formed in neuron–Schwann cell co‐cultures.

The central idea is to quantify the degradation capacity of the 20S proteasome complex, as PMP22 overexpression in CMT leads to its misfolding and aggregation, ultimately overloading the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The assay directly measures fluorescent AMC release upon substrate cleavage, serving as a quantitative indicator of proteasomal function. Schwann cell lysates from relevant in vitro models (or animal models such as the C22 mouse model) provide the biological material, ensuring that the readout reflects cellular PQC (protein quality control) dynamics associated with PMP22-induced proteotoxic stress (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 1-2, chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 3-4).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nPathogenesis in CMT, particularly in CMT1A, is tightly linked to an aberrant increase in PMP22 protein levels, leading to its misfolding and aggregation within Schwann cells. The accumulation of misfolded PMP22 disrupts protein trafficking and overloads the proteasome, compromising the cell’s ability to maintain proteostasis. This is central to disease pathogenesis, as proteasomal dysfunction in Schwann cells contributes directly to demyelination and the progression of neuropathy. Multiple studies have demonstrated that reduced proteasome activity, evidenced by decreased cleavage of specific fluorogenic substrates such as Suc-LLVY-AMC, is associated with increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins and misfolded PMP22 aggregates in both CMT models and patient samples (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 10-12, marinko2020directrelationshipbetween pages 1-2). Moreover, the clinical observations of demyelination in CMT patients further emphasize that dysfunction in proteostasis is not only biologically relevant but also clinically significant (lee2012proteinmisfoldingand pages 1-2, patzko2011updateoncharcotmarietooth pages 6-7).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nProteasome activity assays using substrates like Suc-LLVY-AMC have been previously applied to study the progression of proteostatic deficits in CMT models. In these studies, particularly using the C22 transgenic mouse model, researchers observed an age-dependent reduction in proteasomal activity, correlating with increased misfolded PMP22 aggregates and ubiquitin-positive inclusions in Schwann cells (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 6-7, chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 4-6). This approach has been a cornerstone for establishing the link between proteasomal overload and Schwann cell pathology in CMT, thereby validating the assay as a functional readout for therapeutic screening. Its successful use has provided insights into the biochemical pathways by which PMP22 misfolding induces cellular stress and contributes to demyelination.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct measurement of a key biochemical process implicated in CMT pathogenesis. As proteasome dysfunction is a core component of the cellular stress response induced by misfolded PMP22, the assay serves as a robust surrogate marker for testing drugs aimed at enhancing proteasomal capacity or reducing proteotoxic stress. Its quantitative nature and the ability to use primary or immortalized Schwann cell lines also make it amenable to high-throughput formats relevant for early-stage drug discovery (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 1-2, lee2012proteinmisfoldingand pages 3-4). \n\nHowever, there are inherent weaknesses to consider. The assay focuses on one aspect of the complex pathology in CMT, capturing only the proteasomal response to misfolded proteins.

The assay utilizes live‐cell imaging with Mitotracker dyes that selectively stain mitochondria. Automated network‐morphology analysis software is then employed to quantify parameters such as mitochondrial aspect ratio, branch length, and total network connectivity. The measurements derive from high-resolution confocal microscopy images where mitochondrial fusion restoration upon treatment with candidate drugs (e.g., mitofusin activators) would be detected as increased connectivity and elongated mitochondrial morphology (franco2020burstmitofusinactivation pages 2-4, franco2022mitochondrialdysfunctionand pages 1-2). Although many studies have used neurons or fibroblasts, the focus here on Schwann cells is particularly relevant given their key role in peripheral nerve myelination, which is compromised in CMT (almutawaa2020insightsintothe pages 133-136).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nMitochondrial dysfunction, and particularly the loss of mitochondrial fusion, is central to the pathogenesis of CMT2A, the form most frequently associated with MFN2 mutations. Mutated MFN2 impairs the fusion process, leading to fragmented mitochondria, which in turn affect energy metabolism, axonal transport, and cell survival. Clinical correlations have been made between the severity of mitochondrial fragmentation and the progression of neuropathy in CMT patients, emphasizing the importance of mitochondrial network integrity in disease pathogenesis (OpenTargets Search: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-MFN2). Moreover, literature indicates that Schwann cells with MFN2 mutations can exhibit compromised mitochondrial dynamics, which is hypothesized to disrupt peripheral nerve myelination and axonal support (almutawaa2020insightsintothe pages 114-119, schiavon2021impairedmitochondrialmobility pages 1-2). Thus, by directly evaluating mitochondrial morphology, the assay targets a key molecular mechanism of CMT, making it a biologically and clinically relevant tool for therapeutic evaluation.\n\nPrevious Use:  \nMitochondrial morphology assays using live-cell Mitotracker imaging have been extensively validated in preclinical studies investigating MFN2-related neurological disorders. For instance, prior studies have employed such assays in motor neurons and fibroblasts to demonstrate that pharmacological activation of mitofusins can restore normal mitochondrial structure and function (franco2020burstmitofusinactivation pages 6-9, rocha2018mfn2agonistsreverse pages 4-4).

The central idea is to quantify the degradation capacity of the 20S proteasome complex, as PMP22 overexpression in CMT leads to its misfolding and aggregation, ultimately overloading the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The assay directly measures fluorescent AMC release upon substrate cleavage, serving as a quantitative indicator of proteasomal function. Schwann cell lysates from relevant in vitro models (or animal models such as the C22 mouse model) provide the biological material, ensuring that the readout reflects cellular PQC (protein quality control) dynamics associated with PMP22-induced proteotoxic stress (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 1-2, chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 3-4).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nPathogenesis in CMT, particularly in CMT1A, is tightly linked to an aberrant increase in PMP22 protein levels, leading to its misfolding and aggregation within Schwann cells. The accumulation of misfolded PMP22 disrupts protein trafficking and overloads the proteasome, compromising the cell’s ability to maintain proteostasis. This is central to disease pathogenesis, as proteasomal dysfunction in Schwann cells contributes directly to demyelination and the progression of neuropathy. Multiple studies have demonstrated that reduced proteasome activity, evidenced by decreased cleavage of specific fluorogenic substrates such as Suc-LLVY-AMC, is associated with increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins and misfolded PMP22 aggregates in both CMT models and patient samples (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 10-12, marinko2020directrelationshipbetween pages 1-2). Moreover, the clinical observations of demyelination in CMT patients further emphasize that dysfunction in proteostasis is not only biologically relevant but also clinically significant (lee2012proteinmisfoldingand pages 1-2, patzko2011updateoncharcotmarietooth pages 6-7).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nProteasome activity assays using substrates like Suc-LLVY-AMC have been previously applied to study the progression of proteostatic deficits in CMT models. In these studies, particularly using the C22 transgenic mouse model, researchers observed an age-dependent reduction in proteasomal activity, correlating with increased misfolded PMP22 aggregates and ubiquitin-positive inclusions in Schwann cells (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 6-7, chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 4-6). This approach has been a cornerstone for establishing the link between proteasomal overload and Schwann cell pathology in CMT, thereby validating the assay as a functional readout for therapeutic screening. Its successful use has provided insights into the biochemical pathways by which PMP22 misfolding induces cellular stress and contributes to demyelination.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct measurement of a key biochemical process implicated in CMT pathogenesis. As proteasome dysfunction is a core component of the cellular stress response induced by misfolded PMP22, the assay serves as a robust surrogate marker for testing drugs aimed at enhancing proteasomal capacity or reducing proteotoxic stress. Its quantitative nature and the ability to use primary or immortalized Schwann cell lines also make it amenable to high-throughput formats relevant for early-stage drug discovery (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 1-2, lee2012proteinmisfoldingand pages 3-4). \n\nHowever, there are inherent weaknesses to consider. The assay focuses on one aspect of the complex pathology in CMT, capturing only the proteasomal response to misfolded proteins. It may not fully account for other compensatory or parallel degradation systems, such as autophagy, which also modulate proteostasis in Schwann cells (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 6-7, bai2022treatmentwithifb088 pages 12-14). Moreover, while the biochemical readout is valuable, correlating these findings with functional outcomes such as improved myelination or nerve conduction in vivo may require additional complementary assays. Thus, while this proteasome activity assay is a critical tool for evaluating the pharmacological enhancement of protein quality control mechanisms, it should be integrated within a broader panel of assays to fully capture the therapeutic potential for CMT (patzko2011updateoncharcotmarietooth pages 6-7).\n\nIn summary, the proteasome activity assay using Suc-LLVY-AMC in Schwann cell lysates is both scientifically justified and experimentally validated for modeling a critical aspect of CMT pathogenesis and provides a practical platform for early-stage drug screening endeavors.', 'index': '6'}","{'hypothesis': 'Nodal domain formation assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThe proposed assay is a nodal domain formation assay designed to quantify the re‐assembly of nodes of Ranvier in vitro. It models a key aspect of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease pathogenesis by evaluating the restoration of compact myelin and the associated re‐establishment of functional nodal architecture. The assay utilizes immunostaining techniques targeting pan–voltage‐gated sodium channels (pan–Nav) to mark nodes and Caspr to delineate paranodal regions, with subsequent automated image analysis for unbiased node counting. Typically, co‐cultures of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–derived sensory neurons paired with Schwann cells (often from rodent sources) are used to recapitulate human axoglial interactions and myelination processes (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nIn CMT disease, peripheral neuropathies manifest due to both demyelination and axonal degeneration, where nodal and paranodal structures play a crucial role in sustaining saltatory conduction. Disruption of nodal integrity leads to conduction slowing and clinical deficits; therefore, assessing the restoration of node organization provides a critical functional readout. This significance is underscored by clinical research which has linked nodal pathology directly to disease severity in peripheral neuropathies (fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7). Moreover, clinical trial registries such as Clinical Trials Search: (Charcot-Marie-Tooth OR CMT) AND myelin restoration OR node of Ranvier further emphasize ongoing efforts to target these structural domains therapeutically.

For example, co-culture systems described by Clark et al. have successfully employed immunostaining for pan–Nav and Caspr in long-term cultures to reliably quantify nodal assembly as a surrogate marker for myelination integrity (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 10-13). Another study investigating anti-pan-neurofascin antibodies demonstrated that antibody-mediated disruption of nodal components could be quantitatively assessed through similar imaging techniques, providing insights on pathological progress versus therapeutic response (appeltshauser2023antipanneurofascinantibodiesinduce pages 13-13).

The automated quantification minimizes observer bias, thereby allowing high-throughput screening potential and reproducibility across experiments (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, ronchi2023morphologicalmethodsto pages 4-7). Moreover, utilizing human iPSC-derived neurons ensures that the assay has translational relevance; it effectively bridges in vitro findings to clinical scenarios despite the use of rodent Schwann cells in some models.\n\nHowever, weaknesses exist. The co-culture environment may not fully replicate the in vivo complexity of peripheral nerves. Species differences—such as those between human neuronal components and rodent glia—could add variability to the results (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 10-13). Additionally, while restoration of nodal architecture is indicative of improved myelination, it remains essential to correlate these structural improvements with functional electrophysiological recovery to ascertain true therapeutic benefit (fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7). The assay’s reliance on fixed immunostaining also limits real-time or dynamic assessment of node formation, and variability in culture conditions or antibody specificity might affect assay sensitivity. \n\nIn summary, the nodal domain formation assay represents a valuable and mechanistically relevant platform for early-stage drug discovery in CMT. Its ability to quantitatively assess nodal integrity offers a direct functional readout of myelin repair, although its findings must be integrated with complementary functional assays and in vivo validations to fully capture therapeutic efficacy (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7).', 'index': '9'}"

Furthermore, disease modeling studies using hiPSC-derived Schwann cells from CMT patients have highlighted the value of dynamic autophagy readouts in identifying potential therapeutic modulators (mukherjeeclavin2017modelingcharcotmarie pages 45-53, juneja2019challengesinmodelling pages 6-7).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nOne of the major strengths of this assay lies in its ability to provide a dynamic, quantitative measure of autophagic flux, which is directly implicated in the cellular processing of misfolded myelin proteins in CMT. The use of a fluorescent reporter enables live-cell imaging and high-content screening, making it an attractive platform for early-stage drug discovery. Additionally, the assay’s translational relevance is underscored by its successful application in patient-derived cell models that recapitulate aspects of CMT pathogenesis (perrone2019theautophagysignaling pages 18-18).  \n\nHowever, there are several weaknesses to consider. The generation of fully mature and myelinating Schwann cells from hiPSCs remains challenging, which might affect the assay’s physiological relevance (juneja2019challengesinmodelling pages 6-7). Moreover, technical issues such as variability in transfection efficiency and reporter expression, as well as potential photobleaching during fluorescence microscopy, could impact data consistency and assay throughput. Thus, while the assay is robust in measuring autophagic flux, careful optimization and standardization across different cell models will be necessary for its successful application in drug discovery pipelines for CMT (kim2017molecularmechanismsof pages 145-150).', 'index': '5'}"
"(Myelination index assay, 1)","(Calcium flux assay, 4)","Both assays target key aspects of CMT pathology in vitro but differ in their direct biological relevance, throughput, and readout complexity. The Myelination Index Assay directly quantifies Schwann cell–mediated myelin sheath formation on axons via MBP/NF200 immunofluorescence in co-cultures. This provides a highly disease-relevant functional endpoint (the core pathology in demyelinating CMT subtypes), is amenable to semi-automated imaging, and has been validated across multiple systems, including human iPSC-derived neurons. Its primary limitations are culture duration (weeks for robust myelination), variability between cell sources, and the need for secondary validation against in vivo biomarkers. The Calcium Flux Assay measures SOCE and ER–mitochondrial Ca²⁺ exchange in Schwann cells, addressing another mechanistic axis of CMT, particularly in GDAP1-linked forms. It offers rapid, real-time, high-throughput measurements with genetically encoded sensors, yet requires rigorous controls to avoid dye artifacts, may not directly report on myelin integrity, and must be complemented by downstream functional assays of myelination and bioenergetics.","Given the preference for simple, direct functional readouts of disease-relevant endpoints, the Myelination Index Assay is superior. It measures the primary pathological hallmark—myelin sheath formation—in a co-culture context that models Schwann cell-axon interactions. Although slower, it provides a more straightforward and interpretable assay for screening compounds aimed at remyelination, whereas the Calcium Flux Assay, though high-throughput and mechanistically insightful, yields an indirect surrogate endpoint that necessitates further validation to correlate Ca²⁺ dynamics with myelination outcomes.",10,"(1, 4)","{'hypothesis': 'Myelination index assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay utilizes immunofluorescent quantification of myelin basic protein (MBP) relative to neurofilament 200 (NF200) in Schwann cell–neuron co‐cultures. It is designed to model the axoglial interaction critical for peripheral myelination—the process by which Schwann cells ensheathe axons to form a compact myelin layer. In practice, the assay involves culturing Schwann cells together with neurons—these may be derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) or primary sources—and staining them with antibodies against MBP to mark myelin sheaths and against NF200 to label axons. Automated imaging pipelines then quantify fluorescence, providing a myelination index that reflects both the extent and quality of myelin formation (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCharcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is characterized predominantly by demyelination or dysmyelination defects in the peripheral nervous system. Aberrations in myelin integrity and Schwann cell function lie at the core of CMT pathogenesis. The assay’s focus on quantifying MBP relative to NF200 directly models these processes because an effective myelin sheath is a hallmark of healthy peripheral nerve function. Critical research has shown that disruptions in myelin formation, as seen in genetically modified models of CMT (for instance, in CMT4B2), manifest in altered MBP distribution and myelin outfoldings, which this assay can capture (robinson2018aninvitro pages 1-2, scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 2-3). On the clinical side, the standard use of imaging biomarkers to quantify myelin content in patients (e.g., magnetization transfer ratio in MRI studies) underscores the centrality of myelin in both disease progression and therapeutic response (dortch2014proximalnervemagnetization pages 1-2).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nThe myelination index assay has been effectively applied in multiple in vitro systems as a screening tool for pharmacological interventions targeting myelination. Notably, Clark and colleagues developed long-term, stable myelinating co-cultures using human iPSC-derived sensory neurons and rat Schwann cells, showing that immunofluorescence-based measurements of MBP and NF200 yield a reliable readout of myelin sheath formation (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, pages 10-13). In a similar vein, Hyung et al. employed primary motor neuron–Schwann cell co-cultures to demonstrate that MBP immunostaining effectively tracks Schwann cell differentiation and myelin formation, with the assay being sensitive to the effects of neuroactive compounds (hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7, pages 7-9, pages 9-10). Furthermore, in studies focused on CMT models, Robinson and colleagues have used related immunofluorescence quantification methods to evaluate phenotypic myelin abnormalities in Schwann cell-neuron co‐cultures (robinson2018aninvitro pages 6-8).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the myelination index assay include its direct measurement of biologically relevant endpoints. It provides a quantitative, reproducible, and scalable readout of myelin sheath formation that is amenable to high-throughput screening—an advantage for early-stage drug discovery. The system is also flexible, allowing for the use of various cell sources (human, rodent, or iPSC-derived), which can help model both species-specific aspects of myelination and disease-specific phenotypes in CMT (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7).  \nHowever, several limitations must be considered. Variability in the inherent myelination capability of different Schwann cell populations (e.g., human versus rat) can complicate data interpretation and translational relevance (chesnut2021humanipscderivedmodel pages 10-11, chesnut2021humanipscderivedmodel pages 2-4). Additionally, while the assay focuses on mature myelin formation, early-stage changes in oligodendrocyte or Schwann cell differentiation might not be well resolved. Correlation with in vivo endpoints—such as those provided by MRI-based biomarkers—is necessary to fully validate the assay’s predictive power for therapeutic efficacy (dortch2014proximalnervemagnetization pages 1-2). Despite these challenges, the assay remains a promising and credible platform for evaluating drug candidates aimed at restoring or enhancing myelin integrity in CMT (scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 2-3).\n\nOverall, the immunofluorescent MBP/NF200 myelination index assay is scientifically robust and well-grounded in both biomedical and clinical evidence for peripheral demyelinating conditions like Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease.

The central idea is to quantify the degradation capacity of the 20S proteasome complex, as PMP22 overexpression in CMT leads to its misfolding and aggregation, ultimately overloading the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The assay directly measures fluorescent AMC release upon substrate cleavage, serving as a quantitative indicator of proteasomal function. Schwann cell lysates from relevant in vitro models (or animal models such as the C22 mouse model) provide the biological material, ensuring that the readout reflects cellular PQC (protein quality control) dynamics associated with PMP22-induced proteotoxic stress (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 1-2, chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 3-4).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nPathogenesis in CMT, particularly in CMT1A, is tightly linked to an aberrant increase in PMP22 protein levels, leading to its misfolding and aggregation within Schwann cells. The accumulation of misfolded PMP22 disrupts protein trafficking and overloads the proteasome, compromising the cell’s ability to maintain proteostasis. This is central to disease pathogenesis, as proteasomal dysfunction in Schwann cells contributes directly to demyelination and the progression of neuropathy. Multiple studies have demonstrated that reduced proteasome activity, evidenced by decreased cleavage of specific fluorogenic substrates such as Suc-LLVY-AMC, is associated with increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins and misfolded PMP22 aggregates in both CMT models and patient samples (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 10-12, marinko2020directrelationshipbetween pages 1-2). Moreover, the clinical observations of demyelination in CMT patients further emphasize that dysfunction in proteostasis is not only biologically relevant but also clinically significant (lee2012proteinmisfoldingand pages 1-2, patzko2011updateoncharcotmarietooth pages 6-7).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nProteasome activity assays using substrates like Suc-LLVY-AMC have been previously applied to study the progression of proteostatic deficits in CMT models.

Although it only addresses gap junction connectivity and not secondary pathologies, its readout is a direct functional measure of connexin32 channel activity, the primary biochemical lesion in X-linked CMT. Candidate 2 employs a sophisticated microfluidic neuron–Schwann co-culture to monitor mitochondrial transport in axons, which is highly disease-relevant to various CMT subtypes driven by axonopathy. It provides rich, dynamic data on mitochondrial velocity, directionality, and pauses, reflecting both demyelination and transport deficits. However, the assay’s complexity, the need for advanced imaging and kymograph analysis, variable iPSC or primary cell sources, and lower throughput limit its suitability for early-stage therapeutic screening.

In practice, cells are mechanically “scrape‐loaded” with the dye, and the subsequent spread of the dye to adjacent cells is quantified by fluorescence microscopy. This measurement serves as a direct readout of gap junction functionality, specifically modeling the impaired intercellular communication resulting from GJB1 mutations that affect connexin32 in Schwann cells—a critical pathogenic event in X‐linked Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease (CMTX1) (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 1-2, cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 2-3).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central role of connexin32, encoded by the GJB1 gene, is well established in maintaining the metabolic and ionic homeostasis of myelinated peripheral nerves through its formation of gap junction channels in Schwann cells. Mutations in GJB1 lead to disrupted connexin32-mediated gap junction communication, which is directly associated with the demyelination and axonal degeneration observed in CMTX1 (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 3-5). This functional impairment is supported by both cellular studies and clinical genetic evidence that highlight the pathogenic significance of GJB1 mutations and the consequential loss of functional gap junction channels (OpenTargets Search: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-GJB1). Clinically, the resultant peripheral neuropathy and episodic neurological dysfunction further underscore the importance of maintaining proper gap junction communication within the peripheral nervous system (zhan2024episodicneurologicaldysfunction pages 8-8).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nDye coupling assays have been extensively utilized in cell-based studies to assess gap junction functionality, and their use in modeling CMTX1 has provided crucial insights into the consequences of mutant connexin32. For example, studies have demonstrated that certain GJB1 mutations result in markedly reduced dye spread in Schwann cell cultures, correlating with disrupted gap junction formation and function (sargiannidou2015intraneuralgjb1gene pages 13-13). Additionally, research investigating novel GJB1 mutations has employed similar assays to confirm that mutant connexin32 leads to intracellular aggregation and stress granule formation, indirectly evidencing compromised gap junction activity (chu2022novelmutationsin pages 17-17). Thus, the established track record of these assays in both understanding disease mechanisms and validating therapeutic interventions provides a strong foundation for their application in drug discovery targeting gap junction repair in CMT.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe major strength of this assay lies in its capacity to provide a direct, quantitative measure of gap junction functionality—a central aspect of CMTX1 pathogenesis. By gauging the extent of dye spread, researchers can assess whether candidate compounds effectively restore or enhance connexin32-mediated coupling in Schwann cells, thereby addressing the core biochemical deficit in the disease (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 1-2). Moreover, the assay is relatively straightforward and employs well-established protocols, making it suitable for medium to high throughput screening of potential therapeutics.\n\nHowever, there are limitations as well. The manual nature of the scrape-loading technique may introduce variability between experiments, necessitating careful standardization and possibly automation to improve reproducibility. Furthermore, while the assay specifically targets gap junction dysfunction, it does not capture other pathological aspects of CMT, such as myelin integrity, inflammatory responses, or axonal survival. Therefore, while this assay is a robust tool for early-stage drug screening aimed at rescuing gap junction dysfunction, it should ideally be complemented with additional assays that address these broader facets of Schwann cell biology and peripheral nerve pathology (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 5-6, cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 6-7).', 'index': '2'}","{'hypothesis': 'Axonal transport assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis approach employs an axonal transport assay using microfluidic co‐culture systems that compartmentalize neurons and Schwann cells to mimic the peripheral nerve environment. In this assay, neurons (often derived from primary cultures or induced pluripotent stem cells) extend axons into microfluidic channels where they are co-cultured with Schwann cells to support myelination. The assay models disease-relevant demyelination and its impact on mitochondrial motility along axons. Live cell imaging is employed to capture dynamic mitochondrial transport, with quantification performed via kymograph-based analysis. Key measurements include mitochondrial transport velocity, frequency, directionality (anterograde vs retrograde), pause frequencies, and distribution along the axon. This setup directly assesses the transport function of mitochondria and provides a functional endpoint to gauge the efficacy of candidate therapeutics targeting axonal transport and mitochondrial dynamics (sarajarvi2020investigatingcellularpathomechanisms pages 172-178, beijer2019defectsinaxonal pages 12-14).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central pathology in many Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease subtypes involves mutations in genes such as MFN2, GDAP1, NEFL, and others that are critical for mitochondrial function and axonal transport. Defects in mitochondrial mobility lead to energy deficits in distal axons, contributing directly to axonopathy and clinical manifestations of CMT. Demyelination exacerbates these transport deficits by compromising the supportive interactions between Schwann cells and axons, which are essential for maintaining metabolic and trophic functions. Therefore, an assay that quantitatively evaluates mitochondrial transport in a neuron-Schwann cell co-culture is highly relevant, as it directly probes the mechanistic basis of CMT pathogenesis. The biomedical literature underscores that impaired mitochondrial dynamics not only reflect disease severity but also represent a druggable pathway to potentially restore neuronal health, providing a compelling rationale for the use of this assay in early-stage therapeutic screening (schiavon2021impairedmitochondrialmobility pages 1-2, sarajarvi2020investigatingcellularpathomechanisms pages 172-178).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nMicrofluidic axonal transport assays have previously been applied to models of inherited axonopathies, including various forms of CMT. Key scientific advances have been achieved by using these platforms to measure axonal mitochondrial dynamics. For example, studies employing these assays have demonstrated that HDAC6 inhibitors can increase tubulin acetylation, thereby stabilizing microtubules and enhancing mitochondrial transport, which resulted in functional rescue in models of CMT2F (adalbert2019novelhdac6inhibitors pages 1-3). Similar platforms have been successfully used to test candidate drugs by quantifying changes in mitochondrial velocity and distribution, offering mechanistic insights that correlate with improvements in neuronal function. These results support the assay’s applicability to early drug screening efforts in the CMT landscape (beijer2019defectsinaxonal pages 12-14, saporta2015axonalcharcot–marie–toothdisease pages 9-11).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the assay include its physiological relevance by recapitulating the neuron-Schwann cell interactions in a compartmentalized system that mimics the peripheral nerve environment. The live imaging coupled with quantitative kymograph analysis allows for high-resolution measurement of mitochondrial transport parameters, which are directly linked to disease pathology in CMT. Moreover, because the assay focuses on a central aspect of CMT pathogenesis—mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired axonal transport—it provides a direct readout for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions aimed at alleviating these deficits.  \n\nWeaknesses include the inherent variability in cell culture models—differences among primary, patient-derived, and iPSC-derived cells can influence transport dynamics. The technical complexity and requirement for advanced imaging and analysis tools may limit throughput, posing challenges for large-scale screening. Furthermore, while the assay is robust in modeling cellular pathology, its in vitro nature means that additional in vivo studies will be necessary to confirm translation to clinical outcomes.

It measures primary myelin sheath formation—a central pathology in CMT—through automated, high-content imaging. Its strengths lie in direct quantification of myelin, scalability to moderate/high throughput, and the use of human iPSC-derived neurons to capture disease-specific phenotypes. Limitations include variability in myelination capacity across Schwann cell sources and potential blind spots for early differentiation stages. Candidate 2’s nodal domain formation assay immunostains pan-Nav and Caspr to enumerate nodes of Ranvier—critical for saltatory conduction. It provides a mechanistically precise, functionally oriented endpoint and can detect subtle nodal reassembly changes.

Critical research has shown that disruptions in myelin formation, as seen in genetically modified models of CMT (for instance, in CMT4B2), manifest in altered MBP distribution and myelin outfoldings, which this assay can capture (robinson2018aninvitro pages 1-2, scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 2-3). On the clinical side, the standard use of imaging biomarkers to quantify myelin content in patients (e.g., magnetization transfer ratio in MRI studies) underscores the centrality of myelin in both disease progression and therapeutic response (dortch2014proximalnervemagnetization pages 1-2).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nThe myelination index assay has been effectively applied in multiple in vitro systems as a screening tool for pharmacological interventions targeting myelination.

Disruption of nodal integrity leads to conduction slowing and clinical deficits; therefore, assessing the restoration of node organization provides a critical functional readout. This significance is underscored by clinical research which has linked nodal pathology directly to disease severity in peripheral neuropathies (fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7). Moreover, clinical trial registries such as Clinical Trials Search: (Charcot-Marie-Tooth OR CMT) AND myelin restoration OR node of Ranvier further emphasize ongoing efforts to target these structural domains therapeutically.

Moreover, utilizing human iPSC-derived neurons ensures that the assay has translational relevance; it effectively bridges in vitro findings to clinical scenarios despite the use of rodent Schwann cells in some models.\n\nHowever, weaknesses exist. The co-culture environment may not fully replicate the in vivo complexity of peripheral nerves. Species differences—such as those between human neuronal components and rodent glia—could add variability to the results (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 10-13). Additionally, while restoration of nodal architecture is indicative of improved myelination, it remains essential to correlate these structural improvements with functional electrophysiological recovery to ascertain true therapeutic benefit (fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7).

The assay directly measures fluorescent AMC release upon substrate cleavage, serving as a quantitative indicator of proteasomal function.

The accumulation of misfolded PMP22 disrupts protein trafficking and overloads the proteasome, compromising the cell’s ability to maintain proteostasis. This is central to disease pathogenesis, as proteasomal dysfunction in Schwann cells contributes directly to demyelination and the progression of neuropathy. Multiple studies have demonstrated that reduced proteasome activity, evidenced by decreased cleavage of specific fluorogenic substrates such as Suc-LLVY-AMC, is associated with increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins and misfolded PMP22 aggregates in both CMT models and patient samples (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 10-12, marinko2020directrelationshipbetween pages 1-2).

Automated imaging pipelines then quantify fluorescence, providing a myelination index that reflects both the extent and quality of myelin formation (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCharcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is characterized predominantly by demyelination or dysmyelination defects in the peripheral nervous system. Aberrations in myelin integrity and Schwann cell function lie at the core of CMT pathogenesis. The assay’s focus on quantifying MBP relative to NF200 directly models these processes because an effective myelin sheath is a hallmark of healthy peripheral nerve function. Critical research has shown that disruptions in myelin formation, as seen in genetically modified models of CMT (for instance, in CMT4B2), manifest in altered MBP distribution and myelin outfoldings, which this assay can capture (robinson2018aninvitro pages 1-2, scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 2-3). On the clinical side, the standard use of imaging biomarkers to quantify myelin content in patients (e.g., magnetization transfer ratio in MRI studies) underscores the centrality of myelin in both disease progression and therapeutic response (dortch2014proximalnervemagnetization pages 1-2).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nThe myelination index assay has been effectively applied in multiple in vitro systems as a screening tool for pharmacological interventions targeting myelination. Notably, Clark and colleagues developed long-term, stable myelinating co-cultures using human iPSC-derived sensory neurons and rat Schwann cells, showing that immunofluorescence-based measurements of MBP and NF200 yield a reliable readout of myelin sheath formation (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, pages 10-13). In a similar vein, Hyung et al. employed primary motor neuron–Schwann cell co-cultures to demonstrate that MBP immunostaining effectively tracks Schwann cell differentiation and myelin formation, with the assay being sensitive to the effects of neuroactive compounds (hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7, pages 7-9, pages 9-10). Furthermore, in studies focused on CMT models, Robinson and colleagues have used related immunofluorescence quantification methods to evaluate phenotypic myelin abnormalities in Schwann cell-neuron co‐cultures (robinson2018aninvitro pages 6-8).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the myelination index assay include its direct measurement of biologically relevant endpoints. It provides a quantitative, reproducible, and scalable readout of myelin sheath formation that is amenable to high-throughput screening—an advantage for early-stage drug discovery. The system is also flexible, allowing for the use of various cell sources (human, rodent, or iPSC-derived), which can help model both species-specific aspects of myelination and disease-specific phenotypes in CMT (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7).  \nHowever, several limitations must be considered.

Additionally, while the assay focuses on mature myelin formation, early-stage changes in oligodendrocyte or Schwann cell differentiation might not be well resolved. Correlation with in vivo endpoints—such as those provided by MRI-based biomarkers—is necessary to fully validate the assay’s predictive power for therapeutic efficacy (dortch2014proximalnervemagnetization pages 1-2). Despite these challenges, the assay remains a promising and credible platform for evaluating drug candidates aimed at restoring or enhancing myelin integrity in CMT (scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 2-3).\n\nOverall, the immunofluorescent MBP/NF200 myelination index assay is scientifically robust and well-grounded in both biomedical and clinical evidence for peripheral demyelinating conditions like Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. Its established use in co-culture systems and compatibility with automated imaging render it a valuable tool in early-stage therapeutic evaluation, provided that supplementary endpoints and rigorous validation strategies are incorporated to address its inherent limitations.', 'index': '1'}","{'hypothesis': 'Mitochondrial morphology assay', 'answer': ""Assay Overview:  \nThis assay is designed to quantify mitochondrial morphology changes—specifically measuring the balance between mitochondrial fragmentation and fusion—in Schwann cells derived from models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease carrying MFN2 mutations. Since MFN2 is essential for mitochondrial fusion, aberrations in its activity result in fragmented mitochondrial networks, a pathology observed in CMT patients. The assay utilizes live‐cell imaging with Mitotracker dyes that selectively stain mitochondria. Automated network‐morphology analysis software is then employed to quantify parameters such as mitochondrial aspect ratio, branch length, and total network connectivity. The measurements derive from high-resolution confocal microscopy images where mitochondrial fusion restoration upon treatment with candidate drugs (e.g., mitofusin activators) would be detected as increased connectivity and elongated mitochondrial morphology (franco2020burstmitofusinactivation pages 2-4, franco2022mitochondrialdysfunctionand pages 1-2). Although many studies have used neurons or fibroblasts, the focus here on Schwann cells is particularly relevant given their key role in peripheral nerve myelination, which is compromised in CMT (almutawaa2020insightsintothe pages 133-136).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nMitochondrial dysfunction, and particularly the loss of mitochondrial fusion, is central to the pathogenesis of CMT2A, the form most frequently associated with MFN2 mutations. Mutated MFN2 impairs the fusion process, leading to fragmented mitochondria, which in turn affect energy metabolism, axonal transport, and cell survival. Clinical correlations have been made between the severity of mitochondrial fragmentation and the progression of neuropathy in CMT patients, emphasizing the importance of mitochondrial network integrity in disease pathogenesis (OpenTargets Search: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-MFN2). Moreover, literature indicates that Schwann cells with MFN2 mutations can exhibit compromised mitochondrial dynamics, which is hypothesized to disrupt peripheral nerve myelination and axonal support (almutawaa2020insightsintothe pages 114-119, schiavon2021impairedmitochondrialmobility pages 1-2). Thus, by directly evaluating mitochondrial morphology, the assay targets a key molecular mechanism of CMT, making it a biologically and clinically relevant tool for therapeutic evaluation.\n\nPrevious Use:  \nMitochondrial morphology assays using live-cell Mitotracker imaging have been extensively validated in preclinical studies investigating MFN2-related neurological disorders. For instance, prior studies have employed such assays in motor neurons and fibroblasts to demonstrate that pharmacological activation of mitofusins can restore normal mitochondrial structure and function (franco2020burstmitofusinactivation pages 6-9, rocha2018mfn2agonistsreverse pages 4-4). These studies have not only proven the feasibility of quantifying mitochondrial dynamics in vitro but have also directly linked improvements in mitochondrial morphology with functional recovery in disease models. Although the majority of these reports have focused on neuronal cells, the methodological framework is directly transferable to Schwann cells, a cell type highly relevant to CMT pathology (franco2020burstmitofusinactivation pages 24-25).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct measurement of a critical disease mechanism—MFN2-mediated mitochondrial dynamics—which is central to CMT pathogenesis. The combination of live-cell imaging and automated quantitative analysis ensures high throughput, reproducibility, and objectivity, essential attributes for early-stage drug screening. Additionally, this assay provides a phenotypic readout that can be directly correlated with mitochondrial function and potentially with overall cell health, an attractive feature for preclinical studies (franco2020burstmitofusinactivation pages 12-13, franco2022mitochondrialdysfunctionand pages 2-2).  \n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses. The adaptation of this assay specifically to Schwann cells may require further optimization, given that many existing protocols are tailored for neurons or fibroblasts. Moreover, while mitochondrial morphology is a sensitive biomarker of MFN2 activity, it does not capture all aspects of mitochondrial function such as bioenergetics and intracellular signaling, which may also influence disease progression (almutawaa2020insightsintothe pages 133-136). The assay's predictive power for therapeutic efficacy in vivo remains to be fully validated, necessitating complementary functional studies and in vivo assessments in animal models (franco2020burstmitofusinactivation pages 2-4).\n\nIn summary, the mitochondrial morphology assay described is a promising and scientifically robust platform for evaluating drugs aimed at restoring MFN2 function in CMT. While certain technical challenges remain, particularly in optimizing the system for Schwann cells, the assay’s mechanistic and clinical relevance make it a valuable component of early-stage drug discovery pipelines for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease."", 'index': '3'}"

It leverages established mCherry-GFP-LC3 reporters and live-cell imaging, enabling high-content screening of autophagy modulators. However, it requires challenging hiPSC-to-Schwann differentiation or primary Schwann cultures, variable transfection efficiency, and careful standardization to avoid photobleaching and reporter expression inconsistencies. While autophagy is mechanistically implicated in CMT pathogenesis, this assay measures an indirect proxy (degradation pathway) rather than a direct functional endpoint of myelination.

Candidate 2 (Lipid incorporation assay) measures Bodipy-labeled fatty acid uptake and integration into myelin membranes in neuron–Schwann cell co-cultures. It directly quantifies a central pathogenic process in CMT1A—aberrant lipid metabolism and myelin assembly—and captures key neuron–glia interactions in a physiologically relevant context. The fluorescence-based readout is rapid, sensitive, and easily quantifiable, supporting dose–response screening of therapeutic compounds. While focused exclusively on lipid handling, the assay measures a direct functional endpoint (myelin assembly) and uses established co-culture systems, making it broadly accessible in standard labs. Variability in dye uptake and photobleaching can be managed with standardized protocols. Overall, the lipid incorporation assay offers simplicity, speed, and direct biological relevance to myelin function, aligning closely with early-stage drug discovery needs for CMT therapeutics.","Between the two, the lipid incorporation assay (Candidate 2, ID: 8) is superior for early‐stage in vitro therapeutic screening in CMT because it directly measures myelin assembly—a primary functional deficit in CMT1A—using a straightforward fluorescence readout in a relevant co‐culture system. It balances biological relevance, simplicity, and rapid quantitation more effectively than the autophagic flux assay (Candidate 1, ID: 5), which, while informative about proteostatic mechanisms, relies on more complex reporter systems, indirect endpoints, and challenging cell differentiation protocols.",17,"(5, 8)","{'hypothesis': 'Autophagic flux assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThe proposed autophagic flux assay leverages the mCherry-GFP-LC3 tandem reporter to monitor the dynamics of autophagy in Schwann cells affected by Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. In this assay, the reporter is expressed in disease-relevant cell cultures (e.g., primary Schwann cells or hiPSC-derived Schwann cells) to model the impact of MPZ and PMP22 misfolding on proteostasis. The construct allows the visualization of LC3‐positive autophagosomes through the dual fluorescence signals: GFP signal is quenched upon lysosomal fusion due to the acidic environment while the mCherry signal persists, thereby enabling discrimination between autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Quantitative metrics such as puncta count and the ratio of mCherry to GFP fluorescence provide data on autophagosome formation and lysosomal fusion rates. This assay specifically models the degradation pathway implicated in the clearance of misfolded proteins in Schwann cells—a central pathogenic mechanism in CMT (chittoorvinod2015induciblehsp70is pages 1-2, kim2017molecularmechanismsof pages 14-19).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nA substantial body of literature supports that misfolding of myelin proteins, notably PMP22 and MPZ, triggers proteostatic stress, which in turn activates autophagy in Schwann cells. Disruption in protein quality control systems, including the autophagy pathway, is a hallmark of CMT pathology, as abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins contributes to demyelination and Schwann cell dysfunction. Autophagy not only serves as a degradation mechanism to clear misfolded proteins but also influences myelin maintenance and turnover. Elevated autophagic flux has been observed under conditions of proteotoxic stress induced by mutant forms of PMP22 and aberrant MPZ in various in vitro models, emphasizing the mechanistic link between autophagy impairment and CMT disease progression (kim2017molecularmechanismsof pages 28-33, kim2017molecularmechanismsof pages 38-43). Clinically, these molecular perturbations translate into the demyelination and axonal atrophy seen in CMT patients, confirming that targeting autophagy modulation is a therapeutically relevant strategy (miressi2020hereditaryperipheralneuropathies pages 262-265).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nThe mCherry-GFP-LC3 tandem reporter assay is a well-established method employed in various neurodegenerative and neuropathic disease models. It has been used to monitor autophagic flux in patient-derived fibroblasts and hiPSC-derived neurons, notably in studies of Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) where autophagy regulation and mitophagy were carefully quantified (cavaliere2024usinghipscderivedneural pages 56-59, cavaliere2024usinghipscderivedneural pages 37-40). In the context of CMT, research using similar approaches has demonstrated that pharmacological activation of autophagy can ameliorate protein aggregation and improve Schwann cell function. Furthermore, disease modeling studies using hiPSC-derived Schwann cells from CMT patients have highlighted the value of dynamic autophagy readouts in identifying potential therapeutic modulators (mukherjeeclavin2017modelingcharcotmarie pages 45-53, juneja2019challengesinmodelling pages 6-7).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nOne of the major strengths of this assay lies in its ability to provide a dynamic, quantitative measure of autophagic flux, which is directly implicated in the cellular processing of misfolded myelin proteins in CMT. The use of a fluorescent reporter enables live-cell imaging and high-content screening, making it an attractive platform for early-stage drug discovery. Additionally, the assay’s translational relevance is underscored by its successful application in patient-derived cell models that recapitulate aspects of CMT pathogenesis (perrone2019theautophagysignaling pages 18-18).  \n\nHowever, there are several weaknesses to consider.

In these co‐cultures, dorsal root ganglion neurons are maintained in conjunction with Schwann cells derived either from PMP22 transgenic models or patient-relevant sources. Fluorescence microscopy is employed to quantify the Bodipy signal, which directly reflects the efficiency of lipid uptake and incorporation into developing myelin sheaths. Measurements include the intensity and distribution of fluorescence within the myelin membrane, as well as morphometric analyses quantifying the number of myelinated segments as an index of myelin assembly efficiency (abdelaal2019schwanncelldifferentiation pages 68-72, fledrich2018targetingmyelinlipid pages 11-11).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe pathological mechanisms underlying CMT1A prominently involve deficits in lipid biosynthesis within Schwann cells, leading to disrupted myelin composition and consequent functional impairment. Studies have shown that downregulation of key enzymes and transcriptional programs responsible for lipid and cholesterol metabolism directly correlates with aberrant myelin formation in CMT1A (abdelaal2019schwanncelldifferentiation pages 9-14, abdelaal2019schwanncelldifferentiation pages 91-94). Clinical and biochemical literature identifies that proper myelin integrity is critically dependent on a tightly regulated balance of myelin lipids, including phosphatidylcholine and sphingolipids (capodivento2024monitoringmyelinlipid pages 1-2). Moreover, the use of Bodipy-labeled fatty acids in these assays provides a rapid, quantitative readout of lipid handling—a process that is not only central to normal myelin repair but is also severely compromised in CMT1A pathology.

In addition, fluorescent lipid analog assays, such as those utilizing Bodipy-labeled fatty acids, have provided mechanistic insights into the lipid handling abnormalities in CMT models, supporting the use of these methods in drug discovery contexts (prior2023defectiveschwanncell pages 11-14, zhou2019aneutrallipidenriched pages 12-12). Moreover, the assay has demonstrated its translational value by correlating in vitro measures of lipid uptake with improvements in myelination observed in animal models treated with lipid supplementation strategies (chumakov2014polytherapywitha pages 1-2).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the lipid incorporation assay include its direct measurement of a central pathogenic process—namely, the aberrant lipid metabolism and myelin assembly in Schwann cells—which is directly relevant to CMT1A.

The ER stress reporter assay (Candidate 0) is highly scalable, rapid, and uses a simple luciferase readout in Schwann cells to quantify UPR activation. It directly probes a well‐documented mechanism—misfolded PMP22 retention in the ER—enabling high-throughput screening of small molecules that alleviate stress. However, its endpoint is a surrogate marker, not a direct measure of Schwann cell function or myelination, and ER stress is only central in certain CMT subtypes. In contrast, the myelination index assay (Candidate 1) quantifies MBP formation around NF200+ axons in Schwann cell–neuron co‐cultures, providing a direct functional readout of myelination. This endpoint is mechanistically at the core of CMT demyelinating pathology, yielding high biological relevance and translational fidelity. While more complex, time-consuming, and potentially variable across cell sources, automated imaging and robust validation in multiple co-culture systems have shown reproducibility. The myelination index captures a downstream functional phenotype critical to disease progression and therapeutic intervention.","Given the priority for biologically relevant, functional endpoints in CMT and the necessity to measure actual restoration of myelin rather than an upstream stress response, the myelination index assay is superior.

In the assay, pathogenic stimuli—either via overexpression of wild type or mutant peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) or treatment with ER stress inducers like thapsigargin or tunicamycin—activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) and induce the expression of ER stress markers. The luciferase reporter under the control of either the CHOP or BiP promoter provides a rapid, quantitative readout of stress levels by measuring luminescence intensity.

The use of a luminescent reporter system enables rapid screening of compound libraries, making it particularly useful in early-stage drug discovery efforts targeting the ER stress pathway. The biological relevance of using Schwann cells, the primary cell type affected in CMT pathology, further enhances its translational potential (choi2015developmentofcell pages 3-4, volpi2019schwanncellserassociated pages 27-28).

This setup directly assesses the transport function of mitochondria and provides a functional endpoint to gauge the efficacy of candidate therapeutics targeting axonal transport and mitochondrial dynamics (sarajarvi2020investigatingcellularpathomechanisms pages 172-178, beijer2019defectsinaxonal pages 12-14).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central pathology in many Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease subtypes involves mutations in genes such as MFN2, GDAP1, NEFL, and others that are critical for mitochondrial function and axonal transport. Defects in mitochondrial mobility lead to energy deficits in distal axons, contributing directly to axonopathy and clinical manifestations of CMT. Demyelination exacerbates these transport deficits by compromising the supportive interactions between Schwann cells and axons, which are essential for maintaining metabolic and trophic functions. Therefore, an assay that quantitatively evaluates mitochondrial transport in a neuron-Schwann cell co-culture is highly relevant, as it directly probes the mechanistic basis of CMT pathogenesis. The biomedical literature underscores that impaired mitochondrial dynamics not only reflect disease severity but also represent a druggable pathway to potentially restore neuronal health, providing a compelling rationale for the use of this assay in early-stage therapeutic screening (schiavon2021impairedmitochondrialmobility pages 1-2, sarajarvi2020investigatingcellularpathomechanisms pages 172-178).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nMicrofluidic axonal transport assays have previously been applied to models of inherited axonopathies, including various forms of CMT. Key scientific advances have been achieved by using these platforms to measure axonal mitochondrial dynamics. For example, studies employing these assays have demonstrated that HDAC6 inhibitors can increase tubulin acetylation, thereby stabilizing microtubules and enhancing mitochondrial transport, which resulted in functional rescue in models of CMT2F (adalbert2019novelhdac6inhibitors pages 1-3). Similar platforms have been successfully used to test candidate drugs by quantifying changes in mitochondrial velocity and distribution, offering mechanistic insights that correlate with improvements in neuronal function. These results support the assay’s applicability to early drug screening efforts in the CMT landscape (beijer2019defectsinaxonal pages 12-14, saporta2015axonalcharcot–marie–toothdisease pages 9-11).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the assay include its physiological relevance by recapitulating the neuron-Schwann cell interactions in a compartmentalized system that mimics the peripheral nerve environment. The live imaging coupled with quantitative kymograph analysis allows for high-resolution measurement of mitochondrial transport parameters, which are directly linked to disease pathology in CMT. Moreover, because the assay focuses on a central aspect of CMT pathogenesis—mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired axonal transport—it provides a direct readout for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions aimed at alleviating these deficits.  \n\nWeaknesses include the inherent variability in cell culture models—differences among primary, patient-derived, and iPSC-derived cells can influence transport dynamics. The technical complexity and requirement for advanced imaging and analysis tools may limit throughput, posing challenges for large-scale screening. Furthermore, while the assay is robust in modeling cellular pathology, its in vitro nature means that additional in vivo studies will be necessary to confirm translation to clinical outcomes. Overall, however, the assay is a promising platform for early-stage drug discovery in CMT, aligning well with both biomedical and clinical evidence linking mitochondrial transport deficits to disease progression (sleigh2023boostingperipheralbdnf pages 17-18, chamberlain2019mechanismsforthe pages 7-9).', 'index': '7'}","{'hypothesis': 'Lipid incorporation assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis lipid incorporation assay leverages Bodipy‐labeled fatty acids to monitor the uptake and integration of exogenously supplied lipids into myelin membranes formed in neuron–Schwann cell co‐cultures. The assay models a key pathogenic event in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease type 1A (CMT1A)—namely, the disturbed lipid biosynthesis and incorporation that underlies myelin pathology in affected peripheral nerves. In these co‐cultures, dorsal root ganglion neurons are maintained in conjunction with Schwann cells derived either from PMP22 transgenic models or patient-relevant sources. Fluorescence microscopy is employed to quantify the Bodipy signal, which directly reflects the efficiency of lipid uptake and incorporation into developing myelin sheaths. Measurements include the intensity and distribution of fluorescence within the myelin membrane, as well as morphometric analyses quantifying the number of myelinated segments as an index of myelin assembly efficiency (abdelaal2019schwanncelldifferentiation pages 68-72, fledrich2018targetingmyelinlipid pages 11-11).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe pathological mechanisms underlying CMT1A prominently involve deficits in lipid biosynthesis within Schwann cells, leading to disrupted myelin composition and consequent functional impairment. Studies have shown that downregulation of key enzymes and transcriptional programs responsible for lipid and cholesterol metabolism directly correlates with aberrant myelin formation in CMT1A (abdelaal2019schwanncelldifferentiation pages 9-14, abdelaal2019schwanncelldifferentiation pages 91-94). Clinical and biochemical literature identifies that proper myelin integrity is critically dependent on a tightly regulated balance of myelin lipids, including phosphatidylcholine and sphingolipids (capodivento2024monitoringmyelinlipid pages 1-2). Moreover, the use of Bodipy-labeled fatty acids in these assays provides a rapid, quantitative readout of lipid handling—a process that is not only central to normal myelin repair but is also severely compromised in CMT1A pathology. Thus, by directly measuring the lipid incorporation capacity of Schwann cells, the assay reflects the molecular determinants of the disease and offers a robust platform for testing compounds that might restore lipid homeostasis (fledrich2018targetingmyelinlipid pages 1-2, prior2023defectiveschwanncell pages 5-9).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nPrevious studies have applied similar approaches to assess myelination and lipid metabolism. For example, in vitro neuron–Schwann cell co‐cultures have been used extensively to demonstrate that phospholipid supplementation (e.g., with phosphatidylcholine) improves myelin assembly and function, confirming that exogenously supplied lipids can be directly incorporated into myelin membranes (abdelaal2019schwanncelldifferentiation pages 68-72). In addition, fluorescent lipid analog assays, such as those utilizing Bodipy-labeled fatty acids, have provided mechanistic insights into the lipid handling abnormalities in CMT models, supporting the use of these methods in drug discovery contexts (prior2023defectiveschwanncell pages 11-14, zhou2019aneutrallipidenriched pages 12-12). Moreover, the assay has demonstrated its translational value by correlating in vitro measures of lipid uptake with improvements in myelination observed in animal models treated with lipid supplementation strategies (chumakov2014polytherapywitha pages 1-2).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the lipid incorporation assay include its direct measurement of a central pathogenic process—namely, the aberrant lipid metabolism and myelin assembly in Schwann cells—which is directly relevant to CMT1A. The fluorescence-based readout is both sensitive and quantifiable, thus enabling rapid screening and dose-response studies that are essential in early-stage drug discovery. The use of neuron–Schwann cell co‐cultures also recapitulates key interactions within the peripheral nerve environment, thereby increasing the assay’s physiological relevance (abdelaal2019schwanncelldifferentiation pages 68-72, capodivento2024monitoringmyelinlipid pages 1-2).  \nOn the other hand, weaknesses include the fact that this assay focuses exclusively on lipid handling pathways. While these are critically important in CMT1A, other aspects of the disease—such as axonal degeneration and the complexity of in vivo myelin dynamics—may not be fully captured. Additionally, variability in dye uptake or photobleaching may affect reproducibility if not rigorously standardized. Finally, while the assay offers a robust indicator of lipid metabolism–dependent myelination, its predictive power for clinical efficacy must be validated in combination with complementary in vivo models and biochemical markers (padilla2011characterizationofpalmitic pages 169-174, prior2023defectiveschwanncell pages 1-5).', 'index': '8'}"

Though it requires confocal imaging optimization in Schwann cells, the method is conceptually simple, amenable to 96‐well formats, and offers a direct phenotypic endpoint tightly linked to known disease biology. Candidate 2 (Calcium flux assay) addresses ER–mitochondria Ca2+ exchange, a relevant but secondary mechanism in certain CMT subtypes (e.g., GDAP1 mutations). It provides real‐time kinetics of SOCE and compartmentalized Ca2+ handling using fluorescent dyes or sensors. While highly informative for calcium homeostasis, it is more technically demanding—requiring precise dye loading, kinetic imaging, and rigorous controls to avoid artifacts—and focuses on a mechanism less directly connected to the primary MFN2 pathology in CMT2A. Both assays are biologically relevant and support high‐throughput screening, but the morphology assay offers a more direct, simpler, and functionally pertinent readout for drug discovery in MFN2‐linked CMT.","The mitochondrial morphology assay is the superior choice because it directly measures the fundamental defect in MFN2-driven mitochondrial dynamics—the primary mechanism in the most common CMT2A form—using a straightforward, reproducible imaging workflow. It balances simplicity, speed, and biological relevance by providing an automated, quantitative morphological endpoint that correlates with cellular function. In contrast, the calcium flux assay, while valuable for dissecting ER–mitochondria Ca2+ communication, is more complex to implement, prone to technical variability, and addresses a secondary pathology in CMT subtypes, making it less directly suited for broad early‐stage screening of therapeutics targeting the predominant MFN2‐linked disease mechanism.",20,"(3, 4)","{'hypothesis': 'Mitochondrial morphology assay', 'answer': ""Assay Overview:  \nThis assay is designed to quantify mitochondrial morphology changes—specifically measuring the balance between mitochondrial fragmentation and fusion—in Schwann cells derived from models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease carrying MFN2 mutations. Since MFN2 is essential for mitochondrial fusion, aberrations in its activity result in fragmented mitochondrial networks, a pathology observed in CMT patients. The assay utilizes live‐cell imaging with Mitotracker dyes that selectively stain mitochondria. Automated network‐morphology analysis software is then employed to quantify parameters such as mitochondrial aspect ratio, branch length, and total network connectivity. The measurements derive from high-resolution confocal microscopy images where mitochondrial fusion restoration upon treatment with candidate drugs (e.g., mitofusin activators) would be detected as increased connectivity and elongated mitochondrial morphology (franco2020burstmitofusinactivation pages 2-4, franco2022mitochondrialdysfunctionand pages 1-2). Although many studies have used neurons or fibroblasts, the focus here on Schwann cells is particularly relevant given their key role in peripheral nerve myelination, which is compromised in CMT (almutawaa2020insightsintothe pages 133-136).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nMitochondrial dysfunction, and particularly the loss of mitochondrial fusion, is central to the pathogenesis of CMT2A, the form most frequently associated with MFN2 mutations. Mutated MFN2 impairs the fusion process, leading to fragmented mitochondria, which in turn affect energy metabolism, axonal transport, and cell survival. Clinical correlations have been made between the severity of mitochondrial fragmentation and the progression of neuropathy in CMT patients, emphasizing the importance of mitochondrial network integrity in disease pathogenesis (OpenTargets Search: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-MFN2). Moreover, literature indicates that Schwann cells with MFN2 mutations can exhibit compromised mitochondrial dynamics, which is hypothesized to disrupt peripheral nerve myelination and axonal support (almutawaa2020insightsintothe pages 114-119, schiavon2021impairedmitochondrialmobility pages 1-2). Thus, by directly evaluating mitochondrial morphology, the assay targets a key molecular mechanism of CMT, making it a biologically and clinically relevant tool for therapeutic evaluation.\n\nPrevious Use:  \nMitochondrial morphology assays using live-cell Mitotracker imaging have been extensively validated in preclinical studies investigating MFN2-related neurological disorders. For instance, prior studies have employed such assays in motor neurons and fibroblasts to demonstrate that pharmacological activation of mitofusins can restore normal mitochondrial structure and function (franco2020burstmitofusinactivation pages 6-9, rocha2018mfn2agonistsreverse pages 4-4). These studies have not only proven the feasibility of quantifying mitochondrial dynamics in vitro but have also directly linked improvements in mitochondrial morphology with functional recovery in disease models. Although the majority of these reports have focused on neuronal cells, the methodological framework is directly transferable to Schwann cells, a cell type highly relevant to CMT pathology (franco2020burstmitofusinactivation pages 24-25).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct measurement of a critical disease mechanism—MFN2-mediated mitochondrial dynamics—which is central to CMT pathogenesis. The combination of live-cell imaging and automated quantitative analysis ensures high throughput, reproducibility, and objectivity, essential attributes for early-stage drug screening. Additionally, this assay provides a phenotypic readout that can be directly correlated with mitochondrial function and potentially with overall cell health, an attractive feature for preclinical studies (franco2020burstmitofusinactivation pages 12-13, franco2022mitochondrialdysfunctionand pages 2-2).  \n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses. The adaptation of this assay specifically to Schwann cells may require further optimization, given that many existing protocols are tailored for neurons or fibroblasts. Moreover, while mitochondrial morphology is a sensitive biomarker of MFN2 activity, it does not capture all aspects of mitochondrial function such as bioenergetics and intracellular signaling, which may also influence disease progression (almutawaa2020insightsintothe pages 133-136).

These approaches have enabled the identification of compounds that can alleviate ER stress in vitro, with the resulting reduction in reporter activity correlating well with improved cell viability and function—findings that have also informed therapeutic strategies in preclinical models of CMT (scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 17-18).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe strengths of this assay lie in its simplicity, quantitative output, and high-throughput potential. The use of a luminescent reporter system enables rapid screening of compound libraries, making it particularly useful in early-stage drug discovery efforts targeting the ER stress pathway. The biological relevance of using Schwann cells, the primary cell type affected in CMT pathology, further enhances its translational potential (choi2015developmentofcell pages 3-4, volpi2019schwanncellserassociated pages 27-28). However, there are limitations. Given that ER stress may not be a uniform pathogenic mechanism in all CMT subtypes—especially in cases such as CMT1A where primary pathology may involve other cellular mechanisms—the assay may need to be complemented by additional functional assays to capture the full therapeutic profile of candidate drugs (doris2021molecularroleof pages 57-62, doris2021molecularroleof pages 96-99).

In this assay, neurons (often derived from primary cultures or induced pluripotent stem cells) extend axons into microfluidic channels where they are co-cultured with Schwann cells to support myelination. The assay models disease-relevant demyelination and its impact on mitochondrial motility along axons. Live cell imaging is employed to capture dynamic mitochondrial transport, with quantification performed via kymograph-based analysis. Key measurements include mitochondrial transport velocity, frequency, directionality (anterograde vs retrograde), pause frequencies, and distribution along the axon. This setup directly assesses the transport function of mitochondria and provides a functional endpoint to gauge the efficacy of candidate therapeutics targeting axonal transport and mitochondrial dynamics (sarajarvi2020investigatingcellularpathomechanisms pages 172-178, beijer2019defectsinaxonal pages 12-14).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central pathology in many Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease subtypes involves mutations in genes such as MFN2, GDAP1, NEFL, and others that are critical for mitochondrial function and axonal transport. Defects in mitochondrial mobility lead to energy deficits in distal axons, contributing directly to axonopathy and clinical manifestations of CMT. Demyelination exacerbates these transport deficits by compromising the supportive interactions between Schwann cells and axons, which are essential for maintaining metabolic and trophic functions. Therefore, an assay that quantitatively evaluates mitochondrial transport in a neuron-Schwann cell co-culture is highly relevant, as it directly probes the mechanistic basis of CMT pathogenesis.

Key scientific advances have been achieved by using these platforms to measure axonal mitochondrial dynamics. For example, studies employing these assays have demonstrated that HDAC6 inhibitors can increase tubulin acetylation, thereby stabilizing microtubules and enhancing mitochondrial transport, which resulted in functional rescue in models of CMT2F (adalbert2019novelhdac6inhibitors pages 1-3). Similar platforms have been successfully used to test candidate drugs by quantifying changes in mitochondrial velocity and distribution, offering mechanistic insights that correlate with improvements in neuronal function.

The live imaging coupled with quantitative kymograph analysis allows for high-resolution measurement of mitochondrial transport parameters, which are directly linked to disease pathology in CMT. Moreover, because the assay focuses on a central aspect of CMT pathogenesis—mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired axonal transport—it provides a direct readout for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions aimed at alleviating these deficits.  \n\nWeaknesses include the inherent variability in cell culture models—differences among primary, patient-derived, and iPSC-derived cells can influence transport dynamics. The technical complexity and requirement for advanced imaging and analysis tools may limit throughput, posing challenges for large-scale screening.

The construct allows the visualization of LC3‐positive autophagosomes through the dual fluorescence signals: GFP signal is quenched upon lysosomal fusion due to the acidic environment while the mCherry signal persists, thereby enabling discrimination between autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Quantitative metrics such as puncta count and the ratio of mCherry to GFP fluorescence provide data on autophagosome formation and lysosomal fusion rates. This assay specifically models the degradation pathway implicated in the clearance of misfolded proteins in Schwann cells—a central pathogenic mechanism in CMT (chittoorvinod2015induciblehsp70is pages 1-2, kim2017molecularmechanismsof pages 14-19).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nA substantial body of literature supports that misfolding of myelin proteins, notably PMP22 and MPZ, triggers proteostatic stress, which in turn activates autophagy in Schwann cells. Disruption in protein quality control systems, including the autophagy pathway, is a hallmark of CMT pathology, as abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins contributes to demyelination and Schwann cell dysfunction. Autophagy not only serves as a degradation mechanism to clear misfolded proteins but also influences myelin maintenance and turnover. Elevated autophagic flux has been observed under conditions of proteotoxic stress induced by mutant forms of PMP22 and aberrant MPZ in various in vitro models, emphasizing the mechanistic link between autophagy impairment and CMT disease progression (kim2017molecularmechanismsof pages 28-33, kim2017molecularmechanismsof pages 38-43). Clinically, these molecular perturbations translate into the demyelination and axonal atrophy seen in CMT patients, confirming that targeting autophagy modulation is a therapeutically relevant strategy (miressi2020hereditaryperipheralneuropathies pages 262-265).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nThe mCherry-GFP-LC3 tandem reporter assay is a well-established method employed in various neurodegenerative and neuropathic disease models.

In the context of CMT, research using similar approaches has demonstrated that pharmacological activation of autophagy can ameliorate protein aggregation and improve Schwann cell function. Furthermore, disease modeling studies using hiPSC-derived Schwann cells from CMT patients have highlighted the value of dynamic autophagy readouts in identifying potential therapeutic modulators (mukherjeeclavin2017modelingcharcotmarie pages 45-53, juneja2019challengesinmodelling pages 6-7).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nOne of the major strengths of this assay lies in its ability to provide a dynamic, quantitative measure of autophagic flux, which is directly implicated in the cellular processing of misfolded myelin proteins in CMT.

The co-culture environment may not fully replicate the in vivo complexity of peripheral nerves. Species differences—such as those between human neuronal components and rodent glia—could add variability to the results (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 10-13). Additionally, while restoration of nodal architecture is indicative of improved myelination, it remains essential to correlate these structural improvements with functional electrophysiological recovery to ascertain true therapeutic benefit (fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7).

Given that nodal architecture is not only essential for proper nerve conduction but also serves as an indicator of underlying myelin repair and axonal stability, an assay that directly interrogates these domains is highly pertinent for preclinical drug screening.\n\nPrevious Use:  \nThe nodal domain formation assay has been implemented in several key studies for drug discovery and mechanistic characterization in neuropathies. For example, co-culture systems described by Clark et al. have successfully employed immunostaining for pan–Nav and Caspr in long-term cultures to reliably quantify nodal assembly as a surrogate marker for myelination integrity (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 10-13). Another study investigating anti-pan-neurofascin antibodies demonstrated that antibody-mediated disruption of nodal components could be quantitatively assessed through similar imaging techniques, providing insights on pathological progress versus therapeutic response (appeltshauser2023antipanneurofascinantibodiesinduce pages 13-13). Furthermore, the use of automated node counting has been validated as a sensitive method to detect subtle changes in nodal organization, reinforcing its application in screening candidate compounds aimed at restoring node integrity (ronchi2023morphologicalmethodsto pages 4-7).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its high biological relevance since it directly measures a key functional endpoint—node formation—which correlates with restored nerve conduction, a critical requirement for effective therapies in CMT. The automated quantification minimizes observer bias, thereby allowing high-throughput screening potential and reproducibility across experiments (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, ronchi2023morphologicalmethodsto pages 4-7). Moreover, utilizing human iPSC-derived neurons ensures that the assay has translational relevance; it effectively bridges in vitro findings to clinical scenarios despite the use of rodent Schwann cells in some models.\n\nHowever, weaknesses exist. The co-culture environment may not fully replicate the in vivo complexity of peripheral nerves. Species differences—such as those between human neuronal components and rodent glia—could add variability to the results (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 10-13). Additionally, while restoration of nodal architecture is indicative of improved myelination, it remains essential to correlate these structural improvements with functional electrophysiological recovery to ascertain true therapeutic benefit (fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7). The assay’s reliance on fixed immunostaining also limits real-time or dynamic assessment of node formation, and variability in culture conditions or antibody specificity might affect assay sensitivity. \n\nIn summary, the nodal domain formation assay represents a valuable and mechanistically relevant platform for early-stage drug discovery in CMT. Its ability to quantitatively assess nodal integrity offers a direct functional readout of myelin repair, although its findings must be integrated with complementary functional assays and in vivo validations to fully capture therapeutic efficacy (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7).', 'index': '9'}"
"(Gap junction coupling assay, 2)","(ER stress reporter assay, 0)","Both assays leverage Schwann cell biology to address key pathogenic mechanisms in CMT. The ER stress reporter assay uses CHOP/BiP-driven luciferase to quantify UPR activation triggered by misfolded PMP22 or chemical inducers. It is simple, high‐throughput, and provides a quantitative luminescent readout. However, UPR involvement varies by CMT subtype, and baseline ER stress can be minimal in CMT1A models, reducing assay sensitivity and disease coverage. Moreover, luminescence is an indirect surrogate for Schwann cell dysfunction and requires strict optimization to minimize variability. In contrast, the gap junction coupling assay uses scrape‐loaded dyes to directly measure intercellular communication through connexin32 channels. It addresses the core defect in CMTX1, offering a clear functional endpoint and direct disease relevance. This technique is established, moderately scalable, and provides quantitative spatial readouts of coupling efficiency. While manual dye loading can introduce variability and it only applies to GJB1‐linked CMT, the assay’s functional specificity and direct measurement of a validated target mechanism enhance translational potential in early drug screening for CMTX1.","The gap junction coupling assay (Candidate 2) is preferred due to its direct functional measurement of a validated disease mechanism—connexin32‐mediated coupling—in a relevant Schwann cell context. It provides a clear quantitative endpoint, is straightforward to implement, and addresses a monogenic form of CMT with high mechanistic fidelity. Although the ER stress reporter assay (Candidate 0) offers simplicity and high throughput, its reliance on an indirect stress marker and limited applicability across CMT subtypes weaken its translational relevance for broad CMT therapeutic screening.",26,"(0, 2)","{'hypothesis': 'ER stress reporter assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay employs a CHOP or BiP promoter‐driven luciferase reporter in Schwann cells to model the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress component of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) pathogenesis. In the assay, pathogenic stimuli—either via overexpression of wild type or mutant peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) or treatment with ER stress inducers like thapsigargin or tunicamycin—activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) and induce the expression of ER stress markers. The luciferase reporter under the control of either the CHOP or BiP promoter provides a rapid, quantitative readout of stress levels by measuring luminescence intensity. In practice, cultured Schwann cell lines or primary Schwann cells serve as the biologically relevant platform, providing a capable system to detect and quantify small-molecule rescue effects on ER stress levels (choi2015developmentofcell pages 3-4, choi2015developmentofcell pages 4-6).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nBiochemical and biomedical evidence supports that misfolded proteins resulting from PMP22 overexpression or mutation are retained in the ER, leading to significant stress and activation of the UPR in Schwann cells—a key pathogenic mechanism in certain CMT subtypes. Experimental studies demonstrate that mutant forms of PMP22 can induce a dose-dependent increase in ER stress markers (such as PERK, CHOP, and BiP), implicating ER stress as a driver of Schwann cell dysfunction and cell death (choi2015developmentofcell pages 3-4, gutmann2015updateoncharcot–marie–tooth pages 6-7). Moreover, while some evidence suggests that ER stress may not be a primary driver in every CMT context (as indicated in some CMT1A models where baseline ER stress is low; doris2021molecularroleof pages 57-62, doris2021molecularroleof pages 96-99), ER stress clearly plays a pivotal role in the molecular pathology of CMT forms associated with misfolded myelin proteins. Hence, targeting ER stress and the UPR in Schwann cells represents a valid therapeutic strategy, with CHOP and BiP serving as robust surrogate markers reflective of disease modulation (kleopa2023cmt1acurrentgene pages 1-2, scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 22-23).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nER stress reporter assays have been utilized previously in both genetically induced and chemically induced models of ER stress. For example, studies using Schwann cell models have shown that overexpression of mutant PMP22 leads to ER stress induction that is detectable via luciferase reporter constructs under the control of ER stress-responsive promoters (choi2015developmentofcell pages 3-4, choi2015developmentofcell pages 6-6). Additionally, chemical inducers such as thapsigargin and tunicamycin have been employed to mimic the cellular stress seen with pathogenic protein accumulation, providing a stable and reproducible assay for small-molecule screening (chittoorvinod2015induciblehsp70is pages 1-2). These approaches have enabled the identification of compounds that can alleviate ER stress in vitro, with the resulting reduction in reporter activity correlating well with improved cell viability and function—findings that have also informed therapeutic strategies in preclinical models of CMT (scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 17-18).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe strengths of this assay lie in its simplicity, quantitative output, and high-throughput potential. The use of a luminescent reporter system enables rapid screening of compound libraries, making it particularly useful in early-stage drug discovery efforts targeting the ER stress pathway. The biological relevance of using Schwann cells, the primary cell type affected in CMT pathology, further enhances its translational potential (choi2015developmentofcell pages 3-4, volpi2019schwanncellserassociated pages 27-28). However, there are limitations. Given that ER stress may not be a uniform pathogenic mechanism in all CMT subtypes—especially in cases such as CMT1A where primary pathology may involve other cellular mechanisms—the assay may need to be complemented by additional functional assays to capture the full therapeutic profile of candidate drugs (doris2021molecularroleof pages 57-62, doris2021molecularroleof pages 96-99). Moreover, variability in reporter activity across different cell culture conditions could affect reproducibility and necessitate rigorous optimization. Overall, despite these challenges, the ER stress reporter assay constitutes a robust and mechanistically relevant tool for the preclinical evaluation of therapeutics aimed at reducing ER stress and mitigating Schwann cell dysfunction in CMT (gutmann2015updateoncharcot–marie–tooth pages 10-11, scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 22-23).', 'index': '0'}","{'hypothesis': 'Gap junction coupling assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis gap junction coupling assay employs a dye-loading technique, using well‐characterized dyes such as Lucifer yellow or neurobiotin, to evaluate intercellular coupling via gap junctions in Schwann cells. In practice, cells are mechanically “scrape‐loaded” with the dye, and the subsequent spread of the dye to adjacent cells is quantified by fluorescence microscopy. This measurement serves as a direct readout of gap junction functionality, specifically modeling the impaired intercellular communication resulting from GJB1 mutations that affect connexin32 in Schwann cells—a critical pathogenic event in X‐linked Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease (CMTX1) (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 1-2, cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 2-3).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central role of connexin32, encoded by the GJB1 gene, is well established in maintaining the metabolic and ionic homeostasis of myelinated peripheral nerves through its formation of gap junction channels in Schwann cells. Mutations in GJB1 lead to disrupted connexin32-mediated gap junction communication, which is directly associated with the demyelination and axonal degeneration observed in CMTX1 (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 3-5). This functional impairment is supported by both cellular studies and clinical genetic evidence that highlight the pathogenic significance of GJB1 mutations and the consequential loss of functional gap junction channels (OpenTargets Search: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-GJB1). Clinically, the resultant peripheral neuropathy and episodic neurological dysfunction further underscore the importance of maintaining proper gap junction communication within the peripheral nervous system (zhan2024episodicneurologicaldysfunction pages 8-8).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nDye coupling assays have been extensively utilized in cell-based studies to assess gap junction functionality, and their use in modeling CMTX1 has provided crucial insights into the consequences of mutant connexin32. For example, studies have demonstrated that certain GJB1 mutations result in markedly reduced dye spread in Schwann cell cultures, correlating with disrupted gap junction formation and function (sargiannidou2015intraneuralgjb1gene pages 13-13). Additionally, research investigating novel GJB1 mutations has employed similar assays to confirm that mutant connexin32 leads to intracellular aggregation and stress granule formation, indirectly evidencing compromised gap junction activity (chu2022novelmutationsin pages 17-17). Thus, the established track record of these assays in both understanding disease mechanisms and validating therapeutic interventions provides a strong foundation for their application in drug discovery targeting gap junction repair in CMT.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe major strength of this assay lies in its capacity to provide a direct, quantitative measure of gap junction functionality—a central aspect of CMTX1 pathogenesis. By gauging the extent of dye spread, researchers can assess whether candidate compounds effectively restore or enhance connexin32-mediated coupling in Schwann cells, thereby addressing the core biochemical deficit in the disease (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 1-2). Moreover, the assay is relatively straightforward and employs well-established protocols, making it suitable for medium to high throughput screening of potential therapeutics.\n\nHowever, there are limitations as well. The manual nature of the scrape-loading technique may introduce variability between experiments, necessitating careful standardization and possibly automation to improve reproducibility. Furthermore, while the assay specifically targets gap junction dysfunction, it does not capture other pathological aspects of CMT, such as myelin integrity, inflammatory responses, or axonal survival. Therefore, while this assay is a robust tool for early-stage drug screening aimed at rescuing gap junction dysfunction, it should ideally be complemented with additional assays that address these broader facets of Schwann cell biology and peripheral nerve pathology (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 5-6, cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 6-7).', 'index': '2'}"

In these co‐cultures, dorsal root ganglion neurons are maintained in conjunction with Schwann cells derived either from PMP22 transgenic models or patient-relevant sources.

"(ER stress reporter assay, 0)","(Autophagic flux assay, 5)","Both assays model distinct, disease‐relevant stress pathways in Schwann cells, but differ in throughput, simplicity, and direct functional readouts. The ER stress reporter assay (Candidate 0) uses a CHOP/BiP luciferase readout in Schwann cells overexpressing wild-type or mutant PMP22, providing a rapid, quantitative luminescence signal that directly reports on activation of the UPR—a well–validated pathogenic mechanism in CMT subtypes with misfolded myelin proteins. This format is highly scalable, easily standardized, and compatible with primary or immortalized Schwann cells. By contrast, the autophagic flux assay (Candidate 5) employs an mCherry-GFP-LC3 tandem reporter in Schwann cells to measure autophagosome formation and lysosomal fusion. While it yields dynamic, live‐cell measurements of proteostasis and has been used in hiPSC‐derived models, it requires labor‐intensive imaging, faces variability in differentiation and transfection efficiency, and demands high‐content microscopy infrastructure. Both pathways are implicated in CMT pathology, but ER stress is a more direct consequence of PMP22 misfolding in Schwann cells and lends itself to high‐throughput luminescence screening. The autophagy assay offers mechanistic depth but at the cost of complexity, lower throughput, and potential issues in robust Schwann cell maturation.","The ER stress reporter assay is superior for early‐stage drug screening in CMT because it provides a direct, quantitative, high‐throughput readout of UPR activation in disease‐relevant Schwann cells. It is simpler to implement, more reproducible across labs, and directly targets a central pathological mechanism in PMP22‐linked CMT subtypes.

In the assay, pathogenic stimuli—either via overexpression of wild type or mutant peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) or treatment with ER stress inducers like thapsigargin or tunicamycin—activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) and induce the expression of ER stress markers. The luciferase reporter under the control of either the CHOP or BiP promoter provides a rapid, quantitative readout of stress levels by measuring luminescence intensity. In practice, cultured Schwann cell lines or primary Schwann cells serve as the biologically relevant platform, providing a capable system to detect and quantify small-molecule rescue effects on ER stress levels (choi2015developmentofcell pages 3-4, choi2015developmentofcell pages 4-6).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nBiochemical and biomedical evidence supports that misfolded proteins resulting from PMP22 overexpression or mutation are retained in the ER, leading to significant stress and activation of the UPR in Schwann cells—a key pathogenic mechanism in certain CMT subtypes. Experimental studies demonstrate that mutant forms of PMP22 can induce a dose-dependent increase in ER stress markers (such as PERK, CHOP, and BiP), implicating ER stress as a driver of Schwann cell dysfunction and cell death (choi2015developmentofcell pages 3-4, gutmann2015updateoncharcot–marie–tooth pages 6-7). Moreover, while some evidence suggests that ER stress may not be a primary driver in every CMT context (as indicated in some CMT1A models where baseline ER stress is low; doris2021molecularroleof pages 57-62, doris2021molecularroleof pages 96-99), ER stress clearly plays a pivotal role in the molecular pathology of CMT forms associated with misfolded myelin proteins. Hence, targeting ER stress and the UPR in Schwann cells represents a valid therapeutic strategy, with CHOP and BiP serving as robust surrogate markers reflective of disease modulation (kleopa2023cmt1acurrentgene pages 1-2, scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 22-23).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nER stress reporter assays have been utilized previously in both genetically induced and chemically induced models of ER stress. For example, studies using Schwann cell models have shown that overexpression of mutant PMP22 leads to ER stress induction that is detectable via luciferase reporter constructs under the control of ER stress-responsive promoters (choi2015developmentofcell pages 3-4, choi2015developmentofcell pages 6-6). Additionally, chemical inducers such as thapsigargin and tunicamycin have been employed to mimic the cellular stress seen with pathogenic protein accumulation, providing a stable and reproducible assay for small-molecule screening (chittoorvinod2015induciblehsp70is pages 1-2). These approaches have enabled the identification of compounds that can alleviate ER stress in vitro, with the resulting reduction in reporter activity correlating well with improved cell viability and function—findings that have also informed therapeutic strategies in preclinical models of CMT (scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 17-18).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nThe strengths of this assay lie in its simplicity, quantitative output, and high-throughput potential. The use of a luminescent reporter system enables rapid screening of compound libraries, making it particularly useful in early-stage drug discovery efforts targeting the ER stress pathway. The biological relevance of using Schwann cells, the primary cell type affected in CMT pathology, further enhances its translational potential (choi2015developmentofcell pages 3-4, volpi2019schwanncellserassociated pages 27-28).

Candidate 1 quantifies MBP relative to NF200 to directly measure myelin sheath formation, providing a clear functional endpoint that correlates with the pathology of demyelinating CMT subtypes. It is supported by multiple studies in human iPSC‐derived and primary neuron–Schwann co‐cultures, offers automated high‐throughput imaging, and is adaptable to different cell sources to model disease‐specific phenotypes. Its limitations revolve around Schwann cell source variability and the need for complementary differentiation markers and in vivo correlates. Candidate 8 focuses on Bodipy‐labeled fatty acid uptake into myelin membranes to interrogate lipid metabolism deficits characteristic of CMT1A. This method yields rapid, sensitive insights into a central molecular determinant of myelination and therapeutic lipid‐based interventions. However, it captures only the lipid‐handling component of myelin assembly, may suffer from dye uptake variability and photobleaching, and lacks direct measurement of myelin ultrastructure and compaction. While highly relevant for CMT1A lipid biosynthesis defects, its narrow scope limits broader applicability across CMT subtypes and functional myelin assessments.","The Myelination Index Assay is preferred because it measures the end‐product of therapeutic interest—actual myelin sheath formation—using robust immunofluorescent quantification of MBP and NF200. It aligns directly with peripheral demyelination phenotypes, is validated across multiple disease models, and supports high‐throughput drug screens.

It is designed to model the axoglial interaction critical for peripheral myelination—the process by which Schwann cells ensheathe axons to form a compact myelin layer. In practice, the assay involves culturing Schwann cells together with neurons—these may be derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) or primary sources—and staining them with antibodies against MBP to mark myelin sheaths and against NF200 to label axons. Automated imaging pipelines then quantify fluorescence, providing a myelination index that reflects both the extent and quality of myelin formation (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCharcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is characterized predominantly by demyelination or dysmyelination defects in the peripheral nervous system. Aberrations in myelin integrity and Schwann cell function lie at the core of CMT pathogenesis. The assay’s focus on quantifying MBP relative to NF200 directly models these processes because an effective myelin sheath is a hallmark of healthy peripheral nerve function. Critical research has shown that disruptions in myelin formation, as seen in genetically modified models of CMT (for instance, in CMT4B2), manifest in altered MBP distribution and myelin outfoldings, which this assay can capture (robinson2018aninvitro pages 1-2, scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 2-3). On the clinical side, the standard use of imaging biomarkers to quantify myelin content in patients (e.g., magnetization transfer ratio in MRI studies) underscores the centrality of myelin in both disease progression and therapeutic response (dortch2014proximalnervemagnetization pages 1-2).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nThe myelination index assay has been effectively applied in multiple in vitro systems as a screening tool for pharmacological interventions targeting myelination. Notably, Clark and colleagues developed long-term, stable myelinating co-cultures using human iPSC-derived sensory neurons and rat Schwann cells, showing that immunofluorescence-based measurements of MBP and NF200 yield a reliable readout of myelin sheath formation (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, pages 10-13). In a similar vein, Hyung et al. employed primary motor neuron–Schwann cell co-cultures to demonstrate that MBP immunostaining effectively tracks Schwann cell differentiation and myelin formation, with the assay being sensitive to the effects of neuroactive compounds (hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7, pages 7-9, pages 9-10). Furthermore, in studies focused on CMT models, Robinson and colleagues have used related immunofluorescence quantification methods to evaluate phenotypic myelin abnormalities in Schwann cell-neuron co‐cultures (robinson2018aninvitro pages 6-8).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the myelination index assay include its direct measurement of biologically relevant endpoints. It provides a quantitative, reproducible, and scalable readout of myelin sheath formation that is amenable to high-throughput screening—an advantage for early-stage drug discovery. The system is also flexible, allowing for the use of various cell sources (human, rodent, or iPSC-derived), which can help model both species-specific aspects of myelination and disease-specific phenotypes in CMT (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7).  \nHowever, several limitations must be considered. Variability in the inherent myelination capability of different Schwann cell populations (e.g., human versus rat) can complicate data interpretation and translational relevance (chesnut2021humanipscderivedmodel pages 10-11, chesnut2021humanipscderivedmodel pages 2-4). Additionally, while the assay focuses on mature myelin formation, early-stage changes in oligodendrocyte or Schwann cell differentiation might not be well resolved.

In these co‐cultures, dorsal root ganglion neurons are maintained in conjunction with Schwann cells derived either from PMP22 transgenic models or patient-relevant sources. Fluorescence microscopy is employed to quantify the Bodipy signal, which directly reflects the efficiency of lipid uptake and incorporation into developing myelin sheaths.

The assay models disease-relevant demyelination and its impact on mitochondrial motility along axons. Live cell imaging is employed to capture dynamic mitochondrial transport, with quantification performed via kymograph-based analysis. Key measurements include mitochondrial transport velocity, frequency, directionality (anterograde vs retrograde), pause frequencies, and distribution along the axon. This setup directly assesses the transport function of mitochondria and provides a functional endpoint to gauge the efficacy of candidate therapeutics targeting axonal transport and mitochondrial dynamics (sarajarvi2020investigatingcellularpathomechanisms pages 172-178, beijer2019defectsinaxonal pages 12-14).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central pathology in many Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease subtypes involves mutations in genes such as MFN2, GDAP1, NEFL, and others that are critical for mitochondrial function and axonal transport. Defects in mitochondrial mobility lead to energy deficits in distal axons, contributing directly to axonopathy and clinical manifestations of CMT. Demyelination exacerbates these transport deficits by compromising the supportive interactions between Schwann cells and axons, which are essential for maintaining metabolic and trophic functions. Therefore, an assay that quantitatively evaluates mitochondrial transport in a neuron-Schwann cell co-culture is highly relevant, as it directly probes the mechanistic basis of CMT pathogenesis.

The assay utilizes immunostaining techniques targeting pan–voltage‐gated sodium channels (pan–Nav) to mark nodes and Caspr to delineate paranodal regions, with subsequent automated image analysis for unbiased node counting. Typically, co‐cultures of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–derived sensory neurons paired with Schwann cells (often from rodent sources) are used to recapitulate human axoglial interactions and myelination processes (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nIn CMT disease, peripheral neuropathies manifest due to both demyelination and axonal degeneration, where nodal and paranodal structures play a crucial role in sustaining saltatory conduction. Disruption of nodal integrity leads to conduction slowing and clinical deficits; therefore, assessing the restoration of node organization provides a critical functional readout. This significance is underscored by clinical research which has linked nodal pathology directly to disease severity in peripheral neuropathies (fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7). Moreover, clinical trial registries such as Clinical Trials Search: (Charcot-Marie-Tooth OR CMT) AND myelin restoration OR node of Ranvier further emphasize ongoing efforts to target these structural domains therapeutically.

The automated quantification minimizes observer bias, thereby allowing high-throughput screening potential and reproducibility across experiments (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, ronchi2023morphologicalmethodsto pages 4-7). Moreover, utilizing human iPSC-derived neurons ensures that the assay has translational relevance; it effectively bridges in vitro findings to clinical scenarios despite the use of rodent Schwann cells in some models.\n\nHowever, weaknesses exist. The co-culture environment may not fully replicate the in vivo complexity of peripheral nerves. Species differences—such as those between human neuronal components and rodent glia—could add variability to the results (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 10-13). Additionally, while restoration of nodal architecture is indicative of improved myelination, it remains essential to correlate these structural improvements with functional electrophysiological recovery to ascertain true therapeutic benefit (fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7).

In practice, the assay involves culturing Schwann cells together with neurons—these may be derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) or primary sources—and staining them with antibodies against MBP to mark myelin sheaths and against NF200 to label axons. Automated imaging pipelines then quantify fluorescence, providing a myelination index that reflects both the extent and quality of myelin formation (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCharcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is characterized predominantly by demyelination or dysmyelination defects in the peripheral nervous system. Aberrations in myelin integrity and Schwann cell function lie at the core of CMT pathogenesis.

Disruption in protein quality control systems, including the autophagy pathway, is a hallmark of CMT pathology, as abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins contributes to demyelination and Schwann cell dysfunction. Autophagy not only serves as a degradation mechanism to clear misfolded proteins but also influences myelin maintenance and turnover. Elevated autophagic flux has been observed under conditions of proteotoxic stress induced by mutant forms of PMP22 and aberrant MPZ in various in vitro models, emphasizing the mechanistic link between autophagy impairment and CMT disease progression (kim2017molecularmechanismsof pages 28-33, kim2017molecularmechanismsof pages 38-43).

It is grounded in extensive literature showing that MBP/NF200 immunofluorescence correlates with functional myelination (clark2017; hyung2015; robinson2018) and aligns with clinical MRI‐based myelin biomarkers (dortch2014). The assay is adaptable to human or rodent cells (including patient‐derived iPSCs), automated for reproducibility, and scalable for moderate‐to‐high throughput screening. Limitations include co‐culture variability, especially across species, and the requirement for weeks‐long myelination, but these are offset by its direct readout of a key functional endpoint.

It is designed to model the axoglial interaction critical for peripheral myelination—the process by which Schwann cells ensheathe axons to form a compact myelin layer. In practice, the assay involves culturing Schwann cells together with neurons—these may be derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) or primary sources—and staining them with antibodies against MBP to mark myelin sheaths and against NF200 to label axons. Automated imaging pipelines then quantify fluorescence, providing a myelination index that reflects both the extent and quality of myelin formation (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCharcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is characterized predominantly by demyelination or dysmyelination defects in the peripheral nervous system. Aberrations in myelin integrity and Schwann cell function lie at the core of CMT pathogenesis. The assay’s focus on quantifying MBP relative to NF200 directly models these processes because an effective myelin sheath is a hallmark of healthy peripheral nerve function. Critical research has shown that disruptions in myelin formation, as seen in genetically modified models of CMT (for instance, in CMT4B2), manifest in altered MBP distribution and myelin outfoldings, which this assay can capture (robinson2018aninvitro pages 1-2, scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 2-3). On the clinical side, the standard use of imaging biomarkers to quantify myelin content in patients (e.g., magnetization transfer ratio in MRI studies) underscores the centrality of myelin in both disease progression and therapeutic response (dortch2014proximalnervemagnetization pages 1-2).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nThe myelination index assay has been effectively applied in multiple in vitro systems as a screening tool for pharmacological interventions targeting myelination. Notably, Clark and colleagues developed long-term, stable myelinating co-cultures using human iPSC-derived sensory neurons and rat Schwann cells, showing that immunofluorescence-based measurements of MBP and NF200 yield a reliable readout of myelin sheath formation (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, pages 10-13). In a similar vein, Hyung et al. employed primary motor neuron–Schwann cell co-cultures to demonstrate that MBP immunostaining effectively tracks Schwann cell differentiation and myelin formation, with the assay being sensitive to the effects of neuroactive compounds (hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7, pages 7-9, pages 9-10). Furthermore, in studies focused on CMT models, Robinson and colleagues have used related immunofluorescence quantification methods to evaluate phenotypic myelin abnormalities in Schwann cell-neuron co‐cultures (robinson2018aninvitro pages 6-8).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the myelination index assay include its direct measurement of biologically relevant endpoints. It provides a quantitative, reproducible, and scalable readout of myelin sheath formation that is amenable to high-throughput screening—an advantage for early-stage drug discovery. The system is also flexible, allowing for the use of various cell sources (human, rodent, or iPSC-derived), which can help model both species-specific aspects of myelination and disease-specific phenotypes in CMT (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7).  \nHowever, several limitations must be considered. Variability in the inherent myelination capability of different Schwann cell populations (e.g., human versus rat) can complicate data interpretation and translational relevance (chesnut2021humanipscderivedmodel pages 10-11, chesnut2021humanipscderivedmodel pages 2-4).

The luciferase reporter under the control of either the CHOP or BiP promoter provides a rapid, quantitative readout of stress levels by measuring luminescence intensity.

Overall, despite these challenges, the ER stress reporter assay constitutes a robust and mechanistically relevant tool for the preclinical evaluation of therapeutics aimed at reducing ER stress and mitigating Schwann cell dysfunction in CMT (gutmann2015updateoncharcot–marie–tooth pages 10-11, scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 22-23).', 'index': '0'}","{'hypothesis': 'Proteasome activity assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay employs measurement of proteasome activity using the chymotrypsin-like cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC in lysates derived from Schwann cells, which are key targets in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT). The central idea is to quantify the degradation capacity of the 20S proteasome complex, as PMP22 overexpression in CMT leads to its misfolding and aggregation, ultimately overloading the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The assay directly measures fluorescent AMC release upon substrate cleavage, serving as a quantitative indicator of proteasomal function. Schwann cell lysates from relevant in vitro models (or animal models such as the C22 mouse model) provide the biological material, ensuring that the readout reflects cellular PQC (protein quality control) dynamics associated with PMP22-induced proteotoxic stress (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 1-2, chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 3-4).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nPathogenesis in CMT, particularly in CMT1A, is tightly linked to an aberrant increase in PMP22 protein levels, leading to its misfolding and aggregation within Schwann cells. The accumulation of misfolded PMP22 disrupts protein trafficking and overloads the proteasome, compromising the cell’s ability to maintain proteostasis. This is central to disease pathogenesis, as proteasomal dysfunction in Schwann cells contributes directly to demyelination and the progression of neuropathy. Multiple studies have demonstrated that reduced proteasome activity, evidenced by decreased cleavage of specific fluorogenic substrates such as Suc-LLVY-AMC, is associated with increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins and misfolded PMP22 aggregates in both CMT models and patient samples (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 10-12, marinko2020directrelationshipbetween pages 1-2). Moreover, the clinical observations of demyelination in CMT patients further emphasize that dysfunction in proteostasis is not only biologically relevant but also clinically significant (lee2012proteinmisfoldingand pages 1-2, patzko2011updateoncharcotmarietooth pages 6-7).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nProteasome activity assays using substrates like Suc-LLVY-AMC have been previously applied to study the progression of proteostatic deficits in CMT models. In these studies, particularly using the C22 transgenic mouse model, researchers observed an age-dependent reduction in proteasomal activity, correlating with increased misfolded PMP22 aggregates and ubiquitin-positive inclusions in Schwann cells (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 6-7, chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 4-6). This approach has been a cornerstone for establishing the link between proteasomal overload and Schwann cell pathology in CMT, thereby validating the assay as a functional readout for therapeutic screening. Its successful use has provided insights into the biochemical pathways by which PMP22 misfolding induces cellular stress and contributes to demyelination.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct measurement of a key biochemical process implicated in CMT pathogenesis. As proteasome dysfunction is a core component of the cellular stress response induced by misfolded PMP22, the assay serves as a robust surrogate marker for testing drugs aimed at enhancing proteasomal capacity or reducing proteotoxic stress. Its quantitative nature and the ability to use primary or immortalized Schwann cell lines also make it amenable to high-throughput formats relevant for early-stage drug discovery (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 1-2, lee2012proteinmisfoldingand pages 3-4). \n\nHowever, there are inherent weaknesses to consider. The assay focuses on one aspect of the complex pathology in CMT, capturing only the proteasomal response to misfolded proteins. It may not fully account for other compensatory or parallel degradation systems, such as autophagy, which also modulate proteostasis in Schwann cells (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 6-7, bai2022treatmentwithifb088 pages 12-14). Moreover, while the biochemical readout is valuable, correlating these findings with functional outcomes such as improved myelination or nerve conduction in vivo may require additional complementary assays. Thus, while this proteasome activity assay is a critical tool for evaluating the pharmacological enhancement of protein quality control mechanisms, it should be integrated within a broader panel of assays to fully capture the therapeutic potential for CMT (patzko2011updateoncharcotmarietooth pages 6-7).\n\nIn summary, the proteasome activity assay using Suc-LLVY-AMC in Schwann cell lysates is both scientifically justified and experimentally validated for modeling a critical aspect of CMT pathogenesis and provides a practical platform for early-stage drug screening endeavors.', 'index': '6'}"
"(Myelination index assay, 1)","(Axonal transport assay, 7)","Both assays model key aspects of Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) pathology in vitro but differ in complexity, throughput, and the immediacy of their functional readouts. The Myelination Index Assay (ID 1) uses Schwann cell–neuron co‐cultures and automated immunofluorescent quantification of MBP vs NF200 to directly measure myelin sheath formation. It is rooted in the primary demyelinating phenotype of many CMT subtypes, uses established markers (MBP, NF200), and leverages high‐content imaging pipelines that are widely available in standard labs. The assay’s major advantages are its direct relevance to peripheral nerve function, compatibility with multiple cell sources (iPSC‐derived or primary), and amenability to higher throughput screening. Its limitations include variability across Schwann cell sources and the extended culture time required for robust myelination, which can span several weeks. The Axonal Transport Assay (ID 7) employs microfluidic compartmentalization to measure mitochondrial motility via live imaging and kymograph analysis. It interrogates a critical, mechanistic CMT pathway—impaired mitochondrial transport in axons—and can yield dynamic, quantitative data more rapidly (once axonal outgrowth is established). However, it requires specialized microfluidic devices, advanced live‐cell imaging infrastructure, and sophisticated image‐analysis workflows, which limits throughput and adoption. Moreover, it addresses a downstream consequence of demyelination/axonopathy rather than the primary myelin integrity deficit in many CMT forms. While both assays are scientifically robust, the Myelination Index Assay better aligns with the core demyelinating hallmark of CMT, is simpler to implement in standard drug discovery settings, and supports higher‐throughput screening of compounds that directly modulate Schwann cell–axon interactions.","The Myelination Index Assay (ID 1) is preferable because it directly quantifies the principal pathological feature of CMT—peripheral demyelination—using well‐validated markers in a co‐culture format that is broadly implementable. It combines biological relevance with quantitative, automated readouts that can scale for early‐stage drug screening. In contrast, while the Axonal Transport Assay (ID 7) offers mechanistic insights into mitochondrial dynamics, it demands specialized microfluidic platforms, lengthy setup for axonal extension, and complex imaging/analysis pipelines, reducing throughput and generalizability.

It is designed to model the axoglial interaction critical for peripheral myelination—the process by which Schwann cells ensheathe axons to form a compact myelin layer. In practice, the assay involves culturing Schwann cells together with neurons—these may be derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) or primary sources—and staining them with antibodies against MBP to mark myelin sheaths and against NF200 to label axons. Automated imaging pipelines then quantify fluorescence, providing a myelination index that reflects both the extent and quality of myelin formation (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nCharcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is characterized predominantly by demyelination or dysmyelination defects in the peripheral nervous system. Aberrations in myelin integrity and Schwann cell function lie at the core of CMT pathogenesis. The assay’s focus on quantifying MBP relative to NF200 directly models these processes because an effective myelin sheath is a hallmark of healthy peripheral nerve function. Critical research has shown that disruptions in myelin formation, as seen in genetically modified models of CMT (for instance, in CMT4B2), manifest in altered MBP distribution and myelin outfoldings, which this assay can capture (robinson2018aninvitro pages 1-2, scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 2-3). On the clinical side, the standard use of imaging biomarkers to quantify myelin content in patients (e.g., magnetization transfer ratio in MRI studies) underscores the centrality of myelin in both disease progression and therapeutic response (dortch2014proximalnervemagnetization pages 1-2).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nThe myelination index assay has been effectively applied in multiple in vitro systems as a screening tool for pharmacological interventions targeting myelination. Notably, Clark and colleagues developed long-term, stable myelinating co-cultures using human iPSC-derived sensory neurons and rat Schwann cells, showing that immunofluorescence-based measurements of MBP and NF200 yield a reliable readout of myelin sheath formation (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, pages 10-13). In a similar vein, Hyung et al. employed primary motor neuron–Schwann cell co-cultures to demonstrate that MBP immunostaining effectively tracks Schwann cell differentiation and myelin formation, with the assay being sensitive to the effects of neuroactive compounds (hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7, pages 7-9, pages 9-10). Furthermore, in studies focused on CMT models, Robinson and colleagues have used related immunofluorescence quantification methods to evaluate phenotypic myelin abnormalities in Schwann cell-neuron co‐cultures (robinson2018aninvitro pages 6-8).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the myelination index assay include its direct measurement of biologically relevant endpoints. It provides a quantitative, reproducible, and scalable readout of myelin sheath formation that is amenable to high-throughput screening—an advantage for early-stage drug discovery. The system is also flexible, allowing for the use of various cell sources (human, rodent, or iPSC-derived), which can help model both species-specific aspects of myelination and disease-specific phenotypes in CMT (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, hyung2015cocultureofprimary pages 5-7).  \nHowever, several limitations must be considered. Variability in the inherent myelination capability of different Schwann cell populations (e.g., human versus rat) can complicate data interpretation and translational relevance (chesnut2021humanipscderivedmodel pages 10-11, chesnut2021humanipscderivedmodel pages 2-4). Additionally, while the assay focuses on mature myelin formation, early-stage changes in oligodendrocyte or Schwann cell differentiation might not be well resolved. Correlation with in vivo endpoints—such as those provided by MRI-based biomarkers—is necessary to fully validate the assay’s predictive power for therapeutic efficacy (dortch2014proximalnervemagnetization pages 1-2). Despite these challenges, the assay remains a promising and credible platform for evaluating drug candidates aimed at restoring or enhancing myelin integrity in CMT (scapin2019enhancedaxonalneuregulin1 pages 2-3).\n\nOverall, the immunofluorescent MBP/NF200 myelination index assay is scientifically robust and well-grounded in both biomedical and clinical evidence for peripheral demyelinating conditions like Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease.

The assay models disease-relevant demyelination and its impact on mitochondrial motility along axons. Live cell imaging is employed to capture dynamic mitochondrial transport, with quantification performed via kymograph-based analysis. Key measurements include mitochondrial transport velocity, frequency, directionality (anterograde vs retrograde), pause frequencies, and distribution along the axon. This setup directly assesses the transport function of mitochondria and provides a functional endpoint to gauge the efficacy of candidate therapeutics targeting axonal transport and mitochondrial dynamics (sarajarvi2020investigatingcellularpathomechanisms pages 172-178, beijer2019defectsinaxonal pages 12-14).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central pathology in many Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease subtypes involves mutations in genes such as MFN2, GDAP1, NEFL, and others that are critical for mitochondrial function and axonal transport. Defects in mitochondrial mobility lead to energy deficits in distal axons, contributing directly to axonopathy and clinical manifestations of CMT. Demyelination exacerbates these transport deficits by compromising the supportive interactions between Schwann cells and axons, which are essential for maintaining metabolic and trophic functions. Therefore, an assay that quantitatively evaluates mitochondrial transport in a neuron-Schwann cell co-culture is highly relevant, as it directly probes the mechanistic basis of CMT pathogenesis. The biomedical literature underscores that impaired mitochondrial dynamics not only reflect disease severity but also represent a druggable pathway to potentially restore neuronal health, providing a compelling rationale for the use of this assay in early-stage therapeutic screening (schiavon2021impairedmitochondrialmobility pages 1-2, sarajarvi2020investigatingcellularpathomechanisms pages 172-178).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nMicrofluidic axonal transport assays have previously been applied to models of inherited axonopathies, including various forms of CMT. Key scientific advances have been achieved by using these platforms to measure axonal mitochondrial dynamics. For example, studies employing these assays have demonstrated that HDAC6 inhibitors can increase tubulin acetylation, thereby stabilizing microtubules and enhancing mitochondrial transport, which resulted in functional rescue in models of CMT2F (adalbert2019novelhdac6inhibitors pages 1-3). Similar platforms have been successfully used to test candidate drugs by quantifying changes in mitochondrial velocity and distribution, offering mechanistic insights that correlate with improvements in neuronal function. These results support the assay’s applicability to early drug screening efforts in the CMT landscape (beijer2019defectsinaxonal pages 12-14, saporta2015axonalcharcot–marie–toothdisease pages 9-11).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the assay include its physiological relevance by recapitulating the neuron-Schwann cell interactions in a compartmentalized system that mimics the peripheral nerve environment.

This measurement serves as a direct readout of gap junction functionality, specifically modeling the impaired intercellular communication resulting from GJB1 mutations that affect connexin32 in Schwann cells—a critical pathogenic event in X‐linked Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease (CMTX1) (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 1-2, cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 2-3).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central role of connexin32, encoded by the GJB1 gene, is well established in maintaining the metabolic and ionic homeostasis of myelinated peripheral nerves through its formation of gap junction channels in Schwann cells. Mutations in GJB1 lead to disrupted connexin32-mediated gap junction communication, which is directly associated with the demyelination and axonal degeneration observed in CMTX1 (cisterna2019roleofconnexinbased pages 3-5). This functional impairment is supported by both cellular studies and clinical genetic evidence that highlight the pathogenic significance of GJB1 mutations and the consequential loss of functional gap junction channels (OpenTargets Search: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-GJB1).

The central idea is to quantify the degradation capacity of the 20S proteasome complex, as PMP22 overexpression in CMT leads to its misfolding and aggregation, ultimately overloading the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The assay directly measures fluorescent AMC release upon substrate cleavage, serving as a quantitative indicator of proteasomal function. Schwann cell lysates from relevant in vitro models (or animal models such as the C22 mouse model) provide the biological material, ensuring that the readout reflects cellular PQC (protein quality control) dynamics associated with PMP22-induced proteotoxic stress (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 1-2, chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 3-4).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nPathogenesis in CMT, particularly in CMT1A, is tightly linked to an aberrant increase in PMP22 protein levels, leading to its misfolding and aggregation within Schwann cells. The accumulation of misfolded PMP22 disrupts protein trafficking and overloads the proteasome, compromising the cell’s ability to maintain proteostasis. This is central to disease pathogenesis, as proteasomal dysfunction in Schwann cells contributes directly to demyelination and the progression of neuropathy. Multiple studies have demonstrated that reduced proteasome activity, evidenced by decreased cleavage of specific fluorogenic substrates such as Suc-LLVY-AMC, is associated with increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins and misfolded PMP22 aggregates in both CMT models and patient samples (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 10-12, marinko2020directrelationshipbetween pages 1-2). Moreover, the clinical observations of demyelination in CMT patients further emphasize that dysfunction in proteostasis is not only biologically relevant but also clinically significant (lee2012proteinmisfoldingand pages 1-2, patzko2011updateoncharcotmarietooth pages 6-7).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nProteasome activity assays using substrates like Suc-LLVY-AMC have been previously applied to study the progression of proteostatic deficits in CMT models.

This approach has been a cornerstone for establishing the link between proteasomal overload and Schwann cell pathology in CMT, thereby validating the assay as a functional readout for therapeutic screening. Its successful use has provided insights into the biochemical pathways by which PMP22 misfolding induces cellular stress and contributes to demyelination.\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its direct measurement of a key biochemical process implicated in CMT pathogenesis. As proteasome dysfunction is a core component of the cellular stress response induced by misfolded PMP22, the assay serves as a robust surrogate marker for testing drugs aimed at enhancing proteasomal capacity or reducing proteotoxic stress. Its quantitative nature and the ability to use primary or immortalized Schwann cell lines also make it amenable to high-throughput formats relevant for early-stage drug discovery (chittoor2013biochemicalcharacterizationof pages 1-2, lee2012proteinmisfoldingand pages 3-4). \n\nHowever, there are inherent weaknesses to consider. The assay focuses on one aspect of the complex pathology in CMT, capturing only the proteasomal response to misfolded proteins.

Another study investigating anti-pan-neurofascin antibodies demonstrated that antibody-mediated disruption of nodal components could be quantitatively assessed through similar imaging techniques, providing insights on pathological progress versus therapeutic response (appeltshauser2023antipanneurofascinantibodiesinduce pages 13-13). Furthermore, the use of automated node counting has been validated as a sensitive method to detect subtle changes in nodal organization, reinforcing its application in screening candidate compounds aimed at restoring node integrity (ronchi2023morphologicalmethodsto pages 4-7).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its high biological relevance since it directly measures a key functional endpoint—node formation—which correlates with restored nerve conduction, a critical requirement for effective therapies in CMT. The automated quantification minimizes observer bias, thereby allowing high-throughput screening potential and reproducibility across experiments (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, ronchi2023morphologicalmethodsto pages 4-7). Moreover, utilizing human iPSC-derived neurons ensures that the assay has translational relevance; it effectively bridges in vitro findings to clinical scenarios despite the use of rodent Schwann cells in some models.\n\nHowever, weaknesses exist. The co-culture environment may not fully replicate the in vivo complexity of peripheral nerves. Species differences—such as those between human neuronal components and rodent glia—could add variability to the results (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 10-13). Additionally, while restoration of nodal architecture is indicative of improved myelination, it remains essential to correlate these structural improvements with functional electrophysiological recovery to ascertain true therapeutic benefit (fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7). The assay’s reliance on fixed immunostaining also limits real-time or dynamic assessment of node formation, and variability in culture conditions or antibody specificity might affect assay sensitivity. \n\nIn summary, the nodal domain formation assay represents a valuable and mechanistically relevant platform for early-stage drug discovery in CMT. Its ability to quantitatively assess nodal integrity offers a direct functional readout of myelin repair, although its findings must be integrated with complementary functional assays and in vivo validations to fully capture therapeutic efficacy (clark2017cocultureswithstem pages 1-2, fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 6-7).', 'index': '9'}"
