Proposal for Forskolin (adenylate cyclase activator; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # F6886)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Forskolin is a naturally occurring diterpenoid extracted primarily from the roots of Coleus forskohlii and has been historically used in traditional herbal medicine. It belongs to the class of adenylate cyclase activators, a group of compounds well known for their capacity to increase intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Forskolin was originally isolated and characterized for its ability to activate transmembrane adenylate cyclases, making it a valuable biochemical tool for examining cAMP-mediated signaling pathways in various cell types, including neurons and glial cells. This compound is commercially available (for example, from Sigma-Aldrich catalog # F6886) and has been widely employed in in vitro studies to simplify the modulation of cAMP-dependent cascades. Its use as a probe in retinal cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and other tissues underscores its broad impact as an experimental tool. In the context of peripheral nerve biology, forskolin has been leveraged to study Schwann cell physiology and their transition from a proliferative state to a differentiated, myelinating state (Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 29–30; Bacallao & Monje, 2013, pp. 1–2).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, forskolin has been applied in a range of biochemical and preclinical studies rather than as a frontline clinical therapeutic for any specific demyelinating disorder. Biochemically, it has been used as the “gold standard” compound to elevate cAMP in cellular systems, thereby elucidating the role of the cAMP pathway in cell differentiation, gene expression, and cytoskeletal organization. Preclinically, forskolin’s cAMP-elevating capabilities have been exploited in studies using dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cocultures to drive Schwann cell differentiation and to increase markers associated with myelination, such as myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) and neurofascin 155 (NF155) (Bacallao & Monje, 2013, pp. 14–15; Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 13–16). Despite its extensive use in laboratory research and exploratory studies in peripheral nerve repair models (for example, in Trembler-J rat models), there have been no registered clinical trials specifically evaluating forskolin for the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease or related peripheral neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov). This absence of clinical trial data reflects both the historical focus of forskolin as a research tool and the challenges involved in translating in vitro effects into proven clinical outcomes. However, evidence from biochemical and animal model studies—including those examining improvements in conduction velocity and nodal architecture in demyelinating conditions—provides a promising rationale for its repurposing as an adjunct therapy for disorders characterized by Schwann cell dysfunction (Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 25–26).

Mechanism of Action:
Forskolin’s primary mechanism of action is its direct activation of transmembrane adenylate cyclase, leading to an increase in intracellular cAMP. The elevation in cAMP acts as a second messenger that, in turn, activates multiple downstream effectors. Two central pathways are activated by increased cAMP: protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC). PKA phosphorylates a range of intracellular targets, including transcription factors (e.g., CREB) and proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement, which are essential for gene expression modulation, cellular differentiation, and myelin sheath formation. EPAC, on the other hand, acts through Rap1 signaling and contributes to processes that appear to have a more selective role in promoting Schwann cell differentiation and the synthesis of myelin proteins (Bacallao & Monje, 2013, pp. 4–5, 15–16). Preclinical data indicate that forskolin-induced cAMP elevation increases the expression of transcriptional regulators like Krox-20, which plays a critical role in the transition of Schwann cells from an immature to a myelinating state. Additionally, studies in primary Schwann cell cultures and DRG cocultures have shown that forskolin treatment enhances the expression of several myelin-related proteins, including MAG, P0, and NF155, thereby implicating a role in the assembly of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that define nodal and paranodal architecture (Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 22–23; Bacallao & Monje, 2013, pp. 8–10). Importantly, forskolin appears to preferentially activate the PKA branch of cAMP signaling; however, the balance between PKA and EPAC activation is critical, as excessive PKA activity may promote proliferation rather than full differentiation—an insight derived from studies showing that selective cAMP analogs can impact Schwann cells differently (Bacallao & Monje, 2013, pp. 2–4). Thus, forskolin’s molecular action involves an intricate interplay between the cAMP levels generated via tmAC activation and the downstream PKA- and EPAC-mediated pathways, which then drive transcriptional programs leading to cytoskeletal reorganization, myelin gene expression, and the proper assembly and localization of CAMs at nodes and paranodes (Jacobs, 2021, pp. 5–7).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, the expected effect of forskolin in assays designed to evaluate its action on peripheral nerve repair—and specifically on Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease—would be multifaceted. In in vitro DRG-Schwann cell cocultures, forskolin is expected to elevate cAMP levels in Schwann cells, resulting in enhanced expression of myelin proteins such as MAG and NF155, which are critical for the formation and maintenance of paranodal junctions. Increased PKA activity resulting from forskolin treatment is anticipated to promote the phosphorylation and proper membrane localization of NF155, thereby improving the assembly of paranodal domains vital for saltatory conduction (Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 23–25; Malone et al., 2013, pp. 5–7). In parallel, activation of EPAC signaling could facilitate cytoskeletal remodeling, an event that is necessary for the morphological differentiation of Schwann cells and for the formation of mature myelin sheaths. In vivo, topical administration of forskolin in animal models—such as the Trembler-J rat model, which has been used to recapitulate aspects of the demyelinating pathology seen in CMT—has been associated with improvements in nerve conduction velocity and nodal architecture (Park et al., 2018, pp. 14–16). Preclinical studies suggest that by elevating cAMP, forskolin can “prime” Schwann cells for differentiation and enhance the repair of nodal and paranodal structures, thereby restoring efficient nerve conduction and ameliorating motor deficits. These expected outcomes are supported by evidence that cAMP elevation, through pharmacological agents like forskolin or by inhibition of PDE enzymes, leads to upregulation of transcription factors (e.g., Krox-20) and myelin proteins (e.g., P0, MAG), which are central to myelination processes and nodal organization (Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 27–29; Jacobs, 2021, pp. 17–18).

Overall Evaluation:
In our evaluation of forskolin as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, several strengths and weaknesses emerge from the literature.

One major strength lies in forskolin’s well-characterized mechanism of action: its capacity to elevate intracellular cAMP levels through direct activation of adenylate cyclase is robustly documented and has been shown to drive both Schwann cell proliferation and differentiation. The dual activation of PKA and EPAC offers a biologically plausible mechanism by which forskolin can enhance the expression of key transcription factors such as Krox-20, a master regulator of myelin gene expression, and promote the synthesis and proper localization of myelin-associated proteins like MAG and NF155, which are essential for nodal and paranodal repair (Bacallao & Monje, 2013, pp. 1–2; Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 19–22). This is particularly encouraging since dysregulation of these molecular events is central to the pathogenesis of CMT1A, a demyelinating neuropathy. Preclinical studies discussed in the literature indicate that forskolin-treated DRG cocultures exhibit increased expression of myelin genes and enhanced junction assembly, lending further support to its mechanism (Malone et al., 2013, pp. 5–7; Monk et al., 2009, p. 8).

Another positive attribute is the favorable pharmacokinetic profile reported in peripheral nerve studies; forskolin has been shown to penetrate peripheral nerves effectively, and its established safety profile in biochemical and clinical contexts (as evidenced by prior clinical use in non-neurological conditions) alleviates concerns about serious toxicity. This safety aspect is reinforced by the absence of serious adverse effects in experimental models, making forskolin a compelling candidate for repurposing in a clinical setting for CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov).

However, there are important limitations. Although forskolin robustly elevates cAMP and drives certain aspects of Schwann cell differentiation, several studies report that forskolin alone may be insufficient to trigger full myelination. For example, in isolated Schwann cell systems, forskolin-induced cAMP elevation can enhance early differentiation markers, yet without additional signals—such as those provided by axonal contact or co-factors like ascorbate—the cells often fail to produce mature myelin proteins such as myelin basic protein (MBP) (Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 13–16; Bacallao & Monje, 2013, pp. 2–4). This suggests that while forskolin’s molecular mechanism is sound, its therapeutic efficacy might rely on combination therapies or adjunct approaches to fully realize remyelination and nodal/paranodal repair in the complex in vivo environment of peripheral nerves. Furthermore, there is evidence that forskolin preferentially stimulates the PKA pathway, which, in some contexts, may promote proliferation at the expense of differentiation, unless carefully balanced with EPAC activation (Bacallao & Monje, 2013, pp. 15–16). The differential sensitivity of these downstream pathways indicates that the dosing and delivery method of forskolin will need to be finely tuned—a challenge in drug formulation and clinical translation.

Another consideration is the clinical trial landscape. Although extensive preclinical data exists for forskolin in related models of demyelination and peripheral neuropathy, there is a notable absence of registered clinical trials directly evaluating forskolin for CMT or similar demyelinating diseases. This gap in the literature means that while the biochemical rationale is robust, the translation into clinical benefit remains unproven at this stage (ClinicalTrials.gov; Jacobs, 2021, pp. 20–22).

Furthermore, comparative studies using PDE inhibitors (such as PDE4D inhibitors) have shown promising results in elevating cAMP levels and enhancing Schwann cell differentiation, sometimes with more selective targeting than forskolin. These studies provide a benchmark against which forskolin’s performance can be measured, and they underscore the importance of achieving the correct balance between proliferative and differentiative signals (Jacobs, 2021, pp. 1–5; Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 27–29). Such comparisons suggest that while forskolin has mechanistic validity, its potency and specificity relative to emerging PDE inhibitors will be critical determinants of its ultimate utility.

In summary, the overall evaluation is cautiously optimistic. Forskolin’s longstanding use as a research tool, its clearly defined mechanism of enhancing cAMP levels via adenylate cyclase activation, and its downstream effects on PKA and EPAC pathways constitute a strong biochemical foundation for its potential utility in promoting Schwann cell differentiation and remyelination. This mechanism is directly relevant to addressing the pathological features of CMT, particularly by upregulating myelin gene expression and promoting cytoskeletal reorganization that supports proper CAM assembly at nodal and paranodal regions. Nevertheless, the challenges include its possible insufficiency as a monotherapy for complete myelin repair, the need to balance proliferative versus differentiative signaling, and the current lack of clinical trial evidence in CMT populations. As such, while forskolin holds promise as an adjunct therapy and a tool for further investigation in preclinical models of CMT, additional studies—especially those incorporating combinatory approaches with other regulatory signals and longer-term in vivo assessments—will be critical to fully validate its therapeutic potential (Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 25–26; Jacobs, 2021, pp. 22–29; Monk et al., 2009, p. 8; Park et al., 2018, pp. 14–16).

Overall, our evaluation supports further investigation of forskolin in well-controlled preclinical models that mimic the pathophysiological features of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Key experimental approaches should include in vitro DRG-Schwann cell coculture assays to confirm enhanced expression of myelin markers (MAG, NF155, P0) and proper nodal/paranodal junction assembly, as well as in vivo studies in Trembler-J rat models to assess functional improvements in nerve conduction and motor performance. Given forskolin’s established safety profile and predictable pharmacokinetics in peripheral nerve tissues, combined with its robust activation of cAMP-dependent signaling, it represents a promising candidate for repurposing as an adjunct therapy in CMT. However, meticulous formulation and dosing strategies, potentially in combination with other agents like ascorbate or neuregulin analogs, will be essential to overcome the limitations observed in isolated systems. Ultimately, while the biochemical rationale is compelling, bridging the gap between cellular studies and clinical benefit will require rigorous preclinical validation followed by carefully designed clinical trials. This multifaceted evaluation informs our research direction and strongly supports the continuation of detailed studies on forskolin as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 29–30; Jacobs, 2021, pp. 5–7; Brewer et al., 2014, pp. 11–12; Choi et al., 2015, p. 6; Hörner et al., 2022, pp. 34–35).
