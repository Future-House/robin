Proposal for Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor; Tocris catalog # 1254)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Y-27632 is a small-molecule inhibitor that targets Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), an enzyme critically involved in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell contractility, and motility. Chemically, Y-27632 is part of the 4-aminopyridine derivative class, discovered through efforts to elucidate the Rho/ROCK pathway’s role in growth cone collapse and neurite inhibition (Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005; “Rock inhibition for the promotion of spinal cord regeneration,” 2006). Originally synthesized as a tool compound to probe kinase-mediated regulation of cytoskeletal organization, it has since served as a prototype for ROCK inhibition in multiple experimental models. The compound, sold commercially (Tocris catalog #1254), has been employed broadly in both in vitro and in vivo studies to reverse cytoskeletal rigidity in neuronal and non-neuronal cells, making it a representative member of a larger family of ROCK inhibitors that have been developed for vascular, neurological, and fibrotic conditions (Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005; Tönges, Koch, Bähr, & Lingor, 2011).

Therapeutic History:
ROCK inhibitors as a class have been extensively characterized in preclinical models of central nervous system (CNS) injury. Y-27632, in particular, has demonstrated the ability to facilitate neurite outgrowth, axonal regeneration, and functional recovery in spinal cord injury and optic nerve crush models (“Rock inhibition for the promotion of spinal cord regeneration,” 2006; Tönges et al., 2011). Beyond CNS applications, several studies have hinted at positive effects on peripheral nerve regeneration. For example, preclinical evaluations in dorsal root ganglia and co-culture systems with Schwann cells have shown that ROCK inhibition can enhance neurite extension and promote myelination (Lamas, 2015; Kotoda, Ishiyama, Shintani, & Matsukawa, 2015). Clinical safety and pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in other contexts—systemic dosing has yielded peripheral nerve exposure sufficient for therapeutic effects, and in clinical trials for corneal endothelial dysfunction (NCT06041256) and peripheral neuropathy, similar compounds have been well tolerated (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b; Mertsch et al., 2021). Although there are no direct clinical trials of Y-27632 for Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease per se, the considerable literature on ROCK inhibition in analogous demyelinating conditions suggests that its repurposing merits investigation, especially given reports of improved nerve conduction in rodent models mimicking peripheral neuropathy and alterations in paranodal gap widths (Berardo et al., 2024; Rayner, 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Y-27632 acts as a competitive inhibitor at the ATP-binding site of ROCK isoforms (ROCK I and ROCK II), thereby attenuating phosphorylation events central to actomyosin contractility. ROCK-mediated phosphorylation of targets such as the myosin light chain (MLC) and LIM kinase results in increased actin-myosin interactions and cytoskeletal tension; this is a key mechanism by which growth cones collapse, neurite extension is impeded, and cellular contractility is maintained (Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005; Tönges et al., 2011). In Schwann cells, hyperactivity of RhoA/ROCK signaling is hypothesized to prevent the radial extension of lamellipodia, critical for the formation of paranodal septate junctions—a structure essential for proper axon–glial interactions and rapid nerve conduction. By reducing phosphorylation of MLC, Y-27632 permits relaxation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thereby enabling Schwann cells to extend processes more effectively and support the assembly of Caspr1 complexes and other adhesion molecules at paranodal regions (Lamas, 2015; Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005). This mechanistic insight is reinforced by in vitro data showing reduced MLC phosphorylation in Schwann cells upon treatment with Y-27632, as well as enhanced process extension in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) co-culture assays (Fujita & Yamashita, 2014; Mertsch et al., 2021). Furthermore, modulation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway has been implicated in altering intracellular signaling cascades such as those involving PTEN and Akt/mTOR, which further contribute to neuronal and glial survival mechanisms (Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005; Tönges et al., 2011).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed therapeutic context for CMT, Y-27632 is expected to promote paranodal septate junction assembly by alleviating the excessive actomyosin contraction present in Schwann cells. The rationale is that hyperactivation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway in CMT contributes to increased cytoskeletal tension at the Schwann cell paranodal loops. Consequently, this tension interferes with proper membrane apposition and disrupts the assembly of critical junctional complexes, including those involving Caspr1. Administration of Y-27632 should reduce the phosphorylation of MLC, thereby reducing contractility and allowing the radial lamellipodia of Schwann cells to re-establish the normal apposition of membranes required for paranodal junction formation. The in vitro assays—with DRG neurons co-cultured with Schwann cells—have demonstrated that treatment with Y-27632 results in enhanced Schwann cell process extension and increased myelination, which is anticipated to translate into improved nerve conduction velocities and normalized nodal gap widths in vivo (Lamas, 2015; Berardo et al., 2024). The hypothesis is bolstered by preclinical observations in rodent models of peripheral neuropathy, where ROCK inhibition has been correlated with improvements in electrophysiological parameters and ultrastructural normalization of nodes of Ranvier (Rayner, 2019; Kotoda et al., 2015). The expected biochemical changes—in particular, reduced levels of phosphorylated myosin light chain in Schwann cells—serve as a molecular readout confirming target engagement and support the predicted enhancement of paranodal septate junction assembly.

Overall Evaluation:
Y-27632 possesses considerable potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease based on its well-established role in modulating RhoA/ROCK signaling and its documented effects on cytoskeletal reorganization. One major strength of this candidate is its robust preclinical safety profile, with extensive studies demonstrating peripheral nerve exposure after systemic dosing and established tolerability in various animal models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b; Mertsch et al., 2021). Its mechanism of action is thoroughly characterized; by competitively inhibiting ROCK, Y-27632 decreases phosphorylation of key substrates that regulate actin-myosin activity, thereby reducing Schwann cell contractility and permitting the appropriate membrane dynamics necessary for paranodal junction assembly (Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005; Tönges et al., 2011). Preclinical studies where ROCK inhibitors are employed to improve myelination and nerve conduction in rodent models provide a promising translational bridge to CMT, a disorder characterized by demyelination and abnormal paranodal structure (Lamas, 2015; Berardo et al., 2024).

However, there are also some weaknesses and potential challenges. The therapeutic window for ROCK inhibitors such as Y-27632 may be narrow, as higher concentrations have been associated with off-target effects and possible inhibitory effects on neurite outgrowth due to excessive reductions in cytoskeletal tension (Tönges et al., 2011; Roloff et al., 2015). Moreover, while there is abundant evidence supporting the utility of Y-27632 in CNS injury models, direct clinical evidence in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease remains limited, necessitating further targeted preclinical studies to validate its efficacy specifically for improving paranodal assembly in Schwann cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a; Rayner, 2019). Additionally, although systemic dosing yields adequate peripheral nerve exposure, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters must be optimized to ensure that the compound reaches effective concentrations at the target sites without eliciting systemic toxicity (Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005; Kotoda et al., 2015). Another potential concern is the inherent complexity of cytoskeletal regulation in Schwann cells; other compensatory pathways may modulate actin dynamics, and it is not yet clear whether ROCK inhibition alone will fully restore paranodal integrity in the context of a hereditary demyelinating disease such as CMT (Tönges et al., 2011; Lamas, 2015).

Overall, the strengths of Y-27632 lie in its well-understood mechanism of action, supportive preclinical data on cytoskeletal regulation and peripheral nerve regeneration, and established safety profile in non-CNS applications. Its ability to decrease actomyosin contractility and thereby facilitate Schwann cell process extension and paranodal complex formation makes it a highly promising candidate for repurposing in CMT. Nonetheless, further focused studies are required to establish its direct effects on paranodal septate junction assembly in CMT rodent models, to optimize dosing regimens, and to assess long-term efficacy and safety in the specific setting of demyelinating peripheral neuropathies (Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005; Rayner, 2019). In conclusion, while challenges remain, the cumulative biochemical, preclinical, and safety data support further exploration of Y-27632 as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, with its translational potential making it a compelling lead for future drug development efforts in this domain (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a; Kotoda et al., 2015; Tönges et al., 2011).
