Proposal for Zonisamide (anticonvulsant; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # Z4777)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Zonisamide is a synthetic benzisoxazole derivative originally developed in Japan as an anticonvulsant drug and later repurposed for Parkinson’s disease, reflecting its multifunctional pharmacological profile (Baulac, 2006). It belongs to the class of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that primarily function by modulating ion channel activity—specifically by blocking voltage‐dependent sodium channels and inhibiting T‐type calcium channels—which underlies its anticonvulsant efficacy (Holder & Wilfong, 2011). The compound is commercially available (for example, Sigma-Aldrich catalog # Z4777) and has been extensively characterized regarding its absorption, metabolism, and long half‐life that supports once-daily dosing (Baulac, 2006; Holder & Wilfong, 2011). As a member of the AED class with additional neuroprotective attributes, zonisamide has been the subject of various biochemical and preclinical studies that have explored its benefits in models of epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and neuropathic pain (Na & Lee, 2025; Yagi et al., 2015). The appealing aspect of repurposing zonisamide lies in its established clinical safety profile and its favorable central and peripheral nervous system distribution, both of which encourage exploration of its potential to mitigate complex disorders like Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, zonisamide has been used to treat epilepsy, particularly as adjunctive therapy in refractory partial seizures and as a treatment option in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and other seizure disorders, due to its broad-spectrum anticonvulsant activity (Baulac, 2006; Holder & Wilfong, 2011). In addition, its repositioning for Parkinson’s disease has taken advantage of its ability to modulate dopaminergic neurotransmission, reduce oxidative stress, and exert neuroprotective effects, which have been beneficial in reducing motor fluctuations and improving overall clinical outcomes in PD patients (Murata, 2004). Beyond its conventional neurological applications, several preclinical studies have also demonstrated zonisamide’s capacity to enhance neurite outgrowth as well as improve functional recovery in peripheral nerve injury models (Takaku & Sango, 2020; Yagi et al., 2015). Notably, the clinical trial database search for zonisamide regarding Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and related peripheral nerve disorders has turned up no registered clinical studies, indicating that direct evidence in the context of CMT is currently lacking and that further preclinical exploration is warranted (ClinicalTrials.gov). Although the direct use of zonisamide in CMT has not been previously evaluated either in clinical or dedicated preclinical studies, its efficacy in other neuropathic models and neurodegenerative diseases suggests that it may hold translational promise for disorders characterized by Schwann cell mitochondrial deficits and disrupted axonal support (Na & Lee, 2025; Atli & Dogra, 2005).

Mechanism of Action:
The well-established mechanism of zonisamide as an anticonvulsant primarily involves the blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels and the inhibition of T-type calcium channels, which collectively act to reduce high-frequency neuronal firing and limit excitotoxicity (Holder & Wilfong, 2011; Baulac, 2006). In vitro studies using dorsal root ganglion neurons and hybrid neuronal cell lines demonstrate that zonisamide enhances neurite outgrowth by activating the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways, as evidenced by the increased phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2; these studies underscore its role in promoting neurotrophic support and neuronal regeneration (Takaku & Sango, 2020). Although zonisamide does not directly stimulate proliferation or migration of Schwann cells—as shown by a lack of effect in scratch wound assays using Schwann cell lines (Takaku & Sango, 2020)—its neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects on neurons may indirectly benefit the overall milieu required for myelin repair and paranodal junction maintenance. A key component of the current hypothesis is that zonisamide upregulates mitochondrial biogenesis in Schwann cells via the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) and its downstream partner NRF1 (nuclear respiratory factor 1), thereby improving the energetic capacity of Schwann cells to properly traffic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) such as neurofascin 155 (NF155) essential for paranodal septate junction formation (Viader, 2011). Although the directly measured molecular effects of zonisamide on PGC-1α and NRF1 in Schwann cells have not been conclusively reported in the studies reviewed, there is supporting background literature that indicates therapies enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis can restore Schwann cell function and improve axonal support in peripheral neuropathies (Viader et al., 2011). Moreover, the general consensus from studies exploring zonisamide’s neuroprotective effects indicates that it has favorable mitochondrial safety profiles and may exert indirect mitochondrial protective effects through its antioxidative properties, as seen in models of mitochondrial diseases and neurodegeneration (Finsterer, 2017; Van Hameren, 2018). Taken together, these molecular findings imply that zonisamide’s ability to promote mitochondrial health might extend to Schwann cells, thereby addressing the energy deficits that compromise the trafficking of CAMs and the structural integrity of paranodal junctions in CMT (Viader, 2011; Van Hameren, 2018).

Expected Effect:
The proposed therapeutic mechanism in CMT is that by upregulating PGC-1α and NRF1, zonisamide will enhance mitochondrial biogenesis in Schwann cells, resulting in an increased mitochondrial mass and improved ATP production within these high-energy-demand glial cells. This enhanced energy state is hypothesized to support the energy-dependent trafficking and membrane localization of crucial cell adhesion molecules such as NF155, which in turn will promote paranodal septate junction formation and stabilize the nodal architecture critical for effective nerve conduction (Viader, 2011). In vitro, it is expected that zonisamide-treated Schwann cells will exhibit increased mitochondrial network complexity when assessed by Mitotracker imaging, as well as enhanced membrane localization of NF155 and possibly other paranodal proteins (Takaku & Sango, 2020; Yagi et al., 2015). In rodent models of peripheral neuropathy—particularly those mimicking aspects of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease—the administration of zonisamide is anticipated to improve nerve conduction velocities and reduce pathological features such as paranodal loop detachment and demyelination as evidenced by electrophysiological measurements and ultrastructural analyses using electron microscopy (Yagi et al., 2015; Viader, 2011). Although previous studies have primarily documented zonisamide’s effect on neurite outgrowth in dorsal root ganglion neurons and motor neurons, the extension of these effects to Schwann cell-specific mitochondrial biogenesis represents an innovative therapeutic hypothesis that addresses a key pathological mechanism in CMT—namely, the mitochondrial deficits that impair energy-dependent cellular processes in Schwann cells (Takaku & Sango, 2020; Viader, 2011). In summary, if zonisamide can indeed augment the mitochondrial capacity in Schwann cells, the restored energy state would be expected to enable proper CAM assembly and paranodal junction formation, thereby improving functional nerve conduction and ameliorating clinical signs in CMT models (Viader, 2011; Yagi et al., 2015).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of zonisamide as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease is cautiously optimistic but requires further rigorous preclinical validation. One significant strength of zonisamide is its established clinical safety profile across multiple neurological indications including epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease, which suggests that repurposing this drug for CMT could potentially proceed more rapidly through regulatory pathways (Baulac, 2006; Holder & Wilfong, 2011). Its documented neuroprotective effects, including enhancement of neurite outgrowth through PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling activation, as well as its capacity to dampen microglial-induced neuroinflammation, underscore its multifaceted actions that could be beneficial in a degenerative peripheral nerve disease context (Takaku & Sango, 2020; Yagi et al., 2015). Furthermore, emerging evidence from studies of Schwann cell mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral neuropathies points to the potential therapeutic value of agents that enhance mitochondrial biogenesis via pathways involving PGC-1α and NRF1 (Viader, 2011). The hypothesis that zonisamide could restore energy-dependent CAM trafficking in Schwann cells thereby stabilizing paranodal junctions is innovative and addresses a critical pathogenic mechanism in CMT related to mitochondrial deficits.

However, a key weakness is that direct evidence linking zonisamide to upregulation of PGC-1α/NRF1 and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis specifically in Schwann cells has not yet been demonstrated in the available literature. Most of the current studies focus on the neuronal effects of zonisamide—particularly its capacity to enhance neurite outgrowth and reduce neuronal oxidative stress—while reports on Schwann cell-specific outcomes are limited or show that zonisamide does not significantly influence Schwann cell proliferation or migration (Takaku & Sango, 2020; Yagi et al., 2015). Moreover, the absence of clinical trials or dedicated preclinical studies assessing zonisamide in models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease means that the translational potential for CMT remains speculative at this stage (Na & Lee, 2025; Viader, 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov). In addition, while the antioxidative and ion channel modulating properties of zonisamide could feasibly confer mitochondrial benefits, the molecular linkage to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis mediated by PGC-1α and NRF1 must be established through targeted experiments such as gene expression studies, Mitotracker imaging of mitochondrial networks in Schwann cells, and ultrastructural analyses post-drug treatment. Such studies would also need to examine whether the improved energy supply translates into enhanced assembly of paranodal junctions and improved electrophysiological function in animal models of CMT (Viader et al., 2011; Yagi et al., 2015).

In conclusion, zonisamide presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease due to its known neuroprotective effects, favorable pharmacokinetics, and potential to modulate mitochondrial function. The proposed hypothesis—that by upregulating mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1α and NRF1 in Schwann cells, zonisamide may promote paranodal septate junction formation and improve nerve conduction—is mechanistically plausible and addresses a key energy deficit observed in CMT. However, the current literature offers insufficient direct evidence in Schwann cells to fully validate this mechanism. Therefore, further preclinical studies are essential to investigate zonisamide’s effects on Schwann cell mitochondrial biogenesis, CAM trafficking (including NF155 localization), and paranodal junction integrity in both in vitro and in vivo models of CMT. Only with such data can the translational potential for treating CMT with zonisamide be confidently determined. Strengths of this therapeutic candidate include its established safety profile, multifaceted neuroprotective actions, and the innovative energy-centric approach to treating CMT; weaknesses include the current lack of direct evidence of its action in Schwann cells and uncertainty regarding the magnitude and relevance of its effects on mitochondrial biogenesis in the peripheral nerve context (Na & Lee, 2025; Viader, 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov).
