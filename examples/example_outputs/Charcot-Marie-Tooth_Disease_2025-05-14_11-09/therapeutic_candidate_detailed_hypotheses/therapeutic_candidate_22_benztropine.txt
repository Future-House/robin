Proposal for Benztropine (mAChR antagonist; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # B1253)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Benztropine is a synthetic small molecule originally developed and clinically approved for use as an antiparkinsonian agent, leveraging its role as a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist. It is commercially available, for example, from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog # B1253), and belongs to the pharmacological class of anticholinergic agents. Historically, benztropine was discovered through efforts to counteract cholinergic overactivity and reduce extrapyramidal symptoms in Parkinson’s disease. Its chemical structure was optimized for optimal receptor binding to mAChRs, particularly targeting the M1, M3, and M5 subtypes. As a member of the anticholinergic therapeutic class, benztropine has been widely investigated for its potential effects beyond its original neurological indications, including modulation of neuronal excitability and remyelination. Recent repurposing initiatives have begun to explore its potential to promote myelination by antagonizing inhibitory muscarinic signaling in glial cells, leading to the hypothesis that similar mechanisms may be harnessed in peripheral Schwann cells (Cerles et al., 2019; Deshmukh et al., 2013).

Therapeutic History:
Benztropine has a long clinical history for treating Parkinsonism, where its antimuscarinic and antihistaminergic actions help alleviate motor symptoms by modulating central cholinergic tone. Preclinical studies have also examined benztropine’s effects on oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and myelination in central nervous system (CNS) models of demyelination, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and cuprizone-induced demyelination. In these models, benztropine has been shown to enhance remyelination by promoting the differentiation of OPCs into mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes, leading to improved conduction properties and neurological recovery. Moreover, in the context of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), studies using oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy models in mice have demonstrated that benztropine can exert neuroprotective effects by preserving nerve conduction velocity and maintaining myelin integrity. Although there are few direct clinical trials using benztropine for demyelinating diseases or specifically for Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease, the candidate therapy’s observed ability to improve nerve conduction and modulate cellular pathways involved in myelination in peripheral models suggests translational promise. There is also emerging evidence using dorsal root ganglia (DRG) coculture systems that benztropine can upregulate key paranodal proteins such as neurofascin-155 (NF155) and contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) that are critical for node of Ranvier integrity. The cumulative preclinical evidence from CNS demyelination studies, CIPN models, and preliminary DRG coculture findings has provided the rationale for extending benztropine’s evaluation to peripheral demyelinating disorders like CMT (Castelnovo & Sforza, 2017; Cerles et al., 2019; Deshmukh et al., 2013).

Mechanism of Action:
At a molecular level, benztropine acts primarily by antagonizing muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). In the central nervous system, it has been documented to target M1 and M3 receptor subtypes on OPCs, effectively blocking the negative regulatory influence of muscarinic signaling on cell differentiation. In vitro experiments have shown that benztropine inhibits carbachol-induced calcium influx in OPCs, thereby reducing activation of pathways that normally prevent differentiation. Specifically, blockade of muscarinic receptors has been associated with reduced activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and a concurrent decrease in Notch1 signaling, both of which are known to restrain oligodendrocyte maturation. This mechanism results in increased expression of myelin-associated proteins such as myelin basic protein (MBP), and an elevation of mature oligodendrocyte markers. Biochemical studies indicate that other muscarinic antagonists induce similar OPC differentiation, reinforcing benztropine’s specific action via mAChR blockade. The hypothesis driving its repurposing for CMT builds on the analogy between oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), wherein muscarinic receptors are also expressed. In Schwann cells, M1 receptor signaling has been implicated in maintaining elevated levels of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP); when antagonized by benztropine, the resulting increase in cAMP levels can lead to enhanced phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB) and upregulation of structural proteins critical for paranodal architecture. This cascade is thought to promote the re-establishment of septate-like junctions through increased expression of proteins such as NF155 and Caspr1, which in turn normalize nodal gap spacing and improve nerve conduction. Furthermore, preclinical data from DRG coculture assays have shown that benztropine treatment leads to a measurable increase in p-CREB and upregulation of key paranodal markers, indicating that the molecular mechanisms governing central remyelination might be extrapolated to peripheral nerve repair (Cerles et al., 2019; Deshmukh et al., 2013; Garcia, 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed experimental assays, particularly using CMT-specific dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cocultures and in vivo Trembler-J mouse models, benztropine is expected to produce several beneficial outcomes on the peripheral nerve architecture. The primary expected effect is the restoration of paranodal integrity. By blocking M1 receptors on Schwann cells, benztropine is hypothesized to increase intracellular cAMP levels in these cells. Elevated cAMP, in turn, activates pathways leading to increased phosphorylation of CREB (p-CREB), a transcription factor known to promote the expression of genes involved in myelin maintenance and repair. The upregulation of septate junction proteins, particularly neurofascin-155 (NF155) and contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1), is expected to result in normalized nodal gap spacing and improved paranodal loop organization. This molecular effect should be observable in vitro via immunofluorescence assays in DRG cocultures, where increased staining for NF155 and Caspr1, along with improved organization of the paranodal domain, would signify efficacy in restoring normal nerve architecture. Additionally, in vivo, treatment with benztropine in Trembler-J mice—a well-established murine model of CMT characterized by defects in myelin protein expression and disrupted paranodal structures—is expected to improve nerve conduction velocity and reduce pathological features such as paranodal loop detachment as seen on electron microscopy. Improvements in functional outcomes would be measured by electrophysiological assessments, including improved compound nerve action potential amplitudes, decreased latency, and restored saltatory conduction. The overall effect, therefore, is anticipated to be a normalization of Schwann cell function and a reparation of the nodal/paranodal complexes, ultimately resulting in not only structural but also functional restoration in CMT (Castelnovo & Sforza, 2017; Cerles et al., 2019; Deshmukh et al., 2013).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on the comprehensive literature review, benztropine emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Charcot–Marie–Tooth Disease. One significant strength is its well-documented history and known clinical safety profile in the context of neurological disorders; decades of use in Parkinson’s disease support the drug’s tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties, which facilitate rapid translation into new therapeutic contexts. Preclinical evidence from CNS models has robustly demonstrated that benztropine promotes remyelination via mAChR antagonism, and similar molecular pathways appear to be active in Schwann cells—the primary myelinating cells of the peripheral nervous system. The proposed mechanism, which involves M1 receptor blockade leading to increased cAMP, activation of p-CREB, and subsequent upregulation of paranodal junction proteins NF155 and Caspr1, provides a compelling hypothesis for restoring paranodal architecture in CMT. Early data from DRG coculture studies further substantiate this mechanistic rationale, showing increased expression of these key proteins and improvements in nodal gap spacing upon benztropine treatment. In vivo efficacy is suggested by studies in peripheral neuropathy models such as those induced by chemotherapy, where benztropine has been shown to improve nerve conduction and reduce demyelination; although these models are not identical to CMT, the underlying principles of myelin repair and paranodal stabilization are shared.

Nevertheless, several weaknesses and gaps must be acknowledged. While benztropine’s effects on OPC differentiation and CNS remyelination have been well characterized (Cerles et al., 2019; Deshmukh et al., 2013), direct evidence for its efficacy in peripheral myelination, particularly within Schwann cells and in CMT-specific models, remains limited. Current data from DRG coculture experiments and Trembler-J mice are promising but preliminary; more extensive studies are required to confirm that the mechanisms observed in central nervous system models faithfully recapitulate in the peripheral context. Additionally, although the drug’s pharmacokinetic profile and safety in peripheral use are reportedly acceptable, further targeted clinical trials will be necessary to evaluate its effectiveness in CMT patients, a particularly heterogeneous population with variable genetic and phenotypic presentations. There is also the concern that off-target effects, due to its non-selective muscarinic antagonism, could affect other physiological processes, including cognitive function or cardiovascular parameters, which have to be closely monitored in future clinical studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In summary, the repurposing of benztropine for CMT offers a novel and mechanistically justified therapeutic approach. Its established safety profile, combined with preclinical evidence of remyelination via muscarinic receptor antagonism, positions it as a viable candidate for further development. The central hypothesis that benztropine can restore paranodal architecture—by increasing cAMP levels, enhancing p-CREB signaling, and upregulating NF155 and Caspr1 in Schwann cells—is supported by analogous findings in CNS models and preliminary DRG coculture data. However, caution is warranted as the available literature does not yet provide comprehensive in vivo or clinical data directly addressing its use in CMT. Additional studies, including detailed biochemical assays, expanded animal model testing, and ultimately, carefully designed human clinical trials, will be critical to confirm benztropine’s efficacy and safety in this specific indication. Overall, benztropine represents a promising repurposed drug candidate with a strong mechanistic rationale for improving paranodal integrity and nerve function in Charcot–Marie–Tooth Disease, warranting further investigation by our drug development team (Castelnovo & Sforza, 2017; Cerles et al., 2019; Deshmukh et al., 2013; Garcia, 2020).
