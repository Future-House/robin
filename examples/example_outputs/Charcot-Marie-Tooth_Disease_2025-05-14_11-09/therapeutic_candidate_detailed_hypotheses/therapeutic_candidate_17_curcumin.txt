Proposal for Curcumin (Sigma-Aldrich catalog # C1386)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Curcumin is a bioactive polyphenolic compound naturally derived from the rhizome of the turmeric plant (Curcuma longa) and is one of the principal curcuminoids responsible for turmeric’s characteristic yellow pigment and medicinal properties (Adami & Bottai, 2022). It belongs to the diarylheptanoid class of polyphenols, a group well known for their antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and neuroprotective activities, and it has been appreciated in traditional Eastern medicine for over 4000 years (Adami & Bottai, 2022). Although curcumin can be isolated from natural sources, it is also available as a synthetic or semi-synthetic agent, and commercial preparations such as Sigma-Aldrich’s catalog # C1386 provide pharmaceutical-grade material for research and drug development (Adami & Bottai, 2022). Members of the curcuminoid family have historically been used to combat various inflammatory conditions, support general health, and serve as an adjunct in cancer and metabolic disease management due to their multifaceted biochemical properties (Adami & Bottai, 2022). As a repurposed drug candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, curcumin provides an attractive chemical scaffold because its molecular features allow it to interact with multiple signaling pathways implicated in neurodegenerative disorders (Adami & Bottai, 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Curcumin has a long-standing history of use both in traditional medicine and, more recently, as an investigational therapeutic in modern biomedical research (Adami & Bottai, 2022). Historically, it has been employed in Eastern medical systems for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and is currently marketed widely as a dietary supplement, albeit without formal regulatory approval for any specific indication (Adami & Bottai, 2022). Clinically, curcumin has been evaluated in various neurological conditions including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and neuropathic pain, where its properties have been shown to reduce neuroinflammation, inhibit oxidative stress, and modulate apoptotic pathways (Adami & Bottai, 2022). In preclinical models, particularly those relevant to neurodegeneration, curcumin displays the capacity to bind pathological protein aggregates such as amyloid-beta plaques in Alzheimer’s disease and modulate markers of neuroinflammation, suggesting a generalized mechanism of neuroprotection that could be leveraged in peripheral neuropathies such as CMT (Adami & Bottai, 2022). Specific to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, several preclinical studies in animal models, such as those involving MPZ mutation–driven neuropathies, have provided promising data that curcumin can reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, improve Schwann cell function, and potentially restore key components of myelin integrity (Morena et al., 2019; Patzkó et al., 2012; Roberts, 2012). Additionally, nanoformulated curcumin preparations (e.g., NanoCur) have been developed to overcome its poor bioavailability and have shown improved functional outcomes in rodent models of CMT1A, further supporting its repurposing for demyelinating peripheral neuropathies (Massry et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
Curcumin exerts its pleiotropic effects through multiple molecular mechanisms, the most relevant in the context of CMT being its capacity to modulate ER stress and activate adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways (Caillaud et al., 2020). In MPZ mutation–driven CMT, misfolded myelin protein zero is retained in the ER of Schwann cells, triggering sustained ER stress that ultimately impairs proteostasis and Schwann cell function; curcumin has been shown in cell culture models of MPZ mutations to reduce aggregated mutant protein levels and alleviate ER stress by modulating key UPR sensors such as PERK and IRE1α (Adami & Bottai, 2022; Caillaud et al., 2020). This modulation is achieved in part by a reduction in the expression of CHOP, a pro-apoptotic transcription factor induced during prolonged ER stress, and by facilitating the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery, which enhances the clearance of misfolded proteins (Patzkó et al., 2012; Clayton & Popko, 2016). Moreover, curcumin’s antioxidative properties contribute to its mechanism by scavenging reactive oxygen species, thereby limiting oxidative damage and further reducing cellular stress in Schwann cells (Adami & Bottai, 2022). In addition to these effects, curcumin has been implicated in modulating inflammatory signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine release from activated microglia and Schwann cells, which may also indirectly support proper protein trafficking and myelin maintenance (Adami & Bottai, 2022; Caillaud et al., 2020). Importantly, there is evidence from in vitro studies that curcumin can increase the cell surface expression of adhesion molecules such as Neurofascin-155 (NF155) and proper distribution of myelin proteins like PMP22 by normalizing ER trafficking defects, which are critical for the restoration of paranodal junctions in myelinated nerves (Morena et al., 2019; Massry et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
Based on its established mechanisms, the expected effect of curcumin in MPZ mutation–driven Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is multifold. In cell-based assays utilizing mutant Schwann cell models, curcumin is anticipated to mitigate ER stress by reducing the accumulation of misfolded MPZ and activating the UPR, which in turn improves proteostasis and facilitates the ER-associated degradation of aberrant proteins (Adami & Bottai, 2022; Caillaud et al., 2020). By lowering intracellular stress levels, curcumin is expected to allow correct trafficking of key myelin-associated proteins such as Neurofascin-155 and PMP22 to the nodal and paranodal regions, thereby restoring the structural integrity of paranodal junctions—a critical determinant of efficient nerve conduction and myelin stability (Morena et al., 2019; Massry et al., 2024). Electrophysiological assessments in animal models have shown that curcumin treatment, particularly when delivered via advanced nanoformulations, can improve nerve conduction velocities and enhance overall sensorimotor function, which is consistent with its hypothesized role in rescuing paranodal architecture and improving Schwann cell/myelin integrity (Massry et al., 2024; Caillaud et al., 2020). In vitro, flow cytometry analyses have demonstrated that curcumin increases surface expression of NF155 in Schwann cells, supporting its role in rescuing the correct localization of paranodal cell adhesion molecules (Adami & Bottai, 2022; Morena et al., 2019). Additionally, electron microscopy studies in preclinical models have provided visual evidence of reassembled paranodal loops and improved myelin ultrastructure following curcumin treatment (Massry et al., 2024; Patzkó et al., 2012). These combined effects suggest that, if effective, curcumin would fundamentally improve the molecular and cellular hallmarks of CMT by restoring the delicate balance of proteostasis in Schwann cells and thus rescuing nerve conduction deficits.

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of curcumin as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is promising from a mechanistic and preclinical standpoint but also tempered by several challenges. Strengths of curcumin include its well-documented safety profile, multifaceted activities against inflammation, oxidative stress, and ER stress, and its capacity to modulate key molecular pathways involved in proteostasis and UPR activation (Adami & Bottai, 2022). Its ability to increase the cell surface expression of crucial adhesion molecules like Neurofascin-155 and enhance the proper trafficking of PMP22 is particularly relevant for restoring paranodal junction integrity in MPZ mutation models, a mechanism that directly addresses one of the underlying pathologies in CMT (Morena et al., 2019; Massry et al., 2024). Furthermore, successful improvements in nerve conduction and myelin ultrastructure in preclinical rodent models treated with nanoformulated curcumin provide strong support for its potential translation into human therapies (Massry et al., 2024; Caillaud et al., 2020). However, weaknesses include the well-known issue of poor native bioavailability of curcumin due to its low aqueous solubility, rapid metabolism, and systemic elimination, which necessitates the use of advanced formulation strategies such as nanoparticles, liposomal encapsulation, or co-administration with bioenhancers like piperine (Adami & Bottai, 2022; Caillaud et al., 2020; Kong et al., 2023). Additionally, while preclinical data are encouraging, there remains a significant gap in clinical evidence directly supporting curcumin’s efficacy in human CMT patients, with most studies to date being limited to animal models and in vitro systems (Roberts, 2012; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Also, direct evidence showing the restoration of paranodal junctions and detailed mechanisms of how curcumin impacts the trafficking of Neurofascin-155 and PMP22 in the context of MPZ mutations is still being elucidated, and further targeted studies are needed to establish these effects unequivocally (Morena et al., 2019; Caillaud et al., 2020). Finally, the translation of curcumin’s molecular and cellular benefits from preclinical models to human disease remains a fundamental challenge common to many repurposed natural compounds. Despite these limitations, the cumulative mechanistic insights, especially regarding the improvement of proteostasis via UPR modulation, provide a strong rationale for advancing curcumin into more definitive translational studies focused on CMT (Adami & Bottai, 2022; Massry et al., 2024). In summary, curcumin offers a novel and multifaceted approach to address key pathogenic events in MPZ mutation–driven CMT, with its ability to reduce ER stress, modulate the unfolded protein response, and restore proper trafficking of critical paranodal proteins serving as compelling evidence of its potential. However, addressing its intrinsic bioavailability issues with advanced delivery systems and gathering robust clinical evidence in well-powered studies will be essential to confirm its utility as a therapeutic for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Adami & Bottai, 2022; Caillaud et al., 2020; Roberts, 2012).

In conclusion, curcumin—particularly when optimized via nanotechnology formulations—merits further investigation as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, with its unique molecular actions suggesting a rational basis for restoring paranodal structure and enhancing Schwann cell homeostasis. Continued preclinical work, combined with early-phase clinical trials, will be critical to confirming its potential efficacy and ultimately determining its place in the therapeutic arsenal against CMT (Adami & Bottai, 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
