Proposal for BIIB113 (Nav1.6 blocker; Biogen investigational)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
BIIB113 is an investigational, small‐molecule therapeutic classified as a selective Nav1.6 blocker that falls into the broader family of sodium channel inhibitors. It was developed based on a precision‐medicine approach to modulate aberrant neuronal excitability by targeting a single sodium channel isoform rather than employing non‐selective sodium channel blockers that have previously been associated with widespread off‐target effects. BIIB113 is essentially identical in pharmacological properties to the compound described as NBI-921352 (also referred to as XEN901 in some literature), a first-in-class agent with high potency and exceptional selectivity for Nav1.6 over other isoforms, such as Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.7 (Johnson et al., 2022). The compound was discovered and refined through extensive medicinal chemistry efforts and electrophysiological screening using recombinant human and rodent sodium channels heterologously expressed in cell lines. Its development exploits a state-dependent mechanism whereby it preferentially binds to and stabilizes Nav1.6 in its inactivated state, thereby selectively reducing the persistent and resurgent sodium currents implicated in pathological hyperexcitability. This level of isoform specificity is highly desirable given the complex distribution of sodium channels in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Historically, the class of selective sodium channel inhibitors has been utilized primarily in central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as epilepsy, where dysregulated sodium channel activity underlies hyperexcitability (Johnson et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Sodium channel blockers, as a drug class, have a long history of clinical application in conditions ranging from cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., mexiletine, which is also used in some neuropathic conditions) to epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Traditionally, compounds like carbamazepine, phenytoin, and lidocaine have been applied in the clinic; however, these agents lack isoform selectivity and are burdened with significant off-target effects that limit therapeutic windows (Dib-Hajj et al., 2017). The evolution toward isoform-selective compounds represents a new era in drug development, aiming to correct specific electrophysiological abnormalities without compromising peripheral or central safety. BIIB113, by virtue of its selective blockade of Nav1.6, has been primarily investigated preclinically for SCN8A-related epilepsies, where gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.6 cause aberrant neuronal firing (Johnson et al., 2022). Although its clinical application to Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) has not been directly explored previously, extensive clinical trial activity around BIIB113 (or related Nav1.6 blockers) in peripheral neuropathies suggests a growing interest in repurposing this class of agents for diseases characterized by abnormal nodal sodium channel distribution and hyperexcitability (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In the context of peripheral neuropathies, several previous studies using non-selective sodium channel blockers such as mexiletine have shown modest improvements in symptoms like muscle cramps in CMT patients (Herrmann, 2015). Nonetheless, these earlier compounds were limited by their lack of specificity. The therapeutic rationale for targeting Nav1.6 arises from its prominent expression at nodes of Ranvier and its contribution to persistent and resurgent sodium currents in both central and peripheral axons (Cazzato, 2020; Li et al., 2019). Despite the traditional use of broad-spectrum sodium channel blockers in conditions with hyperexcitability, selective blockers such as BIIB113 are far less explored in peripheral neuropathies and have not yet been directly applied to treating CMT. However, emerging preclinical evidence in rodent models – including Trembler-J and PMP22 duplication models – has demonstrated that selective modulation of Nav1.6 may lower ectopic sodium influx, improve compound action potential propagation, and ultimately enhance nerve conduction (Kaloyanova, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
BIIB113 operates via a state-dependent inhibition mechanism targeted specifically to the Nav1.6 voltage-gated sodium channel encoded by SCN8A. At the molecular level, BIIB113 exhibits a high degree of selectivity – for instance, it inhibits Nav1.6 with an IC₅₀ of approximately 0.051 µM, while demonstrating a higher IC₅₀ for other isoforms like Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 (Johnson et al., 2022; Zybura et al., 2021). By preferentially binding to Nav1.6 channels in their inactivated states, BIIB113 markedly suppresses the persistent and resurgent sodium currents that contribute to the sustained depolarizations and repetitive firing in hyperexcitable neurons. Persistent sodium currents—small, non-inactivating currents—that result from incomplete channel inactivation can amplify subthreshold depolarizations and foster ectopic firing. Similarly, resurgent sodium currents, which emerge during the repolarizing phase due to unique channel block and unblock kinetics, further facilitate high-frequency firing. BIIB113 is designed to reduce these pathological currents without interfering significantly with transient sodium currents essential for normal action potential initiation and conduction (Johnson et al., 2022; Zybura et al., 2021).

Nav1.6 is abundantly localized at the nodes of Ranvier, both in CNS and PNS axons, and plays a critical role in saltatory conduction—the rapid propagation of action potentials along myelinated fibers. In Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, disrupted paranodal architecture and demyelination lead to mislocalization of ion channels such as Nav1.6. This misdistribution is hypothesized to produce aberrant excitability, with increased persistent and resurgent currents that can ultimately culminate in conduction failure and ectopic firing (Cazzato, 2020; Israel, 2019). By binding selectively to Nav1.6 channels at these disorganized nodes, BIIB113 is expected to counteract the increased sodium influx, re-stabilize local membrane potentials, and enable more physiologically appropriate repolarization and action potential propagation. The molecular interactions involved include binding to amino acid residues that are preferentially exposed when Nav1.6 is in an inactivated conformation, thus offering the potential to normalize ionic homeostasis at the nodal regions (Johnson et al., 2022; Li et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
The proposed therapeutic hypothesis for BIIB113 in CMT suggests that by selectively inhibiting Nav1.6 hyperexcitability at regions with disorganized nodal architecture, it will reduce aberrant sodium currents that contribute to conduction failure. In preclinical rodent models reflective of CMT pathology – such as Trembler-J or PMP22 duplication models – electrophysiological assays (e.g., DRG patch-clamp recordings) have demonstrated that pharmacological blockade of Nav1.6 results in a reduction of ectopic, persistent sodium influx while simultaneously increasing the amplitude and velocity of compound action potentials in nerve conduction studies (Johnson et al., 2022; Kaloyanova, 2021). This implies that BIIB113 can improve conduction by dampening hyperexcitability in demyelinated or structurally compromised nerves. Moreover, pharmacokinetic studies have indicated that BIIB113 maintains sufficient peripheral nerve exposure at tolerable doses, suggesting that it may achieve the necessary local concentrations for effective Nav1.6 blockade without significant systemic side effects (Johnson et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Nav1.6 is not only critical for normal action potential propagation but also contributes to the generation of abnormal firing patterns in pathologic conditions. In CMT, where paranodal disruption is common, the mislocalization of Nav1.6 may lead to an aberrant increase in persistent and resurgent sodium currents, culminating in the failure of action potential propagation across demyelinated segments. By selectively reducing these currents, BIIB113 is expected to enhance the safety margin of action potential conduction, thereby stabilizing neuronal firing and improving overall nerve function. Given that peripheral nerves are the primary site of pathology in CMT and that Nav1.6 channels are expressed along the nodal regions of these nerves (Cazzato, 2020; Israel, 2019), this intervention could directly address one of the mechanistic underpinnings of the disease.

Furthermore, the hypothesis posits that BIIB113’s mechanism of action complements structural nodal repair. While gene therapies and myelin regeneration strategies are being developed to restore normal paranodal architecture, BIIB113 offers an adjunct pharmacological approach to immediately lower ectopic sodium influx and stabilize conduction until structural repair can be fully achieved. The combination of improved biophysical conduction profiles in preclinical models (demonstrated through electrophysiological assessments such as DRG patch-clamp recordings, compound action potential assays, and nerve conduction study enhancements) with favorable pharmacokinetics positions BIIB113 as a promising candidate to ameliorate the conduction deficits observed in CMT (Johnson et al., 2022; Kaloyanova, 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
BIIB113 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, particularly given its selective targeting of Nav1.6—a channel that has garnered interest primarily for its role in CNS hyperexcitability but is now recognized for its critical function in the peripheral nervous system as well. One of the principal strengths of BIIB113 is its impressive state-dependent mechanism that allows it to preferentially block pathological persistent and resurgent sodium currents while sparing normal transient currents. This specificity is crucial because it minimizes the risk of side effects that are often associated with broad-spectrum sodium channel blockers (Johnson et al., 2022; Zybura et al., 2021).

A further strength lies in its demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models; electrophysiological studies suggest that selective inhibition of Nav1.6 can restore normal conduction in rodent models exhibiting characteristics similar to those found in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. This is particularly significant given that the mislocalization and abnormal upregulation of Nav1.6 at disorganized nodes of Ranvier have been implicated in the pathophysiology of CMT, leading to ectopic firing and conduction block (Cazzato, 2020; Israel, 2019). In this context, BIIB113’s ability to enhance compound action potentials and reduce ectopic sodium influx addresses a key mechanism underlying the conduction failure in CMT. Additionally, preclinical pharmacokinetic studies confirming adequate peripheral nerve exposure at tolerated doses reinforce its potential as a clinically viable agent (Johnson et al., 2022).

However, several challenges must be noted. Despite the promising preclinical data, direct clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of BIIB113 in treating CMT is lacking. Most of the literature on BIIB113 centers on its development and application in SCN8A-related epilepsies, and even though the mechanistic rationale for repurposing it in CMT is strong, firm clinical trials and dedicated studies in CMT populations have not yet been reported (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, working in the peripheral nervous system poses distinct challenges: the differential expression of other sodium channel isoforms in peripheral nerves raises concerns that even a highly selective Nav1.6 blocker might elicit unforeseen off-target effects. For instance, though BIIB113 is designed to spare channels critical for normal conduction in muscle and cardiac tissue, the risk of collateral blockade in sensitive regions such as the phrenic nerve (which may express Nav1.6) has been noted for other similar compounds, potentially leading to respiratory issues if dosing is not carefully controlled (Klein et al., 2022).

A further consideration is the interplay between structural repair and electrophysiological stabilization in CMT therapy. While BIIB113 could provide an immediate reduction in aberrant excitability by normalizing ion channel function at disorganized nodes, it does not address the underlying demyelination or genetic defects that cause the nodal disarray. Thus, in a clinical setting, BIIB113 might best be used in combination with other therapies aimed at promoting remyelination or correcting structural abnormalities. In addition, the long-term effects of sustained Nav1.6 inhibition in peripheral nerves remain to be fully elucidated, especially given that Nav1.6 plays an important role in normal nerve physiology.

Despite these concerns, the molecular specificity and the mechanistic underpinnings of BIIB113 provide a robust rationale for its further investigation as a therapeutic agent in CMT. The current hypothesis – that BIIB113 will enhance conduction and reduce pathological hyperexcitability by selectively lowering persistent and resurgent sodium currents at disorganized nodes – is supported by detailed electrophysiological data in other contexts (Johnson et al., 2022; Kaloyanova, 2021). The translational potential of this approach is compelling, particularly in light of previous clinical experiences with sodium channel blockers in related peripheral neuropathies, such as the use of mexiletine for muscle cramps in CMT patients (Herrmann, 2015).

In summary, BIIB113 is a highly innovative compound with a clear molecular target and a strong state-dependent mechanism of action that holds promise for modulating the aberrant sodium currents associated with dysregulated nodes of Ranvier in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. Its strengths include:
– High potency and selectivity for Nav1.6, offering a precise method to modulate pathological persistent and resurgent currents (Johnson et al., 2022; Zybura et al., 2021).
– Favorable pharmacokinetic properties in preclinical studies, indicating reliable peripheral nerve exposure at therapeutically relevant concentrations (Johnson et al., 2022).
– A mechanistic hypothesis directly addressing the conduction failure observed in CMT due to mislocalized Nav1.6 channels at demyelinated or disorganized nodes (Cazzato, 2020; Israel, 2019).

Nevertheless, the weaknesses include:
– A significant gap in direct clinical or dedicated preclinical studies in CMT models; most available data derive from epilepsy-related investigations or models of neuropathic pain (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
– Uncertainties regarding potential off-target effects in peripheral tissues that may co-express Nav1.6, such as the phrenic nerve, raising safety concerns that must be thoroughly addressed in future studies (Klein et al., 2022).
– The need to consider BIIB113 as part of a multimodal therapeutic strategy, rather than a standalone treatment, due to its inability to directly correct the underlying demyelination and nodal structural abnormalities inherent to CMT.

Overall, BIIB113 shows significant promise as a therapeutic candidate for treating Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease by stabilizing action potential propagation through precise modulation of Nav1.6-mediated hyperexcitability. It represents a novel approach that can potentially complement structural repair modalities by addressing the electrophysiological dysfunction at disorganized nodes. However, before embarking on targeted clinical trials in CMT, further detailed preclinical studies in appropriate rodent models (e.g., Trembler-J and PMP22 duplication models) are needed to validate the mechanistic hypothesis, establish an optimized dosing regimen, and confirm the safety profile specific to the peripheral nervous system. With these additional data, BIIB113 could form a critical component of an integrated therapeutic strategy for CMT that combines molecular stabilization of conduction with longer-term structural repair interventions (Johnson et al., 2022; Kaloyanova, 2021).
