Proposal for Imatinib (c-Abl/PDGFR inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # SML1027)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Imatinib, catalogued here as Sigma-Aldrich SML1027, is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) originally developed for use in oncology. It was synthesized as part of an effort to target aberrant tyrosine kinases observed in malignancies, and its core chemical structure is based on phenylaminopyrimidine derivatives. In its development, imatinib was optimized to bind the ATP-binding pocket of several kinases in their inactive conformations, specifically inhibiting BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), as well as other kinases like platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-kit. This compound belongs to the TKI class, which has historically been used to treat a variety of cancers—including CML and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST)—by arresting kinase-mediated signaling pathways that drive uncontrolled cell proliferation (Angelbello et al., 2018, pp. 40–42).

Therapeutic History:
The clinical and biochemical history of imatinib is well established in oncology. It has been administered for CML, where its inhibition of the BCR-ABL fusion protein leads to high rates of complete hematologic and cytogenetic responses (Angelbello et al., 2018, pp. 40–42). Beyond its primary use, imatinib and related TKIs have been repurposed in several experimental and clinical settings for diseases affecting the peripheral nervous system. For example, it has been investigated in the context of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) to treat plexiform neurofibromas arising from Schwann cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014). Moreover, its use has been explored in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) in both oncology trials and veterinary settings, highlighting its activity in nerve sheath–derived tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006). In models of immune-mediated neuropathies, such as experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN)—an animal model analogous to Guillain-Barré syndrome—imatinib has been shown to improve blood-nerve barrier integrity and preserve nerve function (Kmezic, 2025, pp. 108–113; Kmezic, 2025, pp. 22–29). However, despite these diversified applications, imatinib has not been widely used clinically to treat hereditary demyelinating neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. The reported preclinical evidence in CMT models—indicating improved conduction velocity and reduced nodal gap spacing—remains limited primarily to rodent studies and in vitro assays using dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cocultures (Bombieri et al., 2024, pp. 10–12; Fletcher, 2018, pp. 30–34).

Mechanism of Action:
Imatinib’s mechanism of action is based on its high-affinity binding to the ATP-binding pocket of specific tyrosine kinases. It is most well-known for inhibiting the BCR-ABL kinase, responsible for the malignant phenotype observed in CML, but importantly for the current evaluation, it also inhibits PDGFR and c-Abl. The PDGFR has a crucial role in mediating Schwann cell proliferation and differentiation; its overactivation can lead to aberrant Schwann cell behavior. In addition, c-Abl is implicated in the regulation of cytoskeletal elements, and its aberrant activation has been linked to cytoskeletal disorganization within Schwann cells and other cell types. This disorganization can disrupt the proper localization of critical paranodal adhesion molecules such as neurofascin 155 (NF155) on Schwann cells and contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) on axons. These proteins are essential for maintaining the integrity of the paranodal junctions, which in turn support saltatory conduction in peripheral nerves (Angelbello et al., 2018, pp. 40–42; Chang, 2011, pp. 12–15). By inhibiting PDGFR-mediated aberrant signaling and c-Abl-mediated cytoskeletal collapse, imatinib is hypothesized to restore stress fiber organization and enhance the clustering of NF155 and Caspr1 at the paranodes, thereby stabilizing these domains. Detailed preclinical evidence suggests that such molecular corrections can lead to improved nerve conduction parameters, as seen in studies where imatinib treatment improved conduction velocity and reduced nodal gap spacing in CMT1A rodent models (Bombieri et al., 2024, pp. 10–12; Fletcher, 2018, pp. 30–34).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, imatinib is expected to exert a stabilizing effect on paranodal domains in the context of CMT by targeting two critical aberrant signaling pathways in Schwann cells. First, via its inhibition of PDGFR, imatinib should reduce abnormal Schwann cell proliferation—an event associated with dedifferentiation and loss of myelinating function—in conditions where PDGF signaling is aberrantly elevated. Second, by inhibiting c-Abl, imatinib is anticipated to restore normal cytoskeletal organization, thereby allowing proper intracellular trafficking and surface localization of paranodal adhesion molecules such as NF155 and Caspr1. The proper clustering of these proteins is essential for the maintenance of paranodal junctions, which secure the axo-glial interface and ensure effective saltatory conduction. Indeed, in in vitro DRG cocultures, treatment with imatinib has been observed to lead to enhanced clustering of NF155 and Caspr1, suggesting an improved structural organization of the nodes of Ranvier. Additionally, in CMT1A rodent models, imatinib treatment has been correlated with improvements in electrophysiological parameters—such as increased conduction velocity—and structural improvements observed under electron microscopy, such as reduced nodal gap spacing. This implies that imatinib’s dual inhibitory action on PDGFR and c-Abl could translate into a restoration of myelination integrity, potentially slowing or reversing the progressive demyelinating process characteristic of CMT (Bombieri et al., 2024, pp. 10–12; Kmezic, 2025, pp. 87–90). Importantly, the peripheral nerve penetration characteristics of imatinib, paired with documented human pharmacokinetics and safety data from its oncological use, support its translational feasibility. PDGFR and c-Abl are expressed in Schwann cells and their associated molecular pathways are implicated in the pathogenesis of demyelinating neuropathies, which provides a biochemical rationale for expecting a therapeutic benefit in CMT (Angelbello et al., 2018, pp. 42–43; Fletcher, 2018, pp. 30–34).

Overall Evaluation:
The repurposing of imatinib for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease presents a compelling hypothesis based on both its established biochemical mechanisms and emerging preclinical data. One of the main strengths of this therapeutic candidate is its dual mechanism of action that targets both PDGFR and c-Abl signaling pathways. By addressing these pathways, imatinib has the potential not only to suppress aberrant Schwann cell proliferation but also to correct cytoskeletal disorganization, thereby restoring the localization of paranodal proteins essential for nodal maintenance and nerve conduction (Angelbello et al., 2018, pp. 40–42; Chang, 2011, pp. 12–15). In vitro data from DRG coculture assays and preclinical studies in CMT1A rodent models indicate that imatinib can enhance paranodal organization through increased clustering of NF155/Caspr1 and concomitantly improve electrophysiological parameters such as conduction velocity and nodal gap spacing (Bombieri et al., 2024, pp. 10–12; Fletcher, 2018, pp. 30–34).

Additionally, imatinib’s therapeutic history is robust given its extensive use in oncology with well-documented pharmacokinetic profiles, acceptable safety margins, and known peripheral nerve penetration. This established background facilitates the potential regulatory and translational pathway for repurposing imatinib in a non-oncological indication such as CMT. In vivo studies in animal models of immune-mediated neuropathies, where imatinib has been shown to restore blood-nerve barrier integrity and reduce neuroinflammation, further reinforce its capacity to modulate peripheral nerve physiology under pathologic conditions (Kmezic, 2025, pp. 108–113; Kmezic, 2025, pp. 22–29).

However, several concerns warrant careful consideration. First, while imatinib’s mechanism of action logically extends to potentially beneficial effects in CMT, the direct clinical use of imatinib in inherited demyelinating neuropathies such as CMT has not been previously reported or extensively explored. Most of the supporting evidence stems from oncology applications or studies in immune-mediated neuropathy models (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006). Second, there is an inherent risk that TKIs, including imatinib, may have off-target effects or induce peripheral neurotoxicity—which have been observed as adverse events in some patients receiving these drugs for cancer treatment (Laforgia et al., 2021, pp. 12–13). Therefore, distinguishing the neuroprotective effects expected from imatinib in CMT from potential neurotoxic side effects will be critical. Third, while preclinical data from rodent models and DRG cocultures are promising, they have yet to be robustly confirmed in large-scale or clinical studies specific to CMT. The heterogeneity of CMT subtypes and the variable expression of kinases in different genetic backgrounds may also influence therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, the precise mechanism by which imatinib modulates cytoskeletal organization and paranodal protein clustering in Schwann cells remains to be fully elucidated; additional mechanistic studies focusing on PDGFR/c-Abl signaling in Schwann cells would help to solidify the rationale for its use in CMT (Chang, 2011, pp. 12–15; Fletcher, 2018, pp. 30–34).

Overall, imatinib represents a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease due to its known mechanism of inhibiting PDGFR and c-Abl, which are implicated in Schwann cell dysfunction and paranodal disorganization in demyelinating neuropathies. Its established use in oncology provides a wealth of safety and pharmacokinetic data, and emerging preclinical evidence suggests that it can enhance paranodal protein clustering and improve nerve conduction parameters in rodent models of CMT. Nevertheless, the lack of direct clinical evidence in CMT, potential risks of neurotoxicity, and the need for further mechanistic studies in Schwann cell biology indicate that while the candidate is scientifically compelling, rigorous preclinical validation and cautious clinical trial design will be required to confirm its therapeutic potential (ClinicalTrials.gov; Kmezic, 2025, pp. 87–90; Litterman et al., 2014, p. 12). In summary, imatinib has significant strengths as a mechanistically rational candidate with excellent translational feasibility, yet its repurposing for CMT will require addressing key gaps in direct efficacy data and understanding its long-term effects on peripheral nerve structure and function.
