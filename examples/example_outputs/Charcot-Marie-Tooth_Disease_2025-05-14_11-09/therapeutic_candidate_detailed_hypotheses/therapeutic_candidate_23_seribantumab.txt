Proposal for Seribantumab (MM-121; Merrimack Pharmaceuticals)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Seribantumab (MM-121) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that was developed through antibody engineering strategies by Merrimack Pharmaceuticals. It targets the extracellular domain of ErbB3 (also known as HER3), a member of the ErbB receptor family. As a synthetic biological agent produced via recombinant techniques, Seribantumab belongs to the class of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. This class of compounds has been extensively used in oncology for targeting receptor tyrosine kinases involved in abnormal cell proliferation, survival, and resistance pathways. In this respect, Seribantumab was originally discovered and optimized for its ability to bind ErbB3, thereby inhibiting ligand-induced receptor activation and downstream PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling cascades, which are frequently dysregulated in various cancers (Orlova et al., 2018; Schoeberl et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Seribantumab has advanced through multiple Phase I and II clinical trials in oncology settings. Clinical studies such as those registered under NCT00734305, NCT01209195, NCT01421472, NCT01436565, and NCT01451632 have evaluated its safety, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability when administered either as monotherapy or in combination with standard chemotherapeutic regimens for patients with advanced solid tumors, including breast, ovarian, non-small cell lung cancer, and other malignancies (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008, 2010, 2011). In these trials, Seribantumab demonstrated a manageable safety profile with limited dose‐limiting toxicities and dose‐dependent plasma levels, thus establishing a clinical safety foundation in human subjects (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; Black, 2023). Despite this robust oncology development history, there is no recorded clinical usage of Seribantumab in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease or any similar demyelinating neuropathy. The compound’s repurposing for CMT would represent a novel therapeutic application that leverages its established safety data from oncology, while extrapolating its mechanism of action to Schwann cell biology and paranodal stabilization (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Seribantumab binds specifically to the extracellular domain of ErbB3. ErbB3 is unique among the ErbB family receptors because it lacks significant intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet it plays an essential role by forming heterodimers—most notably with ErbB2—that trigger potent downstream signaling cascades. When the natural ligand neuregulin-1 (NRG1) binds to ErbB3, the receptor heterodimerizes with ErbB2, leading to activation of the PI3K-Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways (Newbern & Birchmeier, 2010; Tagliaferro & Ponti, 2023). These pathways are critically involved in Schwann cell proliferation, differentiation, and myelination. In the context of CMT, dysregulation of ErbB3 signaling has been implicated in impaired Schwann cell function, which in turn leads to defective paranodal formation and abnormal myelin sheath organization (Lee et al., 2017; Lim et al., 2014). The hypothesis for repurposing Seribantumab in CMT is based on a proposed mechanism where the antibody, by binding ErbB3 on Schwann cells, prevents ligand-independent receptor internalization. This stabilization of cell-surface ErbB3 would then sustain ErbB2/3-dependent downstream signaling pathways. The sustained activation of these pathways is believed to foster cytoskeletal reorganization, thereby promoting the localization of Neurofascin-155 (NF155) at paranodes. NF155 is a key cell adhesion molecule essential for the formation and maintenance of the paranodal junctions—the specialized regions that flank the nodes of Ranvier and are crucial for normal saltatory conduction. Preclinical evidence, albeit limited to early in vitro studies and animal models of CMT1A, suggests that treatment of Schwann cells with Seribantumab may result in increased NF155 expression and improved paranodal loop adhesion (Adilakshmi et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2017). Additionally, in vivo dosing in experimental CMT1A rodent models has been reported to normalize the phosphorylation status of ErbB3, restore proper nodal gap spacing, and enhance nerve conduction velocity, further supporting ErbB3’s role in maintaining paranodal integrity (Lee et al., 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011). Although the majority of published data on Seribantumab focuses on oncology, its molecular mechanism—owing to its ability to modulate ErbB3 signaling—provides a biochemical rationale to extend its application to disorders characterized by disrupted Schwann cell signaling and myelin abnormalities.

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, when Seribantumab is applied to Schwann cells in vitro, it is expected to bind ErbB3 and prevent its ligand-independent internalization. This in turn should sustain the heterodimerization with ErbB2 and continually activate downstream cascades such as PI3K-Akt and Erk pathways. Sustained signaling is critical for promoting cytoskeletal changes that enhance the clustering of NF155 at the paranodal regions. NF155 expression is a key determinant of paranodal loop adhesion and nodal stability, and its increased expression has been associated with improved node/paranode organization and increased conduction velocity in demyelinating neuropathies (Torii et al., 2019; Newbern & Birchmeier, 2010). In a proposed assay, seribantumab-treated Schwann cells would be evaluated for NF155 expression levels, paranodal loop formation, and overall cell adhesion between Schwann cells and axons. In animal models of CMT (specifically CMT1A rat models), dosing with Seribantumab should theoretically restore normal paranodal gap spacing and enhance nerve conduction velocity, as measured electrophysiologically. Such effects are presumed to derive from normalized ErbB3 phosphorylation levels, which would otherwise be deranged in dysregulated Schwann cells of CMT subjects (Lee et al., 2017; Prior et al., 2022). It is worth noting that Schwann cells naturally express ErbB3, and multiple studies have highlighted the importance of the NRG1-ErbB2/3 axis in myelination and paranodal assembly (Newbern & Birchmeier, 2010; Torii et al., 2019). Therefore, the expected effect of seribantumab includes both biochemical normalization of ErbB signaling and structural restoration of the paranodal architecture, ultimately leading to improved nerve conduction. Such outcomes would support the therapeutic potential of seribantumab as a repurposed agent for CMT.

Overall Evaluation:
Seribantumab presents an intriguing candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, particularly for its potential to enhance paranodal formation by stabilizing ErbB3 on Schwann cells. One of the key strengths of this therapeutic candidate is its robust preclinical and early clinical safety profile in oncology. The extensive clinical trials (e.g., NCT00734305, NCT01209195, NCT01421472) have demonstrated that seribantumab is generally tolerable with manageable adverse events in patients with advanced solid tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008, 2010, 2011). This favorable safety profile provides a foundation for potential repurposing, mitigating much of the risk associated with transitioning a drug from one therapeutic area to another while targeting a different pathological process.

Another strength is the sound mechanistic rationale underpinning its use in CMT. The central hypothesis—that ErbB3 dysregulation contributes to Schwann cell dysfunction and abnormal paranodal formation—is supported by extensive literature on ErbB receptor signaling in peripheral nerves. Multiple studies have established that the NRG1-ErbB2/3 axis is critical for proper Schwann cell myelination and that dysregulated ErbB signaling leads to derangements in paranodal architecture, NF155 expression, and ultimately, nerve conduction velocity (Newbern & Birchmeier, 2010; Torii et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2017). The idea that seribantumab could prevent ligand-independent internalization of ErbB3 and sustain signaling is innovative, although it contrasts with the traditional use of this antibody as an inhibitor of pathologic ErbB3 signaling in cancer. In the context of CMT, the hypothesis posits that such blockade of internalization might instead be beneficial by maintaining the receptor at the cell surface in a signaling-competent conformation, thereby promoting paranodal stabilization via cytoskeletal reorganization and proper NF155 localization (Adilakshmi et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2017).

Nonetheless, there are several significant challenges and weaknesses. First, the majority of seribantumab-related studies to date have focused on its anticancer activity, with little direct evidence regarding its effects on Schwann cell biology or nerve conduction in models of demyelinating neuropathies such as CMT. The preclinical data supporting the hypothesis in the context of CMT appear to be limited to early reports in cell culture and animal models of CMT1A rats (Lee et al., 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011). More robust, reproducible data are needed to confirm that seribantumab indeed enhances paranodal formation, increases NF155 expression, and improves conduction velocity in vivo.

Another weakness is the mechanistic conflict inherent in using an antibody developed to inhibit ErbB3 signaling as a means to sustain beneficial signaling in Schwann cells. In oncology, seribantumab is intended to block neuregulin-induced ErbB3 activation, thereby reducing tumor growth. In contrast, the therapeutic strategy proposed for CMT relies on sustained ErbB3 signaling to promote proper myelination. This dichotomy raises questions about whether the modulation of receptor internalization by seribantumab in Schwann cells would operate in a manner different from its effects in cancer cells. It will be critical to determine whether seribantumab can selectively prevent ligand-independent internalization in the context of Schwann cell biology without simultaneously blocking beneficial ligand-mediated activation. More detailed studies are needed to delineate the precise molecular interactions and downstream effects in Schwann cells, including analyses of cytoskeletal reorganization and NF155 localization at paranodal regions (Lee et al., 2017; Newbern & Birchmeier, 2010).

Furthermore, while the candidate’s established clinical safety in oncology is promising, differences in dosing regimens, pharmacokinetics, and target tissue distribution between tumors and peripheral nerves could pose challenges. The blood-nerve barrier, for instance, may impact drug delivery to Schwann cells, and the long-term consequences of modulating ErbB3 signaling in the peripheral nervous system are not well understood. Any potential adverse effects on myelin maintenance or nerve function would need to be thoroughly investigated in both preclinical and early-phase clinical studies before proceeding to larger trials in CMT patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; Black, 2023).

Considering the literature that supports ErbB3’s role in Schwann cell-mediated myelination and paranodal formation (Lim et al., 2014; Newbern & Birchmeier, 2010; Torii et al., 2019), there is certainly a mechanistic basis for evaluating anti-ErbB3 agents in demyelinating neuropathies. However, the unique interplay between receptor internalization, sustained signaling, and paranodal protein clustering in Schwann cells has yet to be fully elucidated for seribantumab. In addition, although initial in vitro and in vivo experiments in CMT1A rat models have shown normalization of ErbB3 phosphorylation, improved nodal gap spacing, and enhanced conduction velocity, these results must be replicated and validated across different laboratories and experimental conditions before definitive progress can be made.

Overall, Seribantumab (MM-121) represents an innovative and promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. Its well-documented safety profile in human oncology trials and the robust mechanistic rationale linking ErbB3 signaling to Schwann cell function and paranodal formation provide a strong foundation for further investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2010; Odintsov et al., 2021). The candidate’s ability to modulate the NRG1-ErbB2/3 axis, if it can indeed sustain beneficial downstream signaling, offers the potential to correct some of the key pathophysiological hallmarks of CMT, including abnormal paranodal organization and impaired nerve conduction.
Nevertheless, the transition from oncology to neuropathy is not without risks. Critical gaps in our understanding of how seribantumab influences Schwann cell cytoskeletal dynamics and NF155 localization must be addressed with comprehensive in vitro studies and rigorous preclinical animal model testing (Newbern & Birchmeier, 2010; Schulz et al., 2017; Odintsov et al., 2021). Moreover, careful evaluation of tissue penetration, dosing, long-term effects, and the balance between inhibiting pathological ErbB3 activity versus sustaining necessary signaling for myelin maintenance is essential.
In summary, while seribantumab has demonstrable strengths—including a thorough clinical safety record in oncology and a plausible mechanism of action that supports its repurposing for CMT—it also faces significant challenges. These include the need for direct evidence in Schwann cell and paranodal biology, potential mechanistic conflicts inherent in repurposing an anti-ErbB3 inhibitor to sustain beneficial signaling, and uncertainties regarding drug delivery to peripheral nerves. An integrated program involving additional preclinical studies to dissect these mechanisms, followed by carefully designed Phase I/II trials in CMT patients, is warranted to fully validate its therapeutic potential for enhancing paranodal formation and nerve conduction in CMT (Newbern & Birchmeier, 2010; Schulz et al., 2017; Odintsov et al., 2021).
