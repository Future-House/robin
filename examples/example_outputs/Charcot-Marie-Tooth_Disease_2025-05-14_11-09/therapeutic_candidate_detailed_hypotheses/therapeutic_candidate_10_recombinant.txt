Proposal for Recombinant Human Neuregulin-1β1 EGF-like Domain (rhNRG1β1; R&D Systems catalog # 396-NR)

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of recombinant human neuregulin‐1β1 (rhNRG1β1) with its EGF‐like domain as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease. This review covers the origins and classification of the candidate, its therapeutic history, the detailed mechanism of action, the expected effects in relevant assays and disease models, and an overall evaluation with its strengths and weaknesses. All sections are supported by literature evidence drawn exclusively from the provided context.

I. Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Recombinant human neuregulin‐1β1 (rhNRG1β1) is an engineered protein that reproduces the biologically active fragment of the endogenous neuregulin‐1 form. This candidate is produced by expressing the β1 isoform of neuregulin‐1, specifically containing its critical EGF‐like domain that is essential for binding to ErbB receptors. Neuregulin‐1 is a ligand that naturally mediates cell–cell communication and tissue regeneration by engaging receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly from the ErbB family. In its recombinant form, rhNRG1β1 is synthesized through molecular cloning in an appropriate expression system, typically mammalian cells, which allows for post‐translational modifications that closely mimic the native protein. As such, it belongs to the class of recombinant protein therapeutics that have historically been developed for applications in regenerative medicine and are known to be effective when their dosing and distribution are controlled. This approach is exemplified by the widespread use of growth factors across various therapeutic areas including cardiovascular repair and acute injury models, where proteins that activate specific signaling cascades are employed to restore tissue function (Cespedes et al., 2018). The rationale for repurposing rhNRG1β1 for CMT stems from its known ability to engage ErbB receptors that play a pivotal role in Schwann cell function and myelination, a critical consideration given the demyelinating nature of CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

II. Therapeutic History
The therapeutic history of recombinant neuregulin‐1 variants is extensive and underpinned by both preclinical studies and early clinical trials in non‐neurological indications. Various recombinant forms of neuregulin‐1 have been evaluated in preclinical models for their ability to influence tissue repair. For instance, endogenous neuregulin‐1 has been shown to be essential for Schwann cell survival, differentiation, and proper myelination during development and after nerve injury, suggesting that exogenously administered recombinant neuregulin‐1 can modulate peripheral nerve biology (Fricker & Bennett, 2011). Preclinical work in rodent models, including transgenic animals that mimic aspects of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, has illustrated that neuregulin‐1 administration improves remyelination and axonal conduction by modulating ErbB receptor phosphorylation and intracellular signaling pathways. Studies in transgenic models have demonstrated that early treatment with neuregulin‐1 can normalize ErbB2 phosphorylation levels, restore actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and promote the reestablishment of paranodal junctions, as confirmed by ultrastructural data such as electron microscopy (Scapin et al., 2019). Furthermore, in models of nerve injury and experimental demyelination, administration of neuregulin‐1 or its derivatives has been associated with improved nerve conduction velocity and better compound muscle action potentials (CMAP), outcomes that are directly relevant to the clinical manifestations of CMT (Hajjar, 2018). Although most of these preclinical studies have been designed to address the biology of peripheral nerve repair, recombinant neuregulin‐1 derivatives have also been evaluated in human clinical trials for cardiac indications. For example, several clinical trials carried out in the context of heart failure – such as those with endpoints measuring left ventricular function – have confirmed that recombinant neuregulin‐1 is safe in humans and exhibits favorable pharmacokinetic properties (Sawyer & Caggiano, 2011; Cespedes et al., 2018). To date, there are no published clinical trial data directly testing rhNRG1β1 in CMT patients; however, the wealth of preclinical evidence in rodent models of demyelinating neuropathies strongly supports the potential utility of this compound when repurposed for CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

III. Mechanism of Action
The mechanism by which rhNRG1β1 is proposed to exert its therapeutic effects is based on its ability to mimic the biological activity of endogenous neuregulin‐1 and to activate canonical ErbB receptor complexes on Schwann cells. Under physiological circumstances, neuregulin‐1 signals via receptor heterodimers composed primarily of ErbB2 and ErbB3 on the surface of Schwann cells. Binding of the EGF‐like domain of neuregulin‐1 to these receptors induces dimerization, which then triggers tyrosine autophosphorylation of the intracellular domains of the receptors. This phosphorylation cascade creates docking sites for proteins that initiate downstream signaling pathways, most notably the PI3K/Akt cascade (Fricker & Bennett, 2011; Scapin et al., 2019).

Activation of PI3K catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, thereby recruiting and activating Akt. The Akt pathway then promotes cellular survival, growth, and differentiation. In Schwann cells, activation of Akt is critical for inducing cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for proper myelination. Specifically, the dynamic regulation of actin filaments under Akt signaling is essential for the formation and maintenance of paranodal loops. These structures are responsible for the compartmentalization of ion channels and for establishing the precise localization of proteins such as neurofascin 155 (NF155) on the glial side and caspr1 on the axonal side at paranodal junctions (Scapin et al., 2019).

Beyond the PI3K/Akt pathway, neuregulin‐1 binding to ErbB receptors also facilitates activation of additional cascades including the MAPK/ERK pathway and calcineurin/NFAT pathways, which further contribute to gene expression programs that regulate Schwann cell differentiation and myelin production (Fricker & Bennett, 2011). Collectively, these signaling pathways modulate the actin cytoskeleton and control transcriptional programs needed for the synthesis of myelin proteins and lipids. In the context of CMT, where paranodal architecture is disrupted and myelin integrity is compromised, administration of rhNRG1β1 is expected to normalize the downstream signaling events, leading to proper actin reorganization and restoration of paranodal protein complexes. Preclinical studies have provided evidence that exogenous neuregulin‐1 can indeed normalize ErbB2 phosphorylation and the actin cytoskeletal balance in Schwann cells, correlating with improvements in nodal/paranodal structures as seen in electron microscopy analyses (Scapin et al., 2019; Fricker & Bennett, 2011). This precise engagement of ErbB2/3 receptors is central to the candidate’s proposed mechanism, as it triggers intracellular events that facilitate remyelination and the reestablishment of proper paranodal junctions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

IV. Expected Effect
The expected effect of rhNRG1β1 administration in a CMT context is based on improvements both at the molecular and functional levels that address core aspects of the neuropathology. First, by engaging ErbB2/3 receptors on Schwann cells, rhNRG1β1 is hypothesized to restore normal phosphorylation dynamics. In pathological states such as CMT, disrupted ErbB2/3 signaling has been associated with aberrant cytoskeletal organization and improper localization of paranodal proteins. Reducing these abnormalities will likely lead to restoration of paranodal architecture, as evidenced by improved alignment and clustering of NF155 and caspr1 at nerve domains critical for saltatory conduction (Scapin et al., 2019; Fricker & Bennett, 2011).

Second, since Schwann cells rely on accurate intracellular signaling for differentiation and myelin formation, activation of PI3K/Akt signaling by rhNRG1β1 should boost remyelination and enhance the reconstruction of paranodal loops. Experimental models of nerve injury and CMT have demonstrated that treatment with neuregulin‐1 leads to increased Schwann cell proliferation, enhanced actin reorganization, and subsequent improvements in myelin sheath thickness. These structural improvements are directly linked to functional outcomes such as increased nerve conduction velocity and better compound muscle action potential amplitudes (Hajjar, 2018; Scapin et al., 2019).

Third, the pharmacokinetic profile of recombinant neuregulin‐1 preparations—as seen in clinical studies in heart failure—suggests that when administered systemically, the compound is capable of reaching peripheral nerve tissues. This distribution is crucial because it ensures that sufficient local concentrations of rhNRG1β1 are available to activate ErbB receptors on Schwann cells in regions affected by demyelination. Although most clinical studies so far have focused on cardiac endpoints, they demonstrate a safe window for systemic administration that can be adapted for targeting peripheral nerves (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In CMT disease models, one would expect that treatment with rhNRG1β1 would lead to normalization of the disorganized paranodal junctions that are typically seen in these neuropathies. Electron microscopy studies in animal models have shown that neuregulin‐1 administration can reestablish paranodal loops and improve the localization of key adhesion proteins. Functionally, these improvements are anticipated to translate to enhanced saltatory conduction along nerve fibers, resulting in clinically demonstrable benefits such as increased nerve conduction velocity, enhanced muscle responses, and, ultimately, improvements in motor function. Furthermore, the candidates’ activation of downstream cytoskeletal pathways could stabilize Schwann cell-axon interactions, thereby contributing to longer-term preservation of nerve integrity even in the face of ongoing pathogenic challenges (Scapin et al., 2019; Gambarotta et al., 2013).

V. Overall Evaluation
Overall, recombinant human neuregulin‐1β1 represents a compelling candidate for repurposing as a treatment for CMT due to its well-established role in activating the neuregulin/ErbB pathway in Schwann cells and promoting myelination. The scientific rationale for its use in CMT is robust, drawing from both detailed mechanistic studies and preclinical models that collectively indicate several key points:

• rhNRG1β1 specifically targets ErbB2/3 receptors on Schwann cells, thereby initiating a cascade of intracellular events including the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and downstream cytoskeletal reorganization. This mechanism is critical for the restoration of paranodal junction integrity as the proper localization of NF155 and caspr1 is dependent on these signaling events (Fricker & Bennett, 2011; Scapin et al., 2019).

• Preclinical evidence, primarily derived from transgenic rodent models of demyelinating neuropathies, demonstrates that neuregulin‐1 administration not only normalizes ErbB2 phosphorylation but also results in measurable improvements in nerve conduction and myelination. Electron microscopic analyses from these studies reveal that paranodal structures are realigned after treatment, and electrophysiological recordings show enhanced nerve conduction velocity and compound muscle action potentials (Scapin et al., 2019; Hajjar, 2018).

• The favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles established in analogous clinical trials – especially those conducted in cardiac patients – provide a strong translational foundation. Although these studies were not conducted in a neuropathic context, the systemic administration of recombinant neuregulin‐1 has been shown to be well tolerated in humans and is associated with evidence of target engagement via ErbB receptor activation (Sawyer & Caggiano, 2011; Cespedes et al., 2018).

• The candidate’s mechanism of action, which leverages the intrinsic biology of Schwann cells, directly addresses a fundamental aspect of CMT pathology. Since CMT is characterized by demyelination and abnormal paranodal junction architecture, the ability of rhNRG1β1 to restore actin cytoskeletal balance and to reestablish the proper clustering of paranodal proteins is highly relevant. This targeted approach could ultimately lead to improved clinical outcomes in patients by enhancing nerve conduction and overall neuromuscular function (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, there are important limitations to consider in this evaluation:

• Although abundant preclinical data support the potential of neuregulin‐1 in modulating myelination and paranodal architecture, direct clinical evidence of efficacy in CMT patients is lacking. Most clinical data for recombinant neuregulin‐1 have been derived from studies in cardiac populations, and it remains to be determined whether similar beneficial effects can be replicated in a peripheral neuropathy setting (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

• The therapeutic intervention must achieve precise modulation of ErbB receptor activity; both hypoactivation and hyperactivation can have deleterious consequences. Thus, careful titration of rhNRG1β1 dosing will be critical, especially because aberrant ErbB2 phosphorylation has been linked to pathological outcomes in experimental models (Fricker & Bennett, 2011).

• While pharmacokinetic studies in cardiac settings suggest acceptable systemic exposure, the ability of rhNRG1β1 to reach effective concentrations in peripheral nerve tissues and reliably cross barriers to access the target Schwann cells must be confirmed through dedicated pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies in models that mimic the human condition (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

• CMT is a heterogeneous disease that involves not only demyelination but also significant axonal degeneration in some cases. It is possible that while rhNRG1β1 may be effective in restoring myelin integrity and paranodal junctions, additional interventions might be necessary to fully address axonal loss and ensure long-term functional recovery. Combination therapies may ultimately prove more efficacious than a single-agent approach (Cespedes et al., 2018).

In summary, the multifaceted literature evidence strongly supports the rationale for repurposing rhNRG1β1 as a therapeutic candidate for CMT. Its capacity to engage ErbB2/3 receptors on Schwann cells, normalize critical intracellular signaling cascades such as the PI3K/Akt pathway, and restore the structural integrity of paranodal junctions offers a clear mechanistic link to the pathogenesis of CMT. Improvements in nerve conduction velocity and CMAP observed in preclinical studies further underscore its potential to yield functional benefits. Moreover, the established human safety profile of recombinant neuregulin‐1 from cardiovascular trials provides a significant translational advantage that could accelerate its clinical development for neuropathic indications.

Nonetheless, the path forward requires addressing several key gaps. Rigorous preclinical studies focusing on the direct effects of rhNRG1β1 on paranodal junction proteins—specifically NF155 and caspr1—as well as comprehensive electrophysiological assessments in animal models that recapitulate the human CMT phenotype, are critical. In addition, studies examining the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of rhNRG1β1 in the peripheral nervous system must be prioritized to ensure that the necessary therapeutic levels are achievable in affected nerves. Determining the optimal dosing regimen and defining the therapeutic window to avoid potential off-target effects will be essential steps before clinical translation can be considered.

Overall, based on the current evidence, recombinant human neuregulin‐1β1 exhibits significant promise as a repurposed agent for CMT. Its strong mechanistic foundation, combined with encouraging preclinical results in terms of paranodal restoration and electrophysiological improvement, support further investigation. Our recommendation is to advance toward targeted preclinical studies in well-characterized CMT models—employing detailed ultrastructural analyses, molecular endpoint validation, and functional nerve assessments—and to design early-phase clinical trials upon demonstration of efficacy in these models. Given the depth of available data linking ErbB signaling to Schwann cell function and myelination, rhNRG1β1 could become a transformative therapy for patients suffering from demyelinating neuropathies such as CMT, provided that subsequent studies overcome the challenges of optimal delivery and dosage (Scapin et al., 2019; Fricker & Bennett, 2011).

In conclusion, while additional research is needed to firmly establish its clinical utility in CMT, the combination of a well-defined mechanism, promising preclinical outcomes, and a favorable safety background from previous cardiovascular studies positions rhNRG1β1 as a highly promising candidate. Moving forward, the strategic focus should be on addressing the pharmacokinetic profile in peripheral nerves, confirming the restoration of paranodal junction integrity at the molecular level, and thoroughly evaluating electrophysiological improvements in validated animal models of CMT. This rational and stepwise approach will help bridge the gap between promising laboratory findings and eventual clinical efficacy, offering hope for improved outcomes in patients with Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cespedes et al., 2018).
