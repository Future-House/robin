Proposal for Fasudil (HA-1077; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # F1620)

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of fasudil (HA-1077; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # F1620) as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. In the sections that follow, we appraise its synthetic origins and chemical class, review its historic therapeutic applications in both vascular and neurological settings, detail its molecular mechanism of action with respect to ROCK inhibition, discuss the expected effects on paranodal junction integrity in the context of demyelinating pathology, and conclude with an overall evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses for potential use in CMT.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Fasudil is a synthetic small-molecule drug developed from an isoquinoline sulfonylamide scaffold. Its initial synthesis involved converting fasudil hydrochloride to the free base, then employing chemical protection strategies (for example, Boc-protection) followed by oxidation and subsequent derivatization steps such as benzoylation and alkylation with a 4-nitrobenzyl bromide. These synthetic manipulations yielded a compound with a defined isoquinoline ring structure conjugated through a sulfonyl linker to a homopiperazine moiety. Fasudil belongs to the therapeutic class of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitors that act by competitively binding to the ATP-binding pocket of ROCK enzymes. This binding impedes the kinase’s ability to phosphorylate downstream substrates involved in actin-myosin contractility. Fasudil is thus regarded as a prototypical ROCK inhibitor that has been extensively studied over the past few decades; such agents have historically been used as vasodilators to ameliorate conditions like cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as in experimental models of neuroprotection (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013). The molecule’s chemical structure, with specific emphasis on the isoquinoline core and its homopiperazine appendage, provides critical interactions with the catalytic domains of ROCK enzymes. As such, the synthetic origins and chemical modifications of fasudil have been optimized for robust kinase inhibition, as evidenced by subsequent analyses using methods such as NMR, HPLC, and mass spectrometry (Al-Hilal et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History
Fasudil was first introduced clinically in Japan, where it was approved for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. In its primary indication, fasudil exerts vasodilatory effects through inhibition of vascular smooth muscle contraction mediated by ROCK. Over the years, extensive clinical data have been accumulated regarding its safety, pharmacokinetics, and tissue distribution. Fasudil has not only been applied in cerebral vasospasm but has also been investigated in a variety of vascular disorders such as angina pectoris, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and stable effort angina—all conditions where reduction in vascular tone is therapeutically beneficial (Chen et al., 2013; Dong et al., 2010). In addition, preclinical studies have documented fasudil’s neuroprotective effects. Investigational studies in models of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and even compassionate use trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have yielded encouraging results. These studies demonstrate that ROCK inhibition by fasudil leads to improvements in neuronal survival and functional recovery in various central nervous system (CNS) injury models (Koch et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2007). Importantly, although fasudil has not been directly tested in clinical trials involving Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, preclinical investigations in rodent models—specifically CMT1A transgenic rats—have shown that systemic administration of fasudil increases internodal length and enhances nerve conduction velocities. In those studies, biochemical markers such as reduced phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) in peripheral nerves were observed, and ultrastructural analyses confirmed the restoration of paranodal loop adhesion and the reformation of septate junctions (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013). These findings provide the rationale for further exploration of fasudil in demyelinating peripheral neuropathies, particularly in the context of CMT (Chen et al., 2013).

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, fasudil acts as a competitive inhibitor of Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCK1 and ROCK2) through its interaction with the ATP-binding pocket on the enzyme’s catalytic domain. Detailed structural analyses have shown that the isoquinoline ring of fasudil occupies the adenine subsite of the kinase domain, forming key hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues essential for catalytic activity (Mueller et al., 2005). Meanwhile, the attached homopiperazine moiety engages with hydrophobic regions adjacent to the ATP-binding site. This dual interaction significantly inhibits the kinase’s ability to phosphorylate downstream targets such as myosin light chain (MLC) and myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1). The inhibition of MLC phosphorylation directly translates into a reduction in actomyosin contractility, a process central to the pathophysiology of vascular contraction and cytoskeletal dynamics (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013).

Of particular interest in the context of CMT is the role of ROCK—especially the isoform ROCK2—in regulating the cytoskeletal tension of Schwann cells. Schwann cells are responsible for myelinating peripheral axons and for maintaining the specialized structures known as paranodal junctions. These junctions are formed by a complex involving Caspr1, Contactin, and Neurofascin, which are essential for saltatory conduction. Under pathological conditions seen in CMT, aberrant ROCK activity leads to excessive phosphorylation of MLC, inducing hypercontractility in Schwann cells. This increase in cortical tension disrupts the proper assembly or maintenance of paranodal junctions, thereby impairing normal nerve conduction (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013). Fasudil, by inhibiting ROCK, decreases MLC phosphorylation, which in turn reduces Schwann cell contractility. The subsequent lowering of cortical tension is hypothesized to facilitate the reestablishment of the critical adhesion complexes required for paranodal integrity (Chen et al., 2013). Furthermore, the active metabolite of fasudil, hydroxyfasudil, exhibits enhanced ROCK inhibitory potency and contributes to the overall pharmacodynamic outcome by extending the duration of ROCK inhibition (Dong et al., 2010; Halasz & Townes-Anderson, 2016).

Additionally, it is important to note that while fasudil is not completely selective for ROCK2 and also inhibits ROCK1, the dominant expression of ROCK2 in neural and glial tissues makes its net effect particularly relevant for the peripheral nerve compartments. Biochemical studies have established that reduction in MLC phosphorylation following fasudil treatment is correlated with improved cytoskeletal dynamics and normalized cellular contractility (Chen et al., 2013; Liao et al., 2007). Through these interactions and the subsequent biochemical cascades, fasudil creates a cellular environment conducive to axonal regeneration and remyelination—a critical component in addressing the conduction deficits observed in CMT (Al-Hilal et al., 2021).

Expected Effect
In Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease—particularly the CMT1A subtype—the central pathological feature is the disruption of paranodal junctions that flank the nodes of Ranvier. This disruption is believed to result, at least in part, from an imbalance in the actomyosin contractile apparatus within Schwann cells. An overactive ROCK pathway increases MLC phosphorylation, thereby escalating cortical tension in Schwann cells. The hypothesis under evaluation posits that treatment with fasudil will restore paranodal junction integrity by inhibiting ROCK, effectively reducing MLC phosphorylation and thus decreasing Schwann cell contractility.

Preclinical studies conducted in CMT1A transgenic rats have provided encouraging results that support this hypothesis. Specifically, treated animals exhibited an increase in internodal length and improved nerve conduction velocity, both of which are indicative of enhanced neural function. These functional improvements were accompanied by biochemical evidence showing decreased phosphorylation levels of MLC in peripheral nerves, which serves as a direct marker of effective ROCK inhibition (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013). Furthermore, ultrastructural analyses in these models have revealed a normalization of paranodal loop adhesion and re‐formation of septate junctions, which are critical for maintaining the specialized architecture necessary for rapid and efficient saltatory conduction (Chen et al., 2013; Rayner, 2019).

The ability of fasudil to cross the blood–nerve barrier is also paramount when considering its application in peripheral neuropathies. Pharmacokinetic studies in both vascular and CNS settings have demonstrated that fasudil is capable of reaching therapeutically relevant concentrations in target tissues. This property is especially beneficial in diseases like CMT, where the therapeutic agent must reach and act on Schwann cells residing in peripheral nerves (Dong et al., 2010; Halasz & Townes-Anderson, 2016). Once delivered, the drug’s ROCK inhibition leads to reduced actomyosin contractility, which is not only expected to restore proper paranodal architecture but may also enhance overall axonal regeneration and remyelination. Ultimately, these effects should translate into improved conduction velocities and better functional outcomes for patients suffering from CMT.

Experimental assays designed to evaluate the efficacy of fasudil in CMT would therefore measure multiple endpoints. First, biochemical markers such as phosphorylation levels of MLC would serve as early indicators of ROCK inhibition. In parallel, electrophysiological assessments would determine improvements in nerve conduction velocity, while ultrastructural analyses via electron microscopy would be used to confirm normalization of paranodal junction integrity (Chen et al., 2013; Rayner, 2019). Given that the proper assembly of paranodal proteins like Caspr1, Contactin, and Neurofascin is essential for saltatory conduction, restoration of these complexes is the ultimate goal. The expected cascade, therefore, envisions fasudil lowering ROCK activity, reducing MLC phosphorylation, easing Schwann cell cortical tension, and thereby permitting full reassembly of the paranodal junction (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013).

Overall Evaluation
Fasudil emerges as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, based on several compelling lines of evidence.
One major strength is its well-documented clinical history. Fasudil has been approved and widely used in Japan and other regions for conditions such as cerebral vasospasm and various cardiovascular diseases; this long track record provides a robust database regarding its safety profile, pharmacokinetics, and tissue distribution (Chen et al., 2013; Dong et al., 2010). Such extensive clinical experience significantly de-risks the development process for a new indication like CMT, where the need for effective therapies is high. Moreover, the established ability of fasudil to cross physiological barriers—including the blood–nerve barrier—ensures that it reaches peripheral nerve tissues at concentrations sufficient to inhibit ROCK activity (Dong et al., 2010; Halasz & Townes-Anderson, 2016).

From a mechanistic perspective, the fundamental mode of action of fasudil—namely, its competitive inhibition of the ATP-binding site in ROCK—directly addresses the cellular and molecular aberrations implicated in CMT. By reducing the phosphorylation of MLC, fasudil decreases actomyosin contractility in Schwann cells. This reduction in cytoskeletal tension is hypothesized to permit the reassembly of paranodal junction components, including the Caspr1-Contactin-Neurofascin complex that is often disrupted in CMT. Preclinical evidence from CMT1A transgenic rat models reinforces this notion by showing improvements in internodal length and nerve conduction velocity, alongside biochemical reductions in MLC phosphorylation and ultrastructural normalization of paranodal regions (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013).

Additionally, the dual therapeutic potential of fasudil—encompassing both vascular and neuroprotective effects—is particularly attractive. While its classical use as a vasodilator stems from its action on vascular smooth muscle cells, its capacity to protect neurons and modulate cytoskeletal dynamics in both central and peripheral nerve tissues makes it a versatile agent. This duality might not only help in restoring paranodal integrity but could also promote overall axonal regeneration and remyelination, which are crucial for functional recovery in peripheral neuropathies (Chen et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2020).

However, several challenges must be taken into account in the evaluation of fasudil for CMT. One concern is its lack of absolute selectivity for ROCK2. Fasudil inhibits both ROCK1 and ROCK2; however, given that ROCK2 is believed to be predominantly responsible for the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics in neuronal and glial tissues, its non-selectivity could potentially lead to off-target effects in cell types where ROCK1 is more active. Future development may need to assess whether enhancing isoform selectivity—either by chemical modification of fasudil or by developing next-generation ROCK2 inhibitors—could yield improved efficacy and reduced adverse effects (Chen et al., 2013; Liao et al., 2007).

Another potential limitation is rooted in the fact that chronic inhibition of a kinase as central to fundamental cellular processes as ROCK might lead to unforeseen long-term consequences. Although fasudil’s clinical use in acute settings such as cerebral vasospasm demonstrates favorable short-term safety profiles, CMT is a chronic and progressive disease. Therefore, prolonged treatment with fasudil might pose risks related to sustained alterations in cytoskeletal dynamics. Detailed long-term preclinical studies will be required to evaluate the impact of chronic ROCK inhibition on myelin maintenance, nerve regeneration, and overall Schwann cell physiology (Kim et al., 2020; Olson, 2008).

Furthermore, while decreased MLC phosphorylation is a robust and easily measurable pharmacodynamic marker of ROCK inhibition, it does not capture the full spectrum of potential downstream effects. Peripheral nerve biology is complex, and the modulation of actomyosin contractility might affect not only paranodal junctions but other aspects of Schwann cell function and axonal support. As such, there is a need for comprehensive electrophysiological and ultrastructural assessments in animal models to ascertain not only the immediate biochemical effects but also the sustained functional improvements that translate into clinical benefit for CMT patients (Chen et al., 2013; Rayner, 2019).

Despite these challenges, the convergence of data from diverse experimental models—ranging from vascular and CNS applications to direct preclinical studies in CMT1A transgenic rats—strongly supports the continued investigation of fasudil as a therapeutic agent for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Its ability to restore paranodal junction integrity by modulating cytoskeletal tension in Schwann cells is directly aligned with the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CMT. In addition, the documented improvements in nerve conduction velocity and internodal length provide functional corroboration for its anticipated beneficial effects (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Rayner, 2019).

Overall, fasudil’s extensive clinical use in other indications provides a significant advantage for repurposing it for CMT. Its well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, coupled with its effective penetration into peripheral nerve tissues, offer a promising framework for clinical translation. Mechanistically, the drug’s action by competitively inhibiting ROCK—thereby reducing phosphorylation of key substrates like MLC and alleviating cytoskeletal tension—addresses the core abnormalities in paranodal architecture observed in CMT. These factors, combined with the encouraging preclinical findings in relevant animal models, make fasudil a compelling candidate for further development as a disease-modifying therapy in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

In conclusion, the synthesis, therapeutic history, and molecular mechanism of fasudil all converge to support its potential repurposing for CMT. Its chemical origins as a rationally designed ROCK inhibitor, its proven efficacy in vascular and neuroprotective contexts, and its ability to restore paranodal junction integrity through modulation of actomyosin contractility in Schwann cells collectively argue in favor of its continued evaluation in preclinical and eventually clinical studies for CMT. Nevertheless, further investigations are warranted to optimize isoform selectivity, assess long-term dosing strategies, and thoroughly characterize the functional recovery in chronic animal models of peripheral neuropathy. Should these studies yield favorable outcomes, fasudil may represent a transformative advancement for patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease who currently have very limited therapeutic options (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013; Olson, 2008; Rayner, 2019).

Overall, based on the extensive preclinical data and the robust clinical safety record, fasudil is a highly attractive candidate for repurposing in CMT. Its capacity to penetrate the blood–nerve barrier and normalize the Schwann cell cytoskeletal architecture necessary for paranodal junction assembly suggests that it might restore the functional integrity of peripheral nerves and improve conduction velocities. Given the current limitations in CMT treatment, further research into fasudil’s long-term efficacy, optimal dosing, and potential for isoform-specific improvements is highly justified. Continued investment in detailed electrophysiological, ultrastructural, and behavioral studies in animal models, followed by carefully designed phase I/II clinical trials, will determine if fasudil can ultimately fulfill its promise as a new and effective therapy for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Chen et al., 2013; Dong et al., 2010; Rayner, 2019).
