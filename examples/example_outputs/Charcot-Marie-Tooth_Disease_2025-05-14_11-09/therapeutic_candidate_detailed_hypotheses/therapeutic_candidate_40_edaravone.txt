Proposal for Edaravone (radical scavenger; Mitsubishi Tanabe research-grade)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Edaravone is a synthetic pyrazolone derivative originally developed as a free radical scavenger designed to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduce oxidative stress in neuronal tissues (Bailly, 2019, pp. 2–3). It was discovered in Japan and was subsequently approved for clinical use, primarily for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Zhou et al., 2025, pp. 1–2; Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 5–7). As a member of the antioxidant class of therapeutic compounds, edaravone exhibits a unique chemical ability to donate electrons, thereby neutralizing free radicals through its keto-enol tautomerism, which confers upon it an effective radical-scavenging mechanism (Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 7–9). Historically, compounds in this class have been deployed to reduce lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and other oxidative modifications commonly encountered during neurodegeneration (Bailly, 2019, p. 6). This compound’s synthetic origins trace back to focused research on mitigating oxidative injury in neural tissues, and its development is supported by a large body of biochemical investigation demonstrating its stability, bioavailability, and blood–brain as well as blood–nerve barrier penetration (Unknown Reference; Villar-Delfino et al., 2022, pp. 1–2).

Therapeutic History:
Edaravone has an established history of use in both clinical and preclinical settings. In Japan, it was approved in 2001 for the treatment of cerebral infarction and later for ALS, and its clinical utility has been validated through multiple randomized controlled trials demonstrating a reduction in markers of oxidative stress and improvement in neurological outcomes (Bailly, 2019, pp. 1–2; Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 12–13). Preclinical studies have extensively evidenced its neuroprotective properties in rat models of spinal cord injury (SCI) by reducing lipid peroxidation levels measured as malondialdehyde (MDA) and by enhancing motor recovery as indicated by improved motor-evoked potentials (Ishii et al., 2018, pp. 11–13; Zhou et al., 2025, pp. 15–16). Moreover, edaravone has been used in models of optic nerve injury and Parkinson’s disease, where its capability to suppress ROS formation and reduce neuronal apoptosis has been thoroughly documented (Akiyama et al., 2017, pp. 3–6; Liu et al., 2014, pp. 6–7). Although edaravone has not been directly trialed in Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease clinical studies—evidenced by the lack of registered clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov)—it has been used successfully in other neurodegenerative conditions characterized by elevated oxidative stress, thereby strengthening the rationale for its repurposing for peripheral neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Mechanism of Action:
Edaravone’s primary mechanism of action lies in its potent free radical scavenging activity whereby it directly neutralizes ROS including hydroxyl radicals, peroxyl radicals, peroxynitrite, and hydrogen peroxide through electron donation mechanisms (Duranti et al., 2024, pp. 9–10; Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 7–9). Biochemically, edaravone stabilizes cellular redox homeostasis via activation of the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway, thereby upregulating the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) (Cha & Kim, 2022, pp. 1–2; Ishii et al., 2018, pp. 25–29). Furthermore, edaravone reduces the activation of inflammatory cascades by downregulating NF-κB and associated pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which contributes to the inhibition of neuroinflammation and secondary neuronal injury processes (Bailly, 2019, p. 6; Cha & Kim, 2022, pp. 12–13). In preclinical models, treatment with edaravone has shown a reduction in oxidative stress markers such as MDA and preservation of endogenous antioxidant levels like superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH), which are essential for maintaining cellular integrity (Zhou et al., 2025, pp. 12–13; Villar-Delfino et al., 2022, pp. 6–7). The molecule’s lipophilic properties facilitate its penetration of both the blood–brain and blood–nerve barriers, ensuring that it reaches target tissues in the central as well as the peripheral nervous system (Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 9–10; Cunha-Oliveira et al., 2024, pp. 43–45). This capacity to mitigate free radical burden and prevent lipid peroxidation ultimately results in reduced apoptosis via the modulation of caspase pathways and the sustenance of mitochondrial membrane integrity (Jami et al., 2015, pp. 19–22; Cha & Kim, 2022, pp. 7–8).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis for Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease, edaravone is anticipated to prevent ROS-mediated oxidative fragmentation of septin cytoskeletal components at paranodal regions, which are critical for maintaining the integrity of nodes of Ranvier and proper nerve conduction (Zhou et al., 2025, p. 17; Andrea et al., 2024, pp. 26–27). In MFN2 and GDAP1 mutant models—genetic variants implicated in CMT—elevated ROS levels compromise mitochondrial dynamics and may indirectly destabilize the septin scaffold, leading to conduction velocity deficits (Muñoz, 2016, pp. 40–43; Miressi, 2020, pp. 272–274). Edaravone, by virtue of its potent ROS scavenging ability, is expected to reduce oxidative markers in peripheral nerves, decrease lipid peroxidation, and thereby protect the septin cytoskeleton from oxidative cleavage or disorganization (Duranti et al., 2024, p. 19; Ishii et al., 2018, pp. 29–38). This preservation of the septin-2 meshwork at nodes and paranodal regions would theoretically improve axonal conduction velocity, as evidenced by super-resolution imaging studies and electrophysiological assays in preclinical models, where improved conduction was correlated with reduced oxidative damage (Villar-Delfino et al., 2022, pp. 5–6; Zhou et al., 2025, pp. 16–17). Additionally, molecular studies have shown that septin proteins such as SEPT2, SEPT7, and SEPT11 are integral to the maintenance of Schwann cell architecture and nodal organization in the peripheral nervous system, and their protection from ROS-induced fragmentation by edaravone could preserve functional nerve conduction (Patzig et al., 2014, pp. 3–4; Roth et al., 2013, pp. 3–5). The expected effect in the proposed assay is that edaravone treatment would lead to lower levels of oxidative stress in Schwann cells, stabilization of paranodal septate junctions, and ultimately demonstration of improved conduction velocities in MFN2/GDAP1 mutant models, as measured by electrophysiological recordings (Zhou et al., 2025, pp. 9–12; Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 10–12).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, edaravone presents several strengths as a therapeutic candidate for repurposing to treat Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. Its well-established antioxidant properties and extensive clinical use in neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and acute cerebral infarction provide a strong basis for its safety and efficacy in addressing ROS-mediated neuronal damage (Bailly, 2019, pp. 1–2; Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 13–14). The mechanistic rationale underlying its ability to scavenge free radicals, activate the Nrf2/ARE pathway, and reduce neuroinflammatory processes makes it particularly attractive for protecting delicate cytoskeletal structures within the peripheral nervous system (Cha & Kim, 2022, pp. 11–12; Ishii et al., 2018, pp. 7–11). Preclinical evidence from SCI, optic nerve, and Parkinson’s disease models indicates that edaravone can reduce lipid peroxidation, preserve mitochondrial integrity, and improve functional outcomes, which are directly relevant to the pathogenic mechanisms observed in certain subtypes of CMT caused by MFN2 and GDAP1 mutations (Zhou et al., 2025, pp. 12–13; Liu et al., 2014, pp. 6–7).

Nonetheless, there are some notable weaknesses and gaps in the available evidence. First, no direct clinical trials or preclinical studies have evaluated edaravone specifically in the context of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, and the translational leap from central nervous system models to peripheral neuropathies requires further empirical support (ClinicalTrials.gov). Second, while there is significant data supporting edaravone’s ROS scavenging potential, the specific protective effects on the septin cytoskeleton or paranodal architecture have yet to be demonstrated directly in myelinating Schwann cells or in animal models that mimic MFN2/GDAP1 mutant pathology (Palau et al., 2024, pp. 12–14; Miressi, 2020, pp. 272–274). Moreover, methodologies for assessing septin integrity, such as super‐resolution microscopy at nodal regions, remain challenging and require rigorous validation to correlate structural preservation with functional improvements in nerve conduction velocity (Roth et al., 2013, pp. 5–7; Patzig et al., 2014, pp. 3–4).

Despite these gaps, the comprehensive body of evidence accumulated in the neuroscience field suggests that antioxidants like edaravone have significant potential to mitigate oxidative damage, a common denominator in many neurodegenerative processes, including those affecting the peripheral nervous system (Duranti et al., 2024, pp. 9–10; Singh & Kumar, 2019, pp. 7–8). With its demonstrated ability to cross the blood–nerve barrier and favorable pharmacokinetic profile, edaravone is positioned as an appealing candidate for rapid clinical translation, especially if further preclinical studies can validate its nodal and paranodal preservation effects in relevant CMT models (Zhou et al., 2025, p. 17; Villar-Delfino et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). The availability of existing clinical data for ALS and stroke means that safety parameters and dosing regimens are already well characterized, potentially accelerating the repurposing process for CMT (Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 9–10; Bailly, 2019, pp. 1–2).

In conclusion, edaravone exhibits a promising profile as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease based on its robust free radical scavenging properties, proven neuroprotective mechanisms, and demonstrated clinical efficacy in other neurodegenerative conditions. Its hypothesized ability to preserve the septin cytoskeletal integrity at nodes and paranodes in the peripheral nervous system by mitigating ROS-induced damage is supported by indirect evidence from other models of neuronal injury (Zhou et al., 2025, pp. 16–17; Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 12–13). However, targeted preclinical studies are essential to directly assess its effects in MFN2 and GDAP1 mutant models and to validate improvements in nerve conduction and paranodal structural integrity using high-resolution imaging methods. Thus, while the mechanistic rationale and biochemical data are encouraging, additional investigations are warranted before edaravone can be definitively recommended for use in CMT (Cha & Kim, 2022, pp. 2–4; Chahbouni et al., 2017, pp. 6–8). Overall, the strengths of edaravone—its established safety profile, potent antioxidant activity, and capacity to modulate key neuroprotective pathways—outweigh the current limitations, making it a highly promising candidate to pursue further in the context of CMT therapeutic development (Andrea et al., 2024, pp. 26–27; Ishii et al., 2018, pp. 11–13).
