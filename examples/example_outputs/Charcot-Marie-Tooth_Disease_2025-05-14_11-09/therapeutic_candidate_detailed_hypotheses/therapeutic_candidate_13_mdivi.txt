Proposal for Mdivi-1 (Drp1 inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # D2215)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Mdivi-1 is a small-molecule inhibitor originally discovered as a mitochondrial division inhibitor that targets dynamin‐related protein 1 (Drp1), a key GTPase involved in the mitochondrial fission process (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 1–3). Chemically, Mdivi-1 is a quinazolinone derivative first identified through high‐throughput screening in yeast for compounds that modulated mitochondrial morphology by inhibiting the yeast homolog Dnm1, which shares conserved functions with mammalian Drp1 (Parker, 2017, pp. 73–76). It belongs to the class of mitochondrial division inhibitors, a group of synthetic compounds widely used as research tools to manipulate the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion (Rosdah et al., 2016, pp. 1–2). Historically, Mdivi-1 has been synthesized and made commercially available (Sigma-Aldrich catalog # D2215), with its discovery driven by the notion that pharmacological modulation of mitochondrial dynamics could yield cytoprotective effects in various cellular injury models (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 1–3). As a member of this small-molecule class, Mdivi-1 has been used predominantly in preclinical studies to interrogate the role of mitochondrial morphology in cell death, neurodegeneration, and cancer, thereby validating its potential as a therapeutic tool (Koch & Traven, 2019, pp. 2–4).

Therapeutic History:
Mdivi-1 has undergone intensive preclinical evaluation in several disease models, particularly those involving neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease, where excessive mitochondrial fission is associated with pathological outcomes (Oliver & Reddy, 2019, pp. 13–15). Researchers have demonstrated that Mdivi-1 can cross the blood–brain barrier and exert neuroprotective effects in rodent models of ischemia–reperfusion injury, brain trauma, and other central nervous system insults (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 1–3; Rosdah et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). Although its original proposed mechanism involved selective inhibition of Drp1-mediated fission, subsequent studies have suggested that some of its beneficial effects might also stem from the modulation of mitochondrial complex I-dependent respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 8–11; Duan et al., 2020, p. 11). Despite its widespread application in models of neurodegeneration and even some cancer cells where dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics are implicated, there is no direct evidence in the existing literature that Mdivi-1 has been used clinically or even preclinically for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) or similar peripheral neuropathies (Whitley et al., 2019, pp. 6–7; Oliver & Reddy, 2019, pp. 13–15). That said, some recent work in related neuropathies such as hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) has hinted at the potential for targeting mitochondrial fission in peripheral nerve disorders, though CMT-specific data remain unexplored (Whitley et al., 2019, pp. 6–7).

Mechanism of Action:
Mdivi-1 was initially characterized for its ability to inhibit the GTPase activity of Drp1, thereby preventing Drp1 self-assembly into oligomeric rings or spirals that drive the mitochondrial fission process (Fischer, 2017, pp. 171–174). Biochemically, by interfering with Drp1’s ability to hydrolyze GTP, Mdivi-1 shifts the dynamic equilibrium towards mitochondrial fusion, promoting the formation of elongated, interconnected mitochondrial networks that have improved bioenergetic efficiency and reduced potential for releasing pro-apoptotic factors (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 1–3). Detailed cellular studies indicate that Mdivi-1 reduces mitochondrial fragmentation, lowers ROS production, and enhances mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP synthesis (Duan et al., 2020, p. 14; Manczak et al., 2019, pp. 11–12). In addition to direct Drp1 inhibition, several studies have reported that Mdivi-1 can inhibit mitochondrial complex I respiration in a reversible manner, which contributes to modulating the overall oxidative state of the cell (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 8–11; Rosdah et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). The compound’s mechanism includes interference not only with Drp1 enzymatic activity but also with its translocation to the mitochondrial outer membrane, possibly via effects on phosphorylation status and protein stability (Manczak et al., 2019, pp. 5–6). It is important to note that while Mdivi-1 has been extensively used as a tool compound in vitro, questions regarding its specificity toward mammalian Drp1 have been raised because notable effects on mitochondrial respiration have been observed at the same concentrations used to study fission inhibition (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 5–6; Rosdah et al., 2016, pp. 13–14).

Expected Effect:
For the proposed hypothesis in Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, the expectation is that Mdivi-1 will inhibit overactive Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission in Schwann cells and peripheral axons, thereby restoring a more balanced mitochondrial network essential for energy homeostasis and redox balance (Oliver & Reddy, 2019, pp. 13–15). In CMT, where faulty mitochondrial dynamics are thought to contribute to nodal disorganization and paranodal junction deficits, normalization of mitochondrial morphology may directly affect the localization and integrity of paranodal junction proteins such as Caspr1 and NF155 (Manczak et al., 2019, pp. 21–22). In vitro models, including Schwann cell cultures and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co-cultures, have the potential to demonstrate that Mdivi-1 corrects the abnormal mitochondrial fragmentation observed in mutant MFN2 neurons, leading to normalized mitochondrial ATP production and reduced ROS generation as assessed by JC-1 assays (Duan et al., 2020, p. 11). Improved mitochondrial structure in Schwann cells and axons would be expected to stabilize the paranodal and nodal regions, thereby enhancing nerve conduction velocities as seen in rodent models of other neurodegenerative diseases (Parker, 2017, pp. 73–76). Additionally, electron microscopy (EM) studies that evaluate ultrastructural integrity would likely show improved myelination and paranodal junction assembly following Mdivi-1 treatment (Manczak et al., 2019, pp. 19–20). Since Drp1 is expressed in both Schwann cells and neurons, its inhibition by Mdivi-1 is expected to directly modulate mitochondrial dynamics in these cell types, which is critical given the high energy demands and specialized functions of peripheral nerves (Rosdah et al., 2016, pp. 2–4; Oliver & Reddy, 2019, pp. 13–15).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of Mdivi-1 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease reveals several promising strengths alongside notable weaknesses that must be addressed in further preclinical validation. One of the major strengths is the established mechanism of action whereby Mdivi-1 inhibits Drp1’s GTPase activity, reducing excessive mitochondrial fission and thus potentially restoring mitochondrial fusion, bioenergetics, and redox balance (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 1–3; Fischer, 2017, pp. 171–174). This mechanistic rationale is particularly relevant to CMT, where mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral nerves is implicated in disease pathology, and improved mitochondrial integrity has been shown to enhance nodal domain stability and nerve conduction (Oliver & Reddy, 2019, pp. 13–15; Manczak et al., 2019, pp. 21–22). The preclinical data from diverse neurological models provide evidence that Mdivi-1 can cross the blood–brain barrier, function in neuronal cell lines, and improve mitochondrial parameters, which bodes well for its potential translation into treating peripheral neuropathies (Rosdah et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Duan et al., 2020, p. 14). Moreover, the compound’s application has been combined with improvements in mitochondrial biogenesis and electron transport chain function even though caution is warranted at higher concentrations, given the biphasic dose-dependent effects observed in various studies (Manczak et al., 2019, pp. 12–13; Parker, 2017, pp. 73–76).

However, the weaknesses include controversial issues regarding the true specificity of Mdivi-1 for mammalian Drp1, as some literature suggests that its in vivo effects may also be mediated by off-target inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, which influences respiratory function and ROS production independently of Drp1 inhibition (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 8–11; Duan et al., 2020, p. 11). This complexity may complicate interpretation of preclinical outcomes when applying Mdivi-1 to CMT models, where it will be critical to distinguish between beneficial modulation of fission and potential detrimental effects stemming from altered complex I activity. Another limitation is that, despite promising data in central nervous system models, there is a lack of direct evidence or published studies evaluating Mdivi-1 in the context of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease or other peripheral neuropathies (Whitley et al., 2019, pp. 6–7; Oliver & Reddy, 2019, pp. 13–15). This absence of CMT-specific preclinical data requires that further investigation be conducted in relevant in vitro systems—such as Schwann cell and peripheral neuron co-cultures—and in vivo CMT models to validate the proposed hypothesis. Additionally, careful dose optimization is needed because the available data indicate that while low doses (e.g., 25 μM) exhibit cytoprotective effects, higher doses (e.g., 75 μM) may lead to toxicity and increased oxidative stress (Manczak et al., 2019, pp. 13–14; Rosdah et al., 2016, pp. 13–14). In a therapeutic context, the translation of a drug candidate from central to peripheral nervous system applications may encounter pharmacokinetic differences that also need to be addressed.

In summary, Mdivi-1 represents a well-characterized small molecule that modulates mitochondrial dynamics by inhibiting Drp1-mediated fission, thereby promoting mitochondrial fusion, enhancing cellular bioenergetics, and reducing oxidative stress. These effects are mechanistically attractive for conditions like Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, where peripheral nerve dysfunction may be driven by aberrant mitochondrial fission and consequent energy deficits. The hypothesis that Mdivi-1 will improve nodal domain integrity by normalizing mitochondrial networks in both Schwann cells and axons is consistent with its observed preclinical benefits in various neurological models (Oliver & Reddy, 2019, pp. 13–15; Manczak et al., 2019, pp. 19–20). Nonetheless, several challenges remain before clinical translation can be pursued, including confirmation of its specificity in mammalian systems, demonstration of its efficacy in peripheral nerve models, and rigorous dose-ranging studies to ensure therapeutic benefits without off-target toxicities. Therefore, while Mdivi-1 is a promising candidate for repurposing in Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, additional targeted preclinical studies in appropriate CMT models—using both in vitro Schwann cell/DRG assays and in vivo rodent neuropathy models—are essential to fully validate its potential (Parker, 2017, pp. 73–76; Rosdah et al., 2016, pp. 2–4).
