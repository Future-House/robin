Proposal for Guanabenz (eIF2α phosphatase inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # G0089)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Guanabenz is a synthetic aminoguanidine derivative originally developed as an orally active α2‐adrenergic receptor agonist for treating hypertension. Chemically, it is classified among imidazoline derivatives and is commercially available (for example, via Sigma-Aldrich catalog # G0089). Its chemical structure, described as 2,6-dichlorobenzylidene aminoguanidine acetate, reflects its derivation from guanidine scaffolds used for decades in antihypertensive therapy. Over time, its pharmacology has been re‐examined following discoveries from unbiased yeast‐based screens for anti‐prion agents, which revealed that in addition to its adrenergic actions, guanabenz uniquely modulates cellular stress responses (Claes et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2023). This repositioning placed guanabenz into the class of compounds that affect proteostasis by targeting the integrated stress response (ISR) through inhibition of eIF2α phosphatase activity. The repurposing effort is grounded on its ability to modulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress—a pivotal pathogenic factor in various neurodegenerative disorders and peripheral neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease.

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Guanabenz has been used clinically as an antihypertensive agent with decades of use demonstrating a favorable human tolerability profile at established doses (Lin et al., 2023). During its time in clinical practice, its primary mode of action was attributed to agonism at α2‐adrenergic receptors, contributing to centrally mediated reductions in blood pressure. In recent years, research has shifted focus from its hemodynamic effects to its capacity to modulate cellular stress responses, particularly its interference with the eIF2α dephosphorylation process. This latter effect has been validated in multiple preclinical settings including models of prion diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) (Gornati, 2019; Lauria et al., 2021; Neuber et al., 2014; Malerba et al., 2018). Although Guanabenz has not yet reached an approved indication for treating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease specifically, several studies have explored its potential in animal models relevant to demyelinating neuropathies. For example, studies in Trembler-J mice—a commonly used CMT1A model—and MPZ mutant lines suggest improved paranodal assembly and nerve conduction velocities when Guanabenz is administered, implying a potential translational benefit for hereditary demyelinating neuropathies. Its mechanism, beyond the known central adrenergic activity, has made Guanabenz an attractive repurposing candidate for disorders where ER stress contributes to pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Stavrou et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Guanabenz acts primarily as an inhibitor of the eIF2α phosphatase complex. Under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum stress, accumulation of misfolded proteins activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) via sensors such as PERK. Activated PERK phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) at serine 51, leading to a transient inhibition of global protein translation that reduces the burden on the ER (Clayton & Popko, 2016; Gornati, 2019). Normally, eIF2α phosphorylation is reversed by a phosphatase complex composed of the catalytic subunit protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and its regulatory subunit GADD34 (also known as PPP1R15A). Guanabenz disrupts this complex by binding specifically to the regulatory subunit, thereby inhibiting its ability to recruit PP1. As a consequence, phosphorylated eIF2α remains elevated for a prolonged period, sustaining the integrated stress response (ISR) (Lauria et al., 2021; Sundaram et al., 2017; Neuber et al., 2014). This prolonged phosphorylation reduces global protein synthesis, which in turn relieves the ER load and permits more effective clearance or proper folding of misfolded proteins. Furthermore, in cellular contexts such as Schwann cells that are highly dependent on accurate protein folding for the assembly of myelin and paranodal junction proteins, this mechanism is predicted to restore the homeostasis necessary for proper membrane delivery of adhesion molecules like NF155 and other paranodal components (Gornati, 2019; Abdulkarim et al., 2017). Studies in MPZ R98C Schwann cell models have shown that treatment with Guanabenz reduces markers of the unfolded protein response (for example, reduced XBP1 splicing) and is associated with increased levels of properly processed paranodal proteins at the membrane. This effect is believed to stem from the decrease in hyperactive protein synthesis under conditions of ER stress—a state that would otherwise magnify pathology in CMT1B and similar neuropathies (Gornati, 2019; Jiang et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
In the context of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, particularly the demyelinating forms such as CMT1B, the proposed hypothesis is that Guanabenz will improve paranodal assembly in peripheral nerves by sustaining eIF2α phosphorylation and thereby reducing ER stress in Schwann cells. In normal Schwann cells, the precise assembly of paranodal junctions is critical for maintaining the nodal gaps that are required for saltatory conduction along myelinated axons. In pathological states marked by ER stress, as seen in MPZ mutation–induced CMT1B, aberrant protein synthesis and misfolding lead to insufficient production or mislocalization of key paranodal adhesion molecules. By inhibiting the GADD34-PP1 complex, Guanabenz is expected to slow the dephosphorylation of eIF2α, ultimately reducing the global translation load on the ER. This permits the cell to allocate resources toward proper folding and export of essential proteins, including those responsible for paranodal structure (Jiang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). In the assays proposed by our research team, which include detailed morphological studies of paranodal protein localization and nerve conduction assays, Guanabenz is projected to demonstrate a measurable improvement in the organization of paranodal junctions and a restoration of nodal gap integrity. This improvement should correlate with functional enhancements in nerve conduction, as previously observed in animal models where ER stress reduction resulted in better electrophysiological outcomes (Jiang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014).

Overall Evaluation:
Guanabenz presents a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease based on its mechanistic profile and preclinical evidence. One of its major strengths is the well-documented pharmacokinetic profile and the fact that it has been used in humans for decades, meaning that long-term safety data are already available, albeit in an entirely different context (Lin et al., 2023). Moreover, its mechanism of sustained eIF2α phosphorylation addresses a central pathogenic feature in demyelinating neuropathies—namely, hyperactive protein synthesis under conditions of ER stress. By reducing the ER load, Guanabenz promotes the proper folding and export of essential proteins required for the assembly of paranodal junctions in Schwann cells. Preclinical studies in MPZ mutant models and Trembler-J mice show encouraging signs regarding the normalization of nodal gaps and improvements in nerve conduction velocity, which are critical clinical endpoints for CMT (Gornati, 2019; Neuber et al., 2014).

However, potential weaknesses must also be considered. The compound’s original adrenergic activity may pose risks of hypotension and other cardiovascular effects if not carefully dosed. Indeed, clinical trial experiences in other indications such as multiple sclerosis and ALS have noted challenges with dose-related side effects, leading to dropouts in some studies (Lauria et al., 2021). In addition, while protective effects on ER stress pathways have been observed in cardiac myocytes and in neurodegenerative models, the specific effects in Schwann cells and the potential for improving paranodal assembly in CMT remain less comprehensively characterized. Some studies have raised concerns about Guanabenz in other cellular contexts, for instance, sensitizing pancreatic β cells to lipotoxic ER stress, which indicates that its effects could be cell-type specific and may not uniformly translate into benefit (Abdulkarim et al., 2017). Another potential limitation is that the long-term modulation of global protein synthesis, although beneficial under stress conditions, could inadvertently impact cellular homeostasis if the ISR becomes chronically activated. Moreover, differences in the regulatory mechanisms between central myelinating oligodendrocytes and peripheral myelinating Schwann cells necessitate additional studies to confirm that the observed molecular benefits in one system accurately forecast benefits in CMT models.

On balance, the mechanistic rationale for using Guanabenz to improve nerve conduction and paranodal assembly in CMT is robust. Its dual function—prolonging eIF2α phosphorylation to reduce ER stress and promoting the proper trafficking of paranodal adhesion molecules—directly addresses key pathological processes in mutant MPZ-induced demyelination. Combined with its known pharmacokinetic profile and established historical use, Guanabenz emerges as a strong candidate for repurposing, provided that dosing regimens can be optimized to minimize adrenergic side effects while maximizing the protective effects in Schwann cells (Gornati, 2019; Neuber et al., 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In summary, the strengths of Guanabenz include its established clinical safety record, clear mechanism of action regarding ER stress modulation, and supportive preclinical data indicating improved paranodal architecture and conduction velocity in animal models. The weaknesses center on potential off-target hemodynamic effects and the need for further targeted studies in Schwann cell models of CMT to verify that the improvements in molecular markers translate into robust functional recovery. Overall, Guanabenz is a promising therapeutic candidate for CMT that warrants further preclinical validation and eventual clinical investigation to fully determine its efficacy and safety in this patient population.
