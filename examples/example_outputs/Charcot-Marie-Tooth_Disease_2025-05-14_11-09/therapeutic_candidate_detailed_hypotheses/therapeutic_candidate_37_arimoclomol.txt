Proposal for Arimoclomol (HSF1 co-inducer; Orphazyme research grade)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Arimoclomol is a small molecule drug developed as a co-inducer of heat shock proteins (HSPs) that functions by prolonging the activation of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) under conditions of cellular stress. It is a synthetic derivative evolved from earlier compounds such as bimoclomol, with improved oral bioavailability and central nervous system (CNS) penetration. Belonging to the class of stress response modulators, arimoclomol belongs to a subgroup of compounds known as HSP co-inducers. These compounds are designed to amplify the natural heat shock response only when cells are under proteotoxic or other stress conditions, thereby minimizing adverse effects under normal circumstances. The development of this therapeutic candidate emerged from the understanding that the heat shock response is a critical endogenous mechanism to maintain protein homeostasis and that its pharmacological amplification might counter various neurodegenerative and protein misfolding disorders. Arimoclomol has been evaluated primarily for conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Niemann‐Pick type C disease, and inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD), and its favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles have made it an attractive candidate for repurposing in other disorders where proteotoxic stress is a central feature (Keppel Hesselink, 2016).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of arimoclomol is well documented in several preclinical and clinical studies in disorders characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation. In clinical settings, arimoclomol has advanced through Phase II/III trials in ALS, where it was administered at doses up to 600 mg/day and found to have an acceptable safety and tolerability profile despite the lack of statistically significant efficacy in certain trials (Benatar et al., 2018; Unknown Reference). Furthermore, its use in inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget Disease of Bone and Frontotemporal Dementia (IBMPFD) has contributed to the translational experience with the compound, providing evidence of its beneficial modulation of the heat shock response, particularly HSP70 induction. Preclinical studies in animal models of protein misfolding disorders—including models of ALS and certain myopathies—have demonstrated that arimoclomol can decrease toxic protein aggregation, delay disease progression, and improve functional outcomes through its chaperone-enhancing effects (Jerath & Shy, 2015). Although there are no registered clinical trials or direct clinical evidence of arimoclomol in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease based on searches such as “Clinical Trial Search: Arimoclomol AND Charcot-Marie-Tooth,” extensive literature examining the use of heat shock protein inducers in various neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases suggests that similar pathways are dysregulated in CMT. Notably, the mechanisms underlying certain hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies overlap with those seen in other neurodegenerative conditions where proteotoxic stress and protein misfolding play a central role (Jerath & Shy, 2015). The extensive investigational history in related protein-misfolding disorders, coupled with a well-established safety record from ALS and IBMPFD trials, positions arimoclomol as a promising repurposed candidate for further evaluation in CMT and related neuropathies.

Mechanism of Action:
Arimoclomol exerts its biological activity through the selective amplification of the heat shock response by prolonging the activation of HSF1—a master regulator of heat shock proteins. Under conditions of cellular stress, HSF1 trimerizes and binds to heat shock elements (HSEs) on the promoters of heat shock protein genes, thereby driving the transcription of molecules such as HSP70, HSP27, and others. These molecular chaperones are essential for the folding, trafficking, and stabilization of proteins that are prone to misfolding and aggregation. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases and protein misfolding disorders, elevated levels of HSP70 have been shown to ameliorate proteotoxic stress by binding misfolded proteins, aiding in their refolding or targeting them for degradation via the autophagy and proteasome pathways (Greensmith & Kalmar, 2008). The proposed mechanism for arimoclomol in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease specifically relates to its potential to restore paranodal junction integrity through multiple converging pathways. In Schwann cells, which are critical for the maintenance of myelin and proper axonal insulation in the peripheral nervous system, the folding and trafficking of key adhesion and myelin proteins such as myelin protein zero (MPZ), neurofascin 155 (NF155), and contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) are essential for the formation and maintenance of the paranodal junctions. Under conditions of proteotoxic stress related to genetic mutations in these proteins (as is the case in certain CMT subtypes), protein misfolding leads to aggregation and impaired trafficking, resulting in disrupted paranodal architecture and impaired nerve conduction. Arimoclomol, by inducing HSP70 (and possibly other chaperones) in Schwann cells, is hypothesized to enhance the correct folding of these adhesion molecules, thereby reducing their aggregation and promoting their proper trafficking to the cell surface where they contribute to the restoration of paranodal junction integrity. Preclinical data from dorsal root ganglia–Schwann cell cocultures harboring MPZ mutations have shown that treatment with heat shock response inducers reduces aggregate burden and increases cell-surface levels of molecules such as NF155 and Caspr1, as evidenced by techniques like cell-surface biotinylation assays. This biochemical modulation is expected to normalize paranodal loop structure, as seen in electron microscopy studies in rodent models of CMT1B, and improve electrophysiological parameters such as nerve conduction velocity (Keppel Hesselink, 2016; Rangaraju et al., 2008). The detailed molecular interactions involve the binding of induced HSP70 and co-chaperones to misfolded MPZ and NF155 under conditions of increased proteotoxic stress, thereby promoting their refolding and preventing aggregation. Such molecular interactions have been substantiated in various studies where enhanced chaperone responses correlate with improved cellular proteostasis in both neuronal and glial cell types (Keppel Hesselink, 2016; Jerath & Shy, 2015).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underlying the use of arimoclomol in CMT is that its amplification of the heat shock response in Schwann cells will result in the upregulation of chaperones such as HSP70 and HSP27, which in turn will enhance the proper folding, trafficking, and surface expression of paranodal adhesion molecules, including MPZ, NF155, and Caspr1. In vitro assays—in particular, dorsal root ganglia–Schwann cell cocultures derived from models with MPZ mutations—are expected to demonstrate a reduction in protein aggregate burden following arimoclomol treatment, accompanied by an increase in the mature, cell-surface form of NF155 and an improved biotinylation detection profile for Caspr1. These biochemical changes are expected to translate into ultrastructural improvements in paranodal loop structure, as documented by electron microscopy in rodent models of CMT1B, along with functional improvements observed in nerve conduction studies. In rodent models of CMT, including those harboring MPZ mutations, arimoclomol treatment is anticipated to normalize the paranodal junction morphology and increase the conduction velocity across affected peripheral nerves. Given that the heat shock response is known to be deficient in certain neuronal and glial populations under conditions of chronic stress, the ability of arimoclomol to act selectively in stressed cells means that it will exert its beneficial effects mainly where they are needed—in Schwann cells afflicted with proteotoxic stress and impaired protein homeostasis—without affecting normal cells adversely (Rangaraju et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2018). Moreover, evidence from preclinical studies in other neurodegenerative conditions demonstrates that restoration of proteostasis can lead to decreased inflammation and improved cellular survival, suggesting that additional benefits of arimoclomol may include anti-inflammatory effects and neuroprotection in the peripheral nervous system (Kaur et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, arimoclomol represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, based on its well-characterized mechanism of action, favorable safety profile in previous clinical trials, and the strong mechanistic rationale connecting HSP induction to restoration of cellular proteostasis in peripheral nerve cells (Keppel Hesselink, 2016; Greensmith & Kalmar, 2008). One of the key strengths of arimoclomol lies in its ability to selectively amplify the heat shock response only under conditions of cellular stress, thereby reducing the risk of off-target effects during normal cellular functioning. This targeted activation is especially valuable in a disease like CMT, where proteotoxic stress in Schwann cells leads to abnormal folding and trafficking of proteins critical to paranodal junction integrity. The preclinical data from related neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases, where arimoclomol has been shown to reduce protein aggregation and improve cellular function, further strengthen the case for its evaluation in CMT (Rangaraju et al., 2008; Jerath & Shy, 2015).

Furthermore, the extensive clinical experience with arimoclomol in ALS and IBMPFD—with documented safety across multiple trials—provides a solid basis for its repurposing. The fact that arimoclomol has passed significant regulatory hurdles and has already been administered in human clinical trials reduces the translational risks associated with advancing a drug candidate for additional indications. The recent data showing that heat shock response amplification can remodel paranodal junction architecture in rodent models of CMT underscores that the approach is not merely theoretical but has tangible structural and functional benefits in preclinical settings (Benatar et al., 2018).

However, there are notable challenges to consider. Although the molecular rationale is strong, there is currently a lack of direct preclinical or clinical evidence specifically demonstrating arimoclomol’s efficacy in models of CMT. The majority of existing data pertains to its use in neurodegenerative conditions such as ALS and myopathies like IBMPFD rather than in inherited peripheral neuropathies. As a result, before proceeding to larger clinical trials in CMT patients, robust preclinical studies in relevant CMT animal models and in vitro Schwann cell assays must be undertaken. These studies should include detailed investigations using dorsal root ganglia–Schwann cell coculture systems, electron microscopy assessment of paranodal structure, and electrophysiological analyses of nerve conduction. In addition, dose-response studies will be critical given that some trials in ALS have indicated potential tolerability issues at higher doses (Kaur et al., 2023; Rangaraju et al., 2008).

Another potential weakness is that the effects of HSP amplification in Schwann cells are still not completely understood, particularly with regard to the precise modulation of proteins such as MPZ, NF155, and Caspr1 under chronic stress conditions. Although there is encouraging data that increased levels of HSP70 can reduce aggregation of misfolded myelin proteins in cell culture and animal models, the complexity of Schwann cell biology and the regulation of paranodal junctions means that subtle changes in chaperone levels might have diverse downstream effects. Additionally, while arimoclomol is known to be active only under stress conditions, ensuring that it sufficiently reaches and activates the heat shock response in peripheral nerves (which are less accessible than cells in the CNS) may present formulation and delivery challenges. Finally, the extrapolation from models of ALS and IBM to CMT, while conceptually attractive, requires careful validation, as the pathogenesis of CMT involves unique genetic and cellular mechanisms that may not be completely recapitulated by models of other protein misfolding disorders (Keppel Hesselink, 2016; Jerath & Shy, 2015; Kaur et al., 2023).

In conclusion, arimoclomol presents a strong candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease based on its mechanism of amplifying the heat shock response to promote protein homeostasis, a mechanism that is critically important in mitigating proteotoxic stress in Schwann cells. Its ability to increase key chaperones such as HSP70 and HSP27 supports the hypothesis that it may restore proper folding and trafficking of paranodal adhesion molecules like MPZ, NF155, and Caspr1, thereby normalizing paranodal junction architecture and improving nerve conduction. The favorable safety profile established in multiple clinical studies in ALS and IBMPFD, along with promising preclinical evidence from models of neurodegenerative diseases, further underscores its potential. Nevertheless, before arimoclomol can be confidently advanced as a therapy for CMT, targeted preclinical investigations in appropriate CMT models and further in vitro studies using Schwann cell systems must be conducted to confirm its efficacy in restoring paranodal junction integrity and to optimize dosing parameters for peripheral nerve delivery. Overall, while there remain some gaps in direct evidence specifically for CMT, the cumulative biochemical, cellular, and clinical data support further exploration of arimoclomol as a high-feasibility candidate for treating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Keppel Hesselink, 2016; Jerath & Shy, 2015; Kaur et al., 2023).
