Proposal for Clemastine Fumarate (Biogen formulation–equivalent to Tocris catalog # 2756)

Below is a detailed evaluation report addressing clemastine fumarate as a repurposed drug candidate for Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Clemastine fumarate is a synthetic compound originally developed as a first‐generation antihistamine. Its chemical synthesis was described using an invertive N→C aryl migration strategy starting from lithiated carbamates, yielding chemosynthetically pure clemastine that is subsequently converted into its fumarate salt to boost solubility and bioavailability (Fournier et al., 2010). As a member of the ethanolamine derivative class, clemastine belongs primarily to the histamine H1 receptor antagonist class. Historically, drugs in this class have been used for symptomatic relief of allergic conditions, such as hay fever, urticaria, and other histamine-mediated conditions. The compound’s long safety track record stems from its decades‐long clinical use in allergy management (Green et al., 2017). More recently, clemastine has been repositioned as a promyelinating agent after high-throughput screenings revealed that, beyond its classical antihistaminic effects, its off-target antimuscarinic activity can enhance the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and boost remyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) (Cree et al., 2018; Green et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, clemastine fumarate was approved and widely used as an over-the-counter medication for allergic rhinitis and similar allergic conditions due to its H1 receptor antagonist properties (Green et al., 2017). In the last decade, its repurposing has been driven by preclinical work that demonstrated its ability to enhance remyelination in CNS demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) (Cree et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2023). Preclinical models including the cuprizone-induced demyelination mouse model and models of optic neuritis have demonstrated that clemastine promotes oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin repair (Li et al., 2015; Cohen & Tesar, 2017). In the context of peripheral nerve diseases, evidence is more limited; however, emerging studies in rodent models of compression neuropathy have reported that clemastine improves electrophysiologic measures and enhances the expression of myelin proteins in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (Lee et al., 2021). Notably, clinical trial registry searches for clemastine fumarate in CMT specifically have returned no direct studies, and its historical use in either Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease or other classic peripheral neuropathies has not been reported; instead, most research has focused on central remyelination (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Nonetheless, there is preclinical evidence that clemastine’s ability to promote myelin repair in CNS and PNS models might extend to conditions such as CMT where Schwann cell dysfunction and paranodal junction instability play key roles.

Mechanism of Action:
The known mechanism of action for clemastine fumarate primarily involves antagonism of the histamine H1 receptor, a property long exploited in allergy treatment (Green et al., 2017). More recently, however, researchers have attributed its promyelinating effects to off-target antimuscarinic activity; specifically, clemastine antagonizes muscarinic receptors such as the M1 subtype expressed on glial cells (Cree et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2023). In the central nervous system, this antagonism leads to an elevation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which in turn promotes the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and enhances myelin membrane wrapping (Green et al., 2017). The hypothesis for peripheral nerve application extrapolates these findings to Schwann cells—the myelinating glial cells of the PNS. Schwann cells express a variety of muscarinic receptor subtypes (for example, M1 through M4), and antagonism may similarly elevate intracellular cAMP levels, a well-established second messenger in peripheral nerve regeneration (Lee et al., 2021). The elevation in cAMP is critical because it can upregulate proteins that are essential for paranodal septate junction assembly, including cell adhesion molecules such as Neurofascin-155 (NF155) and components like Caspr1, which are critical for the integrity of the axo-glial junction at paranodal regions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a; Lee et al., 2021). In CMT, a hereditary peripheral neuropathy characterized by demyelination, such a mechanism is desirable. The proposed action—H1 receptor blockade on Schwann cells resulting in elevated intracellular cAMP—could theoretically drive the upregulation of NF155 and Caspr1, leading to enhanced paranodal septate junction assembly. Such molecular events are believed to stabilize the myelin sheath and improve nerve conduction velocity (Lee et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b).

Expected Effect:
Based on prior experience in CNS demyelination models, the anticipated effect in a CMT context is that clemastine fumarate will accelerate the assembly of paranodal septate junctions by promoting Schwann cell differentiation and boosting myelin repair. The specific expectation is that clemastine’s H1 receptor antagonism on Schwann cells will lead to a rise in intracellular cAMP, a second messenger that is pivotal in promoting the expression of myelin-associated proteins. This includes the upregulation of NF155, a glial isoform of neurofascin critical at the paranodal regions, and Caspr1 (Contactin-associated protein 1), a molecule central to the proper formation of axo-glial junctions (Lee et al., 2021). In preclinical studies with rodent models mimicking peripheral nerve injury, clemastine treatment has been linked to improved electrophysiologic parameters such as increased compound muscle action potential amplitude and decreased nerve conduction latency, which likely result from enhanced myelin thickness and paranodal junction integrity (Lee et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Moreover, studies indicate that improvement of paranodal architecture correlates with better functional outcomes in peripheral demyelinating conditions; similar improvements have been reported in rat models of compression neuropathy where clemastine increased the ratio of P0-positive (a myelin protein) axons to neurofilament-positive axons (Lee et al., 2021). Given that Schwann cells naturally express both NF155 and Caspr1, and that disruption of the paranode is a hallmark of demyelinating neuropathies like CMT, the expected molecular responses—enhanced NF155 and Caspr1 expression—could help restore proper nodal gap widths and improve conduction velocity, leading to overall functional recovery (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b; Lee et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Clemastine fumarate presents a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease based on several notable strengths but also some weaknesses that warrant careful consideration.

One major strength lies in its well-characterized safety profile and clinical experience over decades of use in allergy management, which would support rapid clinical repurposing; a favorable safety record is essential when considering treatments for chronic conditions such as CMT (Green et al., 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Its synthetic origin, documented by robust methods described in the literature (Fournier et al., 2010), assures that the formulation is chemically well-defined and can be produced reproducibly at high quality. Preclinical studies in both CNS demyelinating disorders and peripheral nerve models have provided compelling evidence of its ability to enhance remyelination, with rodent data showing improved histomorphometric and electrophysiological indicators after treatment (Cree et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2021).

Another strength is the hypothesized mechanism of action: by antagonizing H1 receptors on Schwann cells, clemastine may elevate intracellular cAMP, which is known to promote glial differentiation and myelin repair. This mechanism is supported by analogous effects observed in oligodendrocytes in CNS models, suggesting a translational potential to Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system (Lee et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2023). If clemastine can indeed upregulate NF155 and Caspr1 in Schwann cells, it will offer a novel therapeutic avenue for directly addressing the paranodal junction defects observed in CMT, which underlie many of the conduction deficits seen in these patients.

However, the candidate also has several weaknesses that must be addressed. First, despite its robust history in CNS remyelination studies, there is a notable lack of direct clinical trials or comprehensive studies in Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. Searches in clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b) have returned zero direct trials, meaning that the proposed benefit in CMT is still largely hypothetical. Second, while preclinical evidence in peripheral nerve models such as compression neuropathy is promising, these models do not perfectly mimic the genetic and biochemical complexities of CMT, particularly forms like CMT1A where dysmyelination is driven by genetic overexpression of peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) and other factors (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a; Lee et al., 2021). Moreover, the mechanistic link between H1 receptor antagonism and upregulation of specific paranodal proteins in Schwann cells remains inferential; while increased cAMP is known to favor myelination, direct evidence linking clemastine-induced cAMP elevation to NF155 and Caspr1 upregulation in Schwann cells is still emerging (Lee et al., 2021).

Another weakness is the possibility that the dosing regimens optimized for CNS remyelination may not be directly translatable to peripheral nerve disorders, where pharmacokinetic distribution and the local microenvironment may differ significantly. Although pharmacokinetic studies suggest that clemastine has peripheral nerve penetration (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a), it remains to be determined whether the effective concentration at the level of Schwann cells in human peripheral nerves can be achieved without eliciting adverse side effects, particularly given the anticholinergic properties and known sedative effects of clemastine under standard dosing regimens (Green et al., 2017; Turski et al., 2018).

In summary, clemastine fumarate is a well-known antihistamine repurposed as a remyelinating agent, with clear evidence of efficacy in CNS models and preliminary peripheral nerve models that suggest promise for treating peripheral demyelinating conditions such as CMT. Its origins as a chemically well-characterized compound with a longstanding clinical safety record strengthen its candidacy, and the hypothesized mechanism—blocking H1 receptors on Schwann cells, thereby raising cAMP and enhancing paranodal junction protein expression—is scientifically plausible based on analogous mechanisms in CNS glia. However, there is a critical gap in direct evidence: no clinical trials have yet been conducted in CMT patients, and the specific link between H1 antagonism and upregulation of NF155 and Caspr1 in Schwann cells remains to be conclusively demonstrated. These gaps necessitate further preclinical studies specifically addressing peripheral nerve regeneration and detailed mechanistic investigations using genetic or pharmacological models of CMT. Additionally, optimizing the dosing schedule for peripheral applications while minimizing adverse side effects represents another hurdle that will have to be overcome in future work (Lee et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b; Jiang et al., 2023).

Overall, while clemastine fumarate appears to be a promising candidate for repurposing in CMT due to its dual role in promoting remyelination and its known safety profile, the current literature supports further dedicated preclinical and mechanistic studies in peripheral nerve models before clinical translation. The strengths of established pharmacology, a well-defined synthesis route, and preliminary evidence of peripheral nerve activity make it worth pursuing. At the same time, the critical weaknesses – including the absence of direct clinical evidence in CMT and the need for clearer demonstration of its proposed molecular effects in Schwann cells – must be addressed by the research team through targeted experiments and pilot studies (Lee et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a; Jiang et al., 2023).

In conclusion, clemastine fumarate represents an intriguing and mechanistically plausible candidate for accelerating paranodal junction assembly via H1 receptor antagonism in Schwann cells. Its proven central remyelination effects, backed by decades of clinical use for allergy, and emerging data in peripheral nerve models provide a strong foundation for further exploration. Nonetheless, the transition from CNS to PNS applications involves significant translational challenges that need to be rigorously studied through appropriate in vivo and in vitro models of CMT to confirm whether the hypothesized upregulation of NF155 and Caspr1 can indeed translate into functional recovery in patients (Lee et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a).

This comprehensive literature evaluation ultimately supports the continuation of focused preclinical research on clemastine fumarate for CMT. The research team should design experiments that address the dosing requirements for optimal peripheral nerve penetration, validate the increase in intracellular cAMP in Schwann cells upon clemastine treatment, and quantify the changes in paranodal protein expression relative to functional outcomes. Given the drug’s established clinical profile, a successful preclinical validation could rapidly propel this candidate toward a phase II clinical trial in CMT patients, thereby significantly impacting therapeutic options for this debilitating peripheral neuropathy (Lee et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b).
