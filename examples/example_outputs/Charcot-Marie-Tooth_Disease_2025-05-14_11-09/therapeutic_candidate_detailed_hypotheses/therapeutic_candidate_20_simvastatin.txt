Proposal for Simvastatin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # S6196)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Simvastatin is a semisynthetic HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitor originally derived from fungal metabolites and later modified by chemical synthesis for greater bioavailability and potency. It belongs to the statin class of drugs, which are widely used to lower plasma low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The statins, including simvastatin, were initially discovered based on their natural origin from fungal fermentation products, and subsequent chemical modifications led to high‐efficiency inhibitors now produced on an industrial scale (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Over the past few decades, statins have become one of the most extensively prescribed classes of therapeutic agents. Their pleiotropic effects, which extend beyond cholesterol lowering to include anti‐inflammatory and neuroprotective actions, have prompted investigations into their utility in various neurological and peripheral nerve disorders (Chong et al., 2004; Holmberg et al., 2006).

Therapeutic History:
Simvastatin’s primary clinical use has been in cardiovascular medicine as a lipid‐lowering agent where it has a well‐known safety profile from decades of use, including extensive post‐marketing surveillance. Aside from its lipid‐lowering effects, numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated beneficial effects in models of neuropathic pain and nerve injury. For example, in rodent sciatic nerve crush injury models, simvastatin has been shown to display neuroprotective and anti‐inflammatory actions that preserve nerve morphology and improve functional outcomes (Corso et al., 2018; Holmberg et al., 2006). Furthermore, clinical trial investigations such as NCT02129231 have evaluated statin‐based interventions in diabetic polyneuropathy (Miranda‐Diaz, 2012), providing mechanistic insight into oxidative stress and mitochondrial function improvement in peripheral nerve disease. Although there have been no large‐scale clinical trials specifically targeting Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease with simvastatin, there exists a body of preclinical evidence and mechanistic rationale suggesting that modulation of the mevalonate pathway via simvastatin might be beneficial in conditions with peripheral nerve involvement, including hereditary neuropathies where paranodal integrity is compromised (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chong et al., 2004). In addition, studies in animal models of neuropathic pain have shown that low‐dose simvastatin can improve aspects of nerve conduction and morphology without causing overt nerve damage, further underscoring its potential repurposing for peripheral nerve disorders resembling CMT (Corso et al., 2018; Ghayour et al., 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
Simvastatin acts by reversibly inhibiting HMG‐CoA reductase, the rate‐limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, which is responsible for the synthesis of not only cholesterol but also key isoprenoid intermediates such as farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (Cartocci et al., 2016; Holmberg et al., 2006). Reduction in the production of these isoprenoids has profound downstream effects on the posttranslational prenylation of proteins, particularly small GTPases including RhoA. Prenylation – specifically geranylgeranylation – is essential for RhoA to anchor to cell membranes and mediate its signaling functions, which include regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. RhoA activity is critically implicated in the modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics in diverse cell types, including Schwann cells. In the context of peripheral nerves, Schwann cells are responsible for myelination, and they form specialized axo‐glial junctions at paranodes, where proteins such as Neurofascin 155 (NF155) on the glial side and Contactin‐associated protein 1 (Caspr1) on the axonal side form critical complexes that support saltatory conduction (Cartocci et al., 2016; Chong et al., 2004).
Simvastatin’s reduction of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate availability decreases RhoA geranylgeranylation, thereby impairing its membrane localization and leading to reduced RhoA activity. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that inhibition of RhoA prenylation correlates with enhanced neurite outgrowth and cytoskeletal remodeling favorable to axonal and neuronal reorganization (Holmberg et al., 2006; Ostrowski et al., 2016). This mechanism suggests that simvastatin may decrease the hyperactive RhoA/ROCK signaling observed in some models of peripheral nerve injury, which is known to impede proper paranodal assembly (Cartocci et al., 2016). Importantly, a balanced regulation of the mevalonate pathway appears to be critical for normal neuronal and Schwann cell function; while excessive inhibition might compromise essential functions, controlled modulation could favor remodeling and strengthen junctional integrity (Whitlon et al., 2015).
The biochemical specificity offered by simvastatin’s action on the isoprenoid branch of the mevalonate pathway – particularly affecting geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthesis – lends support to the hypothesis that by reducing RhoA activity, simvastatin might promote a cytoskeletal environment in Schwann cells that is conducive to the formation and stabilization of NF155/Caspr1 paranodal complexes, ultimately improving nerve conduction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cartocci et al., 2016).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay, simvastatin is hypothesized to improve paranodal junction integrity in models of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease by reducing isoprenoid synthesis and thereby decreasing RhoA geranylgeranylation and subsequent activity. In hereditary neuropathies such as CMT, dysregulation of cytoskeletal remodeling in Schwann cells can lead to abnormal paranodal junction assembly, with consequent disruptions in the tightly regulated structure of NF155/Caspr1 complexes. These paranodal regions are essential for maintaining high‐speed saltatory nerve conduction, and their compromise can lead to neuropathic symptoms and reduced nerve conduction velocities. Preclinical evidence from rodent sciatic nerve cultures has suggested that statin treatment increases the length and continuity of NF155/Caspr1–positive paranodes (Cartocci et al., 2016; Holmberg et al., 2006).
Given that simvastatin has been shown to modulate cytoskeletal dynamics through its effects on the prenylation of RhoA, the expected outcome in the assay would be a shift in Schwann cell morphology toward a more organized cytoskeletal structure that favors the formation and stabilization of septate‐like paranodal junctions. These cellular changes should be accompanied by improvements in electrophysiological parameters, such as increased nerve conduction velocity, as the paranodal regions become more mature and effective in isolating nodal voltage‐gated sodium channels (Corso et al., 2018; Holmberg et al., 2006).
In addition, several studies have demonstrated that simvastatin and similar statins permeate peripheral nerve tissues and exert measurable effects on nerve conduction and structural preservation in models of neuropathic pain and injury (Corso et al., 2018; Pergolizzi et al., 2020). Concomitant with a reduction in RhoA activity, one might expect a decrease in the cytoskeletal contractile forces that impede paranodal junction assembly, potentially leading to increased paranodal length and a more robust axo‐glial interface. This remodeling is hypothesized to rescue impaired nerve conduction, as the proper localization and clustering of NF155 and Caspr1 is essential for the formation of functionally competent paranodes (Cartocci et al., 2016; Holmberg et al., 2006).
In summary, in vitro assays using rodent Schwann cells and nerve explants may reveal that simvastatin treatment leads to a reduction in membrane‐bound RhoA levels, as measured by biochemical fractionation assays, coupled with a measurable increase in paranodal junction length and improved electrophysiological characteristics in nerve conduction tests. Furthermore, molecular analyses might demonstrate alterations in the expression and localization of key paranodal proteins such as NF155 and Caspr1. These findings would collectively support the hypothesis that simvastatin exerts a beneficial remodeling effect on the paranodal architecture by modulating isoprenoid‐dependent signaling pathways (Holmberg et al., 2006; Ostrowski et al., 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
Simvastatin offers several attractive attributes as a repurposed drug candidate for Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease. One of its foremost strengths is its well‐established safety profile and widespread clinical experience, which significantly reduce the risks associated with novel therapeutic agents (Chong et al., 2004; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, its mechanism of action—namely the inhibition of the mevalonate pathway leading to reduced synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates necessary for RhoA geranylgeranylation—provides a compelling biochemical rationale for modulating Schwann cell cytoskeletal dynamics. Since proper cytoskeletal organization is vital for the formation of NF155/Caspr1 paranodal complexes, simvastatin’s activity could theoretically rescue the disrupted paranodal architecture observed in hereditary neuropathies like CMT (Cartocci et al., 2016; Holmberg et al., 2006).

From a preclinical perspective, multiple studies have demonstrated that simvastatin can promote neurite outgrowth and enhance nerve repair in models of central and peripheral nervous system injury, suggesting that the drug has the capacity to modulate cytoskeletal and membrane dynamics in ways that could be beneficial for paranodal junction formation (Holmberg et al., 2006; Whitlon et al., 2015). Moreover, its ability to penetrate peripheral nerves and affect inflammatory pathways adds another layer of potential benefit, as reducing neuroinflammation may also contribute to improved nerve function and preservation of myelin integrity (Corso et al., 2018; Pergolizzi et al., 2020).

However, there are several challenges and areas of concern with using simvastatin for CMT. Despite promising preclinical models, there is a notable paucity of direct clinical evidence for simvastatin’s efficacy in treating hereditary neuropathies. The mechanisms at play in statin‐induced peripheral neuropathy, which have been reported in some epidemiological studies, must be carefully balanced against the potential therapeutic benefits, as excessive inhibition of the mevalonate pathway might adversely affect essential cellular functions in neurons and Schwann cells (Chong et al., 2004; Alsolaihim & Baker, 2020). While controlled reduction in isoprenoid synthesis could be beneficial by reducing hyperactive RhoA signaling, too great an inhibition might lead to a deficit in critical prenylation events, possibly exacerbating nerve dysfunction.
Another concern is the translation of in vitro and animal model findings into the complex pathophysiology observed in human CMT. The mechanistic hypothesis regarding the modulation of paranodal integrity via decreased RhoA activity is supported by robust biochemical data (Cartocci et al., 2016; Holmberg et al., 2006), yet the heterogeneity of CMT and its underlying genetic causes could limit the broad applicability of simvastatin as a therapeutic in this context. Moreover, while statins are known to exert anti‐inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in some models, there is also evidence of statin‐associated peripheral neuropathy in susceptible individuals, necessitating careful dosing and patient selection (Chong et al., 2004; Alsolaihim & Baker, 2020).
Nonetheless, the existing preclinical data, combined with the mechanistic insights into isoprenoid biosynthesis and RhoA prenylation, make simvastatin an attractive candidate for further investigation. Strategic design of future studies may involve dose‐ranging experiments and detailed electrophysiological evaluations in relevant animal models of CMT, as well as ex vivo analyses of paranodal junction proteins in treated versus untreated specimens. Such studies would be essential in evaluating whether simvastatin can indeed restore paranodal protein clustering (NF155 and Caspr1) and nerve conduction velocities, ultimately validating the hypothesis that modulating Schwann cell cytoskeletal dynamics via the mevalonate pathway can rescue paranodal integrity (Cartocci et al., 2016; Holmberg et al., 2006).

Overall, simvastatin’s well‐characterized pharmacology, extensive clinical experience, and promising mechanistic profile underpin its potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for targeting paranodal junction deficits in CMT. Its strengths include the mechanistic specificity afforded by modulation of RhoA prenylation, its demonstrated peripheral nerve penetration, and supportive preclinical findings in nerve injury models. The principal weaknesses lie in the current lack of direct clinical or animal model evidence specifically demonstrating improvement in paranodal junction integrity in hereditary neuropathy contexts, as well as the risk of exacerbating nerve dysfunction if isoprenoid synthesis is excessively inhibited. Thus, while simvastatin emerges as a compelling candidate to pursue further preclinical studies, a cautious approach is warranted for future translation into clinical trials for CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chong et al., 2004; Holmberg et al., 2006).

In conclusion, based on the comprehensive preclinical literature and mechanistic insights outlined above, simvastatin holds promise as a repurposed drug candidate for Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease by potentially enhancing paranodal junction integrity through the modulation of isoprenoid synthesis and RhoA prenylation. Further work is needed to optimize dosing parameters, evaluate long‐term effects on Schwann cell function and paranodal stability, and ultimately determine whether these molecular effects translate into meaningful clinical improvements for patients with hereditary neuropathies.
