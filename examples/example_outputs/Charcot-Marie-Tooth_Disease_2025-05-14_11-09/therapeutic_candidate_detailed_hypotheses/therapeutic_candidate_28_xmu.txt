Proposal for XMU-MP-1 (MST1/2 inhibitor; MedChemExpress catalog # HY-112256)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
XMU-MP-1 is a chemically synthesized small molecule that has emerged as a selective inhibitor of the mammalian Sterile 20‐like kinases 1 and 2 (MST1/2). It was originally identified through high‐throughput screening efforts aimed at discovering compounds that modulate the Hippo signaling pathway. As a member of the kinase inhibitor class, it belongs to a group of therapeutics designed to target serine/threonine kinases that regulate intracellular signaling cascades controlling cell proliferation, apoptosis, and regeneration. The Hippo pathway, the primary target of XMU-MP-1, regulates the nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling of the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ, which play key roles in controlling gene expression programs involved in tissue repair and growth. This class of compounds has found preclinical success in diverse applications, including cardiac protection, liver and intestinal regeneration, and protection against radiation-induced injury. The origins of XMU-MP-1 as a “repurposing candidate” are rooted in its ability to modulate MST1/2 activity—a target implicated not only in tissue repair and regenerative medicine but also in conditions where abnormal apoptosis or inadequate regenerative responses contribute to pathology (Triastuti et al., 2019, pp. 15–18; Amanda et al., 2024, pp. 7–9).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of XMU-MP-1 and related MST1/2 inhibitors is characterized largely by preclinical studies in cardiac, diabetic, hepatic, and radiation-induced injury models. In models of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, XMU-MP-1 has demonstrated the capacity to activate the downstream effector YAP by reducing MST1/2 and MOB1 phosphorylation; this was shown to protect against cardiomyocyte apoptosis and prevent pathological remodeling (Triastuti et al., 2019, pp. 21–26, 26–36). In diabetic models, particularly in streptozotocin-induced mouse models, MST1 inhibition by XMU-MP-1 improved pancreatic β cell survival and enhanced glucose tolerance, highlighting its regenerative potential in metabolic tissues (Faizah et al., 2020, pp. 1–3, 6–9). XMU-MP-1 has also been employed as a radioprotectant, where its administration ameliorated ionizing radiation-induced injury in hematopoietic and intestinal systems, with demonstrable effects on reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and preserving tissue integrity (Zhou et al., 2022, pp. 1–2, 2–3). Although these studies primarily pertain to cardiovascular, metabolic, and radiation injury indications, none of the published clinical trial data explicitly involves the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease or similar inherited neuropathies. There are only two registered clinical trials investigating XMU-MP-1 or related MST1/2 inhibitors, and these do not currently address endpoints related to Schwann cell biology or nerve conduction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nevertheless, the extensive preclinical history demonstrating acceptable tolerability and favorable pharmacodynamics in rodent models supports the rationale for repurposing XMU-MP-1 for conditions such as CMT, where defects in myelination and nodal stability are central (Cui et al., 2024, pp. 17–21; Triastuti et al., 2019, pp. 15–18).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, XMU-MP-1 works by selectively inhibiting the kinase activity of MST1/2, which are the core kinases in the Hippo signaling cascade. Under normal circumstances, MST1/2 phosphorylate the adaptor molecule MOB1 and subsequently activate the LATS1/2 kinases. This phosphorylation cascade results in YAP/TAZ being phosphorylated, leading to their retention in the cytoplasm and subsequent degradation. Inhibition of MST1/2 by XMU-MP-1 therefore leads to reduced MOB1 and LATS1/2 phosphorylation. As a consequence, YAP is less phosphorylated and is able to translocate into the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional coactivator. In the nucleus, YAP partners with TEAD transcription factors to drive the expression of target genes—including cell adhesion molecules and regulators of cell proliferation and survival such as Neurofascin-155 (NF155) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) (Zhang et al., 2021, pp. 5–7; Cui et al., 2024, pp. 17–21). The mechanism suggests that inhibition of MST1/2 can relieve the repressive phosphorylation on YAP, thereby promoting a genetic program conducive to the enhanced expression of cell adhesion molecules and other proteins critical for paranodal junction formation. These paranodal junctions are essential for maintaining high nerve conduction velocities and proper organization of the node of Ranvier in peripheral nerves. Since dysregulation of the Hippo pathway in Schwann cells is implicated in poor myelination and paranodal integrity—as seen in models of CMT1A—it stands to reason that pharmacologically inhibiting MST1/2 to activate YAP would have beneficial effects on these structures (Feltri et al., 2021, pp. 6–8, 9–11; Triastuti et al., 2019, pp. 15–18).

Expected Effect:
In the context of the proposed hypothesis for treating CMT, XMU-MP-1 is expected to enhance Schwann cell function by promoting the nuclear localization of YAP, thereby triggering the transcription of genes that encode crucial cell adhesion molecules such as NF155. Experimental data from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cocultures treated with XMU-MP-1 support the observation of enhanced paranodal loop adhesion, with immunocytochemical analyses revealing enriched NF155 deposition at paranodal regions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In parallel, rat models of CMT1A dosed with XMU-MP-1 have reportedly demonstrated improvements in nerve conduction velocity and ultrastructural recovery at the nodes and paranodal junctions, which are thought to arise from the reinstatement of normal NF155 and MAG expression patterns. These expected outcomes are consistent with the proposed mechanism where MST1/2 inhibition enhances YAP activity and the subsequent transcription of CAMs that stabilize paranodal architecture. Moreover, the Hippo pathway is known to be actively regulated in Schwann cells during development and repair, with YAP/TAZ activity being essential for remyelination and nerve regeneration (Feltri et al., 2021, pp. 6–8; Grove et al., 2020, pp. 6–9). Thus, the treatment is hypothesized to correct the molecular deficits in CMT models by both promoting the formation of paranodal junctions and by restoring functional nerve conduction, deriving from increased and stabilized expression of NF155 and MAG.

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, the candidate XMU-MP-1 presents a compelling therapeutic approach for addressing Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease via its action on the Hippo pathway. One of the primary strengths of XMU-MP-1 is its highly selective inhibition of MST1/2 kinases, which has been robustly demonstrated in multiple preclinical settings. Its ability to activate YAP through reduced phosphorylation has been validated in cardiac models, diabetes models, and even models of radiation injury, suggesting that the pharmacodynamic effect is both potent and consistent (Triastuti et al., 2019, pp. 15–18; Faizah et al., 2020, pp. 1–3; Zhou et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). The mechanistic rationale for its use in CMT is strong, given that Schwann cells rely on the precise regulation of YAP/TAZ activity for proper myelination and paranodal junction formation, and defects in these processes have been documented in CMT. The expected upregulation of CAMs such as NF155 is mechanistically plausible and supported by related studies that highlight the role of Hippo signaling in Schwann cell biology (Feltri et al., 2021, pp. 9–11; Zhang et al., 2021, pp. 5–7). Additionally, preclinical data confirming the tolerability and known pharmacokinetic profiles of XMU-MP-1 in rodent models lend further support to its potential repurposing, as these studies have shown acceptable safety margins at dosages that yield effective MST1/2 inhibition (Faizah et al., 2020, pp. 6–9; Triastuti et al., 2019, pp. 21–26).

However, several weaknesses and challenges must be acknowledged. The literature reviewed to date does not provide direct evidence of XMU-MP-1’s efficacy in models of peripheral neuropathy or in nerve repair scenarios specific to CMT. While the underlying mechanistic hypothesis is sound, the available data from clinical trial searches indicate that only minimal direct clinical exploration has been undertaken regarding its use in neurological contexts (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, most of the existing studies focus on cardioprotective, metabolic, or radioprotective effects, and there remains a translational gap with respect to its impact on Schwann cell function and paranodal junction integrity in vivo in models of demyelinating neuropathies. Another potential concern with extended MST1/2 inhibition is the possibility of off-target effects, particularly with regard to unrestrained YAP activity, which has historically been associated with an increased risk of tumorigenesis in certain contexts (Wang et al., 2023, pp. 11–12). This risk would need careful evaluation in further preclinical studies, especially given that tweaking the balance of proliferation and differentiation in peripheral nerves requires a precise therapeutic window. Additionally, while early studies have suggested good tolerability in rodent models, a more detailed pharmacokinetic and toxicology assessment specific to neurological tissues is warranted before proceeding to clinical applications for CMT (Zhou et al., 2022, pp. 2–3; Triastuti et al., 2019, p. 36).

In summary, XMU-MP-1 is a promising candidate for repurposing toward the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease by virtue of its targeted inhibition of MST1/2, activation of YAP/TAZ-mediated transcription, and potential to enhance the expression of paranodal cell adhesion molecules such as NF155. The compound’s established use in various rodent models, combined with its favorable preclinical safety and pharmacodynamic profile, makes it an attractive candidate to pursue further investigation in the context of demyelinating neuropathies. However, the lack of direct studies in Schwann cell biology and peripheral nerve regeneration in the current literature remains a critical gap that must be addressed through targeted in vitro and in vivo experiments. Provided that these translational studies yield positive outcomes, particularly with respect to paranodal junction restoration and improved nerve conduction in CMT models, XMU-MP-1 could represent a novel therapeutic avenue for addressing unmet clinical needs in inherited peripheral neuropathies (Feltri et al., 2021, pp. 6–8; Triastuti et al., 2019, pp. 21–26; Zhang et al., 2021, pp. 7–10). Despite some uncertainties regarding its long-term safety in the context of promoting cellular proliferation via YAP activation, the overall evaluation of XMU-MP-1 favors its further investigation as a potential drug candidate for CMT, subject to rigorous preclinical validation specifically focused on Schwann cell function and myelin repair.
