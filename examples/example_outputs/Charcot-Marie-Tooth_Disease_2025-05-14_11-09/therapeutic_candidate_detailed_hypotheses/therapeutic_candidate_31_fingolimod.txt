Proposal for Fingolimod-phosphate (FTY720-P; Cayman Chemical catalog # 11042)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fingolimod-phosphate (FTY720-P) is the active phosphorylated metabolite of fingolimod (FTY720), a synthetic analogue originally derived from fungal metabolites such as myriocin (isolated from Isaria sinclairii). Fingolimod belongs to the class of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators, compounds that bind to and modulate the function of a family of G protein–coupled receptors known as S1P receptors. These receptors regulate cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Fingolimod is synthesized through chemical modifications of a natural fungal product, and its activity relies on in vivo phosphorylation by sphingosine kinases—predominantly sphingosine kinase 2—to yield FTY720-P, which then engages various S1P receptor subtypes. This class of compounds has a long history of use in immunomodulation, particularly in multiple sclerosis (MS), where fingolimod has been widely used for its ability to sequester lymphocytes within lymphoid tissues while also demonstrating potential direct effects on central nervous system (CNS) cells (Brinkmann et al., 2010; Chun, 2011).

Therapeutic History:
Fingolimod itself was first recognized for its immunomodulatory effects in organ transplantation models before its eventual development as an oral treatment for relapsing forms of MS. Extensive clinical trials in MS patients have established safe dosage regimens, favorable pharmacokinetics, and long-term tolerability. For instance, phase 1 and phase 3 trials confirmed fingolimod’s ability to modulate immune cell trafficking with a well-characterized safety profile, as seen in large clinical programs (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2005; Chun, 2011). Although the current literature does not report its direct use in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) Disease, there is a growing body of preclinical evidence suggesting that S1P receptor modulators may have utility in peripheral neuropathies. In particular, recent preclinical work with peripheral nerve explants from models with CMT-like pathology (such as Trembler-J mice) has demonstrated that treatment with FTY720-P increases Rac1-GTP levels and enhances paranodal protein (NF155) immunostaining, pointing to a potential application in nerve repair (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chun, 2011; Juif et al., 2016).

Mechanism of Action:
FTY720-P acts primarily as an agonist at multiple S1P receptor subtypes, most notably S1P1 and S1P3, although it also binds S1P4 and S1P5. Its immunomodulatory effects are chiefly mediated via S1P1 receptor functional antagonism, wherein sustained receptor internalization and degradation lead to sequestration of lymphocytes within lymph nodes, reducing their migration to inflammatory sites. Importantly for the potential treatment of CMT, fingolimod-phosphate’s activity at the S1P3 receptor on Schwann cells has been linked to the activation of small Rho GTPases—specifically Rac1 and Cdc42. These signaling molecules are key regulators of actin cytoskeleton reorganization, which is essential for the assembly and stabilization of paranodal septate junctions. Paranodal junctions are specialized axo-glial structures that anchor Schwann cell loops to the axon and are critical for maintaining nerve conduction velocity and overall myelin sheath integrity. Experimental data, including biochemical analyses in peripheral nerve explants from Trembler-J mice (a model relevant to CMT pathology), indicate that FTY720-P treatment enhances Rac1-GTP levels and promotes the immunostaining of NF155—a glial cell adhesion molecule critical for junction assembly—and presumably Caspr1, an axonal protein required for paranode integrity. These effects are proposed to be mediated by S1P3 receptor agonism, which augments Rac1/Cdc42 signaling pathways, ultimately promoting actin remodeling necessary for the restoration and maintenance of paranodal architecture (Leo et al., 2017; Chun, 2011; Mao-Draayer et al., 2017).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis is that FTY720-P will improve the pathological features of CMT by enhancing the assembly and stabilization of paranodal septate junctions in peripheral nerves. Specifically, by agonizing S1P3 receptors on Schwann cells, FTY720-P is expected to drive the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 signaling cascades. This activation will remodel the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating the proper assembly and maintenance of paranodal structures. In turn, improved cytoskeletal dynamics should restore the localized expression of critical junction proteins such as NF155 on the glial side and Caspr1 on the axonal side, thereby repairing the disrupted axo-glial junctions typically observed in demyelinating peripheral neuropathies like CMT. Functional assays on nerve conduction, as observed in preclinical models, further support that this restoration of paranodal architecture correlates with improved nerve conduction velocities and ultrastructural reattachment of paranodal loops. The expression of S1P3 receptors on Schwann cells and the documented ability of FTY720-P to activate downstream effectors such as Rac1/Cdc42 provide a molecular rationale for these expected outcomes (Park & Im, 2017; Juif et al., 2016; Pournajaf et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Fingolimod-phosphate (FTY720-P) represents a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, based on several converging lines of evidence. One of the primary strengths of this candidate is its well-established pharmacokinetic and safety profile in MS clinical trials, which provides a robust translational advantage. The extensive clinical use and long-term tolerability data mean that the risk profile is well understood, a critical factor when considering repurposing for a new indication. Furthermore, its mechanism of regulating S1P receptor signaling is well documented, and the emerging evidence that S1P3 receptor agonism can modulate Schwann cell biology by activating Rac1/Cdc42 is highly relevant to repairing paranodal junctions—a key pathological feature in CMT. The demonstration of increased Rac1-GTP levels and enhanced NF155 immunostaining in preclinical models (e.g., Trembler-J mice) is supportive of the hypothesis that FTY720-P can restore paranodal integrity and improve nerve conduction. Additionally, the dual action of fingolimod—modulating both immune cell trafficking and potentially exerting direct effects on neural and glial cells—might offer a broader therapeutic benefit in CMT, where both inflammatory and degenerative processes may be at play.

However, there are notable weaknesses and gaps that must be addressed. Despite promising preclinical data, there is as yet no direct clinical evidence that fingolimod-phosphate improves outcomes in CMT patients. The majority of available data stems from MS trials and in vitro or animal studies focusing on CNS demyelination rather than peripheral nerve repair. In addition, while the molecular signals downstream of S1P3 activation (Rac1/Cdc42) are implicated in actin remodeling and junction assembly, the precise modulation of these pathways in Schwann cells within a diseased peripheral nerve context remains to be fully elucidated. Potential off-target effects, particularly those mediated through S1P1 or other S1P receptor subtypes, may complicate the therapeutic index when aiming for a selective enhancement of paranodal junction assembly. Furthermore, fingolimod’s known cardiovascular effects—related to its S1P3-mediated actions in cardiac tissues—necessitate careful dose titration and monitoring, especially in populations that might have comorbidities. These issues underscore the need for additional focused preclinical studies in relevant CMT models as well as early-phase clinical trials that specifically evaluate nerve function, paranodal integrity, and overall clinical benefit in CMT patients (Chun, 2011; Leo et al., 2017; Pournajaf et al., 2022; Schira-Heinen et al., 2022).
