Proposal for Saroglitazar (PPARα/γ dual agonist; Cadila Pharmaceuticals research grade)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Saroglitazar is a synthetic dual peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor (PPAR) agonist developed by Cadila Pharmaceuticals that belongs to the “glitazar” class of compounds. It was discovered and optimized for its capacity to activate both PPARα and PPARγ receptors, thereby targeting lipid and glucose metabolism concurrently. The chemical synthesis and development of saroglitazar were driven by the need for an agent that could address diabetic dyslipidemia by enhancing fatty acid β‐oxidation (via PPARα activation) and improving insulin sensitivity (via PPARγ activation) (Chhabra et al., 2022; Sharma, 2015). As a member of a class of drugs originally used to treat metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), saroglitazar’s robust action in modulating systemic lipid profiles and glycemic parameters defines its standard application in clinical practice. The unique aspect of this candidate in the proposed repurposing strategy is its potential to act on Schwann cells – the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system – to restore lipid homeostasis in myelin sheaths, a novel application beyond its conventional metabolic indications.

Therapeutic History:
Saroglitazar has been extensively studied and utilized in the management of diabetic dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and NAFLD. Multiple clinical trials and meta‐analyses have demonstrated its efficacy in significantly lowering triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, non‐HDL cholesterol, and improving other atherogenic lipid parameters, all while maintaining a favorable safety profile with minimal adverse effects such as weight gain or hepatotoxicity (Chhabra et al., 2022; Sosale et al., 2015). Its approval in India for these indications and the large body of Phase III safety data provide confidence in its bioavailability and tolerability. Importantly, searches of clinical trials databases using queries such as “Saroglitazar AND Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth Disease” indicate that there is no direct clinical trial evidence for its use in Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease or related dysmyelinating neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Similarly, there is no documented use of saroglitazar specifically for neurological disorders that affect Schwann cell function or myelin lipid composition. However, the rationale for repurposing arises from preclinical mechanistic insights into Schwann cell lipid metabolism and the role of PPARs in regulating fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis (Cermenati et al., 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
Saroglitazar functions via dual activation of PPARα and PPARγ nuclear receptors. PPARα activation drives the expression of genes involved in fatty acid uptake and β‐oxidation, thus promoting the catabolism of fatty acids and reducing circulating triglyceride levels. In contrast, PPARγ activation induces the transcription of genes that enhance insulin sensitivity, modulate adipocyte differentiation, and exert anti‐inflammatory effects. Together, the dual agonism improves lipid clearance and overall metabolic homeostasis (Chhabra et al., 2022; Sharma, 2015).

At the molecular level, emerging mechanistic studies suggest that in Schwann cells—the glial cells essential for myelin formation—PPAR pathways are critical regulators of lipid homeostasis. Evidence from preclinical studies (Cermenati et al., 2015) shows that an imbalance in fatty acid synthesis and oxidation in Schwann cells can lead to aberrant myelin lipid composition, which in turn disrupts nodal and paranodal integrity. The hypothesized repurposing of saroglitazar for CMT posits that by co-activating PPARα and PPARγ, the drug may restore the balance between fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis in Schwann cells. This dual activation would theoretically lead to upregulation of key enzymes such as phospholipase A2 group VI (PLA2G6) and UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG), both of which are crucial for the synthesis and remodeling of myelin lipids such as galactocerebroside and sulfatide (Cermenati et al., 2015; Ochoa et al., 2023).

Additional mechanistic data from related studies reveal that PPARγ activation in Schwann cells influences the expression of lipogenic genes and modulates repair phenotypes following peripheral nerve injury (Rayner et al., 2021; Meyer zu Reckendorf et al., 2020). Moreover, studies on peroxisomal function indicate that proper PPARα signaling is required to maintain fatty acid oxidation in Schwann cells, where disruptions can lead to myelin abnormalities (Yang et al., 2025). Thus, the combined effects of saroglitazar are expected to normalize the lipid milieu within Schwann cells, supporting re-establishment of proper nodal complexes and restoration of conduction velocity by ensuring appropriate anchoring of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) at paranodes.

Expected Effect:
In the context of CMT, particularly the demyelinating forms such as CMT1A, the primary pathology involves dysmyelination caused by mitochondrial and metabolic disturbances in Schwann cells. The expected effect of saroglitazar, based on its mechanism, is to restore the delicate balance of lipid oxidation and lipid biosynthesis within these cells. By activating PPARα, saroglitazar is anticipated to enhance β‐oxidation, thereby reducing accumulation of deleterious lipid intermediates that can impair myelin integrity. Simultaneously, PPARγ activation is anticipated to promote lipogenesis in a controlled fashion, ensuring that sufficient quantities of key myelin lipids such as galactocerebroside and sulfatide are synthesized. Preclinical evidence, albeit indirect, suggests that modulation of these pathways can lead to re-establishment of transverse bands and normalization of nodal gap widths as observed in electron microscopy (Cermenati et al., 2015). Functional studies in rodent models of peripheral neuropathy have demonstrated that similar dual PPAR agonists can yield dose-dependent improvements in nerve conduction velocity, implying restored nerve function (Rayner et al., 2021; Meyer zu Reckendorf et al., 2020).

Given that PLA2G6 and UGCG are implicated in the remodeling and synthesis of myelin lipids, their upregulation by saroglitazar in Schwann cells could theoretically lead to normalization of the myelin lipid composition. This, in turn, would support cell adhesion molecule anchoring at paranodes and improve nodal domain stability—a key factor for rapid saltatory conduction. Expression studies have shown that both PLA2G6 and UGCG are relevant in myelinating glia, and alterations in their function are associated with dysmyelination (Ochoa et al., 2023). The expected outcomes in the proposed assays include restoration of myelin ultrastructure as evidenced by re-formed transverse bands on electron microscopy and a measurable increase in nerve conduction velocity in electrophysiological studies, possibly in animal models of CMT.

Overall Evaluation:
Saroglitazar possesses several attractive qualities for repurposing in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. Its dual PPARα/γ agonism is well characterized in the context of metabolic disorders, and its established safety profile in Phase III studies for diabetic dyslipidemia suggests that the drug is well tolerated even with chronic use (Chhabra et al., 2022; Sosale et al., 2015). The proposed mechanism—restoration of Schwann cell lipid homeostasis through enhanced fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis—is grounded in robust biochemical evidence showing that dysregulation of these metabolic pathways contributes to myelin abnormalities (Cermenati et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2025). Furthermore, the potential to upregulate enzymes such as PLA2G6 and UGCG aligns with the need to re-establish correct myelin lipid composition, particularly levels of galactocerebroside and sulfatide, which are critical for maintaining nodal/paranodal structural integrity.

Strengths of saroglitazar include its oral bioavailability, extensive clinical use in metabolic conditions, and a mechanism that is both novel and biologically plausible for addressing CMT pathology. The dual activation strategy could simultaneously mitigate lipotoxicity in Schwann cells and promote the synthesis of essential lipid components, translating into improved myelin organization and enhanced nerve conduction. In preclinical models of peripheral neuropathy—not specifically CMT but related to Schwann cell dysfunction—the modulation of PPAR signaling has been shown to exert beneficial effects on nerve repair and regeneration (Rayner et al., 2021; Meyer zu Reckendorf et al., 2020).

However, there are notable weaknesses and gaps in the current evidence. To date, there is no direct preclinical or clinical data evaluating saroglitazar in CMT or other dysmyelinating neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The proposed mechanism, although compelling, is extrapolated from studies in metabolic and general peripheral nerve injury models rather than specific genetic or animal models of CMT. In addition, while the drug’s metabolic benefits are clear, the precise downstream effects on myelin lipid composition—specifically the regulation of PLA2G6 and UGCG—have not been directly demonstrated in Schwann cell models. There is a critical need for targeted in vitro and in vivo studies to assess its effects on Schwann cell function, myelin ultrastructure, and conduction velocity in established CMT models. The variability in lipid metabolism between murine and human Schwann cells, as noted in the literature (Meyer zu Reckendorf et al., 2020), also raises questions regarding the translation of preclinical findings to human patients.

Overall, the proposed repurposing of saroglitazar for CMT is scientifically promising but remains speculative without direct experimental validation in relevant models. The drug’s strong safety record and favorable pharmacokinetic properties in its approved indications lend support to its further investigation. Given the novel lipid-centric mechanism proposed for restoring nodal domain stability by rebalancing fatty acid oxidation and myelin lipid biosynthesis, saroglitazar warrants preclinical trials using CMT-specific cellular and animal models before any clinical application can be contemplated. In summary, while there are clear strengths in terms of safety, bioavailability, and a mechanistically plausible mode of action, the lack of direct evidence in neuropathic models remains the primary weakness. Future studies should focus on detailed molecular and electrophysiological assessments in CMT models to validate the ability of saroglitazar to modulate PLA2G6 and UGCG expression and improve nodal/paranodal architecture, thereby establishing its therapeutic potential for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (Cermenati et al., 2015; Rayner et al., 2021; Chhabra et al., 2022).
