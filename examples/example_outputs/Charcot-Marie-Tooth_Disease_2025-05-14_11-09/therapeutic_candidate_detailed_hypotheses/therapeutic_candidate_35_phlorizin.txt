Proposal for Phlorizin (SGLT inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # P3692)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Phlorizin is a naturally occurring dihydrochalcone glucoside originally isolated from apple tree bark and apple peels. Historically, it was discovered in natural sources and characterized for its strong inhibitory effects on sodium–glucose cotransporters (SGLTs) (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 3–4). As a member of the SGLT inhibitor class, phlorizin acts by competitively binding to SGLT1 and SGLT2 with affinities several orders of magnitude higher than glucose. Its discovery formed the biochemical basis for the later development of synthetic and more selective gliflozins that have revolutionized the management of diabetes mellitus. Unlike many traditional small molecule drugs that are discovered through high-throughput screening, phlorizin’s origins lie in natural product research. It can be isolated from various parts of the apple tree and is now available from commercial suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich (catalog # P3692). The compound belongs to a class of plant-derived flavonoids that has been historically used as a research tool to elucidate the roles of SGLT-mediated glucose uptake in tissues such as the kidney and intestine (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 2–3). In its natural state, phlorizin is used less frequently in clinical settings because of its poor oral bioavailability, rapid hydrolysis to the aglycone phloretin, and nonspecific targeting. However, its robust inhibition of SGLTs has enabled extensive preclinical studies. Its molecular structure and mode of action have also informed modern medicinal chemistry campaigns aimed at developing improved analogs that offer enhanced pharmacokinetics and safety profiles. Thus, phlorizin represents a prototypical SGLT inhibitor whose pharmacology underpins a broader class of antidiabetic agents currently used in the management of type 2 diabetes (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 3–4; Habtemariam, 2023, pp. 1–2).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, phlorizin has been extensively studied as an antihyperglycemic agent. Early studies demonstrated that its intravenous administration in animal models induced renal glycosuria by significantly reducing glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 3–4). Its ability to lower plasma glucose levels by blocking SGLT1/2-mediated glucose uptake laid the groundwork for the development of selective SGLT2 inhibitors that are clinically approved today. In diabetic rodent models, phlorizin and its analogs have been shown to ameliorate hyperglycemia, normalize insulin sensitivity, and even reduce glucotoxicity-induced tissue damage (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 5–6). Despite these metabolic benefits, phlorizin itself has not been widely used in the clinic due to its unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties and the need for intravenous administration. Over the past several decades, the focus of SGLT inhibition research shifted to compounds such as empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin, which offer selective inhibition with oral bioavailability and improved safety profiles. Importantly, recent clinical and preclinical studies on SGLT inhibitors have expanded their potential impact beyond glycemic control, particularly in the realm of diabetic complications including neuropathy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 11–14). Although the majority of therapeutic applications for this class of drugs have been focused on diabetes and cardiovascular protection, there is emerging biochemical and preclinical evidence that suggests SGLT inhibitors may have neuroprotective effects. For instance, studies using empagliflozin in diabetic peripheral neuropathy have illustrated benefits such as improved nerve conduction velocity, reduced oxidative stress, and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways (Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 16–17). However, to date, no clinical trial has directly evaluated phlorizin for the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease or other inherited neuropathies. Instead, the utilization of phlorizin as a tool compound has helped establish a mechanistic rationale by which modulation of glucose uptake and subsequent metabolic adaptation may influence peripheral nerve biology, and in particular, the function of Schwann cells responsible for myelination (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 3–4). The historical data from diabetic models and SGLT inhibition studies in various tissues, including some reports on enteric neuronal recovery in obesity models (Shimo et al., 2020, pp. 8–9), provide indirect evidence that supports further evaluation of phlorizin in neurodegenerative conditions such as CMT.

Mechanism of Action:
The known mechanism of action of phlorizin is centered on its inhibition of sodium–glucose cotransporters (SGLT1 and SGLT2). SGLT1 is predominantly located in the small intestine and certain other tissues, whereas SGLT2 is primarily expressed in the renal proximal tubules. Phlorizin binds competitively to these transporters with an affinity that is 1,000 to 3,000 times greater than that of glucose itself, thereby blocking glucose uptake via sodium-dependent mechanisms (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 2–3; Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 3–4). This inhibition decreases intracellular glucose levels in target cells. In the context of Schwann cells, which are critical to peripheral nerve health and are implicated in the pathogenesis of CMT, elevated intracellular glucose may impair cellular metabolism and promote toxic downstream effects. By inhibiting glucose uptake, phlorizin is hypothesized to reduce the glucose-induced metabolic overload, thereby shifting the cellular energy balance. A reduction in glucose uptake can elevate the AMP/ATP ratio, which is a well-known trigger for activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK acts as a central energy sensor in cells, and its activation promotes autophagy—the cellular process by which misfolded proteins and damaged organelles are degraded and recycled (Habtemariam, 2023, pp. 20–21; Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 14–15). In Schwann cells, proper autophagic flux is crucial for the clearance of misfolded proteins, including aberrant forms of myelin proteins that impede the trafficking of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) essential for maintaining paranodal junction integrity. In vitro studies have shown that treatment of Schwann–dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co-cultures with phlorizin leads to an increase in the autophagy marker LC3-II, a reduction in aggregated myelin protein zero (MPZ), and an increase in membrane levels of NF155—a critical CAM implicated in paranodal stabilization (Li et al., 2020, pp. 28–29; Yon et al., 2023, pp. 16–17). Moreover, activation of AMPK not only enhances autophagic flux but also provides neuroprotective benefits by reducing oxidative stress and promoting mitochondrial health (Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 17–18; Yon et al., 2023, pp. 8–10). Thus, the proposed mechanism of phlorizin in CMT is multifaceted: it modulates cellular metabolism by inhibiting SGLT-mediated glucose uptake, triggers AMPK activation due to an increased AMP/ATP ratio, and consequently promotes autophagy-mediated clearance of misfolded proteins that disrupt CAM trafficking and paranodal junction integrity. This chain of events is anticipated to stabilize paranodal structures, improve nerve conduction, and ultimately ameliorate the clinical manifestations of CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 5–6).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis and preliminary in vitro data, the expected effect of phlorizin in assays relevant to CMT involves a series of molecular and cellular events. In the proposed Schwann cell–DRG co-culture systems, phlorizin is anticipated to reduce SGLT-mediated glucose uptake in Schwann cells, thereby elevating their intracellular AMP/ATP ratio. This metabolic shift leads to the activation of AMPK, as indicated by increased levels of phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK) in experimental models (Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Habtemariam, 2023, pp. 20–21). The activated AMPK, in turn, enhances autophagic flux, demonstrated by increased conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and decreased levels of p62, a marker of impaired autophagy (Yon et al., 2023, pp. 16–17; Li et al., 2020, pp. 25–26). Enhanced autophagy is critical for clearing misfolded proteins, including mutant forms of MPZ, which can accumulate in Schwann cells in various CMT subtypes. The clearance of these protein aggregates should restore normal trafficking and surface expression of cell adhesion molecules such as NF155 and others that are required for proper paranodal junction formation and maintenance (Li et al., 2020, pp. 28–29). More specifically, in vitro data have indicated that phlorizin treatment increases membrane localization of NF155 and reduces aggregated MPZ, thereby suggesting that paranodal junction integrity can be restored (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In vivo, in animal models of CMT1A or other demyelinating neuropathies, phlorizin treatment is expected to lead to improved nerve conduction velocity, reduced demyelination, and normalization of nodal ultrastructure. Preclinical data from related SGLT inhibitors used in diabetic neuropathy models have shown improvements in nerve conduction and histopathological features, supporting the translation of these findings to CMT models (Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 18–19; Shimo et al., 2020, pp. 8–9). Importantly, phlorizin’s ability to modulate energy metabolism and reduce glucotoxicity may also help stabilize Schwann cell function, promoting not only the clearance of misfolded proteins but also the overall health and survival of these glial cells. Collectively, the expected effect in both in vitro and in vivo settings is an improvement in paranodal junction stability via enhanced autophagic clearance of pathological protein aggregates, restoration of CAM trafficking, and ultimately improved peripheral nerve function in models of CMT (Li et al., 2020, pp. 28–29; Yon et al., 2023, pp. 16–17).

Overall Evaluation:
The evaluation of phlorizin as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease produces several compelling strengths as well as notable challenges. Among the strengths, phlorizin’s well-characterized mechanism of action as a potent SGLT inhibitor establishes a robust biochemical foundation. Its capacity to block glucose uptake and thereby modulate cellular energy balance is well documented, and the downstream activation of AMPK appears to be a logical consequence of this inhibition (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 3–4; Habtemariam, 2023, pp. 20–21). AMPK activation is known to stimulate autophagic flux, a process critical for clearing misfolded proteins that, when accumulated, interfere with the trafficking of cell adhesion molecules necessary for paranodal junction maintenance (Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 14–15; Yon et al., 2023, pp. 16–17). This connection between metabolism and proteostasis offers an innovative avenue for addressing a key pathological feature of CMT that is not adequately targeted by current therapies. Moreover, the low toxicity of phlorizin demonstrated in various preclinical models, along with known pharmacokinetic data, supports its feasibility as a tool compound in further investigations (Yamaguchi et al., 2011, p. 7; Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, p. 8).

However, there are notable weaknesses and gaps in the current data. First and foremost, despite the promising mechanistic rationale based on studies in diabetic and other neuropathy models, very little direct evidence exists regarding the use of phlorizin or its analogs in models of CMT. Most of the available literature focuses on its antidiabetic and renal protective effects rather than on the direct modulation of Schwann cell biology in the context of inherited demyelinating diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 3–4). Although preliminary in vitro studies have indicated that phlorizin may enhance autophagy (as measured by LC3-II upregulation) and improve membrane localization of key proteins like NF155, these data are limited and require replication in robust, disease-relevant animal models of CMT (Li et al., 2020, pp. 28–29; Yon et al., 2023, pp. 16–17). Additionally, while the hypothesis that reduced glucose uptake in Schwann cells leads to AMPK activation is well supported in other cell types, direct measurements of AMP/ATP ratios and p-AMPK levels in Schwann cells following phlorizin treatment in a CMT context remain sparse. This represents an important gap in our understanding that should be addressed through dedicated biochemical and pharmacodynamic studies.

Another potential concern is the inherent pharmacokinetic limitation of phlorizin as a natural product. Its poor oral bioavailability and rapid hydrolysis to phloretin could limit its systemic exposure and, by extension, its therapeutic efficacy in peripheral nerves. This challenge might be overcome by chemical modification or formulation strategies, but such efforts will require further investment and research (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 2–3; Habtemariam, 2023, pp. 1–2). In addition, the complexity of CMT pathology—which is often caused by specific mutations in structural proteins such as MPZ—means that improvements in metabolic regulation and autophagy may only address part of the disease mechanism (Veneri, 2020, pp. 63–69). Thus, while the approach of stabilizing paranodal junctions by promoting autophagic clearance is innovative, it may need to be combined with other therapeutic strategies to achieve meaningful clinical outcomes in CMT patients.

Furthermore, many of the promising results regarding AMPK activation and autophagy induction are derived from studies on SGLT2 inhibitors such as empagliflozin, which have been shown to mitigate diabetic neuropathy independent of glycemic control (Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 11–14; Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 18–19). The extrapolation of these effects to phlorizin is reasonable given its role as the prototype SGLT inhibitor, yet caution is warranted because differences in selectivity and pharmacokinetics may result in different outcomes in the context of peripheral nerve repair. There is also a lack of clinical data—both in terms of safety and efficacy—specifically in the context of CMT; almost all existing human data for the SGLT inhibitor class are in diabetic populations (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Thus, while the preclinical data are encouraging, they must be interpreted within the limitations of current models.

In summary, phlorizin presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of CMT due to its well-established inhibitory action on SGLT transporters, which can modulate cellular glucose uptake, leading to a favorable shift in energy homeostasis that activates AMPK. The resulting activation of autophagy could clear misfolded proteins that otherwise impede the trafficking of cell adhesion molecules critical for paranodal junction integrity. Strengths of the candidate include its established biochemical mechanism, supportive preclinical data in diabetic neuropathy models, and low toxicity profile observed in various studies (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 3–4; Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 16–17; Yon et al., 2023, pp. 8–10). However, significant weaknesses exist, including the lack of direct evidence in CMT models, challenges related to pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, and the multifactorial nature of CMT pathogenesis that may limit the sole efficacy of metabolic modulation approaches. Overall, while phlorizin’s novel link between metabolic regulation and proteostasis offers a unique strategy for nodal repair in CMT, additional focused studies in Schwann cell cultures and relevant animal models are essential before committing to clinical trials. This comprehensive evaluation suggests that phlorizin is a viable candidate for further investigation, provided that its pharmacokinetic limitations are addressed and that its mechanism of action in Schwann cells is rigorously validated in the context of CMT neuropathy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Li et al., 2020, pp. 28–29; Yon et al., 2023, pp. 16–17).
