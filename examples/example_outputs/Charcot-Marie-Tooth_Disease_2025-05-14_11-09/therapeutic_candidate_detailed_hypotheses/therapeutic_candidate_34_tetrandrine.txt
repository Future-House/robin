Proposal for Tetrandrine (calcium channel blocker; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # T0550)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tetrandrine is a bis‐benzylisoquinoline alkaloid originally isolated from the dried roots of Stephania tetrandra. As a naturally derived compound, it was discovered through traditional medicine research and later characterized chemically and pharmacologically. Tetrandrine belongs to the class of calcium channel blockers that also exhibit BK channel modulation properties. Historically, this compound has been investigated for its anti‐inflammatory, anti‐fibrotic, and immunosuppressive activities, as well as its potential in treating hypertension, certain cancers, and silicosis (Nardi & Olesen, 2008). Its chemical structure and multi‐target profile allow it to modulate ion channels and associated intracellular signaling pathways. This class of compounds is generally known for their ability to inhibit Ca²⁺ entry, thereby affecting cellular processes that are sensitive to intracellular calcium fluctuations. Consequently, tetrandrine’s pharmacological profile makes it an attractive candidate for repurposing by targeting Ca²⁺‐dependent pathologies, including those where aberrant calcium handling triggers downstream proteolytic cascades.

Therapeutic History:
Tetrandrine’s therapeutic history is notable in both preclinical and limited clinical settings—primarily in the areas of oncology, cardiovascular disease, and inflammatory conditions. A number of studies have investigated its role as an anti‐fibrotic agent and calcium channel modulator. However, when it comes to neurological disorders, particularly peripheral demyelinating conditions such as Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease, the literature is notably sparse. A direct search of the ClinicalTrials.gov database using terms that combine tetrandrine with “Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth,” “demyelinating neuropathy,” “nerve conduction,” or “Schwann cell” yields zero registered clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Das, 2016). Similarly, classic preclinical studies or published animal data linking tetrandrine to improved nodal or paranodal function in CMT models are not present in the available literature (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Das, 2016). In essence, while the therapeutic class of calcium channel blockers has been extensively explored in various clinical contexts, tetrandrine itself has not been evaluated in clinical or widely recognized preclinical studies specifically targeting the pathological mechanisms of CMT or analogous demyelinating neuropathies. Thus, its use for CMT remains a novel hypothesis rather than one backed by an established historical record.

Mechanism of Action:
Tetrandrine’s known mechanism of action revolves around its ability to block L‐type calcium channels, thereby reducing the influx of Ca²⁺ into cells. This action has been documented by studies employing techniques such as fura‐2 imaging to demonstrate reduced calcium uptake in cellular models (Nardi & Olesen, 2008). In many cell types, including cells with excitable membranes, the reduced Ca²⁺ entry can dampen downstream activation of several calcium‐dependent processes. One of these key downstream effectors is calpain, a calcium‐dependent cysteine protease which, when activated, leads to proteolysis of critical intracellular and membrane‐associated proteins. In the context of Schwann cells, which are responsible for the formation and maintenance of myelin in the peripheral nervous system, elevated intracellular Ca²⁺ under stress or injury conditions has been implicated in the activation of calpain. Calpain, in turn, degrades components of the paranodal septate junction complex—specifically adhesion molecules such as Neurofascin 155 (NF155), Caspr1, and Contactin‐1—which are essential for maintaining the structure and function of nodes of Ranvier (Pan & Chan, 2017). The proposed hypothesis is that by blocking L‐type calcium channels, tetrandrine would reduce intracellular Ca²⁺ levels in Schwann cells, thereby preventing calpain activation and subsequent degradation of these critical adhesion complexes. This mechanism is supported by general literature on Ca²⁺‐dependent calpain activation and the resulting disruption of paranodal architecture; however, it is important to note that there is no direct biochemical evidence in the current context that demonstrates tetrandrine’s effect on these specific proteins in CMT models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Pan & Chan, 2017).

At the molecular level, calcium channel blockers modulate transmembrane ion currents by interfering with the opening of voltage‐gated calcium channels. In a stressed or injured Schwann cell, voltage‐gated calcium channels are activated, leading to an influx of Ca²⁺ ions. This increased Ca²⁺ concentration can trigger calpain activation—a process that affects not only cytoskeletal elements but also membrane‐associated proteins critical to the paranode integrity. The preservation of the paranodal junctions is crucial since these structures underpin the maintenance of proper axonal conduction by ensuring the proper segregation of sodium and potassium channels along the axon (Das, 2016; Moss et al., 2021). In this light, tetrandrine’s biochemical activity as a calcium channel blocker may indirectly contribute to the preservation of paranodal complexes. Although the existing literature on calcium influx in demyelinating neuropathies underscores the role of calpain‐mediated degradation, empirical evidence demonstrating that tetrandrine specifically inhibits calpain‐induced cleavage of NF155, Caspr1, or Contactin‐1 in Schwann cells or in PMP22 rodent models is not available in the current body of evidence (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Das, 2016).

Expected Effect:
Under the proposed hypothesis, tetrandrine is expected to exert a neuroprotective effect on peripheral nerve fibers in CMT by enhancing paranodal septate junction formation. Specifically, the expected cascade of events is as follows: In stressed Schwann cells (which are documented to play a pivotal role in maintaining axonal integrity and nodal architecture in demyelinating neuropathies such as CMT), elevated intracellular calcium triggers calpain activation, leading to proteolysis of key junctional proteins (Moss et al., 2021; Pan & Chan, 2017). By reducing Ca²⁺ influx via blockade of L‐type calcium channels, tetrandrine is hypothesized to prevent the activation of calpain. This should result in decreased cleavage of CAMs (cell adhesion molecules) involved in the paranodal complex, including NF155, Caspr1, and Contactin‐1. Such preservation of the paranodal architecture is critical because these proteins are responsible for anchoring the myelin sheath to the axon and for maintaining the high fidelity of saltatory conduction—which is compromised in CMT (Das, 2016; Pan & Chan, 2017).

In vitro assays using PMP22‐overexpressing Schwann cell cultures are anticipated to show that treatment with tetrandrine results in increased paranodal immunostaining, indicating a preserved or enhanced paranodal junction formation. Enhanced immunostaining of markers such as NF155, Caspr1, and Contactin‐1 would correlate with improved nodal architecture, which is essential for maintaining conduction velocity and overall nerve function. Furthermore, animal models of CMT might demonstrate a restoration of nerve conduction velocity upon tetrandrine treatment, aligning with the hypothesis that inhibiting calcium influx and subsequent calpain activation will protect or restore paranodal function (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Das, 2016). It should be emphasized, however, that although there is a solid theoretical basis derived from general studies on calcium dysregulation in demyelinating conditions (Pan & Chan, 2017), direct experimental data on tetrandrine’s efficacy in these specific cellular or animal models remains absent from the literature as currently available.

Overall Evaluation:
Evaluating tetrandrine as a repurposed candidate for the treatment of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth Disease involves balancing theoretical promise with the current gaps in direct experimental evidence. On the positive side, the compound’s mechanism—as a calcium channel blocker that potentially reduces calpain‐mediated proteolysis—addresses a mechanistically plausible target in CMT pathology. Since dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and subsequent calpain activation have both been implicated in the degradation of paranodal junction proteins, tetrandrine’s ability to mitigate these processes could offer a novel therapeutic avenue (Pan & Chan, 2017; Nardi & Olesen, 2008). The distinct mechanism of action of tetrandrine, when compared to more traditional sodium channel blockers that have been evaluated for neuroprotection in demyelinating diseases (O’Malley, 2009), provides an alternative strategy by targeting a different node of the pathophysiological cascade.

However, several weaknesses must also be considered. The literature searches show that no registered clinical trials or clear preclinical studies have evaluated tetrandrine in the context of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease, demyelinating neuropathies, or even broad‐assessment of nerve conduction in relation to Schwann cell function (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, while the theoretical mechanism—reduction of Ca²⁺ influx leading to decreased calpain activation—is compelling, direct evidence demonstrating that tetrandrine can specifically prevent the proteolytic degradation of proteins such as NF155, Caspr1, or Contactin‐1 in relevant cell types is lacking (Das, 2016; Pan & Chan, 2017). Additionally, the non‐neurological therapeutic history of tetrandrine suggests that its pharmacokinetics, off‐target effects, and general toxicity have been evaluated in other disease contexts but not thoroughly in peripheral nerve models or in chronic applications required for a slowly progressive disease such as CMT.

Given the absence of direct experimental studies—either in PMP22‐overexpressing Schwann cell cultures or in animal models of CMT—the current evidence base supports only a hypothesis. The proposed preclinical studies are therefore critical: Detailed in vitro analyses using Schwann cell cultures and subsequent in vivo studies with established CMT rodent models are necessary to validate the putative mechanism. Comprehensive studies should include fura‐2 imaging to confirm reductions in intracellular Ca²⁺, concomitant measurements of calpain activity, and immunoassays to quantify paranodal protein levels before and after treatment with tetrandrine (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Das, 2016).

In summary, while tetrandrine is a promising therapeutic candidate based on its known role as a calcium channel blocker and its potential to prevent calpain‐mediated degradation of paranodal junction proteins, the candidate’s application in Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth Disease has not yet been directly supported by preclinical or clinical studies. Its strengths lie in the innovative mechanism that targets calcium‐dependent proteolysis—a process well established in demyelinating neuropathies—whereas its weaknesses revolve around the lack of direct empirical evidence in CMT models and the uncertainty regarding its long‐term safety and efficacy in a neurological setting. The future direction should include rigorous in vitro and in vivo evaluations to determine whether the theoretical benefits of tetrandrine translate into meaningful therapeutic outcomes for CMT patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Nardi & Olesen, 2008; Pan & Chan, 2017; Das, 2016; Moss et al., 2021).

Overall, the scientific rationale for repurposing tetrandrine in CMT is compelling from a mechanistic standpoint, yet the significant gap in direct preclinical data necessitates a cautious approach. It is recommended that the drug development team prioritize detailed preclinical investigations to establish pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles in neural tissues, along with safety assessments in relevant models, before progressing to clinical evaluation in patients with Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth Disease.
