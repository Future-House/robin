Proposal for Pevonedistat (MLN4924; Cayman Chemical catalog # 20701)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pevonedistat (also known as MLN4924 and sold under Cayman Chemical catalog #20701) is a fully synthetic, small‐molecule inhibitor that belongs to the class of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitors. This compound was identified through extensive high‐throughput screening efforts aimed at targeting the neddylation pathway—a key regulatory cascade that controls the activity of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) involved in protein degradation—and was subsequently optimized chemically for potency and selectivity (Bhatia et al., 2016). As a member of the NAE inhibitor class, Pevonedistat possesses a unique mechanism of action that differentiates it from more classically employed proteasome inhibitors; whereas traditional agents such as bortezomib broadly affect the ubiquitin–proteasome system, NAE inhibitors like Pevonedistat specifically block the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like molecule NEDD8 to target proteins, particularly the cullins, thereby indirectly modulating protein turnover (Bhatia et al., 2016). Its chemical synthesis and subsequent formulation have been optimized for systemic administration, with early studies employing intravenous dosing in oncology settings, and the compound has been rigorously characterized from a medicinal chemistry standpoint (Bhatia et al., 2016). The fact that Pevonedistat is a synthetic molecule also allows for precise control over its chemical structure, which is essential for achieving selective inhibition of NAE while reducing off-target effects that could compromise safety (Bhatia et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Pevonedistat has been explored extensively in the oncology arena, where its ability to inhibit the neddylation pathway has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest, DNA re‐replication stress, apoptosis, and even autophagy in several tumor cell types (Bhatia et al., 2016). Preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma, and various lymphomas, and it has also been tested in solid tumors such as metastatic melanoma and nonhematologic cancers; indeed, early clinical trials such as those identified by NCT00677170 and NCT01415765 have focused on dose-escalation and safety assessments with promising signs of target engagement and antitumor activity (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 2008; National Cancer Institute, 2011). In these studies, patients received Pevonedistat on defined dosing schedules, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were well characterized; plasma profiling revealed dose-proportional exposure and a relatively short elimination half-life, while pharmacodynamic biomarkers (including increases in CDT-1 and NRF-2 transcripts) confirmed inhibition of NAE signaling (Bhatia et al., 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Despite its extensive evaluation in oncology, there is no documented history of its use in treating Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) or similar peripheral neuropathies; indeed, the majority of clinical data involving Pevonedistat has been generated from studies in cancer patients, with no direct clinical evidence supporting its use in neuropathic or demyelinating conditions (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 2008; National Cancer Institute, 2011). Nevertheless, preclinical investigations into the role of neddylation in Schwann cell biology, particularly those by Ayuso-García et al., have highlighted that inhibition of neddylation can severely compromise Schwann cell differentiation and myelination, thereby underscoring the need for careful evaluation of dosing and context when repurposing an agent like Pevonedistat for neuropathy (Ayuso-García et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
Pevonedistat exerts its biological effects by selectively inhibiting the NEDD8-activating enzyme, a critical enzyme required for the initiation of the neddylation process. In normal cellular physiology, NAE catalyzes the activation of NEDD8 by forming a high-energy NEDD8-AMP intermediate, which is then transferred to a series of E2 conjugating enzymes before being ligated, via E3 ligases, onto substrate proteins such as the cullins. Cullin neddylation is essential for the assembly and activity of CRL complexes, which mediate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of various short-lived regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal dynamics (Shah et al., 2016). By preventing the conjugation of NEDD8 to cullins, Pevonedistat causes the inactivation of CRL complexes, resulting in the accumulation of their substrates. Among these substrates are several proteins that regulate the turnover of Rho GTPase regulators and components of the endocytic machinery; these proteins are critical for actin cytoskeleton remodeling and the trafficking of membrane proteins, including those required for the maintenance of paranodal junctions in myelinated nerves (Ayuso-García et al., 2024). Notably, the stabilization of key cytoskeletal regulators could favor the proper delivery and surface expression of cell adhesion molecules such as Neurofascin-155, which plays a pivotal role in the assembly and maintenance of paranodal junctions (Ayuso-García et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Molecule-level studies have further shown that Pevonedistat forms a covalent adduct with NEDD8 when bound to NAE, effectively “trapping” the enzyme in an inactive state and leading to the downstream effects mentioned above (Shah et al., 2016). Thus, while the predominant focus of published work has been on its application in oncology, the biochemical action of Pevonedistat is mechanistically relevant to the regulation of protein turnover in Schwann cells—a system that, when dysregulated, may contribute to features of CMT pathology (Bhatia et al., 2016).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis under consideration, Pevonedistat is expected to promote paranodal junction integrity in models of CMT by stabilizing CRL substrates that are crucial for cytoskeletal regulation and trafficking in Schwann cells. In CMT, defects in Schwann cell myelination and paranodal junction assembly result in destabilization of the membrane and impaired nerve conduction; these deficits are thought to arise, at least in part, from aberrant protein turnover and mislocalization of key cell adhesion molecules (Ayuso-García et al., 2024). The proposed mechanism suggests that by inhibiting NAE, Pevonedistat will lead to a reduced turnover of Rho-GEFs and other trafficking adaptors, thereby promoting a more stable actin cytoskeleton. A robust actin network is essential for the trafficking and targeted membrane delivery of paranodal cell adhesion molecules such as Neurofascin-155, a protein expressed in Schwann cells that is integral to the formation and maintenance of paranodal junctions (Ayuso-García et al., 2024). In proposed dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co-culture assays, treatment with Pevonedistat is hypothesized to increase the surface expression of neurofascin and other paranodal cell adhesion molecules, resulting in enhanced paranodal junction formation and improved myelination (Ayuso-García et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preliminary pharmacokinetic studies in rodent models have indicated that Pevonedistat achieves measurable exposure in peripheral nerves, which is encouraging for its repurposing in a neuropathy context where localized drug levels in the nerve tissue are critical for therapeutic efficacy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, past oncology trials have provided a safety profile that, despite some dose-limiting toxicities observed at higher concentrations, suggests that controlled dosing regimens may be achievable in non-cancer patients if retargeted appropriately (Bhatia et al., 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
In our comprehensive literature review, Pevonedistat emerges as a promising yet challenging candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. One of the foremost strengths of Pevonedistat lies in its novel mechanism of action; by specifically targeting the NAE, it offers a unique means of modulating the neddylation pathway and thereby stabilizing proteins that are otherwise subject to rapid turnover by CRL complexes (Shah et al., 2016; Bhatia et al., 2016). This mechanism is particularly appealing in CMT, where dysregulation in the turnover of cytoskeletal regulators and trafficking components may underpin defects in paranodal junction formation and myelination (Ayuso-García et al., 2024). In controlled preclinical settings—such as DRG-Schwann cell co-cultures—there is a strong rationale to test whether Pevonedistat can indeed increase the surface levels of critical membrane proteins like Neurofascin-155, thereby reinforcing paranodal junction integrity and promoting more effective myelination (Ayuso-García et al., 2024).

Another significant advantage is the relatively extensive clinical history of Pevonedistat in oncology. The drug has been through several Phase I studies in cancer patients (e.g., Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 2008; National Cancer Institute, 2011; Bhatia et al., 2016), where its pharmacokinetic profile, dose-proportional exposure, and target engagement have been well documented. This body of data could potentially accelerate repurposing efforts by providing a solid foundation regarding safety and human pharmacokinetics, although it should be noted that the concentration ranges and dosing schedules optimized for cancer treatment might differ markedly from those required to achieve therapeutic benefit in a neuropathic context (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 2008; Bhatia et al., 2016).

Despite these strengths, several caveats must be carefully considered. Some of the preclinical literature, notably by Ayuso-García et al., indicates that inhibition of neddylation in Schwann cells can lead to impaired myelination and peripheral nerve dysfunction if not precisely calibrated (Ayuso-García et al., 2024). This suggests that a complete or excessive blockade of the neddylation pathway in Schwann cells may exacerbate rather than ameliorate the myelination defects characteristic of CMT. The hypothesis proposes that a controlled, titrated inhibition could instead stabilize specific CRL substrates—including regulators of actin dynamics and endocytic trafficking—that are beneficial for maintaining paranodal integrity. However, establishing the correct dosing window where beneficial effects are observed without inducing deleterious outcomes will be critical. There is a fine line between the desired stabilization of cytoskeletal regulators and the unintended blockade of essential proliferative or differentiation signals in Schwann cells (Ayuso-García et al., 2024).

Moreover, while pharmacokinetic studies in rodents have provided preliminary evidence of peripheral nerve exposure, these findings need to be corroborated in additional preclinical models that mimic the human pathology of CMT. Detailed assessments of drug distribution, particularly in the peripheral nervous system, will be essential to ascertain whether therapeutically useful concentrations of Pevonedistat can be achieved without systemic toxicity (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, the potential for off-target effects remains a concern. Because neddylation regulates a broad range of cellular processes, systemic inhibition could disrupt functions in other tissues, leading to unintended side effects. A comprehensive safety evaluation will be necessary to determine if the benefits of improved paranodal junction integrity outweigh the risks associated with global inhibition of neddylation (Bhatia et al., 2016).

Another area of uncertainty is whether the molecular targets implicated in the hypothesis—specifically, the stabilization of Rho GTPase regulators and trafficking proteins that govern Neurofascin-155 targeting—are indeed the critical nodes that can be modulated by Pevonedistat in a clinically meaningful way in CMT patients. While there is a theoretical basis for this mechanism, further molecular studies are required to validate that these specific CRL substrates are altered in CMT and that their stabilization leads to measurable improvements in paranodal junction architecture and nerve conduction (Ayuso-García et al., 2024). Preclinical data from DRG co-culture systems will be essential in demonstrating that Pevonedistat treatment results in a quantitative increase in surface levels of paranodal cell adhesion molecules and that this correlates with functional recovery in nerve conduction assays.

In summary, Pevonedistat represents an innovative therapeutic candidate with a mechanism of action that is uniquely poised to influence protein turnover in Schwann cells—a cellular process that is critical for the maintenance of paranodal junctions in peripheral nerves. Its extensive clinical history in oncology offers a valuable repository of safety and pharmacokinetic data which could be leveraged during repurposing efforts. However, the challenge lies in achieving the right balance of neddylation inhibition to promote cytoskeletal stabilization and proper trafficking of paranodal components without inducing adverse effects on overall Schwann cell function and myelination. The promising hypothesis—that Pevonedistat will promote paranodal junction integrity by stabilizing key regulators of actin dynamics and membrane protein trafficking—is supported by biochemical principles and preliminary preclinical studies in related cell types (Ayuso-García et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nonetheless, the contradictory evidence suggesting that excessive neddylation inhibition impairs myelination necessitates a cautious and methodical experimental approach. Future work should focus on dose-ranging studies in relevant in vitro and in vivo models of CMT to precisely delineate the therapeutic window in which Pevonedistat exerts beneficial effects on paranodal junctions while preserving overall Schwann cell viability and function (Ayuso-García et al., 2024; Bhatia et al., 2016). Furthermore, it will be crucial to identify and validate biomarkers that can monitor target engagement specifically in the peripheral nervous system, thereby ensuring that the pharmacodynamic effects observed in oncology studies are recapitulated in the context of neuropathy.

Overall, while Pevonedistat holds promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease based on its novel mechanism of modulating protein turnover and its potential to stabilize cytoskeletal and trafficking regulators in Schwann cells, significant concerns remain that must be addressed through rigorous preclinical testing. Its well-established pharmacokinetic and safety profile in oncology is an asset; however, whether these parameters translate to a favorable risk-benefit profile in CMT is far from confirmed. The strengths of this candidate lie in its unique mechanism that targets a fundamental cellular process and the availability of extensive clinical data from cancer trials, which could accelerate its repurposing. The weaknesses include the possibility of exacerbating demyelination if neddylation is overly inhibited and the need for precise dosing strategies to avoid interfering with essential Schwann cell functions. In conclusion, Pevonedistat is a candidate with strong scientific rationale that warrants further investigation in preclinical models of CMT, with careful attention to dosing, target validation, and the identification of peripheral nerve-specific biomarkers. Only through such a comprehensive evaluation can its potential for promoting paranodal junction integrity and improving clinical outcomes in CMT be accurately assessed (Ayuso-García et al., 2024; Bhatia et al., 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
