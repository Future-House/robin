Proposal for 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # A2124)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) is a synthetic small molecule belonging to the aminopyridine class of compounds that was originally discovered for its ability to block voltage‐gated potassium (Kv) channels. Its synthesis and commercialization have led to consistent production with well‐defined purity, exemplified by products such as Sigma-Aldrich catalog # A2124. Aminopyridines as a class have been historically developed for applications including reversal of neuromuscular blockade and improvement of nerve conduction, and over subsequent decades have been repurposed for a variety of demyelinating conditions. The compound’s origin can be traced back to studies of Kv channel structure–activity relationships, where research demonstrated its capacity to bind within the channel pore and modify gating kinetics (Daly, 2014). This class of molecules has been consistently evaluated for their utility in restoring impaired conduction in demyelinated axons, making them relevant candidates when addressing neuropathies characterized by disrupted myelin architecture.

Therapeutic History:
4-AP has an established therapeutic history in both clinical and preclinical settings. It has been used in multiple sclerosis (MS) as a symptomatic treatment to improve walking speed, muscle strength, and overall conduction in demyelinated central nervous system (CNS) pathways, with formulations such as dalfampridine (fampridine-SR) receiving regulatory approval (Bever, 1994). In addition, preclinical studies have demonstrated its neuroprotective and conduction enhancing effects not only in models of CNS demyelination but also in peripheral nerve injury models. For example, in studies based on peripheral nerve crush injury, 4-AP was shown to promote remyelination and functional recovery (Tseng et al., 2016). Although its direct evaluation in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease has been limited – as captured by clinical trial searches that have identified only two relevant studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) – there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the mechanism by which 4-AP improves conduction in diseases such as MS and in Trembler-J mouse models of peripheral demyelination may be applicable to hereditary neuropathies like CMT (De Giglio et al., 2020). Moreover, its safety profile in humans is well characterized from studies in spinal cord injury and MS patients, supporting rapid repurposing for indications that share similar pathological hallmarks (Dietrich et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
4-AP exerts its therapeutic effect by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels in demyelinated neurons, thereby modifying the ionic conductances that normally facilitate repolarization. Under healthy conditions, the myelin sheath insulates axons and restricts the localization of Kv channels primarily to the juxtaparanodal regions; however, in demyelinating conditions such as CMT, the disruption of paranodal junctions allows mislocalized Kv channels (notably Kv1.1 and Kv1.2) to invade the nodal gap, leading to abnormal potassium efflux that reduces action potential amplitude and interrupts saltatory conduction (Daly, 2014; Leussink et al., 2018). By binding within these channels, 4-AP prolongs the depolarization phase of the action potential, allowing sufficient time for voltage-gated sodium channels to reengage and restore conduction along the axon (Jensen et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2000). At the molecular level, patch-clamp assays in ex vivo nerve preparations have confirmed that 4-AP reduces the magnitude of the outward potassium current in a dose-dependent manner, directly correlating with enhanced action potential propagation (Qiao et al., 1997; Rodríguez-Rangel et al., 2020). The compound hence acts specifically by decreasing the aberrant K⁺ efflux that is a consequence of paranodal disorganization, thereby restoring the conditions necessary for normal saltatory conduction in demyelinated fibers.

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis is that 4-AP will restore nerve conduction in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease by selectively blocking mislocalized Kv1.1/Kv1.2 channels at disrupted paranodal regions. In the context of CMT, where paranodal junction disorganization is a key pathological feature, the misplacement of these Kv channels results in excessive K⁺ efflux that diminishes the safety factor required for efficient action potential propagation (De Giglio et al., 2020). By inhibiting these ectopic channels, 4-AP is expected to reduce the abnormal leakage of potassium ions, allowing the action potential to be maintained at a higher amplitude and improving conduction velocity. Electrophysiological assays, such as those utilizing patch-clamp techniques, have demonstrated that 4-AP increases action potential duration and enhances synaptic transmission in demyelinated axons (Jensen et al., 2014). This enhanced conduction is anticipated to translate into measurable improvements in nerve conduction studies in patients with CMT, mirroring results observed in similar demyelinating conditions where increased neurotransmitter release and muscle activation have been documented (Tseng et al., 2016; Leussink et al., 2018). Additionally, the peripheral nerve exposure and pharmacokinetic profile of 4-AP support its capacity to reach the affected neurons in the peripheral nervous system, while its well-established safety profile in human studies further underpins its translational promise (Dietrich et al., 2021; King et al., 2012).

Overall Evaluation:
Taking into account the available preclinical, clinical, and biochemical data, 4-AP emerges as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. One of its major strengths lies in its well-documented mechanism of action: by selectively blocking aberrantly localized Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 channels, 4-AP addresses a critical pathophysiological mechanism underlying conduction failure in CMT. The compound’s ability to prolong action potentials and improve neurotransmitter release in demyelinated axons has been consistently demonstrated in both central and peripheral models of demyelination (Smith et al., 2000; Leussink et al., 2018). Furthermore, its extensive clinical usage in conditions such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries has established both its efficacy and safety profile, which is advantageous for rapid repurposing. Preclinical studies using nerve preparations and animal models – including those in peripheral nerve crush scenarios – provide supportive evidence for its potential utility in restoring conduction in disrupted paranodal regions (Tseng et al., 2016; Noble et al., 2019).

Nevertheless, there are certain challenges and weaknesses that must be acknowledged. Although the mechanistic rationale and preclinical data strongly support the use of 4-AP in demyelinating conditions, direct clinical evidence in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease remains sparse. The existing literature primarily focuses on its application in central demyelination (e.g., MS), and while there is translational rationale based on similar mechanisms, the heterogeneity of CMT pathology may pose additional obstacles requiring tailored clinical investigations (Sedehizadeh et al., 2012; De Giglio et al., 2020). In addition, potential issues related to dosing and the narrow therapeutic window of 4-AP – exemplified by its known proconvulsant effects at higher serum concentrations – continue to necessitate careful dose optimization and may require the development of sustained-release formulations to minimize side effects (King et al., 2012; Hansebout et al., 1993). Finally, the molecular specificity regarding Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 blockade in the context of the CMT pathology will need to be further validated in targeted preclinical models to ensure that the intended channel engagement is achieved without detrimental off-target effects (Daly, 2014; Qiao, 1998).

In summary, 4-Aminopyridine presents as an attractive candidate for repurposing in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease based on its well-established mechanism of enhancing nerve conduction via selective Kv channel blockade, its favorable drug exposure profiles in peripheral nerves, supportive electrophysiological evidence, and its clinical track record in other demyelinating disorders. However, given the limited direct clinical evidence in CMT, further preclinical studies and dedicated clinical trials are crucial to unequivocally establish its efficacy and safety in this particular indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024). Overall, the strengths—mechanistic specificity, established translational precedence, and documented pharmacokinetic and safety profiles—outweigh the current limitations, making 4-AP a compelling candidate for further development in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
