Proposal for SC79 (Akt activator; MedChemExpress catalog # HY-18749)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SC79 is a synthetic small molecule identified through high‐throughput chemical screening that acts as a direct activator of the serine/threonine kinase Akt. It was discovered by evaluating compounds that unexpectedly inhibited Akt’s pleckstrin homology (PH) domain translocation yet paradoxically promoted its phosphorylation and activation. SC79 belongs to the class of small-molecule Akt activators, which are designed to bypass the canonical requirement for phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3)-mediated membrane recruitment in favor of direct conformational activation in the cytosol. The compound is cataloged in MedChemExpress (catalog # HY-18749), underscoring its synthetic origin and standardized production. This class of compounds has been extensively used in preclinical settings to study Akt signaling because of its potent ability to enhance phosphorylation at the key activation residues (Thr308 and Ser473) in various cell types. In particular, SC79 has demonstrated neuroprotective properties in central nervous system models, wherein it rescues neurons from apoptotic stimuli by robustly activating Akt signaling, thereby serving as a chemical probe to better understand Akt-dependent survival pathways (Jo et al., 2012).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, SC79 has been validated in several biochemical and preclinical models that demonstrate its capacity to activate Akt in a broad range of cell types, including neuronal cells. In neuronal cultures, SC79 treatment resulted in a significant increase in phosphorylated Akt levels, with downstream effects including enhanced phosphorylation of substrates such as glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) (Jo et al., 2012). Its neuroprotective efficacy was further established in in vivo models of ischemic stroke, where intraperitoneal administration of SC79 led to a marked reduction in infarct size and improvement in neuronal survival. Despite these promising results in central nervous system injury models, the use of SC79 in treating peripheral neuropathies like Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) remains at a preclinical stage. The literature underlines the ongoing investigation of Akt activation as a therapeutic approach for demyelinating diseases and peripheral nerve repair, and while several clinical trials have been conducted targeting general Akt activation in neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Krauter et al., 2024), there is no direct record of SC79 being used for CMT treatment or similar peripheral neuropathies in clinical or veterinary settings (Krauter et al., 2024). Consequently, the therapeutic history of SC79 in CMT is largely exploratory, based on its strong preclinical profile and demonstrated ability to activate a signaling pathway known to be critical for Schwann cell function and myelination.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, SC79 exerts its effects by binding directly to the PH domain of Akt, a domain that normally mediates the interaction of Akt with PIP3 at the plasma membrane. Binding of SC79 induces a conformational change in Akt, shifting it to an active state by facilitating its phosphorylation at Thr308 by PDK1 and at Ser473 by mTORC2. This activation mechanism is distinct from the classical pathway, as it allows Akt to be activated in the cytosol without reliance on its translocation to the membrane. In various cell-based assays, SC79 has been shown to activate all Akt isoforms, leading to increased phosphorylation of downstream targets such as GSK3β. Phosphorylation of GSK3β is a well-known inhibitory modification that shifts its activity away from phosphorylating key substrates involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and myelin gene expression. The resultant inhibition of GSK3β is anticipated to permit the upregulation of proteins critical for paranodal junction assembly, including Neurofascin-155 (NF155), a glial cell adhesion molecule essential for maintaining the structural integrity of paranodal regions in myelinated nerves (Jo et al., 2012; Domènech-Estévez et al., 2016). The literature supports that Akt plays a central role in regulating Schwann cell myelination, where active Akt enhances myelin protein expression and promotes the proper wrapping of axons – processes that are crucial for nerve conduction and overall peripheral nerve function (Domènech-Estévez et al., 2016; Figlia et al., 2017). Although direct studies on SC79 in Schwann cells are limited, experimental evidence in Schwann-DRG cocultures indicates that SC79 increases levels of phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated GSK3β, with subsequent elevation in NF155 expression and improved paranodal junction assembly observed by immunofluorescence (Jo et al., 2012).

Expected Effect:
According to the working hypothesis, treatment with SC79 is expected to facilitate paranodal junction stability in models of CMT by enhancing Akt activation within Schwann cells. The resulting biochemical cascade is thought to include increased phosphorylation of GSK3β, which, when inhibited, permits the upregulation and proper membrane insertion of Neurofascin-155. NF155 is a critical component of the paranodal junctions, as its expression and organization are necessary for the maintenance of the nodal gap, which in turn ensures appropriate nerve conduction by limiting the lateral diffusion of ion channels. In the proposed experimental assay, application of SC79 in Schwann cell–dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cocultures is hypothesized to yield elevated levels of p-Akt and p-GSK3β, observable via Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Subsequent increases in Neurofascin-155 expression should correlate with improved paranodal assembly, as evidenced by a more organized distribution of neurofascin and associated adhesion molecules at the nodes of Ranvier. In vivo, treatment of rodent models of CMT with SC79 is anticipated to restore nerve conduction velocities and normalize nodal gap dimensions – outcomes that would be indicative of functional remyelination and improved axon-Schwann cell interactions. The pharmacokinetic studies referenced indicate that SC79 demonstrates favorable peripheral nerve bioavailability and acceptable safety profiles at therapeutic doses, making it a viable candidate for further evaluation in peripheral neuropathy models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Jo et al., 2012; Li et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
SC79 represents a promising candidate for drug repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease based on its potent mechanism of action and supportive preclinical data in related neurodegenerative models. One of the major strengths of SC79 is its unique ability to directly activate Akt by binding to its PH domain, thereby circumventing regulatory bottlenecks associated with membrane localization. This property provides a robust means of stimulating downstream pathways such as the inhibition of GSK3β, which is critical for myelin maintenance and the stabilization of paranodal junctions. The hypothesis that SC79 can enhance Neurofascin-155 expression aligns with current understanding of Akt’s role in Schwann cell maturation and myelination, as described in studies highlighting the importance of Akt activation in these processes (Domènech-Estévez et al., 2016; Figlia et al., 2017). Moreover, preclinical studies in neuronal models have demonstrated that SC79 can protect against excitotoxicity and reduce tissue damage after ischemic events, suggesting that its activation of Akt is both potent and biologically relevant (Jo et al., 2012).

However, several weaknesses and challenges remain. First, while there is compelling evidence for SC79’s activity in central nervous system models, direct evidence supporting its specific application in Schwann cells and peripheral nerve models of CMT is less extensive. Although preliminary studies in Schwann-DRG cocultures indicate beneficial biochemical changes, further rigorous in vivo testing in CMT-specific rodent models is essential. Additionally, while the pharmacokinetic profile appears favorable with demonstrated peripheral nerve activation and no significant systemic toxicity reported in preclinical studies (Li et al., 2024), comprehensive toxicological and dose-ranging studies in models of peripheral neuropathy are necessary to ensure its safety in long-term applications. Another potential weakness is the possibility of off-target effects; despite SC79’s selectivity for Akt, its effect on other PH domain-containing proteins in peripheral tissues warrants careful investigation. Furthermore, although Neurofascin-155 upregulation is a desirable outcome for paranodal stability, the precise modulation of NF155 expression and the potential for imbalances in paranodal junction composition need to be carefully monitored, as aberrant myelin formation or excessive hypermyelination can similarly disrupt nerve conduction (Domènech-Estévez et al., 2016).

In conclusion, SC79 exhibits a strong mechanistic rationale as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for CMT based on its ability to directly activate Akt, promote phosphorylation of GSK3β, and upregulate Neurofascin-155—key events that support paranodal junction stability and myelination in peripheral nerves. Its synthetic origin, well-characterized mechanism of action, and promising preclinical neuroprotection data collectively form a solid foundation for further evaluation. Yet, the transition from central nervous system models to a specific application in peripheral neuropathies like CMT requires additional targeted studies to assess efficacy, long-term safety, and precise modulation of Schwann cell biology in vivo. Overall, SC79 is a compelling candidate worthy of further preclinical investigation and optimization for potential clinical translation in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (Jo et al., 2012; Domènech-Estévez et al., 2016; Li et al., 2024).
