Proposal for SS-31 (Elamipretide; Stealth BioTherapeutics research-grade)

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of SS-31 (Elamipretide; Stealth BioTherapeutics research‐grade) as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth Disease (CMT), with particular emphasis on its potential to stabilize paranodal junctions via targeting cardiolipin, enhancing mitochondrial dynamics, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby supporting the proper trafficking of paranodal adhesion complexes.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SS-31 is a synthetic, cell‐permeable, aromatic–cationic tetrapeptide that was originally developed by the Szeto–Schiller research group. It is a member of the Szeto–Schiller peptide class whose members share alternating aromatic and cationic residues; this structure permits rapid cellular uptake and preferential accumulation within mitochondria. The compound was engineered specifically to target the inner mitochondrial membrane by binding to cardiolipin, a unique anionic phospholipid that plays an essential role in maintaining mitochondrial structure, cristae integrity, and function. The synthesis of SS-31 involves solid-phase peptide synthesis techniques common to small peptides, and its design was based on the principle that stabilizing cardiolipin would protect mitochondrial function under conditions of elevated oxidative stress. As such, SS-31 belongs to a class of mitochondrial-targeted therapeutic peptides that have been explored for a wide range of degenerative and ischemic conditions, and its mechanism of action is rooted in modulating mitochondrial bioenergetics rather than directly scavenging ROS. This class of compounds has previously been used in preclinical models of heart failure, myopathy and retinal degeneration, underscoring their broad utility in conditions where mitochondria are compromised (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Mitchell et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
SS-31 has been evaluated in numerous clinical trials and preclinical studies focusing on disorders with mitochondrial dysfunction. It has been investigated extensively in primary mitochondrial myopathies (e.g., NCT05162768; Karaa et al., 2018; Karaa et al., 2023), heart failure models (Chatfield et al., 2019), and retinal degenerative conditions (Stealth BioTherapeutics, Inc., 2019). Preclinical studies in various mitochondrial disease models, including mitochondrial cardiomyopathies such as DCMA (Machiraju et al., 2019) and Barth syndrome (Sabbah, 2021), have consistently shown that SS-31 can restore mitochondrial morphology, improve respiratory functions, and reduce oxidative damage through its interaction with cardiolipin. Although SS-31 has not been directly evaluated in clinical studies of CMT or MFN2-linked neuropathies, there is convergent evidence from models of mitochondrial myopathy and heart failure that its mitochondria-stabilizing actions could be beneficial in diseases where mitochondrial dynamics and energy production are impaired (Rahman, 2019; Bottani et al., 2020; Stealth BioTherapeutics, Inc., n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
The biochemical profile of SS-31 is defined primarily by its selective and reversible binding to cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Cardiolipin is critical for anchoring key proteins of the electron transport chain (ETC) into supercomplexes that enhance oxidative phosphorylation, and its stabilization improves ATP synthesis. SS-31 binds through a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that insert the peptide’s aromatic residues into the hydrophobic membrane region while its positive charge interacts with the negatively charged phosphate groups of cardiolipin. This interaction confers several downstream benefits: it stabilizes mitochondrial cristae architecture, increases electron flux through respiratory complexes (notably complexes I and IV), and reduces electron leak that underlies ROS generation (Birk et al., 2014; Mitchell et al., 2019). In addition, SS-31 has been shown to improve mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics by indirectly influencing proteins involved in these processes, such as DRP1 and OPA1, and – in preclinical settings – has even normalized DRP1 activity in models where mitochondrial fragmentation is evident (Machiraju et al., 2019; Mitchell et al., 2022). Its antioxidative effects derive primarily from reducing ROS production by preserving mitochondrial membrane potential and minimizing peroxidative damage to cardiolipin, rather than serving as a direct antioxidant. Overall, the molecular interactions of SS-31 with cardiolipin provide a strong mechanistic rationale for its ability to restore normal mitochondrial function across various cell types, including in neurons and Schwann cells that are critical for peripheral nerve health (El-Hattab et al., 2017; Ji et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, SS-31 is hypothesized to stabilize the paranodal junctions in peripheral nerves affected by CMT, particularly in MFN2-linked CMT2A where mitochondrial fusion is impaired. In this context, SS-31 is expected to bind cardiolipin within neuronal mitochondria and Schwann cells – cell types that express MFN2 and rely on dynamic and healthy mitochondria for ATP production and calcium regulation. Through its ability to reinforce cardiolipin integrity, SS-31 should enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics, leading to a reduction in ROS that otherwise would damage cellular components including paranodal adhesion molecules such as Caspr1 and Contactin-1. Preclinical studies indicate that by restoring mitochondrial morphology and function (e.g., by normalizing DRP1 and OPA1 activity), SS-31 can rescue mitochondrial transport deficits and improve the organization of paranodal complexes in treated sciatic nerve preparations. Functional assays in these models have demonstrated improved nerve conduction velocities when mitochondrial dynamics are preserved, suggesting that the preservation of paranodal junctions is a plausible outcome (Karaa et al., 2024; Nhu et al., 2022). Given the favorable pharmacokinetics observed in mitochondrial disease trials and the established safety profile of SS-31 in previous clinical studies, the application of SS-31 to CMT is expected to yield therapeutic effects by mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction, reducing oxidative stress, and indirectly stabilizing paranodal junctions that are vital for proper nerve impulse conduction (Sabbah, 2020; Almutawaa, 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall assessment of SS-31 as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot–Marie–Tooth Disease, particularly in the MFN2-linked CMT2A subtype, is highly promising from a mechanistic standpoint. Strengths of this candidate include its well-documented ability to stabilize mitochondrial membranes through specific interaction with cardiolipin, thereby enhancing oxidative phosphorylation and reducing ROS production. SS-31’s capacity to improve mitochondrial dynamics – as evidenced by restoration of normal mitochondrial morphology in cell models and various animal studies – supports its potential to rescue the mitochondrial transport deficits that underlie axonal degeneration seen in CMT2A (Machiraju et al., 2019; Mitchell et al., 2022). Moreover, its favorable safety profile and established efficacy in other mitochondrial disorders, coupled with proof-of-concept data from clinical trials in primary mitochondrial myopathy and heart failure, provide supportive evidence for its repurposing in CMT (Karaa et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Potential weaknesses include the current lack of direct clinical evidence in CMT models. Although mechanistic studies suggest that SS-31 may normalize DRP1 dynamics and facilitate the correct trafficking of paranodal adhesion complexes, further targeted preclinical experiments are needed to verify its effects on paranodal junction stabilization specifically in peripheral nerves. In addition, while SS-31 displays excellent pharmacokinetic properties in tissues with high mitochondrial content, it remains to be determined if it achieves the necessary concentration in peripheral nerve tissue affected by CMT. Moreover, disease heterogeneity in CMT, particularly in different genetic subtypes, might influence the therapeutic efficacy of SS-31, meaning that the candidate might be more effective in MFN2-linked forms than in other subtypes of the disease (Sarajärvi, 2020; Unknown Reference).

In summary, SS-31 has a strong mechanistic rationale for testing in CMT due to its specific targeting of cardiolipin—a critical mediator of mitochondrial integrity—and its documented capability in reducing oxidative stress while restoring mitochondrial dynamics. Its use in other mitochondrial and neuromuscular diseases lends further support to its repurposing for CMT. Provided that the upcoming preclinical studies confirm stabilization of paranodal junctions and improved mitochondrial transport in MFN2-deficient models, SS-31 could represent a revolutionary mitochondria-centric therapeutic approach in CMT, addressing unmet needs in this challenging group of neuropathies (Lynch, 2022; Sarajärvi, 2020; Tamucci et al., 2023). Continued investigation into its pharmacodynamics in peripheral nerves and its ability to sustain long-term improvements in nerve conduction will be pivotal in determining its ultimate clinical utility for CMT (Stealth BioTherapeutics, Inc., 2016; Chatfield et al., 2019).

Overall, while further targeted research is needed to validate paranodal junction stability and robust clinical efficacy in MFN2-linked CMT2A, SS-31 stands out as a candidate with a strong biochemical foundation, favorable safety record, and promising early mechanistic data that justify its prioritization for further preclinical and clinical studies in the CMT therapeutic landscape.
