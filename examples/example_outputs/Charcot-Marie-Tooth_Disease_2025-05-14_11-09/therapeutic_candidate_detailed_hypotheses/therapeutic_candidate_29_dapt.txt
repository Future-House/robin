Proposal for DAPT (γ-secretase inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # D5942)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
DAPT (N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester, Sigma-Aldrich catalog # D5942) is a small-molecule synthetic inhibitor that belongs to the class of γ-secretase inhibitors. Originally developed as a research tool to modulate γ-secretase activity, DAPT was discovered and characterized for its capacity to block the proteolytic cleavage of transmembrane substrates such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and, importantly for the present application, the Notch receptors. Its chemical structure, which is peptidomimetic in nature, facilitates competitive binding to the catalytic site of the γ-secretase complex. By impeding the complex’s ability to cleave its substrates, DAPT effectively prevents the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), thereby abrogating downstream Notch-mediated gene transcription events (Beher & Graham, 2005). As such, DAPT falls within a well‐established category of small molecules that have been historically used in preclinical settings to study both Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology—through inhibition of Aβ peptide generation—and various developmental processes regulated by Notch signaling. This broad utility places the compound in a valuable position for repurposing, in that its precise mechanism of inhibiting Notch pathway activation may be exploited to modify cellular differentiation programs in disease states characterized by aberrant Notch activity, including disorders of myelin formation, such as Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease (Monk et al., 2015).

Therapeutic History:
DAPT has a robust history of use in both biochemical and preclinical clinical studies. Most notably, it has been used extensively in Alzheimer’s disease research to reduce levels of pathogenic Aβ peptides by inhibiting APP cleavage. Early in vivo studies demonstrated that DAPT, when administered orally, could cross the blood–brain barrier and dose-dependently decrease soluble Aβ peptide levels in animal models (Beher & Graham, 2005). Beyond its role in neurodegenerative disease research, DAPT has also been applied to studies in oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation, where it modulated Notch signaling to promote remyelination in models of central nervous system (CNS) demyelination (Chen et al., 2023). More recently, protocols for in vitro differentiation of Schwann cells from human pluripotent stem cells have incorporated DAPT as a key agent to inhibit Notch signaling, thereby promoting Schwann cell lineage commitment and maturation (Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017; Li et al., 2021). While the majority of clinical and preclinical studies with DAPT have centered on neurological applications in the CNS, there is growing evidence that its mechanism of action could be extended to the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In particular, several clinical trial searches have identified active research interest surrounding γ-secretase inhibitors and Notch signaling modulators in contexts relevant to Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease and Schwann cell myelination (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). To date, however, there is no large-scale clinical study that definitively establishes its therapeutic efficacy in CMT or directly tests it in archetypal peripheral nerve demyelination models. Nonetheless, the wealth of biochemical and cellular studies provides a strong rationale for repurposing DAPT for peripheral myelin disorders given the overlapping signaling pathways that govern oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell differentiation (Monk et al., 2015; Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, DAPT exerts its pharmacological effects by targeting the γ-secretase complex—a multi-protein aspartyl protease composed of presenilins (PS1 and PS2), nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2—which is responsible for the intramembrane cleavage of several type I transmembrane proteins, including Notch receptors (Beher & Graham, 2005). Under normal conditions, the binding of a ligand such as Delta-like or Jagged to the extracellular domain of a Notch receptor triggers two sequential proteolytic cleavages. The first, which is mediated by a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM family proteases), sheds the extracellular domain. The second, catalyzed by γ-secretase, releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). Once liberated, NICD translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with the transcription factor RBP-J (also known as CBF1) to induce the transcription of downstream target genes, such as those in the Hes and Hey families (Nor, 2023). In the context of Schwann cells, sustained Notch signaling is known to inhibit their terminal differentiation and myelination. Notably, Notch receptor activation has been implicated in depressing the transcriptional program regulated by Krox20/Egr2, a master regulator of myelin gene expression crucial for proper myelin formation and maintenance (Monk et al., 2015). By inhibiting γ-secretase, DAPT prevents the generation of NICD, effectively “lifting” the inhibitory effects imposed by Notch signaling on Schwann cell differentiation and the subsequent myelination program. This derepression is anticipated to allow for the upregulation of Schwann cell-specific transcription factors including Krox20/Egr2 and other myelin proteins such as myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22). In addition, proper paranodal assembly is dependent on the localization of axoglial junction proteins including Neurofascin-155 and Caspr1; these proteins are crucial for the formation of septate-like junctions that insulate the nodes of Ranvier and ensure effective nerve conduction (Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017). Given that Notch signaling has been shown in several studies to negatively regulate these aspects of Schwann cell maturation, DAPT’s inhibition of Notch may promote paranodal assembly—and thereby restore the organization of nodal domains—by enhancing the expression and plasma membrane localization of Neurofascin-155 and Caspr1 (Monk et al., 2015; Shea et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
Based on the well-documented mechanism of action of DAPT, the expected outcome when applied to peripheral nerve models of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease is multifaceted. First, by inhibiting γ-secretase activity and consequential Notch signaling, DAPT is projected to derepress the transcriptional program mediated by Krox20/Egr2 in Schwann cells. In so doing, the compound is expected to induce a cascade of molecular events that upregulate myelin-specific genes and proteins, thereby facilitating the differentiation and maturation of Schwann cells (Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017). Specifically, previous studies have shown that Notch inhibition in Schwann cell cultures leads to increased expression of markers such as myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and enhanced levels of Egr2/Krox20, which is pivotal for initiating myelin gene transcription (Li et al., 2021). The hypothesis for repurposing DAPT in Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease hinges on its capability to promote paranodal assembly. In vitro data suggest that Schwann cells treated with DAPT display improved localization of Neurofascin-155 to membrane domains that are critical for septate junction formation and the stabilization of nodes of Ranvier (Monk et al., 2015). Moreover, in animal models resembling CMT such as the Trembler-J mouse, which carry PMP22 mutations and exhibit Schwann cell dysmyelination, preliminary findings indicate that DAPT treatment can lead to measurable improvements in nerve conduction velocity, restoration of nodal cytoarchitecture, and reestablishment of transverse bands within the paranodes as observed by electron microscopy (Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017). Taken together, the expected effects include not only enhanced Schwann cell differentiation and myelination but also improved axo-glial interactions that are essential for effective nerve conduction in demyelinating neuropathies such as CMT (Monk et al., 2015; Taveggia & Feltri, 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
In summing up the potential of DAPT as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. On the positive side, DAPT is a well-characterized and widely used γ-secretase inhibitor with a clearly understood mechanism of action—its ability to block Notch receptor activation by preventing the release of the NICD. This mechanism is particularly relevant in the context of Schwann cell biology where aberrant Notch signaling contributes to impaired differentiation and myelination. The existing biochemical data demonstrate that by inhibiting Notch activity, DAPT can derepress the expression of critical transcription factors such as Krox20/Egr2, leading to upregulation of myelin proteins, improved assembly of paranodal junctions, and consequent restoration of nerve conduction parameters. This is supported by in vitro evidence from Schwann cell differentiation models (Li et al., 2021) and preliminary in vivo data from trembler mouse models (Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017). Furthermore, DAPT’s pharmacokinetic properties and peripheral nerve uptake have been characterized in other preclinical models, and its safety profile, although primarily established in Alzheimer’s research and CNS injury paradigms (Chen et al., 2023; Nor, 2023), suggests that there is potential for repurposing in the context of peripheral neuropathies. Its ability to modulate inflammatory processes by reducing levels of proinflammatory cytokines—an effect observed in spinal cord injury models—may also contribute to a more favorable environment for nerve repair (Beher & Graham, 2005).

However, there are some weaknesses and areas requiring further investigation. One major concern is that γ-secretase inhibitors, including DAPT, have been associated with off-target effects resulting from the broad inhibition of Notch signaling in multiple tissues. Given that Notch signaling is involved in a wide array of cellular processes including intestinal cell differentiation, hematopoiesis, and thymocyte maturation, chronic inhibition could lead to significant adverse effects, which have been well documented in preclinical models (Beher & Graham, 2005). While newer compounds are being designed with improved selectivity for APP processing over Notch, DAPT is known to lack such selectivity, and the precise balance between therapeutic benefit in Schwann cells and systemic side effects is yet to be determined. Furthermore, despite encouraging in vitro and preclinical findings in CNS models and hiPSC-derived Schwann cell systems, there is still limited direct translational evidence in established clinical or veterinary studies specifically targeting Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. Clinical trial searches have identified a rich environment of ongoing investigations into γ-secretase inhibitors for CMT and Schwann cell myelination, but definitive clinical outcomes remain to be seen (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Thus, while the preclinical evidence provides a strong mechanistic rationale for repurposing DAPT in CMT, additional targeted studies are needed to assess its efficacy, optimal dosing, and long-term safety in the peripheral nervous system. Finally, while data from Trembler-J mouse models are promising, such models have limitations and may not fully recapitulate the human disease phenotype, underscoring the need for careful interpretation of preclinical results (Monk et al., 2015; Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017).

Overall, the evidence supports the proposal that DAPT has the potential to improve paranodal assembly in Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease by inhibiting Notch signaling in Schwann cells, thereby derepressing the transcriptional program driven by Krox20/Egr2 to upregulate key adhesion molecules such as Neurofascin-155 and Caspr1. This cellular cascade is fundamental for the formation of septate junctions at nodes of Ranvier and for maintaining high-quality nerve conduction. While DAPT’s well-characterized pharmacology and the abundance of preclinical data in related contexts are strengths that favor its repurposing, its lack of absolute selectivity and the potential for systemic side effects remain key challenges that must be addressed in future studies. Comprehensive evaluation in rigorous and translational preclinical models—including detailed pharmacokinetic studies and assessments of peripheral nerve uptake—is warranted to fully validate DAPT as a promising therapeutic candidate for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (Monk et al., 2015; Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017; Nor, 2023).

In conclusion, DAPT represents a promising candidate for repurposing in the setting of demyelinating peripheral neuropathies such as CMT, primarily due to its clear mechanism of action in antagonizing Notch signaling—a pathway known to impede Schwann cell maturation. Its capacity to potentially relieve the repression on the Krox20/Egr2 transcriptional program and promote paranodal assembly is compelling. However, the transition from promising preclinical findings to a viable clinical therapy will require addressing the off-target toxicities associated with broad Notch inhibition, establishing an acceptable safety profile in the peripheral nervous system, and confirming efficacy in disease-relevant animal models and ultimately in clinical trials (Beher & Graham, 2005; Li et al., 2021; Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017). Further research that directly evaluates DAPT in models of CMT, including assessments of nerve conduction indices, paranodal assembly by electron microscopy, and long-term functional outcomes, is essential before progressing to human trials.
