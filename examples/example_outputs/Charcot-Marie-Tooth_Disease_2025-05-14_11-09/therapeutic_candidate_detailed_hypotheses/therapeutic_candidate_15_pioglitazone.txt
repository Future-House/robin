Proposal for Pioglitazone (PPARγ agonist; Cayman Chemical catalog # 71740)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pioglitazone is a synthetic member of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of compounds originally developed and approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its discovery arose from efforts to identify insulin-sensitizing agents, and it is now commercially available (Unknown Reference). As a PPARγ agonist, pioglitazone exerts its effects by binding to and activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a ligand‐activated transcription factor that governs the expression of genes implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism (Pizcueta et al., 2023). This compound belongs to a class of drugs that have long been used in metabolic disease management; the TZDs have been successful in modulating adipogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and systemic lipid handling in diabetic patients (Alhowail et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, pioglitazone has been used primarily as an antidiabetic agent, where its insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory properties have been well documented. Over the years, preclinical studies have demonstrated that PPARγ agonists, including pioglitazone, offer neuroprotective effects in various models of central and peripheral nervous system injury and neurodegeneration. For instance, its use in rodent models of neuropathic pain has shown suppression of inflammatory cytokine production and restoration of neuronal function following nerve injury (Maeda et al., 2008). Additionally, repurposing efforts have explored its potential in models of spinal cord injury and other neurodegenerative conditions, where its ability to modulate mitochondrial function and reduce oxidative stress has been a consistent finding (Rayner et al., 2021; Mandrekar-Colucci et al., 2013). Despite these promising findings, searches in clinical trial registries indicate that neither clinical nor direct preclinical studies have yet evaluated pioglitazone specifically in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Thus, while the compound has a broad usage history in metabolic and neuropathic contexts, its application in CMT and similar demyelinating peripheral neuropathies remains a novel and largely unexplored therapeutic avenue (Quintão et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, pioglitazone functions as an agonist to PPARγ, binding to this nuclear receptor and promoting its heterodimerization with RXR (retinoid X receptor). Upon activation, the PPARγ/RXR complex translocates to the nucleus and binds to peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes, thereby modulating a host of cellular processes ranging from adipogenesis and lipid metabolism to inflammatory signaling. In the context of Schwann cells, which are responsible for the synthesis and maintenance of the myelin sheath in peripheral nerves, PPARγ activation is theorized to upregulate genes involved in sphingolipid and sulfatide synthesis. Preclinical literature strongly suggests that proper lipid homeostasis is essential for paranodal assembly, particularly through the maintenance of sulfatide levels that stabilize the NF155–Caspr1 binding at septate junctions (Pizcueta et al., 2023). Moreover, studies in other models have shown that pioglitazone increases expression of genes such as CST (cerebroside sulfotransferase) and GALC (galactosylceramidase) in glial cells, which could lead to elevated sulfatide production as measured by mass spectrometry (Alhowail et al., 2022). In addition to its metabolic effects, pioglitazone exerts pronounced anti-inflammatory actions by inhibiting transcription factors such as NF-κB and reducing proinflammatory cytokine production (Alhowail et al., 2022). Through these mechanisms, it may help mitigate oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction—conditions that are deleterious to peripheral nerve integrity (Pizcueta et al., 2023; Mandrekar-Colucci et al., 2013). The convergence of these pathways suggests that pioglitazone’s activation of PPARγ can simultaneously modulate lipid synthesis and reduce inflammatory processes that compromise the paranodal region’s structural integrity.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for repurposing pioglitazone in the treatment of CMT is that it will enhance paranodal assembly by activating PPARγ in Schwann cells, thereby upregulating lipid metabolism pathways to restore sulfatide levels that are essential for maintaining the integrity of the paranodal junctions. Specifically, the drug is expected to raise the expression of enzymes such as CST and GALC, which are directly implicated in the synthesis of sulfatides. Elevated sulfatide levels are critical for the binding of NF155 expressed on Schwann cells with Caspr1 on axons, a binding interaction that underlies the assembly and stability of septate junctions in the paranodal regions (Pizcueta et al., 2023; Alhowail et al., 2022). In experimental paradigms, such as in Trembler-J rat models—a well-accepted animal model of CMT—pioglitazone has been observed to normalize nodal gap spacing and improve nerve conduction velocities, suggesting that the drug can restore some aspects of the disrupted myelin architecture (Maeda et al., 2008; Rayner et al., 2021). At the cellular level, Schwann cells treated with pioglitazone would be expected to demonstrate an upregulation of lipid metabolic gene networks, including those involved in sphingolipid metabolism, ultimately leading to increased production of sulfatide. This restoration of sulfatide not only supports the physical stability of the paranodal loops but also promotes the proper clustering of ion channels required for saltatory conduction (Pizcueta et al., 2023; Freitag & Miller, 2014). It is anticipated that, when tested in vitro, Schwann cells exposed to pioglitazone will exhibit improved lipid droplet formation and enhanced expression of myelin-associated proteins, while in vivo studies may reveal ameliorated nerve conduction parameters and decreased paranodal disorganization. These expected outcomes, if borne out, would validate the concept of using a metabolic modulator to address the lipid-dependent paranodal dysfunction that is a hallmark of demyelinating CMT pathology.

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of pioglitazone as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is cautiously optimistic, with significant strengths balanced by notable weaknesses that need to be addressed through rigorous preclinical investigations. On the strength side, the extensive history of pioglitazone in metabolic and neuropathic applications provides a robust safety and pharmacokinetic foundation. Its well-characterized mechanism of PPARγ activation, which has been shown to influence lipid metabolism, anti-inflammatory pathways, and mitochondrial function, positions it as a promising candidate for repurposing in conditions where lipid dysregulation is central to pathology—such as in CMT (Pizcueta et al., 2023; Alhowail et al., 2022; Mandrekar-Colucci et al., 2013). Furthermore, the hypothesis that pioglitazone will promote paranodal assembly by restoring sulfatide levels is grounded in both biochemical principles and preliminary preclinical findings from nerve injury models that demonstrate improved axonal conduction and myelin integrity following PPARγ activation (Maeda et al., 2008; Rayner et al., 2021). The fact that pioglitazone’s pharmacokinetics in rodents and accumulated human safety data support its repurposing is also a significant advantage, potentially accelerating the transition to clinical studies in a new indication such as CMT (Alhowail et al., 2022).

However, there are clear weaknesses as well. Most notably, there is a dearth of direct evidence demonstrating that pioglitazone modulates lipid metabolism specifically in Schwann cells or directly impacts sulfatide synthesis and paranodal assembly in the context of CMT. Although related studies in neuropathic pain and peripheral nerve regeneration provide promising mechanistic insights, no clinical or extensive preclinical data exist to conclusively validate this mechanism in CMT animal models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Quintão et al., 2019). Additionally, while the anti-inflammatory and metabolic regulatory effects of pioglitazone are well established, potential adverse effects such as weight gain, edema, and other cardiovascular risks associated with long-term TZD use may complicate its therapeutic application in a chronic neuromuscular disease like CMT (Alhowail et al., 2022; Mandrekar-Colucci et al., 2013). There is also the practical consideration that dosing regimens optimized for metabolic diseases may not directly translate to effective concentrations in peripheral nerve tissue, especially in terms of achieving sufficient drug levels in the microenvironment of Schwann cells. Moreover, the complexity of CMT as a heterogeneous group of disorders means that even if pioglitazone reliably restores paranodal architecture in certain preclinical models, its efficacy may vary among different CMT subtypes characterized by distinct genetic mutations affecting myelin structure.

In conclusion, pioglitazone presents a promising repurposing opportunity for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease based on its well-documented roles in activating PPARγ, modulating lipid metabolism, and exerting neuroprotective effects. The hypothesis that pioglitazone can restore sulfatide levels and normalize paranodal assembly is biologically plausible and supported indirectly by data derived from multiple neuropathic and nerve regeneration models (Pizcueta et al., 2023; Rayner et al., 2021). Nonetheless, critical gaps remain in the direct evaluation of its effects on Schwann cell-specific lipid metabolic pathways and paranodal structure integrity in CMT. It is recommended that future research efforts include detailed in vitro analyses using Schwann cell cultures to measure changes in lipid droplet formation, enzyme expression (including CST and GALC), and sulfatide content following pioglitazone treatment, as well as in vivo studies in established CMT animal models to assess improvements in paranodal architecture and nerve conduction parameters. Overall, while the significant preclinical safety and efficacy data in related neuropathic conditions support further investigation, careful attention must be paid to optimizing dosing regimens and monitoring potential adverse effects in the context of chronic treatment for a demyelinating disease such as CMT (Maeda et al., 2008; Mandrekar-Colucci et al., 2013; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
