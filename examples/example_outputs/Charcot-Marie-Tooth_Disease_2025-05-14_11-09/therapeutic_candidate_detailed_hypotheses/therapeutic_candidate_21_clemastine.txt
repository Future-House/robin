Proposal for Clemastine (mAChR antagonist; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # C4512)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Clemastine is a first‐generation antihistamine originally developed and marketed for the treatment of allergic conditions, and it is available from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog # C4512). Chemically, it is a small‐molecule agent belonging to the class of antimuscarinic compounds that block cholinergic receptors, most notably the M1 and M3 subtypes. Originally discovered through classical drug‐screening methods for antihistaminic activity, clemastine has since been repurposed based on its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and its observed promyelinating effects in various central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating models (Gingele & Stangel, 2020). As a synthetic compound, it has historically been used to alleviate allergic symptoms; its physicochemical properties, such as high oral bioavailability and favorable peripheral distribution, make it an attractive candidate for repurposing in neurological disorders. Its chemical structure allows it to interact with muscarinic receptors, and over the past decade, research has shown that antimuscarinic agents may indirectly modulate intracellular signaling pathways that promote remyelination and possibly nerve repair (Jiang et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Clemastine’s clinical history spans decades of use in allergic conditions, and its safety profile is well documented. More recently, preclinical data have supported its use as a remyelinating agent in CNS pathologies such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and peripheral nerve compression neuropathy. For example, studies have demonstrated its capacity to promote oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation, enhance myelin basic protein (MBP) expression, and improve functional outcomes in animal models of demyelination (Lee et al., 2021; Tong et al., 2022). Notably, clemastine has been investigated in phase II trials in relapsing MS patients, where improvements in electrophysiological markers such as visual evoked potentials were observed (Gingele & Stangel, 2020; Cree et al., 2018). A search of clinical trial registries for “Clemastine AND Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease” reveals no registered human trials specifically targeting this peripheral neuropathy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), although the preclinical rationale based on its remyelination-promoting properties in central models has raised interest for its evaluation in peripheral diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease.

Mechanism of Action:
Clemastine exerts its effects primarily through antagonism of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), with a particular preference for the M1 subtype. By competitively inhibiting these receptors, clemastine elevates intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, a phenomenon that has been linked with enhanced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling. IGF-1 is a key neurotrophic factor in both central and peripheral myelination processes. In Schwann cells—the peripheral myelinating cells—the blockade of mAChRs is hypothesized to relieve an inhibitory tone on IGF-1–dependent myelination pathways, thereby promoting the upregulation of myelin-related proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP) and, critically, Neurofascin-155 (NF155), which is essential for the formation and stability of paranodal septate junctions (Jiang et al., 2023). In vitro studies using Schwann–dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co-culture systems have reported that clemastine increases MBP and NF155 levels, suggesting that muscarinic receptor antagonism in Schwann cells can accelerate paranodal loop formation and proper contactin-associated protein clustering (Lee et al., 2021). Additionally, clemastine has been demonstrated to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathway in oligodendrocyte lineage cells (Tong et al., 2022), and similar signaling cascades are present in Schwann cells, where they regulate myelination. Furthermore, electrophysiological models in Trembler-J mice—a murine model of CMT—have shown that clemastine treatment improves nerve conduction velocity and narrows the nodal gap, which is indicative of improved paranodal junction integrity (Lee et al., 2021). There is also evidence suggesting that clemastine may potentiate additional cellular targets such as the P2X7 receptor, which could augment neuroprotective and remyelinating processes, although this action is less directly related to its primary muscarinic antagonism (Nörenberg et al., 2011).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis for CMT, clemastine is expected to enhance paranodal septate junction formation in peripheral nerves by antagonizing muscarinic receptors on Schwann cells. This antagonism is theorized to remove cAMP-dependent inhibition on IGF-1 signaling, leading to increased phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor (p-IGF1R) and subsequent upregulation of pro-myelinating factors. The upregulation of Neurofascin-155 is especially critical; NF155 is essential for proper paranodal junction formation and axo-glial communication, which in turn improves nerve conduction velocity. In the proposed assays, clemastine is anticipated to increase the expression of MBP and NF155 in Schwann-DRG co-cultures, and these molecular changes should be paralleled by a reduction in the nodal gap width, as observed via electrophysiological assays in Trembler-J mice models (Lee et al., 2021; Yamazaki & Ohno, 2025). Pharmacodynamic measurements in treated nerves are expected to confirm target engagement through increases in p-IGF1R levels. These outcomes translate into a scenario where remyelination and paranodal repair restore nerve conduction velocity closer to normal levels, potentially alleviating motor and sensory deficits present in CMT disease (Jiang et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Clemastine presents several notable strengths as a therapeutic candidate for repurposing in CMT. First, its long-established clinical use as an antihistamine ensures a robust safety profile, with manageable side effects and known pharmacokinetics, which favor its repositioning in a chronic demyelinating condition (Gingele & Stangel, 2020; Yamazaki & Ohno, 2025). Its proven ability to enhance remyelination in CNS models—evidenced by improvements in visual evoked potentials and electrophysiological parameters—supports the rationale that similar mechanisms could be harnessed to repair peripheral nerve myelin by targeting Schwann cells (Lee et al., 2021; Cree et al., 2018). Moreover, the hypothesis that muscarinic receptor antagonism elevates cAMP and thereby augments IGF-1 signaling is mechanistically sound, given the established role of IGF-1 in promoting Schwann cell-mediated myelination and paranodal junction formation (Jiang et al., 2023; Tong et al., 2022). Improvements in paranodal integrity, such as increased NF155 expression and restoration of compound action potentials, align with known pathophysiological deficits in CMT, offering functional benefits as evidenced in Trembler-J mouse models (Lee et al., 2021).

Nonetheless, several weaknesses or points of caution should be noted. Although clemastine has been extensively evaluated in CNS demyelination contexts, direct evidence regarding its effects on peripheral Schwann cells is relatively sparse, and no clinical trials have been registered that specifically target CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, some studies, particularly in developmental models, have reported that clemastine might impair aspects of myelination or alter glial cell interactions, suggesting that its effects can be context dependent (Palma et al., 2022). These findings underscore the need for careful dose optimization and evaluation of long-term effects, particularly in a peripheral neuropathy setting where Schwann cell biology differs from oligodendrocyte biology. Finally, while the hypothesized mechanism involving IGF-1 signaling and NF155 upregulation is promising, further detailed biochemical studies are required to unequivocally demonstrate that clemastine elicits these changes in Schwann cells in vivo (Jiang et al., 2023; Yamazaki & Ohno, 2025).

In summary, clemastine is a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for CMT based on its favorable pharmacological safety profile, oral bioavailability, and demonstrated efficacy in promoting remyelination in CNS models via muscarinic receptor antagonism. The expected enhancement of IGF-1 signaling and upregulation of key myelin-associated proteins such as Neurofascin-155 and MBP could translate into improved paranodal junction formation and nerve conduction in peripheral neuropathies. However, before proceeding to clinical trials for CMT, further rigorous preclinical studies are needed to validate its direct effects on Schwann cell biology and paranodal repair, to optimize dosing, and to ensure peripheral safety. Overall, while the preclinical evidence is encouraging and supports further investigation, the translational potential for CMT will depend on filling the existing gaps in our understanding of clemastine’s molecular effects in the peripheral nervous system (Gingele & Stangel, 2020; Bernis et al., 2024).
