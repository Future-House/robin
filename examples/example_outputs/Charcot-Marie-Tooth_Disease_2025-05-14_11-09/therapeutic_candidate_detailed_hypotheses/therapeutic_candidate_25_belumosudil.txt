Proposal for Belumosudil (SLX-2119; Cayman Chemical catalog # 22621)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Belumosudil (also known as SLX-2119 or KD025) is a synthetic, orally bioavailable small‐molecule inhibitor that belongs to the class of Rho‐associated coiled–coil–containing protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitors. It was discovered and optimized from high‐throughput screening programs targeting the Rho/ROCK pathway and subsequently advanced through preclinical and clinical development primarily for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). As a selective inhibitor of the ROCK2 isoform, belumosudil exhibits a very high potency against ROCK2 (with IC₅₀ values in the 60–110 nM range) and minimal activity against ROCK1 (greater than 10 μM), highlighting its isoform selectivity (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022). ROCK2 inhibitors constitute a therapeutic class that modulates cytoskeletal dynamics, cell adhesion, and gene transcription well known for their roles in fibrotic and inflammatory diseases. Historically, compounds of this class have shown promise in attenuating abnormal fibrotic processes and immunomodulation in conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, and cGVHD (Blair, 2021). The availability of an advanced clinical profile for belumosudil makes it an attractive candidate for rapid repurposing to other indications—in this case, Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease—where deficits in cytoskeletal regulation and cell junction integrity are implicated.

Therapeutic History:
Belumosudil has a well‐documented clinical history in the treatment of cGVHD. In clinical trials such as the phase 2 ROCKstar study, it demonstrated efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in adult and pediatric patients (aged ≥12 years) who had failed at least two prior lines of systemic therapy; its overall response rates in cGVHD studies ranged between 65% and 70% (Blair, 2021). The compound’s ability to attenuate inflammatory pathways by shifting the balance between proinflammatory Th17 cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) via modulation of STAT3 and STAT5 signaling has been central to its clinical success in cGVHD (Braun & Zeiser, 2021). Beyond cGVHD, belumosudil is being evaluated in other inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, including systemic sclerosis and psoriasis, due to its effects on fibrosis and immune modulation (Levien & Baker, 2022; Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022). Importantly, although belumosudil has not been directly evaluated in clinical trials for Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease (CMT) or other peripheral nerve disorders, a comprehensive search of the literature (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a) indicates significant investigative interest around the ROCK pathway in neuropathies. Preclinical studies with other ROCK inhibitors suggest potential benefits in nerve regeneration and stabilization of cellular junctions, providing foundational rationale to extend these findings to CMT (Tönges et al., 2011; Benarroch, 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
The underlying molecular mechanism of belumosudil is based on its highly selective inhibition of ROCK2, a serine‐threonine kinase that plays a decisive role in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell contractility, and cellular junction formation. ROCK2 phosphorylates multiple downstream substrates such as myosin light chain (MLC) and LIM kinase, resulting in the enhancement of actomyosin contractility and stabilization of actin filaments (Benarroch, 2023; Tönges et al., 2011). Inhibition of ROCK2 by belumosudil leads to reduced phosphorylation of MLC, thereby decreasing actomyosin contractility. This effect is critical in cell types that require fine‐tuning of cytoskeletal tension, such as Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. In the context of CMT, aberrant contractility in Schwann cells can interfere with the formation of proper septate (paranodal) junctions that are essential for effective nerve conduction. Preclinical data indicate that in ex vivo CMT1A nerve slices, belumosudil treatment reduces MLC phosphorylation and increases acetyl-α-tubulin levels, a marker associated with microtubule stabilization (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022). This biochemical effect is thought to facilitate the formation and maintenance of paranodal junction loops by allowing proper interactions between Caspr1 on the axonal membrane and Neurofascin 155 (NF155) on the Schwann cell, which are critical for septate (paranodal) junction formation (Benarroch, 2023). Furthermore, ROCK2 inhibition affects additional transcriptional regulators, such as serum response factor (SRF) and myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF), thereby influencing the expression of genes involved in cell differentiation and contractile protein assembly (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022). Such molecular cascades not only dampen fibrosis and inflammation—evident from its efficacy in cGVHD—but are also hypothesized to restore the specialized architecture of the paranodal region in peripheral nerves, thereby normalizing nerve conduction velocities.

Expected Effect:
Based on the preclinical hypothesis and supported by initial ex vivo and in vivo experiments, belumosudil is expected to restore paranodal junction integrity in CMT by several interconnected mechanisms. First, by selectively inhibiting ROCK2, belumosudil would reduce MLC phosphorylation in Schwann cells, leading to diminished actomyosin contractility. This reduction in cytoskeletal tension is hypothesized to permit the correct assembly of septate junction loops at the paranodal regions. Experimental evidence from ex vivo CMT1A nerve slice cultures indicates that treatment with belumosudil increases levels of acetyl-α-tubulin, suggesting enhanced stabilization of the microtubule network, which is necessary for the proper trafficking and localization of paranodal proteins (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022). Moreover, immunostaining analyses in these models have revealed improved localization of Caspr1 to paranodal regions, indicative of normalized Caspr1-NF155 interactions (Benarroch, 2023). Such restoration of molecular architecture is expected to lead to improved nerve conduction velocities, as assessed by electrophysiological methods, and ultrastructural normalization of nodal gap sizes observed via electron microscopy. Thus, the cumulative effect of reduced Schwann cell contractility, enhanced microtubule stabilization, and reestablishment of paranodal junction proteins should translate into functional improvements in peripheral nerve conduction in CMT models. While direct clinical evidence in CMT patients is lacking, the observed effects in ex vivo and in vivo studies provide a strong rationale for further development and clinical testing of belumosudil in demyelinating neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, belumosudil represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease based on its well‐characterized mechanism, favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles from its use in chronic graft-versus-host disease, and its potential to target key molecular pathways implicated in peripheral nerve pathology. One major strength of belumosudil is its high selectivity for ROCK2, which allows for specific modulation of cytoskeletal and junctional dynamics in Schwann cells—cells that are critical for the maintenance of myelin and the formation of paranodal junctions. The preclinical data demonstrating reduced MLC phosphorylation, increased acetyl-α-tubulin, and improved Caspr1 localization to paranodes support the hypothesis that belumosudil can restore the specialized septate junction architecture necessary for proper nerve conduction (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022; Benarroch, 2023). Furthermore, its oral bioavailability and established clinical safety in other indications (cGVHD, systemic sclerosis, and psoriasis) significantly streamline its potential repurposing timeline for CMT (Blair, 2021; Levien & Baker, 2022).

However, several weaknesses and challenges must be acknowledged as well. Despite the strong rationale at the mechanistic and biochemical levels, there is a current lack of direct preclinical or clinical trial evidence specifically addressing belumosudil's efficacy in CMT or other peripheral neuropathies. While initial ex vivo studies using CMT1A nerve slices are promising, these findings must be rigorously validated in robust in vivo animal models of CMT before translating to clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Additionally, given that ROCK signaling is involved in multiple cellular processes, off-target effects or alterations in signaling networks unrelated to myelination could arise, necessitating careful dose optimization and monitoring during any future clinical evaluation. Moreover, while the compound has been shown to modulate immune pathways favorably in cGVHD, the neurobiological environment of the peripheral nerve presents unique challenges, including the interplay with axonal transport and Schwann cell–specific functions, which might not be fully recapitulated by ROCK inhibition alone (Benarroch, 2023; Tönges et al., 2011).

Overall, the strengths of belumosudil lie in its selective ROCK2 inhibition, established clinical safety, and promising preclinical biomarker changes that support its ability to restore paranodal junctions by enhancing proper Caspr1-NF155 interactions. These characteristics make it a compelling candidate for repurposing in CMT. Nevertheless, additional dedicated preclinical studies using animal models of CMT and comprehensive clinical evaluations will be required to fully establish its efficacy and safety in the context of peripheral nervous system disorders. In conclusion, while belumosudil shows considerable promise as a therapeutic candidate for CMT based on its mechanistic rationale and supportive biochemical and ex vivo data, further research is needed to address the current gaps in direct evidence for its use in this application (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022; Braun & Zeiser, 2021; Levien & Baker, 2022).
