Proposal for Fingolimod (FTY720; Cayman Chemical catalog # 11040)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fingolimod (FTY720) is a synthetic sphingosine analogue initially discovered during research aimed at developing immunomodulatory agents for multiple sclerosis (MS). It belongs to the class of S1P (sphingosine‐1‐phosphate) receptor modulators. Following in vivo phosphorylation to the active metabolite FTY720‐phosphate, the compound binds with high affinity to several S1P receptor subtypes (most notably S1P1 and S1P3), inducing receptor internalization and degradation. This mechanism places Fingolimod among agents that both regulate immune cell trafficking and, importantly for our purposes, affect cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics and cell–cell interactions. The compound was synthesized through modifications of sphingosine to enhance its stability and bioavailability, and its discovery originated from efforts to modulate inflammatory responses in MS. Furthermore, as part of the immunomodulatory drug class, Fingolimod has demonstrated efficacy in MS by reducing peripheral lymphocyte egress, which leads to a decrease in central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory infiltration (Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, p. 13; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Fingolimod’s most extensive clinical history is as a disease-modifying therapy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. It was approved based on its significant immunosuppressive effects, which stem from its S1P receptor modulation and subsequent lymphocyte sequestration in lymph nodes. Preclinical studies, including those using animal models of autoimmune neuritis and demyelinating conditions, have shown that Fingolimod not only ameliorates inflammation but also exerts neuroprotective effects by promoting remyelination and neural repair (Ambrosius et al., 2017, pp. 1-2; Szepanowski et al., 2016, pp. 1-2). Its ability to improve conduction velocity and nerve conduction electrophysiology in rodent models of nerve injury further supports its potential in peripheral neuropathies (Kremer et al., 2019, p. 12; Szepanowski et al., 2016, p. 10). However, as of now, searches of clinical trial registries for Fingolimod in the context of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease or peripheral neuropathy have returned zero registered clinical trials, suggesting that the direct translation of Fingolimod for CMT remains uncharted territory at the clinical level (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). While several studies have evaluated its effects in models of peripheral nerve injury and autoimmune neuritis, a focused application in CMT or diseases with similar Schwann cell pathology has not been clinically pursued, although preclinical evidence in models such as rat sciatic nerve crush injury implies that modulation of S1P receptor signaling can enhance remyelination (Szepanowski et al., 2016, pp. 4-6).

Mechanism of Action:
Fingolimod’s activity is mediated through its phosphorylated form binding to S1P receptors, predominantly S1P1. This binding induces receptor internalization and a “functional antagonism” effect, which diminishes lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs and reduces peripheral immune cell availability (Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, p. 13; Miron et al., 2008, pp. 4-5). In addition to these immunomodulatory effects, the S1P1 receptor signaling cascade has important roles in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics. Activation of S1P1 on glial cells, including Schwann cells, facilitates migration, survival, and differentiation, and it has been implicated in the regulation of actin dynamics through downstream signaling pathways involving Rac1 and Cdc42 small GTPases. These molecules are central to actin remodeling—responsible for growth cone dynamics, filopodia formation, and cell adhesion—and are thereby integral to establishing and maintaining paranodal junctions, which are critical for axon–glial adhesion (Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, pp. 10-13; Ambrosius et al., 2017, p. 9). Furthermore, studies indicate that S1P receptor signaling can lead to upregulation of immediate early genes via a G12/13-RhoA-MRTF-A-SRF transcriptional cascade. This cascade is known to regulate the expression of actin cytoskeleton components and potentially other proteins relevant to paranodal integrity such as Neurofascin-155—a key adhesion molecule that stabilizes axoglial interactions near the nodes of Ranvier (Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, p. 17). Moreover, preclinical investigations in rodent peripheral nerve injury models have demonstrated that Fingolimod administration results in improved conduction velocities and restoration of nodal spacing, possibly by promoting remyelination as well as enhancing paranodal junction stability (Kremer et al., 2019, p. 12; Szepanowski et al., 2016, p. 10).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis is that Fingolimod will enhance paranodal junction stability in CMT by modulating S1P1 receptor signaling on Schwann cells. Given that S1P1 signaling is critical to Schwann cell survival, migration, and regulation of myelination, binding of Fingolimod’s phosphorylated form to S1P1 receptors on Schwann cells is expected to induce biased signaling. This biased signaling can lead to receptor internalization whereby the downstream effectors—particularly Rac1 and Cdc42—are activated, thereby promoting actin remodeling and cytoskeletal reorganization (Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, p. 13; Szepanowski et al., 2016, pp. 1-2). The upregulation of these pathways can facilitate the expression of proteins critical for maintaining paranodal junctions such as Neurofascin-155. Neurofascin-155, which is a crucial adhesion molecule localized at the paranodal loops of myelin, is essential for stabilizing axoglial interactions, and its upregulation could restore disrupted paranodal architecture seen in CMT (Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, pp. 10-13). Additionally, dose–response studies in rat sciatic nerve models have demonstrated improvements in conduction velocity and restoration of nodal spacing on electron microscopy following Fingolimod treatment, which supports the notion that this compound may help in re-establishing the proper paranodal structure (Kremer et al., 2019, p. 12; Szepanowski et al., 2016, pp. 10-11). Given Fingolimod’s oral bioavailability, predictable pharmacokinetic profile—including its distribution to peripheral nerves—and extensive clinical experience in MS patients, it is postulated that a similar dosing strategy could be effective in targeting Schwann cell dysfunction in CMT, promoting remyelination and enhancing axoglial adhesion through improved paranodal junction integrity (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, p. 17).

Overall Evaluation:
Fingolimod presents several attractive strengths as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. Its established clinical use in MS provides a robust safety profile over extended periods of use and its oral bioavailability, along with characterized pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, minimizes the uncertainty typically associated with new chemical entities. The molecular basis for its action—through S1P receptor modulation leading to downstream Rac1/Cdc42-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization and potential upregulation of Neurofascin-155—directly addresses mechanistic deficits implicated in CMT, where disrupted paranodal junctions and impaired Schwann cell function underlie demyelination and altered axoglial interactions (Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, p. 13; Ambrosius et al., 2017, p. 9).

On the other hand, there are significant weaknesses and gaps in knowledge. To date, there are no clinical trials specifically evaluating Fingolimod in CMT or direct studies assessing its effects on Schwann cell-specific properties in the peripheral nervous system (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although preclinical models of peripheral nerve injury have shown improved conduction and signs of remyelination, the translation of these findings to the heterogenous pathology of CMT remains an open question. Additionally, while Fingolimod’s effect on neuronal cytoskeletal reorganization and even oligodendrocyte processes is well documented in CNS contexts, evidence specifically delineating its role in Schwann cell-mediated Paranodal stability is still emerging (Szepanowski et al., 2016, p. 10; Kremer et al., 2019, p. 12).

There is also a potential risk that the immunomodulatory effects of Fingolimod, while beneficial in MS, could have unintended consequences in peripheral nerves if they alter the delicate balance required for Schwann cell function. Some preclinical studies indicate that higher doses of Fingolimod may impede Schwann cell-mediated myelination in vitro, which underscores the importance of carefully titrated dosing (Ambrosius et al., 2017, p. 9). Additionally, while activation of S1P1 signaling is hypothesized to increase Neurofascin-155 expression, direct evidence for upregulation of this molecule in response to Fingolimod in peripheral nerves is limited. Thus, critical validation studies are necessary to confirm that the anticipated upregulation of Neurofascin-155 and subsequent paranodal restoration occur in CMT models.

In summary, the repurposing of Fingolimod for CMT based on its molecular action on S1P1 receptors, promotion of cytoskeletal reorganization, and potential to enhance paranodal junction stability presents a promising yet unproven therapeutic avenue. Strengths include the extensive clinical data in MS, demonstrated peripheral nerve effects in preclinical models, and a clear mechanistic hypothesis aligning with Schwann cell biology (Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, p. 17; Szepanowski et al., 2016, pp. 1-2). However, weaknesses stem from the absence of direct clinical evidence in CMT, limited data on Neurofascin-155 upregulation in peripheral nerves, and potential off-target effects at higher concentrations. Overall, while there is a strong rationale to further explore Fingolimod’s use for improving paranodal junction stability and remyelination in CMT, additional preclinical investigations specifically assessing Schwann cell responses and paranodal marker expression are a prerequisite before moving into clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, p. 13; Kremer et al., 2019, p. 12).
