Proposal for CKD-504 (HDAC6 inhibitor; ChemDiv catalog # 05-2951)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
CKD-504 is a novel, highly selective synthetic inhibitor that targets histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), an enzyme predominantly localized in the cytoplasm that regulates the acetylation state of non-histone proteins such as α-tubulin and HSP90. The compound belongs to the hydroxamic acid subclass of HDAC inhibitors and has been designed to be CNS-penetrant, ensuring that it crosses the blood–brain barrier to effectively engage its target within both central and peripheral nerve tissues (Ha et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023). CKD-504 was synthesized with the intent to improve upon earlier HDAC6 inhibitors by achieving superior selectivity, optimal pharmacokinetics, and reduced systemic toxicity. As opposed to pan-HDAC inhibitors that affect nuclear histone acetylation and often lead to widespread off-target effects, CKD-504 displays robust specificity for HDAC6, which minimizes interference with histone acetylation and other nuclear processes, thereby reducing potential side effects (Ha et al., 2020; Benoy et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
HDAC6 inhibitors, as a class, have generated considerable interest in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and peripheral neuropathies because of their ability to enhance the acetylation of α-tubulin, thereby stabilizing microtubules and promoting intracellular transport. Previous studies have widely documented that selective inhibition of HDAC6 reversed axonal transport deficits and rescued neuromuscular function in preclinical models of neurodegeneration, including mutant models of Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and various forms of Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease (Ha et al., 2020; Benoy et al., 2017; Tavares et al., 2021). In Schwann cell–dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co-culture systems derived from CMT models, HDAC6 inhibitors have demonstrated the capacity to rescue myelination deficits while increasing axonal transport velocities and acetyl-α-tubulin levels, correlating with improved axoglial and paranodal architecture. Although CKD-504 itself has been primarily evaluated in neurodegenerative contexts such as Huntington’s disease models, where it reduced pathogenic protein aggregation and improved motor outcomes, its mechanistic properties suggest a potential repurposing for CMT therapies (Ha et al., 2020; Morena et al., 2019). Phase I safety data and preclinical PK/PD studies from related studies with CNS-penetrant HDAC6 inhibitors support further investigation of CKD-504 in CMT, though to date direct clinical applications in CMT or similar peripheral neuropathies have not been fully reported (Ha et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, CKD-504 exerts its therapeutic effect through selective inhibition of HDAC6’s deacetylase activity. HDAC6 normally deacetylates several non-histone substrates such as α-tubulin and HSP90. Inhibition of HDAC6 by CKD-504 results in increased levels of acetylated α-tubulin, a post-translational modification that directly correlates with microtubule stabilization. Stable microtubules facilitate the correct binding and processivity of motor proteins like kinesin-1 and dynein, which are responsible for anterograde and retrograde transport, respectively, along axons (Ha et al., 2020; Benoy et al., 2017). This enhanced axonal transport is crucial for the delivery of critical cargo, including mitochondria, synaptic vesicles, and proteins involved in myelination such as the paranodal proteins Caspr1 and Contactin-1. The clustering of these proteins at paranodal junctions is essential for maintaining axoglial integrity and proper node of Ranvier assembly, ultimately ensuring effective saltatory conduction (Ha et al., 2020; English & Barton, 2021).
In addition to its role in regulating microtubule dynamics, HDAC6 inhibition by CKD-504 may indirectly modulate the activity of molecular chaperones, such as boosting HSP70 expression through the acetylation of HSP90. This cascade of events contributes to improved proteostasis by reducing pathological protein aggregation—in the context of CMT1A, for example, by lowering PMP22 aggregates—and facilitates proper cellular responses to misfolded proteins (Ha et al., 2020; Benoy et al., 2017). Moreover, by facilitating axonal transport and ensuring the efficient delivery of paranodal constituents, HDAC6 inhibition supports the structural restoration of axoglial junctions. While direct experimental evidence on the modulation of paranodal protein clustering by CKD-504 is emerging, indirect support from related HDAC6 inhibitors that show normalized paranodal architecture in Schwann cell and DRG models buttresses the hypothesis that CKD-504 will have similar effects (Ha et al., 2020; Benoy et al., 2017; Morena et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assays employing Schwann cell–dorsal root ganglion co-cultures that model Charcot–Marie–Tooth pathology, the administration of CKD-504 is expected to produce several beneficial effects. First, by selectively inhibiting HDAC6, CKD-504 should result in a significant increase in acetyl-α-tubulin levels within the peripheral nerve and Schwann cell cytoplasm (Ha et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023). This biochemical change will stabilize microtubules and enhance the intracellular transport of organelles and proteins. The stabilization is hypothesized to facilitate the efficient delivery and proper localization of critical paranodal proteins such as Caspr1 and Contactin-1 to their native clusters at the node/paranode interface, which in turn will support the reformation of the nodal domain and restoration of axoglial integrity (Ha et al., 2020; English & Barton, 2021).
Second, improved axonal transport is expected to enhance mitochondrial motility and overall axonal health, which are compromised in CMT due to defective microtubule dynamics. Enhanced transport will likely result in improved electrophysiological parameters, measured by increases in motor nerve conduction velocity and compound muscle action potential amplitudes as observed in preclinical models treated with selective HDAC6 inhibitors (Benoy et al., 2017; Ha et al., 2020). Additionally, by reducing the accumulation of pathological protein aggregates such as PMP22 in the case of CMT1A, CKD-504 may contribute to a favorable shift in the proteostasis environment within Schwann cells, potentially leading to a normalization of myelin thickness and internodal length (Ha et al., 2020; Morena et al., 2019).
Finally, in animal models, these cellular and molecular improvements are expected to translate into functional benefits such as enhanced motor coordination, improved grip strength, and better behavioral outcomes as measured by rotarod and balance beam tests in transgenic mouse models of CMT (Ha et al., 2020; Benoy et al., 2017). These endpoints provide a strong translational rationale for CKD-504’s further development as a therapeutic candidate for CMT.

Overall Evaluation:
CKD-504 emerges as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease based on its robust biochemical, preclinical, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Its major strengths include its high potency and selectivity towards HDAC6, ensuring that it specifically targets the deacetylation of α-tubulin and relevant cytoplasmic substrates without significantly interfering with nuclear histone acetylation (Ha et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023). This selectivity is critical because it minimizes potential off-target effects that have historically burdened other classes of HDAC inhibitors and contributes to a favorable safety profile, as supported by existing Phase I data and preclinical safety evaluations (Ha et al., 2020; Shen & Kozikowski, 2020).
Moreover, the mechanistic rationale behind CKD-504’s use in CMT is compelling. By increasing acetyl-α-tubulin levels, CKD-504 stabilizes microtubules, thereby enhancing axonal transport processes that are disrupted in CMT. Improved axonal transport is not only essential for the effective delivery of mitochondria, vesicles, and other critical organelles but also for ensuring the proper trafficking and clustering of paranodal proteins such as Caspr1 and Contactin-1. These proteins are essential for maintaining the integrity of the axoglial junctions and for preserving the nodal architecture required for efficient nerve conduction (Ha et al., 2020; English & Barton, 2021).
A further strength lies in the accumulating preclinical evidence from various HDAC6 inhibitors, which consistently show rescue of axonal transport deficits and improvements in myelination in models of peripheral neuropathy and neurodegenerative disease (Benoy et al., 2017; Morena et al., 2019). These observations strongly support the hypothesis that CKD-504 will not only ameliorate defective axonal transport but also foster the proper assembly of paranodal protein clusters, thereby restoring axoglial integrity and promoting nerve repair.
Nonetheless, some weaknesses and uncertainties remain. Direct data regarding CKD-504’s effects on the clustering of paranodal proteins such as Caspr1 and Contactin-1 are still preliminary, and further detailed mechanistic studies are needed to confirm that its modulation of microtubule acetylation translates into restored paranodal architecture in vivo (Ha et al., 2020). In addition, although the candidate has demonstrated promising CNS penetration and target engagement in related neurodegenerative models, comprehensive safety data specific to prolonged administration in CMT models need to be gathered to ensure its long-term tolerability, especially given the chronic nature of CMT (Ha et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
Further clinical trial data will be necessary to determine whether the improvements observed in biomarker endpoints, such as increased acetyl-α-tubulin levels and improved axonal transport, will translate into meaningful clinical benefits in CMT patients. The promising preclinical PK/PD profile and the existing safety data from Phase I studies provide a solid foundation, yet rigorous clinical testing in well-designed trials will be essential to conclusively establish efficacy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Regenacy Pharmaceuticals LLC, 2020).
In summary, CKD-504 displays an excellent balance of pharmacological activity, target specificity, and brain penetration that makes it a strong candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. The underlying hypothesis that CKD-504 will improve axoglial integrity in CMT by enhancing microtubule-based transport and promoting the proper localization of paranodal proteins is well supported by current biochemical and preclinical evidence (Ha et al., 2020; Benoy et al., 2017; Morena et al., 2019). While further work is needed to directly evaluate its effects on paranodal protein clustering and long-term clinical outcomes, the strengths of this candidate outweigh the potential limitations, and CKD-504 warrants continued development and clinical investigation as a novel therapeutic approach for CMT.
