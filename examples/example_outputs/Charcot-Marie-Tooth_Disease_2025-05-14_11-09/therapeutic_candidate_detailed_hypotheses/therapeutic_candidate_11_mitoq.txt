Proposal for MitoQ (mitoquinone; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # SML0737)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MitoQ (mitoquinone; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # SML0737) is a synthetic, mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant derived from coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone). Chemically, MitoQ is composed of a ubiquinone moiety covalently linked to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) cation, which was designed to promote selective accumulation in mitochondria driven by the negative membrane potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This design enables the drug to localize its antioxidant activity directly at the site where reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced, thus enhancing its therapeutic efficacy over conventional untargeted antioxidants. The molecule belongs to the class of mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants, a category of compounds that has been developed based on the rationale of neutralizing oxidative damage in disorders where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role. Historically, the focused approach of targeting antioxidants to the mitochondria has been pursued in various clinical and preclinical settings including neurodegenerative conditions, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders, with the aim of mitigating mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and cellular oxidative stress (Bottani et al., 2020; Fields et al., 2023). The synthesis of MitoQ involves chemical modifications of naturally occurring CoQ10 derivatives to facilitate passage through biological membranes and ensure that the molecule reaches the mitochondrial matrix, where it is recycled into its active, reduced antioxidant form through the activity of mitochondrial succinate–CoQ reductase. Its ability to rapidly integrate into mitochondrial membranes and exert a continuous ROS scavenging function has been a major impetus behind its evaluation as an intervention for diseases characterized by redox imbalance (Fields et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
MitoQ has a relatively extensive history of evaluation in both preclinical and clinical settings. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated that MitoQ is capable of reducing oxidative damage and preserving mitochondrial function in various disease models including Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and even cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury (Oliver & Reddy, 2019; Bottani et al., 2020). Clinical trials have been undertaken to assess the safety and efficacy of MitoQ in human subjects for conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, where it was evaluated for its neuroprotective properties, and in a Phase I trial for fatigue in multiple sclerosis, which reported a favorable safety profile though with mixed efficacy outcomes (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018). In addition, a series of 40 clinical trials indicates that there is ongoing interest in evaluating the efficacy of mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants in a range of neuropathic and mitochondrial dysfunction conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, despite the robust evaluation of MitoQ in central nervous system (CNS) diseases and other neurodegenerative models, the explicit clinical testing of MitoQ in Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease (CMT) or related peripheral neuropathies remains limited. Preclinical studies in similar paradigms, particularly in experimental models featuring mitochondrial dysfunction, have shown that targeted antioxidants like MitoQ may benefit neuronal and glial populations by preserving oxidative homeostasis; yet no direct clinical trial data exists for CMT as of the current literature (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Bottani et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, MitoQ’s mechanism of action is centered on its ability to selectively accumulate in mitochondria and function as an ROS scavenger. The triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) group incorporated into its structure takes advantage of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential, concentrating MitoQ several-hundred-fold relative to the cytosol. Once inside the mitochondria, the ubiquinone component of MitoQ is reduced to its active form, ubiquinol (MitoQH₂), by enzymes in the electron transport chain such as succinate–CoQ reductase. In its reduced state, MitoQH₂ acts akin to the natural antioxidant CoQ10 by donating electrons to neutralize reactive oxygen species, particularly lipid peroxyl radicals and other reactive oxygen intermediates that can damage mitochondrial membranes, proteins, and mitochondrial DNA. This redox cycling allows MitoQ to repeatedly quench ROS without being consumed, thereby preventing the onset of cascading oxidative damage (Fields et al., 2023; Kasote et al., 2013). Furthermore, mechanistic studies in animal models have highlighted that MitoQ can stabilize mitochondrial dynamics by modulating the expression of key proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion and fission. For instance, in dopaminergic neuron models using toxins like 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), MitoQ was shown to enhance mitochondrial fusion through upregulation of Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) via activation of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, thereby preserving mitochondrial integrity and function (Xi et al., 2018). Mfn2 itself is critical because mutations in this protein are known to cause a subtype of CMT (CMT2A), linking mitochondrial dynamics directly to peripheral nerve pathology. Thus, MitoQ’s biochemical actions encompass direct ROS scavenging, prevention of lipid peroxidation, stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential, and regulation of mitochondrial dynamics that are essential for neuronal bioenergetics and survival (Fields et al., 2023; Apostolova & Victor, 2015). Notably, while many studies have focused on MitoQ’s capacity to protect central neurons, the underlying biochemical principles suggest that similar protective mechanisms could be operative in Schwann cells, which also rely heavily on mitochondrial function for myelination and maintenance of axoglial architecture (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rodríguez et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
The specific hypothesis for CMT posits that MitoQ will protect paranodal junctions by scavenging mitochondrial ROS in both Schwann cells and neurons, thereby preventing oxidative damage to key adhesion molecules such as Caspr1 and NF155 and preserving the organization of the nodal gap. In proposed assays—whether in vitro in MFN2 mutant neuron-Schwann cocultures or in in vivo rodent models of CMT—MitoQ is expected to restore impaired ATP production, reduce oxidative stress markers, and maintain the expression and proper localization of paranodal cell adhesion molecules. Such outcomes would be reflected in improved electrophysiological nerve conduction and restoration of nodal architecture as assessed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analyses targeting paranodal molecular components (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rodríguez et al., 2022). Experimental data from similar paradigms, though not directly in CMT models, have indicated that MitoQ can augment mitochondrial bioenergetics in muscle and neuronal tissues. For example, in MFN2 mutant models where mitochondrial dynamics are disrupted, MitoQ treatment has been shown to lower levels of oxidative stress markers and upregulate ATP production, which is essential for cellular function and integrity in energy‐demanding cells such as myelinating Schwann cells (Leitão-Rocha et al., 2015; Miquel et al., 2014). Given that Schwann cells express a complement of mitochondrial proteins and are particularly susceptible to oxidative damage when their mitochondria are compromised, targeting these organelles with MitoQ could potentially stabilize the paranodal junctions—critical regions that require high energy levels for the synthesis and maintenance of adhesion molecules like Caspr1 and NF155. Moreover, the drug’s documented pharmacokinetic profile in rodents indicates efficient peripheral nerve uptake and a favorable tolerability profile, reinforcing the likelihood that sufficient drug levels can be achieved in the peripheral nervous system to exert these biochemical benefits (Almikhlafi et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, MitoQ emerges as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, based on several converging lines of evidence. The strengths of MitoQ stem from its distinctive design as a mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant that not only neutralizes reactive oxygen species but also modulates mitochondrial dynamics by influencing key proteins such as Mfn2. This is particularly relevant given that mutations in Mfn2 are directly implicated in CMT2A, a common subtype of CMT. Preclinical studies in models of neurodegenerative diseases have demonstrated that the reduction of mitochondrial oxidative stress can lead to improvements in cellular bioenergetics, preservation of neuronal and muscular function, and enhanced cell survival, all of which are pertinent to the pathophysiology of CMT in which both Schwann cells and neurons are compromised (Oliver & Reddy, 2019; Xi et al., 2018).

Another considerable strength is the favorable safety profile of MitoQ, as evidenced by several clinical trials in neurological conditions and other contexts. The phase I safety data combined with rodent pharmacokinetic studies showing efficient uptake in peripheral nerves suggest that MitoQ can achieve the requisite tissue levels to exert a therapeutic effect in CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; Almikhlafi et al., 2023). Additionally, the preclinical validation in models where MitoQ helped restore mitochondrial ATP production and reduce oxidative stress markers further supports the hypothesis that similar benefits could be observed in MFN2 mutant neuron-Schwann cell cocultures—a key experimental model for CMT pathology (Bottani et al., 2020).

However, there are some weaknesses and uncertainties that must be considered. The major shortcoming of the current evidence base is the lack of direct preclinical or clinical studies evaluating MitoQ specifically in models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease or peripheral neuropathy. Most published data focus on central nervous system disorders, and while mitochondrial dysfunction is a common denominator, it is not a given that the mechanisms and outcomes will translate seamlessly to peripheral nerves and Schwann cells. In particular, the direct effects of MitoQ on the maintenance of paranodal junctions—specifically the preservation of adhesion molecules like Caspr1 and NF155—have not been comprehensively demonstrated. While the biochemical rationale is strong, definitive studies addressing these endpoints through immunoblot analysis or immunohistochemistry in CMT models are currently lacking (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rodríguez et al., 2022).

Additionally, while modulation of mitochondrial dynamics via Mfn2 upregulation is a compelling aspect of MitoQ’s mechanism, the precise dose-response relationship and the narrow therapeutic window observed in some in vitro experiments (e.g., in neuronal cell cultures) suggest that careful titration will be necessary to avoid potential toxicity (Oliver & Reddy, 2019). Moreover, differences in mitochondrial membrane potential between central neurons and peripheral Schwann cells might influence the regional uptake and efficacy of MitoQ, a factor that needs to be addressed in future pharmacodynamic studies (Fields et al., 2023).

Despite these concerns, the overall balance of evidence supports further investigation into MitoQ as a repurposed therapeutic for CMT. Its targeted mechanism to scavenge mitochondrial ROS, potential to stabilize mitochondrial dynamics through Mfn2 upregulation, and ability to preserve cellular energy production and structural integrity in high-energy-demand cells are all highly relevant to the molecular pathology of CMT. Given that mitochondrial dysfunction and redox imbalance are recognized contributors to axoglial disjunction and demyelination in CMT, MitoQ’s mode of action addresses the underlying pathology rather than merely symptomatic relief (Xi et al., 2018; Apostolova & Victor, 2015).

In conclusion, MitoQ presents several attractive features as a candidate therapeutic for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. Its chemical design allows targeted mitochondrial delivery, it has a well-characterized mechanism involving ROS scavenging and modulation of key mitochondrial fusion proteins, and preclinical data in neurodegenerative models indicate that similar protective effects—such as improved ATP production, reduced oxidative stress, and preservation of cell adhesion molecules—are achievable. However, given the current gaps in direct evidence for peripheral nerve effects and the need for more robust preclinical studies specifically delineating its impact on Schwann cells and paranodal junction integrity, further rigorous evaluation is warranted. The next steps should include designing targeted preclinical studies using MFN2 mutant neuron-Schwann cell coculture systems and rodent models of CMT to assess endpoints such as oxidative stress markers, preservation of axoglial junctions (Caspr1, NF155 expression), and improvements in nerve conduction. With these data, we can then better determine whether MitoQ warrants progression into clinical trials for CMT. Overall, while the scientific rationale is strong and the initial evidence is encouraging, additional focused research is necessary to confirm MitoQ’s therapeutic potential in this specific context (Bottani et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Fields et al., 2023).
