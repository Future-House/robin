Proposal for Valproic Acid (HDAC inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # P4543)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Valproic acid (VPA; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # P4543) is a synthetic, small-molecule drug originally discovered in the 1960s as an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer. It is structurally a branched short-chain fatty acid and belongs to a class of compounds that serve as broad-spectrum histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), targeting Zn²⁺-dependent HDACs from classes I, II, and IV. This compound was synthesized via chemical modifications of valeric acid and has moved beyond its initial epilepsy indications to be investigated in various neurological contexts. Historically, the class of HDAC inhibitors—including promising agents in oncology, neurodegeneration, and nerve repair—has been shown to modulate gene transcription via enhancing acetylation of histones and nonhistone proteins, thereby altering chromatin architecture and promoting expression of regeneration-associated genes (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). The potential of such compounds in modulating epigenetic regulation in peripheral tissues has driven interest in repurposing VPA for diseases such as Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease, where demyelination and defective paranodal junctions are central to pathophysiology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Valproic acid has a long history of clinical use in humans; it is approved for the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and migraine prophylaxis. Its extensive use in these conditions—supported by decades of safety data and practical clinical experience—has established VPA as a well-characterized molecule with consistent pharmacokinetic behavior and established oral bioavailability. Beyond its central nervous system indications, preclinical studies have explored VPA for neuroprotective and nerve regeneration roles. In animal models, VPA has been applied via conduits in sciatic nerve injury and demonstrated comparable regeneration to autograft techniques, suggesting potential utility in peripheral nerve repair (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). Furthermore, a search of ClinicalTrials.gov using the query “valproic acid AND Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease OR HDAC inhibitor AND peripheral neuropathy” identified eight clinical trials, underscoring ongoing investigations into HDAC inhibitors for peripheral neuropathies; however, none of these trial records have yet provided conclusive evidence on direct molecular effects of VPA on CMT-specific endpoints (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Notably, while the literature shows evolving interest in HDAC inhibition as a strategy to modulate Schwann cell biology and promote remyelination, VPA has not been extensively evaluated in clinical trials specifically for CMT; rather, most published evidence is preclinical or extrapolated from other peripheral neuropathy contexts (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 17–18).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of valproic acid as an HDAC inhibitor is multifaceted. At the molecular level, VPA inhibits the Zn²⁺-dependent histone deacetylases, thereby increasing acetylation marks on histones such as H3K9. This increased acetylation relaxes chromatin structure and promotes transcriptional activation of genes critical for myelination and nerve repair. In Schwann cells, the acetylation status of chromatin regulates key transcription factors such as Early Growth Response 2 (Egr2, also known as Krox20) and structural proteins including Neurofascin-155 (NF155), which are essential for the formation and maintenance of paranodal junctions. Preclinical models indicate that pharmacological inhibition of HDACs in Schwann cells may lead to upregulation of myelin-related genes by increasing histone acetylation at their promoter regions (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). More specifically, studies using HDAC inhibitors have demonstrated that when the activity of enzymes such as HDAC2 is reduced, there is an associated increase in the expression of transcription factors that drive myelin gene expression, including Egr2 and other factors associated with paranodal architecture. Although direct data linking VPA-mediated chromatin acetylation to increased Egr2 or NF155 expression in Schwann cells is limited in the current literature, the biological rationale is supported by evidence illustrating that HDAC inhibition broadly promotes a transcriptional environment conducive to remyelination and nerve repair (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 6–8; pp. 19–21). Additionally, nonhistone proteins such as components of the paranodal junctions might also be subject to regulatory acetylation changes that enhance stabilization of the nodal architecture. Thus, by increasing histone and possibly nonhistone acetylation, VPA may exert a dual mode of action: promoting the transcription of myelin gene promoters and stabilizing protein complexes essential for paranodal junction formation.

Expected Effect:
In the specific context of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the hypothesis is that VPA will promote paranodal junction formation by enhancing histone acetylation within Schwann cells. The expected cascade is as follows: with VPA’s broad-spectrum HDAC inhibition, there is increased H3K9 acetylation at the promoters of genes such as Egr2 and Neurofascin-155. This acetylation change is anticipated to upregulate mRNA and protein expression levels of these critical molecules, which in turn play pivotal roles in establishing the paranodal architecture necessary for efficient nerve conduction. For instance, Egr2 is a key transcription factor that has been implicated in the regulation of myelin protein genes during Schwann cell differentiation; upregulation of Egr2 would drive Schwann cells toward a myelinating phenotype, potentially correcting the demyelination observed in CMT (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). Similarly, Neurofascin-155 serves as a cell adhesion molecule at the paranodal junctions, and its increased expression should theoretically reinforce the septate junctions that are necessary for maintaining axon-glia interactions and proper nerve conduction velocities. In Trembler-J dorsal root ganglia coculture models, improved paranodal loop formation and increased conduction velocities have been observed with HDAC inhibitor treatment, supporting the notion that VPA could exert similar beneficial effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, it is noteworthy that the literature excerpts consistently indicate that while there is strong mechanistic rationale, direct experimental evidence explicitly demonstrating that VPA increases NF155 or Egr2 and concomitantly enhances paranodal structure formation in vivo or in vitro remains limited (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 19–21; TAS of Neurochemistry, 2021, pp. 130–132). The expected effect is thus a correction of the underlying demyelinating phenotype in CMT, achieved through transcriptional reprogramming of Schwann cells toward a regenerative, remyelinating state, with subsequent improvements in peripheral nerve conduction properties.

Overall Evaluation:
Valproic acid presents several strengths as a candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. Its long-term clinical use in epilepsy and bipolar disorder provides an extensive safety and pharmacokinetic profile, which is advantageous when considering drug repurposing, especially for diseases where drug development costs and timelines are significant concerns (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 10–11; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The mechanism of action—broad-spectrum HDAC inhibition leading to increased chromatin acetylation—is well established in the literature and is known to affect critical gene regulatory pathways in Schwann cell biology; this includes potential upregulation of transcription factors such as Egr2 and structural proteins like Neurofascin-155 that are essential for paranodal junction formation (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 6–8; pp. 19–21). Additionally, the preclinical evidence from peripheral nerve injury models, where VPA has been used to enhance nerve regeneration and improve conduction velocities, indirectly supports the hypothesis for its application in CMT (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 10–11; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, there are notable challenges and weaknesses in this therapeutic strategy. First, VPA is a broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitor, which means that its lack of specificity might lead to off-target effects and undesirable side effects, particularly when administered over long durations or at doses required for modulating peripheral nerve repair. The broad inhibition could interfere with other HDAC-mediated pathways that are crucial in non-target tissues and even in Schwann cells themselves, potentially leading to adverse effects such as altered cell proliferation or unwanted changes in immune responses (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 17–18; p. 22). Second, the current body of evidence does not provide direct experimental demonstration of VPA specifically upregulating NF155 or Egr2 expression in Schwann cells, nor does it show its direct effect on paranodal junction assembly in controlled in vitro or in vivo models of CMT. The hypothesis is compelling but requires further mechanistic validation—ideally using models such as Trembler-J dorsal root ganglia cocultures or genetically engineered mouse models of CMT—before proceeding to clinical investigations (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 19–21; TAS of Neurochemistry, 2021, pp. 130–132). Third, although clinical trials with HDAC inhibitors in various forms of peripheral neuropathy are underway, there remains uncertainty regarding appropriate dosing, duration, and potential interactions when repurposing VPA for CMT, a disease that primarily affects peripheral myelination rather than central neuronal circuits (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In summary, the overall evaluation of valproic acid as a therapeutic candidate for CMT highlights its potential, based on its established clinical safety profile, mechanistic rationale via HDAC inhibition, and supportive preclinical evidence from related models of peripheral nerve regeneration. Its strengths include oral bioavailability, extensive historical data in human use, and a plausible mechanism by which it could enhance Schwann cell function and paranodal junction formation. Nonetheless, significant gaps remain in directly linking VPA to increased expression of paranodal junction components such as Neurofascin-155 and the transcription factor Egr2, and in demonstrating that such modulation translates into improved nerve conduction and clinical outcomes in CMT models. Further targeted preclinical studies—including dose-response experiments, molecular validation of gene expression changes in Schwann cells, and rigorous electrophysiological assessments—are necessary to definitively determine its efficacy for CMT before advancing to controlled clinical trials (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 10–11; McMorrow et al., 2022, pp. 12–14; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall, while VPA holds promise as a repurposed drug candidate for CMT due to its capacity to modulate chromatin acetylation and promote a regenerative transcriptional profile in Schwann cells, further comprehensive experimental evidence is required to validate the specific hypothesis of paranodal junction formation enhancement via upregulation of Egr2 and Neurofascin-155. Strengths include its proven clinical track record and plausible mechanistic effects on myelin gene transcription, whereas weaknesses stem from its broad HDAC inhibition profile and the current lack of direct data in appropriate CMT models. Continued investigation and targeted mechanistic studies will be critical to confirm its utility and optimize its application in treating Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 17–18; pp. 19–21; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
