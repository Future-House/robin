Proposal for TUDCA (tauroursodeoxycholic acid; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # T0261)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is a bile acid derivative that naturally originates as the taurine‐conjugated form of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Initially discovered in the bile of bears and employed in traditional Chinese medicine, TUDCA is now synthesized by the chemical conjugation of UDCA with taurine, enabling large‐scale production for pharmaceutical applications (Kusaczuk, 2019). Belonging to a class of hydrophilic bile acids, TUDCA is traditionally used as a hepatoprotective and choleretic agent as well as a chemical chaperone that modulates the unfolded protein response (UPR), thereby reducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Kusaczuk, 2019; Khalaf et al., 2022). This class of compounds has historically been well known for its utility in treating cholestatic liver diseases, where they improve bile flow and protect hepatocytes, and recent investigations have expanded their role into neuroprotection based on their ability to stabilize protein folding and mitigate cellular stress (Jia, 2009; Kusaczuk, 2019).

Therapeutic History:
In terms of therapeutic history, TUDCA has been extensively used in the context of hepatobiliary diseases. It is used clinically in some European countries and in China for conditions such as primary biliary cirrhosis and cholesterol gallstones (Jia, 2009; Kusaczuk, 2019). Over the past decade, there has been growing interest in repurposing TUDCA for neurodegenerative conditions because of its potent anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and ER stress-reducing properties; clinical trials have been conducted in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in experimental models of Huntington’s and Parkinson’s diseases (Albanese, 2008; Khalaf et al., 2022; Boatright et al., 2019). Although there are no formal clinical trials specifically targeting Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) to date, several preclinical studies and exploratory clinical investigations in related neuropathic conditions suggest that TUDCA’s mechanistic actions may prove beneficial for demyelinating diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kusaczuk, 2019). Moreover, veterinary applications of bile acids have been reported in liver diseases of companion animals, though formal approval for neuropathies in either human or veterinary contexts remains investigational (Goland, 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of TUDCA’s action involves its role as a chemical chaperone that alleviates ER stress by enhancing the proper folding of proteins, thus mitigating the unfolded protein response (UPR) and preventing the activation of pro-apoptotic pathways such as CHOP-dependent cascades (Kusaczuk, 2019). In addition, TUDCA exerts a robust anti-apoptotic effect by stabilizing mitochondrial membranes; it prevents mitochondrial permeability transition, reduces cytochrome c release, and inhibits caspase-3 activation, thereby reducing apoptosis in stressed cells (Ackerman & Gerhard, 2016; Chen et al., 2022). These molecular actions include modulation of key signaling pathways such as Akt, MAPK, and PI3K, which are essential for cell survival under stress conditions (Khalaf et al., 2022). Importantly, in Schwann cells—whose dysfunction is central to CMT pathology—ER stress and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis impair the maturation and surface trafficking of critical cell adhesion molecules, notably septate junction proteins like neurofascin 155 (NF155) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kusaczuk, 2019). Preclinical models using MPZ mutant Schwann cell lines have shown that TUDCA treatment leads to reduced caspase-3 activation and restored NF155 surface expression, underscoring its ability to normalize the trafficking of adhesion molecules required for paranodal junction integrity (Kusaczuk, 2019; Khalaf et al., 2022). Furthermore, experimental data in Trembler-J mice—a well-established model for CMT—indicate that TUDCA improves nerve conduction velocity and restores paranodal loop electron density as observed by electron microscopy, which strongly suggests a preservation of paranodal junction architecture (Boatright et al., 2019; Khalaf et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
Based on the proposed hypothesis, TUDCA is expected to exert a therapeutic effect in CMT by restoring the integrity of paranodal junctions in peripheral nerves. This effect is primarily achieved through the reduction of ER stress and mitochondrial apoptosis in Schwann cells, thereby fostering correct folding and enhanced surface targeting of septate junction proteins like NF155 (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kusaczuk, 2019). In vitro assays using MPZ mutant Schwann cell lines have demonstrated that TUDCA treatment decreases caspase-3 activation—a marker of cellular apoptosis—and concurrently increases the surface expression of NF155, as measured by immunoblot analyses of cell surface fractions (Chen et al., 2022; Kusaczuk, 2019). In in vivo rodent models such as the Trembler-J mouse, TUDCA administration has been documented to lead to improved nerve conduction as well as restoration of paranodal loop electron density on electron microscopy, which is indicative of normalized paranodal junction formation and enhanced axon-Schwann cell interactions (Khalaf et al., 2022; Boatright et al., 2019). These combined actions aim to reverse the pathogenic mechanisms in CMT where chronic ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in Schwann cells impede the proper assembly of cell adhesion molecules necessary for proper nerve conduction (Kusaczuk, 2019; Khalaf et al., 2022). Additionally, TUDCA’s favorable pharmacokinetic profile—including its peripheral distribution and established safety in liver disease—further supports its candidacy as a repurposed treatment in a chronic neuropathic condition like CMT (Jia, 2009; Boatright et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, TUDCA represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease based on a multifaceted preclinical rationale. Its naturally derived origin from UDCA, enhanced by chemical conjugation with taurine, places it within a well-characterized class of bile acids with proven hepatoprotective and neuroprotective properties (Kusaczuk, 2019). Strengths of TUDCA include its robust ability to act as a chemical chaperone, reducing ER stress and preventing misfolded protein accumulation—a mechanism that is critically relevant to Schwann cell dysfunction in CMT (Kusaczuk, 2019; Khalaf et al., 2022). Additionally, its capacity to stabilize mitochondrial membranes and inhibit apoptotic signaling via caspase inhibition has been well documented in both neuronal and hepatocellular models (Ackerman & Gerhard, 2016; Chen et al., 2022). Preclinical evidence demonstrating improved NF155 surface expression and restored paranodal junction architecture in MPZ mutant Schwann cells and Trembler-J mice provides compelling support for its potential to reverse the cellular deficits observed in CMT (Kusaczuk, 2019; Khalaf et al., 2022). Furthermore, the extensive safety profile of TUDCA from its use in hepatobiliary conditions, along with its favorable bioavailability and peripheral distribution, reinforces the translational feasibility of repurposing this agent for neuropathic conditions (Jia, 2009; Boatright et al., 2019).

Nevertheless, there are notable weaknesses and challenges to consider. Despite promising preclinical data and mechanistic rationale, direct clinical evidence supporting the use of TUDCA in CMT is currently lacking; no clinical trials have been explicitly designed to investigate its efficacy in demyelinating neuropathies such as CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, while the data from MPZ mutant Schwann cell studies and Trembler-J mouse models are encouraging, the heterogeneity of CMT and variability in its genetic underpinnings may complicate translational outcomes. The optimal dosing regimen for achieving effective concentration in peripheral nerves without eliciting off-target effects remains to be established. Additionally, it is not yet clear whether the improvements in paranodal junction structure and function observed in animal models will translate into clinically meaningful outcomes in patients with CMT, such as functional motor and sensory improvements (Khalaf et al., 2022; Kusaczuk, 2019).

Overall, TUDCA’s multifactorial mechanism—encompassing ER stress reduction, mitochondrial membrane stabilization, and promotion of correct surface targeting of septate junction proteins—provides a solid biochemical foundation for its potential efficacy in treating CMT. The candidate demonstrates significant strengths in preclinical models that recapitulate key aspects of Schwann cell pathology in CMT. Its extensive clinical use in hepatobiliary disorders and emerging use in neurodegenerative disease contexts further support its repositioning for neuropathies. However, the transition from preclinical promise to clinical utility in CMT will require well-designed studies to address dosing strategies, patient selection, and long-term safety in the context of a chronic demyelinating disease. Based on the current literature and mechanistic insights, TUDCA merits further investigation as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for CMT, with the potential to restore paranodal junction integrity by alleviating ER and mitochondrial stress in Schwann cells (Kusaczuk, 2019; Khalaf et al., 2022).
