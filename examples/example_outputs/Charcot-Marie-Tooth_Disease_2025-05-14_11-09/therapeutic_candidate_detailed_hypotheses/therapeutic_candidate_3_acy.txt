Proposal for ACY-738 (HDAC6 inhibitor; MedChemExpress catalog # HY-11010)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
ACY-738 is a fully synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor developed as a selective modulator of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). It belongs to the class of aromatic hydroxamate-based inhibitors, more specifically, pyrimidine hydroxyl amide derivatives, that have been optimized for high isoform selectivity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. The chemical design of ACY-738 follows the classic pharmacophore of HDAC inhibitors comprising three essential domains: a zinc-binding group (ZBG) capable of chelating the catalytic Zn²⁺ ion in the HDAC active site, a hydrophobic linker that spans the channel to the active site, and a cap group that interacts with the surface residues surrounding the pocket. ACY-738 was identified in parallel with related compounds such as ACY-775, ACY-1215 (Ricolinostat), and ACY-241 (Citarinostat) by medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at improving selectivity toward HDAC6 with optimized brain penetration and oral bioavailability (Jochems et al., 2014; Vergani et al., 2019). Its synthesis, although not fully detailed in the provided excerpts, is known to involve the construction of a hydroxamate moiety linked to a heterocyclic scaffold—often a pyrimidine—that confers both its potency and selectivity profiles. This chemical class has historically been used in both oncology and neurodegenerative contexts, relying on the ability of the hydroxamate group to stably coordinate with zinc ions in the catalytic site of HDAC family enzymes while the cap group enables isoform discrimination (Xiao & Zhang, 2020; Kalin & Bergman, 2013).

Therapeutic History:
HDAC6 inhibitors as a drug class have been widely explored for their potential to modulate non-histone substrate acetylation, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, certain cancers, and autoimmune disorders. Pan and isoform-selective HDAC inhibitors have been in clinical development for cancer due to their capacity to perturb epigenetic and proteostatic regulation; however, the broad-spectrum inhibitors suffer from high toxicity and limited brain penetration. In contrast, selective HDAC6 inhibitors—by virtue of their minimal effect on nuclear histones—offer a more favorable safety profile. ACY-738 is one such inhibitor that has been studied preclinically for its antidepressant-like and neuroprotective properties owing to its ability to rapidly penetrate the brain and modulate the acetylation state of non-histone proteins such as α-tubulin and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) (Jochems et al., 2014; Xiao & Zhang, 2020). Although there is no record in the provided context of ACY-738 being used clinically specifically for Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, its favorable pharmacokinetic profile, robust selectivity for HDAC6, and evidence from models of peripheral neuropathy and neurodegeneration suggest potential utility in peripheral nerve diseases, including CMT. In preclinical settings, HDAC6 inhibitors have been shown to improve phenotypes in models of proteotoxic stress and neurodegeneration; for example, HDAC6 knockout mice display largely normal development, suggesting that inhibition can be well tolerated (Batchu et al., 2016). Moreover, similar compounds have been reported to reduce protein aggregate burden and improve myelination in PMP22-overexpressing Schwann cells—a model relevant to CMT disease pathology—supporting the broader therapeutic use of ACY-738 in diseases characterized by disrupted proteostasis (Hideshima et al., 2016; Vergani et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, HDAC6 is a unique member of the histone deacetylase family because it harbors two catalytic domains as well as a zinc finger ubiquitin-binding domain (ZnF-UBP). Unlike class I HDACs that primarily target histones and thus regulate chromatin structure, HDAC6 predominantly deacetylates non-histone substrates located in the cytoplasm. Key among its substrates is α-tubulin, where deacetylation by HDAC6 influences microtubule stability and cell motility (Batchu et al., 2016). In addition to tubulin, HDAC6 also targets heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a molecular chaperone critical for the folding and trafficking of a host of client proteins. HSP90 acetylation modulated by HDAC6 impairs its chaperone function, affecting the processing and maturation of client proteins such as neurofascin-155 (NF155), a cell-adhesion molecule necessary for paranodal assembly in myelinated nerves (Shen & Kozikowski, 2020; Jochems et al., 2014). By inhibiting HDAC6, ACY-738 is postulated to block the deacetylation of HSP90, leading to an increase in HSP90 acetylation. This modification of HSP90 is believed to enhance its chaperone activity, thereby facilitating the proper folding, trafficking, and localization of paranodal CAMs to the nodes and paranodes of myelinated fibers (Xiao & Zhang, 2020; Kalin & Bergman, 2013). Furthermore, selective HDAC6 inhibition might contribute to the clearance of misfolded protein aggregates via promotion of the aggresome-autophagy pathway, further alleviating proteotoxic stress in Schwann cells (Batchu et al., 2016; Lechner et al., 2022). These biochemical interactions—where the hydroxamate moiety of ACY-738 chelates the catalytic zinc ion within the CD2 domain of HDAC6 while the cap group secures selectivity—form the mechanistic basis by which ACY-738 modulates the acetylation status of key proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and protein quality control (Jochems et al., 2014; Xiao & Zhang, 2020).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis underpinning the use of ACY-738 in the treatment of CMT is that HDAC6-mediated deacetylation of HSP90 perturbs its chaperone function, resulting in the mislocalization of paranodal CAMs such as NF155 and Caspr1. This mislocalization leads to impaired paranodal junction assembly and, consequently, defective nodal gap architecture—a hallmark of some forms of CMT. With ACY-738, the expected therapeutic effect is multifold. First, by inhibiting HDAC6, ACY-738 should increase the acetylation of HSP90. Elevated HSP90 acetylation restores or enhances its chaperone capacity, which is critical for the proper folding and delivery of proteins like NF155 to target regions within Schwann cells (Xiao & Zhang, 2020; Shen & Kozikowski, 2020). Second, improved chaperone-mediated trafficking of paranodal CAMs is anticipated to facilitate the reassembly of septate junctions at the paranode, thereby restoring nodal integrity and function. Third, independent preclinical findings have demonstrated that HDAC6 inhibitors can reduce protein aggregate accumulation—a beneficial effect in cells stressed by misfolded proteins such as mutant PMP22 in CMT models—which may lead to improved myelination and overall nerve function (Hideshima et al., 2016; Vergani et al., 2019). Lastly, the favorable pharmacokinetic profile of ACY-738—with systemic distribution encompassing both central and peripheral compartments—ensures that the compound can reach Schwann cells in peripheral nerves where the disease pathology is observed (Jochems et al., 2014; Xiao & Zhang, 2020). Collectively, the restoration of paranodal architecture is expected to translate into improved nerve conduction velocity and clinical amelioration of the motor and sensory deficits seen in CMT patients.

Overall Evaluation:
Based on a comprehensive review of current literature, ACY-738 shows strong promise as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease by addressing fundamental biochemical derangements implicated in disease pathogenesis. One significant strength is its high degree of selectivity for HDAC6, enabling it to target the deacetylation of non-histone substrates such as HSP90 and alpha-tubulin without producing the broader epigenetic perturbations associated with pan-HDAC inhibition (Jochems et al., 2014; Xiao & Zhang, 2020). The ability of ACY-738 to modulate HSP90 acetylation is particularly noteworthy, as it aligns well with the therapeutic hypothesis that enhanced chaperone function may correct the mislocalization of paranodal cell adhesion molecules critical for maintaining nodal gap architecture. Preclinical data indicating that related HDAC6 inhibitors decrease protein aggregate formation and improve myelination in models of proteostasis stress further support the candidate’s potential for addressing CMT-specific pathology (Batchu et al., 2016; Hideshima et al., 2016). Its favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including pronounced CNS and peripheral distribution coupled with a lack of significant acute toxicity, bolster its candidacy as a repurposed treatment for peripheral nerve disorders such as CMT (Jochems et al., 2014; Xiao & Zhang, 2020).

Nonetheless, there are several challenges and uncertainties that must be addressed. First, while the mechanism linking enhanced HSP90 acetylation to the proper trafficking of paranodal CAMs like NF155 is plausible, direct evidence in CMT models remains limited. Further detailed studies are needed to establish that ACY-738 not only increases HSP90 acetylation but also directly leads to normalized distribution of these key proteins in Schwann cells affected by PMP22 overexpression or other CMT-associated molecular abnormalities. Secondly, although preclinical studies in other disease models, such as Alzheimer’s and certain cancers, have shown beneficial outcomes with HDAC6 inhibitors, the translation of these effects to a peripheral neuropathy context, especially in a chronic condition like CMT, requires rigorous testing in relevant animal models and eventually in early-phase clinical trials. Finally, long-term safety, particularly with respect to off-target effects or potential resistance mechanisms that might arise in chronic treatment scenarios, remains to be determined (Kalin & Bergman, 2013; Lechner et al., 2022).

Overall, ACY-738 is a strong candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease due to its highly selective inhibition of HDAC6, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and mechanistic rationale targeting both proteostatic stress and defective paranodal protein trafficking. The compound’s design as a hydroxamate-based pyrimidine derivative positions it within a well-studied class of HDAC6 inhibitors that have demonstrated efficacy in multiple in vivo models of neurodegeneration and proteotoxicity. Its ability to modulate HSP90 acetylation is particularly critical, as this molecular interaction underpins the hypothesis that proper chaperone-mediated trafficking of paranodal cell adhesion molecules can restore nodal gap architecture in CMT-affected nerves. Although further work is needed to validate these mechanisms in dedicated CMT models and to ensure long-term tolerability, the overall evaluation supports advancing ACY-738 through preclinical studies with the goal of establishing its efficacy in ameliorating the peripheral neuropathy associated with CMT (Jochems et al., 2014; Batchu et al., 2016; Xiao & Zhang, 2020).
