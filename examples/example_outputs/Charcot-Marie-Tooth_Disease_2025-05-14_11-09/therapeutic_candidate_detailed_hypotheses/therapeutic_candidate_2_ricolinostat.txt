Proposal for Ricolinostat (ACY-1215; Selleckchem catalog # S8040)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Ricolinostat (ACY-1215) is a synthetically derived small molecule that belongs to the class of selective histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitors. It was originally developed as a hydroxamic acid–based compound that features a zinc-binding group (ZBG) – specifically a phenylhydroxamate moiety – coupled with a rigid, large capping structure; this design confers nanomolar potency (IC₅₀ approximately 4.7 nM) and a selectivity factor of roughly 12–13 fold over class I HDACs. Ricolinostat belongs to a generation of therapeutic compounds that have been optimized for selective inhibition of cytosolic HDAC6 while sparing nuclear histones, thus minimizing epigenetic side effects that are common with pan-HDAC inhibitors. Its discovery was driven by the need to target non-histone proteins such as α-tubulin, whose deacetylation by HDAC6 compromises microtubule stability, axonal transport, and ultimately neuronal function. This class of compounds has previously been utilized in oncology settings where rapid cell turnover and aberrant protein acetylation are hallmarks of disease; indeed, Ricolinostat has advanced into clinical trials, primarily in the context of multiple myeloma and some lymphomas, owing to its favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile. The chemical synthesis involves straightforward medicinal chemistry approaches that allowed the optimization not only of potency and selectivity but also properties such as oral bioavailability and peripheral nerve penetrance – attributes that are highly desirable for a repurposed therapeutic candidate against neurodegenerative conditions like Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease (Shen & Kozikowski, 2020; Benoy et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
Ricolinostat’s history is rooted in oncology where HDAC6 inhibitors emerged as promising candidates to treat hematological malignancies. Preclinical pharmacology studies demonstrated that selective inhibition of HDAC6 increases acetylation of α-tubulin, resulting in improved microtubule stability and enhanced cellular transport mechanisms. This has provided the mechanistic rationale behind its evaluation in Phase I and Phase II oncology trials in multiple myeloma, where favorable safety, pharmacokinetic, and oral bioavailability profiles were documented (Benoy et al., 2017). Although its initial development was not aimed at peripheral nerve diseases, the underlying mechanisms – particularly the correction of disrupted tubulin acetylation – have gained strong support from a number of preclinical and biochemical studies in models of neurodegeneration and peripheral neuropathy. For instance, several studies demonstrate that HDAC6 inhibition by compounds related to Ricolinostat restores axonal transport deficits and supports myelination in mutant models of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (Adalbert et al., 2019; Benoy et al., 2017). While Ricolinostat has not been directly tested in clinical trials for CMT itself, the significant number of clinical trials investigating the compound in oncology settings, alongside emerging preclinical evidence in neuropathy models, indicates a promising feasibility to repurpose the drug. Moreover, due to its established clinical databases from oncology studies, there is robust human safety experience available, which greatly accelerates its potential translation to treating diseases such as CMT, a group of hereditary peripheral neuropathies currently lacking disease-modifying treatments (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Shen & Kozikowski, 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Ricolinostat exerts its pharmacological action by selectively inhibiting HDAC6, a class IIb histone deacetylase that is primarily localized in the cytoplasm. HDAC6 has two catalytic domains and primarily deacetylates non-histone substrates, such as α-tubulin. α-Tubulin acetylation at lysine 40 is a post-translational modification that is critical for microtubule stability and for the binding of motor proteins like kinesin-1, which mediate axonal transport of organelles including mitochondria. In Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, and particularly in CMT subtypes that affect axonal transport, reductions in α-tubulin acetylation have been implicated in the disruption of proper transport processes along the axon, leading to impaired nerve function. Ricolinostat is therefore hypothesized to restore this critical biochemical balance by increasing the acetylation levels of α-tubulin; this effect is expected to stabilize microtubules, reduce axonal transport deficits, and ultimately support both neuronal and Schwann cell function (Benoy et al., 2017; Adalbert et al., 2019).

Beyond its direct effect on tubulin acetylation, HDAC6 inhibition has been associated with improved formation and trafficking of critical cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) at the paranodal junctions of myelinated peripheral nerves. In particular, proteins such as Caspr1, Contactin, and Neurofascin-155 form a complex at the paranode that is essential for efficient nerve conduction. In several experimental models, HDAC6 inhibitors have been shown to rescue axonal transport deficits and restore myelination, suggesting that by stabilizing the microtubule cytoskeleton, these agents could facilitate the proper localization and assembly of paranodal complexes. Although direct biochemical studies on Ricolinostat’s impact on the Caspr1-Contactin-Neurofascin-155 complex are not yet complete, there is evidence to suggest that increased microtubule acetylation can improve the transport and assembly of these critical junctional proteins (Benoy et al., 2017; Shen & Kozikowski, 2020). Additionally, enhanced acetylation of HSP90 has been noted with HDAC6 inhibition, which may improve chaperone-mediated protein folding and further contribute to stabilizing protein complexes within the peripheral nerve (Shen & Kozikowski, 2020).

From a biochemical standpoint, the selectivity of Ricolinostat for HDAC6 helps spare the histones in the nucleus, thereby reducing the risk of widespread epigenetic modifications that can lead to unwanted side effects. This selective target engagement is measured by dose-dependent increases in acetylated α-tubulin in relevant cell types, including dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and Schwann cells in co-culture models, where improvements in axonal mitochondrial transport have been reported (Adalbert et al., 2019; Benoy et al., 2017). In summary, the mechanism of action is firmly based on the concept that elevated HDAC6 activity in CMT diminishes tubulin acetylation, destabilizes microtubules, and impairs the trafficking of key adhesion molecules necessary for paranodal complex formation, and that inhibition with Ricolinostat reverses these deficits.

Expected Effect:
In the context of the proposed assay for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, it is expected that Ricolinostat will significantly increase the levels of acetylated α-tubulin in both neuronal axons and in Schwann cells – cell types critical in the proper formation and maintenance of myelinated nerve fibers. By increasing α-tubulin acetylation, Ricolinostat should enhance microtubule stability, which in turn is anticipated to improve the axonal transport of organelles such as mitochondria and the proper distribution of membrane components, including the adhesion molecules necessary for paranodal junction assembly. In experimental models, HDAC6 inhibition has been shown to rescue axonal transport deficits and improve motor and sensory nerve conduction, providing functional validation for the biochemical effects observed (Benoy et al., 2017; Adalbert et al., 2019).

Furthermore, by promoting stable microtubule networks in both axons and Schwann cells, Ricolinostat is hypothesized to facilitate proper trafficking and membrane insertion of the Caspr1-Contactin-Neurofascin-155 complex, thereby restoring the structural integrity of paranodal domains. This, in turn, is expected to result in improved nerve conduction and potentially a reversal of clinical deficits associated with CMT, such as distal muscle weakness and sensory loss. Preclinical evidence in mutant models – including those with impaired axonal transport and myelination – has demonstrated that selective HDAC6 inhibitors can restore a range of cellular functions, from the reinnervation of neuromuscular junctions to the recovery of motor nerve conduction velocities (Benoy et al., 2017; Adalbert et al., 2019).

Ricolinostat’s documented oral bioavailability and its capacity to reach peripheral nerve tissues provide additional support for its expected beneficial effect in CMT. Although much of the detailed preclinical evaluation has been conducted in oncology and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy models (Krukowski et al., 2017), the molecular mechanisms – particularly the correction of tubulin hypoacetylation – are highly relevant to CMT pathology as well (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Benoy et al., 2017). The hypothesis that restoring proper paranodal junctions will lead to improved nerve conduction is supported by the known biology of these complexes, which are critical for saltatory conduction in myelinated nerves. Although direct studies on Caspr1-Contactin-Neurofascin-155 trafficking in response to Ricolinostat are pending, the available data from related HDAC6 inhibitors in analogous systems suggest that the anticipated effects are plausible and reproducible in vitro and in animal models.

Overall Evaluation:
Ricolinostat (ACY-1215) stands out as a promising candidate for repurposing to treat Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease based on several key strengths. Its selective inhibition of HDAC6 ensures that its primary action enhances α-tubulin acetylation without broadly altering gene expression through histone modifications, thereby reducing potential side effects associated with pan-HDAC inhibition (Shen & Kozikowski, 2020; Benoy et al., 2017). There is compelling preclinical evidence that HDAC6 inhibitors restore axonal transport and rescue defects in motor and sensory nerve function in models relevant to CMT (Adalbert et al., 2019; Benoy et al., 2017). These findings translate into a clear mechanistic rationale: by increasing microtubule acetylation, Ricolinostat can stabilize the intraneuronal cytoskeleton, ensuring the proper trafficking of organelles and membrane proteins essential for paranodal junction integrity such as the Caspr1-Contactin-Neurofascin-155 complex. This is especially crucial in Schwann cells and axons, where disrupted microtubule dynamics contribute to impaired nerve conduction and demyelination commonly observed in CMT.

Another notable strength is the extensive clinical safety data already available for Ricolinostat from oncology trials. Its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable peripheral nerve penetration in preclinical studies support the feasibility of its repurposing for chronic peripheral neuropathy treatments. Moreover, the candidate’s mechanism of action addresses a fundamental cellular deficit in CMT – compromised axonal transport – rather than merely alleviating symptoms, which could translate into disease-modifying effects.

On the other hand, several weaknesses and uncertainties merit attention. Despite encouraging preclinical data in various models of peripheral neuropathy and neurodegeneration, there remains a gap in direct clinical studies specifically targeting CMT with Ricolinostat. In addition, while preclinical work indicates that HDAC6 inhibition improves molecular markers such as α-tubulin acetylation, further detailed studies are required to confirm that this biochemical effect indeed translates to a full restoration of paranodal junction assembly and proper localization of the Caspr1-Contactin-Neurofascin-155 complex in Schwann cells. Moreover, the long-term effects and potential compensatory mechanisms in chronic treatment scenarios have not yet been fully elucidated, and caution must be taken given that peripheral nerve physiology may involve complex interactions beyond microtubule stability, including lipid homeostasis and the regulation of additional deacetylases (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022; English & Barton, 2021).

Another area that requires further exploration is the detailed pharmacokinetic profile of Ricolinostat in the context of peripheral neuropathy. Although its oral bioavailability is well established from cancer studies, studies specifically evaluating its concentration and activity in peripheral nerve tissue in CMT models are sparse. Furthermore, while the overall safety profile in oncology has been favorable, differences in dosing regimens and long-term exposure in a chronic neuromuscular disease setting must be evaluated carefully.

In summary, Ricolinostat’s strengths include its potent, selective inhibition of HDAC6, its mechanistic alignment with the pathophysiological underpinnings of CMT – particularly through the restoration of tubulin acetylation and axonal transport – and its extensive clinical safety record in oncology, which collectively make it an attractive candidate for repurposing in hereditary neuropathies. Its potential to enhance paranodal junction assembly by promoting the proper trafficking and assembly of the Caspr1-Contactin-Neurofascin-155 complex represents an innovative therapeutic angle that, if validated, could offer significant improvements in nerve conduction and clinical outcomes in CMT patients (Benoy et al., 2017; Shen & Kozikowski, 2020). However, further preclinical studies in CMT-specific models, detailed investigations into its effects on Schwann cell biology, and direct clinical evaluations in the context of peripheral neuropathy are essential to address existing uncertainties before advancing to large-scale clinical trials. Overall, Ricolinostat represents a promising candidate with a strong molecular rationale and encouraging preliminary data that warrant further investigation as a potential disease-modifying therapy for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Benoy et al., 2017; Adalbert et al., 2019).
