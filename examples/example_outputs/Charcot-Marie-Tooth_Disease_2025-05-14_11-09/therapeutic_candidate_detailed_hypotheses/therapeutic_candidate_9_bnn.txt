Proposal for BNN-27 (TrkB agonist; lab synthesizable per protocol in Cattaneo et al., 2008)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
BNN-27 is a synthetic neurosteroid designed through chemical modifications of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an endogenous neurosteroid known for its broad neurotrophic properties. The synthesis of BNN-27 involves derivatization at the C17 position to yield a specific 17-spiroepoxy steroid derivative. According to the literature, particularly the work described by Pediaditakis et al. (2016), BNN-27 was developed to overcome shortcomings associated with natural neurotrophins such as poor blood–brain barrier (BBB) penetrance and undesirable side effects like hyperalgesia. BNN-27 belongs to a class of small molecule neurotrophin mimetics that have been engineered to selectively interact with neurotrophin receptors, with the aim of recapitulating the beneficial neuroprotective and neurogenic properties of endogenous growth factors. Although originally designed to target TrkA receptors—as evidenced by detailed binding studies and receptor phosphorylation assays—there is a hypothesis under consideration that BNN-27 might also serve as a TrkB agonist. This possibility is of particular interest given the wide therapeutic use of neurotrophin mimetics; similar synthetic compounds have been evaluated in various neurodegenerative and peripheral demyelinating conditions. In summary, BNN-27 represents a chemically accessible prototype from the DHEA structural class, offering properties such as blood–brain and –nerve barrier permeability and a favorable safety profile in preclinical models (Pediaditakis et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, BNN-27 and its related synthetic microneurotrophins have been extensively studied for their neuroprotective effects in central nervous system (CNS) disease models, including neurodegeneration, Alzheimer’s disease, and traumatic brain injury. Preclinical studies report that BNN-27 can protect neurons from apoptosis, enhance survival signals, and potentiate the activity of endogenous neurotrophins without producing significant off-target effects such as pain hypersensitivity (Pediaditakis et al., 2016). Moreover, these compounds have been shown to cross the BBB, making them attractive candidates in diseases of the CNS. In animal models, BNN-27 has demonstrated bioavailability and low toxicity, corroborating its potential for clinical translation (Gravanis et al., 2017; Pediaditakis et al., 2016). However, despite extensive investigation in models of central neurodegeneration, there is very little direct evidence that BNN-27 has been applied in the treatment of peripheral neuropathies such as Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease. Clinical trial searches for neurosteroids and TrkB agonists in CMT have returned a large number of trials assessing neurosteroid or Trk receptor modulators (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), but none specifically address BNN-27 in the context of CMT pathology. Hence, while the therapeutic class to which BNN-27 belongs has broad validation in neurodegenerative and remyelinating conditions, its direct therapeutic history in CMT or similar peripheral demyelinating disorders remains unexplored (Sleigh et al., 2023; Narducci et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
The established mechanism of action for BNN-27 is rooted in its ability to act as a neurotrophin mimetic. According to data presented by Pediaditakis et al. (2016), BNN-27 selectively binds to the extracellular domain of TrkA receptors, inducing receptor dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation at tyrosine residues, which then triggers downstream survival and differentiation signaling cascades such as the MAPK (ERK1/2) pathway and Akt phosphorylation (Pediaditakis et al., 2016). The design rationale behind BNN-27 was to produce a molecule that can potentiate low levels of neurotrophins like NGF without eliciting deleterious hyperalgesic effects, which is a common side effect associated with native NGF. In experimental models, BNN-27 has been demonstrated to facilitate the recycling of internalized TrkA receptors, thereby sustaining surface receptor levels and prolonging neuroprotective signaling (Pediaditakis et al., 2016).

The candidate hypothesis under evaluation suggests that BNN-27 might act as a selective TrkB agonist on Schwann cells. This proposal is based on the well-established role of BDNF-TrkB signaling in neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and myelination in central nervous system contexts (Gupta et al., 2013; Fletcher et al., 2018). In the peripheral nervous system, TrkB is known to bind BDNF, which has been implicated in modulating Schwann cell differentiation, axonal support, and myelin repair processes. Notably, some studies have suggested that activation of TrkB receptors may positively regulate downstream pathways such as the Rho GTPase family, which in turn modulates cytoskeletal dynamics and may influence clustering of cell adhesion molecule (CAM) complexes at paranodal junctions (Richner et al., 2014; Forsell et al., 2024).

However, it is important to note that most of the published data on BNN-27 in the provided context emphasize its selectivity for TrkA rather than TrkB. For instance, the detailed investigation by Pediaditakis et al. (2016) repeatedly confirms BNN-27’s role as a selective TrkA agonist, with no significant activation demonstrated for TrkB or TrkC receptors (Pediaditakis et al., 2016). Conversely, synthetic analogs of BNN-27 that have been modified at certain positions on the steroid scaffold have shown potential for selective TrkB agonism (Narducci et al., 2023). Nonetheless, the candidate under evaluation in our proposal is BNN-27 itself, and current mechanistic evidence does not robustly support its direct activation of TrkB. Moreover, there is a lack of data indicating that BNN-27 modulates Rho GTPase signaling in Schwann cells, or that it promotes the paranodal clustering of key proteins such as NF155 and Caspr1 in peripheral nerve models. Serial imaging studies and electrophysiological data demonstrating these effects in relevant peripheral nerve demyelination models have not yet been published (Sleigh et al., 2023; Forsell et al., 2024). Thus, while the molecular underpinnings of BNN-27’s neuroprotective action via TrkA are well characterized, evidence supporting a similar mechanism via TrkB on Schwann cells remains speculative at this time.

Expected Effect:
The working hypothesis posits that administration of BNN-27 will improve paranodal assembly in CMT by selectively activating TrkB receptors on Schwann cells. The expected downstream effect is that such activation would modulate Rho GTPase activity, thereby enhancing cytoskeletal regulation required for the proper clustering of paranodal CAM complexes such as NF155 and Caspr1. This clustering is critical for maintaining paranodal integrity and, by extension, the stability and function of myelinated peripheral nerves. The hypothesis additionally suggests that BNN-27, through its neuroprotective effects, will rescue electrophysiological deficits observed in rodent models of demyelination by promoting efficient remyelination and proper axon–glia interactions (Sleigh et al., 2023; Richner et al., 2014).

In assays designed to test this hypothesis, one would expect to observe enhanced expression of paranodal proteins (NF155 and Caspr1) and improved paranodal integrity by immunocytochemical and imaging techniques following treatment with BNN-27. Electrophysiological measures such as nerve conduction velocity should also improve as a consequence of more robust remyelination and paranodal organization. In peripheral nerve models, Schwann cells have been reported to express TrkB receptors, where BDNF is known to influence remyelination processes (Gupta et al., 2013; Fletcher et al., 2018). However, the direct effect of BNN-27 on Schwann cells has not been conclusively demonstrated. Some promising in vitro data from similar synthetic neurosteroid derivatives suggest that modifications can yield TrkB-selective analogs with efficacy in protecting neural cells from apoptosis and improving neurite outgrowth (Narducci et al., 2023). Yet, it is unclear whether BNN-27 itself will elicit a comparable effect on Schwann cells, particularly regarding Rho GTPase–driven cytoskeletal rearrangements and CAM clustering necessary for paranodal assembly (Forsell et al., 2024). Hence, while the expected pharmacodynamic effect is rational based on known roles of TrkB signaling in myelination, the direct translation of this mechanism to BNN-27 remains to be validated experimentally.

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating BNN-27 as a potential therapeutic candidate for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, several strengths and weaknesses become apparent based on the current literature review.

Among the strengths, BNN-27 benefits from a robust preclinical safety profile, having been shown to cross the blood–brain barrier and avoid hyperalgesic side effects that have hindered the use of native neurotrophins like NGF (Pediaditakis et al., 2016). Its synthetic origin renders it readily amenable to laboratory synthesis and potential chemical modification, which is beneficial for medicinal chemistry optimization. Additionally, the broader class of microneurotrophins has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in several CNS models, suggesting that similar mechanisms could be harnessed for peripheral nerve repair (Gravanis et al., 2017; Bennett et al., 2016). The concept of repurposing neurotrophin mimetics for enhancing myelination and paranodal assembly is well supported by literature demonstrating that neurotrophins and their receptors are crucial for maintaining myelin integrity and promoting nerve regeneration (Richner et al., 2014; Gupta et al., 2013).

However, the weaknesses of BNN-27 in this specific application are significant. First, the majority of the mechanistic evidence supports BNN-27’s selective activity on TrkA receptors rather than TrkB. As the hypothesis being evaluated for CMT specifically requires selective TrkB activation on Schwann cells, this discrepancy raises concerns about the direct applicability of BNN-27 for this indication (Pediaditakis et al., 2016). Second, while there is strong rationale in the literature that TrkB activation can mediate downstream Rho GTPase regulation leading to improved cytoskeletal dynamics and paranodal assembly, no direct experimental data presently show that BNN-27 can reproduce these effects in Schwann cells or in relevant CMT animal models (Sleigh et al., 2023). Another point of concern is that the broader association between NTRK2 (the gene encoding TrkB) and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease is weak, with genomic studies indicating only minimal direct evidence linking TrkB alterations to CMT pathogenesis (Ochoa et al., 2023). This suggests that even if BNN-27 could activate TrkB on Schwann cells, its impact on disease progression remains speculative without stronger genetic and mechanistic support. Moreover, while numerous clinical trials in CMT are exploring neurotrophin modulation—with many targeting TrkB and related pathways—the vast majority of these studies have not yet yielded definitive mechanistic insights or clinical endpoints directly attributable to TrkB agonism (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In conclusion, while BNN-27 is a promising compound within the class of synthetic neurosteroid derivatives and exhibits advantageous pharmacokinetic and safety properties, its current profile as a selective TrkA agonist severely challenges its repurposing as a TrkB agonist for peripheral demyelinating diseases such as CMT. The hypothesis that BNN-27 will enhance paranodal assembly by activating TrkB receptors on Schwann cells through downstream Rho GTPase regulation is attractive from a mechanistic standpoint. However, the existing literature does not provide sufficient biochemical or in vivo data to support this mechanism for BNN-27 in the context of Schwann cell biology. Further work is required to either chemically modify BNN-27 to improve its selectivity for TrkB or to generate definitive preclinical data demonstrating its ability to induce TrkB-mediated paranodal assembly, enhance expression and clustering of NF155 and Caspr1, and ultimately improve electrophysiological outcomes in demyelination models. Only with such data can we confirm whether BNN-27 or a derivative thereof holds promise for treating CMT via the proposed mechanism (Pediaditakis et al., 2016; Narducci et al., 2023; Forsell et al., 2024).

Overall, the strength of BNN-27 lies in its established safety, BBB permeability, and neuroprotective efficacy in CNS models, as well as its synthetic accessibility which permits further structural refinement. The primary weakness is the lack of evidence for TrkB agonism and consequent downstream effects on Schwann cell–mediated paranodal assembly, which are critical for its repurposing as a therapeutic in Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. In light of these considerations, it is recommended that additional studies be undertaken to rigorously test BNN-27’s effect on Schwann cells, including investigations into receptor subtype specificity, modulation of Rho GTPase signaling, and the ability to promote paranodal CAM clustering in relevant peripheral nerve models. Only with such data can we confirm whether BNN-27 or a derivative thereof holds promise for treating CMT via the proposed mechanism (Sleigh et al., 2023; Pediaditakis et al., 2016; Gupta et al., 2013).
