Proposal for N-Acetylcysteine (NAC; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # A7250)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate – N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)
N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is a well‐established small molecule belonging to the class of thiol-containing antioxidants. Derived from the naturally occurring amino acid L-cysteine, NAC is an acetylated variant synthesized by chemical modification that enhances its stability and bioavailability relative to cysteine. The compound is commercially available (for example, from Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #A7250) and has been in clinical use for several decades, largely due to its potent ability to replenish intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels—a critical aspect of cellular redox homeostasis. As a prodrug, NAC is rapidly deacetylated in vivo to yield cysteine, the rate-limiting precursor required for de novo GSH synthesis. This property has propelled NAC’s clinical use in multiple therapeutic areas, particularly in the treatment of acetaminophen overdose where depletion of hepatic glutathione underpins toxicity. Additionally, NAC’s free radical scavenging ability via its sulfhydryl group places it among a class of compounds exploited for mitigating oxidative stress, which is a common pathological element in various neurodegenerative diseases, pulmonary disorders, and even support in psychiatric conditions. Its chemical simplicity and well-documented pharmacokinetic profile have made NAC a prime candidate for repurposing in conditions where oxidative stress plays a central role, and its documented usage in models of peripheral nerve injury underlines its potential relevance in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022).

Therapeutic History
The therapeutic history of NAC is extensive. Initially introduced as a mucolytic agent to clear pulmonary secretions, NAC soon found utility as an antidote for paracetamol (acetaminophen) toxicity. In this context, its ability to restore depleted glutathione stores in hepatocytes is well established, and its safety profile in this indication is exemplary, with decades of clinical experience demonstrating minimal toxicity even at high doses (Stochelski, 2018). Furthermore, NAC has been subject to numerous clinical investigations in diverse conditions characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation. For instance, NAC has been evaluated in clinical trials for neuropsychiatric disorders such as bipolar depression and autism spectrum disorders, where its modulation of oxidative stress and potential to restore cellular homeostasis have been of significant interest (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019). Preclinical studies have also investigated NAC’s role in mitigating chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity, particularly in trials evaluating its potential to reduce cisplatin- and paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018). Moreover, systematic preclinical studies related to diabetic peripheral neuropathy—a syndrome that shares important mechanistic overlaps with hereditary neuropathies like CMT—have reported that NAC significantly reduces oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and inflammatory mediator release while enhancing endogenous antioxidant defenses (Emara et al., 2024; Stochelski, 2018). Although direct clinical application of NAC in CMT disease has not been extensively reported, the compound’s use in multiple peripheral neuropathy models and the broad clinical experience with NAC in conditions associated with oxidative stress provide a strong historical basis for its evaluation in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014).

Mechanism of Action
NAC exerts its effects primarily through two interconnected mechanisms: replenishment of intracellular glutathione and direct free radical scavenging. On a molecular level, the therapeutic action of NAC is initiated once the acetyl group is removed in vivo, yielding cysteine. This cysteine enters the intracellular metabolism and is utilized in the synthesis of glutathione, a tripeptide composed of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. As the principal antioxidant in cells, glutathione directly neutralizes reactive oxygen species (ROS) and repairs oxidative damage by acting as a substrate for enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (Stochelski, 2018). The enhanced glutathione synthesis following NAC administration is especially significant in Schwann cells, the myelinating cells of the peripheral nervous system, which are known to be vulnerable to oxidative damage due to their relatively low baseline antioxidant capacity. Under conditions of oxidative stress, depletion of glutathione in these cells exacerbates damage to myelin and the structural proteins involved in paranodal junction formation, including adhesion molecules like neurofascin 155 (NF155) on the glial membrane and contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) on the axolemma (Emara et al., 2024; Zaki et al., 2018). NAC’s ability to replenish glutathione thus directly reduces ROS-mediated oxidative modifications, such as carbonylation and lipid peroxidation, which are critical in damaging the paranodal region and consequently impairing nerve conduction (Stochelski, 2018). Additionally, NAC can exert a direct scavenging effect on free radicals via its sulfhydryl group, intercepting reactive species before they can initiate damaging oxidation processes. This dual action has been shown to prevent secondary cell death cascades initiated by mitochondrial dysfunction and nitric oxide overproduction—key pathological features in peripheral nerve injury and demyelinating conditions (Hart, 2001; Hichor et al., 2018). The compound may also modulate redox-sensitive signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, which plays a central role in the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and further propagates oxidative damage. In summary, NAC restores redox balance by both ensuring adequate glutathione availability and directly neutralizing reactive species, thereby preventing oxidative modification of essential structural proteins in the nerve (Stochelski, 2018; Zhong et al., 2023).

Expected Effect in CMT – Restoration of Paranodal Junction Integrity
The central hypothesis driving the evaluation of NAC in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is that by replenishing intracellular glutathione in Schwann cells, NAC can mitigate oxidative stress–induced degradation of paranodal adhesion molecules, thereby preserving the architecture of the nodal gap. Paranodal junctions in myelinated peripheral nerves are highly specialized regions where tight axoglial interactions occur, mediated by adhesion molecules such as NF155 on the glial membrane and Caspr1 on the axonal surface. These junctions are critically dependent on the integrity of the myelin sheath and the extracellular environment maintained by Schwann cells. In animal models of CMT, including those with GDAP1 mutations that mimic the human condition, oxidative stress exacerbates paranodal disorganization by reducing the expression and causing oxidative modifications of these adhesion molecules—as evidenced by an increase in carbonyl adducts detected using western blot analysis (Emara et al., 2024; Zaki et al., 2018). The expected effect of NAC, according to the working hypothesis, is a two-fold restoration process. First, by replenishing cysteine levels, NAC increases the synthesis of glutathione in Schwann cells, which in turn neutralizes ROS and prevents further oxidative protein modifications. Second, by directly scavenging free radicals, NAC reduces the oxidative burden on these cells and preserves the molecular integrity of structural proteins integral to paranodal junctions. Preclinical evidence supports that administration of NAC in peripheral nerve injury models leads to improved nerve conduction velocities, restoration of myelin thickness, and the re-formation of septate junctions as observed on electron microscopy—findings that are anticipated to translate to CMT models (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; Hart, 2001). Furthermore, expression profiling confirms that both NF155 and Caspr1 are expressed in Schwann cells and the axonal compartments, respectively; these proteins are highly sensitive to redox imbalances, and their degradation under oxidative stress correlates with clinical deficits in nerve conduction and motor function (Hichor et al., 2018; Stochelski, 2018). Therefore, the administration of NAC is expected to foster a stabilized paranodal architecture by preventing oxidative degradation and promoting the re-synthesis or maintenance of these adhesion molecules—a mechanism that should manifest as improved electrophysiological parameters and functional nerve conduction in experimental models of CMT.

Overall Evaluation
Evaluating NAC as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease involves weighing several critical strengths and potential weaknesses in the context of current biomedical research, clinical practice, and preclinical models.

Strengths:
1. Extensive Historical Use and Safety Profile – NAC’s longstanding history in clinical practice, particularly in treating acetaminophen toxicity and as a mucolytic agent, offers significant reassurance regarding its safety and tolerability. Large-scale human use has resulted in a well-documented safety profile, even in high-dose intravenous applications, which supports its repurposing for chronic conditions such as CMT (Stochelski, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019).
2. Dual Mechanism of Action – The capacity of NAC to both replenish glutathione and directly scavenge reactive oxygen species provides a robust biochemical basis for its neuroprotective effects. This dual mechanism is particularly advantageous in diseases like CMT, where oxidative stress is a key driver of paranodal junction disruption and subsequent demyelination (Hart, 2001; Zhong et al., 2023).
3. Preclinical Efficacy in Related Neuropathies – While direct clinical data in CMT patients is limited, extensive preclinical studies in models of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy have demonstrated that NAC can mitigate oxidative damage, improve nerve conduction velocities, and restore myelin integrity. These findings are directly translatable to the pathogenic processes observed in CMT, where similar oxidative mechanisms prevail (Emara et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008).
4. Oral Bioavailability and Peripheral Nerve Distribution – NAC’s pharmacokinetic properties include good oral bioavailability and the capacity for peripheral nervous system penetration. This ensures that when administered, sufficient concentrations reach Schwann cells along peripheral nerves to exert the desired neuroprotective effects, potentially alleviating the progressive demyelination observed in CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018).
5. Potential to Preserve Critical Adhesion Molecules – The proposed mechanism of action specifically targets the stabilization of paranodal adhesion molecules such as NF155 and Caspr1 through the reduction of ROS-mediated oxidative modifications. This is particularly promising given that disruption of these molecules is a central pathological feature in demyelinating peripheral neuropathies, including CMT (Zaki et al., 2018; Emara et al., 2024).

Weaknesses and Challenges:
1. Lack of Direct Clinical Trials in CMT – Despite the extensive use of NAC in other oxidative stress–related conditions, direct evidence from clinical trials focusing on CMT disease is sparse (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022).
2. Uncertainty in Dosing Regimens – Although NAC is generally well tolerated, the optimal dosing regimen required to achieve sufficient glutathione replenishment in Schwann cells for the stabilization of paranodal junctions remains to be determined. Variability in bioavailability, tissue penetration, and metabolic conversion may necessitate dose adjustments that differ from those used in current clinical applications (Stochelski, 2018).
3. Complexity of CMT Pathogenesis – CMT is a genetically heterogeneous disease with multiple subtypes and complex pathogenic mechanisms. While oxidative stress is a common factor, other factors—including genetic mutations impacting axonal transport and Schwann cell biology—may not be fully addressed by an antioxidant therapy alone. Therefore, NAC’s efficacy might be limited by the multifactorial nature of the disease, and combination therapy strategies may ultimately be required (Emara et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020).
4. Translational Gaps Between Preclinical Models and Human Disease – Many of the promising data on NAC’s neuroprotective effects stem from animal models and in vitro studies. Translational challenges often arise when moving from these controlled experimental systems to the human clinical scenario, where variability in disease progression, genetic background, and environmental factors can influence therapeutic outcomes (Hart, 2001; Stochelski, 2018).
5. Potential for Off-Target Effects – Although NAC is generally safe, its modulation of redox-sensitive signaling pathways, such as those involving NF-κB, may have pleiotropic effects that could influence other cellular processes. Careful evaluation of these potential off-target effects is necessary to ensure that chronic administration does not lead to unintended immunomodulatory or metabolic disturbances (Zaki et al., 2018).

Overall, the current literature provides a strong biochemical and preclinical rationale for repurposing NAC as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Its ability to restore glutathione in Schwann cells and to mitigate oxidative stress offers a plausible mechanism by which it may restore the integrity of paranodal junctions, preserving key adhesion molecules such as NF155 and Caspr1 that are critical for proper nerve conduction. Although direct clinical evidence in CMT is presently limited, the extensive history of NAC in various oxidative stress–associated conditions, coupled with promising preclinical data in other models of peripheral neuropathy, positions it as a highly promising adjunct therapy that merits further investigation. The translational challenges and the need for optimized dosing regimens underscore the importance of well-designed clinical trials tailored to the genetic and pathological heterogeneity of CMT. Ultimately, the integration of NAC into a therapeutic regimen—potentially as part of a combination strategy with other neuroprotective agents—could represent a significant advancement in the management of this debilitating group of inherited neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022).

In conclusion, NAC’s established safety profile, dual antioxidant mechanism, promising preclinical efficacy in models of peripheral neurotoxicity, and its potential to restore critical paranodal junction components all support its further evaluation as a treatment for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Rigorous future studies addressing optimal dosing, mechanistic endpoints such as restoration of NF155 and Caspr1 expression, and well-designed randomized controlled trials in genetically stratified patient populations will be pivotal in determining its clinical utility. Therefore, while NAC is not without challenges, its repurposing for CMT represents a scientifically sound and potentially transformative direction for our drug development pipeline (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; Stochelski, 2018; Hichor et al., 2018).
