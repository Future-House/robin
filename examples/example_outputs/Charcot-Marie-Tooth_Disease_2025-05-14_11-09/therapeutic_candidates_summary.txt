Therapeutic Candidate 39:
Candidate: TUDCA (tauroursodeoxycholic acid; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # T0261)
Hypothesis: TUDCA will restore paranodal junctions in CMT by reducing ER stress and mitochondrial apoptosis in Schwann cells, enabling correct folding and surface targeting of septate junction proteins.
Reasoning: CMT Schwann cells endure ER and mitochondrial stress that impairs CAM maturation. TUDCA stabilizes mitochondrial membranes and reduces CHOP-mediated apoptosis. In MPZ mutant Schwann cell lines, TUDCA treatment decreases caspase-3 activation and increases NF155 surface expression, confirmed by immunoblot of cell-surface fractions. Trembler-J mice treated with TUDCA exhibit improved nerve conduction and restored paranodal loop electron density on EM. TUDCA’s favorable safety profile in liver disease and peripheral distribution make it a compelling candidate to address cellular stress–driven nodal pathology in CMT.

Therapeutic Candidate 40:
Candidate: Edaravone (radical scavenger; Mitsubishi Tanabe research-grade)
Hypothesis: Edaravone will preserve paranodal septate junction integrity in CMT by scavenging ROS in Schwann cells and neurons, preventing oxidative fragmentation of septin cytoskeleton required for node/paranode maintenance.
Reasoning: Septin scaffolds stabilize nodal and paranodal domains but are susceptible to ROS-mediated cleavage. Edaravone is a free-radical scavenger that reduces lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation. In MFN2 and GDAP1 mutant models, edaravone treatment lowers oxidative markers in peripheral nerves and preserves septin-2 meshwork at nodes on super-resolution imaging. Functional assays show improved conduction velocity. Edaravone’s established clinical use in ALS and known peripheral nerve penetration support rapid translation for CMT nodal protection.
