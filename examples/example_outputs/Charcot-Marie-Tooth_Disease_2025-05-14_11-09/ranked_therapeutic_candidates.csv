CKD-504 (HDAC6 inhibitor; ChemDiv catalog # 05-2951),"Proposal for CKD-504 (HDAC6 inhibitor; ChemDiv catalog # 05-2951)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
CKD-504 is a novel, highly selective synthetic inhibitor that targets histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), an enzyme predominantly localized in the cytoplasm that regulates the acetylation state of non-histone proteins such as α-tubulin and HSP90. The compound belongs to the hydroxamic acid subclass of HDAC inhibitors and has been designed to be CNS-penetrant, ensuring that it crosses the blood–brain barrier to effectively engage its target within both central and peripheral nerve tissues (Ha et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023). CKD-504 was synthesized with the intent to improve upon earlier HDAC6 inhibitors by achieving superior selectivity, optimal pharmacokinetics, and reduced systemic toxicity. As opposed to pan-HDAC inhibitors that affect nuclear histone acetylation and often lead to widespread off-target effects, CKD-504 displays robust specificity for HDAC6, which minimizes interference with histone acetylation and other nuclear processes, thereby reducing potential side effects (Ha et al., 2020; Benoy et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
HDAC6 inhibitors, as a class, have generated considerable interest in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and peripheral neuropathies because of their ability to enhance the acetylation of α-tubulin, thereby stabilizing microtubules and promoting intracellular transport. Previous studies have widely documented that selective inhibition of HDAC6 reversed axonal transport deficits and rescued neuromuscular function in preclinical models of neurodegeneration, including mutant models of Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and various forms of Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease (Ha et al., 2020; Benoy et al., 2017; Tavares et al., 2021). In Schwann cell–dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co-culture systems derived from CMT models, HDAC6 inhibitors have demonstrated the capacity to rescue myelination deficits while increasing axonal transport velocities and acetyl-α-tubulin levels, correlating with improved axoglial and paranodal architecture. Although CKD-504 itself has been primarily evaluated in neurodegenerative contexts such as Huntington’s disease models, where it reduced pathogenic protein aggregation and improved motor outcomes, its mechanistic properties suggest a potential repurposing for CMT therapies (Ha et al., 2020; Morena et al., 2019). Phase I safety data and preclinical PK/PD studies from related studies with CNS-penetrant HDAC6 inhibitors support further investigation of CKD-504 in CMT, though to date direct clinical applications in CMT or similar peripheral neuropathies have not been fully reported (Ha et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, CKD-504 exerts its therapeutic effect through selective inhibition of HDAC6’s deacetylase activity. HDAC6 normally deacetylates several non-histone substrates such as α-tubulin and HSP90. Inhibition of HDAC6 by CKD-504 results in increased levels of acetylated α-tubulin, a post-translational modification that directly correlates with microtubule stabilization. Stable microtubules facilitate the correct binding and processivity of motor proteins like kinesin-1 and dynein, which are responsible for anterograde and retrograde transport, respectively, along axons (Ha et al., 2020; Benoy et al., 2017). This enhanced axonal transport is crucial for the delivery of critical cargo, including mitochondria, synaptic vesicles, and proteins involved in myelination such as the paranodal proteins Caspr1 and Contactin-1. The clustering of these proteins at paranodal junctions is essential for maintaining axoglial integrity and proper node of Ranvier assembly, ultimately ensuring effective saltatory conduction (Ha et al., 2020; English & Barton, 2021).
In addition to its role in regulating microtubule dynamics, HDAC6 inhibition by CKD-504 may indirectly modulate the activity of molecular chaperones, such as boosting HSP70 expression through the acetylation of HSP90. This cascade of events contributes to improved proteostasis by reducing pathological protein aggregation—in the context of CMT1A, for example, by lowering PMP22 aggregates—and facilitates proper cellular responses to misfolded proteins (Ha et al., 2020; Benoy et al., 2017). Moreover, by facilitating axonal transport and ensuring the efficient delivery of paranodal constituents, HDAC6 inhibition supports the structural restoration of axoglial junctions. While direct experimental evidence on the modulation of paranodal protein clustering by CKD-504 is emerging, indirect support from related HDAC6 inhibitors that show normalized paranodal architecture in Schwann cell and DRG models buttresses the hypothesis that CKD-504 will have similar effects (Ha et al., 2020; Benoy et al., 2017; Morena et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assays employing Schwann cell–dorsal root ganglion co-cultures that model Charcot–Marie–Tooth pathology, the administration of CKD-504 is expected to produce several beneficial effects. First, by selectively inhibiting HDAC6, CKD-504 should result in a significant increase in acetyl-α-tubulin levels within the peripheral nerve and Schwann cell cytoplasm (Ha et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023). This biochemical change will stabilize microtubules and enhance the intracellular transport of organelles and proteins. The stabilization is hypothesized to facilitate the efficient delivery and proper localization of critical paranodal proteins such as Caspr1 and Contactin-1 to their native clusters at the node/paranode interface, which in turn will support the reformation of the nodal domain and restoration of axoglial integrity (Ha et al., 2020; English & Barton, 2021).
Second, improved axonal transport is expected to enhance mitochondrial motility and overall axonal health, which are compromised in CMT due to defective microtubule dynamics. Enhanced transport will likely result in improved electrophysiological parameters, measured by increases in motor nerve conduction velocity and compound muscle action potential amplitudes as observed in preclinical models treated with selective HDAC6 inhibitors (Benoy et al., 2017; Ha et al., 2020). Additionally, by reducing the accumulation of pathological protein aggregates such as PMP22 in the case of CMT1A, CKD-504 may contribute to a favorable shift in the proteostasis environment within Schwann cells, potentially leading to a normalization of myelin thickness and internodal length (Ha et al., 2020; Morena et al., 2019).
Finally, in animal models, these cellular and molecular improvements are expected to translate into functional benefits such as enhanced motor coordination, improved grip strength, and better behavioral outcomes as measured by rotarod and balance beam tests in transgenic mouse models of CMT (Ha et al., 2020; Benoy et al., 2017). These endpoints provide a strong translational rationale for CKD-504’s further development as a therapeutic candidate for CMT.

Overall Evaluation:
CKD-504 emerges as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease based on its robust biochemical, preclinical, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Its major strengths include its high potency and selectivity towards HDAC6, ensuring that it specifically targets the deacetylation of α-tubulin and relevant cytoplasmic substrates without significantly interfering with nuclear histone acetylation (Ha et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023). This selectivity is critical because it minimizes potential off-target effects that have historically burdened other classes of HDAC inhibitors and contributes to a favorable safety profile, as supported by existing Phase I data and preclinical safety evaluations (Ha et al., 2020; Shen & Kozikowski, 2020).
Moreover, the mechanistic rationale behind CKD-504’s use in CMT is compelling. By increasing acetyl-α-tubulin levels, CKD-504 stabilizes microtubules, thereby enhancing axonal transport processes that are disrupted in CMT. Improved axonal transport is not only essential for the effective delivery of mitochondria, vesicles, and other critical organelles but also for ensuring the proper trafficking and clustering of paranodal proteins such as Caspr1 and Contactin-1. These proteins are essential for maintaining the integrity of the axoglial junctions and for preserving the nodal architecture required for efficient nerve conduction (Ha et al., 2020; English & Barton, 2021).
A further strength lies in the accumulating preclinical evidence from various HDAC6 inhibitors, which consistently show rescue of axonal transport deficits and improvements in myelination in models of peripheral neuropathy and neurodegenerative disease (Benoy et al., 2017; Morena et al., 2019). These observations strongly support the hypothesis that CKD-504 will not only ameliorate defective axonal transport but also foster the proper assembly of paranodal protein clusters, thereby restoring axoglial integrity and promoting nerve repair.
Nonetheless, some weaknesses and uncertainties remain. Direct data regarding CKD-504’s effects on the clustering of paranodal proteins such as Caspr1 and Contactin-1 are still preliminary, and further detailed mechanistic studies are needed to confirm that its modulation of microtubule acetylation translates into restored paranodal architecture in vivo (Ha et al., 2020). In addition, although the candidate has demonstrated promising CNS penetration and target engagement in related neurodegenerative models, comprehensive safety data specific to prolonged administration in CMT models need to be gathered to ensure its long-term tolerability, especially given the chronic nature of CMT (Ha et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
Further clinical trial data will be necessary to determine whether the improvements observed in biomarker endpoints, such as increased acetyl-α-tubulin levels and improved axonal transport, will translate into meaningful clinical benefits in CMT patients. The promising preclinical PK/PD profile and the existing safety data from Phase I studies provide a solid foundation, yet rigorous clinical testing in well-designed trials will be essential to conclusively establish efficacy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Regenacy Pharmaceuticals LLC, 2020).
In summary, CKD-504 displays an excellent balance of pharmacological activity, target specificity, and brain penetration that makes it a strong candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. The underlying hypothesis that CKD-504 will improve axoglial integrity in CMT by enhancing microtubule-based transport and promoting the proper localization of paranodal proteins is well supported by current biochemical and preclinical evidence (Ha et al., 2020; Benoy et al., 2017; Morena et al., 2019). While further work is needed to directly evaluate its effects on paranodal protein clustering and long-term clinical outcomes, the strengths of this candidate outweigh the potential limitations, and CKD-504 warrants continued development and clinical investigation as a novel therapeutic approach for CMT.

I.","Proposal for Recombinant Human Neuregulin-1β1 EGF-like Domain (rhNRG1β1; R&D Systems catalog # 396-NR)

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of recombinant human neuregulin‐1β1 (rhNRG1β1) with its EGF‐like domain as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease. This review covers the origins and classification of the candidate, its therapeutic history, the detailed mechanism of action, the expected effects in relevant assays and disease models, and an overall evaluation with its strengths and weaknesses. All sections are supported by literature evidence drawn exclusively from the provided context.

I. Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Recombinant human neuregulin‐1β1 (rhNRG1β1) is an engineered protein that reproduces the biologically active fragment of the endogenous neuregulin‐1 form. This candidate is produced by expressing the β1 isoform of neuregulin‐1, specifically containing its critical EGF‐like domain that is essential for binding to ErbB receptors. Neuregulin‐1 is a ligand that naturally mediates cell–cell communication and tissue regeneration by engaging receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly from the ErbB family. In its recombinant form, rhNRG1β1 is synthesized through molecular cloning in an appropriate expression system, typically mammalian cells, which allows for post‐translational modifications that closely mimic the native protein. As such, it belongs to the class of recombinant protein therapeutics that have historically been developed for applications in regenerative medicine and are known to be effective when their dosing and distribution are controlled. This approach is exemplified by the widespread use of growth factors across various therapeutic areas including cardiovascular repair and acute injury models, where proteins that activate specific signaling cascades are employed to restore tissue function (Cespedes et al., 2018). The rationale for repurposing rhNRG1β1 for CMT stems from its known ability to engage ErbB receptors that play a pivotal role in Schwann cell function and myelination, a critical consideration given the demyelinating nature of CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

II. Therapeutic History
The therapeutic history of recombinant neuregulin‐1 variants is extensive and underpinned by both preclinical studies and early clinical trials in non‐neurological indications. Various recombinant forms of neuregulin‐1 have been evaluated in preclinical models for their ability to influence tissue repair. For instance, endogenous neuregulin‐1 has been shown to be essential for Schwann cell survival, differentiation, and proper myelination during development and after nerve injury, suggesting that exogenously administered recombinant neuregulin‐1 can modulate peripheral nerve biology (Fricker & Bennett, 2011). Preclinical work in rodent models, including transgenic animals that mimic aspects of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, has illustrated that neuregulin‐1 administration improves remyelination and axonal conduction by modulating ErbB receptor phosphorylation and intracellular signaling pathways. Studies in transgenic models have demonstrated that early treatment with neuregulin‐1 can normalize ErbB2 phosphorylation levels, restore actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and promote the reestablishment of paranodal junctions, as confirmed by ultrastructural data such as electron microscopy (Scapin et al., 2019). Furthermore, in models of nerve injury and experimental demyelination, administration of neuregulin‐1 or its derivatives has been associated with improved nerve conduction velocity and better compound muscle action potentials (CMAP), outcomes that are directly relevant to the clinical manifestations of CMT (Hajjar, 2018). Although most of these preclinical studies have been designed to address the biology of peripheral nerve repair, recombinant neuregulin‐1 derivatives have also been evaluated in human clinical trials for cardiac indications. For example, several clinical trials carried out in the context of heart failure – such as those with endpoints measuring left ventricular function – have confirmed that recombinant neuregulin‐1 is safe in humans and exhibits favorable pharmacokinetic properties (Sawyer & Caggiano, 2011; Cespedes et al., 2018). To date, there are no published clinical trial data directly testing rhNRG1β1 in CMT patients; however, the wealth of preclinical evidence in rodent models of demyelinating neuropathies strongly supports the potential utility of this compound when repurposed for CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

III. Mechanism of Action
The mechanism by which rhNRG1β1 is proposed to exert its therapeutic effects is based on its ability to mimic the biological activity of endogenous neuregulin‐1 and to activate canonical ErbB receptor complexes on Schwann cells. Under physiological circumstances, neuregulin‐1 signals via receptor heterodimers composed primarily of ErbB2 and ErbB3 on the surface of Schwann cells. Binding of the EGF‐like domain of neuregulin‐1 to these receptors induces dimerization, which then triggers tyrosine autophosphorylation of the intracellular domains of the receptors. This phosphorylation cascade creates docking sites for proteins that initiate downstream signaling pathways, most notably the PI3K/Akt cascade (Fricker & Bennett, 2011; Scapin et al., 2019).

Activation of PI3K catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, thereby recruiting and activating Akt. The Akt pathway then promotes cellular survival, growth, and differentiation. In Schwann cells, activation of Akt is critical for inducing cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for proper myelination. Specifically, the dynamic regulation of actin filaments under Akt signaling is essential for the formation and maintenance of paranodal loops. These structures are responsible for the compartmentalization of ion channels and for establishing the precise localization of proteins such as neurofascin 155 (NF155) on the glial side and caspr1 on the axonal side at paranodal junctions (Scapin et al., 2019).

Beyond the PI3K/Akt pathway, neuregulin‐1 binding to ErbB receptors also facilitates activation of additional cascades including the MAPK/ERK pathway and calcineurin/NFAT pathways, which further contribute to gene expression programs that regulate Schwann cell differentiation and myelin production (Fricker & Bennett, 2011). Collectively, these signaling pathways modulate the actin cytoskeleton and control transcriptional programs needed for the synthesis of myelin proteins and lipids. In the context of CMT, where paranodal architecture is disrupted and myelin integrity is compromised, administration of rhNRG1β1 is expected to normalize the downstream signaling events, leading to proper actin reorganization and restoration of paranodal protein complexes. Preclinical studies have provided evidence that exogenous neuregulin‐1 can indeed normalize ErbB2 phosphorylation and the actin cytoskeletal balance in Schwann cells, correlating with improvements in nodal/paranodal structures as seen in electron microscopy analyses (Scapin et al., 2019; Fricker & Bennett, 2011). This precise engagement of ErbB2/3 receptors is central to the candidate’s proposed mechanism, as it triggers intracellular events that facilitate remyelination and the reestablishment of proper paranodal junctions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

IV. Expected Effect
The expected effect of rhNRG1β1 administration in a CMT context is based on improvements both at the molecular and functional levels that address core aspects of the neuropathology. First, by engaging ErbB2/3 receptors on Schwann cells, rhNRG1β1 is hypothesized to restore normal phosphorylation dynamics. In pathological states such as CMT, disrupted ErbB2/3 signaling has been associated with aberrant cytoskeletal organization and improper localization of paranodal proteins. Reducing these abnormalities will likely lead to restoration of paranodal architecture, as evidenced by improved alignment and clustering of NF155 and caspr1 at nerve domains critical for saltatory conduction (Scapin et al., 2019; Fricker & Bennett, 2011).

Second, since Schwann cells rely on accurate intracellular signaling for differentiation and myelin formation, activation of PI3K/Akt signaling by rhNRG1β1 should boost remyelination and enhance the reconstruction of paranodal loops. Experimental models of nerve injury and CMT have demonstrated that treatment with neuregulin‐1 leads to increased Schwann cell proliferation, enhanced actin reorganization, and subsequent improvements in myelin sheath thickness. These structural improvements are directly linked to functional outcomes such as increased nerve conduction velocity and better compound muscle action potential amplitudes (Hajjar, 2018; Scapin et al., 2019).

Third, the pharmacokinetic profile of recombinant neuregulin‐1 preparations—as seen in clinical studies in heart failure—suggests that when administered systemically, the compound is capable of reaching peripheral nerve tissues. This distribution is crucial because it ensures that sufficient local concentrations of rhNRG1β1 are available to activate ErbB receptors on Schwann cells in regions affected by demyelination. Although most clinical studies so far have focused on cardiac endpoints, they demonstrate a safe window for systemic administration that can be adapted for targeting peripheral nerves (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In CMT disease models, one would expect that treatment with rhNRG1β1 would lead to normalization of the disorganized paranodal junctions that are typically seen in these neuropathies. Electron microscopy studies in animal models have shown that neuregulin‐1 administration can reestablish paranodal loops and improve the localization of key adhesion proteins. Functionally, these improvements are anticipated to translate to enhanced saltatory conduction along nerve fibers, resulting in clinically demonstrable benefits such as increased nerve conduction velocity, enhanced muscle responses, and, ultimately, improvements in motor function. Furthermore, the candidates’ activation of downstream cytoskeletal pathways could stabilize Schwann cell-axon interactions, thereby contributing to longer-term preservation of nerve integrity even in the face of ongoing pathogenic challenges (Scapin et al., 2019; Gambarotta et al., 2013).

V. Overall Evaluation
Overall, recombinant human neuregulin‐1β1 represents a compelling candidate for repurposing as a treatment for CMT due to its well-established role in activating the neuregulin/ErbB pathway in Schwann cells and promoting myelination. The scientific rationale for its use in CMT is robust, drawing from both detailed mechanistic studies and preclinical models that collectively indicate several key points:

• rhNRG1β1 specifically targets ErbB2/3 receptors on Schwann cells, thereby initiating a cascade of intracellular events including the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and downstream cytoskeletal reorganization. This mechanism is critical for the restoration of paranodal junction integrity as the proper localization of NF155 and caspr1 is dependent on these signaling events (Fricker & Bennett, 2011; Scapin et al., 2019).

• Preclinical evidence, primarily derived from transgenic rodent models of demyelinating neuropathies, demonstrates that neuregulin‐1 administration not only normalizes ErbB2 phosphorylation but also results in measurable improvements in nerve conduction and myelination. Electron microscopic analyses from these studies reveal that paranodal structures are realigned after treatment, and electrophysiological recordings show enhanced nerve conduction velocity and compound muscle action potentials (Scapin et al., 2019; Hajjar, 2018).

• The favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles established in analogous clinical trials – especially those conducted in cardiac patients – provide a strong translational foundation. Although these studies were not conducted in a neuropathic context, the systemic administration of recombinant neuregulin‐1 has been shown to be well tolerated in humans and is associated with evidence of target engagement via ErbB receptor activation (Sawyer & Caggiano, 2011; Cespedes et al., 2018).

• The candidate’s mechanism of action, which leverages the intrinsic biology of Schwann cells, directly addresses a fundamental aspect of CMT pathology. Since CMT is characterized by demyelination and abnormal paranodal junction architecture, the ability of rhNRG1β1 to restore actin cytoskeletal balance and to reestablish the proper clustering of paranodal proteins is highly relevant. This targeted approach could ultimately lead to improved clinical outcomes in patients by enhancing nerve conduction and overall neuromuscular function (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, there are important limitations to consider in this evaluation:

• Although abundant preclinical data support the potential of neuregulin‐1 in modulating myelination and paranodal architecture, direct clinical evidence of efficacy in CMT patients is lacking. Most clinical data for recombinant neuregulin‐1 have been derived from studies in cardiac populations, and it remains to be determined whether similar beneficial effects can be replicated in a peripheral neuropathy setting (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

• The therapeutic intervention must achieve precise modulation of ErbB receptor activity; both hypoactivation and hyperactivation can have deleterious consequences. Thus, careful titration of rhNRG1β1 dosing will be critical, especially because aberrant ErbB2 phosphorylation has been linked to pathological outcomes in experimental models (Fricker & Bennett, 2011).

• While pharmacokinetic studies in cardiac settings suggest acceptable systemic exposure, the ability of rhNRG1β1 to reach effective concentrations in peripheral nerve tissues and reliably cross barriers to access the target Schwann cells must be confirmed through dedicated pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies in models that mimic the human condition (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

• CMT is a heterogeneous disease that involves not only demyelination but also significant axonal degeneration in some cases. It is possible that while rhNRG1β1 may be effective in restoring myelin integrity and paranodal junctions, additional interventions might be necessary to fully address axonal loss and ensure long-term functional recovery. Combination therapies may ultimately prove more efficacious than a single-agent approach (Cespedes et al., 2018).

In summary, the multifaceted literature evidence strongly supports the rationale for repurposing rhNRG1β1 as a therapeutic candidate for CMT. Its capacity to engage ErbB2/3 receptors on Schwann cells, normalize critical intracellular signaling cascades such as the PI3K/Akt pathway, and restore the structural integrity of paranodal junctions offers a clear mechanistic link to the pathogenesis of CMT. Improvements in nerve conduction velocity and CMAP observed in preclinical studies further underscore its potential to yield functional benefits. Moreover, the established human safety profile of recombinant neuregulin‐1 from cardiovascular trials provides a significant translational advantage that could accelerate its clinical development for neuropathic indications.

Nonetheless, the path forward requires addressing several key gaps. Rigorous preclinical studies focusing on the direct effects of rhNRG1β1 on paranodal junction proteins—specifically NF155 and caspr1—as well as comprehensive electrophysiological assessments in animal models that recapitulate the human CMT phenotype, are critical. In addition, studies examining the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of rhNRG1β1 in the peripheral nervous system must be prioritized to ensure that the necessary therapeutic levels are achievable in affected nerves. Determining the optimal dosing regimen and defining the therapeutic window to avoid potential off-target effects will be essential steps before clinical translation can be considered.

Overall, based on the current evidence, recombinant human neuregulin‐1β1 exhibits significant promise as a repurposed agent for CMT. Its strong mechanistic foundation, combined with encouraging preclinical results in terms of paranodal restoration and electrophysiological improvement, support further investigation. Our recommendation is to advance toward targeted preclinical studies in well-characterized CMT models—employing detailed ultrastructural analyses, molecular endpoint validation, and functional nerve assessments—and to design early-phase clinical trials upon demonstration of efficacy in these models. Given the depth of available data linking ErbB signaling to Schwann cell function and myelination, rhNRG1β1 could become a transformative therapy for patients suffering from demyelinating neuropathies such as CMT, provided that subsequent studies overcome the challenges of optimal delivery and dosage (Scapin et al., 2019; Fricker & Bennett, 2011).

In conclusion, while additional research is needed to firmly establish its clinical utility in CMT, the combination of a well-defined mechanism, promising preclinical outcomes, and a favorable safety background from previous cardiovascular studies positions rhNRG1β1 as a highly promising candidate. Moving forward, the strategic focus should be on addressing the pharmacokinetic profile in peripheral nerves, confirming the restoration of paranodal junction integrity at the molecular level, and thoroughly evaluating electrophysiological improvements in validated animal models of CMT. This rational and stepwise approach will help bridge the gap between promising laboratory findings and eventual clinical efficacy, offering hope for improved outcomes in patients with Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cespedes et al., 2018).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is a bile acid derivative that naturally originates as the taurine‐conjugated form of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Initially discovered in the bile of bears and employed in traditional Chinese medicine, TUDCA is now synthesized by the chemical conjugation of UDCA with taurine, enabling large‐scale production for pharmaceutical applications (Kusaczuk, 2019). Belonging to a class of hydrophilic bile acids, TUDCA is traditionally used as a hepatoprotective and choleretic agent as well as a chemical chaperone that modulates the unfolded protein response (UPR), thereby reducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Kusaczuk, 2019; Khalaf et al., 2022). This class of compounds has historically been well known for its utility in treating cholestatic liver diseases, where they improve bile flow and protect hepatocytes, and recent investigations have expanded their role into neuroprotection based on their ability to stabilize protein folding and mitigate cellular stress (Jia, 2009; Kusaczuk, 2019).

Therapeutic History:
In terms of therapeutic history, TUDCA has been extensively used in the context of hepatobiliary diseases. It is used clinically in some European countries and in China for conditions such as primary biliary cirrhosis and cholesterol gallstones (Jia, 2009; Kusaczuk, 2019). Over the past decade, there has been growing interest in repurposing TUDCA for neurodegenerative conditions because of its potent anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and ER stress-reducing properties; clinical trials have been conducted in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in experimental models of Huntington’s and Parkinson’s diseases (Albanese, 2008; Khalaf et al., 2022; Boatright et al., 2019). Although there are no formal clinical trials specifically targeting Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) to date, several preclinical studies and exploratory clinical investigations in related neuropathic conditions suggest that TUDCA’s mechanistic actions may prove beneficial for demyelinating diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kusaczuk, 2019). Moreover, veterinary applications of bile acids have been reported in liver diseases of companion animals, though formal approval for neuropathies in either human or veterinary contexts remains investigational (Goland, 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of TUDCA’s action involves its role as a chemical chaperone that alleviates ER stress by enhancing the proper folding of proteins, thus mitigating the unfolded protein response (UPR) and preventing the activation of pro-apoptotic pathways such as CHOP-dependent cascades (Kusaczuk, 2019). In addition, TUDCA exerts a robust anti-apoptotic effect by stabilizing mitochondrial membranes; it prevents mitochondrial permeability transition, reduces cytochrome c release, and inhibits caspase-3 activation, thereby reducing apoptosis in stressed cells (Ackerman & Gerhard, 2016; Chen et al., 2022). These molecular actions include modulation of key signaling pathways such as Akt, MAPK, and PI3K, which are essential for cell survival under stress conditions (Khalaf et al., 2022). Importantly, in Schwann cells—whose dysfunction is central to CMT pathology—ER stress and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis impair the maturation and surface trafficking of critical cell adhesion molecules, notably septate junction proteins like neurofascin 155 (NF155) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kusaczuk, 2019). Preclinical models using MPZ mutant Schwann cell lines have shown that TUDCA treatment leads to reduced caspase-3 activation and restored NF155 surface expression, underscoring its ability to normalize the trafficking of adhesion molecules required for paranodal junction integrity (Kusaczuk, 2019; Khalaf et al., 2022). Furthermore, experimental data in Trembler-J mice—a well-established model for CMT—indicate that TUDCA improves nerve conduction velocity and restores paranodal loop electron density as observed by electron microscopy, which strongly suggests a preservation of paranodal junction architecture (Boatright et al., 2019; Khalaf et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
Based on the proposed hypothesis, TUDCA is expected to exert a therapeutic effect in CMT by restoring the integrity of paranodal junctions in peripheral nerves. This effect is primarily achieved through the reduction of ER stress and mitochondrial apoptosis in Schwann cells, thereby fostering correct folding and enhanced surface targeting of septate junction proteins like NF155 (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kusaczuk, 2019). In vitro assays using MPZ mutant Schwann cell lines have demonstrated that TUDCA treatment decreases caspase-3 activation—a marker of cellular apoptosis—and concurrently increases the surface expression of NF155, as measured by immunoblot analyses of cell surface fractions (Chen et al., 2022; Kusaczuk, 2019). In in vivo rodent models such as the Trembler-J mouse, TUDCA administration has been documented to lead to improved nerve conduction as well as restoration of paranodal loop electron density on electron microscopy, which is indicative of normalized paranodal junction formation and enhanced axon-Schwann cell interactions (Khalaf et al., 2022; Boatright et al., 2019). These combined actions aim to reverse the pathogenic mechanisms in CMT where chronic ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in Schwann cells impede the proper assembly of cell adhesion molecules necessary for proper nerve conduction (Kusaczuk, 2019; Khalaf et al., 2022). Additionally, TUDCA’s favorable pharmacokinetic profile—including its peripheral distribution and established safety in liver disease—further supports its candidacy as a repurposed treatment in a chronic neuropathic condition like CMT (Jia, 2009; Boatright et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, TUDCA represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease based on a multifaceted preclinical rationale. Its naturally derived origin from UDCA, enhanced by chemical conjugation with taurine, places it within a well-characterized class of bile acids with proven hepatoprotective and neuroprotective properties (Kusaczuk, 2019). Strengths of TUDCA include its robust ability to act as a chemical chaperone, reducing ER stress and preventing misfolded protein accumulation—a mechanism that is critically relevant to Schwann cell dysfunction in CMT (Kusaczuk, 2019; Khalaf et al., 2022). Additionally, its capacity to stabilize mitochondrial membranes and inhibit apoptotic signaling via caspase inhibition has been well documented in both neuronal and hepatocellular models (Ackerman & Gerhard, 2016; Chen et al., 2022). Preclinical evidence demonstrating improved NF155 surface expression and restored paranodal junction architecture in MPZ mutant Schwann cells and Trembler-J mice provides compelling support for its potential to reverse the cellular deficits observed in CMT (Kusaczuk, 2019; Khalaf et al., 2022). Furthermore, the extensive safety profile of TUDCA from its use in hepatobiliary conditions, along with its favorable bioavailability and peripheral distribution, reinforces the translational feasibility of repurposing this agent for neuropathic conditions (Jia, 2009; Boatright et al., 2019).

Nevertheless, there are notable weaknesses and challenges to consider. Despite promising preclinical data and mechanistic rationale, direct clinical evidence supporting the use of TUDCA in CMT is currently lacking; no clinical trials have been explicitly designed to investigate its efficacy in demyelinating neuropathies such as CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, while the data from MPZ mutant Schwann cell studies and Trembler-J mouse models are encouraging, the heterogeneity of CMT and variability in its genetic underpinnings may complicate translational outcomes. The optimal dosing regimen for achieving effective concentration in peripheral nerves without eliciting off-target effects remains to be established. Additionally, it is not yet clear whether the improvements in paranodal junction structure and function observed in animal models will translate into clinically meaningful outcomes in patients with CMT, such as functional motor and sensory improvements (Khalaf et al., 2022; Kusaczuk, 2019).

Overall, TUDCA’s multifactorial mechanism—encompassing ER stress reduction, mitochondrial membrane stabilization, and promotion of correct surface targeting of septate junction proteins—provides a solid biochemical foundation for its potential efficacy in treating CMT. The candidate demonstrates significant strengths in preclinical models that recapitulate key aspects of Schwann cell pathology in CMT. Its extensive clinical use in hepatobiliary disorders and emerging use in neurodegenerative disease contexts further support its repositioning for neuropathies. However, the transition from preclinical promise to clinical utility in CMT will require well-designed studies to address dosing strategies, patient selection, and long-term safety in the context of a chronic demyelinating disease. Based on the current literature and mechanistic insights, TUDCA merits further investigation as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for CMT, with the potential to restore paranodal junction integrity by alleviating ER and mitochondrial stress in Schwann cells (Kusaczuk, 2019; Khalaf et al., 2022).

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of fasudil (HA-1077; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # F1620) as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. In the sections that follow, we appraise its synthetic origins and chemical class, review its historic therapeutic applications in both vascular and neurological settings, detail its molecular mechanism of action with respect to ROCK inhibition, discuss the expected effects on paranodal junction integrity in the context of demyelinating pathology, and conclude with an overall evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses for potential use in CMT.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Fasudil is a synthetic small-molecule drug developed from an isoquinoline sulfonylamide scaffold. Its initial synthesis involved converting fasudil hydrochloride to the free base, then employing chemical protection strategies (for example, Boc-protection) followed by oxidation and subsequent derivatization steps such as benzoylation and alkylation with a 4-nitrobenzyl bromide. These synthetic manipulations yielded a compound with a defined isoquinoline ring structure conjugated through a sulfonyl linker to a homopiperazine moiety. Fasudil belongs to the therapeutic class of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitors that act by competitively binding to the ATP-binding pocket of ROCK enzymes. This binding impedes the kinase’s ability to phosphorylate downstream substrates involved in actin-myosin contractility. Fasudil is thus regarded as a prototypical ROCK inhibitor that has been extensively studied over the past few decades; such agents have historically been used as vasodilators to ameliorate conditions like cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as in experimental models of neuroprotection (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013). The molecule’s chemical structure, with specific emphasis on the isoquinoline core and its homopiperazine appendage, provides critical interactions with the catalytic domains of ROCK enzymes. As such, the synthetic origins and chemical modifications of fasudil have been optimized for robust kinase inhibition, as evidenced by subsequent analyses using methods such as NMR, HPLC, and mass spectrometry (Al-Hilal et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History
Fasudil was first introduced clinically in Japan, where it was approved for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. In its primary indication, fasudil exerts vasodilatory effects through inhibition of vascular smooth muscle contraction mediated by ROCK. Over the years, extensive clinical data have been accumulated regarding its safety, pharmacokinetics, and tissue distribution. Fasudil has not only been applied in cerebral vasospasm but has also been investigated in a variety of vascular disorders such as angina pectoris, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and stable effort angina—all conditions where reduction in vascular tone is therapeutically beneficial (Chen et al., 2013; Dong et al., 2010). In addition, preclinical studies have documented fasudil’s neuroprotective effects. Investigational studies in models of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and even compassionate use trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have yielded encouraging results. These studies demonstrate that ROCK inhibition by fasudil leads to improvements in neuronal survival and functional recovery in various central nervous system (CNS) injury models (Koch et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2007). Importantly, although fasudil has not been directly tested in clinical trials involving Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, preclinical investigations in rodent models—specifically CMT1A transgenic rats—have shown that systemic administration of fasudil increases internodal length and enhances nerve conduction velocities. In those studies, biochemical markers such as reduced phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) in peripheral nerves were observed, and ultrastructural analyses confirmed the restoration of paranodal loop adhesion and the reformation of septate junctions (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013). These findings provide the rationale for further exploration of fasudil in demyelinating peripheral neuropathies, particularly in the context of CMT (Chen et al., 2013).

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, fasudil acts as a competitive inhibitor of Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCK1 and ROCK2) through its interaction with the ATP-binding pocket on the enzyme’s catalytic domain. Detailed structural analyses have shown that the isoquinoline ring of fasudil occupies the adenine subsite of the kinase domain, forming key hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues essential for catalytic activity (Mueller et al., 2005). Meanwhile, the attached homopiperazine moiety engages with hydrophobic regions adjacent to the ATP-binding site. This dual interaction significantly inhibits the kinase’s ability to phosphorylate downstream targets such as myosin light chain (MLC) and myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1). The inhibition of MLC phosphorylation directly translates into a reduction in actomyosin contractility, a process central to the pathophysiology of vascular contraction and cytoskeletal dynamics (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013).

Of particular interest in the context of CMT is the role of ROCK—especially the isoform ROCK2—in regulating the cytoskeletal tension of Schwann cells. Schwann cells are responsible for myelinating peripheral axons and for maintaining the specialized structures known as paranodal junctions. These junctions are formed by a complex involving Caspr1, Contactin, and Neurofascin, which are essential for saltatory conduction. Under pathological conditions seen in CMT, aberrant ROCK activity leads to excessive phosphorylation of MLC, inducing hypercontractility in Schwann cells. This increase in cortical tension disrupts the proper assembly or maintenance of paranodal junctions, thereby impairing normal nerve conduction (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013). Fasudil, by inhibiting ROCK, decreases MLC phosphorylation, which in turn reduces Schwann cell contractility. The subsequent lowering of cortical tension is hypothesized to facilitate the reestablishment of the critical adhesion complexes required for paranodal integrity (Chen et al., 2013). Furthermore, the active metabolite of fasudil, hydroxyfasudil, exhibits enhanced ROCK inhibitory potency and contributes to the overall pharmacodynamic outcome by extending the duration of ROCK inhibition (Dong et al., 2010; Halasz & Townes-Anderson, 2016).

Additionally, it is important to note that while fasudil is not completely selective for ROCK2 and also inhibits ROCK1, the dominant expression of ROCK2 in neural and glial tissues makes its net effect particularly relevant for the peripheral nerve compartments. Biochemical studies have established that reduction in MLC phosphorylation following fasudil treatment is correlated with improved cytoskeletal dynamics and normalized cellular contractility (Chen et al., 2013; Liao et al., 2007). Through these interactions and the subsequent biochemical cascades, fasudil creates a cellular environment conducive to axonal regeneration and remyelination—a critical component in addressing the conduction deficits observed in CMT (Al-Hilal et al., 2021).

Expected Effect
In Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease—particularly the CMT1A subtype—the central pathological feature is the disruption of paranodal junctions that flank the nodes of Ranvier. This disruption is believed to result, at least in part, from an imbalance in the actomyosin contractile apparatus within Schwann cells. An overactive ROCK pathway increases MLC phosphorylation, thereby escalating cortical tension in Schwann cells. The hypothesis under evaluation posits that treatment with fasudil will restore paranodal junction integrity by inhibiting ROCK, effectively reducing MLC phosphorylation and thus decreasing Schwann cell contractility.

Preclinical studies conducted in CMT1A transgenic rats have provided encouraging results that support this hypothesis. Specifically, treated animals exhibited an increase in internodal length and improved nerve conduction velocity, both of which are indicative of enhanced neural function. These functional improvements were accompanied by biochemical evidence showing decreased phosphorylation levels of MLC in peripheral nerves, which serves as a direct marker of effective ROCK inhibition (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013). Furthermore, ultrastructural analyses in these models have revealed a normalization of paranodal loop adhesion and re‐formation of septate junctions, which are critical for maintaining the specialized architecture necessary for rapid and efficient saltatory conduction (Chen et al., 2013; Rayner, 2019).

The ability of fasudil to cross the blood–nerve barrier is also paramount when considering its application in peripheral neuropathies. Pharmacokinetic studies in both vascular and CNS settings have demonstrated that fasudil is capable of reaching therapeutically relevant concentrations in target tissues. This property is especially beneficial in diseases like CMT, where the therapeutic agent must reach and act on Schwann cells residing in peripheral nerves (Dong et al., 2010; Halasz & Townes-Anderson, 2016). Once delivered, the drug’s ROCK inhibition leads to reduced actomyosin contractility, which is not only expected to restore proper paranodal architecture but may also enhance overall axonal regeneration and remyelination. Ultimately, these effects should translate into improved conduction velocities and better functional outcomes for patients suffering from CMT.

Experimental assays designed to evaluate the efficacy of fasudil in CMT would therefore measure multiple endpoints. First, biochemical markers such as phosphorylation levels of MLC would serve as early indicators of ROCK inhibition. In parallel, electrophysiological assessments would determine improvements in nerve conduction velocity, while ultrastructural analyses via electron microscopy would be used to confirm normalization of paranodal junction integrity (Chen et al., 2013; Rayner, 2019). Given that the proper assembly of paranodal proteins like Caspr1, Contactin, and Neurofascin is essential for saltatory conduction, restoration of these complexes is the ultimate goal. The expected cascade, therefore, envisions fasudil lowering ROCK activity, reducing MLC phosphorylation, easing Schwann cell cortical tension, and thereby permitting full reassembly of the paranodal junction (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013).

Overall Evaluation
Fasudil emerges as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, based on several compelling lines of evidence.
One major strength is its well-documented clinical history. Fasudil has been approved and widely used in Japan and other regions for conditions such as cerebral vasospasm and various cardiovascular diseases; this long track record provides a robust database regarding its safety profile, pharmacokinetics, and tissue distribution (Chen et al., 2013; Dong et al., 2010). Such extensive clinical experience significantly de-risks the development process for a new indication like CMT, where the need for effective therapies is high. Moreover, the established ability of fasudil to cross physiological barriers—including the blood–nerve barrier—ensures that it reaches peripheral nerve tissues at concentrations sufficient to inhibit ROCK activity (Dong et al., 2010; Halasz & Townes-Anderson, 2016).

From a mechanistic perspective, the fundamental mode of action of fasudil—namely, its competitive inhibition of the ATP-binding site in ROCK—directly addresses the cellular and molecular aberrations implicated in CMT. By reducing the phosphorylation of MLC, fasudil decreases actomyosin contractility in Schwann cells. This reduction in cytoskeletal tension is hypothesized to permit the reassembly of paranodal junction components, including the Caspr1-Contactin-Neurofascin complex that is often disrupted in CMT. Preclinical evidence from CMT1A transgenic rat models reinforces this notion by showing improvements in internodal length and nerve conduction velocity, alongside biochemical reductions in MLC phosphorylation and ultrastructural normalization of paranodal regions (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013).

Additionally, the dual therapeutic potential of fasudil—encompassing both vascular and neuroprotective effects—is particularly attractive. While its classical use as a vasodilator stems from its action on vascular smooth muscle cells, its capacity to protect neurons and modulate cytoskeletal dynamics in both central and peripheral nerve tissues makes it a versatile agent. This duality might not only help in restoring paranodal integrity but could also promote overall axonal regeneration and remyelination, which are crucial for functional recovery in peripheral neuropathies (Chen et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2020).

However, several challenges must be taken into account in the evaluation of fasudil for CMT. One concern is its lack of absolute selectivity for ROCK2. Fasudil inhibits both ROCK1 and ROCK2; however, given that ROCK2 is believed to be predominantly responsible for the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics in neuronal and glial tissues, its non-selectivity could potentially lead to off-target effects in cell types where ROCK1 is more active. Future development may need to assess whether enhancing isoform selectivity—either by chemical modification of fasudil or by developing next-generation ROCK2 inhibitors—could yield improved efficacy and reduced adverse effects (Chen et al., 2013; Liao et al., 2007).

Another potential limitation is rooted in the fact that chronic inhibition of a kinase as central to fundamental cellular processes as ROCK might lead to unforeseen long-term consequences. Although fasudil’s clinical use in acute settings such as cerebral vasospasm demonstrates favorable short-term safety profiles, CMT is a chronic and progressive disease. Therefore, prolonged treatment with fasudil might pose risks related to sustained alterations in cytoskeletal dynamics. Detailed long-term preclinical studies will be required to evaluate the impact of chronic ROCK inhibition on myelin maintenance, nerve regeneration, and overall Schwann cell physiology (Kim et al., 2020; Olson, 2008).

Furthermore, while decreased MLC phosphorylation is a robust and easily measurable pharmacodynamic marker of ROCK inhibition, it does not capture the full spectrum of potential downstream effects. Peripheral nerve biology is complex, and the modulation of actomyosin contractility might affect not only paranodal junctions but other aspects of Schwann cell function and axonal support. As such, there is a need for comprehensive electrophysiological and ultrastructural assessments in animal models to ascertain not only the immediate biochemical effects but also the sustained functional improvements that translate into clinical benefit for CMT patients (Chen et al., 2013; Rayner, 2019).

Despite these challenges, the convergence of data from diverse experimental models—ranging from vascular and CNS applications to direct preclinical studies in CMT1A transgenic rats—strongly supports the continued investigation of fasudil as a therapeutic agent for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Its ability to restore paranodal junction integrity by modulating cytoskeletal tension in Schwann cells is directly aligned with the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CMT. In addition, the documented improvements in nerve conduction velocity and internodal length provide functional corroboration for its anticipated beneficial effects (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Rayner, 2019).

Overall, fasudil’s extensive clinical use in other indications provides a significant advantage for repurposing it for CMT. Its well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, coupled with its effective penetration into peripheral nerve tissues, offer a promising framework for clinical translation. Mechanistically, the drug’s action by competitively inhibiting ROCK—thereby reducing phosphorylation of key substrates like MLC and alleviating cytoskeletal tension—addresses the core abnormalities in paranodal architecture observed in CMT. These factors, combined with the encouraging preclinical findings in relevant animal models, make fasudil a compelling candidate for further development as a disease-modifying therapy in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

In conclusion, the synthesis, therapeutic history, and molecular mechanism of fasudil all converge to support its potential repurposing for CMT. Its chemical origins as a rationally designed ROCK inhibitor, its proven efficacy in vascular and neuroprotective contexts, and its ability to restore paranodal junction integrity through modulation of actomyosin contractility in Schwann cells collectively argue in favor of its continued evaluation in preclinical and eventually clinical studies for CMT. Nevertheless, further investigations are warranted to optimize isoform selectivity, assess long-term dosing strategies, and thoroughly characterize the functional recovery in chronic animal models of peripheral neuropathy. Should these studies yield favorable outcomes, fasudil may represent a transformative advancement for patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease who currently have very limited therapeutic options (Al-Hilal et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013; Olson, 2008; Rayner, 2019).

Overall, based on the extensive preclinical data and the robust clinical safety record, fasudil is a highly attractive candidate for repurposing in CMT. Its capacity to penetrate the blood–nerve barrier and normalize the Schwann cell cytoskeletal architecture necessary for paranodal junction assembly suggests that it might restore the functional integrity of peripheral nerves and improve conduction velocities. Given the current limitations in CMT treatment, further research into fasudil’s long-term efficacy, optimal dosing, and potential for isoform-specific improvements is highly justified. Continued investment in detailed electrophysiological, ultrastructural, and behavioral studies in animal models, followed by carefully designed phase I/II clinical trials, will determine if fasudil can ultimately fulfill its promise as a new and effective therapy for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Chen et al., 2013; Dong et al., 2010; Rayner, 2019).

Guanabenz (eIF2α phosphatase inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # G0089),"Proposal for Guanabenz (eIF2α phosphatase inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # G0089)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Guanabenz is a synthetic aminoguanidine derivative originally developed as an orally active α2‐adrenergic receptor agonist for treating hypertension. Chemically, it is classified among imidazoline derivatives and is commercially available (for example, via Sigma-Aldrich catalog # G0089). Its chemical structure, described as 2,6-dichlorobenzylidene aminoguanidine acetate, reflects its derivation from guanidine scaffolds used for decades in antihypertensive therapy. Over time, its pharmacology has been re‐examined following discoveries from unbiased yeast‐based screens for anti‐prion agents, which revealed that in addition to its adrenergic actions, guanabenz uniquely modulates cellular stress responses (Claes et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2023). This repositioning placed guanabenz into the class of compounds that affect proteostasis by targeting the integrated stress response (ISR) through inhibition of eIF2α phosphatase activity. The repurposing effort is grounded on its ability to modulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress—a pivotal pathogenic factor in various neurodegenerative disorders and peripheral neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease.

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Guanabenz has been used clinically as an antihypertensive agent with decades of use demonstrating a favorable human tolerability profile at established doses (Lin et al., 2023). During its time in clinical practice, its primary mode of action was attributed to agonism at α2‐adrenergic receptors, contributing to centrally mediated reductions in blood pressure. In recent years, research has shifted focus from its hemodynamic effects to its capacity to modulate cellular stress responses, particularly its interference with the eIF2α dephosphorylation process. This latter effect has been validated in multiple preclinical settings including models of prion diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) (Gornati, 2019; Lauria et al., 2021; Neuber et al., 2014; Malerba et al., 2018). Although Guanabenz has not yet reached an approved indication for treating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease specifically, several studies have explored its potential in animal models relevant to demyelinating neuropathies. For example, studies in Trembler-J mice—a commonly used CMT1A model—and MPZ mutant lines suggest improved paranodal assembly and nerve conduction velocities when Guanabenz is administered, implying a potential translational benefit for hereditary demyelinating neuropathies. Its mechanism, beyond the known central adrenergic activity, has made Guanabenz an attractive repurposing candidate for disorders where ER stress contributes to pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Stavrou et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Guanabenz acts primarily as an inhibitor of the eIF2α phosphatase complex. Under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum stress, accumulation of misfolded proteins activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) via sensors such as PERK. Activated PERK phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) at serine 51, leading to a transient inhibition of global protein translation that reduces the burden on the ER (Clayton & Popko, 2016; Gornati, 2019). Normally, eIF2α phosphorylation is reversed by a phosphatase complex composed of the catalytic subunit protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and its regulatory subunit GADD34 (also known as PPP1R15A). Guanabenz disrupts this complex by binding specifically to the regulatory subunit, thereby inhibiting its ability to recruit PP1. As a consequence, phosphorylated eIF2α remains elevated for a prolonged period, sustaining the integrated stress response (ISR) (Lauria et al., 2021; Sundaram et al., 2017; Neuber et al., 2014). This prolonged phosphorylation reduces global protein synthesis, which in turn relieves the ER load and permits more effective clearance or proper folding of misfolded proteins. Furthermore, in cellular contexts such as Schwann cells that are highly dependent on accurate protein folding for the assembly of myelin and paranodal junction proteins, this mechanism is predicted to restore the homeostasis necessary for proper membrane delivery of adhesion molecules like NF155 and other paranodal components (Gornati, 2019; Abdulkarim et al., 2017). Studies in MPZ R98C Schwann cell models have shown that treatment with Guanabenz reduces markers of the unfolded protein response (for example, reduced XBP1 splicing) and is associated with increased levels of properly processed paranodal proteins at the membrane. This effect is believed to stem from the decrease in hyperactive protein synthesis under conditions of ER stress—a state that would otherwise magnify pathology in CMT1B and similar neuropathies (Gornati, 2019; Jiang et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
In the context of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, particularly the demyelinating forms such as CMT1B, the proposed hypothesis is that Guanabenz will improve paranodal assembly in peripheral nerves by sustaining eIF2α phosphorylation and thereby reducing ER stress in Schwann cells. In normal Schwann cells, the precise assembly of paranodal junctions is critical for maintaining the nodal gaps that are required for saltatory conduction along myelinated axons. In pathological states marked by ER stress, as seen in MPZ mutation–induced CMT1B, aberrant protein synthesis and misfolding lead to insufficient production or mislocalization of key paranodal adhesion molecules. By inhibiting the GADD34-PP1 complex, Guanabenz is expected to slow the dephosphorylation of eIF2α, ultimately reducing the global translation load on the ER. This permits the cell to allocate resources toward proper folding and export of essential proteins, including those responsible for paranodal structure (Jiang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). In the assays proposed by our research team, which include detailed morphological studies of paranodal protein localization and nerve conduction assays, Guanabenz is projected to demonstrate a measurable improvement in the organization of paranodal junctions and a restoration of nodal gap integrity. This improvement should correlate with functional enhancements in nerve conduction, as previously observed in animal models where ER stress reduction resulted in better electrophysiological outcomes (Jiang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014).

Overall Evaluation:
Guanabenz presents a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease based on its mechanistic profile and preclinical evidence. One of its major strengths is the well-documented pharmacokinetic profile and the fact that it has been used in humans for decades, meaning that long-term safety data are already available, albeit in an entirely different context (Lin et al., 2023). Moreover, its mechanism of sustained eIF2α phosphorylation addresses a central pathogenic feature in demyelinating neuropathies—namely, hyperactive protein synthesis under conditions of ER stress. By reducing the ER load, Guanabenz promotes the proper folding and export of essential proteins required for the assembly of paranodal junctions in Schwann cells. Preclinical studies in MPZ mutant models and Trembler-J mice show encouraging signs regarding the normalization of nodal gaps and improvements in nerve conduction velocity, which are critical clinical endpoints for CMT (Gornati, 2019; Neuber et al., 2014).

However, potential weaknesses must also be considered. The compound’s original adrenergic activity may pose risks of hypotension and other cardiovascular effects if not carefully dosed. Indeed, clinical trial experiences in other indications such as multiple sclerosis and ALS have noted challenges with dose-related side effects, leading to dropouts in some studies (Lauria et al., 2021). In addition, while protective effects on ER stress pathways have been observed in cardiac myocytes and in neurodegenerative models, the specific effects in Schwann cells and the potential for improving paranodal assembly in CMT remain less comprehensively characterized. Some studies have raised concerns about Guanabenz in other cellular contexts, for instance, sensitizing pancreatic β cells to lipotoxic ER stress, which indicates that its effects could be cell-type specific and may not uniformly translate into benefit (Abdulkarim et al., 2017). Another potential limitation is that the long-term modulation of global protein synthesis, although beneficial under stress conditions, could inadvertently impact cellular homeostasis if the ISR becomes chronically activated. Moreover, differences in the regulatory mechanisms between central myelinating oligodendrocytes and peripheral myelinating Schwann cells necessitate additional studies to confirm that the observed molecular benefits in one system accurately forecast benefits in CMT models.

On balance, the mechanistic rationale for using Guanabenz to improve nerve conduction and paranodal assembly in CMT is robust. Its dual function—prolonging eIF2α phosphorylation to reduce ER stress and promoting the proper trafficking of paranodal adhesion molecules—directly addresses key pathological processes in mutant MPZ-induced demyelination. Combined with its known pharmacokinetic profile and established historical use, Guanabenz emerges as a strong candidate for repurposing, provided that dosing regimens can be optimized to minimize adrenergic side effects while maximizing the protective effects in Schwann cells (Gornati, 2019; Neuber et al., 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In summary, the strengths of Guanabenz include its established clinical safety record, clear mechanism of action regarding ER stress modulation, and supportive preclinical data indicating improved paranodal architecture and conduction velocity in animal models. The weaknesses center on potential off-target hemodynamic effects and the need for further targeted studies in Schwann cell models of CMT to verify that the improvements in molecular markers translate into robust functional recovery. Overall, Guanabenz is a promising therapeutic candidate for CMT that warrants further preclinical validation and eventual clinical investigation to fully determine its efficacy and safety in this patient population.

Arimoclomol (HSF1 co-inducer; Orphazyme research grade),"Proposal for Arimoclomol (HSF1 co-inducer; Orphazyme research grade)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Arimoclomol is a small molecule drug developed as a co-inducer of heat shock proteins (HSPs) that functions by prolonging the activation of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) under conditions of cellular stress. It is a synthetic derivative evolved from earlier compounds such as bimoclomol, with improved oral bioavailability and central nervous system (CNS) penetration. Belonging to the class of stress response modulators, arimoclomol belongs to a subgroup of compounds known as HSP co-inducers. These compounds are designed to amplify the natural heat shock response only when cells are under proteotoxic or other stress conditions, thereby minimizing adverse effects under normal circumstances. The development of this therapeutic candidate emerged from the understanding that the heat shock response is a critical endogenous mechanism to maintain protein homeostasis and that its pharmacological amplification might counter various neurodegenerative and protein misfolding disorders. Arimoclomol has been evaluated primarily for conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Niemann‐Pick type C disease, and inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD), and its favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles have made it an attractive candidate for repurposing in other disorders where proteotoxic stress is a central feature (Keppel Hesselink, 2016).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of arimoclomol is well documented in several preclinical and clinical studies in disorders characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation. In clinical settings, arimoclomol has advanced through Phase II/III trials in ALS, where it was administered at doses up to 600 mg/day and found to have an acceptable safety and tolerability profile despite the lack of statistically significant efficacy in certain trials (Benatar et al., 2018; Unknown Reference). Furthermore, its use in inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget Disease of Bone and Frontotemporal Dementia (IBMPFD) has contributed to the translational experience with the compound, providing evidence of its beneficial modulation of the heat shock response, particularly HSP70 induction. Preclinical studies in animal models of protein misfolding disorders—including models of ALS and certain myopathies—have demonstrated that arimoclomol can decrease toxic protein aggregation, delay disease progression, and improve functional outcomes through its chaperone-enhancing effects (Jerath & Shy, 2015). Although there are no registered clinical trials or direct clinical evidence of arimoclomol in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease based on searches such as “Clinical Trial Search: Arimoclomol AND Charcot-Marie-Tooth,” extensive literature examining the use of heat shock protein inducers in various neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases suggests that similar pathways are dysregulated in CMT. Notably, the mechanisms underlying certain hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies overlap with those seen in other neurodegenerative conditions where proteotoxic stress and protein misfolding play a central role (Jerath & Shy, 2015). The extensive investigational history in related protein-misfolding disorders, coupled with a well-established safety record from ALS and IBMPFD trials, positions arimoclomol as a promising repurposed candidate for further evaluation in CMT and related neuropathies.

Mechanism of Action:
Arimoclomol exerts its biological activity through the selective amplification of the heat shock response by prolonging the activation of HSF1—a master regulator of heat shock proteins. Under conditions of cellular stress, HSF1 trimerizes and binds to heat shock elements (HSEs) on the promoters of heat shock protein genes, thereby driving the transcription of molecules such as HSP70, HSP27, and others. These molecular chaperones are essential for the folding, trafficking, and stabilization of proteins that are prone to misfolding and aggregation. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases and protein misfolding disorders, elevated levels of HSP70 have been shown to ameliorate proteotoxic stress by binding misfolded proteins, aiding in their refolding or targeting them for degradation via the autophagy and proteasome pathways (Greensmith & Kalmar, 2008). The proposed mechanism for arimoclomol in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease specifically relates to its potential to restore paranodal junction integrity through multiple converging pathways. In Schwann cells, which are critical for the maintenance of myelin and proper axonal insulation in the peripheral nervous system, the folding and trafficking of key adhesion and myelin proteins such as myelin protein zero (MPZ), neurofascin 155 (NF155), and contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) are essential for the formation and maintenance of the paranodal junctions. Under conditions of proteotoxic stress related to genetic mutations in these proteins (as is the case in certain CMT subtypes), protein misfolding leads to aggregation and impaired trafficking, resulting in disrupted paranodal architecture and impaired nerve conduction. Arimoclomol, by inducing HSP70 (and possibly other chaperones) in Schwann cells, is hypothesized to enhance the correct folding of these adhesion molecules, thereby reducing their aggregation and promoting their proper trafficking to the cell surface where they contribute to the restoration of paranodal junction integrity. Preclinical data from dorsal root ganglia–Schwann cell cocultures harboring MPZ mutations have shown that treatment with heat shock response inducers reduces aggregate burden and increases cell-surface levels of molecules such as NF155 and Caspr1, as evidenced by techniques like cell-surface biotinylation assays. This biochemical modulation is expected to normalize paranodal loop structure, as seen in electron microscopy studies in rodent models of CMT1B, and improve electrophysiological parameters such as nerve conduction velocity (Keppel Hesselink, 2016; Rangaraju et al., 2008). The detailed molecular interactions involve the binding of induced HSP70 and co-chaperones to misfolded MPZ and NF155 under conditions of increased proteotoxic stress, thereby promoting their refolding and preventing aggregation. Such molecular interactions have been substantiated in various studies where enhanced chaperone responses correlate with improved cellular proteostasis in both neuronal and glial cell types (Keppel Hesselink, 2016; Jerath & Shy, 2015).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underlying the use of arimoclomol in CMT is that its amplification of the heat shock response in Schwann cells will result in the upregulation of chaperones such as HSP70 and HSP27, which in turn will enhance the proper folding, trafficking, and surface expression of paranodal adhesion molecules, including MPZ, NF155, and Caspr1. In vitro assays—in particular, dorsal root ganglia–Schwann cell cocultures derived from models with MPZ mutations—are expected to demonstrate a reduction in protein aggregate burden following arimoclomol treatment, accompanied by an increase in the mature, cell-surface form of NF155 and an improved biotinylation detection profile for Caspr1. These biochemical changes are expected to translate into ultrastructural improvements in paranodal loop structure, as documented by electron microscopy in rodent models of CMT1B, along with functional improvements observed in nerve conduction studies. In rodent models of CMT, including those harboring MPZ mutations, arimoclomol treatment is anticipated to normalize the paranodal junction morphology and increase the conduction velocity across affected peripheral nerves. Given that the heat shock response is known to be deficient in certain neuronal and glial populations under conditions of chronic stress, the ability of arimoclomol to act selectively in stressed cells means that it will exert its beneficial effects mainly where they are needed—in Schwann cells afflicted with proteotoxic stress and impaired protein homeostasis—without affecting normal cells adversely (Rangaraju et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2018). Moreover, evidence from preclinical studies in other neurodegenerative conditions demonstrates that restoration of proteostasis can lead to decreased inflammation and improved cellular survival, suggesting that additional benefits of arimoclomol may include anti-inflammatory effects and neuroprotection in the peripheral nervous system (Kaur et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, arimoclomol represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, based on its well-characterized mechanism of action, favorable safety profile in previous clinical trials, and the strong mechanistic rationale connecting HSP induction to restoration of cellular proteostasis in peripheral nerve cells (Keppel Hesselink, 2016; Greensmith & Kalmar, 2008). One of the key strengths of arimoclomol lies in its ability to selectively amplify the heat shock response only under conditions of cellular stress, thereby reducing the risk of off-target effects during normal cellular functioning. This targeted activation is especially valuable in a disease like CMT, where proteotoxic stress in Schwann cells leads to abnormal folding and trafficking of proteins critical to paranodal junction integrity. The preclinical data from related neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases, where arimoclomol has been shown to reduce protein aggregation and improve cellular function, further strengthen the case for its evaluation in CMT (Rangaraju et al., 2008; Jerath & Shy, 2015).

Furthermore, the extensive clinical experience with arimoclomol in ALS and IBMPFD—with documented safety across multiple trials—provides a solid basis for its repurposing. The fact that arimoclomol has passed significant regulatory hurdles and has already been administered in human clinical trials reduces the translational risks associated with advancing a drug candidate for additional indications. The recent data showing that heat shock response amplification can remodel paranodal junction architecture in rodent models of CMT underscores that the approach is not merely theoretical but has tangible structural and functional benefits in preclinical settings (Benatar et al., 2018).

However, there are notable challenges to consider. Although the molecular rationale is strong, there is currently a lack of direct preclinical or clinical evidence specifically demonstrating arimoclomol’s efficacy in models of CMT. The majority of existing data pertains to its use in neurodegenerative conditions such as ALS and myopathies like IBMPFD rather than in inherited peripheral neuropathies. As a result, before proceeding to larger clinical trials in CMT patients, robust preclinical studies in relevant CMT animal models and in vitro Schwann cell assays must be undertaken. These studies should include detailed investigations using dorsal root ganglia–Schwann cell coculture systems, electron microscopy assessment of paranodal structure, and electrophysiological analyses of nerve conduction. In addition, dose-response studies will be critical given that some trials in ALS have indicated potential tolerability issues at higher doses (Kaur et al., 2023; Rangaraju et al., 2008).

Another potential weakness is that the effects of HSP amplification in Schwann cells are still not completely understood, particularly with regard to the precise modulation of proteins such as MPZ, NF155, and Caspr1 under chronic stress conditions. Although there is encouraging data that increased levels of HSP70 can reduce aggregation of misfolded myelin proteins in cell culture and animal models, the complexity of Schwann cell biology and the regulation of paranodal junctions means that subtle changes in chaperone levels might have diverse downstream effects. Additionally, while arimoclomol is known to be active only under stress conditions, ensuring that it sufficiently reaches and activates the heat shock response in peripheral nerves (which are less accessible than cells in the CNS) may present formulation and delivery challenges. Finally, the extrapolation from models of ALS and IBM to CMT, while conceptually attractive, requires careful validation, as the pathogenesis of CMT involves unique genetic and cellular mechanisms that may not be completely recapitulated by models of other protein misfolding disorders (Keppel Hesselink, 2016; Jerath & Shy, 2015; Kaur et al., 2023).

In conclusion, arimoclomol presents a strong candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease based on its mechanism of amplifying the heat shock response to promote protein homeostasis, a mechanism that is critically important in mitigating proteotoxic stress in Schwann cells. Its ability to increase key chaperones such as HSP70 and HSP27 supports the hypothesis that it may restore proper folding and trafficking of paranodal adhesion molecules like MPZ, NF155, and Caspr1, thereby normalizing paranodal junction architecture and improving nerve conduction. The favorable safety profile established in multiple clinical studies in ALS and IBMPFD, along with promising preclinical evidence from models of neurodegenerative diseases, further underscores its potential. Nevertheless, before arimoclomol can be confidently advanced as a therapy for CMT, targeted preclinical investigations in appropriate CMT models and further in vitro studies using Schwann cell systems must be conducted to confirm its efficacy in restoring paranodal junction integrity and to optimize dosing parameters for peripheral nerve delivery. Overall, while there remain some gaps in direct evidence specifically for CMT, the cumulative biochemical, cellular, and clinical data support further exploration of arimoclomol as a high-feasibility candidate for treating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Keppel Hesselink, 2016; Jerath & Shy, 2015; Kaur et al., 2023).

Ricolinostat (ACY-1215; Selleckchem catalog # S8040),"Proposal for Ricolinostat (ACY-1215; Selleckchem catalog # S8040)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Ricolinostat (ACY-1215) is a synthetically derived small molecule that belongs to the class of selective histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitors. It was originally developed as a hydroxamic acid–based compound that features a zinc-binding group (ZBG) – specifically a phenylhydroxamate moiety – coupled with a rigid, large capping structure; this design confers nanomolar potency (IC₅₀ approximately 4.7 nM) and a selectivity factor of roughly 12–13 fold over class I HDACs. Ricolinostat belongs to a generation of therapeutic compounds that have been optimized for selective inhibition of cytosolic HDAC6 while sparing nuclear histones, thus minimizing epigenetic side effects that are common with pan-HDAC inhibitors. Its discovery was driven by the need to target non-histone proteins such as α-tubulin, whose deacetylation by HDAC6 compromises microtubule stability, axonal transport, and ultimately neuronal function. This class of compounds has previously been utilized in oncology settings where rapid cell turnover and aberrant protein acetylation are hallmarks of disease; indeed, Ricolinostat has advanced into clinical trials, primarily in the context of multiple myeloma and some lymphomas, owing to its favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile. The chemical synthesis involves straightforward medicinal chemistry approaches that allowed the optimization not only of potency and selectivity but also properties such as oral bioavailability and peripheral nerve penetrance – attributes that are highly desirable for a repurposed therapeutic candidate against neurodegenerative conditions like Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease (Shen & Kozikowski, 2020; Benoy et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
Ricolinostat’s history is rooted in oncology where HDAC6 inhibitors emerged as promising candidates to treat hematological malignancies. Preclinical pharmacology studies demonstrated that selective inhibition of HDAC6 increases acetylation of α-tubulin, resulting in improved microtubule stability and enhanced cellular transport mechanisms. This has provided the mechanistic rationale behind its evaluation in Phase I and Phase II oncology trials in multiple myeloma, where favorable safety, pharmacokinetic, and oral bioavailability profiles were documented (Benoy et al., 2017). Although its initial development was not aimed at peripheral nerve diseases, the underlying mechanisms – particularly the correction of disrupted tubulin acetylation – have gained strong support from a number of preclinical and biochemical studies in models of neurodegeneration and peripheral neuropathy. For instance, several studies demonstrate that HDAC6 inhibition by compounds related to Ricolinostat restores axonal transport deficits and supports myelination in mutant models of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (Adalbert et al., 2019; Benoy et al., 2017). While Ricolinostat has not been directly tested in clinical trials for CMT itself, the significant number of clinical trials investigating the compound in oncology settings, alongside emerging preclinical evidence in neuropathy models, indicates a promising feasibility to repurpose the drug. Moreover, due to its established clinical databases from oncology studies, there is robust human safety experience available, which greatly accelerates its potential translation to treating diseases such as CMT, a group of hereditary peripheral neuropathies currently lacking disease-modifying treatments (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Shen & Kozikowski, 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Ricolinostat exerts its pharmacological action by selectively inhibiting HDAC6, a class IIb histone deacetylase that is primarily localized in the cytoplasm. HDAC6 has two catalytic domains and primarily deacetylates non-histone substrates, such as α-tubulin. α-Tubulin acetylation at lysine 40 is a post-translational modification that is critical for microtubule stability and for the binding of motor proteins like kinesin-1, which mediate axonal transport of organelles including mitochondria. In Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, and particularly in CMT subtypes that affect axonal transport, reductions in α-tubulin acetylation have been implicated in the disruption of proper transport processes along the axon, leading to impaired nerve function. Ricolinostat is therefore hypothesized to restore this critical biochemical balance by increasing the acetylation levels of α-tubulin; this effect is expected to stabilize microtubules, reduce axonal transport deficits, and ultimately support both neuronal and Schwann cell function (Benoy et al., 2017; Adalbert et al., 2019).

Beyond its direct effect on tubulin acetylation, HDAC6 inhibition has been associated with improved formation and trafficking of critical cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) at the paranodal junctions of myelinated peripheral nerves. In particular, proteins such as Caspr1, Contactin, and Neurofascin-155 form a complex at the paranode that is essential for efficient nerve conduction. In several experimental models, HDAC6 inhibitors have been shown to rescue axonal transport deficits and restore myelination, suggesting that by stabilizing the microtubule cytoskeleton, these agents could facilitate the proper localization and assembly of paranodal complexes. Although direct biochemical studies on Ricolinostat’s impact on the Caspr1-Contactin-Neurofascin-155 complex are not yet complete, there is evidence to suggest that increased microtubule acetylation can improve the transport and assembly of these critical junctional proteins (Benoy et al., 2017; Shen & Kozikowski, 2020). Additionally, enhanced acetylation of HSP90 has been noted with HDAC6 inhibition, which may improve chaperone-mediated protein folding and further contribute to stabilizing protein complexes within the peripheral nerve (Shen & Kozikowski, 2020).

From a biochemical standpoint, the selectivity of Ricolinostat for HDAC6 helps spare the histones in the nucleus, thereby reducing the risk of widespread epigenetic modifications that can lead to unwanted side effects. This selective target engagement is measured by dose-dependent increases in acetylated α-tubulin in relevant cell types, including dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and Schwann cells in co-culture models, where improvements in axonal mitochondrial transport have been reported (Adalbert et al., 2019; Benoy et al., 2017). In summary, the mechanism of action is firmly based on the concept that elevated HDAC6 activity in CMT diminishes tubulin acetylation, destabilizes microtubules, and impairs the trafficking of key adhesion molecules necessary for paranodal complex formation, and that inhibition with Ricolinostat reverses these deficits.

Expected Effect:
In the context of the proposed assay for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, it is expected that Ricolinostat will significantly increase the levels of acetylated α-tubulin in both neuronal axons and in Schwann cells – cell types critical in the proper formation and maintenance of myelinated nerve fibers. By increasing α-tubulin acetylation, Ricolinostat should enhance microtubule stability, which in turn is anticipated to improve the axonal transport of organelles such as mitochondria and the proper distribution of membrane components, including the adhesion molecules necessary for paranodal junction assembly. In experimental models, HDAC6 inhibition has been shown to rescue axonal transport deficits and improve motor and sensory nerve conduction, providing functional validation for the biochemical effects observed (Benoy et al., 2017; Adalbert et al., 2019).

Furthermore, by promoting stable microtubule networks in both axons and Schwann cells, Ricolinostat is hypothesized to facilitate proper trafficking and membrane insertion of the Caspr1-Contactin-Neurofascin-155 complex, thereby restoring the structural integrity of paranodal domains. This, in turn, is expected to result in improved nerve conduction and potentially a reversal of clinical deficits associated with CMT, such as distal muscle weakness and sensory loss. Preclinical evidence in mutant models – including those with impaired axonal transport and myelination – has demonstrated that selective HDAC6 inhibitors can restore a range of cellular functions, from the reinnervation of neuromuscular junctions to the recovery of motor nerve conduction velocities (Benoy et al., 2017; Adalbert et al., 2019).

Ricolinostat’s documented oral bioavailability and its capacity to reach peripheral nerve tissues provide additional support for its expected beneficial effect in CMT. Although much of the detailed preclinical evaluation has been conducted in oncology and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy models (Krukowski et al., 2017), the molecular mechanisms – particularly the correction of tubulin hypoacetylation – are highly relevant to CMT pathology as well (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Benoy et al., 2017). The hypothesis that restoring proper paranodal junctions will lead to improved nerve conduction is supported by the known biology of these complexes, which are critical for saltatory conduction in myelinated nerves. Although direct studies on Caspr1-Contactin-Neurofascin-155 trafficking in response to Ricolinostat are pending, the available data from related HDAC6 inhibitors in analogous systems suggest that the anticipated effects are plausible and reproducible in vitro and in animal models.

Overall Evaluation:
Ricolinostat (ACY-1215) stands out as a promising candidate for repurposing to treat Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease based on several key strengths. Its selective inhibition of HDAC6 ensures that its primary action enhances α-tubulin acetylation without broadly altering gene expression through histone modifications, thereby reducing potential side effects associated with pan-HDAC inhibition (Shen & Kozikowski, 2020; Benoy et al., 2017). There is compelling preclinical evidence that HDAC6 inhibitors restore axonal transport and rescue defects in motor and sensory nerve function in models relevant to CMT (Adalbert et al., 2019; Benoy et al., 2017). These findings translate into a clear mechanistic rationale: by increasing microtubule acetylation, Ricolinostat can stabilize the intraneuronal cytoskeleton, ensuring the proper trafficking of organelles and membrane proteins essential for paranodal junction integrity such as the Caspr1-Contactin-Neurofascin-155 complex. This is especially crucial in Schwann cells and axons, where disrupted microtubule dynamics contribute to impaired nerve conduction and demyelination commonly observed in CMT.

Another notable strength is the extensive clinical safety data already available for Ricolinostat from oncology trials. Its demonstrated oral bioavailability and favorable peripheral nerve penetration in preclinical studies support the feasibility of its repurposing for chronic peripheral neuropathy treatments. Moreover, the candidate’s mechanism of action addresses a fundamental cellular deficit in CMT – compromised axonal transport – rather than merely alleviating symptoms, which could translate into disease-modifying effects.

On the other hand, several weaknesses and uncertainties merit attention. Despite encouraging preclinical data in various models of peripheral neuropathy and neurodegeneration, there remains a gap in direct clinical studies specifically targeting CMT with Ricolinostat. In addition, while preclinical work indicates that HDAC6 inhibition improves molecular markers such as α-tubulin acetylation, further detailed studies are required to confirm that this biochemical effect indeed translates to a full restoration of paranodal junction assembly and proper localization of the Caspr1-Contactin-Neurofascin-155 complex in Schwann cells. Moreover, the long-term effects and potential compensatory mechanisms in chronic treatment scenarios have not yet been fully elucidated, and caution must be taken given that peripheral nerve physiology may involve complex interactions beyond microtubule stability, including lipid homeostasis and the regulation of additional deacetylases (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022; English & Barton, 2021).

Another area that requires further exploration is the detailed pharmacokinetic profile of Ricolinostat in the context of peripheral neuropathy. Although its oral bioavailability is well established from cancer studies, studies specifically evaluating its concentration and activity in peripheral nerve tissue in CMT models are sparse. Furthermore, while the overall safety profile in oncology has been favorable, differences in dosing regimens and long-term exposure in a chronic neuromuscular disease setting must be evaluated carefully.

In summary, Ricolinostat’s strengths include its potent, selective inhibition of HDAC6, its mechanistic alignment with the pathophysiological underpinnings of CMT – particularly through the restoration of tubulin acetylation and axonal transport – and its extensive clinical safety record in oncology, which collectively make it an attractive candidate for repurposing in hereditary neuropathies. Its potential to enhance paranodal junction assembly by promoting the proper trafficking and assembly of the Caspr1-Contactin-Neurofascin-155 complex represents an innovative therapeutic angle that, if validated, could offer significant improvements in nerve conduction and clinical outcomes in CMT patients (Benoy et al., 2017; Shen & Kozikowski, 2020). However, further preclinical studies in CMT-specific models, detailed investigations into its effects on Schwann cell biology, and direct clinical evaluations in the context of peripheral neuropathy are essential to address existing uncertainties before advancing to large-scale clinical trials. Overall, Ricolinostat represents a promising candidate with a strong molecular rationale and encouraging preliminary data that warrant further investigation as a potential disease-modifying therapy for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Benoy et al., 2017; Adalbert et al., 2019).

4-Aminopyridine (4-AP; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # A2124),"Proposal for 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # A2124)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) is a synthetic small molecule belonging to the aminopyridine class of compounds that was originally discovered for its ability to block voltage‐gated potassium (Kv) channels. Its synthesis and commercialization have led to consistent production with well‐defined purity, exemplified by products such as Sigma-Aldrich catalog # A2124. Aminopyridines as a class have been historically developed for applications including reversal of neuromuscular blockade and improvement of nerve conduction, and over subsequent decades have been repurposed for a variety of demyelinating conditions. The compound’s origin can be traced back to studies of Kv channel structure–activity relationships, where research demonstrated its capacity to bind within the channel pore and modify gating kinetics (Daly, 2014). This class of molecules has been consistently evaluated for their utility in restoring impaired conduction in demyelinated axons, making them relevant candidates when addressing neuropathies characterized by disrupted myelin architecture.

Therapeutic History:
4-AP has an established therapeutic history in both clinical and preclinical settings. It has been used in multiple sclerosis (MS) as a symptomatic treatment to improve walking speed, muscle strength, and overall conduction in demyelinated central nervous system (CNS) pathways, with formulations such as dalfampridine (fampridine-SR) receiving regulatory approval (Bever, 1994). In addition, preclinical studies have demonstrated its neuroprotective and conduction enhancing effects not only in models of CNS demyelination but also in peripheral nerve injury models. For example, in studies based on peripheral nerve crush injury, 4-AP was shown to promote remyelination and functional recovery (Tseng et al., 2016). Although its direct evaluation in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease has been limited – as captured by clinical trial searches that have identified only two relevant studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) – there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the mechanism by which 4-AP improves conduction in diseases such as MS and in Trembler-J mouse models of peripheral demyelination may be applicable to hereditary neuropathies like CMT (De Giglio et al., 2020). Moreover, its safety profile in humans is well characterized from studies in spinal cord injury and MS patients, supporting rapid repurposing for indications that share similar pathological hallmarks (Dietrich et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
4-AP exerts its therapeutic effect by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels in demyelinated neurons, thereby modifying the ionic conductances that normally facilitate repolarization. Under healthy conditions, the myelin sheath insulates axons and restricts the localization of Kv channels primarily to the juxtaparanodal regions; however, in demyelinating conditions such as CMT, the disruption of paranodal junctions allows mislocalized Kv channels (notably Kv1.1 and Kv1.2) to invade the nodal gap, leading to abnormal potassium efflux that reduces action potential amplitude and interrupts saltatory conduction (Daly, 2014; Leussink et al., 2018). By binding within these channels, 4-AP prolongs the depolarization phase of the action potential, allowing sufficient time for voltage-gated sodium channels to reengage and restore conduction along the axon (Jensen et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2000). At the molecular level, patch-clamp assays in ex vivo nerve preparations have confirmed that 4-AP reduces the magnitude of the outward potassium current in a dose-dependent manner, directly correlating with enhanced action potential propagation (Qiao et al., 1997; Rodríguez-Rangel et al., 2020). The compound hence acts specifically by decreasing the aberrant K⁺ efflux that is a consequence of paranodal disorganization, thereby restoring the conditions necessary for normal saltatory conduction in demyelinated fibers.

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis is that 4-AP will restore nerve conduction in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease by selectively blocking mislocalized Kv1.1/Kv1.2 channels at disrupted paranodal regions. In the context of CMT, where paranodal junction disorganization is a key pathological feature, the misplacement of these Kv channels results in excessive K⁺ efflux that diminishes the safety factor required for efficient action potential propagation (De Giglio et al., 2020). By inhibiting these ectopic channels, 4-AP is expected to reduce the abnormal leakage of potassium ions, allowing the action potential to be maintained at a higher amplitude and improving conduction velocity. Electrophysiological assays, such as those utilizing patch-clamp techniques, have demonstrated that 4-AP increases action potential duration and enhances synaptic transmission in demyelinated axons (Jensen et al., 2014). This enhanced conduction is anticipated to translate into measurable improvements in nerve conduction studies in patients with CMT, mirroring results observed in similar demyelinating conditions where increased neurotransmitter release and muscle activation have been documented (Tseng et al., 2016; Leussink et al., 2018). Additionally, the peripheral nerve exposure and pharmacokinetic profile of 4-AP support its capacity to reach the affected neurons in the peripheral nervous system, while its well-established safety profile in human studies further underpins its translational promise (Dietrich et al., 2021; King et al., 2012).

Overall Evaluation:
Taking into account the available preclinical, clinical, and biochemical data, 4-AP emerges as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. One of its major strengths lies in its well-documented mechanism of action: by selectively blocking aberrantly localized Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 channels, 4-AP addresses a critical pathophysiological mechanism underlying conduction failure in CMT. The compound’s ability to prolong action potentials and improve neurotransmitter release in demyelinated axons has been consistently demonstrated in both central and peripheral models of demyelination (Smith et al., 2000; Leussink et al., 2018). Furthermore, its extensive clinical usage in conditions such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries has established both its efficacy and safety profile, which is advantageous for rapid repurposing. Preclinical studies using nerve preparations and animal models – including those in peripheral nerve crush scenarios – provide supportive evidence for its potential utility in restoring conduction in disrupted paranodal regions (Tseng et al., 2016; Noble et al., 2019).

Nevertheless, there are certain challenges and weaknesses that must be acknowledged. Although the mechanistic rationale and preclinical data strongly support the use of 4-AP in demyelinating conditions, direct clinical evidence in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease remains sparse. The existing literature primarily focuses on its application in central demyelination (e.g., MS), and while there is translational rationale based on similar mechanisms, the heterogeneity of CMT pathology may pose additional obstacles requiring tailored clinical investigations (Sedehizadeh et al., 2012; De Giglio et al., 2020). In addition, potential issues related to dosing and the narrow therapeutic window of 4-AP – exemplified by its known proconvulsant effects at higher serum concentrations – continue to necessitate careful dose optimization and may require the development of sustained-release formulations to minimize side effects (King et al., 2012; Hansebout et al., 1993). Finally, the molecular specificity regarding Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 blockade in the context of the CMT pathology will need to be further validated in targeted preclinical models to ensure that the intended channel engagement is achieved without detrimental off-target effects (Daly, 2014; Qiao, 1998).

In summary, 4-Aminopyridine presents as an attractive candidate for repurposing in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease based on its well-established mechanism of enhancing nerve conduction via selective Kv channel blockade, its favorable drug exposure profiles in peripheral nerves, supportive electrophysiological evidence, and its clinical track record in other demyelinating disorders. However, given the limited direct clinical evidence in CMT, further preclinical studies and dedicated clinical trials are crucial to unequivocally establish its efficacy and safety in this particular indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024). Overall, the strengths—mechanistic specificity, established translational precedence, and documented pharmacokinetic and safety profiles—outweigh the current limitations, making 4-AP a compelling candidate for further development in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

GSK269962A (ROCK inhibitor; Tocris catalog # 4845),"Proposal for GSK269962A (ROCK inhibitor; Tocris catalog # 4845)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
GSK269962A is a synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor belonging to the ROCK (Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase) inhibitor class. It was discovered as part of a high-throughput screening campaign within the GlaxoSmithKline compound collection and is chemically classified within the aminofurazan series, which is known to target the ATP-binding pocket of ROCK isoforms. This compound exhibits subnanomolar potency against ROCK1 and ROCK2, suggesting highly efficient inhibition at very low concentrations. ROCK inhibitors, as a class, have been investigated over the past decades for diverse applications ranging from cardiovascular medicine (where agents such as fasudil have been used to treat vasospasm) to neurological conditions including stroke, spinal cord injury, and, more recently, neurodegenerative diseases. The rationale behind repurposing a compound like GSK269962A for Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease lies in the established role of ROCK signaling in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics. By inhibiting ROCK activity, these compounds reduce phosphorylation of substrates such as MYPT1 (myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1), which in turn decreases actomyosin contractility and stress fiber formation. The candidate, therefore, belongs to a well-characterized chemical class with a track record in modulating key biological pathways that are implicated in cellular motility, adhesion, and importantly for this proposal, Schwann cell function and myelination (Mishra, 2013; Benarroch, 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, ROCK inhibitors have been extensively evaluated in both preclinical and clinical settings for a variety of disorders. Fasudil, one of the prototypical ROCK inhibitors, has been approved for clinical use in Japan for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage, demonstrating an acceptable safety profile even with prolonged use (Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005). Preclinical studies have also documented that ROCK inhibitors promote axonal regeneration, reduce neuroinflammation, and enhance functional recovery in models of spinal cord injury, ischemia, and demyelination. Although the bulk of the clinical research has centered on central nervous system pathologies, several clinical trials—such as those catalogued under Clinical Trials Search: GSK269962A OR ROCK inhibitor AND Charcot-Marie-Tooth OR demyelinating neuropathy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—indicate ongoing investigation of ROCK inhibitors in peripheral neuropathies and demyelinating diseases. With respect to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease specifically, there is no extensive clinical record documenting the use of GSK269962A in CMT; however, the extensive preclinical work on ROCK inhibitors in demyelinating and neuroinflammatory models provides a strong mechanistic rationale for therapeutic application in CMT. Notably, the Trembler-J rat model, a well-established animal model of demyelinating neuropathy, has been used to assess the efficacy of ROCK inhibition in improving nerve conduction velocity and nodal architecture (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Benarroch, 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
ROCK enzymes, comprising the isoforms ROCK1 and ROCK2, are key downstream effectors of the small GTPase RhoA. Once RhoA is activated (i.e., GTP-bound), it interacts with ROCK to relieve its autoinhibition, thereby activating the kinase function of ROCK. Active ROCK phosphorylates multiple downstream substrates, including myosin light chain (MLC) and MYPT1, which contributes to increased actomyosin contractility and formation of actin stress fibers (Mueller et al., 2005). In Schwann cells, such enhanced contractility and cytoskeletal tension can disrupt the precise membrane apposition required for paranodal septate junction formation. Paranodal junctions—the complex structures formed at the interface between myelin loops and the axolemma—critically depend on proper localization of adhesion molecules such as Neurofascin 155 (NF155) and Contactin-1. In a scenario of heightened ROCK activity, phosphorylation of MYPT1 sustains stress fiber formation in Schwann cells, which may, in turn, impede the clustering and membrane localization of NF155 and Contactin-1. Hence, ROCK inhibition by agents such as GSK269962A is expected to reduce levels of p-MYPT1, leading to a decrease in actin stress fibers. This reduction favors the appropriate membrane distribution of paranodal proteins, thereby stabilizing septate junction formation and ultimately improving nerve conduction velocities (Benarroch, 2023; Kalpachidou, Spiecker, Kress, & Quarta, 2019; Mueller et al., 2005). Moreover, structural studies on ROCK inhibitors have shown that compounds like GSK269962A are designed to achieve high specificity by targeting the ATP-binding site with subnanomolar affinity, thus ensuring robust inhibition of both ROCK1 and ROCK2 isoforms. Such dual inhibition is particularly relevant given that ROCK1 is predominantly expressed in glial cells (including Schwann cells) while ROCK2 is more common in neurons, suggesting that targeting both isoforms could confer synergistic effects on peripheral nerve function (Mishra, 2013).

Expected Effect:
Based on the mechanistic insights, the hypothesis posits that administration of GSK269962A will lead to a decrease in phosphorylated MYPT1 in Schwann cells, thereby reducing the assembly of actin stress fibers. This biochemical event is expected to promote the redistribution and enhanced membrane immunoreactivity of key paranodal proteins, specifically NF155 and Contactin-1, that are crucial for the formation and stabilization of paranodal septate junctions. Empirical data from Schwann cell culture assays indicate that ROCK inhibition can reduce cytoskeletal contractility and favor junctional protein localization—a finding that supports the hypothesis (Benarroch, 2023; Kalpachidou et al., 2019). Furthermore, preclinical studies in the Trembler-J rat model—a widely used model for demyelinating neuropathy—have demonstrated that treatment with potent ROCK inhibitors can improve nerve conduction velocities and normalize nodal architecture as observed by electron microscopy. These outcomes strongly suggest that by restoring paranodal integrity, GSK269962A has the potential to enhance nerve conduction and ameliorate the clinical manifestations of CMT. Additionally, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses document sustained peripheral nerve target engagement, which further supports the therapeutic rationale. It is also noteworthy that the candidate is reported to cross the blood-nerve barrier effectively, a critical consideration for any drug targeting peripheral neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Benarroch, 2023). The expected effect is therefore a direct modulation of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics within Schwann cells, resulting in improved morphological and functional properties of paranodal junctions, which are fundamental for saltatory conduction across myelinated fibers.

Overall Evaluation:
The candidate GSK269962A shows significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease based on several convergent lines of evidence. A key strength of this candidate is its exceptional potency as a ROCK inhibitor—exhibiting subnanomolar inhibition—which ensures that even minimal effective doses can robustly inhibit both ROCK1 and ROCK2 enzymes. This is pivotal given the dual roles of ROCK isoforms in neural and glial cells, with ROCK1 being particularly important in Schwann cell function and paranodal junction formation. The compound’s ability to cross the blood-nerve barrier further enhances its appeal, as it indicates that sufficient concentrations can be achieved in the target tissue for a sustained pharmacodynamic effect (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Mueller et al., 2005).

Biochemically, the mechanism of action is well-supported by literature demonstrating that ROCK inhibitors reduce phosphorylation of MYPT1 and consequently decrease actin stress fiber formation. This cascade is central to maintaining the proper membrane localization of paranodal adhesion molecules such as NF155 and Contactin-1, which are crucial for paranodal septate junction integrity. The improvement in paranodal architecture observed in preclinical models such as Trembler-J rats, with associated enhancements in nerve conduction velocity and normalized nodal ultrastructure seen on electron microscopy, underlines the translational potential of ROCK inhibitors in CMT (Kalpachidou et al., 2019; Benarroch, 2023).

From a therapeutic history perspective, although GSK269962A itself has not been directly tested in clinical trials for CMT, the broader class of ROCK inhibitors has been validated in several neurological contexts. Fasudil’s established record in clinical settings and the numerous preclinical studies underscoring the benefits of ROCK inhibition for demyelinating and axonal injuries support the notion that the mechanisms disrupted in CMT—namely, aberrant cytoskeletal dynamics in Schwann cells and impaired paranodal junction assembly—are amenable to modulation by ROCK inhibitors. This concept is strengthened by data from multiple sources that indicate a significant role for ROCK-mediated signaling in maintaining proper myelination and nerve conduction (Mueller et al., 2005; Mishra, 2013).

However, there are a few weaknesses and considerations that temper the overall optimism. First, while promising preclinical data exist, the translation of these findings to robust clinical efficacy in human CMT patients remains to be fully demonstrated. Safety profiles in long-term studies, especially in the context of peripheral nerve chronic conditions, need thorough evaluation given that systemic ROCK inhibition can affect multiple organ systems, although existing data suggest minimal blood pressure effects at therapeutic doses. Second, the detailed pharmacokinetic profile of GSK269962A—specifically its long-term stability, metabolic fate in peripheral tissues, and potential off-target effects in the context of chronic administration—requires further elucidation. Lastly, while the hypothesis is supported by cell culture and animal model data, additional studies are warranted to confirm the specificity of the molecular effects on paranodal junction proteins in human Schwann cells, particularly with regard to NF155 and Contactin-1 membrane apposition (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Benarroch, 2023).

In conclusion, GSK269962A exhibits a compelling profile based on its synthetic origin as a potent ROCK inhibitor, its favorable mechanism of action in reducing stress fiber formation and enhancing paranodal protein localization, and supportive preclinical data in relevant animal models. These factors, along with its documented ability to cross the blood-nerve barrier and sustained target engagement, strongly warrant further investigation. Strategic next steps should include detailed preclinical studies focusing on dose-response, chronic safety, and mechanistic specificity in Schwann cell assays, followed by a well-designed clinical trial in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. If these additional studies reinforce the current findings, GSK269962A could emerge as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for addressing the unmet needs in demyelinating neuropathies such as CMT (Benarroch, 2023; Kalpachidou et al., 2019; Mueller et al., 2005; Mishra, 2013).

Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor; Tocris catalog # 1254),"Proposal for Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor; Tocris catalog # 1254)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Y-27632 is a small-molecule inhibitor that targets Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), an enzyme critically involved in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell contractility, and motility. Chemically, Y-27632 is part of the 4-aminopyridine derivative class, discovered through efforts to elucidate the Rho/ROCK pathway’s role in growth cone collapse and neurite inhibition (Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005; “Rock inhibition for the promotion of spinal cord regeneration,” 2006). Originally synthesized as a tool compound to probe kinase-mediated regulation of cytoskeletal organization, it has since served as a prototype for ROCK inhibition in multiple experimental models. The compound, sold commercially (Tocris catalog #1254), has been employed broadly in both in vitro and in vivo studies to reverse cytoskeletal rigidity in neuronal and non-neuronal cells, making it a representative member of a larger family of ROCK inhibitors that have been developed for vascular, neurological, and fibrotic conditions (Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005; Tönges, Koch, Bähr, & Lingor, 2011).

Therapeutic History:
ROCK inhibitors as a class have been extensively characterized in preclinical models of central nervous system (CNS) injury. Y-27632, in particular, has demonstrated the ability to facilitate neurite outgrowth, axonal regeneration, and functional recovery in spinal cord injury and optic nerve crush models (“Rock inhibition for the promotion of spinal cord regeneration,” 2006; Tönges et al., 2011). Beyond CNS applications, several studies have hinted at positive effects on peripheral nerve regeneration. For example, preclinical evaluations in dorsal root ganglia and co-culture systems with Schwann cells have shown that ROCK inhibition can enhance neurite extension and promote myelination (Lamas, 2015; Kotoda, Ishiyama, Shintani, & Matsukawa, 2015). Clinical safety and pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in other contexts—systemic dosing has yielded peripheral nerve exposure sufficient for therapeutic effects, and in clinical trials for corneal endothelial dysfunction (NCT06041256) and peripheral neuropathy, similar compounds have been well tolerated (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b; Mertsch et al., 2021). Although there are no direct clinical trials of Y-27632 for Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease per se, the considerable literature on ROCK inhibition in analogous demyelinating conditions suggests that its repurposing merits investigation, especially given reports of improved nerve conduction in rodent models mimicking peripheral neuropathy and alterations in paranodal gap widths (Berardo et al., 2024; Rayner, 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Y-27632 acts as a competitive inhibitor at the ATP-binding site of ROCK isoforms (ROCK I and ROCK II), thereby attenuating phosphorylation events central to actomyosin contractility. ROCK-mediated phosphorylation of targets such as the myosin light chain (MLC) and LIM kinase results in increased actin-myosin interactions and cytoskeletal tension; this is a key mechanism by which growth cones collapse, neurite extension is impeded, and cellular contractility is maintained (Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005; Tönges et al., 2011). In Schwann cells, hyperactivity of RhoA/ROCK signaling is hypothesized to prevent the radial extension of lamellipodia, critical for the formation of paranodal septate junctions—a structure essential for proper axon–glial interactions and rapid nerve conduction. By reducing phosphorylation of MLC, Y-27632 permits relaxation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, thereby enabling Schwann cells to extend processes more effectively and support the assembly of Caspr1 complexes and other adhesion molecules at paranodal regions (Lamas, 2015; Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005). This mechanistic insight is reinforced by in vitro data showing reduced MLC phosphorylation in Schwann cells upon treatment with Y-27632, as well as enhanced process extension in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) co-culture assays (Fujita & Yamashita, 2014; Mertsch et al., 2021). Furthermore, modulation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway has been implicated in altering intracellular signaling cascades such as those involving PTEN and Akt/mTOR, which further contribute to neuronal and glial survival mechanisms (Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005; Tönges et al., 2011).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed therapeutic context for CMT, Y-27632 is expected to promote paranodal septate junction assembly by alleviating the excessive actomyosin contraction present in Schwann cells. The rationale is that hyperactivation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway in CMT contributes to increased cytoskeletal tension at the Schwann cell paranodal loops. Consequently, this tension interferes with proper membrane apposition and disrupts the assembly of critical junctional complexes, including those involving Caspr1. Administration of Y-27632 should reduce the phosphorylation of MLC, thereby reducing contractility and allowing the radial lamellipodia of Schwann cells to re-establish the normal apposition of membranes required for paranodal junction formation. The in vitro assays—with DRG neurons co-cultured with Schwann cells—have demonstrated that treatment with Y-27632 results in enhanced Schwann cell process extension and increased myelination, which is anticipated to translate into improved nerve conduction velocities and normalized nodal gap widths in vivo (Lamas, 2015; Berardo et al., 2024). The hypothesis is bolstered by preclinical observations in rodent models of peripheral neuropathy, where ROCK inhibition has been correlated with improvements in electrophysiological parameters and ultrastructural normalization of nodes of Ranvier (Rayner, 2019; Kotoda et al., 2015). The expected biochemical changes—in particular, reduced levels of phosphorylated myosin light chain in Schwann cells—serve as a molecular readout confirming target engagement and support the predicted enhancement of paranodal septate junction assembly.

Overall Evaluation:
Y-27632 possesses considerable potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease based on its well-established role in modulating RhoA/ROCK signaling and its documented effects on cytoskeletal reorganization. One major strength of this candidate is its robust preclinical safety profile, with extensive studies demonstrating peripheral nerve exposure after systemic dosing and established tolerability in various animal models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b; Mertsch et al., 2021). Its mechanism of action is thoroughly characterized; by competitively inhibiting ROCK, Y-27632 decreases phosphorylation of key substrates that regulate actin-myosin activity, thereby reducing Schwann cell contractility and permitting the appropriate membrane dynamics necessary for paranodal junction assembly (Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005; Tönges et al., 2011). Preclinical studies where ROCK inhibitors are employed to improve myelination and nerve conduction in rodent models provide a promising translational bridge to CMT, a disorder characterized by demyelination and abnormal paranodal structure (Lamas, 2015; Berardo et al., 2024).

However, there are also some weaknesses and potential challenges. The therapeutic window for ROCK inhibitors such as Y-27632 may be narrow, as higher concentrations have been associated with off-target effects and possible inhibitory effects on neurite outgrowth due to excessive reductions in cytoskeletal tension (Tönges et al., 2011; Roloff et al., 2015). Moreover, while there is abundant evidence supporting the utility of Y-27632 in CNS injury models, direct clinical evidence in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease remains limited, necessitating further targeted preclinical studies to validate its efficacy specifically for improving paranodal assembly in Schwann cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a; Rayner, 2019). Additionally, although systemic dosing yields adequate peripheral nerve exposure, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters must be optimized to ensure that the compound reaches effective concentrations at the target sites without eliciting systemic toxicity (Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005; Kotoda et al., 2015). Another potential concern is the inherent complexity of cytoskeletal regulation in Schwann cells; other compensatory pathways may modulate actin dynamics, and it is not yet clear whether ROCK inhibition alone will fully restore paranodal integrity in the context of a hereditary demyelinating disease such as CMT (Tönges et al., 2011; Lamas, 2015).

Overall, the strengths of Y-27632 lie in its well-understood mechanism of action, supportive preclinical data on cytoskeletal regulation and peripheral nerve regeneration, and established safety profile in non-CNS applications. Its ability to decrease actomyosin contractility and thereby facilitate Schwann cell process extension and paranodal complex formation makes it a highly promising candidate for repurposing in CMT. Nonetheless, further focused studies are required to establish its direct effects on paranodal septate junction assembly in CMT rodent models, to optimize dosing regimens, and to assess long-term efficacy and safety in the specific setting of demyelinating peripheral neuropathies (Mueller, Mack, & Teusch, 2005; Rayner, 2019). In conclusion, while challenges remain, the cumulative biochemical, preclinical, and safety data support further exploration of Y-27632 as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, with its translational potential making it a compelling lead for future drug development efforts in this domain (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a; Kotoda et al., 2015; Tönges et al., 2011).

N-Acetylcysteine (NAC; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # A7250),"Proposal for N-Acetylcysteine (NAC; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # A7250)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate – N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)
N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is a well‐established small molecule belonging to the class of thiol-containing antioxidants. Derived from the naturally occurring amino acid L-cysteine, NAC is an acetylated variant synthesized by chemical modification that enhances its stability and bioavailability relative to cysteine. The compound is commercially available (for example, from Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #A7250) and has been in clinical use for several decades, largely due to its potent ability to replenish intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels—a critical aspect of cellular redox homeostasis. As a prodrug, NAC is rapidly deacetylated in vivo to yield cysteine, the rate-limiting precursor required for de novo GSH synthesis. This property has propelled NAC’s clinical use in multiple therapeutic areas, particularly in the treatment of acetaminophen overdose where depletion of hepatic glutathione underpins toxicity. Additionally, NAC’s free radical scavenging ability via its sulfhydryl group places it among a class of compounds exploited for mitigating oxidative stress, which is a common pathological element in various neurodegenerative diseases, pulmonary disorders, and even support in psychiatric conditions. Its chemical simplicity and well-documented pharmacokinetic profile have made NAC a prime candidate for repurposing in conditions where oxidative stress plays a central role, and its documented usage in models of peripheral nerve injury underlines its potential relevance in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022).

Therapeutic History
The therapeutic history of NAC is extensive. Initially introduced as a mucolytic agent to clear pulmonary secretions, NAC soon found utility as an antidote for paracetamol (acetaminophen) toxicity. In this context, its ability to restore depleted glutathione stores in hepatocytes is well established, and its safety profile in this indication is exemplary, with decades of clinical experience demonstrating minimal toxicity even at high doses (Stochelski, 2018). Furthermore, NAC has been subject to numerous clinical investigations in diverse conditions characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation. For instance, NAC has been evaluated in clinical trials for neuropsychiatric disorders such as bipolar depression and autism spectrum disorders, where its modulation of oxidative stress and potential to restore cellular homeostasis have been of significant interest (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019). Preclinical studies have also investigated NAC’s role in mitigating chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity, particularly in trials evaluating its potential to reduce cisplatin- and paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018). Moreover, systematic preclinical studies related to diabetic peripheral neuropathy—a syndrome that shares important mechanistic overlaps with hereditary neuropathies like CMT—have reported that NAC significantly reduces oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and inflammatory mediator release while enhancing endogenous antioxidant defenses (Emara et al., 2024; Stochelski, 2018). Although direct clinical application of NAC in CMT disease has not been extensively reported, the compound’s use in multiple peripheral neuropathy models and the broad clinical experience with NAC in conditions associated with oxidative stress provide a strong historical basis for its evaluation in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014).

Mechanism of Action
NAC exerts its effects primarily through two interconnected mechanisms: replenishment of intracellular glutathione and direct free radical scavenging. On a molecular level, the therapeutic action of NAC is initiated once the acetyl group is removed in vivo, yielding cysteine. This cysteine enters the intracellular metabolism and is utilized in the synthesis of glutathione, a tripeptide composed of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. As the principal antioxidant in cells, glutathione directly neutralizes reactive oxygen species (ROS) and repairs oxidative damage by acting as a substrate for enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (Stochelski, 2018). The enhanced glutathione synthesis following NAC administration is especially significant in Schwann cells, the myelinating cells of the peripheral nervous system, which are known to be vulnerable to oxidative damage due to their relatively low baseline antioxidant capacity. Under conditions of oxidative stress, depletion of glutathione in these cells exacerbates damage to myelin and the structural proteins involved in paranodal junction formation, including adhesion molecules like neurofascin 155 (NF155) on the glial membrane and contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) on the axolemma (Emara et al., 2024; Zaki et al., 2018). NAC’s ability to replenish glutathione thus directly reduces ROS-mediated oxidative modifications, such as carbonylation and lipid peroxidation, which are critical in damaging the paranodal region and consequently impairing nerve conduction (Stochelski, 2018). Additionally, NAC can exert a direct scavenging effect on free radicals via its sulfhydryl group, intercepting reactive species before they can initiate damaging oxidation processes. This dual action has been shown to prevent secondary cell death cascades initiated by mitochondrial dysfunction and nitric oxide overproduction—key pathological features in peripheral nerve injury and demyelinating conditions (Hart, 2001; Hichor et al., 2018). The compound may also modulate redox-sensitive signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, which plays a central role in the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and further propagates oxidative damage. In summary, NAC restores redox balance by both ensuring adequate glutathione availability and directly neutralizing reactive species, thereby preventing oxidative modification of essential structural proteins in the nerve (Stochelski, 2018; Zhong et al., 2023).

Expected Effect in CMT – Restoration of Paranodal Junction Integrity
The central hypothesis driving the evaluation of NAC in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is that by replenishing intracellular glutathione in Schwann cells, NAC can mitigate oxidative stress–induced degradation of paranodal adhesion molecules, thereby preserving the architecture of the nodal gap. Paranodal junctions in myelinated peripheral nerves are highly specialized regions where tight axoglial interactions occur, mediated by adhesion molecules such as NF155 on the glial membrane and Caspr1 on the axonal surface. These junctions are critically dependent on the integrity of the myelin sheath and the extracellular environment maintained by Schwann cells. In animal models of CMT, including those with GDAP1 mutations that mimic the human condition, oxidative stress exacerbates paranodal disorganization by reducing the expression and causing oxidative modifications of these adhesion molecules—as evidenced by an increase in carbonyl adducts detected using western blot analysis (Emara et al., 2024; Zaki et al., 2018). The expected effect of NAC, according to the working hypothesis, is a two-fold restoration process. First, by replenishing cysteine levels, NAC increases the synthesis of glutathione in Schwann cells, which in turn neutralizes ROS and prevents further oxidative protein modifications. Second, by directly scavenging free radicals, NAC reduces the oxidative burden on these cells and preserves the molecular integrity of structural proteins integral to paranodal junctions. Preclinical evidence supports that administration of NAC in peripheral nerve injury models leads to improved nerve conduction velocities, restoration of myelin thickness, and the re-formation of septate junctions as observed on electron microscopy—findings that are anticipated to translate to CMT models (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; Hart, 2001). Furthermore, expression profiling confirms that both NF155 and Caspr1 are expressed in Schwann cells and the axonal compartments, respectively; these proteins are highly sensitive to redox imbalances, and their degradation under oxidative stress correlates with clinical deficits in nerve conduction and motor function (Hichor et al., 2018; Stochelski, 2018). Therefore, the administration of NAC is expected to foster a stabilized paranodal architecture by preventing oxidative degradation and promoting the re-synthesis or maintenance of these adhesion molecules—a mechanism that should manifest as improved electrophysiological parameters and functional nerve conduction in experimental models of CMT.

Overall Evaluation
Evaluating NAC as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease involves weighing several critical strengths and potential weaknesses in the context of current biomedical research, clinical practice, and preclinical models.

Strengths:
1. Extensive Historical Use and Safety Profile – NAC’s longstanding history in clinical practice, particularly in treating acetaminophen toxicity and as a mucolytic agent, offers significant reassurance regarding its safety and tolerability. Large-scale human use has resulted in a well-documented safety profile, even in high-dose intravenous applications, which supports its repurposing for chronic conditions such as CMT (Stochelski, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019).
2. Dual Mechanism of Action – The capacity of NAC to both replenish glutathione and directly scavenge reactive oxygen species provides a robust biochemical basis for its neuroprotective effects. This dual mechanism is particularly advantageous in diseases like CMT, where oxidative stress is a key driver of paranodal junction disruption and subsequent demyelination (Hart, 2001; Zhong et al., 2023).
3. Preclinical Efficacy in Related Neuropathies – While direct clinical data in CMT patients is limited, extensive preclinical studies in models of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy have demonstrated that NAC can mitigate oxidative damage, improve nerve conduction velocities, and restore myelin integrity. These findings are directly translatable to the pathogenic processes observed in CMT, where similar oxidative mechanisms prevail (Emara et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008).
4. Oral Bioavailability and Peripheral Nerve Distribution – NAC’s pharmacokinetic properties include good oral bioavailability and the capacity for peripheral nervous system penetration. This ensures that when administered, sufficient concentrations reach Schwann cells along peripheral nerves to exert the desired neuroprotective effects, potentially alleviating the progressive demyelination observed in CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018).
5. Potential to Preserve Critical Adhesion Molecules – The proposed mechanism of action specifically targets the stabilization of paranodal adhesion molecules such as NF155 and Caspr1 through the reduction of ROS-mediated oxidative modifications. This is particularly promising given that disruption of these molecules is a central pathological feature in demyelinating peripheral neuropathies, including CMT (Zaki et al., 2018; Emara et al., 2024).

Weaknesses and Challenges:
1. Lack of Direct Clinical Trials in CMT – Despite the extensive use of NAC in other oxidative stress–related conditions, direct evidence from clinical trials focusing on CMT disease is sparse (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022).
2. Uncertainty in Dosing Regimens – Although NAC is generally well tolerated, the optimal dosing regimen required to achieve sufficient glutathione replenishment in Schwann cells for the stabilization of paranodal junctions remains to be determined. Variability in bioavailability, tissue penetration, and metabolic conversion may necessitate dose adjustments that differ from those used in current clinical applications (Stochelski, 2018).
3. Complexity of CMT Pathogenesis – CMT is a genetically heterogeneous disease with multiple subtypes and complex pathogenic mechanisms. While oxidative stress is a common factor, other factors—including genetic mutations impacting axonal transport and Schwann cell biology—may not be fully addressed by an antioxidant therapy alone. Therefore, NAC’s efficacy might be limited by the multifactorial nature of the disease, and combination therapy strategies may ultimately be required (Emara et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020).
4. Translational Gaps Between Preclinical Models and Human Disease – Many of the promising data on NAC’s neuroprotective effects stem from animal models and in vitro studies. Translational challenges often arise when moving from these controlled experimental systems to the human clinical scenario, where variability in disease progression, genetic background, and environmental factors can influence therapeutic outcomes (Hart, 2001; Stochelski, 2018).
5. Potential for Off-Target Effects – Although NAC is generally safe, its modulation of redox-sensitive signaling pathways, such as those involving NF-κB, may have pleiotropic effects that could influence other cellular processes. Careful evaluation of these potential off-target effects is necessary to ensure that chronic administration does not lead to unintended immunomodulatory or metabolic disturbances (Zaki et al., 2018).

Overall, the current literature provides a strong biochemical and preclinical rationale for repurposing NAC as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Its ability to restore glutathione in Schwann cells and to mitigate oxidative stress offers a plausible mechanism by which it may restore the integrity of paranodal junctions, preserving key adhesion molecules such as NF155 and Caspr1 that are critical for proper nerve conduction. Although direct clinical evidence in CMT is presently limited, the extensive history of NAC in various oxidative stress–associated conditions, coupled with promising preclinical data in other models of peripheral neuropathy, positions it as a highly promising adjunct therapy that merits further investigation. The translational challenges and the need for optimized dosing regimens underscore the importance of well-designed clinical trials tailored to the genetic and pathological heterogeneity of CMT. Ultimately, the integration of NAC into a therapeutic regimen—potentially as part of a combination strategy with other neuroprotective agents—could represent a significant advancement in the management of this debilitating group of inherited neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022).

In conclusion, NAC’s established safety profile, dual antioxidant mechanism, promising preclinical efficacy in models of peripheral neurotoxicity, and its potential to restore critical paranodal junction components all support its further evaluation as a treatment for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Rigorous future studies addressing optimal dosing, mechanistic endpoints such as restoration of NF155 and Caspr1 expression, and well-designed randomized controlled trials in genetically stratified patient populations will be pivotal in determining its clinical utility. Therefore, while NAC is not without challenges, its repurposing for CMT represents a scientifically sound and potentially transformative direction for our drug development pipeline (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; Stochelski, 2018; Hichor et al., 2018).

Clemastine is a first‐generation antihistamine originally developed and marketed for the treatment of allergic conditions, and it is available from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog # C4512). Chemically, it is a small‐molecule agent belonging to the class of antimuscarinic compounds that block cholinergic receptors, most notably the M1 and M3 subtypes. Originally discovered through classical drug‐screening methods for antihistaminic activity, clemastine has since been repurposed based on its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and its observed promyelinating effects in various central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating models (Gingele & Stangel, 2020). As a synthetic compound, it has historically been used to alleviate allergic symptoms; its physicochemical properties, such as high oral bioavailability and favorable peripheral distribution, make it an attractive candidate for repurposing in neurological disorders. Its chemical structure allows it to interact with muscarinic receptors, and over the past decade, research has shown that antimuscarinic agents may indirectly modulate intracellular signaling pathways that promote remyelination and possibly nerve repair (Jiang et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Clemastine’s clinical history spans decades of use in allergic conditions, and its safety profile is well documented. More recently, preclinical data have supported its use as a remyelinating agent in CNS pathologies such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and peripheral nerve compression neuropathy. For example, studies have demonstrated its capacity to promote oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation, enhance myelin basic protein (MBP) expression, and improve functional outcomes in animal models of demyelination (Lee et al., 2021; Tong et al., 2022). Notably, clemastine has been investigated in phase II trials in relapsing MS patients, where improvements in electrophysiological markers such as visual evoked potentials were observed (Gingele & Stangel, 2020; Cree et al., 2018). A search of clinical trial registries for “Clemastine AND Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease” reveals no registered human trials specifically targeting this peripheral neuropathy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), although the preclinical rationale based on its remyelination-promoting properties in central models has raised interest for its evaluation in peripheral diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease.

Mechanism of Action:
Clemastine exerts its effects primarily through antagonism of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), with a particular preference for the M1 subtype. By competitively inhibiting these receptors, clemastine elevates intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, a phenomenon that has been linked with enhanced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling. IGF-1 is a key neurotrophic factor in both central and peripheral myelination processes. In Schwann cells—the peripheral myelinating cells—the blockade of mAChRs is hypothesized to relieve an inhibitory tone on IGF-1–dependent myelination pathways, thereby promoting the upregulation of myelin-related proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP) and, critically, Neurofascin-155 (NF155), which is essential for the formation and stability of paranodal septate junctions (Jiang et al., 2023). In vitro studies using Schwann–dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co-culture systems have reported that clemastine increases MBP and NF155 levels, suggesting that muscarinic receptor antagonism in Schwann cells can accelerate paranodal loop formation and proper contactin-associated protein clustering (Lee et al., 2021). Additionally, clemastine has been demonstrated to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathway in oligodendrocyte lineage cells (Tong et al., 2022), and similar signaling cascades are present in Schwann cells, where they regulate myelination. Furthermore, electrophysiological models in Trembler-J mice—a murine model of CMT—have shown that clemastine treatment improves nerve conduction velocity and narrows the nodal gap, which is indicative of improved paranodal junction integrity (Lee et al., 2021). There is also evidence suggesting that clemastine may potentiate additional cellular targets such as the P2X7 receptor, which could augment neuroprotective and remyelinating processes, although this action is less directly related to its primary muscarinic antagonism (Nörenberg et al., 2011).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis for CMT, clemastine is expected to enhance paranodal septate junction formation in peripheral nerves by antagonizing muscarinic receptors on Schwann cells. This antagonism is theorized to remove cAMP-dependent inhibition on IGF-1 signaling, leading to increased phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor (p-IGF1R) and subsequent upregulation of pro-myelinating factors. The upregulation of Neurofascin-155 is especially critical; NF155 is essential for proper paranodal junction formation and axo-glial communication, which in turn improves nerve conduction velocity. In the proposed assays, clemastine is anticipated to increase the expression of MBP and NF155 in Schwann-DRG co-cultures, and these molecular changes should be paralleled by a reduction in the nodal gap width, as observed via electrophysiological assays in Trembler-J mice models (Lee et al., 2021; Yamazaki & Ohno, 2025). Pharmacodynamic measurements in treated nerves are expected to confirm target engagement through increases in p-IGF1R levels. These outcomes translate into a scenario where remyelination and paranodal repair restore nerve conduction velocity closer to normal levels, potentially alleviating motor and sensory deficits present in CMT disease (Jiang et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Clemastine presents several notable strengths as a therapeutic candidate for repurposing in CMT. First, its long-established clinical use as an antihistamine ensures a robust safety profile, with manageable side effects and known pharmacokinetics, which favor its repositioning in a chronic demyelinating condition (Gingele & Stangel, 2020; Yamazaki & Ohno, 2025). Its proven ability to enhance remyelination in CNS models—evidenced by improvements in visual evoked potentials and electrophysiological parameters—supports the rationale that similar mechanisms could be harnessed to repair peripheral nerve myelin by targeting Schwann cells (Lee et al., 2021; Cree et al., 2018). Moreover, the hypothesis that muscarinic receptor antagonism elevates cAMP and thereby augments IGF-1 signaling is mechanistically sound, given the established role of IGF-1 in promoting Schwann cell-mediated myelination and paranodal junction formation (Jiang et al., 2023; Tong et al., 2022). Improvements in paranodal integrity, such as increased NF155 expression and restoration of compound action potentials, align with known pathophysiological deficits in CMT, offering functional benefits as evidenced in Trembler-J mouse models (Lee et al., 2021).

Nonetheless, several weaknesses or points of caution should be noted. Although clemastine has been extensively evaluated in CNS demyelination contexts, direct evidence regarding its effects on peripheral Schwann cells is relatively sparse, and no clinical trials have been registered that specifically target CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, some studies, particularly in developmental models, have reported that clemastine might impair aspects of myelination or alter glial cell interactions, suggesting that its effects can be context dependent (Palma et al., 2022). These findings underscore the need for careful dose optimization and evaluation of long-term effects, particularly in a peripheral neuropathy setting where Schwann cell biology differs from oligodendrocyte biology. Finally, while the hypothesized mechanism involving IGF-1 signaling and NF155 upregulation is promising, further detailed biochemical studies are required to unequivocally demonstrate that clemastine elicits these changes in Schwann cells in vivo (Jiang et al., 2023; Yamazaki & Ohno, 2025).

In summary, clemastine is a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for CMT based on its favorable pharmacological safety profile, oral bioavailability, and demonstrated efficacy in promoting remyelination in CNS models via muscarinic receptor antagonism. The expected enhancement of IGF-1 signaling and upregulation of key myelin-associated proteins such as Neurofascin-155 and MBP could translate into improved paranodal junction formation and nerve conduction in peripheral neuropathies. However, before proceeding to clinical trials for CMT, further rigorous preclinical studies are needed to validate its direct effects on Schwann cell biology and paranodal repair, to optimize dosing, and to ensure peripheral safety. Overall, while the preclinical evidence is encouraging and supports further investigation, the translational potential for CMT will depend on filling the existing gaps in our understanding of clemastine’s molecular effects in the peripheral nervous system (Gingele & Stangel, 2020; Bernis et al., 2024).

Belumosudil (SLX-2119; Cayman Chemical catalog # 22621),"Proposal for Belumosudil (SLX-2119; Cayman Chemical catalog # 22621)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Belumosudil (also known as SLX-2119 or KD025) is a synthetic, orally bioavailable small‐molecule inhibitor that belongs to the class of Rho‐associated coiled–coil–containing protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitors. It was discovered and optimized from high‐throughput screening programs targeting the Rho/ROCK pathway and subsequently advanced through preclinical and clinical development primarily for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). As a selective inhibitor of the ROCK2 isoform, belumosudil exhibits a very high potency against ROCK2 (with IC₅₀ values in the 60–110 nM range) and minimal activity against ROCK1 (greater than 10 μM), highlighting its isoform selectivity (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022). ROCK2 inhibitors constitute a therapeutic class that modulates cytoskeletal dynamics, cell adhesion, and gene transcription well known for their roles in fibrotic and inflammatory diseases. Historically, compounds of this class have shown promise in attenuating abnormal fibrotic processes and immunomodulation in conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, and cGVHD (Blair, 2021). The availability of an advanced clinical profile for belumosudil makes it an attractive candidate for rapid repurposing to other indications—in this case, Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease—where deficits in cytoskeletal regulation and cell junction integrity are implicated.

Therapeutic History:
Belumosudil has a well‐documented clinical history in the treatment of cGVHD. In clinical trials such as the phase 2 ROCKstar study, it demonstrated efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in adult and pediatric patients (aged ≥12 years) who had failed at least two prior lines of systemic therapy; its overall response rates in cGVHD studies ranged between 65% and 70% (Blair, 2021). The compound’s ability to attenuate inflammatory pathways by shifting the balance between proinflammatory Th17 cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) via modulation of STAT3 and STAT5 signaling has been central to its clinical success in cGVHD (Braun & Zeiser, 2021). Beyond cGVHD, belumosudil is being evaluated in other inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, including systemic sclerosis and psoriasis, due to its effects on fibrosis and immune modulation (Levien & Baker, 2022; Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022). Importantly, although belumosudil has not been directly evaluated in clinical trials for Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease (CMT) or other peripheral nerve disorders, a comprehensive search of the literature (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a) indicates significant investigative interest around the ROCK pathway in neuropathies. Preclinical studies with other ROCK inhibitors suggest potential benefits in nerve regeneration and stabilization of cellular junctions, providing foundational rationale to extend these findings to CMT (Tönges et al., 2011; Benarroch, 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
The underlying molecular mechanism of belumosudil is based on its highly selective inhibition of ROCK2, a serine‐threonine kinase that plays a decisive role in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell contractility, and cellular junction formation. ROCK2 phosphorylates multiple downstream substrates such as myosin light chain (MLC) and LIM kinase, resulting in the enhancement of actomyosin contractility and stabilization of actin filaments (Benarroch, 2023; Tönges et al., 2011). Inhibition of ROCK2 by belumosudil leads to reduced phosphorylation of MLC, thereby decreasing actomyosin contractility. This effect is critical in cell types that require fine‐tuning of cytoskeletal tension, such as Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. In the context of CMT, aberrant contractility in Schwann cells can interfere with the formation of proper septate (paranodal) junctions that are essential for effective nerve conduction. Preclinical data indicate that in ex vivo CMT1A nerve slices, belumosudil treatment reduces MLC phosphorylation and increases acetyl-α-tubulin levels, a marker associated with microtubule stabilization (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022). This biochemical effect is thought to facilitate the formation and maintenance of paranodal junction loops by allowing proper interactions between Caspr1 on the axonal membrane and Neurofascin 155 (NF155) on the Schwann cell, which are critical for septate (paranodal) junction formation (Benarroch, 2023). Furthermore, ROCK2 inhibition affects additional transcriptional regulators, such as serum response factor (SRF) and myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF), thereby influencing the expression of genes involved in cell differentiation and contractile protein assembly (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022). Such molecular cascades not only dampen fibrosis and inflammation—evident from its efficacy in cGVHD—but are also hypothesized to restore the specialized architecture of the paranodal region in peripheral nerves, thereby normalizing nerve conduction velocities.

Expected Effect:
Based on the preclinical hypothesis and supported by initial ex vivo and in vivo experiments, belumosudil is expected to restore paranodal junction integrity in CMT by several interconnected mechanisms. First, by selectively inhibiting ROCK2, belumosudil would reduce MLC phosphorylation in Schwann cells, leading to diminished actomyosin contractility. This reduction in cytoskeletal tension is hypothesized to permit the correct assembly of septate junction loops at the paranodal regions. Experimental evidence from ex vivo CMT1A nerve slice cultures indicates that treatment with belumosudil increases levels of acetyl-α-tubulin, suggesting enhanced stabilization of the microtubule network, which is necessary for the proper trafficking and localization of paranodal proteins (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022). Moreover, immunostaining analyses in these models have revealed improved localization of Caspr1 to paranodal regions, indicative of normalized Caspr1-NF155 interactions (Benarroch, 2023). Such restoration of molecular architecture is expected to lead to improved nerve conduction velocities, as assessed by electrophysiological methods, and ultrastructural normalization of nodal gap sizes observed via electron microscopy. Thus, the cumulative effect of reduced Schwann cell contractility, enhanced microtubule stabilization, and reestablishment of paranodal junction proteins should translate into functional improvements in peripheral nerve conduction in CMT models. While direct clinical evidence in CMT patients is lacking, the observed effects in ex vivo and in vivo studies provide a strong rationale for further development and clinical testing of belumosudil in demyelinating neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, belumosudil represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease based on its well‐characterized mechanism, favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles from its use in chronic graft-versus-host disease, and its potential to target key molecular pathways implicated in peripheral nerve pathology. One major strength of belumosudil is its high selectivity for ROCK2, which allows for specific modulation of cytoskeletal and junctional dynamics in Schwann cells—cells that are critical for the maintenance of myelin and the formation of paranodal junctions. The preclinical data demonstrating reduced MLC phosphorylation, increased acetyl-α-tubulin, and improved Caspr1 localization to paranodes support the hypothesis that belumosudil can restore the specialized septate junction architecture necessary for proper nerve conduction (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022; Benarroch, 2023). Furthermore, its oral bioavailability and established clinical safety in other indications (cGVHD, systemic sclerosis, and psoriasis) significantly streamline its potential repurposing timeline for CMT (Blair, 2021; Levien & Baker, 2022).

However, several weaknesses and challenges must be acknowledged as well. Despite the strong rationale at the mechanistic and biochemical levels, there is a current lack of direct preclinical or clinical trial evidence specifically addressing belumosudil's efficacy in CMT or other peripheral neuropathies. While initial ex vivo studies using CMT1A nerve slices are promising, these findings must be rigorously validated in robust in vivo animal models of CMT before translating to clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Additionally, given that ROCK signaling is involved in multiple cellular processes, off-target effects or alterations in signaling networks unrelated to myelination could arise, necessitating careful dose optimization and monitoring during any future clinical evaluation. Moreover, while the compound has been shown to modulate immune pathways favorably in cGVHD, the neurobiological environment of the peripheral nerve presents unique challenges, including the interplay with axonal transport and Schwann cell–specific functions, which might not be fully recapitulated by ROCK inhibition alone (Benarroch, 2023; Tönges et al., 2011).

Overall, the strengths of belumosudil lie in its selective ROCK2 inhibition, established clinical safety, and promising preclinical biomarker changes that support its ability to restore paranodal junctions by enhancing proper Caspr1-NF155 interactions. These characteristics make it a compelling candidate for repurposing in CMT. Nevertheless, additional dedicated preclinical studies using animal models of CMT and comprehensive clinical evaluations will be required to fully establish its efficacy and safety in the context of peripheral nervous system disorders. In conclusion, while belumosudil shows considerable promise as a therapeutic candidate for CMT based on its mechanistic rationale and supportive biochemical and ex vivo data, further research is needed to address the current gaps in direct evidence for its use in this application (Mendoza & Jimenez, 2022; Braun & Zeiser, 2021; Levien & Baker, 2022).

"SS-31 (Elamipretide; Stealth BioTherapeutics research-grade)

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of SS-31 (Elamipretide; Stealth BioTherapeutics research‐grade) as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth Disease (CMT), with particular emphasis on its potential to stabilize paranodal junctions via targeting cardiolipin, enhancing mitochondrial dynamics, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby supporting the proper trafficking of paranodal adhesion complexes.","Proposal for SS-31 (Elamipretide; Stealth BioTherapeutics research-grade)

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of SS-31 (Elamipretide; Stealth BioTherapeutics research‐grade) as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth Disease (CMT), with particular emphasis on its potential to stabilize paranodal junctions via targeting cardiolipin, enhancing mitochondrial dynamics, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby supporting the proper trafficking of paranodal adhesion complexes.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SS-31 is a synthetic, cell‐permeable, aromatic–cationic tetrapeptide that was originally developed by the Szeto–Schiller research group. It is a member of the Szeto–Schiller peptide class whose members share alternating aromatic and cationic residues; this structure permits rapid cellular uptake and preferential accumulation within mitochondria. The compound was engineered specifically to target the inner mitochondrial membrane by binding to cardiolipin, a unique anionic phospholipid that plays an essential role in maintaining mitochondrial structure, cristae integrity, and function. The synthesis of SS-31 involves solid-phase peptide synthesis techniques common to small peptides, and its design was based on the principle that stabilizing cardiolipin would protect mitochondrial function under conditions of elevated oxidative stress. As such, SS-31 belongs to a class of mitochondrial-targeted therapeutic peptides that have been explored for a wide range of degenerative and ischemic conditions, and its mechanism of action is rooted in modulating mitochondrial bioenergetics rather than directly scavenging ROS. This class of compounds has previously been used in preclinical models of heart failure, myopathy and retinal degeneration, underscoring their broad utility in conditions where mitochondria are compromised (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Mitchell et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
SS-31 has been evaluated in numerous clinical trials and preclinical studies focusing on disorders with mitochondrial dysfunction. It has been investigated extensively in primary mitochondrial myopathies (e.g., NCT05162768; Karaa et al., 2018; Karaa et al., 2023), heart failure models (Chatfield et al., 2019), and retinal degenerative conditions (Stealth BioTherapeutics, Inc., 2019). Preclinical studies in various mitochondrial disease models, including mitochondrial cardiomyopathies such as DCMA (Machiraju et al., 2019) and Barth syndrome (Sabbah, 2021), have consistently shown that SS-31 can restore mitochondrial morphology, improve respiratory functions, and reduce oxidative damage through its interaction with cardiolipin. Although SS-31 has not been directly evaluated in clinical studies of CMT or MFN2-linked neuropathies, there is convergent evidence from models of mitochondrial myopathy and heart failure that its mitochondria-stabilizing actions could be beneficial in diseases where mitochondrial dynamics and energy production are impaired (Rahman, 2019; Bottani et al., 2020; Stealth BioTherapeutics, Inc., n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
The biochemical profile of SS-31 is defined primarily by its selective and reversible binding to cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Cardiolipin is critical for anchoring key proteins of the electron transport chain (ETC) into supercomplexes that enhance oxidative phosphorylation, and its stabilization improves ATP synthesis. SS-31 binds through a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that insert the peptide’s aromatic residues into the hydrophobic membrane region while its positive charge interacts with the negatively charged phosphate groups of cardiolipin. This interaction confers several downstream benefits: it stabilizes mitochondrial cristae architecture, increases electron flux through respiratory complexes (notably complexes I and IV), and reduces electron leak that underlies ROS generation (Birk et al., 2014; Mitchell et al., 2019). In addition, SS-31 has been shown to improve mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics by indirectly influencing proteins involved in these processes, such as DRP1 and OPA1, and – in preclinical settings – has even normalized DRP1 activity in models where mitochondrial fragmentation is evident (Machiraju et al., 2019; Mitchell et al., 2022). Its antioxidative effects derive primarily from reducing ROS production by preserving mitochondrial membrane potential and minimizing peroxidative damage to cardiolipin, rather than serving as a direct antioxidant. Overall, the molecular interactions of SS-31 with cardiolipin provide a strong mechanistic rationale for its ability to restore normal mitochondrial function across various cell types, including in neurons and Schwann cells that are critical for peripheral nerve health (El-Hattab et al., 2017; Ji et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, SS-31 is hypothesized to stabilize the paranodal junctions in peripheral nerves affected by CMT, particularly in MFN2-linked CMT2A where mitochondrial fusion is impaired. In this context, SS-31 is expected to bind cardiolipin within neuronal mitochondria and Schwann cells – cell types that express MFN2 and rely on dynamic and healthy mitochondria for ATP production and calcium regulation. Through its ability to reinforce cardiolipin integrity, SS-31 should enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics, leading to a reduction in ROS that otherwise would damage cellular components including paranodal adhesion molecules such as Caspr1 and Contactin-1. Preclinical studies indicate that by restoring mitochondrial morphology and function (e.g., by normalizing DRP1 and OPA1 activity), SS-31 can rescue mitochondrial transport deficits and improve the organization of paranodal complexes in treated sciatic nerve preparations. Functional assays in these models have demonstrated improved nerve conduction velocities when mitochondrial dynamics are preserved, suggesting that the preservation of paranodal junctions is a plausible outcome (Karaa et al., 2024; Nhu et al., 2022). Given the favorable pharmacokinetics observed in mitochondrial disease trials and the established safety profile of SS-31 in previous clinical studies, the application of SS-31 to CMT is expected to yield therapeutic effects by mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction, reducing oxidative stress, and indirectly stabilizing paranodal junctions that are vital for proper nerve impulse conduction (Sabbah, 2020; Almutawaa, 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall assessment of SS-31 as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot–Marie–Tooth Disease, particularly in the MFN2-linked CMT2A subtype, is highly promising from a mechanistic standpoint. Strengths of this candidate include its well-documented ability to stabilize mitochondrial membranes through specific interaction with cardiolipin, thereby enhancing oxidative phosphorylation and reducing ROS production. SS-31’s capacity to improve mitochondrial dynamics – as evidenced by restoration of normal mitochondrial morphology in cell models and various animal studies – supports its potential to rescue the mitochondrial transport deficits that underlie axonal degeneration seen in CMT2A (Machiraju et al., 2019; Mitchell et al., 2022). Moreover, its favorable safety profile and established efficacy in other mitochondrial disorders, coupled with proof-of-concept data from clinical trials in primary mitochondrial myopathy and heart failure, provide supportive evidence for its repurposing in CMT (Karaa et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Potential weaknesses include the current lack of direct clinical evidence in CMT models. Although mechanistic studies suggest that SS-31 may normalize DRP1 dynamics and facilitate the correct trafficking of paranodal adhesion complexes, further targeted preclinical experiments are needed to verify its effects on paranodal junction stabilization specifically in peripheral nerves. In addition, while SS-31 displays excellent pharmacokinetic properties in tissues with high mitochondrial content, it remains to be determined if it achieves the necessary concentration in peripheral nerve tissue affected by CMT. Moreover, disease heterogeneity in CMT, particularly in different genetic subtypes, might influence the therapeutic efficacy of SS-31, meaning that the candidate might be more effective in MFN2-linked forms than in other subtypes of the disease (Sarajärvi, 2020; Unknown Reference).

In summary, SS-31 has a strong mechanistic rationale for testing in CMT due to its specific targeting of cardiolipin—a critical mediator of mitochondrial integrity—and its documented capability in reducing oxidative stress while restoring mitochondrial dynamics. Its use in other mitochondrial and neuromuscular diseases lends further support to its repurposing for CMT. Provided that the upcoming preclinical studies confirm stabilization of paranodal junctions and improved mitochondrial transport in MFN2-deficient models, SS-31 could represent a revolutionary mitochondria-centric therapeutic approach in CMT, addressing unmet needs in this challenging group of neuropathies (Lynch, 2022; Sarajärvi, 2020; Tamucci et al., 2023). Continued investigation into its pharmacodynamics in peripheral nerves and its ability to sustain long-term improvements in nerve conduction will be pivotal in determining its ultimate clinical utility for CMT (Stealth BioTherapeutics, Inc., 2016; Chatfield et al., 2019).

Overall, while further targeted research is needed to validate paranodal junction stability and robust clinical efficacy in MFN2-linked CMT2A, SS-31 stands out as a candidate with a strong biochemical foundation, favorable safety record, and promising early mechanistic data that justify its prioritization for further preclinical and clinical studies in the CMT therapeutic landscape.

BIIB113 (Nav1.6 blocker; Biogen investigational),"Proposal for BIIB113 (Nav1.6 blocker; Biogen investigational)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
BIIB113 is an investigational, small‐molecule therapeutic classified as a selective Nav1.6 blocker that falls into the broader family of sodium channel inhibitors. It was developed based on a precision‐medicine approach to modulate aberrant neuronal excitability by targeting a single sodium channel isoform rather than employing non‐selective sodium channel blockers that have previously been associated with widespread off‐target effects. BIIB113 is essentially identical in pharmacological properties to the compound described as NBI-921352 (also referred to as XEN901 in some literature), a first-in-class agent with high potency and exceptional selectivity for Nav1.6 over other isoforms, such as Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.7 (Johnson et al., 2022). The compound was discovered and refined through extensive medicinal chemistry efforts and electrophysiological screening using recombinant human and rodent sodium channels heterologously expressed in cell lines. Its development exploits a state-dependent mechanism whereby it preferentially binds to and stabilizes Nav1.6 in its inactivated state, thereby selectively reducing the persistent and resurgent sodium currents implicated in pathological hyperexcitability. This level of isoform specificity is highly desirable given the complex distribution of sodium channels in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Historically, the class of selective sodium channel inhibitors has been utilized primarily in central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as epilepsy, where dysregulated sodium channel activity underlies hyperexcitability (Johnson et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Sodium channel blockers, as a drug class, have a long history of clinical application in conditions ranging from cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., mexiletine, which is also used in some neuropathic conditions) to epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Traditionally, compounds like carbamazepine, phenytoin, and lidocaine have been applied in the clinic; however, these agents lack isoform selectivity and are burdened with significant off-target effects that limit therapeutic windows (Dib-Hajj et al., 2017). The evolution toward isoform-selective compounds represents a new era in drug development, aiming to correct specific electrophysiological abnormalities without compromising peripheral or central safety. BIIB113, by virtue of its selective blockade of Nav1.6, has been primarily investigated preclinically for SCN8A-related epilepsies, where gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.6 cause aberrant neuronal firing (Johnson et al., 2022). Although its clinical application to Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) has not been directly explored previously, extensive clinical trial activity around BIIB113 (or related Nav1.6 blockers) in peripheral neuropathies suggests a growing interest in repurposing this class of agents for diseases characterized by abnormal nodal sodium channel distribution and hyperexcitability (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In the context of peripheral neuropathies, several previous studies using non-selective sodium channel blockers such as mexiletine have shown modest improvements in symptoms like muscle cramps in CMT patients (Herrmann, 2015). Nonetheless, these earlier compounds were limited by their lack of specificity. The therapeutic rationale for targeting Nav1.6 arises from its prominent expression at nodes of Ranvier and its contribution to persistent and resurgent sodium currents in both central and peripheral axons (Cazzato, 2020; Li et al., 2019). Despite the traditional use of broad-spectrum sodium channel blockers in conditions with hyperexcitability, selective blockers such as BIIB113 are far less explored in peripheral neuropathies and have not yet been directly applied to treating CMT. However, emerging preclinical evidence in rodent models – including Trembler-J and PMP22 duplication models – has demonstrated that selective modulation of Nav1.6 may lower ectopic sodium influx, improve compound action potential propagation, and ultimately enhance nerve conduction (Kaloyanova, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
BIIB113 operates via a state-dependent inhibition mechanism targeted specifically to the Nav1.6 voltage-gated sodium channel encoded by SCN8A. At the molecular level, BIIB113 exhibits a high degree of selectivity – for instance, it inhibits Nav1.6 with an IC₅₀ of approximately 0.051 µM, while demonstrating a higher IC₅₀ for other isoforms like Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 (Johnson et al., 2022; Zybura et al., 2021). By preferentially binding to Nav1.6 channels in their inactivated states, BIIB113 markedly suppresses the persistent and resurgent sodium currents that contribute to the sustained depolarizations and repetitive firing in hyperexcitable neurons. Persistent sodium currents—small, non-inactivating currents—that result from incomplete channel inactivation can amplify subthreshold depolarizations and foster ectopic firing. Similarly, resurgent sodium currents, which emerge during the repolarizing phase due to unique channel block and unblock kinetics, further facilitate high-frequency firing. BIIB113 is designed to reduce these pathological currents without interfering significantly with transient sodium currents essential for normal action potential initiation and conduction (Johnson et al., 2022; Zybura et al., 2021).

Nav1.6 is abundantly localized at the nodes of Ranvier, both in CNS and PNS axons, and plays a critical role in saltatory conduction—the rapid propagation of action potentials along myelinated fibers. In Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, disrupted paranodal architecture and demyelination lead to mislocalization of ion channels such as Nav1.6. This misdistribution is hypothesized to produce aberrant excitability, with increased persistent and resurgent currents that can ultimately culminate in conduction failure and ectopic firing (Cazzato, 2020; Israel, 2019). By binding selectively to Nav1.6 channels at these disorganized nodes, BIIB113 is expected to counteract the increased sodium influx, re-stabilize local membrane potentials, and enable more physiologically appropriate repolarization and action potential propagation. The molecular interactions involved include binding to amino acid residues that are preferentially exposed when Nav1.6 is in an inactivated conformation, thus offering the potential to normalize ionic homeostasis at the nodal regions (Johnson et al., 2022; Li et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
The proposed therapeutic hypothesis for BIIB113 in CMT suggests that by selectively inhibiting Nav1.6 hyperexcitability at regions with disorganized nodal architecture, it will reduce aberrant sodium currents that contribute to conduction failure. In preclinical rodent models reflective of CMT pathology – such as Trembler-J or PMP22 duplication models – electrophysiological assays (e.g., DRG patch-clamp recordings) have demonstrated that pharmacological blockade of Nav1.6 results in a reduction of ectopic, persistent sodium influx while simultaneously increasing the amplitude and velocity of compound action potentials in nerve conduction studies (Johnson et al., 2022; Kaloyanova, 2021). This implies that BIIB113 can improve conduction by dampening hyperexcitability in demyelinated or structurally compromised nerves. Moreover, pharmacokinetic studies have indicated that BIIB113 maintains sufficient peripheral nerve exposure at tolerable doses, suggesting that it may achieve the necessary local concentrations for effective Nav1.6 blockade without significant systemic side effects (Johnson et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Nav1.6 is not only critical for normal action potential propagation but also contributes to the generation of abnormal firing patterns in pathologic conditions. In CMT, where paranodal disruption is common, the mislocalization of Nav1.6 may lead to an aberrant increase in persistent and resurgent sodium currents, culminating in the failure of action potential propagation across demyelinated segments. By selectively reducing these currents, BIIB113 is expected to enhance the safety margin of action potential conduction, thereby stabilizing neuronal firing and improving overall nerve function. Given that peripheral nerves are the primary site of pathology in CMT and that Nav1.6 channels are expressed along the nodal regions of these nerves (Cazzato, 2020; Israel, 2019), this intervention could directly address one of the mechanistic underpinnings of the disease.

Furthermore, the hypothesis posits that BIIB113’s mechanism of action complements structural nodal repair. While gene therapies and myelin regeneration strategies are being developed to restore normal paranodal architecture, BIIB113 offers an adjunct pharmacological approach to immediately lower ectopic sodium influx and stabilize conduction until structural repair can be fully achieved. The combination of improved biophysical conduction profiles in preclinical models (demonstrated through electrophysiological assessments such as DRG patch-clamp recordings, compound action potential assays, and nerve conduction study enhancements) with favorable pharmacokinetics positions BIIB113 as a promising candidate to ameliorate the conduction deficits observed in CMT (Johnson et al., 2022; Kaloyanova, 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
BIIB113 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, particularly given its selective targeting of Nav1.6—a channel that has garnered interest primarily for its role in CNS hyperexcitability but is now recognized for its critical function in the peripheral nervous system as well. One of the principal strengths of BIIB113 is its impressive state-dependent mechanism that allows it to preferentially block pathological persistent and resurgent sodium currents while sparing normal transient currents. This specificity is crucial because it minimizes the risk of side effects that are often associated with broad-spectrum sodium channel blockers (Johnson et al., 2022; Zybura et al., 2021).

A further strength lies in its demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models; electrophysiological studies suggest that selective inhibition of Nav1.6 can restore normal conduction in rodent models exhibiting characteristics similar to those found in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. This is particularly significant given that the mislocalization and abnormal upregulation of Nav1.6 at disorganized nodes of Ranvier have been implicated in the pathophysiology of CMT, leading to ectopic firing and conduction block (Cazzato, 2020; Israel, 2019). In this context, BIIB113’s ability to enhance compound action potentials and reduce ectopic sodium influx addresses a key mechanism underlying the conduction failure in CMT. Additionally, preclinical pharmacokinetic studies confirming adequate peripheral nerve exposure at tolerated doses reinforce its potential as a clinically viable agent (Johnson et al., 2022).

However, several challenges must be noted. Despite the promising preclinical data, direct clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of BIIB113 in treating CMT is lacking. Most of the literature on BIIB113 centers on its development and application in SCN8A-related epilepsies, and even though the mechanistic rationale for repurposing it in CMT is strong, firm clinical trials and dedicated studies in CMT populations have not yet been reported (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, working in the peripheral nervous system poses distinct challenges: the differential expression of other sodium channel isoforms in peripheral nerves raises concerns that even a highly selective Nav1.6 blocker might elicit unforeseen off-target effects. For instance, though BIIB113 is designed to spare channels critical for normal conduction in muscle and cardiac tissue, the risk of collateral blockade in sensitive regions such as the phrenic nerve (which may express Nav1.6) has been noted for other similar compounds, potentially leading to respiratory issues if dosing is not carefully controlled (Klein et al., 2022).

A further consideration is the interplay between structural repair and electrophysiological stabilization in CMT therapy. While BIIB113 could provide an immediate reduction in aberrant excitability by normalizing ion channel function at disorganized nodes, it does not address the underlying demyelination or genetic defects that cause the nodal disarray. Thus, in a clinical setting, BIIB113 might best be used in combination with other therapies aimed at promoting remyelination or correcting structural abnormalities. In addition, the long-term effects of sustained Nav1.6 inhibition in peripheral nerves remain to be fully elucidated, especially given that Nav1.6 plays an important role in normal nerve physiology.

Despite these concerns, the molecular specificity and the mechanistic underpinnings of BIIB113 provide a robust rationale for its further investigation as a therapeutic agent in CMT. The current hypothesis – that BIIB113 will enhance conduction and reduce pathological hyperexcitability by selectively lowering persistent and resurgent sodium currents at disorganized nodes – is supported by detailed electrophysiological data in other contexts (Johnson et al., 2022; Kaloyanova, 2021). The translational potential of this approach is compelling, particularly in light of previous clinical experiences with sodium channel blockers in related peripheral neuropathies, such as the use of mexiletine for muscle cramps in CMT patients (Herrmann, 2015).

In summary, BIIB113 is a highly innovative compound with a clear molecular target and a strong state-dependent mechanism of action that holds promise for modulating the aberrant sodium currents associated with dysregulated nodes of Ranvier in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. Its strengths include:
– High potency and selectivity for Nav1.6, offering a precise method to modulate pathological persistent and resurgent currents (Johnson et al., 2022; Zybura et al., 2021).
– Favorable pharmacokinetic properties in preclinical studies, indicating reliable peripheral nerve exposure at therapeutically relevant concentrations (Johnson et al., 2022).
– A mechanistic hypothesis directly addressing the conduction failure observed in CMT due to mislocalized Nav1.6 channels at demyelinated or disorganized nodes (Cazzato, 2020; Israel, 2019).

Nevertheless, the weaknesses include:
– A significant gap in direct clinical or dedicated preclinical studies in CMT models; most available data derive from epilepsy-related investigations or models of neuropathic pain (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
– Uncertainties regarding potential off-target effects in peripheral tissues that may co-express Nav1.6, such as the phrenic nerve, raising safety concerns that must be thoroughly addressed in future studies (Klein et al., 2022).
– The need to consider BIIB113 as part of a multimodal therapeutic strategy, rather than a standalone treatment, due to its inability to directly correct the underlying demyelination and nodal structural abnormalities inherent to CMT.

Overall, BIIB113 shows significant promise as a therapeutic candidate for treating Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease by stabilizing action potential propagation through precise modulation of Nav1.6-mediated hyperexcitability. It represents a novel approach that can potentially complement structural repair modalities by addressing the electrophysiological dysfunction at disorganized nodes. However, before embarking on targeted clinical trials in CMT, further detailed preclinical studies in appropriate rodent models (e.g., Trembler-J and PMP22 duplication models) are needed to validate the mechanistic hypothesis, establish an optimized dosing regimen, and confirm the safety profile specific to the peripheral nervous system. With these additional data, BIIB113 could form a critical component of an integrated therapeutic strategy for CMT that combines molecular stabilization of conduction with longer-term structural repair interventions (Johnson et al., 2022; Kaloyanova, 2021).

Curcumin (Sigma-Aldrich catalog # C1386),"Proposal for Curcumin (Sigma-Aldrich catalog # C1386)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Curcumin is a bioactive polyphenolic compound naturally derived from the rhizome of the turmeric plant (Curcuma longa) and is one of the principal curcuminoids responsible for turmeric’s characteristic yellow pigment and medicinal properties (Adami & Bottai, 2022). It belongs to the diarylheptanoid class of polyphenols, a group well known for their antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and neuroprotective activities, and it has been appreciated in traditional Eastern medicine for over 4000 years (Adami & Bottai, 2022). Although curcumin can be isolated from natural sources, it is also available as a synthetic or semi-synthetic agent, and commercial preparations such as Sigma-Aldrich’s catalog # C1386 provide pharmaceutical-grade material for research and drug development (Adami & Bottai, 2022). Members of the curcuminoid family have historically been used to combat various inflammatory conditions, support general health, and serve as an adjunct in cancer and metabolic disease management due to their multifaceted biochemical properties (Adami & Bottai, 2022). As a repurposed drug candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, curcumin provides an attractive chemical scaffold because its molecular features allow it to interact with multiple signaling pathways implicated in neurodegenerative disorders (Adami & Bottai, 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Curcumin has a long-standing history of use both in traditional medicine and, more recently, as an investigational therapeutic in modern biomedical research (Adami & Bottai, 2022). Historically, it has been employed in Eastern medical systems for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and is currently marketed widely as a dietary supplement, albeit without formal regulatory approval for any specific indication (Adami & Bottai, 2022). Clinically, curcumin has been evaluated in various neurological conditions including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and neuropathic pain, where its properties have been shown to reduce neuroinflammation, inhibit oxidative stress, and modulate apoptotic pathways (Adami & Bottai, 2022). In preclinical models, particularly those relevant to neurodegeneration, curcumin displays the capacity to bind pathological protein aggregates such as amyloid-beta plaques in Alzheimer’s disease and modulate markers of neuroinflammation, suggesting a generalized mechanism of neuroprotection that could be leveraged in peripheral neuropathies such as CMT (Adami & Bottai, 2022). Specific to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, several preclinical studies in animal models, such as those involving MPZ mutation–driven neuropathies, have provided promising data that curcumin can reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, improve Schwann cell function, and potentially restore key components of myelin integrity (Morena et al., 2019; Patzkó et al., 2012; Roberts, 2012). Additionally, nanoformulated curcumin preparations (e.g., NanoCur) have been developed to overcome its poor bioavailability and have shown improved functional outcomes in rodent models of CMT1A, further supporting its repurposing for demyelinating peripheral neuropathies (Massry et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
Curcumin exerts its pleiotropic effects through multiple molecular mechanisms, the most relevant in the context of CMT being its capacity to modulate ER stress and activate adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways (Caillaud et al., 2020). In MPZ mutation–driven CMT, misfolded myelin protein zero is retained in the ER of Schwann cells, triggering sustained ER stress that ultimately impairs proteostasis and Schwann cell function; curcumin has been shown in cell culture models of MPZ mutations to reduce aggregated mutant protein levels and alleviate ER stress by modulating key UPR sensors such as PERK and IRE1α (Adami & Bottai, 2022; Caillaud et al., 2020). This modulation is achieved in part by a reduction in the expression of CHOP, a pro-apoptotic transcription factor induced during prolonged ER stress, and by facilitating the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery, which enhances the clearance of misfolded proteins (Patzkó et al., 2012; Clayton & Popko, 2016). Moreover, curcumin’s antioxidative properties contribute to its mechanism by scavenging reactive oxygen species, thereby limiting oxidative damage and further reducing cellular stress in Schwann cells (Adami & Bottai, 2022). In addition to these effects, curcumin has been implicated in modulating inflammatory signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine release from activated microglia and Schwann cells, which may also indirectly support proper protein trafficking and myelin maintenance (Adami & Bottai, 2022; Caillaud et al., 2020). Importantly, there is evidence from in vitro studies that curcumin can increase the cell surface expression of adhesion molecules such as Neurofascin-155 (NF155) and proper distribution of myelin proteins like PMP22 by normalizing ER trafficking defects, which are critical for the restoration of paranodal junctions in myelinated nerves (Morena et al., 2019; Massry et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
Based on its established mechanisms, the expected effect of curcumin in MPZ mutation–driven Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is multifold. In cell-based assays utilizing mutant Schwann cell models, curcumin is anticipated to mitigate ER stress by reducing the accumulation of misfolded MPZ and activating the UPR, which in turn improves proteostasis and facilitates the ER-associated degradation of aberrant proteins (Adami & Bottai, 2022; Caillaud et al., 2020). By lowering intracellular stress levels, curcumin is expected to allow correct trafficking of key myelin-associated proteins such as Neurofascin-155 and PMP22 to the nodal and paranodal regions, thereby restoring the structural integrity of paranodal junctions—a critical determinant of efficient nerve conduction and myelin stability (Morena et al., 2019; Massry et al., 2024). Electrophysiological assessments in animal models have shown that curcumin treatment, particularly when delivered via advanced nanoformulations, can improve nerve conduction velocities and enhance overall sensorimotor function, which is consistent with its hypothesized role in rescuing paranodal architecture and improving Schwann cell/myelin integrity (Massry et al., 2024; Caillaud et al., 2020). In vitro, flow cytometry analyses have demonstrated that curcumin increases surface expression of NF155 in Schwann cells, supporting its role in rescuing the correct localization of paranodal cell adhesion molecules (Adami & Bottai, 2022; Morena et al., 2019). Additionally, electron microscopy studies in preclinical models have provided visual evidence of reassembled paranodal loops and improved myelin ultrastructure following curcumin treatment (Massry et al., 2024; Patzkó et al., 2012). These combined effects suggest that, if effective, curcumin would fundamentally improve the molecular and cellular hallmarks of CMT by restoring the delicate balance of proteostasis in Schwann cells and thus rescuing nerve conduction deficits.

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of curcumin as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is promising from a mechanistic and preclinical standpoint but also tempered by several challenges. Strengths of curcumin include its well-documented safety profile, multifaceted activities against inflammation, oxidative stress, and ER stress, and its capacity to modulate key molecular pathways involved in proteostasis and UPR activation (Adami & Bottai, 2022). Its ability to increase the cell surface expression of crucial adhesion molecules like Neurofascin-155 and enhance the proper trafficking of PMP22 is particularly relevant for restoring paranodal junction integrity in MPZ mutation models, a mechanism that directly addresses one of the underlying pathologies in CMT (Morena et al., 2019; Massry et al., 2024). Furthermore, successful improvements in nerve conduction and myelin ultrastructure in preclinical rodent models treated with nanoformulated curcumin provide strong support for its potential translation into human therapies (Massry et al., 2024; Caillaud et al., 2020). However, weaknesses include the well-known issue of poor native bioavailability of curcumin due to its low aqueous solubility, rapid metabolism, and systemic elimination, which necessitates the use of advanced formulation strategies such as nanoparticles, liposomal encapsulation, or co-administration with bioenhancers like piperine (Adami & Bottai, 2022; Caillaud et al., 2020; Kong et al., 2023). Additionally, while preclinical data are encouraging, there remains a significant gap in clinical evidence directly supporting curcumin’s efficacy in human CMT patients, with most studies to date being limited to animal models and in vitro systems (Roberts, 2012; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Also, direct evidence showing the restoration of paranodal junctions and detailed mechanisms of how curcumin impacts the trafficking of Neurofascin-155 and PMP22 in the context of MPZ mutations is still being elucidated, and further targeted studies are needed to establish these effects unequivocally (Morena et al., 2019; Caillaud et al., 2020). Finally, the translation of curcumin’s molecular and cellular benefits from preclinical models to human disease remains a fundamental challenge common to many repurposed natural compounds. Despite these limitations, the cumulative mechanistic insights, especially regarding the improvement of proteostasis via UPR modulation, provide a strong rationale for advancing curcumin into more definitive translational studies focused on CMT (Adami & Bottai, 2022; Massry et al., 2024). In summary, curcumin offers a novel and multifaceted approach to address key pathogenic events in MPZ mutation–driven CMT, with its ability to reduce ER stress, modulate the unfolded protein response, and restore proper trafficking of critical paranodal proteins serving as compelling evidence of its potential. However, addressing its intrinsic bioavailability issues with advanced delivery systems and gathering robust clinical evidence in well-powered studies will be essential to confirm its utility as a therapeutic for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Adami & Bottai, 2022; Caillaud et al., 2020; Roberts, 2012).

In conclusion, curcumin—particularly when optimized via nanotechnology formulations—merits further investigation as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, with its unique molecular actions suggesting a rational basis for restoring paranodal structure and enhancing Schwann cell homeostasis. Continued preclinical work, combined with early-phase clinical trials, will be critical to confirming its potential efficacy and ultimately determining its place in the therapeutic arsenal against CMT (Adami & Bottai, 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Fingolimod-phosphate (FTY720-P; Cayman Chemical catalog # 11042),"Proposal for Fingolimod-phosphate (FTY720-P; Cayman Chemical catalog # 11042)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fingolimod-phosphate (FTY720-P) is the active phosphorylated metabolite of fingolimod (FTY720), a synthetic analogue originally derived from fungal metabolites such as myriocin (isolated from Isaria sinclairii). Fingolimod belongs to the class of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators, compounds that bind to and modulate the function of a family of G protein–coupled receptors known as S1P receptors. These receptors regulate cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Fingolimod is synthesized through chemical modifications of a natural fungal product, and its activity relies on in vivo phosphorylation by sphingosine kinases—predominantly sphingosine kinase 2—to yield FTY720-P, which then engages various S1P receptor subtypes. This class of compounds has a long history of use in immunomodulation, particularly in multiple sclerosis (MS), where fingolimod has been widely used for its ability to sequester lymphocytes within lymphoid tissues while also demonstrating potential direct effects on central nervous system (CNS) cells (Brinkmann et al., 2010; Chun, 2011).

Therapeutic History:
Fingolimod itself was first recognized for its immunomodulatory effects in organ transplantation models before its eventual development as an oral treatment for relapsing forms of MS. Extensive clinical trials in MS patients have established safe dosage regimens, favorable pharmacokinetics, and long-term tolerability. For instance, phase 1 and phase 3 trials confirmed fingolimod’s ability to modulate immune cell trafficking with a well-characterized safety profile, as seen in large clinical programs (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2005; Chun, 2011). Although the current literature does not report its direct use in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) Disease, there is a growing body of preclinical evidence suggesting that S1P receptor modulators may have utility in peripheral neuropathies. In particular, recent preclinical work with peripheral nerve explants from models with CMT-like pathology (such as Trembler-J mice) has demonstrated that treatment with FTY720-P increases Rac1-GTP levels and enhances paranodal protein (NF155) immunostaining, pointing to a potential application in nerve repair (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chun, 2011; Juif et al., 2016).

Mechanism of Action:
FTY720-P acts primarily as an agonist at multiple S1P receptor subtypes, most notably S1P1 and S1P3, although it also binds S1P4 and S1P5. Its immunomodulatory effects are chiefly mediated via S1P1 receptor functional antagonism, wherein sustained receptor internalization and degradation lead to sequestration of lymphocytes within lymph nodes, reducing their migration to inflammatory sites. Importantly for the potential treatment of CMT, fingolimod-phosphate’s activity at the S1P3 receptor on Schwann cells has been linked to the activation of small Rho GTPases—specifically Rac1 and Cdc42. These signaling molecules are key regulators of actin cytoskeleton reorganization, which is essential for the assembly and stabilization of paranodal septate junctions. Paranodal junctions are specialized axo-glial structures that anchor Schwann cell loops to the axon and are critical for maintaining nerve conduction velocity and overall myelin sheath integrity. Experimental data, including biochemical analyses in peripheral nerve explants from Trembler-J mice (a model relevant to CMT pathology), indicate that FTY720-P treatment enhances Rac1-GTP levels and promotes the immunostaining of NF155—a glial cell adhesion molecule critical for junction assembly—and presumably Caspr1, an axonal protein required for paranode integrity. These effects are proposed to be mediated by S1P3 receptor agonism, which augments Rac1/Cdc42 signaling pathways, ultimately promoting actin remodeling necessary for the restoration and maintenance of paranodal architecture (Leo et al., 2017; Chun, 2011; Mao-Draayer et al., 2017).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis is that FTY720-P will improve the pathological features of CMT by enhancing the assembly and stabilization of paranodal septate junctions in peripheral nerves. Specifically, by agonizing S1P3 receptors on Schwann cells, FTY720-P is expected to drive the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 signaling cascades. This activation will remodel the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating the proper assembly and maintenance of paranodal structures. In turn, improved cytoskeletal dynamics should restore the localized expression of critical junction proteins such as NF155 on the glial side and Caspr1 on the axonal side, thereby repairing the disrupted axo-glial junctions typically observed in demyelinating peripheral neuropathies like CMT. Functional assays on nerve conduction, as observed in preclinical models, further support that this restoration of paranodal architecture correlates with improved nerve conduction velocities and ultrastructural reattachment of paranodal loops. The expression of S1P3 receptors on Schwann cells and the documented ability of FTY720-P to activate downstream effectors such as Rac1/Cdc42 provide a molecular rationale for these expected outcomes (Park & Im, 2017; Juif et al., 2016; Pournajaf et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Fingolimod-phosphate (FTY720-P) represents a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, based on several converging lines of evidence. One of the primary strengths of this candidate is its well-established pharmacokinetic and safety profile in MS clinical trials, which provides a robust translational advantage. The extensive clinical use and long-term tolerability data mean that the risk profile is well understood, a critical factor when considering repurposing for a new indication. Furthermore, its mechanism of regulating S1P receptor signaling is well documented, and the emerging evidence that S1P3 receptor agonism can modulate Schwann cell biology by activating Rac1/Cdc42 is highly relevant to repairing paranodal junctions—a key pathological feature in CMT. The demonstration of increased Rac1-GTP levels and enhanced NF155 immunostaining in preclinical models (e.g., Trembler-J mice) is supportive of the hypothesis that FTY720-P can restore paranodal integrity and improve nerve conduction. Additionally, the dual action of fingolimod—modulating both immune cell trafficking and potentially exerting direct effects on neural and glial cells—might offer a broader therapeutic benefit in CMT, where both inflammatory and degenerative processes may be at play.

However, there are notable weaknesses and gaps that must be addressed. Despite promising preclinical data, there is as yet no direct clinical evidence that fingolimod-phosphate improves outcomes in CMT patients. The majority of available data stems from MS trials and in vitro or animal studies focusing on CNS demyelination rather than peripheral nerve repair. In addition, while the molecular signals downstream of S1P3 activation (Rac1/Cdc42) are implicated in actin remodeling and junction assembly, the precise modulation of these pathways in Schwann cells within a diseased peripheral nerve context remains to be fully elucidated. Potential off-target effects, particularly those mediated through S1P1 or other S1P receptor subtypes, may complicate the therapeutic index when aiming for a selective enhancement of paranodal junction assembly. Furthermore, fingolimod’s known cardiovascular effects—related to its S1P3-mediated actions in cardiac tissues—necessitate careful dose titration and monitoring, especially in populations that might have comorbidities. These issues underscore the need for additional focused preclinical studies in relevant CMT models as well as early-phase clinical trials that specifically evaluate nerve function, paranodal integrity, and overall clinical benefit in CMT patients (Chun, 2011; Leo et al., 2017; Pournajaf et al., 2022; Schira-Heinen et al., 2022).

Imatinib (c-Abl/PDGFR inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # SML1027),"Proposal for Imatinib (c-Abl/PDGFR inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # SML1027)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Imatinib, catalogued here as Sigma-Aldrich SML1027, is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) originally developed for use in oncology. It was synthesized as part of an effort to target aberrant tyrosine kinases observed in malignancies, and its core chemical structure is based on phenylaminopyrimidine derivatives. In its development, imatinib was optimized to bind the ATP-binding pocket of several kinases in their inactive conformations, specifically inhibiting BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), as well as other kinases like platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-kit. This compound belongs to the TKI class, which has historically been used to treat a variety of cancers—including CML and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST)—by arresting kinase-mediated signaling pathways that drive uncontrolled cell proliferation (Angelbello et al., 2018, pp. 40–42).

Therapeutic History:
The clinical and biochemical history of imatinib is well established in oncology. It has been administered for CML, where its inhibition of the BCR-ABL fusion protein leads to high rates of complete hematologic and cytogenetic responses (Angelbello et al., 2018, pp. 40–42). Beyond its primary use, imatinib and related TKIs have been repurposed in several experimental and clinical settings for diseases affecting the peripheral nervous system. For example, it has been investigated in the context of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) to treat plexiform neurofibromas arising from Schwann cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014). Moreover, its use has been explored in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) in both oncology trials and veterinary settings, highlighting its activity in nerve sheath–derived tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006). In models of immune-mediated neuropathies, such as experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN)—an animal model analogous to Guillain-Barré syndrome—imatinib has been shown to improve blood-nerve barrier integrity and preserve nerve function (Kmezic, 2025, pp. 108–113; Kmezic, 2025, pp. 22–29). However, despite these diversified applications, imatinib has not been widely used clinically to treat hereditary demyelinating neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. The reported preclinical evidence in CMT models—indicating improved conduction velocity and reduced nodal gap spacing—remains limited primarily to rodent studies and in vitro assays using dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cocultures (Bombieri et al., 2024, pp. 10–12; Fletcher, 2018, pp. 30–34).

Mechanism of Action:
Imatinib’s mechanism of action is based on its high-affinity binding to the ATP-binding pocket of specific tyrosine kinases. It is most well-known for inhibiting the BCR-ABL kinase, responsible for the malignant phenotype observed in CML, but importantly for the current evaluation, it also inhibits PDGFR and c-Abl. The PDGFR has a crucial role in mediating Schwann cell proliferation and differentiation; its overactivation can lead to aberrant Schwann cell behavior. In addition, c-Abl is implicated in the regulation of cytoskeletal elements, and its aberrant activation has been linked to cytoskeletal disorganization within Schwann cells and other cell types. This disorganization can disrupt the proper localization of critical paranodal adhesion molecules such as neurofascin 155 (NF155) on Schwann cells and contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) on axons. These proteins are essential for maintaining the integrity of the paranodal junctions, which in turn support saltatory conduction in peripheral nerves (Angelbello et al., 2018, pp. 40–42; Chang, 2011, pp. 12–15). By inhibiting PDGFR-mediated aberrant signaling and c-Abl-mediated cytoskeletal collapse, imatinib is hypothesized to restore stress fiber organization and enhance the clustering of NF155 and Caspr1 at the paranodes, thereby stabilizing these domains. Detailed preclinical evidence suggests that such molecular corrections can lead to improved nerve conduction parameters, as seen in studies where imatinib treatment improved conduction velocity and reduced nodal gap spacing in CMT1A rodent models (Bombieri et al., 2024, pp. 10–12; Fletcher, 2018, pp. 30–34).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, imatinib is expected to exert a stabilizing effect on paranodal domains in the context of CMT by targeting two critical aberrant signaling pathways in Schwann cells. First, via its inhibition of PDGFR, imatinib should reduce abnormal Schwann cell proliferation—an event associated with dedifferentiation and loss of myelinating function—in conditions where PDGF signaling is aberrantly elevated. Second, by inhibiting c-Abl, imatinib is anticipated to restore normal cytoskeletal organization, thereby allowing proper intracellular trafficking and surface localization of paranodal adhesion molecules such as NF155 and Caspr1. The proper clustering of these proteins is essential for the maintenance of paranodal junctions, which secure the axo-glial interface and ensure effective saltatory conduction. Indeed, in in vitro DRG cocultures, treatment with imatinib has been observed to lead to enhanced clustering of NF155 and Caspr1, suggesting an improved structural organization of the nodes of Ranvier. Additionally, in CMT1A rodent models, imatinib treatment has been correlated with improvements in electrophysiological parameters—such as increased conduction velocity—and structural improvements observed under electron microscopy, such as reduced nodal gap spacing. This implies that imatinib’s dual inhibitory action on PDGFR and c-Abl could translate into a restoration of myelination integrity, potentially slowing or reversing the progressive demyelinating process characteristic of CMT (Bombieri et al., 2024, pp. 10–12; Kmezic, 2025, pp. 87–90). Importantly, the peripheral nerve penetration characteristics of imatinib, paired with documented human pharmacokinetics and safety data from its oncological use, support its translational feasibility. PDGFR and c-Abl are expressed in Schwann cells and their associated molecular pathways are implicated in the pathogenesis of demyelinating neuropathies, which provides a biochemical rationale for expecting a therapeutic benefit in CMT (Angelbello et al., 2018, pp. 42–43; Fletcher, 2018, pp. 30–34).

Overall Evaluation:
The repurposing of imatinib for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease presents a compelling hypothesis based on both its established biochemical mechanisms and emerging preclinical data. One of the main strengths of this therapeutic candidate is its dual mechanism of action that targets both PDGFR and c-Abl signaling pathways. By addressing these pathways, imatinib has the potential not only to suppress aberrant Schwann cell proliferation but also to correct cytoskeletal disorganization, thereby restoring the localization of paranodal proteins essential for nodal maintenance and nerve conduction (Angelbello et al., 2018, pp. 40–42; Chang, 2011, pp. 12–15). In vitro data from DRG coculture assays and preclinical studies in CMT1A rodent models indicate that imatinib can enhance paranodal organization through increased clustering of NF155/Caspr1 and concomitantly improve electrophysiological parameters such as conduction velocity and nodal gap spacing (Bombieri et al., 2024, pp. 10–12; Fletcher, 2018, pp. 30–34).

Additionally, imatinib’s therapeutic history is robust given its extensive use in oncology with well-documented pharmacokinetic profiles, acceptable safety margins, and known peripheral nerve penetration. This established background facilitates the potential regulatory and translational pathway for repurposing imatinib in a non-oncological indication such as CMT. In vivo studies in animal models of immune-mediated neuropathies, where imatinib has been shown to restore blood-nerve barrier integrity and reduce neuroinflammation, further reinforce its capacity to modulate peripheral nerve physiology under pathologic conditions (Kmezic, 2025, pp. 108–113; Kmezic, 2025, pp. 22–29).

However, several concerns warrant careful consideration. First, while imatinib’s mechanism of action logically extends to potentially beneficial effects in CMT, the direct clinical use of imatinib in inherited demyelinating neuropathies such as CMT has not been previously reported or extensively explored. Most of the supporting evidence stems from oncology applications or studies in immune-mediated neuropathy models (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006). Second, there is an inherent risk that TKIs, including imatinib, may have off-target effects or induce peripheral neurotoxicity—which have been observed as adverse events in some patients receiving these drugs for cancer treatment (Laforgia et al., 2021, pp. 12–13). Therefore, distinguishing the neuroprotective effects expected from imatinib in CMT from potential neurotoxic side effects will be critical. Third, while preclinical data from rodent models and DRG cocultures are promising, they have yet to be robustly confirmed in large-scale or clinical studies specific to CMT. The heterogeneity of CMT subtypes and the variable expression of kinases in different genetic backgrounds may also influence therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, the precise mechanism by which imatinib modulates cytoskeletal organization and paranodal protein clustering in Schwann cells remains to be fully elucidated; additional mechanistic studies focusing on PDGFR/c-Abl signaling in Schwann cells would help to solidify the rationale for its use in CMT (Chang, 2011, pp. 12–15; Fletcher, 2018, pp. 30–34).

Overall, imatinib represents a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease due to its known mechanism of inhibiting PDGFR and c-Abl, which are implicated in Schwann cell dysfunction and paranodal disorganization in demyelinating neuropathies. Its established use in oncology provides a wealth of safety and pharmacokinetic data, and emerging preclinical evidence suggests that it can enhance paranodal protein clustering and improve nerve conduction parameters in rodent models of CMT. Nevertheless, the lack of direct clinical evidence in CMT, potential risks of neurotoxicity, and the need for further mechanistic studies in Schwann cell biology indicate that while the candidate is scientifically compelling, rigorous preclinical validation and cautious clinical trial design will be required to confirm its therapeutic potential (ClinicalTrials.gov; Kmezic, 2025, pp. 87–90; Litterman et al., 2014, p. 12). In summary, imatinib has significant strengths as a mechanistically rational candidate with excellent translational feasibility, yet its repurposing for CMT will require addressing key gaps in direct efficacy data and understanding its long-term effects on peripheral nerve structure and function.

"Clemastine Fumarate (Biogen formulation–equivalent to Tocris catalog # 2756)

Below is a detailed evaluation report addressing clemastine fumarate as a repurposed drug candidate for Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease.","Proposal for Clemastine Fumarate (Biogen formulation–equivalent to Tocris catalog # 2756)

Below is a detailed evaluation report addressing clemastine fumarate as a repurposed drug candidate for Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Clemastine fumarate is a synthetic compound originally developed as a first‐generation antihistamine. Its chemical synthesis was described using an invertive N→C aryl migration strategy starting from lithiated carbamates, yielding chemosynthetically pure clemastine that is subsequently converted into its fumarate salt to boost solubility and bioavailability (Fournier et al., 2010). As a member of the ethanolamine derivative class, clemastine belongs primarily to the histamine H1 receptor antagonist class. Historically, drugs in this class have been used for symptomatic relief of allergic conditions, such as hay fever, urticaria, and other histamine-mediated conditions. The compound’s long safety track record stems from its decades‐long clinical use in allergy management (Green et al., 2017). More recently, clemastine has been repositioned as a promyelinating agent after high-throughput screenings revealed that, beyond its classical antihistaminic effects, its off-target antimuscarinic activity can enhance the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and boost remyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) (Cree et al., 2018; Green et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, clemastine fumarate was approved and widely used as an over-the-counter medication for allergic rhinitis and similar allergic conditions due to its H1 receptor antagonist properties (Green et al., 2017). In the last decade, its repurposing has been driven by preclinical work that demonstrated its ability to enhance remyelination in CNS demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) (Cree et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2023). Preclinical models including the cuprizone-induced demyelination mouse model and models of optic neuritis have demonstrated that clemastine promotes oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin repair (Li et al., 2015; Cohen & Tesar, 2017). In the context of peripheral nerve diseases, evidence is more limited; however, emerging studies in rodent models of compression neuropathy have reported that clemastine improves electrophysiologic measures and enhances the expression of myelin proteins in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (Lee et al., 2021). Notably, clinical trial registry searches for clemastine fumarate in CMT specifically have returned no direct studies, and its historical use in either Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease or other classic peripheral neuropathies has not been reported; instead, most research has focused on central remyelination (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Nonetheless, there is preclinical evidence that clemastine’s ability to promote myelin repair in CNS and PNS models might extend to conditions such as CMT where Schwann cell dysfunction and paranodal junction instability play key roles.

Mechanism of Action:
The known mechanism of action for clemastine fumarate primarily involves antagonism of the histamine H1 receptor, a property long exploited in allergy treatment (Green et al., 2017). More recently, however, researchers have attributed its promyelinating effects to off-target antimuscarinic activity; specifically, clemastine antagonizes muscarinic receptors such as the M1 subtype expressed on glial cells (Cree et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2023). In the central nervous system, this antagonism leads to an elevation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which in turn promotes the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and enhances myelin membrane wrapping (Green et al., 2017). The hypothesis for peripheral nerve application extrapolates these findings to Schwann cells—the myelinating glial cells of the PNS. Schwann cells express a variety of muscarinic receptor subtypes (for example, M1 through M4), and antagonism may similarly elevate intracellular cAMP levels, a well-established second messenger in peripheral nerve regeneration (Lee et al., 2021). The elevation in cAMP is critical because it can upregulate proteins that are essential for paranodal septate junction assembly, including cell adhesion molecules such as Neurofascin-155 (NF155) and components like Caspr1, which are critical for the integrity of the axo-glial junction at paranodal regions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a; Lee et al., 2021). In CMT, a hereditary peripheral neuropathy characterized by demyelination, such a mechanism is desirable. The proposed action—H1 receptor blockade on Schwann cells resulting in elevated intracellular cAMP—could theoretically drive the upregulation of NF155 and Caspr1, leading to enhanced paranodal septate junction assembly. Such molecular events are believed to stabilize the myelin sheath and improve nerve conduction velocity (Lee et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b).

Expected Effect:
Based on prior experience in CNS demyelination models, the anticipated effect in a CMT context is that clemastine fumarate will accelerate the assembly of paranodal septate junctions by promoting Schwann cell differentiation and boosting myelin repair. The specific expectation is that clemastine’s H1 receptor antagonism on Schwann cells will lead to a rise in intracellular cAMP, a second messenger that is pivotal in promoting the expression of myelin-associated proteins. This includes the upregulation of NF155, a glial isoform of neurofascin critical at the paranodal regions, and Caspr1 (Contactin-associated protein 1), a molecule central to the proper formation of axo-glial junctions (Lee et al., 2021). In preclinical studies with rodent models mimicking peripheral nerve injury, clemastine treatment has been linked to improved electrophysiologic parameters such as increased compound muscle action potential amplitude and decreased nerve conduction latency, which likely result from enhanced myelin thickness and paranodal junction integrity (Lee et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Moreover, studies indicate that improvement of paranodal architecture correlates with better functional outcomes in peripheral demyelinating conditions; similar improvements have been reported in rat models of compression neuropathy where clemastine increased the ratio of P0-positive (a myelin protein) axons to neurofilament-positive axons (Lee et al., 2021). Given that Schwann cells naturally express both NF155 and Caspr1, and that disruption of the paranode is a hallmark of demyelinating neuropathies like CMT, the expected molecular responses—enhanced NF155 and Caspr1 expression—could help restore proper nodal gap widths and improve conduction velocity, leading to overall functional recovery (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b; Lee et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Clemastine fumarate presents a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease based on several notable strengths but also some weaknesses that warrant careful consideration.

One major strength lies in its well-characterized safety profile and clinical experience over decades of use in allergy management, which would support rapid clinical repurposing; a favorable safety record is essential when considering treatments for chronic conditions such as CMT (Green et al., 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Its synthetic origin, documented by robust methods described in the literature (Fournier et al., 2010), assures that the formulation is chemically well-defined and can be produced reproducibly at high quality. Preclinical studies in both CNS demyelinating disorders and peripheral nerve models have provided compelling evidence of its ability to enhance remyelination, with rodent data showing improved histomorphometric and electrophysiological indicators after treatment (Cree et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2021).

Another strength is the hypothesized mechanism of action: by antagonizing H1 receptors on Schwann cells, clemastine may elevate intracellular cAMP, which is known to promote glial differentiation and myelin repair. This mechanism is supported by analogous effects observed in oligodendrocytes in CNS models, suggesting a translational potential to Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system (Lee et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2023). If clemastine can indeed upregulate NF155 and Caspr1 in Schwann cells, it will offer a novel therapeutic avenue for directly addressing the paranodal junction defects observed in CMT, which underlie many of the conduction deficits seen in these patients.

However, the candidate also has several weaknesses that must be addressed. First, despite its robust history in CNS remyelination studies, there is a notable lack of direct clinical trials or comprehensive studies in Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. Searches in clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b) have returned zero direct trials, meaning that the proposed benefit in CMT is still largely hypothetical. Second, while preclinical evidence in peripheral nerve models such as compression neuropathy is promising, these models do not perfectly mimic the genetic and biochemical complexities of CMT, particularly forms like CMT1A where dysmyelination is driven by genetic overexpression of peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) and other factors (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a; Lee et al., 2021). Moreover, the mechanistic link between H1 receptor antagonism and upregulation of specific paranodal proteins in Schwann cells remains inferential; while increased cAMP is known to favor myelination, direct evidence linking clemastine-induced cAMP elevation to NF155 and Caspr1 upregulation in Schwann cells is still emerging (Lee et al., 2021).

Another weakness is the possibility that the dosing regimens optimized for CNS remyelination may not be directly translatable to peripheral nerve disorders, where pharmacokinetic distribution and the local microenvironment may differ significantly. Although pharmacokinetic studies suggest that clemastine has peripheral nerve penetration (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a), it remains to be determined whether the effective concentration at the level of Schwann cells in human peripheral nerves can be achieved without eliciting adverse side effects, particularly given the anticholinergic properties and known sedative effects of clemastine under standard dosing regimens (Green et al., 2017; Turski et al., 2018).

In summary, clemastine fumarate is a well-known antihistamine repurposed as a remyelinating agent, with clear evidence of efficacy in CNS models and preliminary peripheral nerve models that suggest promise for treating peripheral demyelinating conditions such as CMT. Its origins as a chemically well-characterized compound with a longstanding clinical safety record strengthen its candidacy, and the hypothesized mechanism—blocking H1 receptors on Schwann cells, thereby raising cAMP and enhancing paranodal junction protein expression—is scientifically plausible based on analogous mechanisms in CNS glia. However, there is a critical gap in direct evidence: no clinical trials have yet been conducted in CMT patients, and the specific link between H1 antagonism and upregulation of NF155 and Caspr1 in Schwann cells remains to be conclusively demonstrated. These gaps necessitate further preclinical studies specifically addressing peripheral nerve regeneration and detailed mechanistic investigations using genetic or pharmacological models of CMT. Additionally, optimizing the dosing schedule for peripheral applications while minimizing adverse side effects represents another hurdle that will have to be overcome in future work (Lee et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b; Jiang et al., 2023).

Overall, while clemastine fumarate appears to be a promising candidate for repurposing in CMT due to its dual role in promoting remyelination and its known safety profile, the current literature supports further dedicated preclinical and mechanistic studies in peripheral nerve models before clinical translation. The strengths of established pharmacology, a well-defined synthesis route, and preliminary evidence of peripheral nerve activity make it worth pursuing. At the same time, the critical weaknesses – including the absence of direct clinical evidence in CMT and the need for clearer demonstration of its proposed molecular effects in Schwann cells – must be addressed by the research team through targeted experiments and pilot studies (Lee et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a; Jiang et al., 2023).

In conclusion, clemastine fumarate represents an intriguing and mechanistically plausible candidate for accelerating paranodal junction assembly via H1 receptor antagonism in Schwann cells. Its proven central remyelination effects, backed by decades of clinical use for allergy, and emerging data in peripheral nerve models provide a strong foundation for further exploration. Nonetheless, the transition from CNS to PNS applications involves significant translational challenges that need to be rigorously studied through appropriate in vivo and in vitro models of CMT to confirm whether the hypothesized upregulation of NF155 and Caspr1 can indeed translate into functional recovery in patients (Lee et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a).

This comprehensive literature evaluation ultimately supports the continuation of focused preclinical research on clemastine fumarate for CMT. The research team should design experiments that address the dosing requirements for optimal peripheral nerve penetration, validate the increase in intracellular cAMP in Schwann cells upon clemastine treatment, and quantify the changes in paranodal protein expression relative to functional outcomes. Given the drug’s established clinical profile, a successful preclinical validation could rapidly propel this candidate toward a phase II clinical trial in CMT patients, thereby significantly impacting therapeutic options for this debilitating peripheral neuropathy (Lee et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b).

Forskolin (adenylate cyclase activator; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # F6886),"Proposal for Forskolin (adenylate cyclase activator; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # F6886)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Forskolin is a naturally occurring diterpenoid extracted primarily from the roots of Coleus forskohlii and has been historically used in traditional herbal medicine. It belongs to the class of adenylate cyclase activators, a group of compounds well known for their capacity to increase intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Forskolin was originally isolated and characterized for its ability to activate transmembrane adenylate cyclases, making it a valuable biochemical tool for examining cAMP-mediated signaling pathways in various cell types, including neurons and glial cells. This compound is commercially available (for example, from Sigma-Aldrich catalog # F6886) and has been widely employed in in vitro studies to simplify the modulation of cAMP-dependent cascades. Its use as a probe in retinal cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and other tissues underscores its broad impact as an experimental tool. In the context of peripheral nerve biology, forskolin has been leveraged to study Schwann cell physiology and their transition from a proliferative state to a differentiated, myelinating state (Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 29–30; Bacallao & Monje, 2013, pp. 1–2).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, forskolin has been applied in a range of biochemical and preclinical studies rather than as a frontline clinical therapeutic for any specific demyelinating disorder. Biochemically, it has been used as the “gold standard” compound to elevate cAMP in cellular systems, thereby elucidating the role of the cAMP pathway in cell differentiation, gene expression, and cytoskeletal organization. Preclinically, forskolin’s cAMP-elevating capabilities have been exploited in studies using dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cocultures to drive Schwann cell differentiation and to increase markers associated with myelination, such as myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) and neurofascin 155 (NF155) (Bacallao & Monje, 2013, pp. 14–15; Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 13–16). Despite its extensive use in laboratory research and exploratory studies in peripheral nerve repair models (for example, in Trembler-J rat models), there have been no registered clinical trials specifically evaluating forskolin for the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease or related peripheral neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov). This absence of clinical trial data reflects both the historical focus of forskolin as a research tool and the challenges involved in translating in vitro effects into proven clinical outcomes. However, evidence from biochemical and animal model studies—including those examining improvements in conduction velocity and nodal architecture in demyelinating conditions—provides a promising rationale for its repurposing as an adjunct therapy for disorders characterized by Schwann cell dysfunction (Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 25–26).

Mechanism of Action:
Forskolin’s primary mechanism of action is its direct activation of transmembrane adenylate cyclase, leading to an increase in intracellular cAMP. The elevation in cAMP acts as a second messenger that, in turn, activates multiple downstream effectors. Two central pathways are activated by increased cAMP: protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC). PKA phosphorylates a range of intracellular targets, including transcription factors (e.g., CREB) and proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement, which are essential for gene expression modulation, cellular differentiation, and myelin sheath formation. EPAC, on the other hand, acts through Rap1 signaling and contributes to processes that appear to have a more selective role in promoting Schwann cell differentiation and the synthesis of myelin proteins (Bacallao & Monje, 2013, pp. 4–5, 15–16). Preclinical data indicate that forskolin-induced cAMP elevation increases the expression of transcriptional regulators like Krox-20, which plays a critical role in the transition of Schwann cells from an immature to a myelinating state. Additionally, studies in primary Schwann cell cultures and DRG cocultures have shown that forskolin treatment enhances the expression of several myelin-related proteins, including MAG, P0, and NF155, thereby implicating a role in the assembly of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that define nodal and paranodal architecture (Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 22–23; Bacallao & Monje, 2013, pp. 8–10). Importantly, forskolin appears to preferentially activate the PKA branch of cAMP signaling; however, the balance between PKA and EPAC activation is critical, as excessive PKA activity may promote proliferation rather than full differentiation—an insight derived from studies showing that selective cAMP analogs can impact Schwann cells differently (Bacallao & Monje, 2013, pp. 2–4). Thus, forskolin’s molecular action involves an intricate interplay between the cAMP levels generated via tmAC activation and the downstream PKA- and EPAC-mediated pathways, which then drive transcriptional programs leading to cytoskeletal reorganization, myelin gene expression, and the proper assembly and localization of CAMs at nodes and paranodes (Jacobs, 2021, pp. 5–7).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, the expected effect of forskolin in assays designed to evaluate its action on peripheral nerve repair—and specifically on Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease—would be multifaceted. In in vitro DRG-Schwann cell cocultures, forskolin is expected to elevate cAMP levels in Schwann cells, resulting in enhanced expression of myelin proteins such as MAG and NF155, which are critical for the formation and maintenance of paranodal junctions. Increased PKA activity resulting from forskolin treatment is anticipated to promote the phosphorylation and proper membrane localization of NF155, thereby improving the assembly of paranodal domains vital for saltatory conduction (Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 23–25; Malone et al., 2013, pp. 5–7). In parallel, activation of EPAC signaling could facilitate cytoskeletal remodeling, an event that is necessary for the morphological differentiation of Schwann cells and for the formation of mature myelin sheaths. In vivo, topical administration of forskolin in animal models—such as the Trembler-J rat model, which has been used to recapitulate aspects of the demyelinating pathology seen in CMT—has been associated with improvements in nerve conduction velocity and nodal architecture (Park et al., 2018, pp. 14–16). Preclinical studies suggest that by elevating cAMP, forskolin can “prime” Schwann cells for differentiation and enhance the repair of nodal and paranodal structures, thereby restoring efficient nerve conduction and ameliorating motor deficits. These expected outcomes are supported by evidence that cAMP elevation, through pharmacological agents like forskolin or by inhibition of PDE enzymes, leads to upregulation of transcription factors (e.g., Krox-20) and myelin proteins (e.g., P0, MAG), which are central to myelination processes and nodal organization (Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 27–29; Jacobs, 2021, pp. 17–18).

Overall Evaluation:
In our evaluation of forskolin as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, several strengths and weaknesses emerge from the literature.

One major strength lies in forskolin’s well-characterized mechanism of action: its capacity to elevate intracellular cAMP levels through direct activation of adenylate cyclase is robustly documented and has been shown to drive both Schwann cell proliferation and differentiation. The dual activation of PKA and EPAC offers a biologically plausible mechanism by which forskolin can enhance the expression of key transcription factors such as Krox-20, a master regulator of myelin gene expression, and promote the synthesis and proper localization of myelin-associated proteins like MAG and NF155, which are essential for nodal and paranodal repair (Bacallao & Monje, 2013, pp. 1–2; Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 19–22). This is particularly encouraging since dysregulation of these molecular events is central to the pathogenesis of CMT1A, a demyelinating neuropathy. Preclinical studies discussed in the literature indicate that forskolin-treated DRG cocultures exhibit increased expression of myelin genes and enhanced junction assembly, lending further support to its mechanism (Malone et al., 2013, pp. 5–7; Monk et al., 2009, p. 8).

Another positive attribute is the favorable pharmacokinetic profile reported in peripheral nerve studies; forskolin has been shown to penetrate peripheral nerves effectively, and its established safety profile in biochemical and clinical contexts (as evidenced by prior clinical use in non-neurological conditions) alleviates concerns about serious toxicity. This safety aspect is reinforced by the absence of serious adverse effects in experimental models, making forskolin a compelling candidate for repurposing in a clinical setting for CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov).

However, there are important limitations. Although forskolin robustly elevates cAMP and drives certain aspects of Schwann cell differentiation, several studies report that forskolin alone may be insufficient to trigger full myelination. For example, in isolated Schwann cell systems, forskolin-induced cAMP elevation can enhance early differentiation markers, yet without additional signals—such as those provided by axonal contact or co-factors like ascorbate—the cells often fail to produce mature myelin proteins such as myelin basic protein (MBP) (Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 13–16; Bacallao & Monje, 2013, pp. 2–4). This suggests that while forskolin’s molecular mechanism is sound, its therapeutic efficacy might rely on combination therapies or adjunct approaches to fully realize remyelination and nodal/paranodal repair in the complex in vivo environment of peripheral nerves. Furthermore, there is evidence that forskolin preferentially stimulates the PKA pathway, which, in some contexts, may promote proliferation at the expense of differentiation, unless carefully balanced with EPAC activation (Bacallao & Monje, 2013, pp. 15–16). The differential sensitivity of these downstream pathways indicates that the dosing and delivery method of forskolin will need to be finely tuned—a challenge in drug formulation and clinical translation.

Another consideration is the clinical trial landscape. Although extensive preclinical data exists for forskolin in related models of demyelination and peripheral neuropathy, there is a notable absence of registered clinical trials directly evaluating forskolin for CMT or similar demyelinating diseases. This gap in the literature means that while the biochemical rationale is robust, the translation into clinical benefit remains unproven at this stage (ClinicalTrials.gov; Jacobs, 2021, pp. 20–22).

Furthermore, comparative studies using PDE inhibitors (such as PDE4D inhibitors) have shown promising results in elevating cAMP levels and enhancing Schwann cell differentiation, sometimes with more selective targeting than forskolin. These studies provide a benchmark against which forskolin’s performance can be measured, and they underscore the importance of achieving the correct balance between proliferative and differentiative signals (Jacobs, 2021, pp. 1–5; Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 27–29). Such comparisons suggest that while forskolin has mechanistic validity, its potency and specificity relative to emerging PDE inhibitors will be critical determinants of its ultimate utility.

In summary, the overall evaluation is cautiously optimistic. Forskolin’s longstanding use as a research tool, its clearly defined mechanism of enhancing cAMP levels via adenylate cyclase activation, and its downstream effects on PKA and EPAC pathways constitute a strong biochemical foundation for its potential utility in promoting Schwann cell differentiation and remyelination. This mechanism is directly relevant to addressing the pathological features of CMT, particularly by upregulating myelin gene expression and promoting cytoskeletal reorganization that supports proper CAM assembly at nodal and paranodal regions. Nevertheless, the challenges include its possible insufficiency as a monotherapy for complete myelin repair, the need to balance proliferative versus differentiative signaling, and the current lack of clinical trial evidence in CMT populations. As such, while forskolin holds promise as an adjunct therapy and a tool for further investigation in preclinical models of CMT, additional studies—especially those incorporating combinatory approaches with other regulatory signals and longer-term in vivo assessments—will be critical to fully validate its therapeutic potential (Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 25–26; Jacobs, 2021, pp. 22–29; Monk et al., 2009, p. 8; Park et al., 2018, pp. 14–16).

Overall, our evaluation supports further investigation of forskolin in well-controlled preclinical models that mimic the pathophysiological features of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Key experimental approaches should include in vitro DRG-Schwann cell coculture assays to confirm enhanced expression of myelin markers (MAG, NF155, P0) and proper nodal/paranodal junction assembly, as well as in vivo studies in Trembler-J rat models to assess functional improvements in nerve conduction and motor performance. Given forskolin’s established safety profile and predictable pharmacokinetics in peripheral nerve tissues, combined with its robust activation of cAMP-dependent signaling, it represents a promising candidate for repurposing as an adjunct therapy in CMT. However, meticulous formulation and dosing strategies, potentially in combination with other agents like ascorbate or neuregulin analogs, will be essential to overcome the limitations observed in isolated systems. Ultimately, while the biochemical rationale is compelling, bridging the gap between cellular studies and clinical benefit will require rigorous preclinical validation followed by carefully designed clinical trials. This multifaceted evaluation informs our research direction and strongly supports the continuation of detailed studies on forskolin as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Bacallao & Monje, 2015, pp. 29–30; Jacobs, 2021, pp. 5–7; Brewer et al., 2014, pp. 11–12; Choi et al., 2015, p. 6; Hörner et al., 2022, pp. 34–35).

ACY-738 (HDAC6 inhibitor; MedChemExpress catalog # HY-11010),"Proposal for ACY-738 (HDAC6 inhibitor; MedChemExpress catalog # HY-11010)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
ACY-738 is a fully synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor developed as a selective modulator of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). It belongs to the class of aromatic hydroxamate-based inhibitors, more specifically, pyrimidine hydroxyl amide derivatives, that have been optimized for high isoform selectivity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. The chemical design of ACY-738 follows the classic pharmacophore of HDAC inhibitors comprising three essential domains: a zinc-binding group (ZBG) capable of chelating the catalytic Zn²⁺ ion in the HDAC active site, a hydrophobic linker that spans the channel to the active site, and a cap group that interacts with the surface residues surrounding the pocket. ACY-738 was identified in parallel with related compounds such as ACY-775, ACY-1215 (Ricolinostat), and ACY-241 (Citarinostat) by medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at improving selectivity toward HDAC6 with optimized brain penetration and oral bioavailability (Jochems et al., 2014; Vergani et al., 2019). Its synthesis, although not fully detailed in the provided excerpts, is known to involve the construction of a hydroxamate moiety linked to a heterocyclic scaffold—often a pyrimidine—that confers both its potency and selectivity profiles. This chemical class has historically been used in both oncology and neurodegenerative contexts, relying on the ability of the hydroxamate group to stably coordinate with zinc ions in the catalytic site of HDAC family enzymes while the cap group enables isoform discrimination (Xiao & Zhang, 2020; Kalin & Bergman, 2013).

Therapeutic History:
HDAC6 inhibitors as a drug class have been widely explored for their potential to modulate non-histone substrate acetylation, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, certain cancers, and autoimmune disorders. Pan and isoform-selective HDAC inhibitors have been in clinical development for cancer due to their capacity to perturb epigenetic and proteostatic regulation; however, the broad-spectrum inhibitors suffer from high toxicity and limited brain penetration. In contrast, selective HDAC6 inhibitors—by virtue of their minimal effect on nuclear histones—offer a more favorable safety profile. ACY-738 is one such inhibitor that has been studied preclinically for its antidepressant-like and neuroprotective properties owing to its ability to rapidly penetrate the brain and modulate the acetylation state of non-histone proteins such as α-tubulin and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) (Jochems et al., 2014; Xiao & Zhang, 2020). Although there is no record in the provided context of ACY-738 being used clinically specifically for Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, its favorable pharmacokinetic profile, robust selectivity for HDAC6, and evidence from models of peripheral neuropathy and neurodegeneration suggest potential utility in peripheral nerve diseases, including CMT. In preclinical settings, HDAC6 inhibitors have been shown to improve phenotypes in models of proteotoxic stress and neurodegeneration; for example, HDAC6 knockout mice display largely normal development, suggesting that inhibition can be well tolerated (Batchu et al., 2016). Moreover, similar compounds have been reported to reduce protein aggregate burden and improve myelination in PMP22-overexpressing Schwann cells—a model relevant to CMT disease pathology—supporting the broader therapeutic use of ACY-738 in diseases characterized by disrupted proteostasis (Hideshima et al., 2016; Vergani et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, HDAC6 is a unique member of the histone deacetylase family because it harbors two catalytic domains as well as a zinc finger ubiquitin-binding domain (ZnF-UBP). Unlike class I HDACs that primarily target histones and thus regulate chromatin structure, HDAC6 predominantly deacetylates non-histone substrates located in the cytoplasm. Key among its substrates is α-tubulin, where deacetylation by HDAC6 influences microtubule stability and cell motility (Batchu et al., 2016). In addition to tubulin, HDAC6 also targets heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a molecular chaperone critical for the folding and trafficking of a host of client proteins. HSP90 acetylation modulated by HDAC6 impairs its chaperone function, affecting the processing and maturation of client proteins such as neurofascin-155 (NF155), a cell-adhesion molecule necessary for paranodal assembly in myelinated nerves (Shen & Kozikowski, 2020; Jochems et al., 2014). By inhibiting HDAC6, ACY-738 is postulated to block the deacetylation of HSP90, leading to an increase in HSP90 acetylation. This modification of HSP90 is believed to enhance its chaperone activity, thereby facilitating the proper folding, trafficking, and localization of paranodal CAMs to the nodes and paranodes of myelinated fibers (Xiao & Zhang, 2020; Kalin & Bergman, 2013). Furthermore, selective HDAC6 inhibition might contribute to the clearance of misfolded protein aggregates via promotion of the aggresome-autophagy pathway, further alleviating proteotoxic stress in Schwann cells (Batchu et al., 2016; Lechner et al., 2022). These biochemical interactions—where the hydroxamate moiety of ACY-738 chelates the catalytic zinc ion within the CD2 domain of HDAC6 while the cap group secures selectivity—form the mechanistic basis by which ACY-738 modulates the acetylation status of key proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and protein quality control (Jochems et al., 2014; Xiao & Zhang, 2020).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis underpinning the use of ACY-738 in the treatment of CMT is that HDAC6-mediated deacetylation of HSP90 perturbs its chaperone function, resulting in the mislocalization of paranodal CAMs such as NF155 and Caspr1. This mislocalization leads to impaired paranodal junction assembly and, consequently, defective nodal gap architecture—a hallmark of some forms of CMT. With ACY-738, the expected therapeutic effect is multifold. First, by inhibiting HDAC6, ACY-738 should increase the acetylation of HSP90. Elevated HSP90 acetylation restores or enhances its chaperone capacity, which is critical for the proper folding and delivery of proteins like NF155 to target regions within Schwann cells (Xiao & Zhang, 2020; Shen & Kozikowski, 2020). Second, improved chaperone-mediated trafficking of paranodal CAMs is anticipated to facilitate the reassembly of septate junctions at the paranode, thereby restoring nodal integrity and function. Third, independent preclinical findings have demonstrated that HDAC6 inhibitors can reduce protein aggregate accumulation—a beneficial effect in cells stressed by misfolded proteins such as mutant PMP22 in CMT models—which may lead to improved myelination and overall nerve function (Hideshima et al., 2016; Vergani et al., 2019). Lastly, the favorable pharmacokinetic profile of ACY-738—with systemic distribution encompassing both central and peripheral compartments—ensures that the compound can reach Schwann cells in peripheral nerves where the disease pathology is observed (Jochems et al., 2014; Xiao & Zhang, 2020). Collectively, the restoration of paranodal architecture is expected to translate into improved nerve conduction velocity and clinical amelioration of the motor and sensory deficits seen in CMT patients.

Overall Evaluation:
Based on a comprehensive review of current literature, ACY-738 shows strong promise as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease by addressing fundamental biochemical derangements implicated in disease pathogenesis. One significant strength is its high degree of selectivity for HDAC6, enabling it to target the deacetylation of non-histone substrates such as HSP90 and alpha-tubulin without producing the broader epigenetic perturbations associated with pan-HDAC inhibition (Jochems et al., 2014; Xiao & Zhang, 2020). The ability of ACY-738 to modulate HSP90 acetylation is particularly noteworthy, as it aligns well with the therapeutic hypothesis that enhanced chaperone function may correct the mislocalization of paranodal cell adhesion molecules critical for maintaining nodal gap architecture. Preclinical data indicating that related HDAC6 inhibitors decrease protein aggregate formation and improve myelination in models of proteostasis stress further support the candidate’s potential for addressing CMT-specific pathology (Batchu et al., 2016; Hideshima et al., 2016). Its favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including pronounced CNS and peripheral distribution coupled with a lack of significant acute toxicity, bolster its candidacy as a repurposed treatment for peripheral nerve disorders such as CMT (Jochems et al., 2014; Xiao & Zhang, 2020).

Nonetheless, there are several challenges and uncertainties that must be addressed. First, while the mechanism linking enhanced HSP90 acetylation to the proper trafficking of paranodal CAMs like NF155 is plausible, direct evidence in CMT models remains limited. Further detailed studies are needed to establish that ACY-738 not only increases HSP90 acetylation but also directly leads to normalized distribution of these key proteins in Schwann cells affected by PMP22 overexpression or other CMT-associated molecular abnormalities. Secondly, although preclinical studies in other disease models, such as Alzheimer’s and certain cancers, have shown beneficial outcomes with HDAC6 inhibitors, the translation of these effects to a peripheral neuropathy context, especially in a chronic condition like CMT, requires rigorous testing in relevant animal models and eventually in early-phase clinical trials. Finally, long-term safety, particularly with respect to off-target effects or potential resistance mechanisms that might arise in chronic treatment scenarios, remains to be determined (Kalin & Bergman, 2013; Lechner et al., 2022).

Overall, ACY-738 is a strong candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease due to its highly selective inhibition of HDAC6, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and mechanistic rationale targeting both proteostatic stress and defective paranodal protein trafficking. The compound’s design as a hydroxamate-based pyrimidine derivative positions it within a well-studied class of HDAC6 inhibitors that have demonstrated efficacy in multiple in vivo models of neurodegeneration and proteotoxicity. Its ability to modulate HSP90 acetylation is particularly critical, as this molecular interaction underpins the hypothesis that proper chaperone-mediated trafficking of paranodal cell adhesion molecules can restore nodal gap architecture in CMT-affected nerves. Although further work is needed to validate these mechanisms in dedicated CMT models and to ensure long-term tolerability, the overall evaluation supports advancing ACY-738 through preclinical studies with the goal of establishing its efficacy in ameliorating the peripheral neuropathy associated with CMT (Jochems et al., 2014; Batchu et al., 2016; Xiao & Zhang, 2020).

Benztropine (mAChR antagonist; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # B1253),"Proposal for Benztropine (mAChR antagonist; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # B1253)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Benztropine is a synthetic small molecule originally developed and clinically approved for use as an antiparkinsonian agent, leveraging its role as a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist. It is commercially available, for example, from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog # B1253), and belongs to the pharmacological class of anticholinergic agents. Historically, benztropine was discovered through efforts to counteract cholinergic overactivity and reduce extrapyramidal symptoms in Parkinson’s disease. Its chemical structure was optimized for optimal receptor binding to mAChRs, particularly targeting the M1, M3, and M5 subtypes. As a member of the anticholinergic therapeutic class, benztropine has been widely investigated for its potential effects beyond its original neurological indications, including modulation of neuronal excitability and remyelination. Recent repurposing initiatives have begun to explore its potential to promote myelination by antagonizing inhibitory muscarinic signaling in glial cells, leading to the hypothesis that similar mechanisms may be harnessed in peripheral Schwann cells (Cerles et al., 2019; Deshmukh et al., 2013).

Therapeutic History:
Benztropine has a long clinical history for treating Parkinsonism, where its antimuscarinic and antihistaminergic actions help alleviate motor symptoms by modulating central cholinergic tone. Preclinical studies have also examined benztropine’s effects on oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and myelination in central nervous system (CNS) models of demyelination, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and cuprizone-induced demyelination. In these models, benztropine has been shown to enhance remyelination by promoting the differentiation of OPCs into mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes, leading to improved conduction properties and neurological recovery. Moreover, in the context of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), studies using oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy models in mice have demonstrated that benztropine can exert neuroprotective effects by preserving nerve conduction velocity and maintaining myelin integrity. Although there are few direct clinical trials using benztropine for demyelinating diseases or specifically for Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease, the candidate therapy’s observed ability to improve nerve conduction and modulate cellular pathways involved in myelination in peripheral models suggests translational promise. There is also emerging evidence using dorsal root ganglia (DRG) coculture systems that benztropine can upregulate key paranodal proteins such as neurofascin-155 (NF155) and contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) that are critical for node of Ranvier integrity. The cumulative preclinical evidence from CNS demyelination studies, CIPN models, and preliminary DRG coculture findings has provided the rationale for extending benztropine’s evaluation to peripheral demyelinating disorders like CMT (Castelnovo & Sforza, 2017; Cerles et al., 2019; Deshmukh et al., 2013).

Mechanism of Action:
At a molecular level, benztropine acts primarily by antagonizing muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). In the central nervous system, it has been documented to target M1 and M3 receptor subtypes on OPCs, effectively blocking the negative regulatory influence of muscarinic signaling on cell differentiation. In vitro experiments have shown that benztropine inhibits carbachol-induced calcium influx in OPCs, thereby reducing activation of pathways that normally prevent differentiation. Specifically, blockade of muscarinic receptors has been associated with reduced activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and a concurrent decrease in Notch1 signaling, both of which are known to restrain oligodendrocyte maturation. This mechanism results in increased expression of myelin-associated proteins such as myelin basic protein (MBP), and an elevation of mature oligodendrocyte markers. Biochemical studies indicate that other muscarinic antagonists induce similar OPC differentiation, reinforcing benztropine’s specific action via mAChR blockade. The hypothesis driving its repurposing for CMT builds on the analogy between oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), wherein muscarinic receptors are also expressed. In Schwann cells, M1 receptor signaling has been implicated in maintaining elevated levels of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP); when antagonized by benztropine, the resulting increase in cAMP levels can lead to enhanced phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB) and upregulation of structural proteins critical for paranodal architecture. This cascade is thought to promote the re-establishment of septate-like junctions through increased expression of proteins such as NF155 and Caspr1, which in turn normalize nodal gap spacing and improve nerve conduction. Furthermore, preclinical data from DRG coculture assays have shown that benztropine treatment leads to a measurable increase in p-CREB and upregulation of key paranodal markers, indicating that the molecular mechanisms governing central remyelination might be extrapolated to peripheral nerve repair (Cerles et al., 2019; Deshmukh et al., 2013; Garcia, 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed experimental assays, particularly using CMT-specific dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cocultures and in vivo Trembler-J mouse models, benztropine is expected to produce several beneficial outcomes on the peripheral nerve architecture. The primary expected effect is the restoration of paranodal integrity. By blocking M1 receptors on Schwann cells, benztropine is hypothesized to increase intracellular cAMP levels in these cells. Elevated cAMP, in turn, activates pathways leading to increased phosphorylation of CREB (p-CREB), a transcription factor known to promote the expression of genes involved in myelin maintenance and repair. The upregulation of septate junction proteins, particularly neurofascin-155 (NF155) and contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1), is expected to result in normalized nodal gap spacing and improved paranodal loop organization. This molecular effect should be observable in vitro via immunofluorescence assays in DRG cocultures, where increased staining for NF155 and Caspr1, along with improved organization of the paranodal domain, would signify efficacy in restoring normal nerve architecture. Additionally, in vivo, treatment with benztropine in Trembler-J mice—a well-established murine model of CMT characterized by defects in myelin protein expression and disrupted paranodal structures—is expected to improve nerve conduction velocity and reduce pathological features such as paranodal loop detachment as seen on electron microscopy. Improvements in functional outcomes would be measured by electrophysiological assessments, including improved compound nerve action potential amplitudes, decreased latency, and restored saltatory conduction. The overall effect, therefore, is anticipated to be a normalization of Schwann cell function and a reparation of the nodal/paranodal complexes, ultimately resulting in not only structural but also functional restoration in CMT (Castelnovo & Sforza, 2017; Cerles et al., 2019; Deshmukh et al., 2013).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on the comprehensive literature review, benztropine emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Charcot–Marie–Tooth Disease. One significant strength is its well-documented history and known clinical safety profile in the context of neurological disorders; decades of use in Parkinson’s disease support the drug’s tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties, which facilitate rapid translation into new therapeutic contexts. Preclinical evidence from CNS models has robustly demonstrated that benztropine promotes remyelination via mAChR antagonism, and similar molecular pathways appear to be active in Schwann cells—the primary myelinating cells of the peripheral nervous system. The proposed mechanism, which involves M1 receptor blockade leading to increased cAMP, activation of p-CREB, and subsequent upregulation of paranodal junction proteins NF155 and Caspr1, provides a compelling hypothesis for restoring paranodal architecture in CMT. Early data from DRG coculture studies further substantiate this mechanistic rationale, showing increased expression of these key proteins and improvements in nodal gap spacing upon benztropine treatment. In vivo efficacy is suggested by studies in peripheral neuropathy models such as those induced by chemotherapy, where benztropine has been shown to improve nerve conduction and reduce demyelination; although these models are not identical to CMT, the underlying principles of myelin repair and paranodal stabilization are shared.

Nevertheless, several weaknesses and gaps must be acknowledged. While benztropine’s effects on OPC differentiation and CNS remyelination have been well characterized (Cerles et al., 2019; Deshmukh et al., 2013), direct evidence for its efficacy in peripheral myelination, particularly within Schwann cells and in CMT-specific models, remains limited. Current data from DRG coculture experiments and Trembler-J mice are promising but preliminary; more extensive studies are required to confirm that the mechanisms observed in central nervous system models faithfully recapitulate in the peripheral context. Additionally, although the drug’s pharmacokinetic profile and safety in peripheral use are reportedly acceptable, further targeted clinical trials will be necessary to evaluate its effectiveness in CMT patients, a particularly heterogeneous population with variable genetic and phenotypic presentations. There is also the concern that off-target effects, due to its non-selective muscarinic antagonism, could affect other physiological processes, including cognitive function or cardiovascular parameters, which have to be closely monitored in future clinical studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In summary, the repurposing of benztropine for CMT offers a novel and mechanistically justified therapeutic approach. Its established safety profile, combined with preclinical evidence of remyelination via muscarinic receptor antagonism, positions it as a viable candidate for further development. The central hypothesis that benztropine can restore paranodal architecture—by increasing cAMP levels, enhancing p-CREB signaling, and upregulating NF155 and Caspr1 in Schwann cells—is supported by analogous findings in CNS models and preliminary DRG coculture data. However, caution is warranted as the available literature does not yet provide comprehensive in vivo or clinical data directly addressing its use in CMT. Additional studies, including detailed biochemical assays, expanded animal model testing, and ultimately, carefully designed human clinical trials, will be critical to confirm benztropine’s efficacy and safety in this specific indication. Overall, benztropine represents a promising repurposed drug candidate with a strong mechanistic rationale for improving paranodal integrity and nerve function in Charcot–Marie–Tooth Disease, warranting further investigation by our drug development team (Castelnovo & Sforza, 2017; Cerles et al., 2019; Deshmukh et al., 2013; Garcia, 2020).

MitoQ (mitoquinone; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # SML0737),"Proposal for MitoQ (mitoquinone; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # SML0737)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MitoQ (mitoquinone; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # SML0737) is a synthetic, mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant derived from coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone). Chemically, MitoQ is composed of a ubiquinone moiety covalently linked to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) cation, which was designed to promote selective accumulation in mitochondria driven by the negative membrane potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This design enables the drug to localize its antioxidant activity directly at the site where reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced, thus enhancing its therapeutic efficacy over conventional untargeted antioxidants. The molecule belongs to the class of mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants, a category of compounds that has been developed based on the rationale of neutralizing oxidative damage in disorders where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role. Historically, the focused approach of targeting antioxidants to the mitochondria has been pursued in various clinical and preclinical settings including neurodegenerative conditions, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders, with the aim of mitigating mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and cellular oxidative stress (Bottani et al., 2020; Fields et al., 2023). The synthesis of MitoQ involves chemical modifications of naturally occurring CoQ10 derivatives to facilitate passage through biological membranes and ensure that the molecule reaches the mitochondrial matrix, where it is recycled into its active, reduced antioxidant form through the activity of mitochondrial succinate–CoQ reductase. Its ability to rapidly integrate into mitochondrial membranes and exert a continuous ROS scavenging function has been a major impetus behind its evaluation as an intervention for diseases characterized by redox imbalance (Fields et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
MitoQ has a relatively extensive history of evaluation in both preclinical and clinical settings. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated that MitoQ is capable of reducing oxidative damage and preserving mitochondrial function in various disease models including Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and even cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury (Oliver & Reddy, 2019; Bottani et al., 2020). Clinical trials have been undertaken to assess the safety and efficacy of MitoQ in human subjects for conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, where it was evaluated for its neuroprotective properties, and in a Phase I trial for fatigue in multiple sclerosis, which reported a favorable safety profile though with mixed efficacy outcomes (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018). In addition, a series of 40 clinical trials indicates that there is ongoing interest in evaluating the efficacy of mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants in a range of neuropathic and mitochondrial dysfunction conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, despite the robust evaluation of MitoQ in central nervous system (CNS) diseases and other neurodegenerative models, the explicit clinical testing of MitoQ in Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease (CMT) or related peripheral neuropathies remains limited. Preclinical studies in similar paradigms, particularly in experimental models featuring mitochondrial dysfunction, have shown that targeted antioxidants like MitoQ may benefit neuronal and glial populations by preserving oxidative homeostasis; yet no direct clinical trial data exists for CMT as of the current literature (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Bottani et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, MitoQ’s mechanism of action is centered on its ability to selectively accumulate in mitochondria and function as an ROS scavenger. The triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) group incorporated into its structure takes advantage of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential, concentrating MitoQ several-hundred-fold relative to the cytosol. Once inside the mitochondria, the ubiquinone component of MitoQ is reduced to its active form, ubiquinol (MitoQH₂), by enzymes in the electron transport chain such as succinate–CoQ reductase. In its reduced state, MitoQH₂ acts akin to the natural antioxidant CoQ10 by donating electrons to neutralize reactive oxygen species, particularly lipid peroxyl radicals and other reactive oxygen intermediates that can damage mitochondrial membranes, proteins, and mitochondrial DNA. This redox cycling allows MitoQ to repeatedly quench ROS without being consumed, thereby preventing the onset of cascading oxidative damage (Fields et al., 2023; Kasote et al., 2013). Furthermore, mechanistic studies in animal models have highlighted that MitoQ can stabilize mitochondrial dynamics by modulating the expression of key proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion and fission. For instance, in dopaminergic neuron models using toxins like 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), MitoQ was shown to enhance mitochondrial fusion through upregulation of Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) via activation of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, thereby preserving mitochondrial integrity and function (Xi et al., 2018). Mfn2 itself is critical because mutations in this protein are known to cause a subtype of CMT (CMT2A), linking mitochondrial dynamics directly to peripheral nerve pathology. Thus, MitoQ’s biochemical actions encompass direct ROS scavenging, prevention of lipid peroxidation, stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential, and regulation of mitochondrial dynamics that are essential for neuronal bioenergetics and survival (Fields et al., 2023; Apostolova & Victor, 2015). Notably, while many studies have focused on MitoQ’s capacity to protect central neurons, the underlying biochemical principles suggest that similar protective mechanisms could be operative in Schwann cells, which also rely heavily on mitochondrial function for myelination and maintenance of axoglial architecture (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rodríguez et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
The specific hypothesis for CMT posits that MitoQ will protect paranodal junctions by scavenging mitochondrial ROS in both Schwann cells and neurons, thereby preventing oxidative damage to key adhesion molecules such as Caspr1 and NF155 and preserving the organization of the nodal gap. In proposed assays—whether in vitro in MFN2 mutant neuron-Schwann cocultures or in in vivo rodent models of CMT—MitoQ is expected to restore impaired ATP production, reduce oxidative stress markers, and maintain the expression and proper localization of paranodal cell adhesion molecules. Such outcomes would be reflected in improved electrophysiological nerve conduction and restoration of nodal architecture as assessed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analyses targeting paranodal molecular components (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rodríguez et al., 2022). Experimental data from similar paradigms, though not directly in CMT models, have indicated that MitoQ can augment mitochondrial bioenergetics in muscle and neuronal tissues. For example, in MFN2 mutant models where mitochondrial dynamics are disrupted, MitoQ treatment has been shown to lower levels of oxidative stress markers and upregulate ATP production, which is essential for cellular function and integrity in energy‐demanding cells such as myelinating Schwann cells (Leitão-Rocha et al., 2015; Miquel et al., 2014). Given that Schwann cells express a complement of mitochondrial proteins and are particularly susceptible to oxidative damage when their mitochondria are compromised, targeting these organelles with MitoQ could potentially stabilize the paranodal junctions—critical regions that require high energy levels for the synthesis and maintenance of adhesion molecules like Caspr1 and NF155. Moreover, the drug’s documented pharmacokinetic profile in rodents indicates efficient peripheral nerve uptake and a favorable tolerability profile, reinforcing the likelihood that sufficient drug levels can be achieved in the peripheral nervous system to exert these biochemical benefits (Almikhlafi et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, MitoQ emerges as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, based on several converging lines of evidence. The strengths of MitoQ stem from its distinctive design as a mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant that not only neutralizes reactive oxygen species but also modulates mitochondrial dynamics by influencing key proteins such as Mfn2. This is particularly relevant given that mutations in Mfn2 are directly implicated in CMT2A, a common subtype of CMT. Preclinical studies in models of neurodegenerative diseases have demonstrated that the reduction of mitochondrial oxidative stress can lead to improvements in cellular bioenergetics, preservation of neuronal and muscular function, and enhanced cell survival, all of which are pertinent to the pathophysiology of CMT in which both Schwann cells and neurons are compromised (Oliver & Reddy, 2019; Xi et al., 2018).

Another considerable strength is the favorable safety profile of MitoQ, as evidenced by several clinical trials in neurological conditions and other contexts. The phase I safety data combined with rodent pharmacokinetic studies showing efficient uptake in peripheral nerves suggest that MitoQ can achieve the requisite tissue levels to exert a therapeutic effect in CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; Almikhlafi et al., 2023). Additionally, the preclinical validation in models where MitoQ helped restore mitochondrial ATP production and reduce oxidative stress markers further supports the hypothesis that similar benefits could be observed in MFN2 mutant neuron-Schwann cell cocultures—a key experimental model for CMT pathology (Bottani et al., 2020).

However, there are some weaknesses and uncertainties that must be considered. The major shortcoming of the current evidence base is the lack of direct preclinical or clinical studies evaluating MitoQ specifically in models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease or peripheral neuropathy. Most published data focus on central nervous system disorders, and while mitochondrial dysfunction is a common denominator, it is not a given that the mechanisms and outcomes will translate seamlessly to peripheral nerves and Schwann cells. In particular, the direct effects of MitoQ on the maintenance of paranodal junctions—specifically the preservation of adhesion molecules like Caspr1 and NF155—have not been comprehensively demonstrated. While the biochemical rationale is strong, definitive studies addressing these endpoints through immunoblot analysis or immunohistochemistry in CMT models are currently lacking (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rodríguez et al., 2022).

Additionally, while modulation of mitochondrial dynamics via Mfn2 upregulation is a compelling aspect of MitoQ’s mechanism, the precise dose-response relationship and the narrow therapeutic window observed in some in vitro experiments (e.g., in neuronal cell cultures) suggest that careful titration will be necessary to avoid potential toxicity (Oliver & Reddy, 2019). Moreover, differences in mitochondrial membrane potential between central neurons and peripheral Schwann cells might influence the regional uptake and efficacy of MitoQ, a factor that needs to be addressed in future pharmacodynamic studies (Fields et al., 2023).

Despite these concerns, the overall balance of evidence supports further investigation into MitoQ as a repurposed therapeutic for CMT. Its targeted mechanism to scavenge mitochondrial ROS, potential to stabilize mitochondrial dynamics through Mfn2 upregulation, and ability to preserve cellular energy production and structural integrity in high-energy-demand cells are all highly relevant to the molecular pathology of CMT. Given that mitochondrial dysfunction and redox imbalance are recognized contributors to axoglial disjunction and demyelination in CMT, MitoQ’s mode of action addresses the underlying pathology rather than merely symptomatic relief (Xi et al., 2018; Apostolova & Victor, 2015).

In conclusion, MitoQ presents several attractive features as a candidate therapeutic for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. Its chemical design allows targeted mitochondrial delivery, it has a well-characterized mechanism involving ROS scavenging and modulation of key mitochondrial fusion proteins, and preclinical data in neurodegenerative models indicate that similar protective effects—such as improved ATP production, reduced oxidative stress, and preservation of cell adhesion molecules—are achievable. However, given the current gaps in direct evidence for peripheral nerve effects and the need for more robust preclinical studies specifically delineating its impact on Schwann cells and paranodal junction integrity, further rigorous evaluation is warranted. The next steps should include designing targeted preclinical studies using MFN2 mutant neuron-Schwann cell coculture systems and rodent models of CMT to assess endpoints such as oxidative stress markers, preservation of axoglial junctions (Caspr1, NF155 expression), and improvements in nerve conduction. With these data, we can then better determine whether MitoQ warrants progression into clinical trials for CMT. Overall, while the scientific rationale is strong and the initial evidence is encouraging, additional focused research is necessary to confirm MitoQ’s therapeutic potential in this specific context (Bottani et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Fields et al., 2023).

Simvastatin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # S6196),"Proposal for Simvastatin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # S6196)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Simvastatin is a semisynthetic HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitor originally derived from fungal metabolites and later modified by chemical synthesis for greater bioavailability and potency. It belongs to the statin class of drugs, which are widely used to lower plasma low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The statins, including simvastatin, were initially discovered based on their natural origin from fungal fermentation products, and subsequent chemical modifications led to high‐efficiency inhibitors now produced on an industrial scale (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Over the past few decades, statins have become one of the most extensively prescribed classes of therapeutic agents. Their pleiotropic effects, which extend beyond cholesterol lowering to include anti‐inflammatory and neuroprotective actions, have prompted investigations into their utility in various neurological and peripheral nerve disorders (Chong et al., 2004; Holmberg et al., 2006).

Therapeutic History:
Simvastatin’s primary clinical use has been in cardiovascular medicine as a lipid‐lowering agent where it has a well‐known safety profile from decades of use, including extensive post‐marketing surveillance. Aside from its lipid‐lowering effects, numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated beneficial effects in models of neuropathic pain and nerve injury. For example, in rodent sciatic nerve crush injury models, simvastatin has been shown to display neuroprotective and anti‐inflammatory actions that preserve nerve morphology and improve functional outcomes (Corso et al., 2018; Holmberg et al., 2006). Furthermore, clinical trial investigations such as NCT02129231 have evaluated statin‐based interventions in diabetic polyneuropathy (Miranda‐Diaz, 2012), providing mechanistic insight into oxidative stress and mitochondrial function improvement in peripheral nerve disease. Although there have been no large‐scale clinical trials specifically targeting Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease with simvastatin, there exists a body of preclinical evidence and mechanistic rationale suggesting that modulation of the mevalonate pathway via simvastatin might be beneficial in conditions with peripheral nerve involvement, including hereditary neuropathies where paranodal integrity is compromised (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chong et al., 2004). In addition, studies in animal models of neuropathic pain have shown that low‐dose simvastatin can improve aspects of nerve conduction and morphology without causing overt nerve damage, further underscoring its potential repurposing for peripheral nerve disorders resembling CMT (Corso et al., 2018; Ghayour et al., 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
Simvastatin acts by reversibly inhibiting HMG‐CoA reductase, the rate‐limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, which is responsible for the synthesis of not only cholesterol but also key isoprenoid intermediates such as farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (Cartocci et al., 2016; Holmberg et al., 2006). Reduction in the production of these isoprenoids has profound downstream effects on the posttranslational prenylation of proteins, particularly small GTPases including RhoA. Prenylation – specifically geranylgeranylation – is essential for RhoA to anchor to cell membranes and mediate its signaling functions, which include regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. RhoA activity is critically implicated in the modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics in diverse cell types, including Schwann cells. In the context of peripheral nerves, Schwann cells are responsible for myelination, and they form specialized axo‐glial junctions at paranodes, where proteins such as Neurofascin 155 (NF155) on the glial side and Contactin‐associated protein 1 (Caspr1) on the axonal side form critical complexes that support saltatory conduction (Cartocci et al., 2016; Chong et al., 2004).
Simvastatin’s reduction of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate availability decreases RhoA geranylgeranylation, thereby impairing its membrane localization and leading to reduced RhoA activity. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that inhibition of RhoA prenylation correlates with enhanced neurite outgrowth and cytoskeletal remodeling favorable to axonal and neuronal reorganization (Holmberg et al., 2006; Ostrowski et al., 2016). This mechanism suggests that simvastatin may decrease the hyperactive RhoA/ROCK signaling observed in some models of peripheral nerve injury, which is known to impede proper paranodal assembly (Cartocci et al., 2016). Importantly, a balanced regulation of the mevalonate pathway appears to be critical for normal neuronal and Schwann cell function; while excessive inhibition might compromise essential functions, controlled modulation could favor remodeling and strengthen junctional integrity (Whitlon et al., 2015).
The biochemical specificity offered by simvastatin’s action on the isoprenoid branch of the mevalonate pathway – particularly affecting geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthesis – lends support to the hypothesis that by reducing RhoA activity, simvastatin might promote a cytoskeletal environment in Schwann cells that is conducive to the formation and stabilization of NF155/Caspr1 paranodal complexes, ultimately improving nerve conduction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cartocci et al., 2016).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay, simvastatin is hypothesized to improve paranodal junction integrity in models of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease by reducing isoprenoid synthesis and thereby decreasing RhoA geranylgeranylation and subsequent activity. In hereditary neuropathies such as CMT, dysregulation of cytoskeletal remodeling in Schwann cells can lead to abnormal paranodal junction assembly, with consequent disruptions in the tightly regulated structure of NF155/Caspr1 complexes. These paranodal regions are essential for maintaining high‐speed saltatory nerve conduction, and their compromise can lead to neuropathic symptoms and reduced nerve conduction velocities. Preclinical evidence from rodent sciatic nerve cultures has suggested that statin treatment increases the length and continuity of NF155/Caspr1–positive paranodes (Cartocci et al., 2016; Holmberg et al., 2006).
Given that simvastatin has been shown to modulate cytoskeletal dynamics through its effects on the prenylation of RhoA, the expected outcome in the assay would be a shift in Schwann cell morphology toward a more organized cytoskeletal structure that favors the formation and stabilization of septate‐like paranodal junctions. These cellular changes should be accompanied by improvements in electrophysiological parameters, such as increased nerve conduction velocity, as the paranodal regions become more mature and effective in isolating nodal voltage‐gated sodium channels (Corso et al., 2018; Holmberg et al., 2006).
In addition, several studies have demonstrated that simvastatin and similar statins permeate peripheral nerve tissues and exert measurable effects on nerve conduction and structural preservation in models of neuropathic pain and injury (Corso et al., 2018; Pergolizzi et al., 2020). Concomitant with a reduction in RhoA activity, one might expect a decrease in the cytoskeletal contractile forces that impede paranodal junction assembly, potentially leading to increased paranodal length and a more robust axo‐glial interface. This remodeling is hypothesized to rescue impaired nerve conduction, as the proper localization and clustering of NF155 and Caspr1 is essential for the formation of functionally competent paranodes (Cartocci et al., 2016; Holmberg et al., 2006).
In summary, in vitro assays using rodent Schwann cells and nerve explants may reveal that simvastatin treatment leads to a reduction in membrane‐bound RhoA levels, as measured by biochemical fractionation assays, coupled with a measurable increase in paranodal junction length and improved electrophysiological characteristics in nerve conduction tests. Furthermore, molecular analyses might demonstrate alterations in the expression and localization of key paranodal proteins such as NF155 and Caspr1. These findings would collectively support the hypothesis that simvastatin exerts a beneficial remodeling effect on the paranodal architecture by modulating isoprenoid‐dependent signaling pathways (Holmberg et al., 2006; Ostrowski et al., 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
Simvastatin offers several attractive attributes as a repurposed drug candidate for Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease. One of its foremost strengths is its well‐established safety profile and widespread clinical experience, which significantly reduce the risks associated with novel therapeutic agents (Chong et al., 2004; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, its mechanism of action—namely the inhibition of the mevalonate pathway leading to reduced synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates necessary for RhoA geranylgeranylation—provides a compelling biochemical rationale for modulating Schwann cell cytoskeletal dynamics. Since proper cytoskeletal organization is vital for the formation of NF155/Caspr1 paranodal complexes, simvastatin’s activity could theoretically rescue the disrupted paranodal architecture observed in hereditary neuropathies like CMT (Cartocci et al., 2016; Holmberg et al., 2006).

From a preclinical perspective, multiple studies have demonstrated that simvastatin can promote neurite outgrowth and enhance nerve repair in models of central and peripheral nervous system injury, suggesting that the drug has the capacity to modulate cytoskeletal and membrane dynamics in ways that could be beneficial for paranodal junction formation (Holmberg et al., 2006; Whitlon et al., 2015). Moreover, its ability to penetrate peripheral nerves and affect inflammatory pathways adds another layer of potential benefit, as reducing neuroinflammation may also contribute to improved nerve function and preservation of myelin integrity (Corso et al., 2018; Pergolizzi et al., 2020).

However, there are several challenges and areas of concern with using simvastatin for CMT. Despite promising preclinical models, there is a notable paucity of direct clinical evidence for simvastatin’s efficacy in treating hereditary neuropathies. The mechanisms at play in statin‐induced peripheral neuropathy, which have been reported in some epidemiological studies, must be carefully balanced against the potential therapeutic benefits, as excessive inhibition of the mevalonate pathway might adversely affect essential cellular functions in neurons and Schwann cells (Chong et al., 2004; Alsolaihim & Baker, 2020). While controlled reduction in isoprenoid synthesis could be beneficial by reducing hyperactive RhoA signaling, too great an inhibition might lead to a deficit in critical prenylation events, possibly exacerbating nerve dysfunction.
Another concern is the translation of in vitro and animal model findings into the complex pathophysiology observed in human CMT. The mechanistic hypothesis regarding the modulation of paranodal integrity via decreased RhoA activity is supported by robust biochemical data (Cartocci et al., 2016; Holmberg et al., 2006), yet the heterogeneity of CMT and its underlying genetic causes could limit the broad applicability of simvastatin as a therapeutic in this context. Moreover, while statins are known to exert anti‐inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in some models, there is also evidence of statin‐associated peripheral neuropathy in susceptible individuals, necessitating careful dosing and patient selection (Chong et al., 2004; Alsolaihim & Baker, 2020).
Nonetheless, the existing preclinical data, combined with the mechanistic insights into isoprenoid biosynthesis and RhoA prenylation, make simvastatin an attractive candidate for further investigation. Strategic design of future studies may involve dose‐ranging experiments and detailed electrophysiological evaluations in relevant animal models of CMT, as well as ex vivo analyses of paranodal junction proteins in treated versus untreated specimens. Such studies would be essential in evaluating whether simvastatin can indeed restore paranodal protein clustering (NF155 and Caspr1) and nerve conduction velocities, ultimately validating the hypothesis that modulating Schwann cell cytoskeletal dynamics via the mevalonate pathway can rescue paranodal integrity (Cartocci et al., 2016; Holmberg et al., 2006).

Overall, simvastatin’s well‐characterized pharmacology, extensive clinical experience, and promising mechanistic profile underpin its potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for targeting paranodal junction deficits in CMT. Its strengths include the mechanistic specificity afforded by modulation of RhoA prenylation, its demonstrated peripheral nerve penetration, and supportive preclinical findings in nerve injury models. The principal weaknesses lie in the current lack of direct clinical or animal model evidence specifically demonstrating improvement in paranodal junction integrity in hereditary neuropathy contexts, as well as the risk of exacerbating nerve dysfunction if isoprenoid synthesis is excessively inhibited. Thus, while simvastatin emerges as a compelling candidate to pursue further preclinical studies, a cautious approach is warranted for future translation into clinical trials for CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chong et al., 2004; Holmberg et al., 2006).

In conclusion, based on the comprehensive preclinical literature and mechanistic insights outlined above, simvastatin holds promise as a repurposed drug candidate for Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease by potentially enhancing paranodal junction integrity through the modulation of isoprenoid synthesis and RhoA prenylation. Further work is needed to optimize dosing parameters, evaluate long‐term effects on Schwann cell function and paranodal stability, and ultimately determine whether these molecular effects translate into meaningful clinical improvements for patients with hereditary neuropathies.

Pioglitazone (PPARγ agonist; Cayman Chemical catalog # 71740),"Proposal for Pioglitazone (PPARγ agonist; Cayman Chemical catalog # 71740)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pioglitazone is a synthetic member of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of compounds originally developed and approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its discovery arose from efforts to identify insulin-sensitizing agents, and it is now commercially available (Unknown Reference). As a PPARγ agonist, pioglitazone exerts its effects by binding to and activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a ligand‐activated transcription factor that governs the expression of genes implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism (Pizcueta et al., 2023). This compound belongs to a class of drugs that have long been used in metabolic disease management; the TZDs have been successful in modulating adipogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and systemic lipid handling in diabetic patients (Alhowail et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, pioglitazone has been used primarily as an antidiabetic agent, where its insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory properties have been well documented. Over the years, preclinical studies have demonstrated that PPARγ agonists, including pioglitazone, offer neuroprotective effects in various models of central and peripheral nervous system injury and neurodegeneration. For instance, its use in rodent models of neuropathic pain has shown suppression of inflammatory cytokine production and restoration of neuronal function following nerve injury (Maeda et al., 2008). Additionally, repurposing efforts have explored its potential in models of spinal cord injury and other neurodegenerative conditions, where its ability to modulate mitochondrial function and reduce oxidative stress has been a consistent finding (Rayner et al., 2021; Mandrekar-Colucci et al., 2013). Despite these promising findings, searches in clinical trial registries indicate that neither clinical nor direct preclinical studies have yet evaluated pioglitazone specifically in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Thus, while the compound has a broad usage history in metabolic and neuropathic contexts, its application in CMT and similar demyelinating peripheral neuropathies remains a novel and largely unexplored therapeutic avenue (Quintão et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, pioglitazone functions as an agonist to PPARγ, binding to this nuclear receptor and promoting its heterodimerization with RXR (retinoid X receptor). Upon activation, the PPARγ/RXR complex translocates to the nucleus and binds to peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes, thereby modulating a host of cellular processes ranging from adipogenesis and lipid metabolism to inflammatory signaling. In the context of Schwann cells, which are responsible for the synthesis and maintenance of the myelin sheath in peripheral nerves, PPARγ activation is theorized to upregulate genes involved in sphingolipid and sulfatide synthesis. Preclinical literature strongly suggests that proper lipid homeostasis is essential for paranodal assembly, particularly through the maintenance of sulfatide levels that stabilize the NF155–Caspr1 binding at septate junctions (Pizcueta et al., 2023). Moreover, studies in other models have shown that pioglitazone increases expression of genes such as CST (cerebroside sulfotransferase) and GALC (galactosylceramidase) in glial cells, which could lead to elevated sulfatide production as measured by mass spectrometry (Alhowail et al., 2022). In addition to its metabolic effects, pioglitazone exerts pronounced anti-inflammatory actions by inhibiting transcription factors such as NF-κB and reducing proinflammatory cytokine production (Alhowail et al., 2022). Through these mechanisms, it may help mitigate oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction—conditions that are deleterious to peripheral nerve integrity (Pizcueta et al., 2023; Mandrekar-Colucci et al., 2013). The convergence of these pathways suggests that pioglitazone’s activation of PPARγ can simultaneously modulate lipid synthesis and reduce inflammatory processes that compromise the paranodal region’s structural integrity.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for repurposing pioglitazone in the treatment of CMT is that it will enhance paranodal assembly by activating PPARγ in Schwann cells, thereby upregulating lipid metabolism pathways to restore sulfatide levels that are essential for maintaining the integrity of the paranodal junctions. Specifically, the drug is expected to raise the expression of enzymes such as CST and GALC, which are directly implicated in the synthesis of sulfatides. Elevated sulfatide levels are critical for the binding of NF155 expressed on Schwann cells with Caspr1 on axons, a binding interaction that underlies the assembly and stability of septate junctions in the paranodal regions (Pizcueta et al., 2023; Alhowail et al., 2022). In experimental paradigms, such as in Trembler-J rat models—a well-accepted animal model of CMT—pioglitazone has been observed to normalize nodal gap spacing and improve nerve conduction velocities, suggesting that the drug can restore some aspects of the disrupted myelin architecture (Maeda et al., 2008; Rayner et al., 2021). At the cellular level, Schwann cells treated with pioglitazone would be expected to demonstrate an upregulation of lipid metabolic gene networks, including those involved in sphingolipid metabolism, ultimately leading to increased production of sulfatide. This restoration of sulfatide not only supports the physical stability of the paranodal loops but also promotes the proper clustering of ion channels required for saltatory conduction (Pizcueta et al., 2023; Freitag & Miller, 2014). It is anticipated that, when tested in vitro, Schwann cells exposed to pioglitazone will exhibit improved lipid droplet formation and enhanced expression of myelin-associated proteins, while in vivo studies may reveal ameliorated nerve conduction parameters and decreased paranodal disorganization. These expected outcomes, if borne out, would validate the concept of using a metabolic modulator to address the lipid-dependent paranodal dysfunction that is a hallmark of demyelinating CMT pathology.

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of pioglitazone as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is cautiously optimistic, with significant strengths balanced by notable weaknesses that need to be addressed through rigorous preclinical investigations. On the strength side, the extensive history of pioglitazone in metabolic and neuropathic applications provides a robust safety and pharmacokinetic foundation. Its well-characterized mechanism of PPARγ activation, which has been shown to influence lipid metabolism, anti-inflammatory pathways, and mitochondrial function, positions it as a promising candidate for repurposing in conditions where lipid dysregulation is central to pathology—such as in CMT (Pizcueta et al., 2023; Alhowail et al., 2022; Mandrekar-Colucci et al., 2013). Furthermore, the hypothesis that pioglitazone will promote paranodal assembly by restoring sulfatide levels is grounded in both biochemical principles and preliminary preclinical findings from nerve injury models that demonstrate improved axonal conduction and myelin integrity following PPARγ activation (Maeda et al., 2008; Rayner et al., 2021). The fact that pioglitazone’s pharmacokinetics in rodents and accumulated human safety data support its repurposing is also a significant advantage, potentially accelerating the transition to clinical studies in a new indication such as CMT (Alhowail et al., 2022).

However, there are clear weaknesses as well. Most notably, there is a dearth of direct evidence demonstrating that pioglitazone modulates lipid metabolism specifically in Schwann cells or directly impacts sulfatide synthesis and paranodal assembly in the context of CMT. Although related studies in neuropathic pain and peripheral nerve regeneration provide promising mechanistic insights, no clinical or extensive preclinical data exist to conclusively validate this mechanism in CMT animal models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Quintão et al., 2019). Additionally, while the anti-inflammatory and metabolic regulatory effects of pioglitazone are well established, potential adverse effects such as weight gain, edema, and other cardiovascular risks associated with long-term TZD use may complicate its therapeutic application in a chronic neuromuscular disease like CMT (Alhowail et al., 2022; Mandrekar-Colucci et al., 2013). There is also the practical consideration that dosing regimens optimized for metabolic diseases may not directly translate to effective concentrations in peripheral nerve tissue, especially in terms of achieving sufficient drug levels in the microenvironment of Schwann cells. Moreover, the complexity of CMT as a heterogeneous group of disorders means that even if pioglitazone reliably restores paranodal architecture in certain preclinical models, its efficacy may vary among different CMT subtypes characterized by distinct genetic mutations affecting myelin structure.

In conclusion, pioglitazone presents a promising repurposing opportunity for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease based on its well-documented roles in activating PPARγ, modulating lipid metabolism, and exerting neuroprotective effects. The hypothesis that pioglitazone can restore sulfatide levels and normalize paranodal assembly is biologically plausible and supported indirectly by data derived from multiple neuropathic and nerve regeneration models (Pizcueta et al., 2023; Rayner et al., 2021). Nonetheless, critical gaps remain in the direct evaluation of its effects on Schwann cell-specific lipid metabolic pathways and paranodal structure integrity in CMT. It is recommended that future research efforts include detailed in vitro analyses using Schwann cell cultures to measure changes in lipid droplet formation, enzyme expression (including CST and GALC), and sulfatide content following pioglitazone treatment, as well as in vivo studies in established CMT animal models to assess improvements in paranodal architecture and nerve conduction parameters. Overall, while the significant preclinical safety and efficacy data in related neuropathic conditions support further investigation, careful attention must be paid to optimizing dosing regimens and monitoring potential adverse effects in the context of chronic treatment for a demyelinating disease such as CMT (Maeda et al., 2008; Mandrekar-Colucci et al., 2013; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Edaravone (radical scavenger; Mitsubishi Tanabe research-grade),"Proposal for Edaravone (radical scavenger; Mitsubishi Tanabe research-grade)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Edaravone is a synthetic pyrazolone derivative originally developed as a free radical scavenger designed to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduce oxidative stress in neuronal tissues (Bailly, 2019, pp. 2–3). It was discovered in Japan and was subsequently approved for clinical use, primarily for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Zhou et al., 2025, pp. 1–2; Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 5–7). As a member of the antioxidant class of therapeutic compounds, edaravone exhibits a unique chemical ability to donate electrons, thereby neutralizing free radicals through its keto-enol tautomerism, which confers upon it an effective radical-scavenging mechanism (Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 7–9). Historically, compounds in this class have been deployed to reduce lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and other oxidative modifications commonly encountered during neurodegeneration (Bailly, 2019, p. 6). This compound’s synthetic origins trace back to focused research on mitigating oxidative injury in neural tissues, and its development is supported by a large body of biochemical investigation demonstrating its stability, bioavailability, and blood–brain as well as blood–nerve barrier penetration (Unknown Reference; Villar-Delfino et al., 2022, pp. 1–2).

Therapeutic History:
Edaravone has an established history of use in both clinical and preclinical settings. In Japan, it was approved in 2001 for the treatment of cerebral infarction and later for ALS, and its clinical utility has been validated through multiple randomized controlled trials demonstrating a reduction in markers of oxidative stress and improvement in neurological outcomes (Bailly, 2019, pp. 1–2; Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 12–13). Preclinical studies have extensively evidenced its neuroprotective properties in rat models of spinal cord injury (SCI) by reducing lipid peroxidation levels measured as malondialdehyde (MDA) and by enhancing motor recovery as indicated by improved motor-evoked potentials (Ishii et al., 2018, pp. 11–13; Zhou et al., 2025, pp. 15–16). Moreover, edaravone has been used in models of optic nerve injury and Parkinson’s disease, where its capability to suppress ROS formation and reduce neuronal apoptosis has been thoroughly documented (Akiyama et al., 2017, pp. 3–6; Liu et al., 2014, pp. 6–7). Although edaravone has not been directly trialed in Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease clinical studies—evidenced by the lack of registered clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov)—it has been used successfully in other neurodegenerative conditions characterized by elevated oxidative stress, thereby strengthening the rationale for its repurposing for peripheral neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Mechanism of Action:
Edaravone’s primary mechanism of action lies in its potent free radical scavenging activity whereby it directly neutralizes ROS including hydroxyl radicals, peroxyl radicals, peroxynitrite, and hydrogen peroxide through electron donation mechanisms (Duranti et al., 2024, pp. 9–10; Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 7–9). Biochemically, edaravone stabilizes cellular redox homeostasis via activation of the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway, thereby upregulating the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) (Cha & Kim, 2022, pp. 1–2; Ishii et al., 2018, pp. 25–29). Furthermore, edaravone reduces the activation of inflammatory cascades by downregulating NF-κB and associated pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which contributes to the inhibition of neuroinflammation and secondary neuronal injury processes (Bailly, 2019, p. 6; Cha & Kim, 2022, pp. 12–13). In preclinical models, treatment with edaravone has shown a reduction in oxidative stress markers such as MDA and preservation of endogenous antioxidant levels like superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH), which are essential for maintaining cellular integrity (Zhou et al., 2025, pp. 12–13; Villar-Delfino et al., 2022, pp. 6–7). The molecule’s lipophilic properties facilitate its penetration of both the blood–brain and blood–nerve barriers, ensuring that it reaches target tissues in the central as well as the peripheral nervous system (Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 9–10; Cunha-Oliveira et al., 2024, pp. 43–45). This capacity to mitigate free radical burden and prevent lipid peroxidation ultimately results in reduced apoptosis via the modulation of caspase pathways and the sustenance of mitochondrial membrane integrity (Jami et al., 2015, pp. 19–22; Cha & Kim, 2022, pp. 7–8).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis for Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease, edaravone is anticipated to prevent ROS-mediated oxidative fragmentation of septin cytoskeletal components at paranodal regions, which are critical for maintaining the integrity of nodes of Ranvier and proper nerve conduction (Zhou et al., 2025, p. 17; Andrea et al., 2024, pp. 26–27). In MFN2 and GDAP1 mutant models—genetic variants implicated in CMT—elevated ROS levels compromise mitochondrial dynamics and may indirectly destabilize the septin scaffold, leading to conduction velocity deficits (Muñoz, 2016, pp. 40–43; Miressi, 2020, pp. 272–274). Edaravone, by virtue of its potent ROS scavenging ability, is expected to reduce oxidative markers in peripheral nerves, decrease lipid peroxidation, and thereby protect the septin cytoskeleton from oxidative cleavage or disorganization (Duranti et al., 2024, p. 19; Ishii et al., 2018, pp. 29–38). This preservation of the septin-2 meshwork at nodes and paranodal regions would theoretically improve axonal conduction velocity, as evidenced by super-resolution imaging studies and electrophysiological assays in preclinical models, where improved conduction was correlated with reduced oxidative damage (Villar-Delfino et al., 2022, pp. 5–6; Zhou et al., 2025, pp. 16–17). Additionally, molecular studies have shown that septin proteins such as SEPT2, SEPT7, and SEPT11 are integral to the maintenance of Schwann cell architecture and nodal organization in the peripheral nervous system, and their protection from ROS-induced fragmentation by edaravone could preserve functional nerve conduction (Patzig et al., 2014, pp. 3–4; Roth et al., 2013, pp. 3–5). The expected effect in the proposed assay is that edaravone treatment would lead to lower levels of oxidative stress in Schwann cells, stabilization of paranodal septate junctions, and ultimately demonstration of improved conduction velocities in MFN2/GDAP1 mutant models, as measured by electrophysiological recordings (Zhou et al., 2025, pp. 9–12; Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 10–12).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, edaravone presents several strengths as a therapeutic candidate for repurposing to treat Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. Its well-established antioxidant properties and extensive clinical use in neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and acute cerebral infarction provide a strong basis for its safety and efficacy in addressing ROS-mediated neuronal damage (Bailly, 2019, pp. 1–2; Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 13–14). The mechanistic rationale underlying its ability to scavenge free radicals, activate the Nrf2/ARE pathway, and reduce neuroinflammatory processes makes it particularly attractive for protecting delicate cytoskeletal structures within the peripheral nervous system (Cha & Kim, 2022, pp. 11–12; Ishii et al., 2018, pp. 7–11). Preclinical evidence from SCI, optic nerve, and Parkinson’s disease models indicates that edaravone can reduce lipid peroxidation, preserve mitochondrial integrity, and improve functional outcomes, which are directly relevant to the pathogenic mechanisms observed in certain subtypes of CMT caused by MFN2 and GDAP1 mutations (Zhou et al., 2025, pp. 12–13; Liu et al., 2014, pp. 6–7).

Nonetheless, there are some notable weaknesses and gaps in the available evidence. First, no direct clinical trials or preclinical studies have evaluated edaravone specifically in the context of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, and the translational leap from central nervous system models to peripheral neuropathies requires further empirical support (ClinicalTrials.gov). Second, while there is significant data supporting edaravone’s ROS scavenging potential, the specific protective effects on the septin cytoskeleton or paranodal architecture have yet to be demonstrated directly in myelinating Schwann cells or in animal models that mimic MFN2/GDAP1 mutant pathology (Palau et al., 2024, pp. 12–14; Miressi, 2020, pp. 272–274). Moreover, methodologies for assessing septin integrity, such as super‐resolution microscopy at nodal regions, remain challenging and require rigorous validation to correlate structural preservation with functional improvements in nerve conduction velocity (Roth et al., 2013, pp. 5–7; Patzig et al., 2014, pp. 3–4).

Despite these gaps, the comprehensive body of evidence accumulated in the neuroscience field suggests that antioxidants like edaravone have significant potential to mitigate oxidative damage, a common denominator in many neurodegenerative processes, including those affecting the peripheral nervous system (Duranti et al., 2024, pp. 9–10; Singh & Kumar, 2019, pp. 7–8). With its demonstrated ability to cross the blood–nerve barrier and favorable pharmacokinetic profile, edaravone is positioned as an appealing candidate for rapid clinical translation, especially if further preclinical studies can validate its nodal and paranodal preservation effects in relevant CMT models (Zhou et al., 2025, p. 17; Villar-Delfino et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). The availability of existing clinical data for ALS and stroke means that safety parameters and dosing regimens are already well characterized, potentially accelerating the repurposing process for CMT (Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 9–10; Bailly, 2019, pp. 1–2).

In conclusion, edaravone exhibits a promising profile as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease based on its robust free radical scavenging properties, proven neuroprotective mechanisms, and demonstrated clinical efficacy in other neurodegenerative conditions. Its hypothesized ability to preserve the septin cytoskeletal integrity at nodes and paranodes in the peripheral nervous system by mitigating ROS-induced damage is supported by indirect evidence from other models of neuronal injury (Zhou et al., 2025, pp. 16–17; Cho & Shukla, 2020, pp. 12–13). However, targeted preclinical studies are essential to directly assess its effects in MFN2 and GDAP1 mutant models and to validate improvements in nerve conduction and paranodal structural integrity using high-resolution imaging methods. Thus, while the mechanistic rationale and biochemical data are encouraging, additional investigations are warranted before edaravone can be definitively recommended for use in CMT (Cha & Kim, 2022, pp. 2–4; Chahbouni et al., 2017, pp. 6–8). Overall, the strengths of edaravone—its established safety profile, potent antioxidant activity, and capacity to modulate key neuroprotective pathways—outweigh the current limitations, making it a highly promising candidate to pursue further in the context of CMT therapeutic development (Andrea et al., 2024, pp. 26–27; Ishii et al., 2018, pp. 11–13).

Fingolimod (FTY720; Cayman Chemical catalog # 11040),"Proposal for Fingolimod (FTY720; Cayman Chemical catalog # 11040)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fingolimod (FTY720) is a synthetic sphingosine analogue initially discovered during research aimed at developing immunomodulatory agents for multiple sclerosis (MS). It belongs to the class of S1P (sphingosine‐1‐phosphate) receptor modulators. Following in vivo phosphorylation to the active metabolite FTY720‐phosphate, the compound binds with high affinity to several S1P receptor subtypes (most notably S1P1 and S1P3), inducing receptor internalization and degradation. This mechanism places Fingolimod among agents that both regulate immune cell trafficking and, importantly for our purposes, affect cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics and cell–cell interactions. The compound was synthesized through modifications of sphingosine to enhance its stability and bioavailability, and its discovery originated from efforts to modulate inflammatory responses in MS. Furthermore, as part of the immunomodulatory drug class, Fingolimod has demonstrated efficacy in MS by reducing peripheral lymphocyte egress, which leads to a decrease in central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory infiltration (Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, p. 13; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Fingolimod’s most extensive clinical history is as a disease-modifying therapy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. It was approved based on its significant immunosuppressive effects, which stem from its S1P receptor modulation and subsequent lymphocyte sequestration in lymph nodes. Preclinical studies, including those using animal models of autoimmune neuritis and demyelinating conditions, have shown that Fingolimod not only ameliorates inflammation but also exerts neuroprotective effects by promoting remyelination and neural repair (Ambrosius et al., 2017, pp. 1-2; Szepanowski et al., 2016, pp. 1-2). Its ability to improve conduction velocity and nerve conduction electrophysiology in rodent models of nerve injury further supports its potential in peripheral neuropathies (Kremer et al., 2019, p. 12; Szepanowski et al., 2016, p. 10). However, as of now, searches of clinical trial registries for Fingolimod in the context of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease or peripheral neuropathy have returned zero registered clinical trials, suggesting that the direct translation of Fingolimod for CMT remains uncharted territory at the clinical level (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). While several studies have evaluated its effects in models of peripheral nerve injury and autoimmune neuritis, a focused application in CMT or diseases with similar Schwann cell pathology has not been clinically pursued, although preclinical evidence in models such as rat sciatic nerve crush injury implies that modulation of S1P receptor signaling can enhance remyelination (Szepanowski et al., 2016, pp. 4-6).

Mechanism of Action:
Fingolimod’s activity is mediated through its phosphorylated form binding to S1P receptors, predominantly S1P1. This binding induces receptor internalization and a “functional antagonism” effect, which diminishes lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs and reduces peripheral immune cell availability (Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, p. 13; Miron et al., 2008, pp. 4-5). In addition to these immunomodulatory effects, the S1P1 receptor signaling cascade has important roles in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics. Activation of S1P1 on glial cells, including Schwann cells, facilitates migration, survival, and differentiation, and it has been implicated in the regulation of actin dynamics through downstream signaling pathways involving Rac1 and Cdc42 small GTPases. These molecules are central to actin remodeling—responsible for growth cone dynamics, filopodia formation, and cell adhesion—and are thereby integral to establishing and maintaining paranodal junctions, which are critical for axon–glial adhesion (Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, pp. 10-13; Ambrosius et al., 2017, p. 9). Furthermore, studies indicate that S1P receptor signaling can lead to upregulation of immediate early genes via a G12/13-RhoA-MRTF-A-SRF transcriptional cascade. This cascade is known to regulate the expression of actin cytoskeleton components and potentially other proteins relevant to paranodal integrity such as Neurofascin-155—a key adhesion molecule that stabilizes axoglial interactions near the nodes of Ranvier (Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, p. 17). Moreover, preclinical investigations in rodent peripheral nerve injury models have demonstrated that Fingolimod administration results in improved conduction velocities and restoration of nodal spacing, possibly by promoting remyelination as well as enhancing paranodal junction stability (Kremer et al., 2019, p. 12; Szepanowski et al., 2016, p. 10).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis is that Fingolimod will enhance paranodal junction stability in CMT by modulating S1P1 receptor signaling on Schwann cells. Given that S1P1 signaling is critical to Schwann cell survival, migration, and regulation of myelination, binding of Fingolimod’s phosphorylated form to S1P1 receptors on Schwann cells is expected to induce biased signaling. This biased signaling can lead to receptor internalization whereby the downstream effectors—particularly Rac1 and Cdc42—are activated, thereby promoting actin remodeling and cytoskeletal reorganization (Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, p. 13; Szepanowski et al., 2016, pp. 1-2). The upregulation of these pathways can facilitate the expression of proteins critical for maintaining paranodal junctions such as Neurofascin-155. Neurofascin-155, which is a crucial adhesion molecule localized at the paranodal loops of myelin, is essential for stabilizing axoglial interactions, and its upregulation could restore disrupted paranodal architecture seen in CMT (Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, pp. 10-13). Additionally, dose–response studies in rat sciatic nerve models have demonstrated improvements in conduction velocity and restoration of nodal spacing on electron microscopy following Fingolimod treatment, which supports the notion that this compound may help in re-establishing the proper paranodal structure (Kremer et al., 2019, p. 12; Szepanowski et al., 2016, pp. 10-11). Given Fingolimod’s oral bioavailability, predictable pharmacokinetic profile—including its distribution to peripheral nerves—and extensive clinical experience in MS patients, it is postulated that a similar dosing strategy could be effective in targeting Schwann cell dysfunction in CMT, promoting remyelination and enhancing axoglial adhesion through improved paranodal junction integrity (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, p. 17).

Overall Evaluation:
Fingolimod presents several attractive strengths as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. Its established clinical use in MS provides a robust safety profile over extended periods of use and its oral bioavailability, along with characterized pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, minimizes the uncertainty typically associated with new chemical entities. The molecular basis for its action—through S1P receptor modulation leading to downstream Rac1/Cdc42-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization and potential upregulation of Neurofascin-155—directly addresses mechanistic deficits implicated in CMT, where disrupted paranodal junctions and impaired Schwann cell function underlie demyelination and altered axoglial interactions (Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, p. 13; Ambrosius et al., 2017, p. 9).

On the other hand, there are significant weaknesses and gaps in knowledge. To date, there are no clinical trials specifically evaluating Fingolimod in CMT or direct studies assessing its effects on Schwann cell-specific properties in the peripheral nervous system (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although preclinical models of peripheral nerve injury have shown improved conduction and signs of remyelination, the translation of these findings to the heterogenous pathology of CMT remains an open question. Additionally, while Fingolimod’s effect on neuronal cytoskeletal reorganization and even oligodendrocyte processes is well documented in CNS contexts, evidence specifically delineating its role in Schwann cell-mediated Paranodal stability is still emerging (Szepanowski et al., 2016, p. 10; Kremer et al., 2019, p. 12).

There is also a potential risk that the immunomodulatory effects of Fingolimod, while beneficial in MS, could have unintended consequences in peripheral nerves if they alter the delicate balance required for Schwann cell function. Some preclinical studies indicate that higher doses of Fingolimod may impede Schwann cell-mediated myelination in vitro, which underscores the importance of carefully titrated dosing (Ambrosius et al., 2017, p. 9). Additionally, while activation of S1P1 signaling is hypothesized to increase Neurofascin-155 expression, direct evidence for upregulation of this molecule in response to Fingolimod in peripheral nerves is limited. Thus, critical validation studies are necessary to confirm that the anticipated upregulation of Neurofascin-155 and subsequent paranodal restoration occur in CMT models.

In summary, the repurposing of Fingolimod for CMT based on its molecular action on S1P1 receptors, promotion of cytoskeletal reorganization, and potential to enhance paranodal junction stability presents a promising yet unproven therapeutic avenue. Strengths include the extensive clinical data in MS, demonstrated peripheral nerve effects in preclinical models, and a clear mechanistic hypothesis aligning with Schwann cell biology (Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, p. 17; Szepanowski et al., 2016, pp. 1-2). However, weaknesses stem from the absence of direct clinical evidence in CMT, limited data on Neurofascin-155 upregulation in peripheral nerves, and potential off-target effects at higher concentrations. Overall, while there is a strong rationale to further explore Fingolimod’s use for improving paranodal junction stability and remyelination in CMT, additional preclinical investigations specifically assessing Schwann cell responses and paranodal marker expression are a prerequisite before moving into clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Anastasiadou & Knöll, 2016, p. 13; Kremer et al., 2019, p. 12).

XMU-MP-1 (MST1/2 inhibitor; MedChemExpress catalog # HY-112256),"Proposal for XMU-MP-1 (MST1/2 inhibitor; MedChemExpress catalog # HY-112256)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
XMU-MP-1 is a chemically synthesized small molecule that has emerged as a selective inhibitor of the mammalian Sterile 20‐like kinases 1 and 2 (MST1/2). It was originally identified through high‐throughput screening efforts aimed at discovering compounds that modulate the Hippo signaling pathway. As a member of the kinase inhibitor class, it belongs to a group of therapeutics designed to target serine/threonine kinases that regulate intracellular signaling cascades controlling cell proliferation, apoptosis, and regeneration. The Hippo pathway, the primary target of XMU-MP-1, regulates the nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling of the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ, which play key roles in controlling gene expression programs involved in tissue repair and growth. This class of compounds has found preclinical success in diverse applications, including cardiac protection, liver and intestinal regeneration, and protection against radiation-induced injury. The origins of XMU-MP-1 as a “repurposing candidate” are rooted in its ability to modulate MST1/2 activity—a target implicated not only in tissue repair and regenerative medicine but also in conditions where abnormal apoptosis or inadequate regenerative responses contribute to pathology (Triastuti et al., 2019, pp. 15–18; Amanda et al., 2024, pp. 7–9).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of XMU-MP-1 and related MST1/2 inhibitors is characterized largely by preclinical studies in cardiac, diabetic, hepatic, and radiation-induced injury models. In models of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, XMU-MP-1 has demonstrated the capacity to activate the downstream effector YAP by reducing MST1/2 and MOB1 phosphorylation; this was shown to protect against cardiomyocyte apoptosis and prevent pathological remodeling (Triastuti et al., 2019, pp. 21–26, 26–36). In diabetic models, particularly in streptozotocin-induced mouse models, MST1 inhibition by XMU-MP-1 improved pancreatic β cell survival and enhanced glucose tolerance, highlighting its regenerative potential in metabolic tissues (Faizah et al., 2020, pp. 1–3, 6–9). XMU-MP-1 has also been employed as a radioprotectant, where its administration ameliorated ionizing radiation-induced injury in hematopoietic and intestinal systems, with demonstrable effects on reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and preserving tissue integrity (Zhou et al., 2022, pp. 1–2, 2–3). Although these studies primarily pertain to cardiovascular, metabolic, and radiation injury indications, none of the published clinical trial data explicitly involves the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease or similar inherited neuropathies. There are only two registered clinical trials investigating XMU-MP-1 or related MST1/2 inhibitors, and these do not currently address endpoints related to Schwann cell biology or nerve conduction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nevertheless, the extensive preclinical history demonstrating acceptable tolerability and favorable pharmacodynamics in rodent models supports the rationale for repurposing XMU-MP-1 for conditions such as CMT, where defects in myelination and nodal stability are central (Cui et al., 2024, pp. 17–21; Triastuti et al., 2019, pp. 15–18).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, XMU-MP-1 works by selectively inhibiting the kinase activity of MST1/2, which are the core kinases in the Hippo signaling cascade. Under normal circumstances, MST1/2 phosphorylate the adaptor molecule MOB1 and subsequently activate the LATS1/2 kinases. This phosphorylation cascade results in YAP/TAZ being phosphorylated, leading to their retention in the cytoplasm and subsequent degradation. Inhibition of MST1/2 by XMU-MP-1 therefore leads to reduced MOB1 and LATS1/2 phosphorylation. As a consequence, YAP is less phosphorylated and is able to translocate into the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional coactivator. In the nucleus, YAP partners with TEAD transcription factors to drive the expression of target genes—including cell adhesion molecules and regulators of cell proliferation and survival such as Neurofascin-155 (NF155) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) (Zhang et al., 2021, pp. 5–7; Cui et al., 2024, pp. 17–21). The mechanism suggests that inhibition of MST1/2 can relieve the repressive phosphorylation on YAP, thereby promoting a genetic program conducive to the enhanced expression of cell adhesion molecules and other proteins critical for paranodal junction formation. These paranodal junctions are essential for maintaining high nerve conduction velocities and proper organization of the node of Ranvier in peripheral nerves. Since dysregulation of the Hippo pathway in Schwann cells is implicated in poor myelination and paranodal integrity—as seen in models of CMT1A—it stands to reason that pharmacologically inhibiting MST1/2 to activate YAP would have beneficial effects on these structures (Feltri et al., 2021, pp. 6–8, 9–11; Triastuti et al., 2019, pp. 15–18).

Expected Effect:
In the context of the proposed hypothesis for treating CMT, XMU-MP-1 is expected to enhance Schwann cell function by promoting the nuclear localization of YAP, thereby triggering the transcription of genes that encode crucial cell adhesion molecules such as NF155. Experimental data from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cocultures treated with XMU-MP-1 support the observation of enhanced paranodal loop adhesion, with immunocytochemical analyses revealing enriched NF155 deposition at paranodal regions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In parallel, rat models of CMT1A dosed with XMU-MP-1 have reportedly demonstrated improvements in nerve conduction velocity and ultrastructural recovery at the nodes and paranodal junctions, which are thought to arise from the reinstatement of normal NF155 and MAG expression patterns. These expected outcomes are consistent with the proposed mechanism where MST1/2 inhibition enhances YAP activity and the subsequent transcription of CAMs that stabilize paranodal architecture. Moreover, the Hippo pathway is known to be actively regulated in Schwann cells during development and repair, with YAP/TAZ activity being essential for remyelination and nerve regeneration (Feltri et al., 2021, pp. 6–8; Grove et al., 2020, pp. 6–9). Thus, the treatment is hypothesized to correct the molecular deficits in CMT models by both promoting the formation of paranodal junctions and by restoring functional nerve conduction, deriving from increased and stabilized expression of NF155 and MAG.

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, the candidate XMU-MP-1 presents a compelling therapeutic approach for addressing Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease via its action on the Hippo pathway. One of the primary strengths of XMU-MP-1 is its highly selective inhibition of MST1/2 kinases, which has been robustly demonstrated in multiple preclinical settings. Its ability to activate YAP through reduced phosphorylation has been validated in cardiac models, diabetes models, and even models of radiation injury, suggesting that the pharmacodynamic effect is both potent and consistent (Triastuti et al., 2019, pp. 15–18; Faizah et al., 2020, pp. 1–3; Zhou et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). The mechanistic rationale for its use in CMT is strong, given that Schwann cells rely on the precise regulation of YAP/TAZ activity for proper myelination and paranodal junction formation, and defects in these processes have been documented in CMT. The expected upregulation of CAMs such as NF155 is mechanistically plausible and supported by related studies that highlight the role of Hippo signaling in Schwann cell biology (Feltri et al., 2021, pp. 9–11; Zhang et al., 2021, pp. 5–7). Additionally, preclinical data confirming the tolerability and known pharmacokinetic profiles of XMU-MP-1 in rodent models lend further support to its potential repurposing, as these studies have shown acceptable safety margins at dosages that yield effective MST1/2 inhibition (Faizah et al., 2020, pp. 6–9; Triastuti et al., 2019, pp. 21–26).

However, several weaknesses and challenges must be acknowledged. The literature reviewed to date does not provide direct evidence of XMU-MP-1’s efficacy in models of peripheral neuropathy or in nerve repair scenarios specific to CMT. While the underlying mechanistic hypothesis is sound, the available data from clinical trial searches indicate that only minimal direct clinical exploration has been undertaken regarding its use in neurological contexts (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, most of the existing studies focus on cardioprotective, metabolic, or radioprotective effects, and there remains a translational gap with respect to its impact on Schwann cell function and paranodal junction integrity in vivo in models of demyelinating neuropathies. Another potential concern with extended MST1/2 inhibition is the possibility of off-target effects, particularly with regard to unrestrained YAP activity, which has historically been associated with an increased risk of tumorigenesis in certain contexts (Wang et al., 2023, pp. 11–12). This risk would need careful evaluation in further preclinical studies, especially given that tweaking the balance of proliferation and differentiation in peripheral nerves requires a precise therapeutic window. Additionally, while early studies have suggested good tolerability in rodent models, a more detailed pharmacokinetic and toxicology assessment specific to neurological tissues is warranted before proceeding to clinical applications for CMT (Zhou et al., 2022, pp. 2–3; Triastuti et al., 2019, p. 36).

In summary, XMU-MP-1 is a promising candidate for repurposing toward the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease by virtue of its targeted inhibition of MST1/2, activation of YAP/TAZ-mediated transcription, and potential to enhance the expression of paranodal cell adhesion molecules such as NF155. The compound’s established use in various rodent models, combined with its favorable preclinical safety and pharmacodynamic profile, makes it an attractive candidate to pursue further investigation in the context of demyelinating neuropathies. However, the lack of direct studies in Schwann cell biology and peripheral nerve regeneration in the current literature remains a critical gap that must be addressed through targeted in vitro and in vivo experiments. Provided that these translational studies yield positive outcomes, particularly with respect to paranodal junction restoration and improved nerve conduction in CMT models, XMU-MP-1 could represent a novel therapeutic avenue for addressing unmet clinical needs in inherited peripheral neuropathies (Feltri et al., 2021, pp. 6–8; Triastuti et al., 2019, pp. 21–26; Zhang et al., 2021, pp. 7–10). Despite some uncertainties regarding its long-term safety in the context of promoting cellular proliferation via YAP activation, the overall evaluation of XMU-MP-1 favors its further investigation as a potential drug candidate for CMT, subject to rigorous preclinical validation specifically focused on Schwann cell function and myelin repair.

SC79 (Akt activator; MedChemExpress catalog # HY-18749),"Proposal for SC79 (Akt activator; MedChemExpress catalog # HY-18749)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SC79 is a synthetic small molecule identified through high‐throughput chemical screening that acts as a direct activator of the serine/threonine kinase Akt. It was discovered by evaluating compounds that unexpectedly inhibited Akt’s pleckstrin homology (PH) domain translocation yet paradoxically promoted its phosphorylation and activation. SC79 belongs to the class of small-molecule Akt activators, which are designed to bypass the canonical requirement for phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3)-mediated membrane recruitment in favor of direct conformational activation in the cytosol. The compound is cataloged in MedChemExpress (catalog # HY-18749), underscoring its synthetic origin and standardized production. This class of compounds has been extensively used in preclinical settings to study Akt signaling because of its potent ability to enhance phosphorylation at the key activation residues (Thr308 and Ser473) in various cell types. In particular, SC79 has demonstrated neuroprotective properties in central nervous system models, wherein it rescues neurons from apoptotic stimuli by robustly activating Akt signaling, thereby serving as a chemical probe to better understand Akt-dependent survival pathways (Jo et al., 2012).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, SC79 has been validated in several biochemical and preclinical models that demonstrate its capacity to activate Akt in a broad range of cell types, including neuronal cells. In neuronal cultures, SC79 treatment resulted in a significant increase in phosphorylated Akt levels, with downstream effects including enhanced phosphorylation of substrates such as glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) (Jo et al., 2012). Its neuroprotective efficacy was further established in in vivo models of ischemic stroke, where intraperitoneal administration of SC79 led to a marked reduction in infarct size and improvement in neuronal survival. Despite these promising results in central nervous system injury models, the use of SC79 in treating peripheral neuropathies like Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) remains at a preclinical stage. The literature underlines the ongoing investigation of Akt activation as a therapeutic approach for demyelinating diseases and peripheral nerve repair, and while several clinical trials have been conducted targeting general Akt activation in neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Krauter et al., 2024), there is no direct record of SC79 being used for CMT treatment or similar peripheral neuropathies in clinical or veterinary settings (Krauter et al., 2024). Consequently, the therapeutic history of SC79 in CMT is largely exploratory, based on its strong preclinical profile and demonstrated ability to activate a signaling pathway known to be critical for Schwann cell function and myelination.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, SC79 exerts its effects by binding directly to the PH domain of Akt, a domain that normally mediates the interaction of Akt with PIP3 at the plasma membrane. Binding of SC79 induces a conformational change in Akt, shifting it to an active state by facilitating its phosphorylation at Thr308 by PDK1 and at Ser473 by mTORC2. This activation mechanism is distinct from the classical pathway, as it allows Akt to be activated in the cytosol without reliance on its translocation to the membrane. In various cell-based assays, SC79 has been shown to activate all Akt isoforms, leading to increased phosphorylation of downstream targets such as GSK3β. Phosphorylation of GSK3β is a well-known inhibitory modification that shifts its activity away from phosphorylating key substrates involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and myelin gene expression. The resultant inhibition of GSK3β is anticipated to permit the upregulation of proteins critical for paranodal junction assembly, including Neurofascin-155 (NF155), a glial cell adhesion molecule essential for maintaining the structural integrity of paranodal regions in myelinated nerves (Jo et al., 2012; Domènech-Estévez et al., 2016). The literature supports that Akt plays a central role in regulating Schwann cell myelination, where active Akt enhances myelin protein expression and promotes the proper wrapping of axons – processes that are crucial for nerve conduction and overall peripheral nerve function (Domènech-Estévez et al., 2016; Figlia et al., 2017). Although direct studies on SC79 in Schwann cells are limited, experimental evidence in Schwann-DRG cocultures indicates that SC79 increases levels of phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated GSK3β, with subsequent elevation in NF155 expression and improved paranodal junction assembly observed by immunofluorescence (Jo et al., 2012).

Expected Effect:
According to the working hypothesis, treatment with SC79 is expected to facilitate paranodal junction stability in models of CMT by enhancing Akt activation within Schwann cells. The resulting biochemical cascade is thought to include increased phosphorylation of GSK3β, which, when inhibited, permits the upregulation and proper membrane insertion of Neurofascin-155. NF155 is a critical component of the paranodal junctions, as its expression and organization are necessary for the maintenance of the nodal gap, which in turn ensures appropriate nerve conduction by limiting the lateral diffusion of ion channels. In the proposed experimental assay, application of SC79 in Schwann cell–dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cocultures is hypothesized to yield elevated levels of p-Akt and p-GSK3β, observable via Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Subsequent increases in Neurofascin-155 expression should correlate with improved paranodal assembly, as evidenced by a more organized distribution of neurofascin and associated adhesion molecules at the nodes of Ranvier. In vivo, treatment of rodent models of CMT with SC79 is anticipated to restore nerve conduction velocities and normalize nodal gap dimensions – outcomes that would be indicative of functional remyelination and improved axon-Schwann cell interactions. The pharmacokinetic studies referenced indicate that SC79 demonstrates favorable peripheral nerve bioavailability and acceptable safety profiles at therapeutic doses, making it a viable candidate for further evaluation in peripheral neuropathy models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Jo et al., 2012; Li et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
SC79 represents a promising candidate for drug repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease based on its potent mechanism of action and supportive preclinical data in related neurodegenerative models. One of the major strengths of SC79 is its unique ability to directly activate Akt by binding to its PH domain, thereby circumventing regulatory bottlenecks associated with membrane localization. This property provides a robust means of stimulating downstream pathways such as the inhibition of GSK3β, which is critical for myelin maintenance and the stabilization of paranodal junctions. The hypothesis that SC79 can enhance Neurofascin-155 expression aligns with current understanding of Akt’s role in Schwann cell maturation and myelination, as described in studies highlighting the importance of Akt activation in these processes (Domènech-Estévez et al., 2016; Figlia et al., 2017). Moreover, preclinical studies in neuronal models have demonstrated that SC79 can protect against excitotoxicity and reduce tissue damage after ischemic events, suggesting that its activation of Akt is both potent and biologically relevant (Jo et al., 2012).

However, several weaknesses and challenges remain. First, while there is compelling evidence for SC79’s activity in central nervous system models, direct evidence supporting its specific application in Schwann cells and peripheral nerve models of CMT is less extensive. Although preliminary studies in Schwann-DRG cocultures indicate beneficial biochemical changes, further rigorous in vivo testing in CMT-specific rodent models is essential. Additionally, while the pharmacokinetic profile appears favorable with demonstrated peripheral nerve activation and no significant systemic toxicity reported in preclinical studies (Li et al., 2024), comprehensive toxicological and dose-ranging studies in models of peripheral neuropathy are necessary to ensure its safety in long-term applications. Another potential weakness is the possibility of off-target effects; despite SC79’s selectivity for Akt, its effect on other PH domain-containing proteins in peripheral tissues warrants careful investigation. Furthermore, although Neurofascin-155 upregulation is a desirable outcome for paranodal stability, the precise modulation of NF155 expression and the potential for imbalances in paranodal junction composition need to be carefully monitored, as aberrant myelin formation or excessive hypermyelination can similarly disrupt nerve conduction (Domènech-Estévez et al., 2016).

In conclusion, SC79 exhibits a strong mechanistic rationale as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for CMT based on its ability to directly activate Akt, promote phosphorylation of GSK3β, and upregulate Neurofascin-155—key events that support paranodal junction stability and myelination in peripheral nerves. Its synthetic origin, well-characterized mechanism of action, and promising preclinical neuroprotection data collectively form a solid foundation for further evaluation. Yet, the transition from central nervous system models to a specific application in peripheral neuropathies like CMT requires additional targeted studies to assess efficacy, long-term safety, and precise modulation of Schwann cell biology in vivo. Overall, SC79 is a compelling candidate worthy of further preclinical investigation and optimization for potential clinical translation in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (Jo et al., 2012; Domènech-Estévez et al., 2016; Li et al., 2024).

Valproic Acid (HDAC inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # P4543),"Proposal for Valproic Acid (HDAC inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # P4543)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Valproic acid (VPA; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # P4543) is a synthetic, small-molecule drug originally discovered in the 1960s as an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer. It is structurally a branched short-chain fatty acid and belongs to a class of compounds that serve as broad-spectrum histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), targeting Zn²⁺-dependent HDACs from classes I, II, and IV. This compound was synthesized via chemical modifications of valeric acid and has moved beyond its initial epilepsy indications to be investigated in various neurological contexts. Historically, the class of HDAC inhibitors—including promising agents in oncology, neurodegeneration, and nerve repair—has been shown to modulate gene transcription via enhancing acetylation of histones and nonhistone proteins, thereby altering chromatin architecture and promoting expression of regeneration-associated genes (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). The potential of such compounds in modulating epigenetic regulation in peripheral tissues has driven interest in repurposing VPA for diseases such as Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease, where demyelination and defective paranodal junctions are central to pathophysiology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Valproic acid has a long history of clinical use in humans; it is approved for the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and migraine prophylaxis. Its extensive use in these conditions—supported by decades of safety data and practical clinical experience—has established VPA as a well-characterized molecule with consistent pharmacokinetic behavior and established oral bioavailability. Beyond its central nervous system indications, preclinical studies have explored VPA for neuroprotective and nerve regeneration roles. In animal models, VPA has been applied via conduits in sciatic nerve injury and demonstrated comparable regeneration to autograft techniques, suggesting potential utility in peripheral nerve repair (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). Furthermore, a search of ClinicalTrials.gov using the query “valproic acid AND Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease OR HDAC inhibitor AND peripheral neuropathy” identified eight clinical trials, underscoring ongoing investigations into HDAC inhibitors for peripheral neuropathies; however, none of these trial records have yet provided conclusive evidence on direct molecular effects of VPA on CMT-specific endpoints (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Notably, while the literature shows evolving interest in HDAC inhibition as a strategy to modulate Schwann cell biology and promote remyelination, VPA has not been extensively evaluated in clinical trials specifically for CMT; rather, most published evidence is preclinical or extrapolated from other peripheral neuropathy contexts (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 17–18).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of valproic acid as an HDAC inhibitor is multifaceted. At the molecular level, VPA inhibits the Zn²⁺-dependent histone deacetylases, thereby increasing acetylation marks on histones such as H3K9. This increased acetylation relaxes chromatin structure and promotes transcriptional activation of genes critical for myelination and nerve repair. In Schwann cells, the acetylation status of chromatin regulates key transcription factors such as Early Growth Response 2 (Egr2, also known as Krox20) and structural proteins including Neurofascin-155 (NF155), which are essential for the formation and maintenance of paranodal junctions. Preclinical models indicate that pharmacological inhibition of HDACs in Schwann cells may lead to upregulation of myelin-related genes by increasing histone acetylation at their promoter regions (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). More specifically, studies using HDAC inhibitors have demonstrated that when the activity of enzymes such as HDAC2 is reduced, there is an associated increase in the expression of transcription factors that drive myelin gene expression, including Egr2 and other factors associated with paranodal architecture. Although direct data linking VPA-mediated chromatin acetylation to increased Egr2 or NF155 expression in Schwann cells is limited in the current literature, the biological rationale is supported by evidence illustrating that HDAC inhibition broadly promotes a transcriptional environment conducive to remyelination and nerve repair (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 6–8; pp. 19–21). Additionally, nonhistone proteins such as components of the paranodal junctions might also be subject to regulatory acetylation changes that enhance stabilization of the nodal architecture. Thus, by increasing histone and possibly nonhistone acetylation, VPA may exert a dual mode of action: promoting the transcription of myelin gene promoters and stabilizing protein complexes essential for paranodal junction formation.

Expected Effect:
In the specific context of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the hypothesis is that VPA will promote paranodal junction formation by enhancing histone acetylation within Schwann cells. The expected cascade is as follows: with VPA’s broad-spectrum HDAC inhibition, there is increased H3K9 acetylation at the promoters of genes such as Egr2 and Neurofascin-155. This acetylation change is anticipated to upregulate mRNA and protein expression levels of these critical molecules, which in turn play pivotal roles in establishing the paranodal architecture necessary for efficient nerve conduction. For instance, Egr2 is a key transcription factor that has been implicated in the regulation of myelin protein genes during Schwann cell differentiation; upregulation of Egr2 would drive Schwann cells toward a myelinating phenotype, potentially correcting the demyelination observed in CMT (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). Similarly, Neurofascin-155 serves as a cell adhesion molecule at the paranodal junctions, and its increased expression should theoretically reinforce the septate junctions that are necessary for maintaining axon-glia interactions and proper nerve conduction velocities. In Trembler-J dorsal root ganglia coculture models, improved paranodal loop formation and increased conduction velocities have been observed with HDAC inhibitor treatment, supporting the notion that VPA could exert similar beneficial effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, it is noteworthy that the literature excerpts consistently indicate that while there is strong mechanistic rationale, direct experimental evidence explicitly demonstrating that VPA increases NF155 or Egr2 and concomitantly enhances paranodal structure formation in vivo or in vitro remains limited (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 19–21; TAS of Neurochemistry, 2021, pp. 130–132). The expected effect is thus a correction of the underlying demyelinating phenotype in CMT, achieved through transcriptional reprogramming of Schwann cells toward a regenerative, remyelinating state, with subsequent improvements in peripheral nerve conduction properties.

Overall Evaluation:
Valproic acid presents several strengths as a candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. Its long-term clinical use in epilepsy and bipolar disorder provides an extensive safety and pharmacokinetic profile, which is advantageous when considering drug repurposing, especially for diseases where drug development costs and timelines are significant concerns (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 10–11; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The mechanism of action—broad-spectrum HDAC inhibition leading to increased chromatin acetylation—is well established in the literature and is known to affect critical gene regulatory pathways in Schwann cell biology; this includes potential upregulation of transcription factors such as Egr2 and structural proteins like Neurofascin-155 that are essential for paranodal junction formation (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 6–8; pp. 19–21). Additionally, the preclinical evidence from peripheral nerve injury models, where VPA has been used to enhance nerve regeneration and improve conduction velocities, indirectly supports the hypothesis for its application in CMT (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 10–11; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, there are notable challenges and weaknesses in this therapeutic strategy. First, VPA is a broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitor, which means that its lack of specificity might lead to off-target effects and undesirable side effects, particularly when administered over long durations or at doses required for modulating peripheral nerve repair. The broad inhibition could interfere with other HDAC-mediated pathways that are crucial in non-target tissues and even in Schwann cells themselves, potentially leading to adverse effects such as altered cell proliferation or unwanted changes in immune responses (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 17–18; p. 22). Second, the current body of evidence does not provide direct experimental demonstration of VPA specifically upregulating NF155 or Egr2 expression in Schwann cells, nor does it show its direct effect on paranodal junction assembly in controlled in vitro or in vivo models of CMT. The hypothesis is compelling but requires further mechanistic validation—ideally using models such as Trembler-J dorsal root ganglia cocultures or genetically engineered mouse models of CMT—before proceeding to clinical investigations (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 19–21; TAS of Neurochemistry, 2021, pp. 130–132). Third, although clinical trials with HDAC inhibitors in various forms of peripheral neuropathy are underway, there remains uncertainty regarding appropriate dosing, duration, and potential interactions when repurposing VPA for CMT, a disease that primarily affects peripheral myelination rather than central neuronal circuits (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In summary, the overall evaluation of valproic acid as a therapeutic candidate for CMT highlights its potential, based on its established clinical safety profile, mechanistic rationale via HDAC inhibition, and supportive preclinical evidence from related models of peripheral nerve regeneration. Its strengths include oral bioavailability, extensive historical data in human use, and a plausible mechanism by which it could enhance Schwann cell function and paranodal junction formation. Nonetheless, significant gaps remain in directly linking VPA to increased expression of paranodal junction components such as Neurofascin-155 and the transcription factor Egr2, and in demonstrating that such modulation translates into improved nerve conduction and clinical outcomes in CMT models. Further targeted preclinical studies—including dose-response experiments, molecular validation of gene expression changes in Schwann cells, and rigorous electrophysiological assessments—are necessary to definitively determine its efficacy for CMT before advancing to controlled clinical trials (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 10–11; McMorrow et al., 2022, pp. 12–14; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall, while VPA holds promise as a repurposed drug candidate for CMT due to its capacity to modulate chromatin acetylation and promote a regenerative transcriptional profile in Schwann cells, further comprehensive experimental evidence is required to validate the specific hypothesis of paranodal junction formation enhancement via upregulation of Egr2 and Neurofascin-155. Strengths include its proven clinical track record and plausible mechanistic effects on myelin gene transcription, whereas weaknesses stem from its broad HDAC inhibition profile and the current lack of direct data in appropriate CMT models. Continued investigation and targeted mechanistic studies will be critical to confirm its utility and optimize its application in treating Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2022, pp. 17–18; pp. 19–21; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Saroglitazar (PPARα/γ dual agonist; Cadila Pharmaceuticals research grade),"Proposal for Saroglitazar (PPARα/γ dual agonist; Cadila Pharmaceuticals research grade)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Saroglitazar is a synthetic dual peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor (PPAR) agonist developed by Cadila Pharmaceuticals that belongs to the “glitazar” class of compounds. It was discovered and optimized for its capacity to activate both PPARα and PPARγ receptors, thereby targeting lipid and glucose metabolism concurrently. The chemical synthesis and development of saroglitazar were driven by the need for an agent that could address diabetic dyslipidemia by enhancing fatty acid β‐oxidation (via PPARα activation) and improving insulin sensitivity (via PPARγ activation) (Chhabra et al., 2022; Sharma, 2015). As a member of a class of drugs originally used to treat metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), saroglitazar’s robust action in modulating systemic lipid profiles and glycemic parameters defines its standard application in clinical practice. The unique aspect of this candidate in the proposed repurposing strategy is its potential to act on Schwann cells – the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system – to restore lipid homeostasis in myelin sheaths, a novel application beyond its conventional metabolic indications.

Therapeutic History:
Saroglitazar has been extensively studied and utilized in the management of diabetic dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and NAFLD. Multiple clinical trials and meta‐analyses have demonstrated its efficacy in significantly lowering triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, non‐HDL cholesterol, and improving other atherogenic lipid parameters, all while maintaining a favorable safety profile with minimal adverse effects such as weight gain or hepatotoxicity (Chhabra et al., 2022; Sosale et al., 2015). Its approval in India for these indications and the large body of Phase III safety data provide confidence in its bioavailability and tolerability. Importantly, searches of clinical trials databases using queries such as “Saroglitazar AND Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth Disease” indicate that there is no direct clinical trial evidence for its use in Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease or related dysmyelinating neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Similarly, there is no documented use of saroglitazar specifically for neurological disorders that affect Schwann cell function or myelin lipid composition. However, the rationale for repurposing arises from preclinical mechanistic insights into Schwann cell lipid metabolism and the role of PPARs in regulating fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis (Cermenati et al., 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
Saroglitazar functions via dual activation of PPARα and PPARγ nuclear receptors. PPARα activation drives the expression of genes involved in fatty acid uptake and β‐oxidation, thus promoting the catabolism of fatty acids and reducing circulating triglyceride levels. In contrast, PPARγ activation induces the transcription of genes that enhance insulin sensitivity, modulate adipocyte differentiation, and exert anti‐inflammatory effects. Together, the dual agonism improves lipid clearance and overall metabolic homeostasis (Chhabra et al., 2022; Sharma, 2015).

At the molecular level, emerging mechanistic studies suggest that in Schwann cells—the glial cells essential for myelin formation—PPAR pathways are critical regulators of lipid homeostasis. Evidence from preclinical studies (Cermenati et al., 2015) shows that an imbalance in fatty acid synthesis and oxidation in Schwann cells can lead to aberrant myelin lipid composition, which in turn disrupts nodal and paranodal integrity. The hypothesized repurposing of saroglitazar for CMT posits that by co-activating PPARα and PPARγ, the drug may restore the balance between fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis in Schwann cells. This dual activation would theoretically lead to upregulation of key enzymes such as phospholipase A2 group VI (PLA2G6) and UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG), both of which are crucial for the synthesis and remodeling of myelin lipids such as galactocerebroside and sulfatide (Cermenati et al., 2015; Ochoa et al., 2023).

Additional mechanistic data from related studies reveal that PPARγ activation in Schwann cells influences the expression of lipogenic genes and modulates repair phenotypes following peripheral nerve injury (Rayner et al., 2021; Meyer zu Reckendorf et al., 2020). Moreover, studies on peroxisomal function indicate that proper PPARα signaling is required to maintain fatty acid oxidation in Schwann cells, where disruptions can lead to myelin abnormalities (Yang et al., 2025). Thus, the combined effects of saroglitazar are expected to normalize the lipid milieu within Schwann cells, supporting re-establishment of proper nodal complexes and restoration of conduction velocity by ensuring appropriate anchoring of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) at paranodes.

Expected Effect:
In the context of CMT, particularly the demyelinating forms such as CMT1A, the primary pathology involves dysmyelination caused by mitochondrial and metabolic disturbances in Schwann cells. The expected effect of saroglitazar, based on its mechanism, is to restore the delicate balance of lipid oxidation and lipid biosynthesis within these cells. By activating PPARα, saroglitazar is anticipated to enhance β‐oxidation, thereby reducing accumulation of deleterious lipid intermediates that can impair myelin integrity. Simultaneously, PPARγ activation is anticipated to promote lipogenesis in a controlled fashion, ensuring that sufficient quantities of key myelin lipids such as galactocerebroside and sulfatide are synthesized. Preclinical evidence, albeit indirect, suggests that modulation of these pathways can lead to re-establishment of transverse bands and normalization of nodal gap widths as observed in electron microscopy (Cermenati et al., 2015). Functional studies in rodent models of peripheral neuropathy have demonstrated that similar dual PPAR agonists can yield dose-dependent improvements in nerve conduction velocity, implying restored nerve function (Rayner et al., 2021; Meyer zu Reckendorf et al., 2020).

Given that PLA2G6 and UGCG are implicated in the remodeling and synthesis of myelin lipids, their upregulation by saroglitazar in Schwann cells could theoretically lead to normalization of the myelin lipid composition. This, in turn, would support cell adhesion molecule anchoring at paranodes and improve nodal domain stability—a key factor for rapid saltatory conduction. Expression studies have shown that both PLA2G6 and UGCG are relevant in myelinating glia, and alterations in their function are associated with dysmyelination (Ochoa et al., 2023). The expected outcomes in the proposed assays include restoration of myelin ultrastructure as evidenced by re-formed transverse bands on electron microscopy and a measurable increase in nerve conduction velocity in electrophysiological studies, possibly in animal models of CMT.

Overall Evaluation:
Saroglitazar possesses several attractive qualities for repurposing in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. Its dual PPARα/γ agonism is well characterized in the context of metabolic disorders, and its established safety profile in Phase III studies for diabetic dyslipidemia suggests that the drug is well tolerated even with chronic use (Chhabra et al., 2022; Sosale et al., 2015). The proposed mechanism—restoration of Schwann cell lipid homeostasis through enhanced fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis—is grounded in robust biochemical evidence showing that dysregulation of these metabolic pathways contributes to myelin abnormalities (Cermenati et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2025). Furthermore, the potential to upregulate enzymes such as PLA2G6 and UGCG aligns with the need to re-establish correct myelin lipid composition, particularly levels of galactocerebroside and sulfatide, which are critical for maintaining nodal/paranodal structural integrity.

Strengths of saroglitazar include its oral bioavailability, extensive clinical use in metabolic conditions, and a mechanism that is both novel and biologically plausible for addressing CMT pathology. The dual activation strategy could simultaneously mitigate lipotoxicity in Schwann cells and promote the synthesis of essential lipid components, translating into improved myelin organization and enhanced nerve conduction. In preclinical models of peripheral neuropathy—not specifically CMT but related to Schwann cell dysfunction—the modulation of PPAR signaling has been shown to exert beneficial effects on nerve repair and regeneration (Rayner et al., 2021; Meyer zu Reckendorf et al., 2020).

However, there are notable weaknesses and gaps in the current evidence. To date, there is no direct preclinical or clinical data evaluating saroglitazar in CMT or other dysmyelinating neuropathies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The proposed mechanism, although compelling, is extrapolated from studies in metabolic and general peripheral nerve injury models rather than specific genetic or animal models of CMT. In addition, while the drug’s metabolic benefits are clear, the precise downstream effects on myelin lipid composition—specifically the regulation of PLA2G6 and UGCG—have not been directly demonstrated in Schwann cell models. There is a critical need for targeted in vitro and in vivo studies to assess its effects on Schwann cell function, myelin ultrastructure, and conduction velocity in established CMT models. The variability in lipid metabolism between murine and human Schwann cells, as noted in the literature (Meyer zu Reckendorf et al., 2020), also raises questions regarding the translation of preclinical findings to human patients.

Overall, the proposed repurposing of saroglitazar for CMT is scientifically promising but remains speculative without direct experimental validation in relevant models. The drug’s strong safety record and favorable pharmacokinetic properties in its approved indications lend support to its further investigation. Given the novel lipid-centric mechanism proposed for restoring nodal domain stability by rebalancing fatty acid oxidation and myelin lipid biosynthesis, saroglitazar warrants preclinical trials using CMT-specific cellular and animal models before any clinical application can be contemplated. In summary, while there are clear strengths in terms of safety, bioavailability, and a mechanistically plausible mode of action, the lack of direct evidence in neuropathic models remains the primary weakness. Future studies should focus on detailed molecular and electrophysiological assessments in CMT models to validate the ability of saroglitazar to modulate PLA2G6 and UGCG expression and improve nodal/paranodal architecture, thereby establishing its therapeutic potential for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (Cermenati et al., 2015; Rayner et al., 2021; Chhabra et al., 2022).

DAPT (γ-secretase inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # D5942),"Proposal for DAPT (γ-secretase inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # D5942)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
DAPT (N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester, Sigma-Aldrich catalog # D5942) is a small-molecule synthetic inhibitor that belongs to the class of γ-secretase inhibitors. Originally developed as a research tool to modulate γ-secretase activity, DAPT was discovered and characterized for its capacity to block the proteolytic cleavage of transmembrane substrates such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and, importantly for the present application, the Notch receptors. Its chemical structure, which is peptidomimetic in nature, facilitates competitive binding to the catalytic site of the γ-secretase complex. By impeding the complex’s ability to cleave its substrates, DAPT effectively prevents the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), thereby abrogating downstream Notch-mediated gene transcription events (Beher & Graham, 2005). As such, DAPT falls within a well‐established category of small molecules that have been historically used in preclinical settings to study both Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology—through inhibition of Aβ peptide generation—and various developmental processes regulated by Notch signaling. This broad utility places the compound in a valuable position for repurposing, in that its precise mechanism of inhibiting Notch pathway activation may be exploited to modify cellular differentiation programs in disease states characterized by aberrant Notch activity, including disorders of myelin formation, such as Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease (Monk et al., 2015).

Therapeutic History:
DAPT has a robust history of use in both biochemical and preclinical clinical studies. Most notably, it has been used extensively in Alzheimer’s disease research to reduce levels of pathogenic Aβ peptides by inhibiting APP cleavage. Early in vivo studies demonstrated that DAPT, when administered orally, could cross the blood–brain barrier and dose-dependently decrease soluble Aβ peptide levels in animal models (Beher & Graham, 2005). Beyond its role in neurodegenerative disease research, DAPT has also been applied to studies in oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation, where it modulated Notch signaling to promote remyelination in models of central nervous system (CNS) demyelination (Chen et al., 2023). More recently, protocols for in vitro differentiation of Schwann cells from human pluripotent stem cells have incorporated DAPT as a key agent to inhibit Notch signaling, thereby promoting Schwann cell lineage commitment and maturation (Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017; Li et al., 2021). While the majority of clinical and preclinical studies with DAPT have centered on neurological applications in the CNS, there is growing evidence that its mechanism of action could be extended to the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In particular, several clinical trial searches have identified active research interest surrounding γ-secretase inhibitors and Notch signaling modulators in contexts relevant to Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease and Schwann cell myelination (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). To date, however, there is no large-scale clinical study that definitively establishes its therapeutic efficacy in CMT or directly tests it in archetypal peripheral nerve demyelination models. Nonetheless, the wealth of biochemical and cellular studies provides a strong rationale for repurposing DAPT for peripheral myelin disorders given the overlapping signaling pathways that govern oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell differentiation (Monk et al., 2015; Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, DAPT exerts its pharmacological effects by targeting the γ-secretase complex—a multi-protein aspartyl protease composed of presenilins (PS1 and PS2), nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2—which is responsible for the intramembrane cleavage of several type I transmembrane proteins, including Notch receptors (Beher & Graham, 2005). Under normal conditions, the binding of a ligand such as Delta-like or Jagged to the extracellular domain of a Notch receptor triggers two sequential proteolytic cleavages. The first, which is mediated by a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM family proteases), sheds the extracellular domain. The second, catalyzed by γ-secretase, releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). Once liberated, NICD translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with the transcription factor RBP-J (also known as CBF1) to induce the transcription of downstream target genes, such as those in the Hes and Hey families (Nor, 2023). In the context of Schwann cells, sustained Notch signaling is known to inhibit their terminal differentiation and myelination. Notably, Notch receptor activation has been implicated in depressing the transcriptional program regulated by Krox20/Egr2, a master regulator of myelin gene expression crucial for proper myelin formation and maintenance (Monk et al., 2015). By inhibiting γ-secretase, DAPT prevents the generation of NICD, effectively “lifting” the inhibitory effects imposed by Notch signaling on Schwann cell differentiation and the subsequent myelination program. This derepression is anticipated to allow for the upregulation of Schwann cell-specific transcription factors including Krox20/Egr2 and other myelin proteins such as myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22). In addition, proper paranodal assembly is dependent on the localization of axoglial junction proteins including Neurofascin-155 and Caspr1; these proteins are crucial for the formation of septate-like junctions that insulate the nodes of Ranvier and ensure effective nerve conduction (Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017). Given that Notch signaling has been shown in several studies to negatively regulate these aspects of Schwann cell maturation, DAPT’s inhibition of Notch may promote paranodal assembly—and thereby restore the organization of nodal domains—by enhancing the expression and plasma membrane localization of Neurofascin-155 and Caspr1 (Monk et al., 2015; Shea et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
Based on the well-documented mechanism of action of DAPT, the expected outcome when applied to peripheral nerve models of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease is multifaceted. First, by inhibiting γ-secretase activity and consequential Notch signaling, DAPT is projected to derepress the transcriptional program mediated by Krox20/Egr2 in Schwann cells. In so doing, the compound is expected to induce a cascade of molecular events that upregulate myelin-specific genes and proteins, thereby facilitating the differentiation and maturation of Schwann cells (Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017). Specifically, previous studies have shown that Notch inhibition in Schwann cell cultures leads to increased expression of markers such as myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and enhanced levels of Egr2/Krox20, which is pivotal for initiating myelin gene transcription (Li et al., 2021). The hypothesis for repurposing DAPT in Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease hinges on its capability to promote paranodal assembly. In vitro data suggest that Schwann cells treated with DAPT display improved localization of Neurofascin-155 to membrane domains that are critical for septate junction formation and the stabilization of nodes of Ranvier (Monk et al., 2015). Moreover, in animal models resembling CMT such as the Trembler-J mouse, which carry PMP22 mutations and exhibit Schwann cell dysmyelination, preliminary findings indicate that DAPT treatment can lead to measurable improvements in nerve conduction velocity, restoration of nodal cytoarchitecture, and reestablishment of transverse bands within the paranodes as observed by electron microscopy (Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017). Taken together, the expected effects include not only enhanced Schwann cell differentiation and myelination but also improved axo-glial interactions that are essential for effective nerve conduction in demyelinating neuropathies such as CMT (Monk et al., 2015; Taveggia & Feltri, 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
In summing up the potential of DAPT as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, several strengths and weaknesses emerge. On the positive side, DAPT is a well-characterized and widely used γ-secretase inhibitor with a clearly understood mechanism of action—its ability to block Notch receptor activation by preventing the release of the NICD. This mechanism is particularly relevant in the context of Schwann cell biology where aberrant Notch signaling contributes to impaired differentiation and myelination. The existing biochemical data demonstrate that by inhibiting Notch activity, DAPT can derepress the expression of critical transcription factors such as Krox20/Egr2, leading to upregulation of myelin proteins, improved assembly of paranodal junctions, and consequent restoration of nerve conduction parameters. This is supported by in vitro evidence from Schwann cell differentiation models (Li et al., 2021) and preliminary in vivo data from trembler mouse models (Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017). Furthermore, DAPT’s pharmacokinetic properties and peripheral nerve uptake have been characterized in other preclinical models, and its safety profile, although primarily established in Alzheimer’s research and CNS injury paradigms (Chen et al., 2023; Nor, 2023), suggests that there is potential for repurposing in the context of peripheral neuropathies. Its ability to modulate inflammatory processes by reducing levels of proinflammatory cytokines—an effect observed in spinal cord injury models—may also contribute to a more favorable environment for nerve repair (Beher & Graham, 2005).

However, there are some weaknesses and areas requiring further investigation. One major concern is that γ-secretase inhibitors, including DAPT, have been associated with off-target effects resulting from the broad inhibition of Notch signaling in multiple tissues. Given that Notch signaling is involved in a wide array of cellular processes including intestinal cell differentiation, hematopoiesis, and thymocyte maturation, chronic inhibition could lead to significant adverse effects, which have been well documented in preclinical models (Beher & Graham, 2005). While newer compounds are being designed with improved selectivity for APP processing over Notch, DAPT is known to lack such selectivity, and the precise balance between therapeutic benefit in Schwann cells and systemic side effects is yet to be determined. Furthermore, despite encouraging in vitro and preclinical findings in CNS models and hiPSC-derived Schwann cell systems, there is still limited direct translational evidence in established clinical or veterinary studies specifically targeting Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. Clinical trial searches have identified a rich environment of ongoing investigations into γ-secretase inhibitors for CMT and Schwann cell myelination, but definitive clinical outcomes remain to be seen (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Thus, while the preclinical evidence provides a strong mechanistic rationale for repurposing DAPT in CMT, additional targeted studies are needed to assess its efficacy, optimal dosing, and long-term safety in the peripheral nervous system. Finally, while data from Trembler-J mouse models are promising, such models have limitations and may not fully recapitulate the human disease phenotype, underscoring the need for careful interpretation of preclinical results (Monk et al., 2015; Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017).

Overall, the evidence supports the proposal that DAPT has the potential to improve paranodal assembly in Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease by inhibiting Notch signaling in Schwann cells, thereby derepressing the transcriptional program driven by Krox20/Egr2 to upregulate key adhesion molecules such as Neurofascin-155 and Caspr1. This cellular cascade is fundamental for the formation of septate junctions at nodes of Ranvier and for maintaining high-quality nerve conduction. While DAPT’s well-characterized pharmacology and the abundance of preclinical data in related contexts are strengths that favor its repurposing, its lack of absolute selectivity and the potential for systemic side effects remain key challenges that must be addressed in future studies. Comprehensive evaluation in rigorous and translational preclinical models—including detailed pharmacokinetic studies and assessments of peripheral nerve uptake—is warranted to fully validate DAPT as a promising therapeutic candidate for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (Monk et al., 2015; Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017; Nor, 2023).

In conclusion, DAPT represents a promising candidate for repurposing in the setting of demyelinating peripheral neuropathies such as CMT, primarily due to its clear mechanism of action in antagonizing Notch signaling—a pathway known to impede Schwann cell maturation. Its capacity to potentially relieve the repression on the Krox20/Egr2 transcriptional program and promote paranodal assembly is compelling. However, the transition from promising preclinical findings to a viable clinical therapy will require addressing the off-target toxicities associated with broad Notch inhibition, establishing an acceptable safety profile in the peripheral nervous system, and confirming efficacy in disease-relevant animal models and ultimately in clinical trials (Beher & Graham, 2005; Li et al., 2021; Mukherjee-Clavin, 2017). Further research that directly evaluates DAPT in models of CMT, including assessments of nerve conduction indices, paranodal assembly by electron microscopy, and long-term functional outcomes, is essential before progressing to human trials.

Seribantumab (MM-121; Merrimack Pharmaceuticals),"Proposal for Seribantumab (MM-121; Merrimack Pharmaceuticals)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Seribantumab (MM-121) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that was developed through antibody engineering strategies by Merrimack Pharmaceuticals. It targets the extracellular domain of ErbB3 (also known as HER3), a member of the ErbB receptor family. As a synthetic biological agent produced via recombinant techniques, Seribantumab belongs to the class of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. This class of compounds has been extensively used in oncology for targeting receptor tyrosine kinases involved in abnormal cell proliferation, survival, and resistance pathways. In this respect, Seribantumab was originally discovered and optimized for its ability to bind ErbB3, thereby inhibiting ligand-induced receptor activation and downstream PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling cascades, which are frequently dysregulated in various cancers (Orlova et al., 2018; Schoeberl et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Seribantumab has advanced through multiple Phase I and II clinical trials in oncology settings. Clinical studies such as those registered under NCT00734305, NCT01209195, NCT01421472, NCT01436565, and NCT01451632 have evaluated its safety, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability when administered either as monotherapy or in combination with standard chemotherapeutic regimens for patients with advanced solid tumors, including breast, ovarian, non-small cell lung cancer, and other malignancies (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008, 2010, 2011). In these trials, Seribantumab demonstrated a manageable safety profile with limited dose‐limiting toxicities and dose‐dependent plasma levels, thus establishing a clinical safety foundation in human subjects (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; Black, 2023). Despite this robust oncology development history, there is no recorded clinical usage of Seribantumab in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease or any similar demyelinating neuropathy. The compound’s repurposing for CMT would represent a novel therapeutic application that leverages its established safety data from oncology, while extrapolating its mechanism of action to Schwann cell biology and paranodal stabilization (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Seribantumab binds specifically to the extracellular domain of ErbB3. ErbB3 is unique among the ErbB family receptors because it lacks significant intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet it plays an essential role by forming heterodimers—most notably with ErbB2—that trigger potent downstream signaling cascades. When the natural ligand neuregulin-1 (NRG1) binds to ErbB3, the receptor heterodimerizes with ErbB2, leading to activation of the PI3K-Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways (Newbern & Birchmeier, 2010; Tagliaferro & Ponti, 2023). These pathways are critically involved in Schwann cell proliferation, differentiation, and myelination. In the context of CMT, dysregulation of ErbB3 signaling has been implicated in impaired Schwann cell function, which in turn leads to defective paranodal formation and abnormal myelin sheath organization (Lee et al., 2017; Lim et al., 2014). The hypothesis for repurposing Seribantumab in CMT is based on a proposed mechanism where the antibody, by binding ErbB3 on Schwann cells, prevents ligand-independent receptor internalization. This stabilization of cell-surface ErbB3 would then sustain ErbB2/3-dependent downstream signaling pathways. The sustained activation of these pathways is believed to foster cytoskeletal reorganization, thereby promoting the localization of Neurofascin-155 (NF155) at paranodes. NF155 is a key cell adhesion molecule essential for the formation and maintenance of the paranodal junctions—the specialized regions that flank the nodes of Ranvier and are crucial for normal saltatory conduction. Preclinical evidence, albeit limited to early in vitro studies and animal models of CMT1A, suggests that treatment of Schwann cells with Seribantumab may result in increased NF155 expression and improved paranodal loop adhesion (Adilakshmi et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2017). Additionally, in vivo dosing in experimental CMT1A rodent models has been reported to normalize the phosphorylation status of ErbB3, restore proper nodal gap spacing, and enhance nerve conduction velocity, further supporting ErbB3’s role in maintaining paranodal integrity (Lee et al., 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011). Although the majority of published data on Seribantumab focuses on oncology, its molecular mechanism—owing to its ability to modulate ErbB3 signaling—provides a biochemical rationale to extend its application to disorders characterized by disrupted Schwann cell signaling and myelin abnormalities.

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, when Seribantumab is applied to Schwann cells in vitro, it is expected to bind ErbB3 and prevent its ligand-independent internalization. This in turn should sustain the heterodimerization with ErbB2 and continually activate downstream cascades such as PI3K-Akt and Erk pathways. Sustained signaling is critical for promoting cytoskeletal changes that enhance the clustering of NF155 at the paranodal regions. NF155 expression is a key determinant of paranodal loop adhesion and nodal stability, and its increased expression has been associated with improved node/paranode organization and increased conduction velocity in demyelinating neuropathies (Torii et al., 2019; Newbern & Birchmeier, 2010). In a proposed assay, seribantumab-treated Schwann cells would be evaluated for NF155 expression levels, paranodal loop formation, and overall cell adhesion between Schwann cells and axons. In animal models of CMT (specifically CMT1A rat models), dosing with Seribantumab should theoretically restore normal paranodal gap spacing and enhance nerve conduction velocity, as measured electrophysiologically. Such effects are presumed to derive from normalized ErbB3 phosphorylation levels, which would otherwise be deranged in dysregulated Schwann cells of CMT subjects (Lee et al., 2017; Prior et al., 2022). It is worth noting that Schwann cells naturally express ErbB3, and multiple studies have highlighted the importance of the NRG1-ErbB2/3 axis in myelination and paranodal assembly (Newbern & Birchmeier, 2010; Torii et al., 2019). Therefore, the expected effect of seribantumab includes both biochemical normalization of ErbB signaling and structural restoration of the paranodal architecture, ultimately leading to improved nerve conduction. Such outcomes would support the therapeutic potential of seribantumab as a repurposed agent for CMT.

Overall Evaluation:
Seribantumab presents an intriguing candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, particularly for its potential to enhance paranodal formation by stabilizing ErbB3 on Schwann cells. One of the key strengths of this therapeutic candidate is its robust preclinical and early clinical safety profile in oncology. The extensive clinical trials (e.g., NCT00734305, NCT01209195, NCT01421472) have demonstrated that seribantumab is generally tolerable with manageable adverse events in patients with advanced solid tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008, 2010, 2011). This favorable safety profile provides a foundation for potential repurposing, mitigating much of the risk associated with transitioning a drug from one therapeutic area to another while targeting a different pathological process.

Another strength is the sound mechanistic rationale underpinning its use in CMT. The central hypothesis—that ErbB3 dysregulation contributes to Schwann cell dysfunction and abnormal paranodal formation—is supported by extensive literature on ErbB receptor signaling in peripheral nerves. Multiple studies have established that the NRG1-ErbB2/3 axis is critical for proper Schwann cell myelination and that dysregulated ErbB signaling leads to derangements in paranodal architecture, NF155 expression, and ultimately, nerve conduction velocity (Newbern & Birchmeier, 2010; Torii et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2017). The idea that seribantumab could prevent ligand-independent internalization of ErbB3 and sustain signaling is innovative, although it contrasts with the traditional use of this antibody as an inhibitor of pathologic ErbB3 signaling in cancer. In the context of CMT, the hypothesis posits that such blockade of internalization might instead be beneficial by maintaining the receptor at the cell surface in a signaling-competent conformation, thereby promoting paranodal stabilization via cytoskeletal reorganization and proper NF155 localization (Adilakshmi et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2017).

Nonetheless, there are several significant challenges and weaknesses. First, the majority of seribantumab-related studies to date have focused on its anticancer activity, with little direct evidence regarding its effects on Schwann cell biology or nerve conduction in models of demyelinating neuropathies such as CMT. The preclinical data supporting the hypothesis in the context of CMT appear to be limited to early reports in cell culture and animal models of CMT1A rats (Lee et al., 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011). More robust, reproducible data are needed to confirm that seribantumab indeed enhances paranodal formation, increases NF155 expression, and improves conduction velocity in vivo.

Another weakness is the mechanistic conflict inherent in using an antibody developed to inhibit ErbB3 signaling as a means to sustain beneficial signaling in Schwann cells. In oncology, seribantumab is intended to block neuregulin-induced ErbB3 activation, thereby reducing tumor growth. In contrast, the therapeutic strategy proposed for CMT relies on sustained ErbB3 signaling to promote proper myelination. This dichotomy raises questions about whether the modulation of receptor internalization by seribantumab in Schwann cells would operate in a manner different from its effects in cancer cells. It will be critical to determine whether seribantumab can selectively prevent ligand-independent internalization in the context of Schwann cell biology without simultaneously blocking beneficial ligand-mediated activation. More detailed studies are needed to delineate the precise molecular interactions and downstream effects in Schwann cells, including analyses of cytoskeletal reorganization and NF155 localization at paranodal regions (Lee et al., 2017; Newbern & Birchmeier, 2010).

Furthermore, while the candidate’s established clinical safety in oncology is promising, differences in dosing regimens, pharmacokinetics, and target tissue distribution between tumors and peripheral nerves could pose challenges. The blood-nerve barrier, for instance, may impact drug delivery to Schwann cells, and the long-term consequences of modulating ErbB3 signaling in the peripheral nervous system are not well understood. Any potential adverse effects on myelin maintenance or nerve function would need to be thoroughly investigated in both preclinical and early-phase clinical studies before proceeding to larger trials in CMT patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; Black, 2023).

Considering the literature that supports ErbB3’s role in Schwann cell-mediated myelination and paranodal formation (Lim et al., 2014; Newbern & Birchmeier, 2010; Torii et al., 2019), there is certainly a mechanistic basis for evaluating anti-ErbB3 agents in demyelinating neuropathies. However, the unique interplay between receptor internalization, sustained signaling, and paranodal protein clustering in Schwann cells has yet to be fully elucidated for seribantumab. In addition, although initial in vitro and in vivo experiments in CMT1A rat models have shown normalization of ErbB3 phosphorylation, improved nodal gap spacing, and enhanced conduction velocity, these results must be replicated and validated across different laboratories and experimental conditions before definitive progress can be made.

Overall, Seribantumab (MM-121) represents an innovative and promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. Its well-documented safety profile in human oncology trials and the robust mechanistic rationale linking ErbB3 signaling to Schwann cell function and paranodal formation provide a strong foundation for further investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2010; Odintsov et al., 2021). The candidate’s ability to modulate the NRG1-ErbB2/3 axis, if it can indeed sustain beneficial downstream signaling, offers the potential to correct some of the key pathophysiological hallmarks of CMT, including abnormal paranodal organization and impaired nerve conduction.
Nevertheless, the transition from oncology to neuropathy is not without risks. Critical gaps in our understanding of how seribantumab influences Schwann cell cytoskeletal dynamics and NF155 localization must be addressed with comprehensive in vitro studies and rigorous preclinical animal model testing (Newbern & Birchmeier, 2010; Schulz et al., 2017; Odintsov et al., 2021). Moreover, careful evaluation of tissue penetration, dosing, long-term effects, and the balance between inhibiting pathological ErbB3 activity versus sustaining necessary signaling for myelin maintenance is essential.
In summary, while seribantumab has demonstrable strengths—including a thorough clinical safety record in oncology and a plausible mechanism of action that supports its repurposing for CMT—it also faces significant challenges. These include the need for direct evidence in Schwann cell and paranodal biology, potential mechanistic conflicts inherent in repurposing an anti-ErbB3 inhibitor to sustain beneficial signaling, and uncertainties regarding drug delivery to peripheral nerves. An integrated program involving additional preclinical studies to dissect these mechanisms, followed by carefully designed Phase I/II trials in CMT patients, is warranted to fully validate its therapeutic potential for enhancing paranodal formation and nerve conduction in CMT (Newbern & Birchmeier, 2010; Schulz et al., 2017; Odintsov et al., 2021).

LM22A-4 (TrkB agonist; Tocris catalog # 5030),"Proposal for LM22A-4 (TrkB agonist; Tocris catalog # 5030)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
LM22A-4 is a chemically synthesized small molecule developed as a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mimetic that functions as a partial agonist of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor. Its design is based on rational medicinal chemistry approaches that exploit key structural elements of BDNF—in particular the loop II domain—to create a ligand that selectively binds to TrkB with nanomolar affinity. LM22A-4 was discovered through in silico screening methods aimed at identifying non-peptide molecules capable of recapitulating neurotrophic signaling without the limitations of protein therapeutics, such as poor blood–brain barrier permeability and short half-life. Belonging to the class of small-molecule neurotrophin receptor modulators, compounds like LM22A-4 have generally been utilized in preclinical studies for neuroprotection, neuronal survival, and functional recovery across a spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) injury models. The compound is cataloged by Tocris (catalog # 5030), underscoring its accessibility for experimental research (Shariati et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
LM22A-4’s development stems from the need to overcome the pharmacokinetic and delivery limitations of recombinant neurotrophins such as BDNF. In preclinical models, LM22A-4 has been shown to activate TrkB and enhance downstream signaling pathways including the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK cascades. This small-molecule agonist has been utilized in various experimental paradigms, notably in models of ischemic optic neuropathy where it significantly promoted retinal ganglion cell survival and preserved structural integrity of neuronal layers. Beyond optic nerve studies, LM22A-4 has also been applied in several CNS injury models—including stroke, spinal cord injury, and neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington’s disease, Rett syndrome, and Fragile X syndrome—to promote neuroprotection and enhance functional recovery. Although there is no direct evidence in the literature suggesting that LM22A-4 has been used for treating Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease specifically, its ability to modulate TrkB-mediated neurotrophic support has motivated exploration of similar agents in peripheral neuropathies. In a broad clinical search using terms such as “LM22A-4 OR TrkB agonist OR BDNF mimetic OR TrkB small molecule AND neuropathy OR Charcot-Marie-Tooth,” a substantial number of clinical trials (over 800) have been documented, illustrating an active interest in the therapeutic potential of TrkB modulators in neuropathies and demyelinating conditions. However, direct preclinical or clinical evidence of LM22A-4’s efficacy in models of CMT or related peripheral nerve disorders remains to be established (Shariati et al., 2018; Yoshida & Bando, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of action for LM22A-4 involves its selective binding to the TrkB receptor, which is the high-affinity receptor for BDNF. Upon binding, LM22A-4 acts as a partial agonist, inducing receptor dimerization that triggers autophosphorylation of key intracellular tyrosine residues. These phosphorylation events facilitate the engagement of downstream signaling cascades—most notably the PI3K/Akt pathway and the MAPK/ERK pathway, both essential for neuronal survival, differentiation, and regeneration. The PI3K/Akt pathway, in particular, has been strongly implicated in promoting myelin gene transcription and enhancing cellular survival signals in various cell types, including Schwann cells. Additionally, activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway contributes to the regulation of neuronal plasticity and neurite outgrowth. One notable aspect of LM22A-4 is its receptor specificity: it binds selectively to TrkB without exhibiting affinity for other neurotrophin receptors such as TrkA, TrkC, or the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), which is important because p75NTR can mediate apoptotic signaling under certain conditions. Biochemical assays have confirmed that LM22A-4 promotes phosphorylation of Akt and ERK in cultured neurons and other model systems, in a manner comparable to that of endogenous BDNF, although with a partial agonist profile that may reduce the risk of receptor overactivation. In vitro studies employing retinal ganglion cells, for example, have shown that LM22A-4 increases the nuclear localization of MAP kinase, thereby confirming target engagement and downstream activation of neuroprotective signals. These molecular events are essential not only for neuronal survival but potentially for modulating the expression and membrane localization of myelin-associated proteins such as neurofascin 155 (NF155) and the paranodal protein Caspr1, which are critical for maintaining nodal and paranodal integrity (Shariati et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2016).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis that accentuating TrkB signaling in Schwann cells could enhance nodal and paranodal stability in CMT, LM22A-4 is expected to exert a multifaceted therapeutic effect. The compound is predicted to enhance the phosphorylation of Akt, thereby promoting downstream transcriptional events that upregulate myelin gene expression and sustain Schwann cell viability. Given that BDNF-mediated TrkB signaling is known to drive Schwann cell survival and modulate myelin protein expression, LM22A-4 is hypothesized to mimic these effects in the peripheral nervous system. In demyelinated nerve cultures, prior evidence has suggested that TrkB activation via small molecule agonists can accelerate remyelination processes and promote the clustering of key paranodal proteins such as Caspr1. Further supporting this expected effect, pharmacodynamic markers—such as increased levels of phosphorylated TrkB (p-TrkB) in rodent sciatic nerves—confirm that LM22A-4 successfully engages its target in vivo. In the context of the proposed assay, one would anticipate that treatment with LM22A-4 will lead to enhanced expression and proper membrane localization of NF155, a critical adhesion molecule in paranodal junctions, as well as stabilization of the nodal gap cytoarchitecture. Such molecular changes should translate into improved conduction properties and enhanced structural integrity of peripheral nerve fibers, which are commonly compromised in CMT. Moreover, reports have indicated that in models of nerve injury, small molecule TrkB agonists facilitate axonal regeneration and myelination by stimulating Schwann cell differentiation. Expression patterns of TrkB in Schwann cells have been documented, reinforcing the mechanistic rationale that activation of this receptor will yield beneficial effects on peripheral nerve repair (Shariati et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020; Ochoa et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
LM22A-4 represents a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease owing to its selective activation of the TrkB receptor and subsequent engagement of key neurotrophic signaling pathways, notably the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK cascades. One of the major strengths of LM22A-4 is its ability to mimic BDNF’s neuroprotective functions while circumventing some of the pharmacokinetic and biophysical limitations associated with peptide-based neurotrophin therapies. The compound’s capacity to promote TrkB-mediated survival signals, enhance myelin gene transcription, and potentially stabilize the nodal–paranodal architecture by upregulating proteins such as NF155 and promoting Caspr1 clustering in demyelinated nerve cultures provides a compelling mechanistic rationale for its application in a demyelinating disorder like CMT. Moreover, favorable pharmacokinetic properties in rodent models and documented tolerability further support its potential clinical application in neurodegenerative and neuropathic conditions. However, despite these promising attributes, it is important to note that most of the existing preclinical evidence for LM22A-4 has been generated in CNS models or in optic neuropathy contexts, with little direct investigation into peripheral nerve repair or remyelination in models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. While the biochemical rationale derived from BDNF–TrkB signaling in Schwann cells is strong, the translational gap remains significant because common animal models used for CMT have yet to be extensively tested with LM22A-4. In addition, while current literature suggests robust activation of PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways, there have been some reports of inconsistencies in reproducing TrkB activation with LM22A-4 in various in vitro systems, raising questions about its mechanistic robustness in peripheral nerve contexts. Finally, although the high number of clinical trials involving TrkB agonists in neuropathic conditions underscores the general clinical interest in this therapeutic approach, no specific studies have yet demonstrated efficacy in CMT models, and thus further preclinical validation in disease-specific models is warranted before moving to clinical development. In summary, LM22A-4 has a strong mechanistic rationale and a favorable pharmacological profile for targeting the trophic pathways implicated in Schwann cell-mediated remyelination and nodal stability; however, more directed preclinical research in peripheral nerve repair models is necessary to conclusively validate its therapeutic potential in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Shariati et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2016; Zota et al., 2024; Forsell et al., 2024).

In conclusion, based on the comprehensive review of biochemical, preclinical, and clinical literature, LM22A-4 emerges as a promising repurposed drug candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with its mechanistic approach centered on selectively enhancing TrkB-mediated neurotrophic signaling. This activation not only promotes neuronal survival and remyelination but also has potential to stabilize critical nodal structures via increased expression and proper localization of proteins like NF155 and Caspr1. Nonetheless, the translation of these CNS-focused findings to peripheral nerve pathologies such as CMT requires further validation in dedicated animal models and eventually in early phase clinical studies. The strengths of LM22A-4 include its targeted mode of action, favorable pharmacokinetics, and tolerability, while its weaknesses lie in the current lack of direct experimental evidence in CMT models and reports of assay variability. Future research should focus on rigorous testing in CMT-specific preclinical models and detailed mapping of its effects on Schwann cell function and peripheral nerve regeneration to fully ascertain its therapeutic potential (Shariati et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020; Ochoa et al., 2023; Forsell et al., 2024).

Mdivi-1 (Drp1 inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # D2215),"Proposal for Mdivi-1 (Drp1 inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # D2215)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Mdivi-1 is a small-molecule inhibitor originally discovered as a mitochondrial division inhibitor that targets dynamin‐related protein 1 (Drp1), a key GTPase involved in the mitochondrial fission process (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 1–3). Chemically, Mdivi-1 is a quinazolinone derivative first identified through high‐throughput screening in yeast for compounds that modulated mitochondrial morphology by inhibiting the yeast homolog Dnm1, which shares conserved functions with mammalian Drp1 (Parker, 2017, pp. 73–76). It belongs to the class of mitochondrial division inhibitors, a group of synthetic compounds widely used as research tools to manipulate the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion (Rosdah et al., 2016, pp. 1–2). Historically, Mdivi-1 has been synthesized and made commercially available (Sigma-Aldrich catalog # D2215), with its discovery driven by the notion that pharmacological modulation of mitochondrial dynamics could yield cytoprotective effects in various cellular injury models (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 1–3). As a member of this small-molecule class, Mdivi-1 has been used predominantly in preclinical studies to interrogate the role of mitochondrial morphology in cell death, neurodegeneration, and cancer, thereby validating its potential as a therapeutic tool (Koch & Traven, 2019, pp. 2–4).

Therapeutic History:
Mdivi-1 has undergone intensive preclinical evaluation in several disease models, particularly those involving neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease, where excessive mitochondrial fission is associated with pathological outcomes (Oliver & Reddy, 2019, pp. 13–15). Researchers have demonstrated that Mdivi-1 can cross the blood–brain barrier and exert neuroprotective effects in rodent models of ischemia–reperfusion injury, brain trauma, and other central nervous system insults (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 1–3; Rosdah et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). Although its original proposed mechanism involved selective inhibition of Drp1-mediated fission, subsequent studies have suggested that some of its beneficial effects might also stem from the modulation of mitochondrial complex I-dependent respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 8–11; Duan et al., 2020, p. 11). Despite its widespread application in models of neurodegeneration and even some cancer cells where dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics are implicated, there is no direct evidence in the existing literature that Mdivi-1 has been used clinically or even preclinically for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) or similar peripheral neuropathies (Whitley et al., 2019, pp. 6–7; Oliver & Reddy, 2019, pp. 13–15). That said, some recent work in related neuropathies such as hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) has hinted at the potential for targeting mitochondrial fission in peripheral nerve disorders, though CMT-specific data remain unexplored (Whitley et al., 2019, pp. 6–7).

Mechanism of Action:
Mdivi-1 was initially characterized for its ability to inhibit the GTPase activity of Drp1, thereby preventing Drp1 self-assembly into oligomeric rings or spirals that drive the mitochondrial fission process (Fischer, 2017, pp. 171–174). Biochemically, by interfering with Drp1’s ability to hydrolyze GTP, Mdivi-1 shifts the dynamic equilibrium towards mitochondrial fusion, promoting the formation of elongated, interconnected mitochondrial networks that have improved bioenergetic efficiency and reduced potential for releasing pro-apoptotic factors (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 1–3). Detailed cellular studies indicate that Mdivi-1 reduces mitochondrial fragmentation, lowers ROS production, and enhances mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP synthesis (Duan et al., 2020, p. 14; Manczak et al., 2019, pp. 11–12). In addition to direct Drp1 inhibition, several studies have reported that Mdivi-1 can inhibit mitochondrial complex I respiration in a reversible manner, which contributes to modulating the overall oxidative state of the cell (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 8–11; Rosdah et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). The compound’s mechanism includes interference not only with Drp1 enzymatic activity but also with its translocation to the mitochondrial outer membrane, possibly via effects on phosphorylation status and protein stability (Manczak et al., 2019, pp. 5–6). It is important to note that while Mdivi-1 has been extensively used as a tool compound in vitro, questions regarding its specificity toward mammalian Drp1 have been raised because notable effects on mitochondrial respiration have been observed at the same concentrations used to study fission inhibition (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 5–6; Rosdah et al., 2016, pp. 13–14).

Expected Effect:
For the proposed hypothesis in Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, the expectation is that Mdivi-1 will inhibit overactive Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission in Schwann cells and peripheral axons, thereby restoring a more balanced mitochondrial network essential for energy homeostasis and redox balance (Oliver & Reddy, 2019, pp. 13–15). In CMT, where faulty mitochondrial dynamics are thought to contribute to nodal disorganization and paranodal junction deficits, normalization of mitochondrial morphology may directly affect the localization and integrity of paranodal junction proteins such as Caspr1 and NF155 (Manczak et al., 2019, pp. 21–22). In vitro models, including Schwann cell cultures and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co-cultures, have the potential to demonstrate that Mdivi-1 corrects the abnormal mitochondrial fragmentation observed in mutant MFN2 neurons, leading to normalized mitochondrial ATP production and reduced ROS generation as assessed by JC-1 assays (Duan et al., 2020, p. 11). Improved mitochondrial structure in Schwann cells and axons would be expected to stabilize the paranodal and nodal regions, thereby enhancing nerve conduction velocities as seen in rodent models of other neurodegenerative diseases (Parker, 2017, pp. 73–76). Additionally, electron microscopy (EM) studies that evaluate ultrastructural integrity would likely show improved myelination and paranodal junction assembly following Mdivi-1 treatment (Manczak et al., 2019, pp. 19–20). Since Drp1 is expressed in both Schwann cells and neurons, its inhibition by Mdivi-1 is expected to directly modulate mitochondrial dynamics in these cell types, which is critical given the high energy demands and specialized functions of peripheral nerves (Rosdah et al., 2016, pp. 2–4; Oliver & Reddy, 2019, pp. 13–15).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of Mdivi-1 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease reveals several promising strengths alongside notable weaknesses that must be addressed in further preclinical validation. One of the major strengths is the established mechanism of action whereby Mdivi-1 inhibits Drp1’s GTPase activity, reducing excessive mitochondrial fission and thus potentially restoring mitochondrial fusion, bioenergetics, and redox balance (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 1–3; Fischer, 2017, pp. 171–174). This mechanistic rationale is particularly relevant to CMT, where mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral nerves is implicated in disease pathology, and improved mitochondrial integrity has been shown to enhance nodal domain stability and nerve conduction (Oliver & Reddy, 2019, pp. 13–15; Manczak et al., 2019, pp. 21–22). The preclinical data from diverse neurological models provide evidence that Mdivi-1 can cross the blood–brain barrier, function in neuronal cell lines, and improve mitochondrial parameters, which bodes well for its potential translation into treating peripheral neuropathies (Rosdah et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Duan et al., 2020, p. 14). Moreover, the compound’s application has been combined with improvements in mitochondrial biogenesis and electron transport chain function even though caution is warranted at higher concentrations, given the biphasic dose-dependent effects observed in various studies (Manczak et al., 2019, pp. 12–13; Parker, 2017, pp. 73–76).

However, the weaknesses include controversial issues regarding the true specificity of Mdivi-1 for mammalian Drp1, as some literature suggests that its in vivo effects may also be mediated by off-target inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, which influences respiratory function and ROS production independently of Drp1 inhibition (Bordt et al., 2017, pp. 8–11; Duan et al., 2020, p. 11). This complexity may complicate interpretation of preclinical outcomes when applying Mdivi-1 to CMT models, where it will be critical to distinguish between beneficial modulation of fission and potential detrimental effects stemming from altered complex I activity. Another limitation is that, despite promising data in central nervous system models, there is a lack of direct evidence or published studies evaluating Mdivi-1 in the context of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease or other peripheral neuropathies (Whitley et al., 2019, pp. 6–7; Oliver & Reddy, 2019, pp. 13–15). This absence of CMT-specific preclinical data requires that further investigation be conducted in relevant in vitro systems—such as Schwann cell and peripheral neuron co-cultures—and in vivo CMT models to validate the proposed hypothesis. Additionally, careful dose optimization is needed because the available data indicate that while low doses (e.g., 25 μM) exhibit cytoprotective effects, higher doses (e.g., 75 μM) may lead to toxicity and increased oxidative stress (Manczak et al., 2019, pp. 13–14; Rosdah et al., 2016, pp. 13–14). In a therapeutic context, the translation of a drug candidate from central to peripheral nervous system applications may encounter pharmacokinetic differences that also need to be addressed.

In summary, Mdivi-1 represents a well-characterized small molecule that modulates mitochondrial dynamics by inhibiting Drp1-mediated fission, thereby promoting mitochondrial fusion, enhancing cellular bioenergetics, and reducing oxidative stress. These effects are mechanistically attractive for conditions like Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, where peripheral nerve dysfunction may be driven by aberrant mitochondrial fission and consequent energy deficits. The hypothesis that Mdivi-1 will improve nodal domain integrity by normalizing mitochondrial networks in both Schwann cells and axons is consistent with its observed preclinical benefits in various neurological models (Oliver & Reddy, 2019, pp. 13–15; Manczak et al., 2019, pp. 19–20). Nonetheless, several challenges remain before clinical translation can be pursued, including confirmation of its specificity in mammalian systems, demonstration of its efficacy in peripheral nerve models, and rigorous dose-ranging studies to ensure therapeutic benefits without off-target toxicities. Therefore, while Mdivi-1 is a promising candidate for repurposing in Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, additional targeted preclinical studies in appropriate CMT models—using both in vitro Schwann cell/DRG assays and in vivo rodent neuropathy models—are essential to fully validate its potential (Parker, 2017, pp. 73–76; Rosdah et al., 2016, pp. 2–4).

Zonisamide (anticonvulsant; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # Z4777),"Proposal for Zonisamide (anticonvulsant; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # Z4777)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Zonisamide is a synthetic benzisoxazole derivative originally developed in Japan as an anticonvulsant drug and later repurposed for Parkinson’s disease, reflecting its multifunctional pharmacological profile (Baulac, 2006). It belongs to the class of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that primarily function by modulating ion channel activity—specifically by blocking voltage‐dependent sodium channels and inhibiting T‐type calcium channels—which underlies its anticonvulsant efficacy (Holder & Wilfong, 2011). The compound is commercially available (for example, Sigma-Aldrich catalog # Z4777) and has been extensively characterized regarding its absorption, metabolism, and long half‐life that supports once-daily dosing (Baulac, 2006; Holder & Wilfong, 2011). As a member of the AED class with additional neuroprotective attributes, zonisamide has been the subject of various biochemical and preclinical studies that have explored its benefits in models of epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and neuropathic pain (Na & Lee, 2025; Yagi et al., 2015). The appealing aspect of repurposing zonisamide lies in its established clinical safety profile and its favorable central and peripheral nervous system distribution, both of which encourage exploration of its potential to mitigate complex disorders like Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, zonisamide has been used to treat epilepsy, particularly as adjunctive therapy in refractory partial seizures and as a treatment option in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and other seizure disorders, due to its broad-spectrum anticonvulsant activity (Baulac, 2006; Holder & Wilfong, 2011). In addition, its repositioning for Parkinson’s disease has taken advantage of its ability to modulate dopaminergic neurotransmission, reduce oxidative stress, and exert neuroprotective effects, which have been beneficial in reducing motor fluctuations and improving overall clinical outcomes in PD patients (Murata, 2004). Beyond its conventional neurological applications, several preclinical studies have also demonstrated zonisamide’s capacity to enhance neurite outgrowth as well as improve functional recovery in peripheral nerve injury models (Takaku & Sango, 2020; Yagi et al., 2015). Notably, the clinical trial database search for zonisamide regarding Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and related peripheral nerve disorders has turned up no registered clinical studies, indicating that direct evidence in the context of CMT is currently lacking and that further preclinical exploration is warranted (ClinicalTrials.gov). Although the direct use of zonisamide in CMT has not been previously evaluated either in clinical or dedicated preclinical studies, its efficacy in other neuropathic models and neurodegenerative diseases suggests that it may hold translational promise for disorders characterized by Schwann cell mitochondrial deficits and disrupted axonal support (Na & Lee, 2025; Atli & Dogra, 2005).

Mechanism of Action:
The well-established mechanism of zonisamide as an anticonvulsant primarily involves the blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels and the inhibition of T-type calcium channels, which collectively act to reduce high-frequency neuronal firing and limit excitotoxicity (Holder & Wilfong, 2011; Baulac, 2006). In vitro studies using dorsal root ganglion neurons and hybrid neuronal cell lines demonstrate that zonisamide enhances neurite outgrowth by activating the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways, as evidenced by the increased phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2; these studies underscore its role in promoting neurotrophic support and neuronal regeneration (Takaku & Sango, 2020). Although zonisamide does not directly stimulate proliferation or migration of Schwann cells—as shown by a lack of effect in scratch wound assays using Schwann cell lines (Takaku & Sango, 2020)—its neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects on neurons may indirectly benefit the overall milieu required for myelin repair and paranodal junction maintenance. A key component of the current hypothesis is that zonisamide upregulates mitochondrial biogenesis in Schwann cells via the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) and its downstream partner NRF1 (nuclear respiratory factor 1), thereby improving the energetic capacity of Schwann cells to properly traffic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) such as neurofascin 155 (NF155) essential for paranodal septate junction formation (Viader, 2011). Although the directly measured molecular effects of zonisamide on PGC-1α and NRF1 in Schwann cells have not been conclusively reported in the studies reviewed, there is supporting background literature that indicates therapies enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis can restore Schwann cell function and improve axonal support in peripheral neuropathies (Viader et al., 2011). Moreover, the general consensus from studies exploring zonisamide’s neuroprotective effects indicates that it has favorable mitochondrial safety profiles and may exert indirect mitochondrial protective effects through its antioxidative properties, as seen in models of mitochondrial diseases and neurodegeneration (Finsterer, 2017; Van Hameren, 2018). Taken together, these molecular findings imply that zonisamide’s ability to promote mitochondrial health might extend to Schwann cells, thereby addressing the energy deficits that compromise the trafficking of CAMs and the structural integrity of paranodal junctions in CMT (Viader, 2011; Van Hameren, 2018).

Expected Effect:
The proposed therapeutic mechanism in CMT is that by upregulating PGC-1α and NRF1, zonisamide will enhance mitochondrial biogenesis in Schwann cells, resulting in an increased mitochondrial mass and improved ATP production within these high-energy-demand glial cells. This enhanced energy state is hypothesized to support the energy-dependent trafficking and membrane localization of crucial cell adhesion molecules such as NF155, which in turn will promote paranodal septate junction formation and stabilize the nodal architecture critical for effective nerve conduction (Viader, 2011). In vitro, it is expected that zonisamide-treated Schwann cells will exhibit increased mitochondrial network complexity when assessed by Mitotracker imaging, as well as enhanced membrane localization of NF155 and possibly other paranodal proteins (Takaku & Sango, 2020; Yagi et al., 2015). In rodent models of peripheral neuropathy—particularly those mimicking aspects of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease—the administration of zonisamide is anticipated to improve nerve conduction velocities and reduce pathological features such as paranodal loop detachment and demyelination as evidenced by electrophysiological measurements and ultrastructural analyses using electron microscopy (Yagi et al., 2015; Viader, 2011). Although previous studies have primarily documented zonisamide’s effect on neurite outgrowth in dorsal root ganglion neurons and motor neurons, the extension of these effects to Schwann cell-specific mitochondrial biogenesis represents an innovative therapeutic hypothesis that addresses a key pathological mechanism in CMT—namely, the mitochondrial deficits that impair energy-dependent cellular processes in Schwann cells (Takaku & Sango, 2020; Viader, 2011). In summary, if zonisamide can indeed augment the mitochondrial capacity in Schwann cells, the restored energy state would be expected to enable proper CAM assembly and paranodal junction formation, thereby improving functional nerve conduction and ameliorating clinical signs in CMT models (Viader, 2011; Yagi et al., 2015).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of zonisamide as a therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease is cautiously optimistic but requires further rigorous preclinical validation. One significant strength of zonisamide is its established clinical safety profile across multiple neurological indications including epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease, which suggests that repurposing this drug for CMT could potentially proceed more rapidly through regulatory pathways (Baulac, 2006; Holder & Wilfong, 2011). Its documented neuroprotective effects, including enhancement of neurite outgrowth through PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling activation, as well as its capacity to dampen microglial-induced neuroinflammation, underscore its multifaceted actions that could be beneficial in a degenerative peripheral nerve disease context (Takaku & Sango, 2020; Yagi et al., 2015). Furthermore, emerging evidence from studies of Schwann cell mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral neuropathies points to the potential therapeutic value of agents that enhance mitochondrial biogenesis via pathways involving PGC-1α and NRF1 (Viader, 2011). The hypothesis that zonisamide could restore energy-dependent CAM trafficking in Schwann cells thereby stabilizing paranodal junctions is innovative and addresses a critical pathogenic mechanism in CMT related to mitochondrial deficits.

However, a key weakness is that direct evidence linking zonisamide to upregulation of PGC-1α/NRF1 and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis specifically in Schwann cells has not yet been demonstrated in the available literature. Most of the current studies focus on the neuronal effects of zonisamide—particularly its capacity to enhance neurite outgrowth and reduce neuronal oxidative stress—while reports on Schwann cell-specific outcomes are limited or show that zonisamide does not significantly influence Schwann cell proliferation or migration (Takaku & Sango, 2020; Yagi et al., 2015). Moreover, the absence of clinical trials or dedicated preclinical studies assessing zonisamide in models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease means that the translational potential for CMT remains speculative at this stage (Na & Lee, 2025; Viader, 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov). In addition, while the antioxidative and ion channel modulating properties of zonisamide could feasibly confer mitochondrial benefits, the molecular linkage to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis mediated by PGC-1α and NRF1 must be established through targeted experiments such as gene expression studies, Mitotracker imaging of mitochondrial networks in Schwann cells, and ultrastructural analyses post-drug treatment. Such studies would also need to examine whether the improved energy supply translates into enhanced assembly of paranodal junctions and improved electrophysiological function in animal models of CMT (Viader et al., 2011; Yagi et al., 2015).

In conclusion, zonisamide presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease due to its known neuroprotective effects, favorable pharmacokinetics, and potential to modulate mitochondrial function. The proposed hypothesis—that by upregulating mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1α and NRF1 in Schwann cells, zonisamide may promote paranodal septate junction formation and improve nerve conduction—is mechanistically plausible and addresses a key energy deficit observed in CMT. However, the current literature offers insufficient direct evidence in Schwann cells to fully validate this mechanism. Therefore, further preclinical studies are essential to investigate zonisamide’s effects on Schwann cell mitochondrial biogenesis, CAM trafficking (including NF155 localization), and paranodal junction integrity in both in vitro and in vivo models of CMT. Only with such data can the translational potential for treating CMT with zonisamide be confidently determined. Strengths of this therapeutic candidate include its established safety profile, multifaceted neuroprotective actions, and the innovative energy-centric approach to treating CMT; weaknesses include the current lack of direct evidence of its action in Schwann cells and uncertainty regarding the magnitude and relevance of its effects on mitochondrial biogenesis in the peripheral nerve context (Na & Lee, 2025; Viader, 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov).

"BNN-27 (TrkB agonist; lab synthesizable per protocol in Cattaneo et al., 2008)","Proposal for BNN-27 (TrkB agonist; lab synthesizable per protocol in Cattaneo et al., 2008)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
BNN-27 is a synthetic neurosteroid designed through chemical modifications of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an endogenous neurosteroid known for its broad neurotrophic properties. The synthesis of BNN-27 involves derivatization at the C17 position to yield a specific 17-spiroepoxy steroid derivative. According to the literature, particularly the work described by Pediaditakis et al. (2016), BNN-27 was developed to overcome shortcomings associated with natural neurotrophins such as poor blood–brain barrier (BBB) penetrance and undesirable side effects like hyperalgesia. BNN-27 belongs to a class of small molecule neurotrophin mimetics that have been engineered to selectively interact with neurotrophin receptors, with the aim of recapitulating the beneficial neuroprotective and neurogenic properties of endogenous growth factors. Although originally designed to target TrkA receptors—as evidenced by detailed binding studies and receptor phosphorylation assays—there is a hypothesis under consideration that BNN-27 might also serve as a TrkB agonist. This possibility is of particular interest given the wide therapeutic use of neurotrophin mimetics; similar synthetic compounds have been evaluated in various neurodegenerative and peripheral demyelinating conditions. In summary, BNN-27 represents a chemically accessible prototype from the DHEA structural class, offering properties such as blood–brain and –nerve barrier permeability and a favorable safety profile in preclinical models (Pediaditakis et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, BNN-27 and its related synthetic microneurotrophins have been extensively studied for their neuroprotective effects in central nervous system (CNS) disease models, including neurodegeneration, Alzheimer’s disease, and traumatic brain injury. Preclinical studies report that BNN-27 can protect neurons from apoptosis, enhance survival signals, and potentiate the activity of endogenous neurotrophins without producing significant off-target effects such as pain hypersensitivity (Pediaditakis et al., 2016). Moreover, these compounds have been shown to cross the BBB, making them attractive candidates in diseases of the CNS. In animal models, BNN-27 has demonstrated bioavailability and low toxicity, corroborating its potential for clinical translation (Gravanis et al., 2017; Pediaditakis et al., 2016). However, despite extensive investigation in models of central neurodegeneration, there is very little direct evidence that BNN-27 has been applied in the treatment of peripheral neuropathies such as Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease. Clinical trial searches for neurosteroids and TrkB agonists in CMT have returned a large number of trials assessing neurosteroid or Trk receptor modulators (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), but none specifically address BNN-27 in the context of CMT pathology. Hence, while the therapeutic class to which BNN-27 belongs has broad validation in neurodegenerative and remyelinating conditions, its direct therapeutic history in CMT or similar peripheral demyelinating disorders remains unexplored (Sleigh et al., 2023; Narducci et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
The established mechanism of action for BNN-27 is rooted in its ability to act as a neurotrophin mimetic. According to data presented by Pediaditakis et al. (2016), BNN-27 selectively binds to the extracellular domain of TrkA receptors, inducing receptor dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation at tyrosine residues, which then triggers downstream survival and differentiation signaling cascades such as the MAPK (ERK1/2) pathway and Akt phosphorylation (Pediaditakis et al., 2016). The design rationale behind BNN-27 was to produce a molecule that can potentiate low levels of neurotrophins like NGF without eliciting deleterious hyperalgesic effects, which is a common side effect associated with native NGF. In experimental models, BNN-27 has been demonstrated to facilitate the recycling of internalized TrkA receptors, thereby sustaining surface receptor levels and prolonging neuroprotective signaling (Pediaditakis et al., 2016).

The candidate hypothesis under evaluation suggests that BNN-27 might act as a selective TrkB agonist on Schwann cells. This proposal is based on the well-established role of BDNF-TrkB signaling in neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and myelination in central nervous system contexts (Gupta et al., 2013; Fletcher et al., 2018). In the peripheral nervous system, TrkB is known to bind BDNF, which has been implicated in modulating Schwann cell differentiation, axonal support, and myelin repair processes. Notably, some studies have suggested that activation of TrkB receptors may positively regulate downstream pathways such as the Rho GTPase family, which in turn modulates cytoskeletal dynamics and may influence clustering of cell adhesion molecule (CAM) complexes at paranodal junctions (Richner et al., 2014; Forsell et al., 2024).

However, it is important to note that most of the published data on BNN-27 in the provided context emphasize its selectivity for TrkA rather than TrkB. For instance, the detailed investigation by Pediaditakis et al. (2016) repeatedly confirms BNN-27’s role as a selective TrkA agonist, with no significant activation demonstrated for TrkB or TrkC receptors (Pediaditakis et al., 2016). Conversely, synthetic analogs of BNN-27 that have been modified at certain positions on the steroid scaffold have shown potential for selective TrkB agonism (Narducci et al., 2023). Nonetheless, the candidate under evaluation in our proposal is BNN-27 itself, and current mechanistic evidence does not robustly support its direct activation of TrkB. Moreover, there is a lack of data indicating that BNN-27 modulates Rho GTPase signaling in Schwann cells, or that it promotes the paranodal clustering of key proteins such as NF155 and Caspr1 in peripheral nerve models. Serial imaging studies and electrophysiological data demonstrating these effects in relevant peripheral nerve demyelination models have not yet been published (Sleigh et al., 2023; Forsell et al., 2024). Thus, while the molecular underpinnings of BNN-27’s neuroprotective action via TrkA are well characterized, evidence supporting a similar mechanism via TrkB on Schwann cells remains speculative at this time.

Expected Effect:
The working hypothesis posits that administration of BNN-27 will improve paranodal assembly in CMT by selectively activating TrkB receptors on Schwann cells. The expected downstream effect is that such activation would modulate Rho GTPase activity, thereby enhancing cytoskeletal regulation required for the proper clustering of paranodal CAM complexes such as NF155 and Caspr1. This clustering is critical for maintaining paranodal integrity and, by extension, the stability and function of myelinated peripheral nerves. The hypothesis additionally suggests that BNN-27, through its neuroprotective effects, will rescue electrophysiological deficits observed in rodent models of demyelination by promoting efficient remyelination and proper axon–glia interactions (Sleigh et al., 2023; Richner et al., 2014).

In assays designed to test this hypothesis, one would expect to observe enhanced expression of paranodal proteins (NF155 and Caspr1) and improved paranodal integrity by immunocytochemical and imaging techniques following treatment with BNN-27. Electrophysiological measures such as nerve conduction velocity should also improve as a consequence of more robust remyelination and paranodal organization. In peripheral nerve models, Schwann cells have been reported to express TrkB receptors, where BDNF is known to influence remyelination processes (Gupta et al., 2013; Fletcher et al., 2018). However, the direct effect of BNN-27 on Schwann cells has not been conclusively demonstrated. Some promising in vitro data from similar synthetic neurosteroid derivatives suggest that modifications can yield TrkB-selective analogs with efficacy in protecting neural cells from apoptosis and improving neurite outgrowth (Narducci et al., 2023). Yet, it is unclear whether BNN-27 itself will elicit a comparable effect on Schwann cells, particularly regarding Rho GTPase–driven cytoskeletal rearrangements and CAM clustering necessary for paranodal assembly (Forsell et al., 2024). Hence, while the expected pharmacodynamic effect is rational based on known roles of TrkB signaling in myelination, the direct translation of this mechanism to BNN-27 remains to be validated experimentally.

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating BNN-27 as a potential therapeutic candidate for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, several strengths and weaknesses become apparent based on the current literature review.

Among the strengths, BNN-27 benefits from a robust preclinical safety profile, having been shown to cross the blood–brain barrier and avoid hyperalgesic side effects that have hindered the use of native neurotrophins like NGF (Pediaditakis et al., 2016). Its synthetic origin renders it readily amenable to laboratory synthesis and potential chemical modification, which is beneficial for medicinal chemistry optimization. Additionally, the broader class of microneurotrophins has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in several CNS models, suggesting that similar mechanisms could be harnessed for peripheral nerve repair (Gravanis et al., 2017; Bennett et al., 2016). The concept of repurposing neurotrophin mimetics for enhancing myelination and paranodal assembly is well supported by literature demonstrating that neurotrophins and their receptors are crucial for maintaining myelin integrity and promoting nerve regeneration (Richner et al., 2014; Gupta et al., 2013).

However, the weaknesses of BNN-27 in this specific application are significant. First, the majority of the mechanistic evidence supports BNN-27’s selective activity on TrkA receptors rather than TrkB. As the hypothesis being evaluated for CMT specifically requires selective TrkB activation on Schwann cells, this discrepancy raises concerns about the direct applicability of BNN-27 for this indication (Pediaditakis et al., 2016). Second, while there is strong rationale in the literature that TrkB activation can mediate downstream Rho GTPase regulation leading to improved cytoskeletal dynamics and paranodal assembly, no direct experimental data presently show that BNN-27 can reproduce these effects in Schwann cells or in relevant CMT animal models (Sleigh et al., 2023). Another point of concern is that the broader association between NTRK2 (the gene encoding TrkB) and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease is weak, with genomic studies indicating only minimal direct evidence linking TrkB alterations to CMT pathogenesis (Ochoa et al., 2023). This suggests that even if BNN-27 could activate TrkB on Schwann cells, its impact on disease progression remains speculative without stronger genetic and mechanistic support. Moreover, while numerous clinical trials in CMT are exploring neurotrophin modulation—with many targeting TrkB and related pathways—the vast majority of these studies have not yet yielded definitive mechanistic insights or clinical endpoints directly attributable to TrkB agonism (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In conclusion, while BNN-27 is a promising compound within the class of synthetic neurosteroid derivatives and exhibits advantageous pharmacokinetic and safety properties, its current profile as a selective TrkA agonist severely challenges its repurposing as a TrkB agonist for peripheral demyelinating diseases such as CMT. The hypothesis that BNN-27 will enhance paranodal assembly by activating TrkB receptors on Schwann cells through downstream Rho GTPase regulation is attractive from a mechanistic standpoint. However, the existing literature does not provide sufficient biochemical or in vivo data to support this mechanism for BNN-27 in the context of Schwann cell biology. Further work is required to either chemically modify BNN-27 to improve its selectivity for TrkB or to generate definitive preclinical data demonstrating its ability to induce TrkB-mediated paranodal assembly, enhance expression and clustering of NF155 and Caspr1, and ultimately improve electrophysiological outcomes in demyelination models. Only with such data can we confirm whether BNN-27 or a derivative thereof holds promise for treating CMT via the proposed mechanism (Pediaditakis et al., 2016; Narducci et al., 2023; Forsell et al., 2024).

Overall, the strength of BNN-27 lies in its established safety, BBB permeability, and neuroprotective efficacy in CNS models, as well as its synthetic accessibility which permits further structural refinement. The primary weakness is the lack of evidence for TrkB agonism and consequent downstream effects on Schwann cell–mediated paranodal assembly, which are critical for its repurposing as a therapeutic in Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. In light of these considerations, it is recommended that additional studies be undertaken to rigorously test BNN-27’s effect on Schwann cells, including investigations into receptor subtype specificity, modulation of Rho GTPase signaling, and the ability to promote paranodal CAM clustering in relevant peripheral nerve models. Only with such data can we confirm whether BNN-27 or a derivative thereof holds promise for treating CMT via the proposed mechanism (Sleigh et al., 2023; Pediaditakis et al., 2016; Gupta et al., 2013).

Phlorizin (SGLT inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # P3692),"Proposal for Phlorizin (SGLT inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # P3692)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Phlorizin is a naturally occurring dihydrochalcone glucoside originally isolated from apple tree bark and apple peels. Historically, it was discovered in natural sources and characterized for its strong inhibitory effects on sodium–glucose cotransporters (SGLTs) (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 3–4). As a member of the SGLT inhibitor class, phlorizin acts by competitively binding to SGLT1 and SGLT2 with affinities several orders of magnitude higher than glucose. Its discovery formed the biochemical basis for the later development of synthetic and more selective gliflozins that have revolutionized the management of diabetes mellitus. Unlike many traditional small molecule drugs that are discovered through high-throughput screening, phlorizin’s origins lie in natural product research. It can be isolated from various parts of the apple tree and is now available from commercial suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich (catalog # P3692). The compound belongs to a class of plant-derived flavonoids that has been historically used as a research tool to elucidate the roles of SGLT-mediated glucose uptake in tissues such as the kidney and intestine (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 2–3). In its natural state, phlorizin is used less frequently in clinical settings because of its poor oral bioavailability, rapid hydrolysis to the aglycone phloretin, and nonspecific targeting. However, its robust inhibition of SGLTs has enabled extensive preclinical studies. Its molecular structure and mode of action have also informed modern medicinal chemistry campaigns aimed at developing improved analogs that offer enhanced pharmacokinetics and safety profiles. Thus, phlorizin represents a prototypical SGLT inhibitor whose pharmacology underpins a broader class of antidiabetic agents currently used in the management of type 2 diabetes (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 3–4; Habtemariam, 2023, pp. 1–2).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, phlorizin has been extensively studied as an antihyperglycemic agent. Early studies demonstrated that its intravenous administration in animal models induced renal glycosuria by significantly reducing glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 3–4). Its ability to lower plasma glucose levels by blocking SGLT1/2-mediated glucose uptake laid the groundwork for the development of selective SGLT2 inhibitors that are clinically approved today. In diabetic rodent models, phlorizin and its analogs have been shown to ameliorate hyperglycemia, normalize insulin sensitivity, and even reduce glucotoxicity-induced tissue damage (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 5–6). Despite these metabolic benefits, phlorizin itself has not been widely used in the clinic due to its unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties and the need for intravenous administration. Over the past several decades, the focus of SGLT inhibition research shifted to compounds such as empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin, which offer selective inhibition with oral bioavailability and improved safety profiles. Importantly, recent clinical and preclinical studies on SGLT inhibitors have expanded their potential impact beyond glycemic control, particularly in the realm of diabetic complications including neuropathy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 11–14). Although the majority of therapeutic applications for this class of drugs have been focused on diabetes and cardiovascular protection, there is emerging biochemical and preclinical evidence that suggests SGLT inhibitors may have neuroprotective effects. For instance, studies using empagliflozin in diabetic peripheral neuropathy have illustrated benefits such as improved nerve conduction velocity, reduced oxidative stress, and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways (Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 16–17). However, to date, no clinical trial has directly evaluated phlorizin for the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease or other inherited neuropathies. Instead, the utilization of phlorizin as a tool compound has helped establish a mechanistic rationale by which modulation of glucose uptake and subsequent metabolic adaptation may influence peripheral nerve biology, and in particular, the function of Schwann cells responsible for myelination (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 3–4). The historical data from diabetic models and SGLT inhibition studies in various tissues, including some reports on enteric neuronal recovery in obesity models (Shimo et al., 2020, pp. 8–9), provide indirect evidence that supports further evaluation of phlorizin in neurodegenerative conditions such as CMT.

Mechanism of Action:
The known mechanism of action of phlorizin is centered on its inhibition of sodium–glucose cotransporters (SGLT1 and SGLT2). SGLT1 is predominantly located in the small intestine and certain other tissues, whereas SGLT2 is primarily expressed in the renal proximal tubules. Phlorizin binds competitively to these transporters with an affinity that is 1,000 to 3,000 times greater than that of glucose itself, thereby blocking glucose uptake via sodium-dependent mechanisms (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 2–3; Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 3–4). This inhibition decreases intracellular glucose levels in target cells. In the context of Schwann cells, which are critical to peripheral nerve health and are implicated in the pathogenesis of CMT, elevated intracellular glucose may impair cellular metabolism and promote toxic downstream effects. By inhibiting glucose uptake, phlorizin is hypothesized to reduce the glucose-induced metabolic overload, thereby shifting the cellular energy balance. A reduction in glucose uptake can elevate the AMP/ATP ratio, which is a well-known trigger for activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK acts as a central energy sensor in cells, and its activation promotes autophagy—the cellular process by which misfolded proteins and damaged organelles are degraded and recycled (Habtemariam, 2023, pp. 20–21; Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 14–15). In Schwann cells, proper autophagic flux is crucial for the clearance of misfolded proteins, including aberrant forms of myelin proteins that impede the trafficking of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) essential for maintaining paranodal junction integrity. In vitro studies have shown that treatment of Schwann–dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co-cultures with phlorizin leads to an increase in the autophagy marker LC3-II, a reduction in aggregated myelin protein zero (MPZ), and an increase in membrane levels of NF155—a critical CAM implicated in paranodal stabilization (Li et al., 2020, pp. 28–29; Yon et al., 2023, pp. 16–17). Moreover, activation of AMPK not only enhances autophagic flux but also provides neuroprotective benefits by reducing oxidative stress and promoting mitochondrial health (Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 17–18; Yon et al., 2023, pp. 8–10). Thus, the proposed mechanism of phlorizin in CMT is multifaceted: it modulates cellular metabolism by inhibiting SGLT-mediated glucose uptake, triggers AMPK activation due to an increased AMP/ATP ratio, and consequently promotes autophagy-mediated clearance of misfolded proteins that disrupt CAM trafficking and paranodal junction integrity. This chain of events is anticipated to stabilize paranodal structures, improve nerve conduction, and ultimately ameliorate the clinical manifestations of CMT (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 5–6).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis and preliminary in vitro data, the expected effect of phlorizin in assays relevant to CMT involves a series of molecular and cellular events. In the proposed Schwann cell–DRG co-culture systems, phlorizin is anticipated to reduce SGLT-mediated glucose uptake in Schwann cells, thereby elevating their intracellular AMP/ATP ratio. This metabolic shift leads to the activation of AMPK, as indicated by increased levels of phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK) in experimental models (Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Habtemariam, 2023, pp. 20–21). The activated AMPK, in turn, enhances autophagic flux, demonstrated by increased conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and decreased levels of p62, a marker of impaired autophagy (Yon et al., 2023, pp. 16–17; Li et al., 2020, pp. 25–26). Enhanced autophagy is critical for clearing misfolded proteins, including mutant forms of MPZ, which can accumulate in Schwann cells in various CMT subtypes. The clearance of these protein aggregates should restore normal trafficking and surface expression of cell adhesion molecules such as NF155 and others that are required for proper paranodal junction formation and maintenance (Li et al., 2020, pp. 28–29). More specifically, in vitro data have indicated that phlorizin treatment increases membrane localization of NF155 and reduces aggregated MPZ, thereby suggesting that paranodal junction integrity can be restored (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In vivo, in animal models of CMT1A or other demyelinating neuropathies, phlorizin treatment is expected to lead to improved nerve conduction velocity, reduced demyelination, and normalization of nodal ultrastructure. Preclinical data from related SGLT inhibitors used in diabetic neuropathy models have shown improvements in nerve conduction and histopathological features, supporting the translation of these findings to CMT models (Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 18–19; Shimo et al., 2020, pp. 8–9). Importantly, phlorizin’s ability to modulate energy metabolism and reduce glucotoxicity may also help stabilize Schwann cell function, promoting not only the clearance of misfolded proteins but also the overall health and survival of these glial cells. Collectively, the expected effect in both in vitro and in vivo settings is an improvement in paranodal junction stability via enhanced autophagic clearance of pathological protein aggregates, restoration of CAM trafficking, and ultimately improved peripheral nerve function in models of CMT (Li et al., 2020, pp. 28–29; Yon et al., 2023, pp. 16–17).

Overall Evaluation:
The evaluation of phlorizin as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease produces several compelling strengths as well as notable challenges. Among the strengths, phlorizin’s well-characterized mechanism of action as a potent SGLT inhibitor establishes a robust biochemical foundation. Its capacity to block glucose uptake and thereby modulate cellular energy balance is well documented, and the downstream activation of AMPK appears to be a logical consequence of this inhibition (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 3–4; Habtemariam, 2023, pp. 20–21). AMPK activation is known to stimulate autophagic flux, a process critical for clearing misfolded proteins that, when accumulated, interfere with the trafficking of cell adhesion molecules necessary for paranodal junction maintenance (Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 14–15; Yon et al., 2023, pp. 16–17). This connection between metabolism and proteostasis offers an innovative avenue for addressing a key pathological feature of CMT that is not adequately targeted by current therapies. Moreover, the low toxicity of phlorizin demonstrated in various preclinical models, along with known pharmacokinetic data, supports its feasibility as a tool compound in further investigations (Yamaguchi et al., 2011, p. 7; Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, p. 8).

However, there are notable weaknesses and gaps in the current data. First and foremost, despite the promising mechanistic rationale based on studies in diabetic and other neuropathy models, very little direct evidence exists regarding the use of phlorizin or its analogs in models of CMT. Most of the available literature focuses on its antidiabetic and renal protective effects rather than on the direct modulation of Schwann cell biology in the context of inherited demyelinating diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 3–4). Although preliminary in vitro studies have indicated that phlorizin may enhance autophagy (as measured by LC3-II upregulation) and improve membrane localization of key proteins like NF155, these data are limited and require replication in robust, disease-relevant animal models of CMT (Li et al., 2020, pp. 28–29; Yon et al., 2023, pp. 16–17). Additionally, while the hypothesis that reduced glucose uptake in Schwann cells leads to AMPK activation is well supported in other cell types, direct measurements of AMP/ATP ratios and p-AMPK levels in Schwann cells following phlorizin treatment in a CMT context remain sparse. This represents an important gap in our understanding that should be addressed through dedicated biochemical and pharmacodynamic studies.

Another potential concern is the inherent pharmacokinetic limitation of phlorizin as a natural product. Its poor oral bioavailability and rapid hydrolysis to phloretin could limit its systemic exposure and, by extension, its therapeutic efficacy in peripheral nerves. This challenge might be overcome by chemical modification or formulation strategies, but such efforts will require further investment and research (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 2–3; Habtemariam, 2023, pp. 1–2). In addition, the complexity of CMT pathology—which is often caused by specific mutations in structural proteins such as MPZ—means that improvements in metabolic regulation and autophagy may only address part of the disease mechanism (Veneri, 2020, pp. 63–69). Thus, while the approach of stabilizing paranodal junctions by promoting autophagic clearance is innovative, it may need to be combined with other therapeutic strategies to achieve meaningful clinical outcomes in CMT patients.

Furthermore, many of the promising results regarding AMPK activation and autophagy induction are derived from studies on SGLT2 inhibitors such as empagliflozin, which have been shown to mitigate diabetic neuropathy independent of glycemic control (Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 11–14; Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 18–19). The extrapolation of these effects to phlorizin is reasonable given its role as the prototype SGLT inhibitor, yet caution is warranted because differences in selectivity and pharmacokinetics may result in different outcomes in the context of peripheral nerve repair. There is also a lack of clinical data—both in terms of safety and efficacy—specifically in the context of CMT; almost all existing human data for the SGLT inhibitor class are in diabetic populations (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Thus, while the preclinical data are encouraging, they must be interpreted within the limitations of current models.

In summary, phlorizin presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of CMT due to its well-established inhibitory action on SGLT transporters, which can modulate cellular glucose uptake, leading to a favorable shift in energy homeostasis that activates AMPK. The resulting activation of autophagy could clear misfolded proteins that otherwise impede the trafficking of cell adhesion molecules critical for paranodal junction integrity. Strengths of the candidate include its established biochemical mechanism, supportive preclinical data in diabetic neuropathy models, and low toxicity profile observed in various studies (Ehrenkranz et al., 2005, pp. 3–4; Abdelkader et al., 2022, pp. 16–17; Yon et al., 2023, pp. 8–10). However, significant weaknesses exist, including the lack of direct evidence in CMT models, challenges related to pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, and the multifactorial nature of CMT pathogenesis that may limit the sole efficacy of metabolic modulation approaches. Overall, while phlorizin’s novel link between metabolic regulation and proteostasis offers a unique strategy for nodal repair in CMT, additional focused studies in Schwann cell cultures and relevant animal models are essential before committing to clinical trials. This comprehensive evaluation suggests that phlorizin is a viable candidate for further investigation, provided that its pharmacokinetic limitations are addressed and that its mechanism of action in Schwann cells is rigorously validated in the context of CMT neuropathy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Li et al., 2020, pp. 28–29; Yon et al., 2023, pp. 16–17).

Pevonedistat (MLN4924; Cayman Chemical catalog # 20701),"Proposal for Pevonedistat (MLN4924; Cayman Chemical catalog # 20701)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pevonedistat (also known as MLN4924 and sold under Cayman Chemical catalog #20701) is a fully synthetic, small‐molecule inhibitor that belongs to the class of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitors. This compound was identified through extensive high‐throughput screening efforts aimed at targeting the neddylation pathway—a key regulatory cascade that controls the activity of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) involved in protein degradation—and was subsequently optimized chemically for potency and selectivity (Bhatia et al., 2016). As a member of the NAE inhibitor class, Pevonedistat possesses a unique mechanism of action that differentiates it from more classically employed proteasome inhibitors; whereas traditional agents such as bortezomib broadly affect the ubiquitin–proteasome system, NAE inhibitors like Pevonedistat specifically block the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like molecule NEDD8 to target proteins, particularly the cullins, thereby indirectly modulating protein turnover (Bhatia et al., 2016). Its chemical synthesis and subsequent formulation have been optimized for systemic administration, with early studies employing intravenous dosing in oncology settings, and the compound has been rigorously characterized from a medicinal chemistry standpoint (Bhatia et al., 2016). The fact that Pevonedistat is a synthetic molecule also allows for precise control over its chemical structure, which is essential for achieving selective inhibition of NAE while reducing off-target effects that could compromise safety (Bhatia et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Pevonedistat has been explored extensively in the oncology arena, where its ability to inhibit the neddylation pathway has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest, DNA re‐replication stress, apoptosis, and even autophagy in several tumor cell types (Bhatia et al., 2016). Preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma, and various lymphomas, and it has also been tested in solid tumors such as metastatic melanoma and nonhematologic cancers; indeed, early clinical trials such as those identified by NCT00677170 and NCT01415765 have focused on dose-escalation and safety assessments with promising signs of target engagement and antitumor activity (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 2008; National Cancer Institute, 2011). In these studies, patients received Pevonedistat on defined dosing schedules, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were well characterized; plasma profiling revealed dose-proportional exposure and a relatively short elimination half-life, while pharmacodynamic biomarkers (including increases in CDT-1 and NRF-2 transcripts) confirmed inhibition of NAE signaling (Bhatia et al., 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Despite its extensive evaluation in oncology, there is no documented history of its use in treating Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) or similar peripheral neuropathies; indeed, the majority of clinical data involving Pevonedistat has been generated from studies in cancer patients, with no direct clinical evidence supporting its use in neuropathic or demyelinating conditions (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 2008; National Cancer Institute, 2011). Nevertheless, preclinical investigations into the role of neddylation in Schwann cell biology, particularly those by Ayuso-García et al., have highlighted that inhibition of neddylation can severely compromise Schwann cell differentiation and myelination, thereby underscoring the need for careful evaluation of dosing and context when repurposing an agent like Pevonedistat for neuropathy (Ayuso-García et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
Pevonedistat exerts its biological effects by selectively inhibiting the NEDD8-activating enzyme, a critical enzyme required for the initiation of the neddylation process. In normal cellular physiology, NAE catalyzes the activation of NEDD8 by forming a high-energy NEDD8-AMP intermediate, which is then transferred to a series of E2 conjugating enzymes before being ligated, via E3 ligases, onto substrate proteins such as the cullins. Cullin neddylation is essential for the assembly and activity of CRL complexes, which mediate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of various short-lived regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal dynamics (Shah et al., 2016). By preventing the conjugation of NEDD8 to cullins, Pevonedistat causes the inactivation of CRL complexes, resulting in the accumulation of their substrates. Among these substrates are several proteins that regulate the turnover of Rho GTPase regulators and components of the endocytic machinery; these proteins are critical for actin cytoskeleton remodeling and the trafficking of membrane proteins, including those required for the maintenance of paranodal junctions in myelinated nerves (Ayuso-García et al., 2024). Notably, the stabilization of key cytoskeletal regulators could favor the proper delivery and surface expression of cell adhesion molecules such as Neurofascin-155, which plays a pivotal role in the assembly and maintenance of paranodal junctions (Ayuso-García et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Molecule-level studies have further shown that Pevonedistat forms a covalent adduct with NEDD8 when bound to NAE, effectively “trapping” the enzyme in an inactive state and leading to the downstream effects mentioned above (Shah et al., 2016). Thus, while the predominant focus of published work has been on its application in oncology, the biochemical action of Pevonedistat is mechanistically relevant to the regulation of protein turnover in Schwann cells—a system that, when dysregulated, may contribute to features of CMT pathology (Bhatia et al., 2016).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis under consideration, Pevonedistat is expected to promote paranodal junction integrity in models of CMT by stabilizing CRL substrates that are crucial for cytoskeletal regulation and trafficking in Schwann cells. In CMT, defects in Schwann cell myelination and paranodal junction assembly result in destabilization of the membrane and impaired nerve conduction; these deficits are thought to arise, at least in part, from aberrant protein turnover and mislocalization of key cell adhesion molecules (Ayuso-García et al., 2024). The proposed mechanism suggests that by inhibiting NAE, Pevonedistat will lead to a reduced turnover of Rho-GEFs and other trafficking adaptors, thereby promoting a more stable actin cytoskeleton. A robust actin network is essential for the trafficking and targeted membrane delivery of paranodal cell adhesion molecules such as Neurofascin-155, a protein expressed in Schwann cells that is integral to the formation and maintenance of paranodal junctions (Ayuso-García et al., 2024). In proposed dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co-culture assays, treatment with Pevonedistat is hypothesized to increase the surface expression of neurofascin and other paranodal cell adhesion molecules, resulting in enhanced paranodal junction formation and improved myelination (Ayuso-García et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preliminary pharmacokinetic studies in rodent models have indicated that Pevonedistat achieves measurable exposure in peripheral nerves, which is encouraging for its repurposing in a neuropathy context where localized drug levels in the nerve tissue are critical for therapeutic efficacy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, past oncology trials have provided a safety profile that, despite some dose-limiting toxicities observed at higher concentrations, suggests that controlled dosing regimens may be achievable in non-cancer patients if retargeted appropriately (Bhatia et al., 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
In our comprehensive literature review, Pevonedistat emerges as a promising yet challenging candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. One of the foremost strengths of Pevonedistat lies in its novel mechanism of action; by specifically targeting the NAE, it offers a unique means of modulating the neddylation pathway and thereby stabilizing proteins that are otherwise subject to rapid turnover by CRL complexes (Shah et al., 2016; Bhatia et al., 2016). This mechanism is particularly appealing in CMT, where dysregulation in the turnover of cytoskeletal regulators and trafficking components may underpin defects in paranodal junction formation and myelination (Ayuso-García et al., 2024). In controlled preclinical settings—such as DRG-Schwann cell co-cultures—there is a strong rationale to test whether Pevonedistat can indeed increase the surface levels of critical membrane proteins like Neurofascin-155, thereby reinforcing paranodal junction integrity and promoting more effective myelination (Ayuso-García et al., 2024).

Another significant advantage is the relatively extensive clinical history of Pevonedistat in oncology. The drug has been through several Phase I studies in cancer patients (e.g., Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 2008; National Cancer Institute, 2011; Bhatia et al., 2016), where its pharmacokinetic profile, dose-proportional exposure, and target engagement have been well documented. This body of data could potentially accelerate repurposing efforts by providing a solid foundation regarding safety and human pharmacokinetics, although it should be noted that the concentration ranges and dosing schedules optimized for cancer treatment might differ markedly from those required to achieve therapeutic benefit in a neuropathic context (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 2008; Bhatia et al., 2016).

Despite these strengths, several caveats must be carefully considered. Some of the preclinical literature, notably by Ayuso-García et al., indicates that inhibition of neddylation in Schwann cells can lead to impaired myelination and peripheral nerve dysfunction if not precisely calibrated (Ayuso-García et al., 2024). This suggests that a complete or excessive blockade of the neddylation pathway in Schwann cells may exacerbate rather than ameliorate the myelination defects characteristic of CMT. The hypothesis proposes that a controlled, titrated inhibition could instead stabilize specific CRL substrates—including regulators of actin dynamics and endocytic trafficking—that are beneficial for maintaining paranodal integrity. However, establishing the correct dosing window where beneficial effects are observed without inducing deleterious outcomes will be critical. There is a fine line between the desired stabilization of cytoskeletal regulators and the unintended blockade of essential proliferative or differentiation signals in Schwann cells (Ayuso-García et al., 2024).

Moreover, while pharmacokinetic studies in rodents have provided preliminary evidence of peripheral nerve exposure, these findings need to be corroborated in additional preclinical models that mimic the human pathology of CMT. Detailed assessments of drug distribution, particularly in the peripheral nervous system, will be essential to ascertain whether therapeutically useful concentrations of Pevonedistat can be achieved without systemic toxicity (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, the potential for off-target effects remains a concern. Because neddylation regulates a broad range of cellular processes, systemic inhibition could disrupt functions in other tissues, leading to unintended side effects. A comprehensive safety evaluation will be necessary to determine if the benefits of improved paranodal junction integrity outweigh the risks associated with global inhibition of neddylation (Bhatia et al., 2016).

Another area of uncertainty is whether the molecular targets implicated in the hypothesis—specifically, the stabilization of Rho GTPase regulators and trafficking proteins that govern Neurofascin-155 targeting—are indeed the critical nodes that can be modulated by Pevonedistat in a clinically meaningful way in CMT patients. While there is a theoretical basis for this mechanism, further molecular studies are required to validate that these specific CRL substrates are altered in CMT and that their stabilization leads to measurable improvements in paranodal junction architecture and nerve conduction (Ayuso-García et al., 2024). Preclinical data from DRG co-culture systems will be essential in demonstrating that Pevonedistat treatment results in a quantitative increase in surface levels of paranodal cell adhesion molecules and that this correlates with functional recovery in nerve conduction assays.

In summary, Pevonedistat represents an innovative therapeutic candidate with a mechanism of action that is uniquely poised to influence protein turnover in Schwann cells—a cellular process that is critical for the maintenance of paranodal junctions in peripheral nerves. Its extensive clinical history in oncology offers a valuable repository of safety and pharmacokinetic data which could be leveraged during repurposing efforts. However, the challenge lies in achieving the right balance of neddylation inhibition to promote cytoskeletal stabilization and proper trafficking of paranodal components without inducing adverse effects on overall Schwann cell function and myelination. The promising hypothesis—that Pevonedistat will promote paranodal junction integrity by stabilizing key regulators of actin dynamics and membrane protein trafficking—is supported by biochemical principles and preliminary preclinical studies in related cell types (Ayuso-García et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nonetheless, the contradictory evidence suggesting that excessive neddylation inhibition impairs myelination necessitates a cautious and methodical experimental approach. Future work should focus on dose-ranging studies in relevant in vitro and in vivo models of CMT to precisely delineate the therapeutic window in which Pevonedistat exerts beneficial effects on paranodal junctions while preserving overall Schwann cell viability and function (Ayuso-García et al., 2024; Bhatia et al., 2016). Furthermore, it will be crucial to identify and validate biomarkers that can monitor target engagement specifically in the peripheral nervous system, thereby ensuring that the pharmacodynamic effects observed in oncology studies are recapitulated in the context of neuropathy.

Overall, while Pevonedistat holds promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease based on its novel mechanism of modulating protein turnover and its potential to stabilize cytoskeletal and trafficking regulators in Schwann cells, significant concerns remain that must be addressed through rigorous preclinical testing. Its well-established pharmacokinetic and safety profile in oncology is an asset; however, whether these parameters translate to a favorable risk-benefit profile in CMT is far from confirmed. The strengths of this candidate lie in its unique mechanism that targets a fundamental cellular process and the availability of extensive clinical data from cancer trials, which could accelerate its repurposing. The weaknesses include the possibility of exacerbating demyelination if neddylation is overly inhibited and the need for precise dosing strategies to avoid interfering with essential Schwann cell functions. In conclusion, Pevonedistat is a candidate with strong scientific rationale that warrants further investigation in preclinical models of CMT, with careful attention to dosing, target validation, and the identification of peripheral nerve-specific biomarkers. Only through such a comprehensive evaluation can its potential for promoting paranodal junction integrity and improving clinical outcomes in CMT be accurately assessed (Ayuso-García et al., 2024; Bhatia et al., 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Tetrandrine (calcium channel blocker; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # T0550),"Proposal for Tetrandrine (calcium channel blocker; Sigma-Aldrich catalog # T0550)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tetrandrine is a bis‐benzylisoquinoline alkaloid originally isolated from the dried roots of Stephania tetrandra. As a naturally derived compound, it was discovered through traditional medicine research and later characterized chemically and pharmacologically. Tetrandrine belongs to the class of calcium channel blockers that also exhibit BK channel modulation properties. Historically, this compound has been investigated for its anti‐inflammatory, anti‐fibrotic, and immunosuppressive activities, as well as its potential in treating hypertension, certain cancers, and silicosis (Nardi & Olesen, 2008). Its chemical structure and multi‐target profile allow it to modulate ion channels and associated intracellular signaling pathways. This class of compounds is generally known for their ability to inhibit Ca²⁺ entry, thereby affecting cellular processes that are sensitive to intracellular calcium fluctuations. Consequently, tetrandrine’s pharmacological profile makes it an attractive candidate for repurposing by targeting Ca²⁺‐dependent pathologies, including those where aberrant calcium handling triggers downstream proteolytic cascades.

Therapeutic History:
Tetrandrine’s therapeutic history is notable in both preclinical and limited clinical settings—primarily in the areas of oncology, cardiovascular disease, and inflammatory conditions. A number of studies have investigated its role as an anti‐fibrotic agent and calcium channel modulator. However, when it comes to neurological disorders, particularly peripheral demyelinating conditions such as Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease, the literature is notably sparse. A direct search of the ClinicalTrials.gov database using terms that combine tetrandrine with “Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth,” “demyelinating neuropathy,” “nerve conduction,” or “Schwann cell” yields zero registered clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Das, 2016). Similarly, classic preclinical studies or published animal data linking tetrandrine to improved nodal or paranodal function in CMT models are not present in the available literature (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Das, 2016). In essence, while the therapeutic class of calcium channel blockers has been extensively explored in various clinical contexts, tetrandrine itself has not been evaluated in clinical or widely recognized preclinical studies specifically targeting the pathological mechanisms of CMT or analogous demyelinating neuropathies. Thus, its use for CMT remains a novel hypothesis rather than one backed by an established historical record.

Mechanism of Action:
Tetrandrine’s known mechanism of action revolves around its ability to block L‐type calcium channels, thereby reducing the influx of Ca²⁺ into cells. This action has been documented by studies employing techniques such as fura‐2 imaging to demonstrate reduced calcium uptake in cellular models (Nardi & Olesen, 2008). In many cell types, including cells with excitable membranes, the reduced Ca²⁺ entry can dampen downstream activation of several calcium‐dependent processes. One of these key downstream effectors is calpain, a calcium‐dependent cysteine protease which, when activated, leads to proteolysis of critical intracellular and membrane‐associated proteins. In the context of Schwann cells, which are responsible for the formation and maintenance of myelin in the peripheral nervous system, elevated intracellular Ca²⁺ under stress or injury conditions has been implicated in the activation of calpain. Calpain, in turn, degrades components of the paranodal septate junction complex—specifically adhesion molecules such as Neurofascin 155 (NF155), Caspr1, and Contactin‐1—which are essential for maintaining the structure and function of nodes of Ranvier (Pan & Chan, 2017). The proposed hypothesis is that by blocking L‐type calcium channels, tetrandrine would reduce intracellular Ca²⁺ levels in Schwann cells, thereby preventing calpain activation and subsequent degradation of these critical adhesion complexes. This mechanism is supported by general literature on Ca²⁺‐dependent calpain activation and the resulting disruption of paranodal architecture; however, it is important to note that there is no direct biochemical evidence in the current context that demonstrates tetrandrine’s effect on these specific proteins in CMT models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Pan & Chan, 2017).

At the molecular level, calcium channel blockers modulate transmembrane ion currents by interfering with the opening of voltage‐gated calcium channels. In a stressed or injured Schwann cell, voltage‐gated calcium channels are activated, leading to an influx of Ca²⁺ ions. This increased Ca²⁺ concentration can trigger calpain activation—a process that affects not only cytoskeletal elements but also membrane‐associated proteins critical to the paranode integrity. The preservation of the paranodal junctions is crucial since these structures underpin the maintenance of proper axonal conduction by ensuring the proper segregation of sodium and potassium channels along the axon (Das, 2016; Moss et al., 2021). In this light, tetrandrine’s biochemical activity as a calcium channel blocker may indirectly contribute to the preservation of paranodal complexes. Although the existing literature on calcium influx in demyelinating neuropathies underscores the role of calpain‐mediated degradation, empirical evidence demonstrating that tetrandrine specifically inhibits calpain‐induced cleavage of NF155, Caspr1, or Contactin‐1 in Schwann cells or in PMP22 rodent models is not available in the current body of evidence (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Das, 2016).

Expected Effect:
Under the proposed hypothesis, tetrandrine is expected to exert a neuroprotective effect on peripheral nerve fibers in CMT by enhancing paranodal septate junction formation. Specifically, the expected cascade of events is as follows: In stressed Schwann cells (which are documented to play a pivotal role in maintaining axonal integrity and nodal architecture in demyelinating neuropathies such as CMT), elevated intracellular calcium triggers calpain activation, leading to proteolysis of key junctional proteins (Moss et al., 2021; Pan & Chan, 2017). By reducing Ca²⁺ influx via blockade of L‐type calcium channels, tetrandrine is hypothesized to prevent the activation of calpain. This should result in decreased cleavage of CAMs (cell adhesion molecules) involved in the paranodal complex, including NF155, Caspr1, and Contactin‐1. Such preservation of the paranodal architecture is critical because these proteins are responsible for anchoring the myelin sheath to the axon and for maintaining the high fidelity of saltatory conduction—which is compromised in CMT (Das, 2016; Pan & Chan, 2017).

In vitro assays using PMP22‐overexpressing Schwann cell cultures are anticipated to show that treatment with tetrandrine results in increased paranodal immunostaining, indicating a preserved or enhanced paranodal junction formation. Enhanced immunostaining of markers such as NF155, Caspr1, and Contactin‐1 would correlate with improved nodal architecture, which is essential for maintaining conduction velocity and overall nerve function. Furthermore, animal models of CMT might demonstrate a restoration of nerve conduction velocity upon tetrandrine treatment, aligning with the hypothesis that inhibiting calcium influx and subsequent calpain activation will protect or restore paranodal function (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Das, 2016). It should be emphasized, however, that although there is a solid theoretical basis derived from general studies on calcium dysregulation in demyelinating conditions (Pan & Chan, 2017), direct experimental data on tetrandrine’s efficacy in these specific cellular or animal models remains absent from the literature as currently available.

Overall Evaluation:
Evaluating tetrandrine as a repurposed candidate for the treatment of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth Disease involves balancing theoretical promise with the current gaps in direct experimental evidence. On the positive side, the compound’s mechanism—as a calcium channel blocker that potentially reduces calpain‐mediated proteolysis—addresses a mechanistically plausible target in CMT pathology. Since dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and subsequent calpain activation have both been implicated in the degradation of paranodal junction proteins, tetrandrine’s ability to mitigate these processes could offer a novel therapeutic avenue (Pan & Chan, 2017; Nardi & Olesen, 2008). The distinct mechanism of action of tetrandrine, when compared to more traditional sodium channel blockers that have been evaluated for neuroprotection in demyelinating diseases (O’Malley, 2009), provides an alternative strategy by targeting a different node of the pathophysiological cascade.

However, several weaknesses must also be considered. The literature searches show that no registered clinical trials or clear preclinical studies have evaluated tetrandrine in the context of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease, demyelinating neuropathies, or even broad‐assessment of nerve conduction in relation to Schwann cell function (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, while the theoretical mechanism—reduction of Ca²⁺ influx leading to decreased calpain activation—is compelling, direct evidence demonstrating that tetrandrine can specifically prevent the proteolytic degradation of proteins such as NF155, Caspr1, or Contactin‐1 in relevant cell types is lacking (Das, 2016; Pan & Chan, 2017). Additionally, the non‐neurological therapeutic history of tetrandrine suggests that its pharmacokinetics, off‐target effects, and general toxicity have been evaluated in other disease contexts but not thoroughly in peripheral nerve models or in chronic applications required for a slowly progressive disease such as CMT.

Given the absence of direct experimental studies—either in PMP22‐overexpressing Schwann cell cultures or in animal models of CMT—the current evidence base supports only a hypothesis. The proposed preclinical studies are therefore critical: Detailed in vitro analyses using Schwann cell cultures and subsequent in vivo studies with established CMT rodent models are necessary to validate the putative mechanism. Comprehensive studies should include fura‐2 imaging to confirm reductions in intracellular Ca²⁺, concomitant measurements of calpain activity, and immunoassays to quantify paranodal protein levels before and after treatment with tetrandrine (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Das, 2016).

In summary, while tetrandrine is a promising therapeutic candidate based on its known role as a calcium channel blocker and its potential to prevent calpain‐mediated degradation of paranodal junction proteins, the candidate’s application in Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth Disease has not yet been directly supported by preclinical or clinical studies. Its strengths lie in the innovative mechanism that targets calcium‐dependent proteolysis—a process well established in demyelinating neuropathies—whereas its weaknesses revolve around the lack of direct empirical evidence in CMT models and the uncertainty regarding its long‐term safety and efficacy in a neurological setting. The future direction should include rigorous in vitro and in vivo evaluations to determine whether the theoretical benefits of tetrandrine translate into meaningful therapeutic outcomes for CMT patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Nardi & Olesen, 2008; Pan & Chan, 2017; Das, 2016; Moss et al., 2021).

Overall, the scientific rationale for repurposing tetrandrine in CMT is compelling from a mechanistic standpoint, yet the significant gap in direct preclinical data necessitates a cautious approach. It is recommended that the drug development team prioritize detailed preclinical investigations to establish pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles in neural tissues, along with safety assessments in relevant models, before progressing to clinical evaluation in patients with Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth Disease.
