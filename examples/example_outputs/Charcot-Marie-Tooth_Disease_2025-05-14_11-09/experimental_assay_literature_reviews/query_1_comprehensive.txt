Query: Comprehensive mechanisms by which PMP22 gene dosage imbalances, MPZ mutations, GJB1 defects and MFN2 alterations drive Schwann cell pathology, demyelination, axonal degeneration in CMT; upstream regulators, signaling pathways, cellular stress responses, calcium homeostasis.

PMP22 gene dosage imbalances are fundamental to the pathogenesis of CMT. In CMT1A, duplication of the PMP22 gene results in overexpression of this 22‐kDa tetraspan glycoprotein, which is essential for myelin compaction. Overexpression disrupts Schwann cell differentiation by destabilizing the myelin sheath and altering intracellular signaling pathways such as PI3K‐Akt and MEK‐ERK, which are critical for proper myelination. Excessive PMP22 also leads to protein misfolding and aggregate formation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), triggering ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR), ultimately resulting in Schwann cell apoptosis and secondary axonal degeneration (benoy2015charcotmarietoothdiseaseand pages 283-286, murakami2019schwanncelland pages 4-7).

MPZ mutations impair the function of myelin protein zero, a critical adhesion molecule required for the integrity of compact myelin. Mutations in MPZ disrupt its extracellular domain responsible for homophilic binding, leading to defective adhesion among myelin wraps. The resulting misfolding of MPZ proteins commonly causes their accumulation in the ER, activating stress-response pathways and the UPR that culminate in Schwann cell dysfunction and demyelination. Disrupted MPZ function further disturbs Schwann cell–axon interactions, contributing to axonal loss (benoy2015charcotmarietoothdiseaseand pages 283-286, estevezarias2022geneticapproachesand pages 11-13).

Defects in GJB1, which encodes connexin 32 (Cx32), compromise gap junction formation in non-compact myelin regions. These gap junctions are responsible for ionic and metabolic communication between Schwann cell layers. GJB1 mutations typically result in nonfunctional channels or mislocalization of Cx32, blocking the radial diffusion of ions and small metabolites essential for maintaining myelin and axonal integrity. This breakdown in coupling not only disrupts cellular homeostasis and calcium signaling but also predisposes Schwann cells to metabolic and ionic stress, thereby contributing to demyelination and subsequent axonal degeneration (estevezarias2022geneticapproachesand pages 9-11, boutary2019developmentofa pages 107-108).

MFN2 is critical for mitochondrial fusion and proper maintenance of the mitochondrial network, both of which are essential for Schwann cell energy metabolism and axonal support. Mutations in MFN2 impair mitochondrial dynamics and disturb the tethering between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, which is crucial for calcium exchange and homeostasis. The resulting mitochondrial dysfunction leads to impaired oxidative phosphorylation, energy deficits, and an accumulation of reactive oxygen species, all of which instigate axonal degeneration. Additionally, the disrupted ER-mitochondria contacts interfere with store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), leading to abnormal calcium signaling that further exacerbates both Schwann cell and axonal pathology (estevezarias2022geneticapproachesand pages 18-20, shackleford2022anewmouse pages 31-32).

Upstream regulators and signaling pathways play a significant role in modulating these processes. Transcription factors such as EGR2 and Krox-20 regulate the expression of key myelin proteins (including PMP22 and MPZ), and their dysregulation can further perturb myelination. Neuregulin-1, via activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, is critical for Schwann cell differentiation, and its signaling may be adversely affected by PMP22 overexpression. Moreover, integrin-mediated signaling and Rho-dependent pathways, which influence Schwann cell adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics, become dysregulated in response to altered PMP22 levels (boutary2019developmentofa pages 24-27, murakami2019schwanncelland pages 4-7).

Cellular stress responses are integral to the pathology as well. Both PMP22 and MPZ mutations induce ER stress through protein misfolding and aggregation, activating the UPR and, in some contexts, triggering apoptosis. In parallel, MFN2-associated mitochondrial dysfunction provokes oxidative stress and disrupts calcium homeostasis, further impairing cellular function. Additionally, GJB1 defects compromise the regulation of intracellular calcium due to faulty gap junction communication, thereby exacerbating the metabolic and ionic imbalance in Schwann cells (morena2019charcotmarietoothfrommolecules pages 4-6, estevezarias2022geneticapproachesand pages 17-18, jerath2015hereditarymotorand pages 3-4).

Collectively, the interplay of PMP22 gene dosage imbalances, MPZ mutations, GJB1 defects, and MFN2 alterations drives a multifaceted cascade of Schwann cell pathology. Disrupted signaling pathways, cellular stress responses, and deranged calcium homeostasis converge to compromise myelin maintenance, leading to demyelination and secondary axonal degeneration characteristic of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (benoy2015charcotmarietoothdiseaseand pages 283-286, estevezarias2022geneticapproachesand pages 7-9, murakami2019schwanncelland pages 1-4).
