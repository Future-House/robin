Query: Mechanistic insights into ER stress, unfolded protein response, proteasomal degradation and autophagy pathways in CMT Schwann cells; cross-talk with mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, ROS generation, calcium signaling, and potential rescue biomarkers for cell-based assay readouts.

The current evidence indicates that Schwann cell pathology in Charcot‐Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease arises from an intricate interplay between ER stress pathways—including the unfolded protein response (UPR), proteasomal degradation, and autophagy—and mitochondrial dysfunction, which encompasses impaired dynamics, defective mitophagy, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and disturbed calcium signaling.

First, when misfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of Schwann cells, they trigger ER stress and concomitant activation of the UPR. This response attempts to restore proteostasis by upregulating chaperones and, in cases of overwhelming stress, initiating apoptotic signaling mediated by factors such as CHOP. In CMT, misfolded myelin proteins (for example, in CMT1 linked to P0S63del) or dysfunctional proteins secondary to MFN2 mutations (which underlie CMT2A) can initiate such a UPR cascade, linking ER stress directly to Schwann cell dysfunction and demyelination (hameren2018mitochondrialphysiologywithin pages 61-63).

Subsequent to UPR activation, the proteasomal degradation pathway is mobilized to clear the misfolded proteins. However, when the load of defective or unfolded proteins surpasses the proteasome’s capacity, there is a compensatory activation of autophagy. Autophagy—both non-selective macroautophagy and selective forms such as mitophagy—is crucial for removing protein aggregates and dysfunctional organelles, particularly damaged mitochondria. Key autophagic markers, such as p62/SQSTM1 and Beclin 1, emerge as candidate indicators of autophagic flux and are potential rescue biomarkers for interventions aimed at restoring homeostasis (finkbeiner2020theautophagylysosomal pages 12-12).

Mitochondrial dynamics constitute another critical axis in CMT pathology. Mutations in MFN2 disrupt mitochondrial fusion, leading to fragmented, mislocalized mitochondria. These mitochondria exhibit an abnormal decoupling of ATP production and ROS generation—while ATP upregulation in response to elevated energy demands is impaired, ROS levels remain high, contributing to oxidative damage. This imbalance can further exacerbate ER stress by perpetuating protein misfolding and directly interfere with cellular signaling (hameren2018mitochondrialphysiologywithin pages 134-140).

The cross‐talk between the ER and mitochondria is facilitated by mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which ensure calcium transfer between these organelles—a process vital for proper mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In CMT Schwann cells, defective ER–mitochondria interplay, as seen with MFN2 mutations, impairs this calcium signaling. The resultant dysregulation not only diminishes the mitochondria’s energetic output but also promotes additional ROS production, further fueling cellular stress (hameren2018mitochondrialphysiologywithin pages 194-196).

Complementing these observations, the activation of mitophagy—mediated by regulators like Parkin and ULK1—serves to remove the faulty mitochondria. Functional assays monitoring mitochondrial ATP, ROS, and calcium flux with genetically encoded sensors have been proposed as effective readouts for evaluating mitochondrial health. Such readouts, combined with measures of mitochondrial morphology and transport, represent viable rescue biomarkers for cell-based assays (hameren2018mitochondrialphysiologywithin pages 192-194).

Finally, the integration of these pathways points toward a strategy for developing multiplexed biomarkers. These could include assessment of the UPR via CHOP or c-Jun activation, proteasomal efficacy indicators, autophagic flux markers (p62/SQSTM1 phosphorylation state and Beclin 1 levels), and direct mitochondrial functional readouts such as ATP, ROS levels, and calcium handling. Such biomarkers provide a comprehensive profile of cellular stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, rendering them useful for high-throughput rescue screening in CMT models (villalba2020gαqregulatesmitochondrial pages 214-216, finkbeiner2020theautophagylysosomal pages 16-17).

In summary, the mechanistic insights reveal that ER stress and UPR, coupled with overloaded proteasomal degradation and activated autophagy pathways, intersect with altered mitochondrial dynamics, defective mitophagy, excessive ROS generation, and dysregulated calcium signaling. This integrated dysfunction forms the disease basis in CMT Schwann cells and offers a set of candidate biomarkers—ranging from autophagic markers to mitochondrial function metrics—for use in cell-based assay readouts to evaluate therapeutic rescue strategies.
