Query: Comprehensive review of drug-like modulators targeting intracellular signaling pathways critical for paranodal maintenance (e.g., Rho GTPases, PI3K/Akt) with evidence of functional improvement in CMT rodent demyelination models and human safety data

The current literature does not support a robust set of drug‐like modulators directly targeting Rho GTPases (for example, RHOF or BCR) for the treatment of CMT, as the available Open Targets data and reviews indicate limited associations with CMT subtypes and an absence of experimental evidence in rodent demyelination models or human safety studies (morena2019charcotmarietoothfrommolecules pages 3-4).

In contrast, modulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is more prominently represented in preclinical studies and clinical investigations. For instance, the combination therapy PXT3003—comprising baclofen, naltrexone, and sorbitol—has been shown to downregulate PMP22 mRNA expression and to simultaneously correct the dysregulated PI3K/Akt (as well as MEK/ERK) signaling pathways in Schwann cells. These effects translate into improved myelination, enhanced neuromuscular function, and reduced signs of demyelination in rodent CMT1A models (morena2019charcotmarietoothfrommolecules pages 6-8, stavrou2021emergingtherapiesfor pages 6-8). Early clinical trials have also revealed a favorable safety and tolerability profile for PXT3003, with subsequent studies underway to further validate its efficacy in patients (okamoto2023thecurrentstate pages 5-7).

Beyond PXT3003, additional evidence supports that modulating PI3K/Akt signaling via upstream effectors such as neuregulin-1 type III contributes to improved Schwann cell differentiation and myelination in rodent models. Although these studies underscore the importance of PI3K/Akt in paranodal maintenance, the direct correlation with specific drug-like modulators remains less defined than in the case of PXT3003 (morena2019charcotmarietoothfrommolecules pages 6-8).

Other intracellular pathways, despite not being the primary focus for Rho GTPase modulators, have also shown promise in terms of ensuring paranodal stability. For example, HDAC6 inhibitors, such as ACY-1215 (ricolinostat), have demonstrated functional improvements in rodent models by restoring axonal transport and microtubule stability—all processes that are indirectly related to the maintenance of the paranodal architecture. These compounds have corroborative human safety data in contexts like oncology, though their direct utility in CMT remains part of an emerging therapeutic narrative (okamoto2023thecurrentstate pages 8-10, stavrou2021emergingtherapiesfor pages 9-11).

Additionally, a broad search of clinical trial registries reveals an active interest in exploring both Rho GTPase and PI3K/Akt modulators in the context of demyelinating neuropathies, including CMT. However, while over 190 clinical trials have been identified targeting these pathways, the specific details of preclinical data showing functional improvement in rodent models—particularly for Rho GTPase modulators—are not explicitly described in the current data, and the direct translation to human safety remains to be fully established (Clinical Trial Search: Rho GTPase modulator OR PI3K/Akt modulator AND Charcot-Marie-Tooth OR demyelinating neuropathy).

In summary, while there is a theoretical and experimental rationale for targeting intracellular signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt in the context of paranodal maintenance and myelin integrity in CMT, the most compelling evidence at present relates to compounds like PXT3003. These agents demonstrate both functional improvement in rodent models and promising human safety data. Conversely, the data for direct Rho GTPase modulators is currently limited, with no clear evidence of drug-like compounds achieving functional outcomes in rodent demyelination models or advancing into clinical safety validation (okamoto2023thecurrentstate pages 5-7, morena2019charcotmarietoothfrommolecules pages 3-4).
