Query: Summarize pathological alterations in cytoskeletal and membrane trafficking machinery (e.g., microtubule-associated proteins, vesicular transport) within Schwann cells in CMT models, and their impact on paranode maintenance and node of Ranvier stability

Mutations linked to Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease induce pathologic alterations in both the cytoskeletal elements and membrane trafficking machinery in Schwann cells that are essential for maintaining myelin integrity, paranodal organization, and node of Ranvier stability. Specifically, abnormal dynamics of microtubules and neurofilaments disturb intracellular transport processes and the precise spatial delivery of membrane components required for proper paranode assembly. For example, mutations in microtubule-associated proteins and motor proteins compromise the microtubule network, impairing axonal transport and intercellular signaling between Schwann cells and neurons, which is critical for the maintenance of paranodal loops and proper clustering of ion channels at nodes of Ranvier (beijer2019defectsinaxonal pages 1-3).

Schwann cells, in particular, display a range of cytoskeletal defects that include aberrant actin dynamics and disorganized intermediate filaments. Proteins such as INF2, essential for the regulation of actin polymerization and depolymerization, when mutated, result in altered actin filament turnover. This alteration disrupts the formation of key cytoplasmic compartments necessary for Schwann cell elongation and myelin sheath formation (jerath2015hereditarymotorand pages 5-6). Similarly, loss-of-function mutations in periaxin (PRX), which normally links the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular basal lamina via interactions with dystrophin-related proteins, lead to defective formation of cellular compartments within Schwann cells and consequent destabilization of myelin architecture. Such disruptions are observed as focal myelin outfoldings and progressive demyelination, highlighting the critical role of cytoskeletal integrity in maintaining paranodal structure (jerath2015hereditarymotorand pages 5-5).

Moreover, defects in vesicular transport mechanisms have also been documented. Schwann cells rely on dynamic endosomal and lysosomal pathways for the proper cycling of proteins and lipids. Key regulators of vesicle trafficking, including Rab GTPases (e.g., Rab7) and Dynamin-2 (DNM2), are frequently mutated in CMT. Such mutations impair the formation, transport, and fusion of vesicles. Disruption in the endolysosomal pathway not only leads to the accumulation of misfolded or aggregated proteins (such as abnormal accumulations of PMP22) but also compromises membrane recycling processes. These deficits hinder the ability of Schwann cells to deliver critical membrane components and signaling molecules to the paranodal region, contributing to the destabilization of both paranodal loops and the organization of nodes of Ranvier (beijer2019defectsinaxonal pages 12-12, jerath2015hereditarymotorand pages 7-8).

The impaired vesicular trafficking is further compounded by defects in the regulation of phosphoinositide metabolism – for instance, mutations in FIG4 or LITAF disrupt the endolysosomal system by affecting lipid phosphatase activities and vesicle maturation. Although these studies are often centered on fibroblasts or neuronal models, the extrapolation is clear that similar disturbances occur in Schwann cells. Schwann cell dysfunction secondary to defective vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal disorganization results in altered myelin turnover, compromised signaling at axon-Schwann cell interfaces, and a failure to properly anchor or recycle the proteins that maintain the paranodal junction integrity (miressi2020hereditaryperipheralneuropathies pages 62-66, edgar2020adysfunctionalendolysosomal pages 1-2).

Ultimately, the confluence of disrupted microtubule stability, impaired actin dynamics, and defective membrane trafficking leads to insufficient paranodal maintenance and node of Ranvier stability. This structural disintegration adversely affects saltatory conduction and contributes to the progressive sensory and motor deficits seen in CMT models (stassart2018theaxonmyelinunit pages 14-15, beijer2019defectsinaxonal pages 12-14).
