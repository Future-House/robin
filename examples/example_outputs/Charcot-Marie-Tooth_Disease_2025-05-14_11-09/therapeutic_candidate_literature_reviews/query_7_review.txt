Query: Review the impact of common CMT-causing mutations (PMP22 duplication/triplication, MPZ, GJB1, MFN2) on Schwann cell–axon interactions, nodal/paranodal architecture, and conduction properties in both rodent models and patient-derived iPSC systems, including evidence for causative vs. secondary pathology

Common CMT-causing mutations—including PMP22 duplications/triplications, MPZ, GJB1, and MFN2—lead to a spectrum of pathological alterations by directly affecting Schwann cell function and indirectly causing axonal degeneration. These mutations compromise Schwann cell–axon interactions through disruptions in myelin formation, maintenance, and the organization of nodal/paranodal domains, which are essential for saltatory conduction and rapid nerve impulse propagation (el‐abassi2014charcot‐marie‐toothdiseasean pages 1-3, miressi2020hereditaryperipheralneuropathies pages 55-62).

In the case of PMP22 mutations, the gene duplication or triplication characteristic of CMT1A results in Schwann cell dysfunction by derailing the tightly regulated processes of myelin production and maintenance. Overexpression of PMP22 destabilizes the compact myelin structure, leading to abnormal myelin morphology, including altered myelin thickness and onion-bulb formation, and ultimately affecting axon–Schwann cell signaling. These structural abnormalities disturb the nodal and paranodal regions, manifesting as widened nodal gaps and disrupted ion channel organization that severely impair nerve conduction properties (murakami2019schwanncelland pages 1-4, santoroUnknownyearcharcotmarietoothdiseaseinsights pages 20-23).

Mutations in the MPZ gene, encoding myelin protein zero—a critical adhesion molecule for myelin compaction—similarly perturb the integrity of myelin. MPZ mutations often lead to protein misfolding and aberrant intracellular trafficking, which in turn trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress and contribute to Schwann cell apoptosis. This cascade of events not only results in primary demyelination but also induces secondary axonal degeneration by disrupting the essential trophic support that Schwann cells provide to axons, further deteriorating nerve conduction velocities (miressi2020hereditaryperipheralneuropathies pages 62-66, murakami2019schwanncelland pages 4-7).

GJB1 mutations affect connexin 32 and disrupt gap junction communication within Schwann cells. These gap junctions are vital for intercellular ion and metabolite transfer, which supports the maintenance of the nodal/paranodal architecture and overall nerve homeostasis. Rodent models have consistently shown that loss or malformation of connexin 32-containing channels leads to focal conduction blocks and abnormal electrophysiological profiles that mirror those observed in patients, thereby reinforcing the causative role of Schwann cell dysfunction in the disease process (murakami2019schwanncelland pages 1-4, santoroUnknownyearcharcotmarietoothdiseaseinsights pages 34-38).

MFN2 mutations, while primarily associated with axonal forms of CMT (CMT2A), also interfere with the interactions between Schwann cells and neurons. MFN2 is critical for mitochondrial fusion and axonal energy metabolism, and dysfunctional MFN2 leads to impaired mitochondrial trafficking along axons. This mitochondrial deficit detrimentally influences the axonal cytoskeleton and can secondarily affect Schwann cell support, thereby contributing to nodal/paranodal disorganization and reduced compound muscle action potentials (miressi2020hereditaryperipheralneuropathies pages 62-66, shackleford2022anewmouse pages 31-32).

Data derived from rodent models have been invaluable in delineating the timeline and sequence of these pathological events, often demonstrating that primary Schwann cell abnormalities precede and potentially instigate secondary axonal pathology. For instance, rodent models overexpressing PMP22 or carrying MPZ mutations reliably recapitulate the slowed nerve conduction velocities and altered nodal structures found in patients, highlighting that the initial insult is Schwann cell–derived (manganelli2015charcotmarietoothdisease pages 4-5, shackleford2022anewmouse pages 31-32).

Patient-derived iPSC systems have further advanced our understanding by providing human cell-specific readouts that confirm these pathological mechanisms. iPSC-derived Schwann cells from CMT patients exhibit defects in lipid metabolism, immune dysregulation, and diminished myelination capacity—all of which are linked to disrupted Schwann cell–axon interactions and compromised nodal/paranodal integrity. These studies reinforce the notion that in many CMT subtypes (especially those involving PMP22 and MPZ defects), the initiating pathology is Schwann cell–autonomous, with subsequent secondary axonal degeneration (lent2024advancesandchallenges pages 4-5, oliveira2023neuronschwanncellinteractions pages 10-11).

Collectively, the evidence from both rodent models and patient-derived iPSC systems supports a dual pathogenic mechanism in CMT, wherein primary Schwann cell defects cause direct impairment of myelin and nodal architecture, and these abnormalities then lead to secondary axonal degeneration and impaired electrophysiological conduction. This integrated understanding provides a solid foundation for developing targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at correcting Schwann cell dysfunction while also mitigating secondary axonal damage (stavrou2021emergingtherapiesfor pages 25-26).
