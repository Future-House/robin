Query: Query literature for mechanism-of-action studies of lead compounds identified in assays of nodal domain recovery—particularly inhibitors or activators of key signaling pathways (e.g., neuregulin-ErbB2/3, FAK/Src, RhoA/ROCK)—that demonstrate target engagement by biochemical or imaging methods in disease-relevant CMT models, including any translational PK/PD correlations

The literature currently provides no convincing evidence that lead compounds—whether inhibitors or activators of the neuregulin-ErbB2/3, FAK/Src, or RhoA/ROCK signaling pathways—have been validated in disease‐relevant CMT models using target engagement studies that include in vivo imaging or biochemical assays paired with translational PK/PD correlations. The Open Targets queries repeatedly indicate that while the pathways are mechanistically implicated in CMT pathogenesis, there is an absence of robust experimental data showing target engagement in nodal domain recovery assays. In fact, the database searches demonstrate only weak associations for a few targets (e.g., SLA2, BCR, ABL1) with CMT, and none of the direct targets queried—FAK, Src, RhoA, ROCK, ErbB2, or ErbB3—have been linked with lead compounds that produce measurable nodal domain recovery effects using advanced imaging or biochemical methods in rodent models (OpenTargets Search: Charcot-Marie-Tooth-FAK,Src,RhoA,ROCK,ErbB2,ErbB3).

Similarly, the review by Lee et al. extensively discusses the dysregulation of ErbB receptor trafficking and signaling in Schwann cells as a central mechanism in various demyelinating forms of CMT. Although the article proposes several therapeutic strategies (for example, neuregulin-1 supplementation, small-molecule kinase inhibitors like PKI 166, Mek inhibitors such as CI-1040 and U0126, as well as agents promoting receptor internalization like geldanamycin), it does not present any data confirming target engagement through imaging or biochemical assays. Moreover, there are no accompanying translational PK/PD correlations reported in rodent CMT models that would reinforce the mechanism-of-action of these potential lead compounds (lee2017dysregulationoferbb pages 11-13, lee2017dysregulationoferbb pages 13-14).

In several sections, Lee et al. underscore the potential of modulating the neuregulin-ErbB2/3 pathway to restore Schwann cell function and ameliorate demyelination. For instance, recombinant human neuregulin-1 type I has been shown to modulate Erk and Akt signaling and reverse some neuropathologic features in a transgenic rat model of CMT1A. However, these promising preclinical findings are not backed by detailed nodal domain recovery assays that utilize in vivo imaging or biochemical target engagement techniques, nor do they provide an integrated translational pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic framework (lee2017dysregulationoferbb pages 11-13, lee2017dysregulationoferbb pages 14-15).

The overall conclusion from both the Open Targets data and the mechanistic review is that while the implicated signaling pathways (neuregulin-ErbB2/3, FAK/Src, and RhoA/ROCK) remain promising therapeutic targets in CMT, no lead compounds have yet been identified that satisfy the stringent criteria of demonstrating biochemical or imaging-confirmed target engagement, nor have there been studies that correlate these findings with translational PK/PD data in disease-relevant models. Thus, despite substantial mechanistic insights into receptor trafficking and signaling abnormalities in CMT, the gap in evidence precludes drawing reliable conclusions regarding the mechanistic efficacy of any lead compounds in restoring nodal domains in preclinical settings (OpenTargets Search: Charcot-Marie-Tooth-FAK,Src,RhoA,ROCK,ErbB2,ErbB3, lee2017dysregulationoferbb pages 11-13).
