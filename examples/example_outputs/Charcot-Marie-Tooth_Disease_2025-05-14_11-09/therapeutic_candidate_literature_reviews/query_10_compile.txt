Query: Compile evidence on mitochondrial dynamics, metabolic stress, and redox imbalance in Schwann cells and peripheral neurons as drivers of axoglial disjunction in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, focusing on target validation via genetic knockdown or small-molecule modulators that restore paranodal architecture and nerve function in preclinical models

The evidence indicates that disruptions in mitochondrial dynamics, metabolic stress, and redox imbalance in both Schwann cells and peripheral neurons are central drivers of axoglial disjunction in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). Multiple studies have identified mutations in genes encoding key mitochondrial proteins—most notably MFN2, GDAP1, and DNM2—that disturb mitochondrial fusion, fission, and transport, thereby impacting nerve integrity and paranodal architecture (OpenTargets Search: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease).

MFN2, a mitochondrial outer membrane GTPase essential for mitochondrial fusion, has emerged as a critical target. Numerous studies demonstrate that MFN2 mutations, such as the R94Q variant, lead to defective mitochondrial fusion, clustering, and impaired transport along axons. This results in energy deficits and an imbalance between ATP and reactive oxygen species production, precipitating oxidative stress in neurons and Schwann cells. Animal models and cellular studies have shown that genetic knockdown of mutant MFN2 alleles or pharmacological modulation to restore mitofusin balance significantly improves mitochondrial dynamics and axonal transport, thereby rescuing paranodal architecture and nerve function (boutary2019developmentofa pages 107-108, zhou2021restoringmitofusinbalance pages 10-11).

Similarly, GDAP1, which regulates mitochondrial fission and redox homeostasis, has been implicated in maintaining cellular glutathione levels and mitochondrial membrane potential. Mutations in GDAP1 not only affect mitochondrial morphology but also exacerbate metabolic stress by reducing antioxidant defenses. Preclinical models utilizing genetic knockdown techniques to attenuate GDAP1 mutant expression or employing small-molecule modulators that enhance redox balance have demonstrated partial restoration of mitochondrial function, reduced oxidative stress, and improvements in axoglial interactions (komilova2025charcotmarietooth pages 13-13, sarajarvi2020investigatingcellularpathomechanisms pages 48-50).

DNM2, involved in endocytic vesicle trafficking and mitochondrial dynamics, further contributes to the pathology when mutated. Dysfunctional DNM2 affects mitochondrial membrane trafficking and, by extension, the proper distribution of mitochondria along axons required for maintaining energy homeostasis and paranodal integrity. While studies detailing direct genetic knockdown of DNM2 are less extensive, existing evidence supports its role in axoglial disjunction, and small-molecule approaches targeting DNM2-mediated pathways show promise in preclinical models (schiavon2021impairedmitochondrialmobility pages 1-2, sarajarvi2020investigatingcellularpathomechanisms pages 263-264).

Metabolic stress in these cells is amplified by disrupted lactate shuttling between Schwann cells and neurons, a process normally essential for axonal ATP production. Studies indicate that when mitochondrial dynamics are disturbed due to MFN2, GDAP1, or DNM2 mutations, the resulting metabolic imbalance and chronic redox stress further promote axoglial disjunction. Genetic interventions aimed at correcting these disturbances, as well as small-molecule therapies that bolster mitochondrial ATP production or enhance antioxidant defenses, have been shown to mitigate metabolic deficits and stabilize paranodal structures (hameren2018mitochondrialphysiologywithin pages 192-194, shackleford2022anewmouse pages 34-35).

In several animal models of CMT, restoration of mitochondrial function via either genetic knockdown of mutant alleles or the use of small-molecule modulators targeting mitochondrial dynamics has led to significant improvements in nerve conduction and axonal structure. For instance, models utilizing MFN2 knockdowns or MFN2 agonists not only rebalanced mitochondrial fusion/fission processes but also reestablished the proper bioenergetic supply required for axoglial communication at the paranodal regions. Such preclinical evidence strongly supports the therapeutic potential of modulating mitochondrial dynamics and redox homeostasis to reverse the pathological features of CMT (boutary2019developmentofa pages 108-110, zhou2021restoringmitofusinbalance pages 15-15).

Finally, emerging approaches that combine genetic strategies with small-molecule regimens targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic stress underscore the multifaceted role of these pathways in CMT pathology. The cumulative data—from cellular models to intact animal systems—provide compelling validation for targeting mitochondrial dynamics regulators as a means to restore paranodal architecture and improve nerve function in CMT (hameren2018mitochondrialphysiologywithin pages 61-63, scherrer2025frominvivo pages 10-10, bosco2021animalmodelsas pages 19-20).
