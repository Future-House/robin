Query: Identify studies of intracellular signaling cascades that regulate Schwann cell adhesion and nodal domain stability—such as Rho GTPase cycles, FAK/Src pathways, and endocytic trafficking—where genetic manipulation or pharmacological inhibition/rescue experiments validate these pathways as therapeutic targets in CMT

Multiple studies have delineated mechanistic components of Schwann cell adhesion and nodal domain stability through intracellular signaling cascades, and several have used genetic manipulation or pharmacological interventions to validate these pathways as therapeutic targets in Charcot‐Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease.

First, studies focusing on Rho GTPase cycles have demonstrated their critical role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics necessary for Schwann cell adhesion and proper myelination. Genetic ablation and knockdown experiments targeting key Rho GTPases such as Rac1 and Cdc42 have shown that loss of these molecules impairs the formation of radial lamellae and disrupts axonal sorting, culminating in abnormal myelin sheath formation. These data advocate that precise modulation of Rho GTPase activity is necessary to maintain the adhesive interactions between Schwann cells and axons and stabilize nodal domains, setting the stage for therapeutic interventions aimed at correcting these deficiencies (torii2019cellularsignalregulatedschwann pages 4-6, magnaghi2017schwanncelldevelopment pages 2-3).

Second, the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src family kinase pathways have been established as crucial mediators of integrin signaling in Schwann cells. Genetic manipulation studies—such as Schwann cell–specific FAK knockouts—have resulted in pronounced defects in axonal sorting and myelination, indicative of impaired cell adhesion. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition experiments targeting Src kinases have underscored their role in cytoskeleton reorganization and adhesion junction stability. These studies provide experimental validation that interventions modifying FAK/Src activity can potentially rescue Schwann cell deficits and thereby stabilize nodal domains in demyelinating neuropathies like CMT (feltri2021thehippopathway pages 18-19, magnaghi2017schwanncelldevelopment pages 2-3).

Third, endocytic trafficking has been recognized as a central process regulating receptor turnover and signaling termination—a mechanism essential for Schwann cell function and myelin maintenance. Research involving genetic manipulation of key endocytic regulators, such as conditional deletion of Vps34 in Schwann cells, has demonstrated that disrupted endosomal-lysosomal trafficking leads to abnormal receptor modifications (e.g., hyperphosphorylation of ErbB receptors) and consequent defects in Schwann cell adhesion and myelination. Complementary pharmacological rescue approaches that modulate phosphoinositide metabolism have been shown to correct downstream signaling imbalances, notably within the Akt pathway, thereby restoring elements of myelin homeostasis. Collectively, these findings underscore the potential of targeting endocytic trafficking machinery to rectify adhesion deficits and promote nodal domain stability in CMT models (mammel2022distinctrolesfor pages 47-51, lee2017dysregulationoferbb pages 4-6).

In addition, combined pharmacological strategies have provided proof-of-principle evidence: for instance, the use of agents that elevate cyclic AMP levels (e.g., forskolin) has been shown to rescue myelination deficits in Rac1-compromised models, reinforcing the therapeutic potential of modulating downstream effectors impacted by disrupted Rho GTPase and adhesion signaling (torii2019cellularsignalregulatedschwann pages 9-12).

Despite these promising preclinical findings, it is important to note that a comprehensive review of clinical trial databases reveals no current drug intervention studies explicitly targeting these intracellular signaling pathways in CMT, emphasizing the existing gap between mechanistic validation and clinical translation (Clinical Trials Search: (Schwann cell OR myelination) AND (Rho GTPase OR FAK OR Src OR endocytic trafficking) AND (Charcot-Marie-Tooth OR CMT) AND AREA[InterventionType]DRUG).

In summary, genetic and pharmacological intervention studies that manipulate Rho GTPase cycles, FAK/Src signaling, and endocytic trafficking collectively validate these cascades as critical regulators of Schwann cell adhesion and nodal domain stability. These findings form a robust mechanistic basis for novel therapeutic approaches in CMT disease (torii2019cellularsignalregulatedschwann pages 4-6, feltri2021thehippopathway pages 18-19, mammel2022distinctrolesfor pages 47-51, lee2017dysregulationoferbb pages 8-9).
