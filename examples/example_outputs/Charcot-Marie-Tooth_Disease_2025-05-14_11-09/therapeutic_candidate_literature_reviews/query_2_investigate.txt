Query: Investigate repurposed small molecule therapeutics evaluated in peripheral neuropathy or demyelinating disease preclinical models that specifically modulate paranodal junction proteins such as Caspr and NF155, demonstrating restoration of axoglial barrier function with documented in vivo efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety profiling

Based on the provided context, there are no repurposed small molecule therapeutics reported in peripheral neuropathy or demyelinating disease preclinical models that specifically target and modulate paranodal junction proteins (e.g., Caspr and NF155) to restore axoglial barrier function with documented in vivo efficacy, detailed pharmacokinetics, and comprehensive safety profiling (gingele2020emergingmyelinrepair pages 16-19, grassi2019identificationofthe pages 38-42, lloyd20172017peripheralnerve pages 3-4).

The majority of the excerpts focus on biologics—such as recombinant antibodies (e.g., rHIgM22 and anti-LINGO-1 agents) and immunomodulatory therapies (e.g., rituximab targeting NF155 autoantibodies)—to promote remyelination or to reduce immune-mediated damage in conditions such as multiple sclerosis and CIDP (gingele2020emergingmyelinrepair pages 16-19, lloyd20172017peripheralnerve pages 46-47). Although there are reports of repurposed small molecules—for example, selective HDAC6 inhibitors rescuing axonal transport deficits in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease models and small molecule inhibitors of STOML3 reducing neuropathic pain hypersensitivity—none of these studies document direct modulation or repair of the paranodal junction components such as Caspr or NF155 (lloyd20172017peripheralnerve pages 137-138, lloyd20172017peripheralnerve pages 3-4).

Additionally, preclinical models described in the context primarily concentrate on mechanisms of demyelination/remyelination and the characterization of antibody-mediated disruption of paranodal integrity rather than on small molecule strategies designed to restore these specific molecular complexes. There is an absence of any preclinical study or report from 2015 onward that provides evidence for small molecule interventions achieving restoration of paranodal or axoglial barrier function, along with in vivo efficacy data, pharmacokinetic profiles, or safety assessments (vagionitis2021studyingaxonaland pages 18-22, lloyd20172017peripheralnerve pages 23-24).

In summary, while several pharmacological approaches have been explored in the treatment of demyelinating diseases and peripheral neuropathies—including antibody-based therapies and repurposed small molecules that address other aspects of nerve pathology—the specific criteria of modulating paranodal proteins such as Caspr and NF155 with comprehensive in vivo validations are not met according to the presented excerpts.
