Query: Investigate genetic and functional evidence linking dysregulation of septate junction proteins (e.g., Caspr, Contactin, NF155) to axonal conduction defects in CMT, including studies using knockout or knock-in mouse models and rescue experiments

Septate junction proteins—principally Caspr (encoded by CNTNAP1), Contactin (CNTN1), and Neurofascin-155 (NF155)—are critical for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of paranodal axoglial junctions. Disruption of these proteins is strongly linked with axonal conduction defects that underlie Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease.

Genetic evidence primarily comes from studies identifying mutations in CNTNAP1. For instance, Vallat et al. demonstrated that loss‐of‐function mutations in CNTNAP1 cause severe disruptions in paranodal junctions, including the loss of septate-like transverse bands, widening of the paranodal gap, and detachment of myelin loops from the axolemma. These ultrastructural lesions correlate with impaired nerve conduction velocities (vallat2016contactinassociatedprotein1 pages 4-5, vallat2016contactinassociatedprotein1 pages 4-4). The human genetic data from patients and corroborative findings in Caspr-1 null mice—where similar paranodal defects are observed—provide compelling evidence that CNTNAP1 dysregulation is central to the pathogenesis of conduction abnormalities seen in CMT.

Functional evidence from mouse models extends these findings. Knockout and knock-in studies disrupting entry points for these septate junction proteins have been instrumental. Mouse models lacking Caspr-1 or Contactin-1 exhibit severe paranodal disorganization, which results in mislocalization of ion channels essential for saltatory conduction. For example, studies using Caspr-1 null mice reveal that even though Contactin-1 expression is maintained, the absence of Caspr-1 alone is sufficient to prevent proper septate-like junction formation and impair axonal conduction (vallat2016contactinassociatedprotein1 pages 4-5). Similarly, genetic ablation of NF155 in rodent models disrupts paranodal junction integrity, leading to mislocalization of sodium and potassium channels and consequent reductions in conduction velocity (li2015molecularregulatorsof pages 18-20, green2013organizationandfunction pages 165-168).

In addition to conventional knockouts, knock-in models have provided nuanced insights. For instance, the Cadm3Y170C mouse model—although primarily investigating cell adhesion molecules within axon–glia interactions—demonstrates aberrant localization of key paranodal markers, including Caspr (a proxy for proper septate junction structure) and NR-CAM. The altered trafficking and mis-localization of these proteins in knock-in mice underscore the functional interdependencies among septate junction components and how their dysregulation leads to conduction defects characteristic of CMT (rebelo2021acadm3variant pages 13-15).

Rescue experiments further substantiate the functional role of septate junction proteins. Restoration of NF155 or Caspr-1 expression in mutant mouse models has been shown to reinstate proper paranodal architecture and improve conduction velocities (li2015molecularregulatorsof pages 18-20, green2013organizationandfunctiona pages 165-168). These experiments pinpoint a potential therapeutic avenue; by correcting the dysregulation of septate junction proteins, normal axonal conduction can be re-established.

Moreover, studies using additional knockout models targeting contactins provide a broader context: disruption of these adhesion molecules not only affects paranodal stability but also leads to mislocalization of ion channels at juxtaparanodal regions, further compromising axonal excitability and conduction. Evidence from these models—coupled with autoantibody studies in demyelinating neuropathies—suggests that septate junction dysregulation, whether by genetic mutation or immune-mediated attack, is a convergent mechanism linking molecular pathology with conduction deficits in CMT (kalafatakis2021implicationofcontactins pages 4-6, li2015molecularregulatorsof pages 1-2).

In summary, both genetic and functional studies in knockout and knock-in mouse models, supported by rescue experiments, robustly demonstrate that the dysregulation of septate junction proteins such as Caspr, Contactin, and NF155 leads to structural disruptions at paranodes, mislocalization of ion channels, and ultimately impaired axonal conduction in CMT.
