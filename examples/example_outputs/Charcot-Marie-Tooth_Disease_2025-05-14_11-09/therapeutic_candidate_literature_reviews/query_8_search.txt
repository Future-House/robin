Query: Search ultrastructural and advanced imaging analyses (EM, super-resolution, live-cell) of nodal gap spacing, paranodal septate junction integrity, and axoglial contact sites in CMT patient nerve biopsies or experimental models, correlating structural defects with specific molecular disruptions

Ultrastructural studies using electron microscopy (EM) along with advanced imaging techniques—including super‐resolution and live‐cell microscopy—have provided compelling evidence that specific molecular disruptions in Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease lead to marked alterations in nodal gap spacing, paranodal septate junction integrity, and axoglial contact sites. In experimental models such as the Mpz‐t124m (TM) mouse model, which recapitulates human T124M‐CMT2J, EM analyses reveal axonal swellings with organelle accumulation and the presence of regenerative clusters where regenerating axons are frequently amyelinated or hypomyelinated. Critically, the TM model shows an elongation of paranodal regions, as evidenced by extended areas positive for the paranodal marker Caspr and increased nodal gap spacing. These findings underscore a direct correlation between the mutant MPZ protein’s altered glycosylation pattern, defective paranodal junction formation, and disrupted axon–Schwann cell communication (shackleford2022mpzt124mmousemodel pages 10-12).

Complementary studies in patient nerve biopsies, particularly in cases with CNTNAP1 mutations, have demonstrated a complete absence of transverse bands—normally present at paranodal septate junctions—which leads to a widened gap between Schwann cell myelin loops and the axolemma. EM images clearly show that loss of these transverse bands disrupts the tight axoglial adherence necessary for proper nerve conduction. This structural defect is directly linked to specific molecular changes, such as truncations in the CASPR1 protein that prevent proper interaction with contactin-1, a disruption that is unique when compared with other CMT forms that do not exhibit such paranodal abnormalities (vallat2016contactinassociatedprotein1 pages 1-2, vallat2016contactinassociatedprotein1 pages 4-4).

Advanced imaging has further refined our understanding of these disruptions. For instance, super-resolution microscopy applied in a Cadm3Y170C mouse model has documented a significant decrease in the co-localization of CADM3 with CADM4 at the axon–Schwann cell interface. This abnormal spatial distribution indicates that compromised cell adhesion at axoglial junctions results in faulty paranodal organization and altered nodal gap architecture. Such findings not only reinforce the EM data but also provide dynamic insights into protein interaction disruptions at the paranode (rebelo2021acadm3variant pages 13-15).

Beyond these models, studies of CMT patient biopsies have revealed that mutations in genes such as MPZ, MFN2, GDAP1, NEFL, GJB1, and DNM2 result in a spectrum of morphological defects. In MPZ mutation-related neuropathies, for example, EM has identified characteristic abnormalities including onion bulb formations, collagen pockets, and compromised myelin organization. These changes are indicative of failed axoglial communication secondary to molecular disruptions in MPZ protein function and its processing, which inevitably affect both the nodal gap spacing and paranodal junction stability (bremer2024myelinproteinzero pages 8-10).

Similarly, in CMT1X, mutations in GJB1 encoding connexin32 disrupt gap junction channels that are pivotal for maintaining Schwann cell homeostasis. The ensuing disorganization of myelin, as seen by vacuolization and myelin compaction defects, further translates into altered paranodal architectures and abnormal nodal spatial arrangements (kleopa2011theroleof pages 3-4, manganelli2015charcotmarietoothdisease pages 6-7).

Collectively, these ultrastructural and advanced imaging analyses establish a clear link between molecular defects—whether due to impaired glycosylation (as in MPZ mutations), loss of integral paranodal components (as in CNTNAP1 mutations), or disrupted gap junction communication (as in GJB1 mutations)—and the resultant morphological abnormalities. Disruptions in paranodal septate junction integrity and aberrant nodal gap spacing compromise axoglial contact sites, thereby underpinning the impaired nerve conduction observed in CMT neuropathies (duchesne2018nervebiopsyis pages 2-3, susuki2013nodeofranvier pages 5-7, cifuentesdiaz2011nodesofranvier pages 1-2).
