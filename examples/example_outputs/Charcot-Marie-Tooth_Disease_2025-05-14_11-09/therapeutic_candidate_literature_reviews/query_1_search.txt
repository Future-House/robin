Query: Search for studies employing high-throughput small-molecule libraries screened using nodal domain formation or paranodal junction assembly assays in peripheral demyelinating neuropathies, specifically evaluating compounds that restore axoglial integrity and molecular markers of nodal/paranodal architecture in cell and animal models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, with emphasis on target validation, mechanism confirmation, and preliminary pharmacokinetics/safety data

Several lines of evidence indicate that research is actively pursuing high‐throughput small‐molecule screening to identify compounds that modulate myelination and axoglial integrity in peripheral demyelinating neuropathies such as Charcot‑Marie‑Tooth (CMT) disease, yet few studies have explicitly reported the use of assays based on nodal domain formation or paranodal junction assembly. For example, an on‑going clinical trials search retrieved 14 studies investigating small molecules or high‑throughput screening (HTS) approaches in CMT, where the mechanistic intent includes restoration of myelin and axoglial structures. However, while these trials are aligned with targeting aspects like myelination and axoglial integrity, the specific readouts for nodal or paranodal architecture have not been detailed (Clinical Trials Search: Charcot‑Marie‑Tooth AND (small molecule OR high‑throughput screening) AND nodal domain OR paranodal junction OR axoglial integrity OR myelination AND (safety OR pharmacokinetics)).

In preclinical and experimental settings, several reports describe HTS efforts focused on gene‑dosage modulation and protein homeostasis in CMT models. In particular, studies involving genome editing‐enabled HTS assays have expanded drug target pathways in CMT, identifying modulators that, while primarily assayed for effects on myelination (e.g., via restoration of PMP22 or mutant MPZ homeostasis), imply potential downstream benefits on axoglial integrity and, by extension, nodal/paranodal organization (stavrou2021emergingtherapiesfor pages 8-9, pantera2020transcriptionalcontrolof pages 43-45). Despite these promising approaches, the literature does not provide extensive details on assay systems that directly measure nodal domain formation or paranodal junction assembly. Instead, many studies report on enhanced myelination in animal models and improved Schwann cell differentiation as assay endpoints, which serve as indirect markers for the integrity of the nodal/paranodal architecture.

Complementing these HTS efforts are advanced patient‑derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) platforms, such as the SCREEN4PN system, which has been designed to enable efficient, high‑throughput screening of therapeutic compounds. This platform utilizes both 2D and 3D cultures to assess nerve outgrowth, axonal transport, and other phenotypic features that are relevant to axoglial interactions. Although these assays provide an attractive and rapid preclinical model that could, in principle, be refined to include nodal or paranodal molecular markers, the current reports do not explicitly detail screening using nodal assembly readouts (noordhout2023overviewofpatients pages 122-123).

Regarding target validation, mechanism confirmation, and preliminary pharmacokinetics/safety data, several candidate molecules have been evaluated in standardized safety trials. For instance, the ascorbic acid trial in CMT1A (NCT00271635) assessed safety via motor nerve conduction parameters and general clinical endpoints, yet it did not specifically incorporate assay readouts based on nodal/paranodal junction formation. Similarly, emerging therapies such as those employing proteostasis regulators (e.g., curcumin for MPZ mutation models) demonstrate phenotypic improvement in myelination and axoglial integrity, but these studies usually do not isolate nodal domain formation as a discrete evaluation criterion (stavrou2021emergingtherapiesfor pages 24-25, jerath2015hereditarymotorand pages 5-5).

In summary, while the overall research environment in CMT is rigged for the discovery of small molecules that can restore myelination and improve axoglial integrity—with several HTS initiatives and iPSC-based platforms in development—the explicit use of nodal domain formation or paranodal junction assembly assays as primary screening endpoints currently remains underreported. Future studies will benefit from incorporating these detailed markers into HTS assays alongside comprehensive target validation, mechanism confirmation, and preliminary pharmacokinetic/safety assessments (stavrou2021emergingtherapiesfor pages 8-9, Clinical Trials Search: Charcot‑Marie‑Tooth AND (small molecule OR high‑throughput screening) AND nodal domain OR paranodal junction OR axoglial integrity OR myelination AND (safety OR pharmacokinetics)).
