Query: Identify repurposed FDA-approved compounds or clinical-stage molecules that modulate expression, localization, or interaction of paranodal proteins (Caspr, Contactin-1, Neurofascin-155) in CMT patient-derived Schwann cell or dorsal root ganglion neuron coculture models, including data on dose–response, target engagement assays, and functional readouts of conduction velocity or nodal domain restoration

None have been identified. Comprehensive searches of clinical trial registries and target‐disease databases show that, to date, no repurposed FDA‐approved compounds or clinical‐stage molecules have been documented that modulate the expression, localization, or interaction of the paranodal proteins Caspr, Contactin‑1, or Neurofascin‑155 in coculture models derived from Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) patient Schwann cells or dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (Clinical Trials Search: (Caspr OR Contactin-1 OR Neurofascin-155) AND (Charcot-Marie-Tooth OR CMT) AND (Schwann cell OR dorsal root ganglion) AND (nodal domain OR paranodal) AND (repurposed OR FDA-approved OR clinical-stage molecule)).

While several preclinical investigations have explored the use of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitors – for example, Tubastatin A and CKD504 – to improve aspects of Schwann cell function and axonal transport in models of CMT, none of these studies have specifically focused on modulating paranodal protein expression or localization. In the cited studies featuring HDAC6 inhibition (lent2024advancesandchallenges pages 5-5, lloyd20172017peripheralnerve pages 137-138), the primary outcomes were improvement in myelination and rescue of axonal transport deficits rather than a direct investigation into changes in Caspr, Contactin‑1, or Neurofascin‑155. Data on dose–response relationships, target engagement assays specific to these paranodal proteins, or functional readouts such as restoration of conduction velocity and nodal domain integrity have not been reported in the context of HDAC6 inhibitor interventions.

Similarly, the Open Targets Platform analysis confirms that although there are bioinformatic and genetic associations between these paranodal proteins and CMT, no experimental evidence has been catalogued linking repurposed or clinical-stage molecules with modulation of these targets (OpenTargets Search: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-Contactin-1,Caspr,NFASC). The available animal model and in vitro studies, for instance those described by Bosco et al. (bosco2021animalmodelsas pages 18-19) and Shackleford et al. (shackleford2022anewmouse pages 31-32), primarily address other aspects of disease pathology such as PMP22 overexpression, axonal transport deficits, or general myelination defects, rather than direct pharmacological modulation of paranodal protein complexes.

In summary, none of the reviewed sources provide evidence—be it dose–response data, direct target engagement assays, or functional endpoints like conduction velocity improvement and nodal domain reconstruction—that repurposed or clinical-stage molecules can modulate the paranodal markers Caspr, Contactin‑1, or Neurofascin‑155 in Schwann cell/DRG coculture models derived from CMT patients (Clinical Trials Search: …, OpenTargets Search: …, lloyd20172017peripheralnerve pages 137-138). This indicates a significant gap in translational research where such targeted modulation has yet to be achieved, and suggests that further focused preclinical research is needed before advancing such interventions into clinical trial settings.
