Query: Investigate genetic and functional studies delineating the role of paranodal cell adhesion molecules (Caspr1, Neurofascin-155, Contactin-1) in the formation and maintenance of nodal domains in peripheral nerves, with specific references to CMT mutations or animal knockout/knock-in models that phenocopy human disease pathophysiology

Paranodal cell adhesion molecules such as Caspr1, Neurofascin-155 (NF155), and Contactin-1 are essential for assembling and maintaining the unique axo‐glial junctions that establish discrete nodal and paranodal domains in myelinated peripheral nerves. Genetic and functional studies provide compelling evidence that loss or dysfunction of these molecules induces structural disorganization of paranodes, resulting in impaired ion channel clustering and nerve conduction deficits that phenocopy human demyelinating diseases, including specific forms of Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) neuropathy.

Animal knockout models have been instrumental in delineating the role of these molecules. For example, Caspr1 knockout mice exhibit a near absence of transverse bands at the paranode and display delayed conduction velocities linked to disorganized paranodal loops, reduced nodal sodium channel clustering, and altered distribution of Contactin, thus confirming Caspr1’s central role in paranodal integrity (herman2012theroleof pages 42-46). Likewise, studies in mice lacking Contactin-1 or NF155 reveal that the loss of these proteins disrupts the formation of septate-like junctions. Such models show mislocalization of voltage-gated channels and consequent electrophysiological deficits, underscoring that the cooperative interactions among Caspr1, NF155, and Contactin-1 are necessary for the maintenance of nodal domains (faivresarrailh2013neuroglialinteractionsat pages 11-12, fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 2-3).

In addition to knockout studies, genetic mutations in the genes encoding these molecules have been linked to phenotypes resembling human CMT disease. Novel mutations in CNTNAP1 (encoding Caspr1) are associated with congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy and other neuropathic features that include paranodal lesions and abnormal sodium channel clustering (li2020mutationsofcntnap1 pages 17-18). Animal models carrying CNTNAP1 mutations not only recapitulate key aspects of human CMT pathology but also illustrate the critical contribution of paranodal CAMs to proper nerve conduction and myelin maintenance (li2020mutationsofcntnap1 pages 18-18). Furthermore, studies investigating HDAC1/2-dependent P0 expression also emphasize the relevance of paranodal integrity for nodal domain maintenance, with disruptions of this system resulting in pathogenic features reminiscent of CMT (brugger2015hdac12dependentp0expression pages 30-31).

Additional studies further consolidate these functional observations. Investigations have shown that disruptions in the lipid environment—such as alterations in sulfatide content—can destabilize the paranodal complex by impairing the proper targeting and stabilization of Caspr and NF155, further compromising the paranodal junction (kwong2011sulfatideisrequired pages 36-40, kozar2022roleofadam23 pages 35-39). These findings suggest that not only are the protein–protein interactions among paranodal adhesion molecules crucial, but the surrounding lipid milieu also plays a significant role in maintaining paranodal stability.

Finally, the pathological relevance of these findings is echoed in models of demyelinating diseases. Molecular myelin dysfunction studies in mouse models of CMT1A and HNPP reveal aberrant distribution of paranodal proteins, including Caspr1, which correlate with clinical features of human neuropathies (moss2024molecularmyelindysfunction pages 5-8, phamdinh2011biologyofdemyelinating pages 21-23). Moreover, disruptions at paranodal junctions can extend to autoimmune phenomena where antibodies against these molecules are implicated in segmental demyelination and conduction block, further bridging the link between genetic perturbations and clinical disease (saifetiarova2017axonaldomaindisorganization pages 1-2).

Together, these genetic and functional studies underscore that the integrity of paranodal cell adhesion molecules is indispensable for nodal domain formation and maintenance. Mutations or knockout models that disrupt Caspr1, Neurofascin-155, or Contactin-1 not only elucidate the molecular architecture of the paranode but also provide a direct mechanistic link to neuropathies such as CMT, thereby phenocopying the disease pathophysiology observed in human patients (faivresarrailh2013neuroglialinteractionsat pages 4-5, fehmi2018nodesparanodesand pages 7-8).
