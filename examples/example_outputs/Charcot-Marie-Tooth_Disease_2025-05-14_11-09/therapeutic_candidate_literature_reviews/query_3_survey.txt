Query: Survey phenotypic screening campaigns focused on small molecules or biologics that enhance myelin–axon adhesion or paranodal septate junction assembly in rodent or iPSC-derived models of demyelinating neuropathy, prioritizing studies that report rescue of electrophysiological deficits, ultrastructural improvements, and ADME/toxicity profiles predictive of peripheral nerve exposure

Current phenotypic screening campaigns in CNS remyelination have largely concentrated on promoting oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and myelin gene expression rather than specifically enhancing myelin–axon adhesion or paranodal septate junction assembly. Although a variety of rodent‐derived models (including primary OPC cultures from rat optic nerve, immortalized mouse cell lines such as Oli-neu/Oli-neuM, and OPCs from mouse epiblast stem cells) alongside human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived OPCs and organoids have been deployed for screening promyelinating compounds, none of the reported campaigns have demonstrated an explicit focus on modulating the specialized adhesion or paranodal junction assembly in models of demyelinating neuropathy (balestri2021thecurrentchallenges pages 16-17).

Several publications describe the successful repurposing of small molecules including glucocorticoids (e.g., clobetasol), EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, benztropine, and antifungals like miconazole—all identified in phenotypic screens performed in these cell systems. However, these studies primarily assess endpoints such as increased expression of myelin proteins and overall OPC maturation, rather than demonstrating a direct enhancement of myelin–axon adhesion or paranodal structure formation. In many cases, the phenotypic readouts are based on synthetic axon engagement assays or myelin wrapping around engineered fibers, which, although they recapitulate aspects of oligodendrocyte biology, do not provide data on the fine ultrastructural organization of paranodal septate junctions (balestri2021thecurrentchallenges pages 15-16).

Regarding functional recovery, certain campaigns have included electrophysiological measurements and ultrastructural analyses in classical in vivo models of CNS demyelination to demonstrate improvements in remyelination. Nonetheless, these studies lack a targeted focus on peripheral neuropathy endpoints. They rarely extend to evaluating the rescue of electrophysiological deficits or the detailed reconstitution of paranodal junction architecture, and systematic ADME/toxicity profiling predictive of peripheral nerve exposure is either limited or entirely absent from the reported screenings (kim2020developmentofa pages 85-88).

Advanced models like human iPSC-derived OPCs and 3D organoids provide a promising platform for future studies by better recapitulating human tissue architecture and disease-specific phenotypes. Yet, even in these more sophisticated systems, there is no explicit evidence that phenotypic screening campaigns have been tailored to enhance myelin–axon adhesion or paranodal septate junction assembly. In addition, while some studies mention functional endpoints, the types of electrophysiological rescue (demonstrated through either nerve conduction velocity improvements or restoration of action potential propagation) and ultrastructural assessments (such as electron microscopic verification of paranodal complex restoration) remain unreported in the context of drug screens targeting these specific aspects of myelin structure (kim2020developmentofa pages 96-99).

In summary, despite a rich development of diverse in vitro and in vivo CNS remyelination platforms for drug discovery, the literature does not currently offer any phenotypic screening campaigns focused specifically on small molecules or biologics that enhance myelin–axon adhesion or paranodal septate junction assembly in rodent or iPSC-derived models of demyelinating neuropathy. Furthermore, studies reporting rescue of electrophysiological deficits, ultrastructural improvements, and ADME/toxicity profiles predictive of peripheral nerve exposure have not been detailed. This represents an important unmet need and an area for future research as the field moves toward developing more functionally and structurally rigorous models that bridge central remyelination strategies with peripheral nerve therapeutics (balestri2021thecurrentchallenges pages 16-17, balestri2021thecurrentchallenges pages 19-20, kim2020developmentofa pages 85-88).
