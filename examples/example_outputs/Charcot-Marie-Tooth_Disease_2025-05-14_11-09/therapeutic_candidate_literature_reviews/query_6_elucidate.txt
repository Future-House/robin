Query: Elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying paranodal axoglial junction disruption in various Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease genetic subtypes (e.g., PMP22 duplication, MPZ mutations), focusing on pathways amenable to pharmacological modulation such as cytoskeletal dynamics or protein trafficking

Paranodal axoglial junction disruption in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease subtypes, particularly those associated with PMP22 duplications (e.g., CMT1A) and MPZ mutations (e.g., CMT1B), arises from a convergence of altered protein dosage, impaired protein trafficking, and cytoskeletal disorganization. These molecular defects converge to compromise the structural integrity of the myelin sheath and the specialized junctions between Schwann cells and axons.

In cases of PMP22 duplication, excess PMP22 leads to altered membrane protein stoichiometry that interferes with proper myelin architecture. This abnormal protein abundance triggers toxic gain-of-function effects such as protein aggregation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which in turn impact intracellular trafficking pathways. This disruption limits the appropriate delivery of essential myelin components to the Schwann cell plasma membrane, critically impairing the formation and maintenance of paranodal junctions (moss2025schwanncellsin pages 6-7, saporta2023peripheralneuropathies pages 9-11). The abnormal trafficking is also compounded by dysregulation of cytoskeletal dynamics; the excess PMP22 appears to interfere with the organization of actin and microtubule networks that are vital for polarized protein sorting and vesicular transport. Pharmacologically targeting these pathways, for example through agents that modulate mTORC1 signaling or stabilize cytoskeletal dynamics, presents an attractive strategy to restore normal protein trafficking and junctional integrity (bolino2021myelinbiology pages 10-11, torii2019cellularsignalregulatedschwann pages 12-15).

In the context of MPZ mutations, the situation is further complicated by defects in the folding, post-translational modification, and trafficking of myelin protein zero (P0). MPZ normally serves as the chief adhesive molecule in the compact myelin sheath by mediating homophilic interactions between extracellular domains. However, mutations in MPZ may lead either to misfolding with subsequent ER retention, or to misglycosylation, both of which result in diminished or aberrant transport of P0 to the myelin membrane (raasakka2020howdoesprotein pages 7-9, veneri2020misglycosylationincharcotmarietooth pages 17-22). Reduced P0 at the plasma membrane weakens the adhesive forces necessary for proper paranodal axoglial junction formation and maintenance. Such trafficking and processing defects can instigate compensatory or maladaptive cytoskeletal remodeling, which further destabilizes the junctional complexes. Interventions that enhance proper P0 folding and trafficking, or that correct its glycosylation defects, thus represent promising pharmacological targets for restoring myelin integrity (bolino2021myelinbiology pages 11-12, veneri2020misglycosylationincharcotmarietooth pages 24-26).

Apart from direct modulation of protein expression and trafficking, several signaling pathways emerge as critical regulators of Schwann cell function. The PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 and MEK/Erk pathways, for instance, influence not only myelin thickness and lipid biosynthesis but also cytoskeletal organization and vesicular transport processes. Dysregulated signaling in these pathways, as observed with both PMP22 overexpression and MPZ mutations, can impair the activity of cytoskeletal regulators (such as Rho GTPases) and protein trafficking machinery (e.g., microtubule-dependent motor proteins) thereby contributing to paranodal disruption (chen2017roleofcell pages 30-34, torii2019cellularsignalregulatedschwann pages 12-15). Pharmacological agents that can restore balanced signaling through these axes—such as mTOR inhibitors or modulators of actin dynamics—may ameliorate the underlying cytoskeletal and trafficking defects responsible for junctional instability.

Thus, the molecular basis of paranodal axoglial junction disruption in CMT involves a complex interplay between protein misprocessing (due to PMP22 duplication or MPZ mutations), defective trafficking through the secretory pathway, and cytoskeletal disorganization. Each of these pathways is amenable to pharmacological intervention, offering potential avenues for therapeutic development aimed at restoring junctional integrity and improving peripheral nerve function (bolino2021myelinbiology pages 10-11, veneri2020misglycosylationincharcotmarietooth pages 69-73).
