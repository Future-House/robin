Query: Biophysical and biochemical characterization of sarcomere disorganization in Inclusion Body Myositis AND high-resolution imaging and contractility measurements correlating structural defects with functional deficits AND potential rescue by pathway-specific interventions or candidate small molecules

Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is marked by profound molecular and structural derangements that disrupt sarcomere integrity, the critical contractile apparatus in muscle fibers. At the biochemical level, IBM muscle exhibits progressive protein aggregation involving misfolded proteins such as β‐amyloid, phosphorylated tau, TDP‐43, and p62—all of which interfere with proper sarcomere assembly and maintenance (lindgren2023lnclusionbodymyositisgenetic pages 15-19). These protein aggregates are frequently observed within rimmed vacuoles and are correlated with mitochondrial abnormalities, upregulation of MHC class I, and unfolded protein response (UPR) activation, all contributing to the breakdown of sarcomeric organization and muscle fiber function (britson2020thereandback pages 12-17).

Biophysical characterization of sarcomere disorganization has been pursued through advanced high‐resolution imaging modalities. Electron microscopy and high‐resolution muscle biopsies reveal disrupted sarcomeric arrangements, including irregular Z‐bands and misaligned contractile filaments. These structural defects are directly linked to functional impairments; for instance, alterations in calcium handling dynamics and force generation have been documented via contractility measurements using techniques such as electrically induced stimulation and fluorescent calcium indicators (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 243-246). Furthermore, integrated imaging methods, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography, have been employed to detect subtle morphological changes that correlate with reduced muscle strength and altered force kinetics, thereby establishing a direct relationship between sarcomere disruption and contractile deficits (Clinical Trial Search: ((Inclusion Body Myositis OR IBM) AND (sarcomere OR sarcomeric disorganization OR muscle contractility OR biophysical OR biochemical OR imaging OR pathway-specific intervention OR small molecule))).

The functional aspect is further illustrated by in vitro models that recapitulate muscle contraction and sarcomere assembly. Feeder-supported in vitro exercise models, for example, allow human myotubes derived from sIBM patients to form de novo sarcomeres in response to electrical pulse stimulation, providing a platform where contractile function and structural integrity can be assessed simultaneously. Such systems reveal that under contractile stress, sIBM myotubes may develop pathological accumulations of TDP-43, thereby linking contraction-induced mechanical stress to biochemical misregulation and sarcomere derangement (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 1-2).

Pathway-specific interventions have shown potential to rescue these deficits by restoring protein homeostasis and improving sarcomere organization. One promising candidate is arimoclomol—a drug that enhances heat shock protein responses—which has been shown to alleviate proteostatic stress, reduce protein aggregation, and indirectly improve sarcomere integrity in mutant VCP transgenic models with IBM-like pathology (britson2020thereandback pages 29-34). Additionally, gene therapies that inhibit the myostatin signaling pathway via follistatin delivery have induced muscle hypertrophy and partial normalization of fiber size in clinical settings involving IBM and related myopathies, suggesting an avenue to counteract sarcomeric disorganization through enhanced muscle regeneration (britson2020thereandback pages 29-34). Targeting selective autophagy and stress granule pathways also offers a rational strategy; modulation of these pathways—notably through small molecule activators of chaperone-assisted selective autophagy—may address defective protein degradation that underpins sarcomere disruption (margeta2020autophagydefectsin pages 17-19).

In summary, comprehensive biophysical and biochemical characterization in IBM has revealed that sarcomere disorganization stems from combined effects of proteostatic failure, mitochondrial dysfunction, and aberrant immune signaling. High-resolution imaging and contractility measurements have successfully correlated these structural abnormalities with functional deficits. Moreover, pathway-specific interventions, including the use of small molecules and gene therapies, present promising strategies to restore sarcomere integrity and improve muscle contractility in IBM (ciryam2019ametastablesubproteome pages 1-2).
