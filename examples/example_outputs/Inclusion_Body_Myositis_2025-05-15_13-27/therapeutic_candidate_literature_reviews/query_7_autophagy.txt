Query: Autophagy and proteasome impairment in Inclusion Body Myositis AND mechanistic studies detailing how disruption of protein clearance pathways contributes to muscle fiber degeneration and contractile weakness in patient-derived models AND potential interventions

Autophagy is the cellular pathway responsible for degrading and recycling intracellular components via lysosomes, while the proteasome is a multi-subunit complex that degrades short-lived and misfolded proteins tagged by ubiquitin. In Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), both these systems are impaired, leading to the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates that underpin muscle fiber degeneration and contractile weakness.

Mechanistic studies in patient-derived models have shown that autophagy dysfunction in IBM is evidenced by the accumulation of key autophagy markers such as p62/SQSTM1 and LC3-II. These markers serve as indicators of stalled autophagic flux, where autophagosomes form but fail to efficiently fuse with lysosomes for degradation. Concomitantly, the proteasome system, despite exhibiting an upregulation of its subunits, demonstrates markedly reduced proteolytic activity. This paradox results in a buildup of ubiquitinated proteins within muscle fibers, which contributes to the formation of protein inclusions and aggresomes. Such perturbations in protein clearance disrupt cellular homeostasis and trigger stress responses, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately leading to muscle fiber degeneration and loss of contractility (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 4-7, guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 8-9).

Protein aggregates observed in IBM include amyloid-β, phosphorylated tau, TDP-43, among others. Their accumulation is a direct consequence of impaired degradation pathways. The failure to clear these misfolded proteins induces ER stress, which activates the unfolded protein response and further exacerbates proteostasis impairment. Additionally, mitochondrial abnormalities such as reduced oxidative phosphorylation and increased reliance on glycolysis have been documented, thereby compounding the cellular energy deficit and contributing to muscle atrophy (benveniste2015amyloiddepositsand pages 3-4, mcleish2024exploringtheassociation pages 29-32).

Interventions under investigation are primarily aimed at restoring the function of these protein clearance pathways to halt or slow the progression of muscle degeneration. A leading candidate is Sirolimus (Rapamycin), an mTOR inhibitor that not only serves as an immunosuppressive agent by selectively inhibiting T effector cells while sparing regulatory T cells but also induces autophagy. Clinical trials such as NCT04789070 and NCT02481453 are evaluating whether rapamycin can enhance autophagic flux, reduce the accumulation of aggregated proteins, and thereby preserve muscle function in IBM patients (NCT04789070, NCT02481453).

Other potential strategies include the use of small molecule histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, which are explored for their ability to modulate proteostasis by upregulating molecular chaperones and enhancing protein degradation capacities. Modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome—in light of its activation by dysfunctional mitophagy and accumulated protein aggregates—represents another therapeutic approach aimed at breaking the cycle of inflammation and cellular stress. Furthermore, targeting key signaling pathways implicated in ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction can also help in mitigating the secondary damage arising from impaired proteostasis (mcleish2024exploringtheassociation pages 26-29, naddaf2025nlrp3inflammasomeactivation pages 1-2).

In summary, mechanistic data derived from patient models consistently implicate defective autophagy and proteasome functions as central to IBM pathology. These defects hinder the effective clearance of misfolded and aggregated proteins, leading to cellular stress, ER activation, mitochondrial dysregulation, and ultimately muscle fiber degeneration and weakness. Therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing protein clearance mechanisms, particularly through agents like rapamycin, offer promising avenues to address the underlying cellular dysfunction and restore muscle function in IBM (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 23-24, guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 24-26).
