Query: High-throughput screening AND contractility-based phenotypic assays AND human IBM patient-derived myotubes AND small-molecule libraries restoring muscle force OR contractile amplitude AND target validation, mechanism confirmation, pharmacokinetic and safety profiles in disease-relevant models

The available context does not provide direct evidence that a high‐throughput screening (HTS) campaign employing contractility‐based phenotypic assays on human IBM patient-derived myotubes has been successfully executed to identify small‐molecule candidates that restore muscle force or contractile amplitude. In essence, while robust genetic data support IBM involvement for targets such as GNE and MYH2 (OpenTargets Search: inclusion body myositis), there is no detailed report showing that small‐molecule libraries have been screened using these assays on patient‐derived myotubes, nor that any candidates have advanced through target validation, mechanism confirmation, and subsequent pharmacokinetic and safety profiling in disease‐relevant models (OpenTargets Search: inclusion body myositis, Clinical Trial Search: contractility-based phenotypic assays AND inclusion body myositis AND small-molecule OR pharmacokinetic OR safety).

The Open Targets Platform clearly highlights the genetic associations for IBM, particularly noting high-confidence evidence for GNE and MYH2. Despite this, it is emphasized that no small‐molecule modulators discovered from phenotypic or contractility‐based screening expressly targeting these genes in IBM are reported within the dataset (OpenTargets Search: inclusion body myositis). Additionally, while there is significant clinical trial activity in areas related to IBM and contractility parameters—as 149,265 trials were returned on ClinicalTrials.gov for related search queries—this large number reflects a broad research landscape rather than concrete results specific to HTS in IBM patient-derived myotubes (Clinical Trials Search: contractility-based phenotypic assays AND inclusion body myositis AND small-molecule OR pharmacokinetic OR safety).

Furthermore, closely related studies that have utilized contractility-based phenotypic assays appear in the context of other muscle disorders. For example, work in oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) employing myostatin inhibition (as with the anti-myostatin antibody RK35) demonstrates that such assays can reliably assess muscle force restoration in preclinical settings (harish2018modulatingthemyostatin pages 96-101, harish2018modulatingthemyostatin pages 164-168). However, these examples are confined to OPMD models and do not extend to human IBM patient-derived myotubes or the identification of small molecules through HTS. In the OPMD studies, while contractility-based assays (e.g., forelimb grip strength and maximal tetanic force) provided robust functional data, there is no evidence that similar systematic screening methods have been applied to IBM to isolate small-molecule compounds capable of restoring muscle function (harish2018modulatingthemyostatin pages 124-129).

Moreover, program listings and abstracts from diverse neuromuscular research conferences do not include reports on HTS efforts or phenotypic screening that directly utilize IBM patient-derived myotubes to identify such small molecules (schaeffer…201722ndwmscongress–2017–program pages 21-22, straub2019abstractsofthe pages 88-90, vissing201520thwmscongress–2015–program pages 20-22). The absence of these reports, coupled with the data from clinical trial searches and Open Targets results, suggests that although the concept of employing contractility-based phenotypic assays in human IBM models is scientifically valid and attractive for target validation and drug discovery, direct evidence of its successful execution in terms of small-molecule identification, mechanism confirmation, pharmacokinetic profiling, and safety assessment is currently lacking.

In summary, while there is significant interest in using phenotypic contractility-based assays and extensive clinical and genetic data in IBM research, the specific integration of HTS using human IBM patient-derived myotubes to identify and validate small molecules with restored muscle function has not been explicitly documented or validated in the provided context (OpenTargets Search: inclusion body myositis, Clinical Trials Search: contractility-based phenotypic assays AND inclusion body myositis AND small-molecule OR pharmacokinetic OR safety).
