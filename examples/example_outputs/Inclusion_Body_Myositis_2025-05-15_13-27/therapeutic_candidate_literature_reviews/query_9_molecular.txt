Query: Molecular validation of therapeutic targets in IBM AND evidence from CRISPR or RNAi studies confirming causative roles of VCP, SQSTM1, TARDBP, or mitochondrial genes in contractile impairment within patient-derived myotubes AND downstream pathway analyses

The literature clearly establishes that VCP, SQSTM1, and TARDBP are strongly associated with IBM pathogenesis based on pathological, immunohistochemical, and proteomic analyses. Immunostaining of patient muscle biopsies consistently demonstrates p62 (encoded by SQSTM1) and TDP‐43 (encoded by TARDBP) aggregates in affected fibers, and mRNA overexpression studies support dysregulation of these genes in IBM pathology (OpenTargets Search: inclusion body myositis-VCP,SQSTM1,TARDBP). However, while these associations are well documented, the context reviewed does not provide direct evidence from CRISPR- or RNA interference (RNAi)–based experiments in patient-derived myotubes that definitively confirm a causative role of these genes in contractile impairment.

In the case of VCP, recent studies using patient‐derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with the VCP R155H mutation have applied CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to generate isogenic pairs. These studies use gene correction or targeted introduction of the mutation to model disease phenotypes in differentiated myotubes. Proteomic and gene expression analyses in these VCP-edited cells reveal significant dysregulation in muscle structural proteins, autophagy pathways, and mitochondrial function that are linked to impaired muscle cell contractility (luzzi2023skeletalmusclecell pages 5-8, luzzi2023skeletalmusclecell pages 10-11). Although these studies confirm that VCP mutation leads to molecular and proteomic remodeling consistent with contractile dysfunction in muscle cells, they do not document similar CRISPR or RNAi interventions directed at SQSTM1, TARDBP, or mitochondrial genes.

For SQSTM1 and TARDBP, the evidence supporting their roles in IBM largely derives from immunohistochemical analyses and mRNA expression profiling rather than from functional studies using gene knockdown or knockout. The published literature reveals that SQSTM1/p62 aggregates and TDP-43 inclusions are diagnostic markers that correlate with autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in IBM muscle tissue (OpenTargets Search: inclusion body myositis-VCP,SQSTM1,TARDBP; britson2020thereandback pages 21-25). However, no CRISPR or RNAi studies in patient-derived myotubes have been reported that demonstrate causality between the perturbation of these genes and contractile impairment, nor have any studies conducted comprehensive downstream pathway analyses following such genetic interventions.

In addition, while mitochondrial dysfunction is a recurring theme in IBM—with evidence of mitochondrial DNA deletions and impaired oxidative phosphorylation in patient muscle fibers—there are no reports within the reviewed context of CRISPR or RNAi targeting mitochondrial genes in patient-derived myotubes that include both contractility assessments and subsequent pathway-level analyses (britson2020thereandback pages 113-115; zhu2022vcpagatekeeper pages 24-28). The downstream pathway analyses that are available, for instance through proteomic profiling in VCP mutant models, do indicate disruptions in autophagy, mTOR, and mitochondrial function. Yet, such studies have been confined primarily to VCP mutation models rather than expanding to RNAi or CRISPR editing of other candidate genes.

In summary, although extensive molecular validation supports the involvement of VCP, SQSTM1, and TARDBP in IBM pathology—with demonstrable impacts on autophagy and mitochondrial function—the reviewed evidence does not include direct CRISPR or RNAi studies in patient-derived myotubes that confirm a causal relationship between gene perturbation and contractile impairment. The only example with genome editing pertains to VCP corrections in iPSC-derived myotubes, which, while insightful, does not extend to analogous manipulations of SQSTM1, TARDBP, or mitochondrial genes (luzzi2023skeletalmusclecell pages 5-8, luzzi2023skeletalmusclecell pages 10-11; britson2020thereandback pages 21-25).
