Assay Overview:
This myotube contractility assay is designed to measure the functional contractile properties of iPSC‐derived myotubes cultured on flexible substrates. The assay applies electrical field stimulation to mimic in vivo muscle contraction and uses video‐based analysis software to quantitatively assess contraction amplitude and frequency. The measured endpoints provide a functional readout of muscle cell performance, which is critical given that Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and impaired contractility. The biological material used is patient‐derived iPSCs that are differentiated into myotubes; these cells retain patient-specific genetic and molecular signatures representative of IBM pathology, offering high biomedical relevance (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 1-2, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).

Biomedical Evidence:
The central pathogenesis of IBM involves not only structural changes like rimmed vacuoles and protein aggregation but also a clear functional consequence—diminished contractile force in muscle fibers, which translates clinically to progressive weakness and decline in daily function. Electrical stimulation of myotubes provides a physiologically relevant approach to mimic exercise-induced muscle contraction. Studies have shown that under electrical stimulus, even sIBM-derived myotubes reveal unusual responses such as abnormal cytoplasmic localization of TDP-43, a hallmark of disease that is not readily seen under static conditions (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 1-2, li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 11-12). Furthermore, contractility assays have been linked to functional outcomes that correlate with muscle strength in clinical settings, as seen in evaluations of interventions like high-dose IVIg, where improvements in muscle strength were required for therapeutic impact (NCT00001261). By continuing this line of inquiry, the assay is positioned to serve as a robust tool for screening drugs that can restore or improve contractile deficits in IBM (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 235-238, Clinical Trial Search: Inclusion Body Myositis AND (myotube OR muscle fiber OR in vitro OR contractility OR iPSC)).

Previous Use:
Contractility assays employing electrically stimulated muscle cells have been widely used in the investigation of various muscle diseases, including but not limited to muscular dystrophies and myotonic disorders. Platforms such as the MyoTACTIC system have been successfully implemented to evaluate muscle force generation and calcium handling in engineered human muscle microtissues, underscoring the relevance of such functional assays in preclinical drug development (afshar2020a96wellculture pages 5-7). Although direct application of these assays to IBM is not as extensive, previous studies using feeder-supported satellite cell models have shown that exercise-mimicking stimulation protocols can reveal IBM-specific phenotypes, such as TDP-43 mislocalization upon contraction, demonstrating that contractile function is a measurable and disease-relevant endpoint (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 1-2). This supports the extrapolation of contractility assays for early-stage drug discovery in IBM, akin to how similar methodologies have informed mechanistic insights and pharmacological testing in other muscle diseases (broer2020canwemimic pages 2-4, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 69-73).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths:
• The assay directly measures a function—contractility—that is central to muscle performance and clinical manifestations of IBM. This offers a more relevant functional endpoint compared to indirect markers such as myotube diameter or myosin heavy chain expression (hamaguchi2022establishmentofa pages 1-2).
• Using patient-derived iPSC-derived myotubes ensures that the model captures patient-specific disease features, increasing the translational relevance for drug screening (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2).
• The non-invasive, video-based quantification method can be potentially scaled for medium-throughput screenings, expediting early-stage therapeutic discovery (afshar2020a96wellculture pages 5-7).

Weaknesses:
• While the contractility assay is effective at quantifying muscle function, it may not fully replicate the multifactorial in vivo environment of IBM which includes significant contributions from immune-mediated inflammation and extracellular matrix interactions. In vitro systems generally lack immune and stromal components critical to IBM pathogenesis (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 235-238, broer2020canwemimic pages 2-4).
• Differentiation variability among iPSC lines may lead to heterogeneity in myotube maturation and contractile properties, posing challenges in assay standardization and reproducibility (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2).
• The focus on contractile function alone may overlook other important pathological features such as protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and autophagy impairment, which are also key in IBM (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 11-12, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 56-57).

In summary, the proposed electrically stimulated myotube contractility assay offers a robust, functionally relevant platform for early-stage IBM drug discovery by directly measuring muscle contraction deficits. However, its limitations in recapitulating the full complexity of IBM pathology necessitate its use in conjunction with other molecular and cellular assays to provide a comprehensive evaluation of therapeutic candidates.
