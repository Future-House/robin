Assay Overview:
This proposal centers on an immune co-culture apoptosis assay designed to recapitulate a central aspect of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) pathogenesis—namely, the direct cytotoxic interaction between autologous CD8+ T cells and muscle fibers. In this assay, primary human myotubes are co-cultured with patient-derived, antigen-exposed CD8+ T cells in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α. The addition of these cytokines mimics the IBM muscle microenvironment by upregulating MHC class I expression on myotubes, thereby increasing their susceptibility to immune-mediated attack. This set-up is intended to trigger cell death, which is quantified via high-content imaging through markers such as cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL positivity. The use of primary human cells allows the assay to capture the patient-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses reflective of the antigen-driven, oligoclonal expansion seen in IBM muscle tissue (benveniste2015amyloiddepositsand pages 4-6, benveniste2019inclusionbodymyositis pages 2-3).

Biomedical Evidence:
The inflammatory and degenerative interplay in IBM is characterized by the infiltration of highly differentiated CD8+ T cells, which express cytotoxic molecules such as perforin, granzymes, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (britson2020thereandback pages 12-17, damian2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 3-5). This cellular component is central to IBM pathogenesis, as these T cells engage in direct cytotoxic interactions with muscle fibers that overexpress MHC class I under the influence of IFN-γ and TNF-α (bhattarai2017functionalroleof pages 19-24, guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 13-15). The assay’s focus on apoptosis detection (cleaved caspase-3 or TUNEL) aligns with observed immune-mediated muscle fiber injury, despite some debate whether the predominant mode of cell death is apoptotic or necroptotic (kamiya2023musclefibernecroptosis pages 2-3, mccord2023cytotoxicimmunecells pages 1-2). Importantly, clinical and pathological analyses highlight that the antigen recognition by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells drives muscle damage and may be a key trigger for downstream degenerative processes (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 27-28, nelke2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 1-2). This assay therefore models a pathogenic mechanism that is both immunologically and clinically relevant.

Previous Use:
Co-culture systems involving myotubes and cytotoxic T cells have been used in earlier studies to investigate the direct effects of immune cell infiltration on muscle cells. For instance, in vitro models employing similar co-culture settings have demonstrated that CD8+ T cells can induce muscle cell apoptosis, as evidenced by cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL positivity (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 153-157). Such assays have played a role in elucidating the involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic T cell-induced muscle damage in IBM. While direct correlation between in vitro findings and in vivo IBM pathology remains complex, these models have contributed to our understanding of the immunologic mechanisms underlying muscle fiber injury, informing the development of immunomodulators targeting the T cell–muscle cell axis (hou2021interferongammamediatesskeletal pages 11-14, danielsson2016theclinicaland pages 42-45).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths:
• The assay directly targets a well-characterized pathogenic mechanism in IBM—the CD8+ T cell–mediated cytotoxic attack on muscle fibers—thereby offering clear mechanistic insight into potential therapeutic interventions (benveniste2015amyloiddepositsand pages 4-6, britson2020thereandback pages 12-17).
• It employs primary human cells, which increases its physiological relevance and potential for personalized drug screening (nelke2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 1-2).
• The use of high-content imaging allows robust quantitative measurement of cell death, facilitating evaluation of therapeutic compounds aimed at mitigating immune-mediated cytotoxicity (mccord2023cytotoxicimmunecells pages 11-12).

Weaknesses:
• There is ongoing debate regarding the exact mode of muscle fiber death in IBM, with some evidence suggesting that necroptosis rather than classical apoptosis may be predominant (kamiya2023musclefibernecroptosis pages 3-4). Thus, reliance solely on apoptotic markers might not fully recapitulate the in vivo pathology.
• The complex interplay between inflammatory cytokines, T-cell activation status, and muscle fiber stress may not be completely captured in vitro, potentially limiting the predictive validity of the assay for clinical responses (danielsson2016theclinicaland pages 42-45).

Overall, the immune co-culture apoptosis assay represents a robust and scientifically grounded model for screening therapeutics targeting the T cell–mediated pathogenic axis of IBM. However, adaptations to also assess non-apoptotic cell death markers might enhance the assay’s capability to fully model IBM pathology and improve the translation of in vitro findings to clinical outcomes (damian2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 3-5, mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 153-157).
