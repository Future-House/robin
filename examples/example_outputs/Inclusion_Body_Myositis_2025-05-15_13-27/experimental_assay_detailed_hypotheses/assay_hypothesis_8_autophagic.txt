Assay Overview:
The proposed autophagic flux imaging assay involves live‐cell imaging of GFP‐LC3 cleavage and puncta formation under both basal conditions and in the presence of bafilomycin A1, a lysosomal inhibitor. This assay directly measures the dynamics of autophagy by assessing autophagosome formation and clearance. The use of a fluorescent LC3 reporter enables visualization of autophagosome accumulation, where an increase in puncta upon bafilomycin A1 treatment indicates active flux. In the context of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), this assay would typically be applied to muscle-related cells such as myotubes—especially those derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to better recapitulate muscle-specific pathology—or patient-derived fibroblasts which have also demonstrated autophagic dysfunction. The assay quantitatively determines the rate at which autophagosomes are generated and degraded over time when challenged with proteostatic stress (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).

Biomedical Evidence:
Impaired autophagy plays a central role in the pathogenesis of IBM. Multiple independent studies have highlighted defects in autophagosome formation and accumulation of autophagy-related markers such as LC3B-II and p62 in both muscle tissue and patient-derived fibroblasts. Reduced autophagic activity leads to insufficient clearance of damaged proteins and organelles, propagating cellular stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately muscle degeneration (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2). The clinical landscape underscores that targeting autophagy modulation may have therapeutic benefits, as conventional immunosuppressive treatments have shown limited efficacy, and there is significant interest in drugs that restore proteostasis (Clinical Trial Search: autophagy OR lysosomal enhancement OR proteostasis OR autophagic flux AND myositis OR muscle myopathy). Therefore, assessing autophagic flux using GFP‐LC3 reporter assays directly relates to a core pathogenic mechanism in IBM. By quantitatively measuring dynamic changes in autophagic flux, researchers can determine if candidate drugs enhance the autophagy pathway and promote the removal of toxic aggregates, which is essential for halting or reversing muscle degeneration in IBM (margeta2020autophagydefectsin pages 17-19, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 66-67).

Previous Use:
The GFP‐LC3 puncta assay, in combination with bafilomycin A1, has been widely used in autophagy research, including in the evaluation of muscle diseases and related myopathies. Prior studies in models of skeletal myopathy—including plectin-deficient muscle cells—have employed similar approaches to delineate autophagic flux and discern whether defective clearance is responsible for protein aggregate accumulation (zrelski2025impairedautophagicflux pages 13-16). Although direct examples from IBM models are less common, multiple reports using patient-derived fibroblasts and iPSC-derived myotubes have shown that autophagic dysfunction is a replicable feature of IBM pathology. Furthermore, such assays have facilitated the screening of autophagy inducers and lysosomal enhancers that could restore normal flux and potentially ameliorate muscle pathology (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2). The underlying principle has also been validated in studies of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy and other inflammatory myopathies, where similar approaches validated the association between altered autophagic dynamics and muscle degeneration (girolamo2019autophagymarkerslc3 pages 12-18).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths:
• The assay offers a dynamic and quantifiable assessment of autophagic flux by distinguishing between autophagosome synthesis and degradation.
• It provides multiparametric data that are crucial when screening drugs aimed at enhancing autophagy, which is a central pathological mechanism in IBM.
• Adaptation in iPSC-derived myotubes increases physiological relevance given the complex muscle-specific features of IBM, while usage in fibroblasts offers a cost-effective and patient-specific model (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).

Weaknesses:
• Overexpression of fluorescent reporters like GFP‐LC3 can potentially introduce artifacts or alter basal autophagic activity.
• Cellular heterogeneity between fibroblasts and muscle cells may limit the direct translational relevance, necessitating careful model selection and validation.
• The indirect nature of flux inhibition by bafilomycin A1 may mask nuanced differences in selective versus general autophagic pathways, implying that complementary assays (e.g., assessing specific cargo clearance) might be necessary (margeta2020autophagydefectsin pages 17-19, zrelski2025impairedautophagicflux pages 13-16).

In summary, the GFP‐LC3 cleavage and puncta formation assay with bafilomycin A1 is a scientifically robust and translationally relevant approach for screening autophagy-modulating therapeutics in IBM. Its strengths in measuring dynamic autophagic flux align well with the pathophysiological features of IBM, although careful attention to model selection and assay optimization is required to overcome inherent limitations.
