Assay Overview:
This assay utilizes a UPR reporter system, specifically either an XBP1-luciferase or a CHOP-GFP reporter, stably integrated into cultured myoblasts. It is designed to monitor the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a critical node in the pathogenesis of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), by providing quantifiable luminescent (via XBP1-luciferase) or fluorescent (via CHOP-GFP) outputs. The assay models a central aspect of IBM pathogenesis related to proteostasis dysfunction and ER stress, conditions that are critical in identifying pathogenic stimuli and screening potential therapeutic compounds. In practice, the reporter signal will be measured upon exposure of myoblast cultures to various stressors or proteostatic challenges (for example, chemical insults that promote misfolded protein accumulation), with signal changes indicating modulation of the UPR. The assay can be adapted to high-throughput screening formats, enabling rapid and quantitative analysis of chemical chaperones or UPR modulators that could ameliorate ER stress in IBM-relevant cell types (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 4-6, naitsaidi2023thesmallcompound pages 1-2).

Biomedical Evidence:
There is substantial biomedical evidence that ER stress and UPR activation are central to IBM pathogenesis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that markers of ER stress, such as spliced XBP1 (sXBP1) and CHOP, are elevated in IBM as well as other related myopathies, suggesting that proteostasis imbalance is a driving force in disease progression (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 15-18, ruparelia2024atrogin1promotesmuscle pages 18-19). Clinical analyses of muscle biopsies from IBM patients reveal elevated ER chaperones and stress markers, linking UPR activation to the formation of protein aggregates and vacuolar pathology characteristic of the disease (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 26-30, rusmini2016theroleof pages 13-17). This association is reinforced by genetic and immunohistochemical analyses showing that multiple branches of the UPR, including the IRE1-XBP1 pathway and the PERK-CHOP branch, contribute to the cellular response under stress conditions and regulate apoptotic as well as compensatory mechanisms in muscle, making the monitoring of these pathways highly relevant (krishna2023indicatorsofincreased pages 10-11).

Previous Use:
UPR reporter assays have been previously employed in various models of ER stress-linked pathologies. For instance, XBP1-luciferase constructs have been used to detect IRE1-mediated splicing events in different cell types and have served as quantitative indicators of the cellular response to proteotoxic stress (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 4-6). Similarly, CHOP-GFP assays have been utilized to monitor the pro-apoptotic signaling downstream of PERK activation and have provided insights into how modulation of this branch can impact cell viability and stress-induced apoptotic pathways (harish2019pharmacologicalmodulationof pages 32-35). Although direct application to IBM is underexplored in the literature, the widespread use of these reporters in drug discovery for other protein aggregation diseases underscores their potential utility in IBM research. They have enabled the identification of small molecules that modulate the UPR and restore proteostasis in models of related muscular dystrophies, suggesting that similar approaches could yield promising therapeutic candidates for IBM (naitsaidi2023thesmallcompound pages 1-2).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of this assay include its high sensitivity and quantifiable output, which enables precise measurement of UPR activation in response to proteostatic challenges. The use of myoblasts as a model system is directly relevant because these cells capture key aspects of muscle pathology. Furthermore, the dual reporting capability (via luminescence or fluorescence) facilitates flexibility in high-throughput screening formats, essential for early-stage drug discovery. The assay allows for real-time monitoring of distinct UPR branches, thereby providing mechanistic insights into which specific pathways can be modulated to alleviate ER stress-related pathology.
However, weaknesses include the fact that in vitro cell culture systems may not fully recapitulate the complex tissue context of IBM, where additional factors such as inflammatory signaling and in vivo tissue architecture also play roles. Moreover, while reporter assays reliably quantify UPR activation, they do not directly measure downstream pathological events, such as protein aggregation or cell death, which are critical in IBM. Thus, while this assay is a valuable tool for primary screening and mechanistic studies, positive hits would require further validation in more complex models including animal studies and eventually clinical settings (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 8-11, preusse2022endoplasmicreticulum‐stressand pages 9-11).
