Assay Overview:
This assay leverages automated immunofluorescence imaging coupled with high-content image segmentation (e.g., using AggreCount) to quantify protein aggregates in differentiating myoblasts. The assay specifically targets hallmark aggregates of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), including amyloid-β oligomers, phosphorylated tau (phospho-tau), and TDP-43. Measurements include aggregate number, size, and subcellular distribution, providing multiparametric data on proteostasis integrity. The primary biological material comprises differentiated myoblast cultures, including patient-derived cells and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived myotubes that recapitulate key molecular features of IBM pathology (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 69-73).

Biomedical Evidence:
The central pathogenic mechanism in IBM involves the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates that disrupt proteostasis. Pathologically, IBM muscles exhibit abnormal deposits of amyloid-β, phospho-tau, and TDP-43, which are intimately linked to muscle degeneration and inflammatory processes (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 19-20, guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 23-24). Clinical studies and autopsy findings underscore that these aggregates not only serve as biomarkers but also contribute actively to disease progression (britson2020thereandback pages 12-17). The use of automated immunofluorescence provides an objective approach to quantifying these aggregates in vitro, ensuring that subtle changes in proteostasis can be detected. This becomes especially relevant given that the precise early detection of protein aggregation is critical for assessing candidate proteostasis modulators in a therapeutic context across similar neurodegenerative spectra (Clinical Trial Search: inclusion body myositis cell culture aggregation assay OR proteostasis imaging).

Previous Use:
Automated immunofluorescence-based aggregate quantification has been successfully applied in neurodegenerative disease research where proteostasis impairment plays a pivotal role. Platforms analogous to AggreCount have been employed to discern alterations in aggregate burden upon administration of therapeutic agents, thereby validating potential drug candidates (britson2020thereandback pages 29-34, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 56-57). In the context of IBM, recent work has illustrated that patient-derived iPSC-myotubes accurately model protein aggregation phenomena, thus providing a preclinical assay relevant for therapeutic screening (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 53-56). Although direct usages of high-content imaging specifically targeting amyloid-β oligomers or phospho-tau in IBM remain emerging, the converging evidence from neurodegenerative models supports the feasibility and translational value of this approach (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 235-238).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of the assay include its scalability and multiparametric nature, which allow for detailed, quantitative analysis of protein aggregate burden—a central hallmark of IBM pathology. Automated image segmentation minimizes user bias and increases reproducibility, critical for early-stage therapeutic screening. Furthermore, by using disease-relevant in vitro models such as patient-derived myoblasts or iPSC-derived myotubes, the assay closely mirrors the cellular pathogenesis observed in IBM patients (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 57-57, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 69-73).

However, potential weaknesses exist. The in vitro culture conditions may not fully recapitulate the inflammatory environment present in vivo, which has been shown to modulate aggregate formation as observed in some studies (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 235-238). Moreover, protein aggregation is only one facet of IBM pathology—mitochondrial dysfunction and immune-mediated muscle injury also contribute significantly, and these may require complementary assays for a holistic evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. Thus, while the assay is highly promising for monitoring proteostasis and aggregate modulation, it may need to be integrated within a broader panel of functional and molecular endpoints to fully predict clinical outcomes in IBM (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 1-2, britson2020thereandback pages 12-17).
