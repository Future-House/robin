Assay Overview:
The proposed assay utilizes mitochondrial membrane potential measurement through fluorescent dyes such as TMRE or JC-1 in human skeletal muscle cell cultures. In this assay, cells are exposed to proinflammatory cytokines to mimic the inflammatory environment observed in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). This treatment is intended to induce mitochondrial dysfunction that parallels the clinical condition, notably a decrease in Δψm, impaired ATP production, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The assay quantitatively measures Δψm using live-cell imaging approaches, where the accumulation of TMRE or the ratiometric shift seen with JC-1 staining provides a sensitive readout of mitochondrial depolarization or hyperpolarization. Utilizing human skeletal muscle cells ensures that the cellular model closely reflects the tissue affected in IBM and incorporates the motivational effect of applying inflammatory stress on mitochondrial function (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 1-6, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 58-58, vianello2023highthroughputmicroscopyanalysis pages 1-2).

Biomedical Evidence:
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central feature in the pathogenesis of IBM. Clinical and biochemical evidence confirm that patients with IBM manifest signs of impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, defective ATP synthesis, and increased oxidative stress, which in part result from a depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential (catalangarcia2016mitochondrialdnadisturbances pages 1-2, garcia2017mitochondrialprofileand pages 33-43). Furthermore, the inflammatory milieu characteristic of IBM, driven by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, exacerbates mitochondrial damage. This is mechanistically relevant because inflammatory mediators not only impair mitochondrial dynamics but also directly induce mitochondrial membrane potential loss, leading to reduced energy production and increased apoptotic susceptibility (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 25-29, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 64-64). The use of TMRE or JC-1 staining in this context offers a direct method to assess these mitochondrial changes in real-time, linking the biochemical defect to the clinical pathology of muscle degeneration observed in IBM (Open Targets Search: Inclusion Body Myositis).

Previous Use:
Mitochondrial membrane potential assays employing TMRE and JC-1 have been extensively used in the context of various muscle pathologies and models of inflammation. In studies of IBM and other inflammatory myopathies, such assays have provided significant insights into mitochondrial bioenergetics and the effect of putative drugs on restoring mitochondrial function (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 56-57, oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 1-6). For example, experiments with drug candidates such as mitochondrial homing agents have shown improvements in ATP levels and reduction in ROS production in patient-derived myoblasts and fibroblasts, even if their effects were validated through a combination of morphological and bioenergetic analyses rather than solely Δψm measurements (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 1-6, lightfoot2015ss31attenuatestnfα pages 6-11). Additionally, high-throughput microscopy methods have been applied to these assays, underscoring their adaptability for drug screening applications in muscle diseases (vianello2023highthroughputmicroscopyanalysis pages 1-2).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths:
• The assay directly measures a critical parameter (Δψm) that serves as an early biomarker for mitochondrial dysfunction, central to IBM pathogenesis.
• It uses live-cell imaging, which enables high-throughput and real-time analysis of mitochondrial health under inflammatory conditions.
• The incorporation of human skeletal muscle cells closely mimics the cell type affected in IBM, thereby enhancing the translational relevance of the findings (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 1-6, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 58-58).

Weaknesses:
• Although robust, Δψm assays can sometimes be confounded by dye loading variability and photobleaching, which may affect reproducibility.
• The inflammatory cytokine model, while informative, may not fully recapitulate the chronic and multifactorial nature of IBM pathology, necessitating complementary assays for a comprehensive evaluation of mitochondrial function and muscle degeneration (garcia2017mitochondrialprofileand pages 33-43).

In summary, the mitochondrial membrane potential assay using TMRE or JC-1 in cytokine-treated human skeletal muscle cells represents a highly relevant and scientifically grounded tool for early-stage drug screening in Inclusion Body Myositis. It capitalizes on a direct, quantifiable readout of mitochondrial health that is both central to disease pathology and amenable to high-throughput analysis, despite some limitations inherent to in vitro models and fluorescent assays (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 25-29, vianello2023highthroughputmicroscopyanalysis pages 1-2).
