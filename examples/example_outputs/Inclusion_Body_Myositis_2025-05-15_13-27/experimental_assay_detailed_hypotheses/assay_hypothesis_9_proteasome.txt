Assay Overview:
This assay is a plate‐based measurement of proteasome catalytic activity in muscle cell lysates. It focuses on quantifying the three primary proteolytic activities mediated by the 26S proteasome: chymotrypsin‐like, trypsin‐like, and caspase‐like (also referred to as PGPH in some literature). The methodology relies on fluorogenic peptides that emit a fluorescent signal upon cleavage by the active proteasome. The assay is conducted using lysates from cultured muscle cells or patient‐derived muscle fibers that exhibit the protein aggregate formation characteristic of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). The readouts offer quantitative data reflective of the ubiquitin–proteasome system’s (UPS) functionality, which is essential for degrading misfolded or damaged proteins (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8, nogalska2010inaβpp‐overexpressingcultured pages 1-2).

Biomedical Evidence:
The central pathology of IBM involves abnormal protein aggregation and impaired muscle proteostasis. These features are linked to dysfunction of the UPS, as evidenced by the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, misfolded protein aggregates, and decreased enzymatic activities within the proteasome. Biochemical studies show that in both sporadic and inclusion body variants of myositis, impaired proteasome function correlates with disease severity. This link is supported by literature documenting reduced proteolytic capacities in IBM muscle tissue, which contributes directly to cellular stress and muscle fiber degeneration (ahmed2016targetingproteinhomeostasis pages 1-3, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 13-14). Clinically, muscle biopsies from IBM patients reveal aggregation of proteins that are normally cleared by the proteasome, reinforcing the relevance of assessing proteasome activity as a measure of disease status and therapeutic response (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8).

Previous Use:
Proteasome catalytic activity assays have been applied extensively in the study of neuromuscular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders where UPS impairment is a hallmark. In vitro models simulating IBM have employed these fluorogenic peptide assays to demonstrate how proteasome inhibition leads to toxic protein accumulation. For instance, studies using cultured human muscle fibers overexpressing proteins such as amyloid‐β precursor protein (AβPP) have confirmed that diminished proteasome activity is closely linked to the pathogenesis seen in IBM (nogalska2010inaβpp‐overexpressingcultured pages 1-2). Moreover, similar assays have been used in drug screening applications in other models of protein aggregation disorders, where compounds that restore proteasome activity were identified as promising candidates for ameliorating aggregate accumulation. Although clinical trials with direct measurements of proteasome activity in IBM are sparse (Clinical Trials Search: proteasome activity AND Inclusion Body Myositis), the preclinical use of this assay in comparable disease models validates its utility for drug discovery (li2013unfoldedproteinresponse pages 1-2).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of the proteasome catalytic activity assay include its direct measurement of a key enzymatic process central to IBM pathogenesis, rapid plate-based format, and quantitative output that supports high-throughput drug screening. By providing a functional readout of UPS integrity, it can serve as a surrogate marker for therapeutic efficacy in early-stage in vitro models, correlating improvements in proteasome activity with potential reductions in pathogenic protein aggregates (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8). On the other hand, a significant weakness is that the UPS is only one facet of the multifactorial pathogenesis of IBM. The disease also involves autophagy dysfunction, inflammatory responses, and other cellular stress pathways; therefore, relying solely on proteasome activity may not fully capture the therapeutic benefits of a candidate compound (ju2010inclusionbodymyopathy pages 5-6). Additionally, while in vitro models provide controlled conditions, translating these findings into in vivo efficacy remains a challenge due to the complex interplay of muscle degeneration and immune responses in patients (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 23-24). In summary, when used as part of a broader panel of assays, the proteasome catalytic activity assay is a scientifically robust and practically valuable tool for early-stage drug discovery in IBM (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8, nogalska2010inaβpp‐overexpressingcultured pages 1-2).
