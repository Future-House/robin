Query: Characterization of the interplay between chronic CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell infiltration, proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α), MHC-I upregulation and muscle cell stress responses in IBM co-culture assays, including quantification of muscle cell apoptosis, cytokine release, T-cell activation markers and immune synapse formation

The interplay in inclusion body myositis (IBM) is defined by chronic infiltration of highly differentiated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that are resistant to apoptosis, possess markers such as KLRG1 and CD57, and secrete proinflammatory cytokines like interferon‐gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF-α) (kamiya2023musclefibernecroptosis pages 2-3). These cytokines drive activation of signaling pathways in muscle fibers, notably via JAK-STAT and CaMKIV cascades, which trigger upregulation of Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) molecules on the surface of muscle cells; such upregulation facilitates antigen presentation and further immune recognition (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluencea pages 42-45). This enhanced MHC-I expression is critical as it creates a feed-forward loop: it not only increases susceptibility to immune attack by primed CD8+ T cells, but also contributes to a sustained inflammatory milieu when coupled with cytokine release (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 22-27).

Co-culture assays modeling IBM commonly utilize either primary patient-derived cells or surrogate cell lines like TALL-104 cells, which, despite not being true CD8+ T cells, share cytotoxic properties with CTLs (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 157-162). Within these assays, the direct physical interactions between cytotoxic lymphocytes and muscle cells are hypothesized to result in the formation of immune synapses. These synapses are specialized junctions where cell surface costimulatory molecules, including CD40, CD86, and ICAM-1, become clustered; this organization promotes targeted delivery of cytotoxic mediators (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluencea pages 45-49). Immune synapse formation can be visualized and quantified using confocal microscopy techniques and is considered a critical parameter for understanding cytolytic function in the co-culture environment (zschuntzsch2022theevolutionof pages 2-3).

Muscle cell stress responses are evident both at the biochemical and morphological levels. Chronic cytokine exposure, particularly to IFN-γ and TNF-α, induces intracellular stress responses such as protein aggregation involving TDP-43 and p62, dysregulated autophagy markers (e.g., an increased LC3II/LC3I ratio), and mitochondrial dysfunction (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluencea pages 238-243, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 53-56). These stress responses eventually lead to apoptosis or non-apoptotic forms of cell death such as necroptosis, which can be quantitatively measured through assays such as TUNEL staining, LDH release, or caspase activity assays (kamiya2023musclefibernecroptosis pages 2-3, mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 250-253).

Assessing the immune-muscle cell interplay in co-culture requires a multiparametric approach. First, quantification of muscle cell apoptosis is achieved by applying cell viability assays and direct morphological observation of apoptotic markers (e.g., cleaved caspase 3) (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluencea pages 157-162). Second, cytokine release from both muscle cells and infiltrating immune cells is determined using ELISA to highlight changes in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-1β levels within the conditioned media (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 42-45). Third, T-cell activation markers such as CD40, CD86, and PD-1 on both lymphocytes and muscle cells are quantified by flow cytometry or immunofluorescence imaging to assess the degree of immune activation (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluencea pages 45-49). Lastly, immune synapse formation is analyzed through high-resolution imaging techniques that document the spatial arrangement and clustering of these markers at the interface between T cells and muscle fibers, which indicates efficient antigen-driven cytotoxic interactions (zschuntzsch2022theevolutionof pages 2-3, santos2023novelcellmodelsa pages 22-27).

Collectively, these in vitro co-culture models provide a comprehensive framework to dissect the complex interplay among chronic CD8+ T-cell infiltration, proinflammatory cytokine signaling, MHC-I upregulation, and muscle cell stress responses implicated in IBM pathogenesis (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluencea pages 250-253). This multifaceted approach not only enhances our understanding of disease mechanisms but also serves as a platform for testing potential therapeutic interventions aimed at mitigating immune-mediated muscle damage.
