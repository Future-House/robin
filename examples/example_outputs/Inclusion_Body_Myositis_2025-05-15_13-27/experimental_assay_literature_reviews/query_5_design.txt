Query: Design of high-throughput, high-content imaging assays to quantify pathological protein aggregates (amyloid-β oligomers, phosphorylated tau, TDP-43 inclusions) and evaluate candidate autophagy or proteostasis modulators in differentiating myoblast cultures, including development of fluorescent reporter constructs, automated image segmentation and multiparametric analysis pipelines

The design of a robust high-throughput, high-content imaging assay for quantifying pathological protein aggregates in differentiating myoblast cultures involves several crucial components. First, establishing a biologically relevant cell model is paramount. Differentiating myoblast cultures can be engineered to mimic both healthy and diseased states by employing patient-derived cells, isogenic genetically modified lines, or by inducing known pathologic conditions via gene silencing or overexpression. These models should allow for clear visualization of protein aggregates such as amyloid‐β oligomers, phosphorylated tau, and TDP‐43 inclusions, which are markers of disrupted proteostasis relevant to several human diseases (batoumeni2024highcontentimaginganda pages 42-45).

A key step is the development of fluorescent reporter constructs that specifically label the aggregates of interest. These constructs might include fusion proteins with reporters like GFP or use immunostaining with fluorescently conjugated antibodies against amyloid-β, phosphorylated tau, or TDP-43. Designing these tools requires extensive validation to ensure that the fluorescent signal correlates with aggregate formation without perturbing cellular function. In some cases, reporter cell lines similar to those expressing GFP-LC3 for autophagy monitoring can be adapted for aggregate detection (forveille2021highthroughputscreening pages 3-6).

Automated image acquisition should be performed using high-content imaging systems configured to operate in a 96- or 384-well plate format to facilitate high-throughput screening. Instruments such as the IN Cell Analyzer or confocal platforms integrated with environmental control systems are beneficial. These systems require optimization of exposure times, fluorescence filter sets, and autofocus parameters to capture high-quality images while minimizing phototoxic effects (kepiro2018highcontentphenotypic pages 14-18).

Automation of liquid handling for seeding cells, compound treatment, and fixation ensures consistency across wells. Standardized protocols for cell culture and assay timing—such as controlled treatment periods and fixative protocols (paraformaldehyde-based for preserving aggregate structures)—are essential. Automated liquid handling systems integrated with robotic plate handlers can standardize these steps across large compound libraries, improving throughput and reproducibility (forveille2021highthroughputscreening pages 6-9, barnett2024mitochondrialcomplexiiiderived pages 32-35).

For image analysis, automated segmentation is critical. Tools like AggreCount—an ImageJ macro—demonstrate that unbiased, cell-by-cell quantification of aggregates can be achieved by automated segmentation and thresholding routines. AggreCount is capable of distinguishing subcellular localizations (cytosol, perinuclear, or nuclear) of aggregates through fluorescent nuclear and cytoplasmic markers and by applying watershed algorithms for cell segmentation (klickstein2020aggrecountanunbiaseda pages 2-3, klickstein2020aggrecountanunbiased pages 1-4). Complementary software platforms such as CellProfiler may also be utilized for standardized segmentation pipelines, enabling multiparametric quantitation such as aggregate size, number, intensity, and spatial distribution (lesire2020highthroughputimagebasedaggresome pages 1-2).

The subsequent multiparametric analysis pipeline should integrate automated feature extraction with statistical analysis. Custom scripts (often using open-source software like R or MATLAB) can normalize and quantify data across multiple wells, supporting downstream dose-response analyses for candidate autophagy or proteostasis modulators. This analysis must be capable of distinguishing not only aggregate load but also dynamic changes in autophagic flux, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of candidate modulators (mclendon2017anunbiasedhighthroughput pages 5-6, menduti2023recentadvancesin pages 12-14).

Combining fluorescent reporter development, automated image segmentation, and multiparametric data analysis creates an effective platform. Such a platform supports the high-content screening of thousands of conditions, enabling the identification of chemical or genetic modulators that relieve or exacerbate pathological aggregate formation. The incorporation of relevant controls—both positive (e.g., known proteostasis disruptors) and negative—ensures assay validity and reproducibility across experiments (klickstein2020aggrecountanunbiased pages 5-6, menduti2023recentadvancesin pages 15-17).

In summary, a state-of-the-art assay for screening candidate modulators in differentiating myoblasts integrates: (1) the development of sensitive fluorescent reporters and immunolabeling methods to detect aggregates, (2) standardized cell culture procedures in high-throughput formats, (3) automated imaging systems configured for high-content applications with optimized acquisition parameters, (4) unbiased image segmentation methods such as those implemented by AggreCount, and (5) a robust multiparametric analysis pipeline that can extract meaningful aggregate features while correlating them with modulator efficacy. This comprehensive design approach is supported by advances in high-content imaging, automated segmentation, and multiparametric data processing detailed in the literature (batoumeni2024highcontentimaginganda pages 42-45, forveille2021highthroughputscreening pages 3-6, kepiro2018highcontentphenotypic pages 14-18, klickstein2020aggrecountanunbiaseda pages 2-3, menduti2023recentadvancesin pages 14-15).
