Query: Identification and validation of scalable in vitro skeletal muscle models for IBM drug screening, encompassing primary human myoblast differentiation and fusion protocols, iPSC-derived myotube formation, application of cytokine or growth factor stimuli, and functional readouts for myofiber integrity, contractility and metabolic profiling

The development of scalable in vitro skeletal muscle models for IBM drug screening requires an integrative approach that spans cell sourcing, precise differentiation protocols, immune and growth factor conditioning, and rigorous functional validations.

Starting with cell sourcing, two main strategies are employed. Primary human myoblasts are isolated from muscle biopsies; however, they face challenges related to limited proliferation, senescence, and variability in fusion capacity. Optimized culture conditions (e.g., hypothermic conditions, pliable substrates, and small molecule interventions) help preserve myogenic characteristics and enhance fusion into multinucleated myotubes (zschuntzsch2022theevolutionof pages 3-5, zschuntzsch2022theevolutionof pages 7-8). Immortalization methodologies—such as co-expression of SV40 large T antigen and telomerase reverse transcriptase—can extend proliferative capacity but must be carefully balanced against potential compromises in differentiation potential and genetic stability (zschuntzsch2022theevolutionof pages 25-26).

A robust alternative is the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSC-derived myotube formation offers the advantage of scalability and the possibility of patient-specific modeling. Direct programming via doxycycline-inducible overexpression of transcription factors such as MYOD1, PAX3, or PAX7 converts iPSCs into myogenic progenitors with high efficiency (70–90% myogenic cells within days), whereas non-transgenic protocols mimic embryonic myogenesis by sequential exposure to morphogens such as CHIR99021, BMP, or Notch inhibitors (iberite2022skeletalmuscledifferentiation pages 1-2, sun2024challengesandconsiderations pages 2-4). While MYOD1 overexpression expedites myotube formation, it bypasses early-stage developmental cues, which may limit the regeneration potential associated with satellite-like cells; thus, incorporating PAX3/7 expression or directed differentiation protocols that capture early mesodermal markers can yield a more physiologically relevant progenitor pool (iberite2022skeletalmuscledifferentiation pages 12-13).

The application of cytokine and growth factor stimuli constitutes the next critical step in model validation. Exposure to cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ) and growth factors (e.g., IGF-1, dexamethasone) simulates the inflammatory and regenerative signaling observed in IBM muscle tissue. These factors not only enhance differentiation but also induce pathophysiological responses such as myofiber atrophy and contractile deficits, reflecting the in vivo disease milieu (zschuntzsch2022theevolutionof pages 16-17, zschuntzsch2022theevolutionof pages 5-7).

Functional validation of these models involves several complementary readouts. Morphological assessment through immunostaining for myogenic markers (myosin heavy chain, titin, desmin) confirms myofiber integrity (iberite2022skeletalmuscledifferentiation pages 11-12). Contractility assays employing electrical or chemical stimulation (e.g., acetylcholine) are used to measure force generation, calcium handling, and the maintenance of contraction strength, providing benchmarks against native muscle performance (zschuntzsch2022theevolutionof pages 10-10, zschuntzsch2022theevolutionof pages 2-3). In addition, metabolic profiling—including evaluations of mitochondrial function, ATP production, and calcium dynamics—is essential to establish the bioenergetic competence of these tissues and their relevance to IBM-associated metabolic defects (Clinical Trial Search: in vitro skeletal muscle model AND IBM AND differentiation OR fusion OR iPSC OR cytokine OR contractility OR metabolic, zschuntzsch2022theevolutionof pages 30-31).

In summary, the identification and validation of scalable in vitro skeletal muscle models for IBM drug screening require a multi-pronged approach. This includes utilizing primary human myoblasts and iPSC-derived cells through carefully optimized differentiation and fusion protocols; implementing controlled cytokine and growth factor regimens to recapitulate the IBM inflammatory microenvironment; and deploying comprehensive functional assays that assess myofiber integrity, contractility, and metabolic health. Leveraging these methodologies ensures that the in vitro models accurately mimic the in vivo pathology of IBM, thereby enhancing translational relevance for drug screening and therapeutic development (iberite2022skeletalmuscledifferentiation pages 1-2, zschuntzsch2022theevolutionof pages 3-5, sun2024challengesandconsiderations pages 2-4, NCT02980302).
