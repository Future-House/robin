Query: Comprehensive investigation of the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving inclusion body myositis pathology, focusing on β-amyloid precursor protein processing, phosphorylated tau accumulation, TDP-43 mislocalization, mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress pathways in human skeletal muscle cells under proinflammatory conditions

Inclusion body myositis (IBM), particularly its sporadic form (sIBM), is a complex degenerative muscle disease in which chronic inflammation intersects with multiple aberrant molecular pathways. At its core, IBM pathology is defined by dysregulated β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, abnormal tau phosphorylation, TDP-43 mislocalization, mitochondrial dysfunction, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, all occurring under proinflammatory conditions in skeletal muscle cells (gonzalezchapa2023theemergingrole pages 11-12, needham2017advancesininclusion pages 12-12).

APP processing in IBM is dysregulated by both intrinsic cellular defects and extrinsic proinflammatory signals. Elevated APP mRNA levels result in increased production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, particularly the cytotoxic Aβ42 species. The proteolytic cleavage of APP is mediated by β-secretases (BACE1 and BACE2) and the γ-secretase complex, all of which are upregulated in affected muscle fibers (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8). Proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β and interferon-gamma, further enhance APP expression and contribute to a self-perpetuating cycle of Aβ production and deposition, ultimately leading to impaired calcium handling and muscle cell toxicity (needham2017advancesininclusion pages 5-6).

Phosphorylated tau accumulation is another critical feature of IBM pathology. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein whose hyperphosphorylation—mediated by kinases such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β)—leads to its aggregation into paired helical filaments within muscle fibers (gonzalezchapa2023theemergingrole pages 11-12, guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 23-24). This abnormal tau phosphorylation not only disrupts microtubule stability but also exacerbates proteostatic failure, thereby reinforcing the degenerative process initiated by APP dysregulation. The aggregation of phosphorylated tau further impairs cellular functions, contributing directly to muscle fiber degeneration.

TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43) normally functions as a nuclear protein involved in RNA metabolism. In IBM, however, TDP-43 mislocalizes to the sarcoplasm where it aggregates into insoluble inclusions. This mislocalization disrupts normal RNA processing and splicing, thereby impairing the production of key regulatory proteins required for muscle homeostasis (gonzalezchapa2023theemergingrole pages 11-12, mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 261-264). TDP-43 aggregation is further amplified by proinflammatory mediators, which contribute to cellular stress and reinforce the cycle of degenerative signaling in muscle cells.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is another central mechanism underpinning IBM pathology. Muscle fibers in IBM exhibit structural and functional mitochondrial abnormalities, including increased numbers of cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-negative fibers, mitochondrial DNA mutations, and compromised oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial dysfunction is aggravated by the accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates, which disturb the tricarboxylic acid cycle and promote a shift toward anaerobic metabolism. This bioenergetic deficit results in enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and further damages mitochondrial structures, potentiating muscle weakness and degeneration (gonzalezchapa2023theemergingrole pages 11-12, mcleish2024exploringtheassociation pages 29-32).

Finally, ER stress pathways are profoundly activated in IBM under conditions of chronic inflammation. The accumulation of misfolded proteins due to defective proteostasis, including impaired ubiquitin–proteasome system activity and dysfunctional autophagy, triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). Key ER chaperones, such as GRP78 and GRP94, become upregulated in an attempt to restore protein folding homeostasis; however, persistent ER stress eventually shifts the cellular response from protective to pro-apoptotic. This maladaptive response is further compounded by proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress, ultimately promoting muscle fiber atrophy and degeneration (needham2017advancesininclusion pages 5-6, spicer2018investigatingtheeffects pages 20-26).

Taken together, the interplay among disrupted APP processing, tau hyperphosphorylation, TDP-43 mislocalization, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic ER stress forms a pathological cascade that is exacerbated by a proinflammatory environment. This multifaceted process underscores the challenging nature of IBM, where both degenerative and inflammatory mechanisms converge to drive progressive muscle wasting and functional decline (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 28-30).
