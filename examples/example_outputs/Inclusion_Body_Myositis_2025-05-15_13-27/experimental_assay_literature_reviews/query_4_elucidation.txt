Query: Elucidation of autophagy-lysosomal and ubiquitin-proteasome system dysfunction in IBM, detailing robust assays for monitoring LC3-II flux, p62/SQSTM1 accumulation, proteasome catalytic activity, mitochondrial clearance and apoptotic signaling in cultured human myotubes subjected to proteostatic stressors

The elucidation of autophagy‐lysosomal and ubiquitin‐proteasome system (UPS) dysfunction in inclusion body myositis (IBM) hinges on the deployment of multiple complementary assays in cultured human myotubes under proteostatic stress. A robust experimental strategy entails quantitative and qualitative assessments of autophagic flux, UPS proteolytic activity, mitochondrial turnover, and apoptotic signaling.

First, evaluating autophagic flux requires monitoring the conversion of LC3-I to its lipidated form LC3-II. LC3-II flux assays are typically conducted by immunoblotting for LC3 in cells treated with lysosomal inhibitors such as bafilomycin A1 or chloroquine. Such inhibitors block the degradation of LC3-II, thereby enabling the quantification of autophagosome formation relative to basal autophagic turnover. In this context, comparing LC3-II levels in the presence versus absence of inhibitors delineates the dynamic flux rather than static LC3-II levels, a critical consideration given that increased LC3-II can also result from blockade downstream in the pathway (spicer2018investigatingtheeffects pages 102-105, bhattarai2017functionalroleof pages 46-49).

In parallel, p62/SQSTM1 accumulation is a key readout for impaired autophagic degradation. p62 serves as a cargo receptor that is normally degraded within autolysosomes; thus, its accumulation is indicative of flux impairments. Quantification of p62 levels can be achieved through immunoblotting or immunofluorescence, with the latter allowing visualization of aggregated puncta in human myotubes. Such measurements often correlate with LC3-II flux data and help confirm autophagic dysfunction in IBM models (OpenTargets Search: inclusion body myositis-SQSTM1,LC3,proteasome,mitochondria, spicer2018investigatingtheeffects pages 37-41).

To assess UPS functionality, the measurement of proteasome catalytic activity is mandatory. Reliable assays exploit fluorogenic peptide substrates that are specific for the proteasome’s chymotrypsin-like (CT-L), trypsin-like, and caspase-like activities in cell lysates. Upon cleavage of these substrates, the released fluorophore can be quantified, providing a direct measure of catalytic activity. Coupling these assays with the use of selective proteasome inhibitors can further validate that the observed activity is proteasome-dependent. Such enzymatic assays are particularly robust and have been optimized in cultured myotubes subjected to proteasostatic stress (bhattarai2017functionalroleof pages 74-77, overa2019trim32butnot pages 16-19).

Mitochondrial clearance, or mitophagy, is another central component to evaluate in IBM due to the observed mitochondrial abnormalities. A multipronged approach is recommended: First, staining with mitochondrial-specific dyes (such as MitoTracker or membrane potential probes like JC-1) provides an estimate of mitochondrial mass and functional status. Second, immunoblotting or immunofluorescence for mitochondrial proteins such as TOM20, in combination with LC3, can establish whether impaired mitochondria co-localize with autophagosomes, serving as an indirect measure of mitophagy. Additionally, monitoring markers like phosphorylated S65-ubiquitin, which accumulates in response to mitophagic signaling, offers further insight into mitochondrial clearance defects under proteostatic stress (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 23-24, naddaf2025nlrp3inflammasomeactivation pages 1-2).

Finally, apoptotic signaling is evaluated using a suite of assays detecting both early and late events in programmed cell death. Caspase-3/7 activity assays are widely used to quantify the initiation of apoptosis; these fluorometric or luminescent assays offer sensitive detection of caspase activation in response to sustained proteostatic stress. Complementary methods include Annexin V staining, which detects externalization of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane—an early apoptotic marker—and the TUNEL assay for detecting DNA fragmentation at later stages of apoptosis. Western blot detection of cleaved PARP also serves as an important confirmatory marker of apoptotic activation (spicer2018investigatingtheeffects pages 37-41, drott2020ab1237diagnosticvalue pages 1-1).

Collectively, the integration of these approaches in human myotubes exposed to proteostatic stress ensures a comprehensive analysis of the intertwined dysfunctions of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway and UPS. By quantifying LC3-II flux and p62 accumulation, researchers can directly assess autophagic dynamics, whereas proteasome catalytic assays validate UPS impairment. Mitochondrial clearance assays, which combine mitochondrial dyes with immunostaining for autophagic markers, elucidate deficits in mitophagy, and apoptosis assays provide a readout for downstream consequences of these proteostatic failures. This multi-assay strategy not only recapitulates the molecular pathology observed in IBM but also offers translational insights into potential therapeutic targets for mitigating muscle degeneration (spicer2018investigatingtheeffects pages 102-105, OpenTargets Search: inclusion body myositis-SQSTM1,LC3,proteasome,mitochondria, bhattarai2017functionalroleof pages 97-100, guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8).
