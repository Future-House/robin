Proposal for Elamipretide (SS-31)

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of the potential of Elamipretide (SS-31) for repurposing in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), structured into several critical sections. This analysis reviews the candidate’s synthetic origins, therapeutic history, detailed molecular mechanism, the expected cellular and tissue effects in IBM, and an overall evaluation of its potential utility based solely on the available literature.

─────────────────────────────
Overview of Therapeutic Candidate

Elamipretide (SS-31) is a synthetic tetrapeptide belonging to the Szeto–Schiller (SS) family that was originally discovered through focused peptide–engineering approaches aimed at designing molecules capable of targeting mitochondria. Its structure, consisting of an alternating pattern of aromatic and cationic residues (specifically D-Arg, 2′,6′-dimethylTyr, Lys, and Phe–NH₂), confers a net positive charge and amphipathic characteristics that are essential for rapid cellular uptake and accumulation within the mitochondrial inner membrane (Ahmed et al., 2018). The chemical synthesis is undertaken with standard solid‐phase peptide synthesis methods, ensuring that the final product is of high purity and can be manufactured reproducibly for both preclinical and clinical studies (Stefaniak et al., 2024). SS-31 is classified as a mitochondrial‐targeted peptide therapeutic, a novel class that has been developed to restore mitochondrial bioenergetics by selectively binding to key mitochondrial lipids such as cardiolipin (Mitchell et al., 2019). Cardiolipin is exclusively located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is critical for maintaining the architecture of mitochondrial cristae, organizing the electron transport chain (ETC) into supercomplexes, and ensuring efficient ATP production (Mitchell et al., 2019). The unique design of Elamipretide allows it to rapidly accumulate within skeletal muscle cells in preclinical models, lending support to its potential use in muscle diseases like IBM where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a prominent role (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Overall, its synthetic origins, precise molecular design, and ability to target the mitochondrial inner membrane position Elamipretide as an attractive candidate for repurposing in disorders characterized by energy failure and oxidative stress.

Therapeutic History

Elamipretide has been evaluated across a broad range of preclinical and clinical contexts where mitochondrial dysfunction is a prominent feature. In preclinical animal studies, particularly using rodent and canine models, treatment with SS-31 improved various aspects of mitochondrial function, including enhancement of mitochondrial respiration, stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Ryan et al., 2016). These studies have demonstrated that chronic administration of Elamipretide can restore critical parameters of mitochondrial health in models of heart failure and ischemia–reperfusion injury, with improvements seen in skeletal and cardiac muscle function (Ryan et al., 2016). In addition to cardiac applications, preclinical evaluations have addressed skeletal muscle performance, where treatment reversed age-related mitochondrial declines and improved exercise endurance (Campbell et al., 2022). Safety and tolerability profiles in early-phase clinical trials have been encouraging; for example, clinical investigations in patients with primary mitochondrial myopathies established that Elamipretide is generally well tolerated and exhibits some beneficial effects on mitochondrial biomarkers—even though not all primary functional endpoints were met in the pivotal MMPOWER-3 study (Karaa et al., 2023). In addition, studies in canine models of heart failure demonstrated that SS-31 improved mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle, further supporting its application in muscle pathologies (Sabbah et al., 2019). Despite these extensive studies in diseases with mitochondrial impairment, no clinical trial to date has specifically addressed Inclusion Body Myositis, though the underlying mitochondrial deficits shared between mitochondrial myopathies and IBM strongly justify a repurposing approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

─────────────────────────────
Mechanism of Action

At the molecular level, the efficacy of Elamipretide stems from its well-characterized mechanism of selectively binding to cardiolipin within the mitochondrial inner membrane. Cardiolipin acts as a linchpin for maintaining mitochondrial structure—stabilizing the cristae architecture, anchoring cytochrome c, and organizing ETC complexes into supercomplexes—and its oxidation is known to result in impaired ATP synthesis and increased ROS production (Mitchell et al., 2019). The amphipathic nature of SS-31 enables it to engage in dual interactions with cardiolipin. Electrostatic interactions occur between its cationic residues (arginine and lysine) and the negatively charged phosphate groups on cardiolipin, while the hydrophobic interactions arise between its aromatic residues (2′,6′-dimethyltyrosine and phenylalanine) and the acyl chains of cardiolipin (Mitchell et al., 2019). This dual binding protects cardiolipin from oxidative modifications and helps maintain the integrity of mitochondrial cristae, preserving the functional assembly of ETC supercomplexes (Karaa et al., 2023).

Beyond simply protecting cardiolipin, Elamipretide exerts significant effects on mitochondrial surface electrostatics. Biophysical studies utilizing fluorescence titration and calorimetry have shown that SS-31 reduces the negative surface potential of the mitochondrial inner membrane (Mitchell et al., 2019). This modulation of membrane charge is critical for ensuring optimal ion interactions, particularly with ADP and calcium. For instance, improved ADP sensitivity of the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) has been observed following SS-31 treatment, which facilitates more efficient ADP import and, consequently, enhanced ATP synthesis (Pharaoh et al., 2023). Studies using molecular dynamics simulations have detailed the dynamic orientation of SS-31 as it interacts with lipid bilayers, confirming that its insertion into the membrane preserves optimal lipid packing and prevents deleterious changes in membrane fluidity (Mitchell et al., 2019). Overall, these molecular interactions stabilize mitochondrial function by reducing electron leak, minimizing ROS generation, and maintaining robust ATP production—a combination of effects particularly relevant in tissues suffering from energy deficits as seen in IBM (Mitchell et al., 2019).

Additional investigations have revealed that SS-31’s beneficial actions include protecting against pathological calcium influx events by modulating the overall ionic environment at the membrane interface (Mitchell et al., 2019). This property is especially important because calcium overload is known to trigger mitochondrial permeability transition and subsequent apoptotic cascades. By preserving membrane structure and moderating ion interactions, Elamipretide enhances mitochondrial resilience under stress conditions (Mitchell et al., 2019). Furthermore, structural studies have supported that SS-31 integrates into the mitochondrial inner membrane in a manner that does not disrupt the lamellar structure but rather supports the organization and stability of critical respiratory complexes, reinforcing its potential for disease modification in myopathies (Mitchell et al., 2019).

Expected Effect in Inclusion Body Myositis

Inclusion Body Myositis is characterized by progressive muscle weakness, fiber atrophy, and features of both inflammatory and degenerative pathology, with mitochondrial dysfunction being a notable component. Histopathologic and biochemical analyses of IBM muscle have demonstrated diminished ATP production, abnormal mitochondrial networks, and increased oxidative damage. Given these abnormalities, the central hypothesis is that Elamipretide’s mitochondrial-targeted actions will translate into clinically relevant benefits in IBM by addressing both bioenergetic deficits and oxidative stress.

Upon systemic administration—whether subcutaneously or intravenously—Elamipretide is expected to be rapidly taken up by muscle tissue. Once internalized, it localizes predominantly to the mitochondria of skeletal muscle cells where it binds to cardiolipin. This binding is proposed to restore the structural integrity of the mitochondrial inner membrane and the organization of ETC supercomplexes, which are often fragmented in IBM myotubes (Campbell et al., 2022). Consequently, improved assembly and stability of these supercomplexes will enhance electron flux through the ETC, thus reducing electron leak and resultant ROS production. Lowered ROS levels would, in turn, diminish further oxidative damage to mitochondrial and cellular proteins, lipids, and DNA, thereby interrupting vicious cycles of mitochondrial dysfunction (Karaa et al., 2023).

Another expected benefit involves the improved functioning of the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that Elamipretide enhances ANT’s sensitivity to ADP, resulting in more efficient ADP uptake and elevated ATP production in aged and dystrophic muscle tissue (Pharaoh et al., 2023). In the context of IBM, where ATP deficits contribute to impaired contractile force, this restoration of bioenergetic function is predicted to translate into improved muscle strength and endurance. Moreover, enhanced ATP synthesis coupled with reduced ROS production may also favor the preservation and repair of muscle fibers, ultimately leading to a measurable improvement in contractile performance in both in vitro IBM myotube assays and future in vivo models.

Given IBM’s multifactorial nature, where inflammatory pathways and protein misfolding events also contribute to pathology, Elamipretide’s precise mitochondrial action might be most effective if used as part of a combination therapy. However, its ability to selectively and effectively restore mitochondrial membrane potential, supercomplex integrity, and ADP uptake provides a strong mechanistic rationale for its evaluation as a monotherapy in early proof-of-concept studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Ultimately, the expected cascade of effects—from improved mitochondrial membrane stabilization to enhanced ATP production—should result in measurable gains in muscle contractility and reduced fatigue. Such an effect would be captured in experiments showing increases in mitochondrial membrane potential, stabilization of ETC complexes, improved ADP sensitivity, and enhanced in vitro contractile force in IBM-relevant models (Campbell et al., 2022; Pharaoh et al., 2023).

─────────────────────────────
Overall Evaluation

A thorough evaluation of Elamipretide as a candidate therapeutic for Inclusion Body Myositis reveals several notable strengths as well as some challenges that must be addressed. One of the primary strengths is its well-established synthetic origin and design. As a chemically synthesized tetrapeptide from the Szeto–Schiller family, its structure has been optimized for rapid cellular uptake and specific mitochondrial targeting via binding to cardiolipin (Ahmed et al., 2018; Stefaniak et al., 2024). This design has been repeatedly validated across multiple preclinical studies, lending strong support to its fundamental mechanism of action.

In terms of therapeutic history, Elamipretide has a track record of beneficial effects in several contexts of mitochondrial dysfunction. Evidence from rodent and canine models clearly demonstrates improved mitochondrial respiration, enhanced ADP uptake via the ANT, and reductions in ROS production following treatment (Ryan et al., 2016; Sabbah et al., 2019). Early-phase clinical data, particularly from trials in primary mitochondrial myopathy, confirm a favorable safety profile while indicating potential improvements in mitochondrial bioenergetics (Karaa et al., 2023). Although these trials did not always meet all primary endpoints, they nonetheless provide invaluable proof of concept in conditions characterized by impaired oxidative phosphorylation—a feature that is also central to IBM pathology.

The molecular mechanism of Elamipretide is another critical strength. Detailed biophysical studies have elucidated that its dual mode of binding—through both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions—to cardiolipin underpins its ability to restore mitochondrial structure (Mitchell et al., 2019). This interaction not only preserves the structural integrity of the mitochondrial inner membrane but also stabilizes ETC supercomplexes, thereby reducing electron leak and curbing ROS production (Mitchell et al., 2019). Furthermore, its capacity to modulate mitochondrial surface electrostatics enhances ADP sensitivity and ATP synthesis, which is essential for improving muscle contractility (Pharaoh et al., 2023).

From the perspective of the expected effect in IBM, the hypothesis that Elamipretide will bind to cardiolipin in IBM myotubes to restore mitochondrial supercomplex stability, reduce ROS production, and subsequently improve ATP-dependent contractile force is grounded in sound mechanistic data. Studies have shown that mitochondria in IBM and other myopathies are characterized by disorganized cristae and impaired energy production; hence, repairing these defects could directly contribute to improved muscle function (Campbell et al., 2022; Pharaoh et al., 2023). Its favorable preclinical muscle uptake, evidenced in rodent studies, further supports its use in disorders with localized muscle dysfunction (Campbell et al., 2023).

There are, however, several challenges and potential weaknesses. One key issue is the lack of direct clinical evidence in IBM specifically. While the robust evidence in primary mitochondrial myopathy and related conditions is promising, IBM is a complex disease with inflammatory and degenerative components apart from mitochondrial dysfunction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Optimizing the dosing regimen for IBM might require tailored pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies because muscle involvement in IBM might be heterogeneous compared to other mitochondrial diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Moreover, the MMPOWER-3 trial in primary mitochondrial myopathy indicated that while safety is reliably maintained, the clinical efficacy endpoints remain modest, raising the question of whether monotherapy with Elamipretide will fully address the multifactorial pathology observed in IBM (Karaa et al., 2023).

Another consideration is that IBM is characterized by the presence of protein aggregates and immune-mediated damage in addition to mitochondrial deficits. Elamipretide’s mechanism is focused exclusively on mitochondrial membrane stabilization and does not directly address protein aggregation or immune modulation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This suggests that while Elamipretide could potentially improve mitochondrial function and enhance muscle strength, it may need to be combined with other agents that target the broader spectrum of IBM pathophysiology for a more comprehensive therapeutic effect.

Despite these issues, the overall advantages of Elamipretide are compelling. Its reproducible chemical synthesis, well-documented mechanism of action, and an established safety profile provide an excellent platform for further investigation in IBM. Additional preclinical studies using IBM-specific in vitro models (e.g., primary IBM myotubes) or animal models that recapitulate the mitochondrial defects seen in IBM will be crucial. These studies should focus on quantifying improvements in mitochondrial supercomplex stability, membrane potential, ADP sensitivity, ROS production, and ultimately, improvements in contractile force (Mitchell et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Furthermore, sensitive biomarkers—such as mitochondrial membrane potential, levels of specific ETC components within supercomplexes, and quantifications of intracellular ROS—can serve as early readouts to guide dose optimization and efficacy evaluations. Such biomarkers could be integrated into both preclinical and early-phase clinical trials to better understand how mitochondrial target engagement correlates with functional improvements in muscle strength and endurance (Karaa et al., 2024).

In summary, Elamipretide presents a scientifically robust, innovative approach to addressing mitochondrial dysfunction—a known mediator of muscle weakness in IBM. Its proven ability to restore mitochondrial bioenergetics in multiple preclinical models, coupled with clinical data supporting its safety, makes it a strong candidate for repurposing in IBM despite the absence of direct clinical data in this indication. The next logical steps would involve:
• Establishing IBM-relevant preclinical models to evaluate Elamipretide’s ability to restore mitochondrial supercomplex integrity and function.
• Conducting detailed biomarker-driven studies to assess changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, ADP uptake, ROS production, and overall ATP production.
• Designing early-phase clinical trials with specific endpoints related to muscle strength, endurance, and mitochondrial function in IBM patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

─────────────────────────────
Overall Conclusion

Based on the integrated biomedical, biochemical, and clinical literature, Elamipretide (SS-31) emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in Inclusion Body Myositis. Its synthetic origin and chemical manufacture, bolstered by robust biophysical evidence of selective cardiolipin binding and mitochondrial stabilization, provide a sound scientific basis for its potential therapeutic benefits in IBM (Ahmed et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2019). The preclinical and clinical histories in related mitochondrial pathologies, particularly primary mitochondrial myopathies and heart failure, establish that Elamipretide can improve mitochondrial function, reduce ROS production, and increase ATP synthesis (Ryan et al., 2016; Sabbah et al., 2019).

Its specific mechanisms of action—stabilizing mitochondrial membranes through binding to cardiolipin, enhancing the organization of ETC supercomplexes, reducing oxidative stress, and improving ADP sensitivity—are directly relevant to the mitochondrial defects observed in IBM muscle (Mitchell et al., 2019; Pharaoh et al., 2023). While the absence of direct clinical trials in IBM and the multifactorial nature of the disease are valid concerns, the compelling evidence supporting mitochondrial dysfunction as a driver of muscle weakness in IBM provides a strong rationale for targeting this pathway. The favorable pharmacokinetic properties, as demonstrated in rodent muscle uptake and sustained improvements in mitochondrial indices, further strengthen the argument for advancing Elamipretide into IBM-specific studies (Campbell et al., 2023).

Nonetheless, it is important to remain cautious regarding the translation of mitochondrial improvements to functional clinical benefits in a complex disease like IBM. Early-phase trials in IBM should be structured to closely monitor mitochondrial biomarkers and correlate these with improvements in muscle performance and fatigue scores. Given the heterogeneity and additional pathological components in IBM (such as inflammatory and degenerative mechanisms), Elamipretide might ultimately be most beneficial when used in conjunction with agents that address these other aspects of the disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In conclusion, Elamipretide’s strong mechanistic rationale, established preclinical efficacy in conditions characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, and its extensive evaluation in related diseases position it as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in Inclusion Body Myositis. Further research is warranted to validate target engagement in IBM-specific models and to determine optimal dosing for affected muscle groups. If these preclinical studies are successful, early-phase clinical trials incorporating comprehensive biomarker analyses and functional performance endpoints will be essential to determine whether Elamipretide can achieve meaningful improvement in muscle strength and endurance in IBM patients (Karaa et al., 2024). Overall, while challenges remain, the promising data support continued investment in Elamipretide as an innovative, mitochondria-targeted therapeutic with the potential to address a significant unmet need in Inclusion Body Myositis.

Final Remarks

Elamipretide (SS-31) offers a unique intervention strategy that directly addresses mitochondrial dysfunction—an important pathophysiological feature of Inclusion Body Myositis. The compound’s robust synthetic origins and precise molecular design, evident from its selective binding to cardiolipin and stabilization of mitochondrial membranes, lay a solid foundation for its repurposing potential (Ahmed et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2019). Its extensive therapeutic history in models of heart failure, primary mitochondrial myopathies, and aging-related muscle decline, along with a favorable safety profile in multiple clinical trials, further bolster its promise (Karaa et al., 2023; Ryan et al., 2016).

While IBM presents additional complexities due to inflammatory and degenerative components, the mitochondrial pathology observed in IBM provides a rational basis for pursuing therapies that restore mitochondrial function. Elamipretide’s demonstrated ability to enhance ATP production, improve ADP sensitivity via effects on the adenine nucleotide translocator, and reduce mitochondrial ROS is particularly relevant to improving muscle contractility in IBM (Pharaoh et al., 2023; Mitchell et al., 2019).

Looking ahead, further detailed studies using IBM-specific preclinical models are essential to define the extent to which mitochondrial supercomplex stabilization by Elamipretide translates into functional improvements in muscle tissue. In parallel, biomarker development and dose optimization studies will be critical to informing clinical trial design in IBM populations. Although challenges related to disease heterogeneity and the possibility of only modest improvements as monotherapy exist, the combination of favorable mechanistic action and reproducible clinical safety forms a compelling case for its continued evaluation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

In summary, based on the current integrated literature, Elamipretide stands out as an innovative and scientifically rational candidate for further investigation in Inclusion Body Myositis. With strategic preclinical experiments and carefully designed early-phase clinical studies, this mitochondrial‐targeted peptide has the potential to become a valuable disease‐modifying therapy for IBM, a condition that currently lacks effective therapeutic options (El-Hattab et al., 2017). The collective evidence strongly supports further investment in Elamipretide research as part of a broader effort to improve muscle bioenergetics and function in patients suffering from this challenging disease.

By leveraging the precise molecular interactions of Elamipretide with mitochondrial membranes and its established effect on electron transport chain stabilization and ROS reduction, there is a robust rationale to test whether these benefits can be translated to improved muscle contractility and reduced fatigue in IBM. A focused translational research program is warranted to bridge the gap between the promising preclinical data and clinical efficacy, ultimately aiming to offer a novel, mitochondria-targeted therapeutic avenue for patients with Inclusion Body Myositis (Karaa et al., 2024; Mitchell et al., 2019).

In closing, while challenges remain in addressing the complete spectrum of IBM pathology, Elamipretide’s mechanism of restoring mitochondrial function through cardiolipin stabilization presents a unique and promising treatment strategy. The ongoing research in mitochondrial-targeted therapeutics provides a solid foundation for moving this candidate forward into rigorously designed IBM-specific studies, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes for patients with this debilitating disorder (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Pharaoh et al., 2023).

Final Summary

Elamipretide (SS-31) is a synthetic mitochondrial‐targeted peptide discovered and developed using advanced peptide engineering techniques, characterized by its specific binding to cardiolipin in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Its therapeutic history spans successful preclinical models addressing conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction and multiple early-phase clinical trials in primary mitochondrial disorders that confirm its safety profile and potential to improve bioenergetic parameters. Mechanistically, Elamipretide acts by stabilizing the mitochondrial inner membrane, preserving ETC supercomplex assembly, and reducing oxidative stress while enhancing ADP uptake—all critical functions compromised in Inclusion Body Myositis. Although direct clinical evidence in IBM remains to be generated, the substantial overlap in mitochondrial pathology between IBM and other mitochondrial myopathies supports the rationale for its repurposing. With further preclinical validation focused on IBM-specific models and optimization of dosing regimens in affected muscle tissue, Elamipretide has the potential to significantly improve muscle contractility and patient outcomes in IBM. Given the urgent unmet need in this field, further investment in the translational development of Elamipretide is both scientifically justified and clinically promising (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Karaa et al., 2024).

Overall, while combination therapies may ultimately be needed to address the full spectrum of IBM pathology, the singular mitochondrial targeting offered by Elamipretide represents a novel and high-potential therapeutic strategy worthy of further rigorous investigation.
