Proposal for Celastrol

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Celastrol is a natural quinone methide triterpenoid originally isolated from the Thunder God Vine (Tripterygium wilfordii), a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine for its anti‐inflammatory properties. This compound belongs to the class of triterpenoids, which have been extensively investigated for their broad spectrum of biological activities including anti‐inflammatory, anti‐oxidant, and cytoprotective effects. Celastrol was discovered using traditional extraction methods from medicinal plants and further characterized for its potent pharmacological properties. Its chemical structure, defined by a quinone methide moiety, is critical for its reactivity toward nucleophilic sites on proteins, thereby enabling it to modulate stress-responsive pathways. This compound has been mainly synthesized in its natural form for biochemical assays, and structural analogues have been developed to probe its mechanism of action and optimize its pharmacodynamic properties (Westerheide et al., 2004; Trott et al., 2008).

Therapeutic History:
Celastrol has a rich history in preclinical research for its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. In traditional settings, extracts of Tripterygium wilfordii have been used to treat inflammatory conditions, and celastrol is now recognized as one of its key active components. Preclinically, celastrol has been evaluated in a variety of disease models including autoimmune disorders, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, and several cancer models due to its ability to inhibit key inflammatory pathways like NF-κB as well as its capacity to induce a heat shock response (Westerheide et al., 2004; Vilaboa & Voellmy, 2023). However, searches of clinical trial databases have failed to reveal any registered studies evaluating celastrol in the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) or related muscle diseases, indicating that while its use in inflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions has been explored, there is no direct clinical precedent for its application in IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In muscular dystrophy contexts and models of inflammatory muscle disease, such as dysferlinopathies, celastrol has been investigated primarily for its anti-inflammatory effects through NF-κB inhibition, though improvements in muscle function were not consistently observed (Dillingham et al., 2015; Ichim-Moreno et al., 2010). These studies suggest that celastrol’s beneficial effects on muscle may require modulation beyond inflammation alone, with a strong emphasis now on its ability to induce a heat shock response that could facilitate proteostasis in diseased muscle tissue.

Mechanism of Action:
Celastrol’s mechanism of action is multifaceted, reflecting its activity at several molecular targets. A central aspect of its activity is the robust activation of the heat shock response (HSR) mediated by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). Celastrol achieves this by covalently modifying cysteine residues on target proteins, which initiates HSF1 hyperphosphorylation and nuclear accumulation leading to the increased transcription of heat shock proteins (HSPs) such as HSP70 and HSP27. The resulting upregulation of these chaperones is critical for enhancing the cellular capacity for protein folding and facilitating the clearance of misfolded or aggregated proteins—a process particularly relevant to proteinopathies such as IBM, where TDP-43 aggregation is a hallmark (Trott et al., 2008; Westerheide et al., 2004). At the molecular level, celastrol also exhibits inhibitory activity on HSP90, which is known to form a complex with HSF1 under non-stressed conditions. By disrupting this complex, celastrol effectively unleashes HSF1 to drive the HSR. In addition to these effects, celastrol modulates inflammatory pathways; it inhibits NF-κB signaling by interfering with IκB kinase activation and the subsequent phosphorylation of IκBα, thereby reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This anti-inflammatory action compliments its induction of cytoprotective HSPs and contributes to its overall therapeutic profile (Klaic et al., 2012; Westerheide et al., 2004). In muscle cells, the activation of HSP70 specifically has been associated with protection against atrophy and improved myofiber integrity, as evidenced by studies showing that HSP70 overexpression can rescue myotube diameter and prevent protein degradation pathways such as those mediated by FoxO3 (Park & Park, 2015). Thus, celastrol’s ability to upregulate crucial molecular chaperones provides a direct mechanistic rationale for its proposed use in IBM, aiming to clear TDP-43 aggregates and restore sarcomere structure and contractile function.

Expected Effect:
Based on its well-documented mechanism of action, celastrol is expected to upregulate the HSF1-dependent heat shock response in IBM myotubes, leading to increased levels of HSP70 and HSP27. This upregulation is anticipated to enhance the cellular machinery responsible for maintaining protein homeostasis by facilitating the refolding or degradation of misfolded proteins. In the context of IBM, where TDP-43 aggregation disrupts normal muscle fiber architecture and impairs contractile function, an increase in HSP70 could promote the clearance of these toxic aggregates, thereby restoring sarcomere integrity and improving muscle function (Westerheide et al., 2004; Schiavone et al., 2021). Additionally, by inhibiting NF-κB signaling, celastrol may reduce chronic muscle inflammation—a critical factor that exacerbates muscle degeneration in IBM—and this dual action could synergistically support muscle repair and regeneration. In vitro studies in muscle cells have shown that restoration of HSP activity can counteract atrophic processes by modulating signaling pathways including FoxO3, which is known to drive the expression of muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases involved in protein degradation (Park & Park, 2015; Brinkmeier & Ohlendieck, 2014). Consequently, in an assay using IBM myotubes, celastrol is expected not only to diminish the burden of misfolded TDP-43 but also to improve myotube fusion, enhance contractile function, and restore overall muscle architecture by promoting a favorable proteostatic environment.

Overall Evaluation:
Celastrol represents a promising repurposed drug candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on its multifaceted pharmacological profile. Its natural origin and extensive preclinical history underscore its potential as an HSR inducer with robust anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. One of the major strengths of celastrol lies in its ability to activate HSF1 and thereby upregulate HSP70 and HSP27, which are critical for maintaining proteostasis and may facilitate the clearance of pathogenic protein aggregates such as TDP-43. The biochemical evidence supporting its mechanism indicates that celastrol can concurrently modulate proteostasis and inflammatory pathways, which is highly relevant given the dual pathology observed in IBM—namely, protein aggregation and muscle inflammation (Westerheide et al., 2004; Trott et al., 2008; Schiavone et al., 2021). Furthermore, preclinical studies in other muscle disease and neurodegenerative models have highlighted its potential benefits in reducing protein aggregation and improving muscle function, as well as its activity in modulating NF-κB signaling, which is particularly beneficial in inflammatory conditions (Vilaboa & Voellmy, 2023; Dillingham et al., 2015).

Nonetheless, several challenges and limitations must also be considered. Despite its promising mechanism, the therapeutic history of celastrol in muscle disease models has been mixed; while it shows potent anti-inflammatory effects and HSR induction in vitro, some in vivo studies, particularly those involving dysferlin-deficient mice, have failed to demonstrate improvements in muscle function despite reductions in inflammatory markers (Dillingham et al., 2015). This suggests that its benefits may be context-dependent, and successful translation to IBM will require careful optimization of dosing, formulation, and delivery—especially given celastrol’s narrow therapeutic window and potential toxicities at higher doses. Additionally, current clinical trial databases have not documented any trials specifically targeting IBM with celastrol, underscoring the need for more rigorous preclinical investigations to thoroughly evaluate its efficacy and safety in this particular context (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Another consideration is the pharmacokinetic profile of celastrol. Although preclinical studies suggest it is orally bioavailable in nanoformulations and is well tolerated in rodent models at sub-micromolar concentrations, detailed information regarding its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) in humans remains limited (Chan et al., 2021). This necessitates further pharmacological and toxicological studies to validate its suitability for chronic treatment in IBM patients, who may require long-term therapy. Moreover, while the induction of heat shock proteins is a compelling therapeutic strategy, it remains to be established whether the level of upregulation achieved by celastrol will be sufficient to overcome the proteostatic challenges characteristic of IBM muscle tissue, including the clearance of TDP-43 aggregates and restoration of sarcomere organization.

In summary, celastrol offers a mechanistically sound approach for addressing two major pathological features of IBM—protein aggregation and inflammation—through its dual action as an HSF1 inducer and NF-κB inhibitor. Its natural origin, historical use in traditional medicine, and demonstrated activity in preclinical models lend credibility to its potential repurposing for IBM. However, the translation of these findings into a clinically effective therapy for IBM will require further validation through comprehensive in vivo studies, optimized formulation strategies to enhance bioavailability and reduce off-target toxicities, and eventual clinical trials to ascertain its therapeutic efficacy and safety in patients. The strengths of celastrol include its robust activation of cytoprotective pathways and its ability to modulate multiple disease-relevant signaling cascades, while its weaknesses lie in the current gap in in vivo evidence for muscle function improvement and the need for better pharmacokinetic and toxicological data (Westerheide et al., 2004; Park & Park, 2015; Dillingham et al., 2015). Overall, while celastrol represents a promising candidate for drug repurposing in IBM based on its molecular mechanisms and preclinical potential, further targeted research is essential to address these challenges before it can be advanced as a therapeutic for Inclusion Body Myositis.
