Proposal for 20-Hydroxyecdysone (BIO101)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
20-Hydroxyecdysone (20E), marketed pharmaceutical-grade as BIO101, is a naturally derived ecdysteroid extracted predominantly from the edible plant Stemmacantha carthamoides (BIO101, 2016). Ecdysteroids, a class of steroid-like compounds originally discovered in insects as molting hormones, are also widely found in plants where they are known as phytoecdysteroids. These compounds have garnered considerable attention because they confer anabolic benefits in mammals without engaging classical steroid receptors, thereby avoiding the androgenic side effects typically associated with anabolic-androgenic steroids. BIO101 falls within this class and has been purified to a high degree (≥97% purity by HPLC), making it a novel candidate for clinical development. Its natural origin and oral formulation suggest ease of manufacturing and patient compliance, while its plant-derived nature signifies a distinct pharmacological profile compared to both conventional and emerging anabolic agents. Historically, ecdysteroids have been investigated as dietary supplements by athletes seeking to enhance muscle mass and performance; however, BIO101 is now being evaluated as a pharmaceutical agent targeting muscle wasting conditions (BIO101, 2016; Marquez-Miranda, 2016).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of 20-hydroxyecdysone is rooted in its long-standing use as a natural supplement with claimed anabolic effects. Over recent years, extensive preclinical studies have demonstrated that 20E stimulates protein synthesis, increases muscle fiber size, and enhances myotube differentiation in cell-based assays using C2C12 myoblasts—findings that have been corroborated in rodent models (Hirunsai, Yimlamai, & Suksamrarn, 2016; Tóth, Hunyadi, & Márki, 2008). More recently, BIO101 has advanced into early clinical trials that assess its safety and pharmacokinetics in both young and older adults, particularly within the context of sarcopenia, an age-related condition marked by loss of muscle mass and strength (Dioh et al., 2023; Marquez-Miranda, 2016). In Phase 1 trials, BIO101 was well tolerated up to doses of 450 mg twice daily, with pharmacodynamic markers hinting at muscle-protective effects through reductions in biomarkers such as creatine kinase and myoglobin (Dioh et al., 2023). Although BIO101 has been primarily explored for sarcopenia and muscle atrophy, its underlying anabolic mechanisms are shared with muscle degenerative disorders like Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). No clinical trial to date has directly targeted IBM with BIO101, but the promising results and safety record observed in elderly populations provide a strong rationale for its repurposing in IBM, where there is a tremendous unmet need for effective anabolic interventions (Dioh et al., 2023; Marquez-Miranda, 2016; Shanely, Merritt, & McBride, 2014).

Mechanism of Action:
The principal mechanism of BIO101 is its ability to stimulate anabolic pathways in muscle cells without engaging classical androgen receptors. At the molecular level, 20E is known to activate the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade—which in turn influences the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes—specifically enhancing the activity of mTORC2. Activation of this signaling pathway increases protein synthesis, promotes cell survival, and supports muscle hypertrophy. Unlike conventional anabolic agents that often rely on androgen receptor activation and may trigger broader systemic endocrine effects, BIO101’s activation of PI3K/Akt/mTORC2 appears highly specific and does not elicit androgenic side effects. In vitro studies on C2C12 myoblasts have shown that treatment with BIO101 enhances the expression of key myogenic regulatory factors (such as MyoD and myogenin) and increases the fusion index and myotube diameter, thereby suggesting enhanced capacity for muscle differentiation and regeneration (Serova et al., 2024). Furthermore, BIO101 has been shown to engage the Mas receptor—a component of the protective branch of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system—which further contributes to its muscle anabolic properties. The MAS receptor activation appears to lead to downstream signaling that enhances Akt phosphorylation and reduces the expression of myostatin, a potent inhibitor of muscle growth. This Mas receptor-mediated pathway is distinct from mechanisms used by anabolic-androgenic steroids or myostatin inhibitors, providing a novel therapeutic angle that is expected to induce muscle protein synthesis and counteract muscle atrophy in a more targeted fashion (Dioh et al., 2023; Serova et al., 2024; Shanely et al., 2014). In addition, several studies have pointed to the involvement of other anabolic pathways, including the modulation of AMPK and FOXO transcription factors, which together contribute to a balanced anabolic and anti-catabolic effect. The selective signaling through mTORC2 is particularly noteworthy because it supports muscle cell hypertrophy and regeneration without activating pathways that could lead to insulin resistance or other metabolic complications commonly seen with mTORC1 activation (Serova et al., 2024; Dioh et al., 2023; Zádor, 2025).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, BIO101 is expected to stimulate PI3K/Akt signaling in IBM myotubes, thereby promoting robust protein synthesis, mitigating atrophic processes, and ultimately increasing contractile amplitude in dysfunctional muscle fibers. In assays proposing to use IBM-derived myotubes, the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC2 pathway should result in an upregulation of anabolic proteins, enhanced myotube fusion, and increased muscle fiber diameter. This anabolic stimulus is anticipated to occur without the side effects associated with androgen receptor engagement, making it particularly attractive for long-term use in a chronic progressive condition such as IBM. The preliminary evidence from Phase 1 trials in sarcopenic cohorts, wherein dosing with BIO101 resulted in favorable safety profiles and improvements in muscle-related biomarkers, supports the notion that similar anabolic benefits may be realized in IBM muscle. It is expected that treatment with BIO101 will restore the expression levels of key proteins involved in muscle contractility and regeneration (such as MyoD, myogenin, and myosin heavy chain) and that these changes will translate into functional outcomes – for example, enhanced contractile force and endurance in muscle performance assays. Given that IBM pathology involves a combination of degenerative and inflammatory components, the anabolic effect of BIO101 might also indirectly counteract inflammatory signaling and improve muscle metabolism through the stabilization of muscle structural proteins. Moreover, the specificity for the Akt/mTORC2 axis suggests that the treatment will modulate protein synthesis in a manner that is tightly controlled, reducing the risk of adverse effects related to global mTOR activation. Coupled with its oral bioavailability and plant-derived origin, BIO101 represents a feasible therapeutic candidate to test in IBM, with expected outcomes including increased muscle mass, improved fiber integrity, and enhanced contractile function (Serova et al., 2024; Dioh et al., 2023; Shanely et al., 2014).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone) presents as a promising and innovative therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis. One of the main strengths of BIO101 is its novel mechanism of action. It selectively activates the PI3K/Akt/mTORC2 pathway through a Mas receptor-mediated process, which is distinct from the mechanisms employed by traditional anabolic agents. This specificity provides a therapeutic advantage by promoting muscle hypertrophy and regeneration without the undesirable androgenic side effects typically associated with conventional anabolic steroids (Dioh et al., 2023; Serova et al., 2024). Additionally, the existing clinical data in sarcopenia, where BIO101 has demonstrated a favorable safety profile and preliminary anabolic effects, bolsters confidence in its potential repurposing for IBM—a disease characterized by progressive muscle atrophy and impaired regeneration (Marquez-Miranda, 2016; Dioh et al., 2023).

Clinically, the fact that BIO101 is orally administered and derived from a natural plant source enhances its potential for long-term use and patient compliance. Its non-androgenic nature and selective anabolic stimulation represent a significant advantage, particularly for elderly patients who may be sensitive to hormonal side effects. Furthermore, preclinical rodent studies have shown increased muscle fiber size, improved myoblast differentiation, and enhanced muscle function following BIO101 treatment, providing a strong biochemical rationale for its application in muscle wasting conditions like IBM (Serova et al., 2024; Tóth et al., 2008).

However, there are some limitations and uncertainties that warrant careful consideration. First, while extensive data exist for the use of BIO101 in sarcopenia and muscle atrophy models, direct evidence for its efficacy in IBM specifically is still lacking. IBM is a complex inflammatory myopathy with both degenerative and inflammatory features, and the translation of anabolic benefits observed in sarcopenia to IBM remains a hypothesis that needs rigorous evaluation in dedicated clinical studies (Dioh et al., 2023; Marquez-Miranda, 2016). Second, the pharmacokinetics of 20E indicate a relatively short half-life, and while steady-state conditions have been achieved in clinical studies, ensuring sustained anabolic signaling in the context of chronic muscle degeneration may present challenges. Moreover, the heterogeneity of IBM pathology—in which autoinflammatory components and altered proteostasis coexist—could affect the responsiveness of muscle tissues to anabolic stimulation. It will therefore be critical to define appropriate dosing regimens and to select robust biomarkers for monitoring muscle regeneration and functional improvement in potential future trials (Dioh et al., 2023; Shanely et al., 2014).

Another potential challenge is that many anabolic interventions in muscle wasting diseases have struggled with translating preclinical success into significant clinical benefits. While BIO101’s unique mechanism of activating the protective arm of the renin-angiotensin system via Mas receptor and selective Akt/mTORC2 signaling is compelling, careful preclinical studies in relevant IBM models are needed to validate that these effects translate into clinically meaningful improvements in muscle contractility and strength. In this context, it would be advantageous to design experiments that comprehensively assess changes in muscle histology, contractile performance, and quality of life indicators in patients with IBM (Serova et al., 2024; Dioh et al., 2023).

In summary, BIO101 offers a promising novel approach for treating Inclusion Body Myositis by leveraging its unique anabolic properties, plant-derived origins, and distinctive mechanism of action that focuses on the Akt/mTORC2 pathway via Mas receptor activation. Its strengths include a robust safety profile as evidenced in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials in sarcopenia, lack of androgenic side effects, oral bioavailability, and compelling preclinical data on muscle fiber hypertrophy. However, the candidate’s efficacy in IBM remains to be directly studied, and further preclinical and clinical investigations will be essential to confirm whether the anabolic effects demonstrated in sarcopenia can be fully translated into therapeutic benefits in IBM patients. Careful evaluation of dosing, sustained pathway activation, and long-term safety in the context of a chronic degenerative myopathy will determine its ultimate utility in this challenging condition. Overall, 20-hydroxyecdysone (BIO101) stands out as a novel, mechanistically distinct anabolic agent that holds potential for restoring muscle function in IBM, warranting further investigative efforts to validate its therapeutic efficacy in this unmet clinical area (Dioh et al., 2023; Serova et al., 2024; Shanely et al., 2014).
