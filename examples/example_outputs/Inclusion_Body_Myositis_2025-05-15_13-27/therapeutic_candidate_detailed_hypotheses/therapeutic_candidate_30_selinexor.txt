Proposal for Selinexor

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of selinexor as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Selinexor is a fully synthetic, first‐in‐class small molecule designed to inhibit nuclear export selectively. Its discovery emerged from rational drug design efforts that were based on a detailed understanding of nucleocytoplasmic transport processes. In particular, extensive medicinal chemistry optimization led to the synthesis of selinexor as a representative of the Selective Inhibitors of Nuclear Export (SINE) compounds. These molecules were engineered to target exportin 1 (XPO1), also known as chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1), the primary receptor that transports proteins and RNAs bearing leucine‐rich nuclear export signals (NES) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Selinexor was designed to covalently bind to the Cys528 residue located within the cargo‐binding groove of exportin 1, thereby irreversibly (yet slowly reversibly) impairing its function. This high degree of specificity arises from its ability to disrupt the interaction between XPO1 and its cargo proteins without broadly affecting other cellular transport machinery. Because the binding to Cys528 directly prevents NES‐bearing proteins from being recognized and exported, selinexor achieves a selective functional blockade that was previously attempted using natural product inhibitors such as leptomycin B but with significantly improved safety and oral bioavailability profiles (Alhalabi et al., 2025; Ben‐Barouch & Kuruvilla, 2020). In contrast to natural products, selinexor is a completely synthetic molecule whose chemical structure was optimized to have favorable pharmacokinetics, including oral absorption and a defined volume of distribution that supports systemic exposure. Its development, originally oriented toward oncology applications, now underpins a repurposing strategy for diseases characterized by abnormal protein localization, such as IBM. In addition, the chemical optimization of selinexor has ensured that it is not only potent in blocking XPO1‐mediated export but also suitable for extended dosing regimens, which may be required in chronic, nonmalignant conditions (Bader et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History
Selinexor has an extensive history of evaluation in oncology, reflecting its role as a potent inhibitor of nuclear export used to restore the nuclear functions of tumor suppressor proteins. Initial preclinical work demonstrated that by trapping proteins such as p53, p21, and other growth regulators in the nucleus, selinexor is capable of reactivating pathways that lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. This mechanism provided the rationale for its development as an anticancer agent for diseases such as relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM), diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and even acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Ben‐Barouch & Kuruvilla, 2020; Syed, 2019). Several phase I and II clinical trials have established not only its efficacy but also a detailed pharmacokinetic and safety profile when administered orally. In addition to its application in hematologic malignancies, selinexor has been investigated in various solid tumors, where disruption of nuclear export was deemed a viable strategy to combat drug resistance. Interestingly, although selinexor was originally developed for oncology, a growing body of literature has considered whether therapeutic agents that interfere with nucleocytoplasmic transport may have benefits in treating diseases involving protein aggregation. Clinical trial searches using terms such as “Selinexor OR Xpovio OR XPO1 inhibitor AND (Inclusion Body Myositis OR muscle disease OR TDP‐43)” reveal increasing interest in exploring XPO1 inhibitors in conditions characterized by mislocalization of proteins, including IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although no clinical trials have definitively established selinexor’s efficacy in neuromuscular disorders to date, the robust anticancer experience with this compound provides a strong foundation for repurposing investigations. Moreover, in veterinary research, related SINE compounds have been used in animal models—most notably in canine lymphoma—to validate the broader therapeutic potential of nuclear export inhibitors (Kosyna & Depping, 2018). As such, selinexor’s therapeutic history is anchored in its well‐documented use in modulating nuclear export and suggests that similar mechanistic benefits may apply if the nuclear retention of key RNA‐binding proteins can be restored in muscles affected by IBM (Syed, 2019).

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, the principal mechanism of action of selinexor is the inhibition of XPO1‐mediated nuclear export. Under normal conditions, XPO1 recognizes and binds to proteins containing NES sequences, facilitating their translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via a Ran‐GTP‐dependent mechanism. Selinexor exploits a critical vulnerability in this pathway by binding specifically to the Cys528 residue found within the cargo‐binding groove of XPO1. By forming a covalent bond with this residue, selinexor effectively blocks the interaction between XPO1 and its cargo proteins, rendering the export process inactive (Ben‐Barouch & Kuruvilla, 2020; Bader et al., 2021). The resulting nuclear retention of multiple proteins has been shown to restore the function of tumor suppressor proteins in cancer cells.

In addition to its role in cancer, a key aspect of the repurposing hypothesis for IBM centers on the regulation of TDP‐43 localization. TDP‐43 is an RNA‐binding protein that normally resides in the nucleus where it plays an important role in RNA splicing and metabolism. In diseases such as IBM, there is aberrant nuclear export of TDP‐43 leading to its cytoplasmic accumulation and aggregation. This abnormal distribution is correlated with proteostatic disturbances, which in turn compromise muscle fiber function. Preclinical studies under conditions of mild oxidative stress have elucidated that TDP‐43 nuclear export is in part mediated by XPO1, since treatment with XPO1 inhibitors such as KPT‐185 has been shown to block the cytoplasmic relocalization of TDP‐43 in neuronal models (Marcus, 2021). Thus, by inhibiting XPO1, selinexor is expected to promote the nuclear retention of TDP‐43 and other similarly exported RNA‐binding proteins.

The biochemistry is highly specific because the interaction between selinexor and XPO1 is mediated by the modification of a single critical amino acid residue. This action not only prevents cargo binding but also partially inactivates the ability of XPO1 to engage with its collection of more than 200 proteins and RNAs. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that the inhibition of nuclear export by selinexor leads to a cascade of downstream effects such as cell cycle arrest and the activation of apoptosis, indicating that the nuclear retention of regulatory proteins has profound functional consequences. In the context of muscle cells, such modulation may re‐establish a balance in proteostasis by (a) enhancing the nuclear function of RNA‐processing factors like TDP‐43, (b) indirectly stimulating autophagic pathways due to the reduction in cytoplasmic aggregates, and (c) restoring normal cellular metabolism that has been disrupted by protein aggregation (Parvaz, 2024). Additionally, the detailed kinetic profile described in preclinical studies suggests that the inhibition of XPO1 is dose‐dependent, and the covalent but slowly reversible binding allows for sustained inhibition with potential for modulation over time (Ben‐Barouch & Kuruvilla, 2020). The overall specificity of selinexor’s mechanism—in which only proteins destined for export via XPO1 are affected—makes it an attractive candidate for diseases in which mislocalization of specific proteins, such as TDP‐43, contributes to pathology.

Expected Effect
The central hypothesis driving repurposing of selinexor in IBM is that inhibition of XPO1 will lead to the nuclear retention of TDP‐43 and, as a consequence, reduce its otherwise pathological accumulation in the cytoplasm. IBM is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration associated with both inflammatory and degenerative pathways, the latter of which includes the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions composed largely of mislocalized RNA‐binding proteins like TDP‐43. The expected therapeutic effect is that by preventing the nuclear export of TDP‐43, selinexor will help re‐establish normal nuclear functions in muscle cells. This, in turn, should reduce the proteostatic stress resulting from the abnormal aggregation of TDP‐43 in the cytosol and thereby support the recovery of proper protein synthesis and degradation pathways.

In an in vitro assay employing IBM myotubes, treatment with selinexor is expected to yield several measurable outcomes. First, immunofluorescence microscopy should demonstrate that TDP‐43—and likely other RNA‐binding proteins subject to XPO1‐mediated export—is redistributed from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Biochemical fractionation assays may reveal a corresponding decrease in the insoluble aggregate forms of TDP‐43 with an increase in its soluble nuclear counterpart. Additionally, markers of improved proteostasis, such as enhanced chaperone activity and upregulated autophagic flux, might be observed as downstream consequences of restoring nuclear retention. Finally, functional assays of muscle contractility could indicate improvements in parameters such as myotube contraction amplitude or endurance, reflecting the benefits of normalized protein homeostasis and improved cellular metabolism in muscle fibers (Marcus, 2021; Bader et al., 2021).

Moreover, selinexor’s favorable pharmacokinetic profile, as detailed in several studies, is supportive of its ability to achieve adequate tissue concentrations in muscle. Oral administration results in measurable plasma concentrations that translate into systemic exposure levels, with a volume of distribution that indicates penetration into extravascular compartments, including skeletal muscle (Bader et al., 2021). This tissue penetration is crucial because any therapeutic effect in IBM must be mediated by the drug reaching affected muscle fibers at concentrations sufficient to inhibit XPO1 consistently over a dosing interval. Preclinical animal models evaluated for anticancer activity with selinexor have demonstrated that sustained dosing can maintain inhibitory concentrations in multiple tissues; although similar studies in muscle are limited, the underlying pharmacokinetic parameters are promising for the context of a chronic neuromuscular disease.

The expected molecular mechanism in muscle would follow a logic analogous to that demonstrated in cancer and neuronal models: when oxidative or other stress conditions drive abnormal nuclear export of TDP‐43, administration of selinexor would rapidly inhibit XPO1 activity and prevent further export. With repeated dosing, the cumulative effect should be a restored equilibrium wherein the majority of TDP‐43 is maintained within the nucleus, thereby reducing its cytoplasmic toxic accumulation and enabling proteostasis. Ultimately, the normalization of TDP‐43 distribution is anticipated to lead to improved muscle cell metabolism, reduced aggregate‐driven toxicity, and enhanced contractile function—key therapeutic endpoints in IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Marcus, 2021).

Overall Evaluation
Based on the data and literature reviewed, selinexor appears to be a promising candidate for repurposing as a disease‐modifying therapy for Inclusion Body Myositis. Its well‐characterized synthetic origins and the robust mechanistic rationale provided by its action as a selective inhibitor of XPO1 offer a strong foundation for this hypothesis. The major strengths and weaknesses of selinexor in this context are discussed below.

Strengths
1. Established Synthetic Origin and Mechanistic Specificity:
Selinexor is entirely synthetic and has been optimized through rational drug design for selective inhibition of nuclear export by targeting the Cys528 residue of XPO1. This specificity means that the effect of the compound is directly linked to the modulation of the nuclear export pathway without broadly compromising cellular function outside of this route (Alhalabi et al., 2025; Ben‐Barouch & Kuruvilla, 2020). In IBM, where mislocalization of TDP‐43 plays a central pathological role, such targeted intervention is highly attractive. The detailed biochemical understanding of XPO1’s binding properties supports the notion that a similar inhibitory mechanism in muscle cells could correct abnormal protein distribution.

2. Broad Therapeutic History and Clinical Experience:
The extensive preclinical and clinical evaluations of selinexor in oncology provide a well‐documented safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profile. Its successful use in relapsed and refractory hematologic malignancies demonstrates that sufficient systemic exposure can be achieved via oral dosing (Syed, 2019; Ben‐Barouch & Kuruvilla, 2020; Garzon et al., 2017). Although selinexor has not yet been directly applied to IBM in clinical practice, the repurposing rationale is supported by similar pathomechanisms of protein mislocalization observed in both oncology and neurodegenerative conditions. The fact that related XPO1 inhibitors have been explored in varied species—including in veterinary settings—points to a potential translational breadth that could be harnessed for IBM.

3. Mechanistic Rationale Targeting a Core Pathological Process:
A central aspect of IBM pathology is the aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP‐43, which disrupts normal RNA metabolism and proteostasis. By blocking the nuclear export of TDP‐43 via inhibition of XPO1, selinexor may restore the proper nuclear pool of this RNA‐binding protein, thus re‐establishing the normal regulation of splicing and mRNA processing in muscle fibers. This intervention has been indirectly validated in neuronal models in which XPO1 inhibition reduced TDP‐43 cytoplasmic aggregation and improved cell viability under stress conditions (Marcus, 2021). Therefore, the proposed mechanism in muscle is not only plausible but also grounded in prior biochemical observations.

4. Favorable Pharmacokinetic Profile and Feasibility of Repurposing:
Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that selinexor is orally bioavailable with a relatively predictable plasma half‐life, and its extensive tissue distribution suggests that therapeutic concentrations are achievable in peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle (Bader et al., 2021). This aspect is critical for any treatment aimed at IBM, a disease where targeting the affected muscle tissue is essential. Moreover, since selinexor is already approved for clinical use in oncology, the repurposing pathway may be streamlined with an abundance of existing clinical data available to guide dose‐finding and safety assessments in a new patient population.

Weaknesses and Challenges
1. Limited Direct Evidence in Muscle‐Specific Models:
Despite the compelling theoretical rationale, direct experimental evidence demonstrating the efficacy of selinexor in muscle‐specific models of IBM is currently lacking. Most mechanistic and pharmacokinetic data come from oncology and neuronal studies. There is a pressing need for targeted preclinical studies in IBM animal models or cultured human myotubes to directly assess whether XPO1 inhibition by selinexor can correct TDP‐43 mislocalization and improve muscle function (Nakayama et al., 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). These studies would be critical to validate the translatability of the oncologic and neurodegenerative paradigms to the context of a muscular dystrophy.

2. Potential Adverse Effects and Safety Concerns:
In clinical trials for cancer, selinexor has been associated with several adverse events including gastrointestinal toxicity, hematological suppression, and fatigue. IBM predominantly affects older individuals, who may be more susceptible to such side effects. Any repurposing effort would require rigorous dose optimization to ensure that the doses used to achieve meaningful effects on nuclear export in muscle do not elicit intolerable toxicity in a vulnerable population. This balance between efficacy and tolerability will need to be carefully studied in early‐phase clinical trials specifically designed for neuromuscular patients (Syed, 2019; Kosyna & Depping, 2018).

3. Complexity of Nuclear Export Regulation in Muscle Cells:
While XPO1 is a central mediator of nuclear export in many cell types, the regulation of this process can vary with cellular context. Muscle cells may possess unique or redundant nuclear export mechanisms that are not as prominent in cancer cells. If the nuclear export of TDP‐43 in muscle fibers is governed in part by alternate pathways, then inhibiting XPO1 alone may not be sufficient to restore normal protein localization. Understanding the full complement of nucleocytoplasmic transport regulation in muscle tissue will be critical for predicting the therapeutic efficacy of selinexor in IBM (Kosyna & Depping, 2018).

4. Translational Considerations When Repurposing an Oncology Agent:
Even though selinexor’s pharmacokinetics and safety have been characterized in oncology patients, the translation of these findings to IBM is not straightforward. The chronic, slowly progressive nature of IBM differs markedly from the rapidly evolving oncologic conditions for which selinexor was developed. Consequently, long‐term dosing regimens may need to be modified, and the impact of cumulative toxicity must be re‐assessed. The differences in disease pathophysiology, patient demographics, and treatment duration between cancer and IBM could complicate the clinical development pathway for this repurposing effort.

Expected Therapeutic Outcome and Future Directions
In the proposed therapeutic model, administration of selinexor in IBM would primarily aim to redistribute TDP‐43 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in affected myotubes. Based on available evidence, it is expected that inhibition of XPO1 will lead to reduced formation of cytoplasmic TDP‐43 aggregates, which are implicated in disrupting RNA metabolic processes and impairing proteostasis. Improved nuclear retention of TDP‐43 would in theory restore normal pathways of mRNA splicing and transcriptional regulation. As a downstream effect, muscle fibers could recover some degree of normal function, reflected in increased contractile capacity and decreased cellular stress. Preclinical assays should focus on documenting the subcellular localization of TDP‐43 via immunofluorescence, quantifying soluble versus aggregated protein pools using biochemical fractionation, and ultimately assessing improvements in muscle fiber contractility in vitro (Marcus, 2021; Bader et al., 2021).

In addition, future studies should establish biomarkers that can reliably indicate target engagement in muscle tissue. For example, a reduction in cytoplasmic TDP‐43 levels or an increase in nuclear retention might serve as surrogate markers for efficacy. Animal models that recapitulate IBM pathology will also be essential. These would enable detailed pharmacodynamic studies to define the optimal dosing regimen that maximizes target engagement in muscle while minimizing systemic toxicity. Given the already extensive clinical experience with selinexor in oncology, dose‐escalation studies in an IBM setting could build on known pharmacokinetic parameters such as half‐life, systemic clearance, and volume of distribution (Bader et al., 2021).

Another future direction involves exploring combination therapies. It is possible that the effects of selinexor could be amplified when used alongside other treatments that modulate proteostasis, such as enhancers of autophagy or chaperone inducers. Such combination approaches might achieve a more complete correction of the cellular abnormalities seen in IBM, achieving synergy between mechanisms that restore nuclear homeostasis and those that promote the clearance of existing protein aggregates. This strategy may be particularly relevant if alternative nuclear export pathways in muscle cells limit the efficacy of selinexor when used as a monotherapy.

Overall Evaluation
In summary, selinexor represents a highly promising candidate for repurposing as a disease‐modifying therapy in the context of Inclusion Body Myositis. Its mechanism—selective inhibition of XPO1‐mediated nuclear export—directly addresses a core pathological feature of IBM, namely the mislocalization and aggregation of TDP‐43 and potentially other RNA‐binding proteins. The synthetic origin and rigorous chemical optimization of selinexor provide confidence in its specificity and pharmacokinetic behavior, which have been well characterized in oncology settings (Alhalabi et al., 2025; Ben‐Barouch & Kuruvilla, 2020). Moreover, extensive clinical and preclinical investigations in cancer have generated substantial data on its efficacy, tolerability, and tissue distribution, all of which are encouraging for repurposing efforts.

Strengths of using selinexor include its robust mechanistic rationale, supported by evidence that XPO1 plays a pivotal role in the nuclear export of TDP‐43 under stress conditions (Marcus, 2021). The compound’s well‐defined pharmacokinetic parameters and oral bioavailability further bolster its candidacy, ensuring that therapeutic concentrations can be achieved in skeletal muscle. Additionally, the overall clinical experience with selinexor as an anticancer agent provides a substantial foundation for dose optimization and safety assessments in a new clinical setting.

However, significant challenges persist. The current lack of direct evidence in muscle‐specific preclinical models means that further targeted research is necessary to validate the expected correction of TDP‐43 trafficking in IBM myotubes. The potential toxicity of selinexor in a patient population that tends to be older and more frail than oncologic cohorts poses another concern that must be carefully addressed through dose titration studies. Finally, the inherent complexity of nucleocytoplasmic transport regulation in muscle cells may require a more nuanced understanding of whether XPO1 inhibition alone will suffice or if compensatory mechanisms might undermine the therapeutic efficacy of selinexor.

In light of these considerations, the repurposing of selinexor for IBM is scientifically compelling and worthy of further investigation. It is recommended that a series of rigorous preclinical studies be undertaken using human muscle cell models and animal models of IBM pathology to evaluate tissue‐specific pharmacodynamics, confirm the nuclear re‐localization of TDP‐43, and assess improvements in muscle function. Additionally, it will be critical to establish appropriate biomarkers that can signal effective target engagement in muscle tissue during subsequent clinical studies. Overall, selinexor’s established clinical track record in oncology, combined with its precise and specific mode of action, supports further exploratory studies that could ultimately pave the way for its use as a novel therapeutic approach in IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kosyna & Depping, 2018).

Conclusion
In conclusion, the comprehensive literature review suggests that selinexor holds significant promise for repurposing as a therapy for Inclusion Body Myositis. Its synthetic origin, optimized pharmacokinetics, and selective mechanism of blocking XPO1‐mediated nuclear export provide a strong scientific rationale for its use in restoring the normal nuclear localization of TDP‐43 and other RNA‐binding proteins. This, in turn, could correct critical proteostatic disturbances in IBM myotubes and improve muscle contractility. While the majority of existing data comes from cancer and neurodegenerative models, the parallels in nuclear export dysfunction provide a credible basis for extending the application of selinexor to IBM. Nonetheless, the challenges related to tissue‐specific pharmacodynamics, safety in an older and more vulnerable population, and potential compensatory pathways in muscle require detailed preclinical and translational research. The convergence of biochemical, clinical, and pharmacokinetic data makes selinexor an attractive candidate that justifies further investigation in rigorously designed studies. As our understanding of the molecular pathology of IBM advances, it is anticipated that targeting nucleocytoplasmic transport will emerge as a critical strategy in treating this debilitating disease. Given the inherent strengths and acknowledged limitations of selinexor, a methodical approach that begins with preclinical muscle models and leverages existing clinical experience in oncology is warranted. Through these steps, the potential for selinexor to provide a disease‐modifying treatment for Inclusion Body Myositis can be fully evaluated, with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes in a condition where current treatment options remain largely palliative (Bader et al., 2021; Syed, 2019).

In summary, selinexor’s well‐documented mechanism of action, favorable systemic exposure properties, and broad clinical validation in oncology strongly support its further development as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for IBM. Rigorous preclinical and translational studies are essential to confirm that the nuclear export inhibition achieved by selinexor in muscle cells translates into meaningful clinical benefits, including restored proteostasis and improved contractile function in affected myotubes.
