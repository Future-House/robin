Proposal for ML-SA1

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
ML‐SA1 is a synthetic small‐molecule agonist specifically developed to activate TRPML1, a lysosomal Ca²⁺ channel that controls diverse lysosomal functions such as calcium release, membrane trafficking, exocytosis, and autophagy regulation (Gu, 2020). Originally discovered during biochemical screens targeting TRPML1 activity, ML‐SA1 belongs to a class of agents that modulate lysosomal ion channels by stabilizing the channel’s open conformation independent of endogenous lipid agonists like PI(3,5)P₂ (Feng et al., 2014). Over the past years, compounds of this class have been extensively used in preclinical studies to probe the roles of lysosomal calcium in cellular clearance pathways. ML‐SA1, as a selective TRPML1 activator, exemplifies this strategy, and its chemical synthesis involves standard organic synthetic routes that yield a molecule capable of permeating cellular membranes, allowing it to reach intracellular lysosomes where TRPML1 is expressed (Gu, 2020). This candidate is representative of the novel approach of directly modulating lysosomal function via targeted ion channel activation—in this case, by enhancing lysosomal calcium release, which in turn has multiple downstream cellular effects, especially on autophagy and membrane repair.

Therapeutic History:
To date, ML‐SA1 and related TRPML1 agonists have been primarily evaluated in preclinical models investigating lysosomal storage disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and models of muscular dystrophy (Yu, 2019). In models of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), for instance, pharmacological activation of TRPML1 with ML‐SA1 analogs has been shown to promote lysosomal exocytosis and improve membrane repair in muscle fibers, leading to reduced muscle damage, improved muscle force, and decreased markers of necrosis (Gu, 2020; Yu, 2019). Although there have been no well‐documented clinical trials specifically addressing Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) with ML‐SA1, ongoing clinical trials targeting TRPML1 for myopathies and related muscle diseases indicate that there is growing translational interest in using TRPML1 activators as therapeutic agents for conditions characterized by lysosomal dysfunction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Beyond muscular dystrophy, preclinical research in neural cell models has demonstrated that activation of TRPML1 via ML‐SA1 can mitigate neurotoxic stress, improve autophagic clearance, and reduce protein aggregate build‐up (Tedeschi et al., 2019), which parallels the pathophysiological mechanisms observed in IBM. This historical therapeutic context provides a compelling rationale for repurposing ML‐SA1 from its original indications to IBM, as both diseases share common underlying features such as impaired autophagy, accumulation of intracellular aggregates, and disrupted lysosomal calcium signaling.

Mechanism of Action:
ML‐SA1 acts through a well‐defined mechanism of selectively binding to TRPML1 in lysosomal membranes and inducing a conformational change that favors the open state of the channel (Feng et al., 2014). Once activated, TRPML1 mediates the release of Ca²⁺ from the lysosomal lumen into the cytosol, which is critical for several downstream cellular events. One major consequence of the induced lysosomal Ca²⁺ release is the activation of calcineurin, a Ca²⁺/calmodulin‐dependent phosphatase that dephosphorylates transcription factor EB (TFEB) (Yu, 2019). Dephosphorylated TFEB then translocates into the nucleus where it upregulates the expression of lysosomal and autophagic genes, a collection of genes that comprise the Coordinated Lysosomal Expression and Regulation (CLEAR) network (Gu, 2020; Yu, 2019). Besides TFEB activation, lysosomal Ca²⁺ released by TRPML1 also promotes lysosomal exocytosis—a process vital for plasma membrane repair in muscle cells—by facilitating the fusion of lysosomes with the sarcolemma (Gu, 2020; Yu, 2019). This interplay is particularly significant in muscle repair pathways where a rapid and efficient resealing of the plasma membrane is essential to combat ongoing mechanical stress. Additionally, ML‐SA1 is known to trigger retrograde lysosomal transport by modulating calcium‐sensitive SNARE proteins and cytoskeletal motors, further ensuring that autophagosomes are efficiently fused with lysosomes to degrade damaged proteins and organelles (Yu, 2019). The high specificity of ML‐SA1 to TRPML1 means that its use results in minimal off‐target effects, and this precision makes it an attractive candidate for therapeutic intervention in diseases where lysosomal dysfunction is a critical factor—such as Inclusion Body Myositis.

Expected Effect:
For Inclusion Body Myositis, the central hypothesis is that impaired autophagy and lysosomal dysfunction contribute significantly to the accumulation of protein aggregates and consequent muscle degeneration. Activation of TRPML1 by ML‐SA1 is anticipated to restore lysosomal Ca²⁺ signaling in myotubes derived from IBM patients, thereby correcting a critical cellular defect (Yu, 2019). When ML‐SA1 stimulates TRPML1, the burst of lysosomal Ca²⁺ triggers downstream signaling cascades resulting in the nuclear translocation of TFEB. In the nucleus, TFEB binds to CLEAR motifs and thereby induces a transcriptional program that enhances lysosomal biogenesis and autophagic flux. This upregulation should theoretically facilitate the clearance of misfolded proteins and toxic aggregates that are hallmarks of IBM pathology (Gu, 2020; Yu, 2019). In addition to clearing aggregates, the enhanced lysosomal exocytosis means that damaged cellular membranes, such as the sarcolemma of myotubes, are more efficiently repaired, ultimately improving contractility and overall muscle cell health (Yu, 2019). Preclinical data from rodent models of muscular dystrophy have already demonstrated that ML‐SA1 analogs can distribute into muscle tissue following systemic administration and that they reduce markers of muscle damage while improving functional outcomes (Yu, 2019). Extrapolating these findings to IBM, one could expect that ML‐SA1 treatment will not only clear pathological protein inclusions but also restore the cellular capacity for autophagic clearance and membrane repair, which in turn could translate into improved muscle strength, reduced fibrosis, and overall better muscle performance in patients with IBM.

Overall Evaluation:
ML‐SA1 emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis due to its targeted mechanism of action, demonstrable efficacy in preclinical muscle disease models, and ability to modulate key pathological mechanisms underlying IBM. One of the major strengths of ML‐SA1 is its specificity for TRPML1, ensuring that its activation leads to a cascade of beneficial cellular processes, including lysosomal calcium release, TFEB activation, autophagy enhancement, and improved lysosomal exocytosis (Gu, 2020; Yu, 2019). Furthermore, its chemical structure as a synthetic small molecule not only facilitates robust production and formulation but also offers favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including muscle tissue distribution, as shown in rodent studies (Yu, 2019). The expected outcome in IBM myotubes is that direct modulation of lysosomal calcium, via ML‐SA1, will restore cellular protein homeostasis by eliminating aggregates and repairing membrane damage, thereby improving contractility. This hypothesis is innovative because it addresses a fundamental cellular defect in IBM—a block in autophagic clearance—by directly enhancing lysosomal function through TRPML1 activation (Yu, 2019).

However, there are also some weaknesses and uncertainties that merit consideration. First, although there is compelling preclinical evidence in muscular dystrophy and neurodegenerative models, the direct application of ML‐SA1 in IBM has not been extensively validated, and the pathophysiological nuances of IBM may introduce unique challenges that differ from other muscle diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while activation of TFEB is beneficial for lysosomal biogenesis, excessive autophagy activation could potentially have deleterious effects in muscle, and balancing the degree of activation will be critical to avoid unwanted catabolic effects (Yu, 2019). Moreover, long‐term effects of chronic TRPML1 activation remain underexplored, and potential issues such as compensatory downregulation or off‐target effects in non‐muscle tissues require thorough investigation (Yu, 2019). Finally, while rodent PK studies have shown promising muscle distribution, the translation of these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles to human subjects needs to be rigorously evaluated in clinical trials focused specifically on IBM.

In summary, ML‐SA1’s ability to enhance lysosomal Ca²⁺ release and thereby trigger TFEB nuclear translocation and upregulate autophagy presents a mechanistically sound and innovative approach for treating Inclusion Body Myositis. Its past success in ameliorating muscle pathology in DMD models, combined with its potent and selective mechanism of action, provide strong support for further testing in IBM. However, additional research—both preclinical studies in IBM-specific models and early-phase human trials—will be essential to validate efficacy and safety in the context of IBM. Overall, while there are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with any novel therapeutic approach, the potential benefits of restoring lysosomal function and autophagic clearance in diseased muscle tissues make ML‐SA1 an attractive candidate that merits further investigation (Gu, 2020; Yu, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
