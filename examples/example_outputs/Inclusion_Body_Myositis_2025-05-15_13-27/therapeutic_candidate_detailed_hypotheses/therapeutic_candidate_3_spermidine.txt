Proposal for Spermidine

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Spermidine is a naturally occurring polyamine present in all living cells that plays a critical role in cellular growth, proliferation, and homeostasis. Originally discovered in semen and later identified in a variety of dietary sources, spermidine is biosynthesized endogenously via the polyamine pathway and can also be supplemented through the diet. It belongs to the class of small naturally occurring polyamines, which also includes putrescine and spermine. Polyamines have been implicated historically in longevity and stress resistance, and have been explored as nutraceuticals for their cytoprotective properties. In particular, the use of spermidine has been promoted in several preclinical models of aging and muscle degeneration, where it functions primarily as an autophagy inducer. Its chemical structure permits it to interact with DNA, RNA, and proteins, thereby modulating acetylation, mitochondrial function, and protein homeostasis. This candidate is appealing for repurposing because of its oral bioavailability, well‐documented absorption–distribution–metabolism–excretion (ADME) profile, and low toxicity as a naturally occurring dietary component (Madeo et al., 2019; Freitag, 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Spermidine has a well-documented history in preclinical research, primarily focusing on its effects as an autophagy inducer and its capability to extend lifespan via enhanced proteostasis and mitochondrial quality control. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that spermidine supplementation can restore autophagic flux in aged tissues and prevent degenerative changes in multiple organ systems, including the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. In particular, animal studies in models of muscular dystrophies – such as the collagen VI-deficient mouse model – have shown that oral or intraperitoneal administration of spermidine ameliorates myopathic defects, improves mitochondrial integrity, and reduces apoptosis in muscle fibers (Chrisam et al., 2015; Gambarotto et al., 2023). Although there is compelling preclinical evidence demonstrating beneficial effects on muscle pathology in contexts such as aging and collagen VI-related myopathies, a targeted search on ClinicalTrials.gov combining spermidine with terms like “Inclusion Body Myositis,” “muscle disease,” and “autophagy induction” has yielded no registered clinical trials to date (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This clearly indicates that while spermidine has been studied extensively in related muscle diseases and aging models, it has not yet been directly tested in clinical trials for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). The available safety data from pilot studies and nutritional interventions support its low toxicity profile, creating a strong rationale for repurposing this compound for IBM if translational preclinical data continue to be positive (Galasso et al., 2023; Chrisam et al., 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
Spermidine exerts its effects primarily by acting as a robust inducer of autophagy—a cellular degradation process essential for clearing damaged organelles, misfolded protein aggregates, and other cellular debris. One of the key mechanisms by which spermidine induces autophagy is through the inhibition of the acetyltransferase EP300. EP300 normally functions to acetylate autophagy-related proteins, thereby repressing their activity. Inhibition of EP300 by spermidine reduces the acetylation of proteins such as ATG5, ATG7, and LC3, facilitating the formation of autophagosomes and promoting autophagic flux (Cervelli et al., 2018; Zimmermann et al., 2023). Additionally, spermidine is known to activate transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy gene expression. TFEB activation leads to the upregulation of genes required for generating lysosomes and other components of the autophagy machinery, thereby enhancing the degradation capacity of cells. This dual mechanism—EP300 inhibition coupled with TFEB activation—results in enhanced clearance of protein aggregates and improvement in cellular proteostasis. Furthermore, spermidine modulates key intracellular signaling pathways, such as decreasing AKT phosphorylation. Reduced AKT activity lifts the inhibition on FOXO transcription factors, which then translocate into the nucleus and promote the expression of autophagy genes (Chrisam et al., 2015; Galasso et al., 2023). Recent investigations also highlight the role of spermidine-induced hypusination of translation factors (e.g., EIF5A) in promoting the synthesis of autophagy proteins, further enhancing autophagic capacity (Hofer et al., 2021). This intricate network of molecular interactions underpins spermidine’s abilities not only in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and cellular quality control but also in restoring muscle cellular function under pathological conditions (Cervelli et al., 2018; Chrisam et al., 2015).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed hypothesis for Inclusion Body Myositis, spermidine is expected to activate TFEB in IBM patient-derived myotubes, which would then lead to increased lysosomal biogenesis and improved autophagic clearance of protein inclusions. IBM is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins, impaired autophagic flux, and eventual muscle fiber degeneration. By enhancing autophagy, spermidine should facilitate the degradation of these pathogenic protein aggregates, thereby improving proteostasis within the myotubes. In parallel, the inhibition of EP300 is anticipated to augment autophagic induction by reducing inhibitory acetylation events on key autophagy proteins. Together, these mechanisms are expected to restore autophagic flux and cellular homeostasis, resulting in improved force generation in the muscle fibers (Galasso et al., 2023; Chrisam et al., 2015). There is precedent for this expected effect: in collagen VI-related myopathies, spermidine treatment has been shown to ameliorate histological defects, normalize mitochondrial function, reduce apoptosis, and even trend towards improved muscle strength (Chrisam et al., 2015; Gambarotto et al., 2023). Moreover, studies in models of muscle aging have demonstrated that spermidine supplementation can enhance autophagic flux and promote the clearance of damaged mitochondria and protein aggregates, potentially leading to improved contractile performance (Galasso et al., 2023; Freitag, 2023). In the context of IBM patient-derived myotubes, these effects could translate into enhanced force generation and overall improved muscle cell viability. Crucially, TFEB activation has been directly linked to improvements in lysosomal function and proteostasis in muscle cells, and since TFEB is expressed and functional in skeletal muscle, it becomes a valid target for this strategy (Cervelli et al., 2018; Chrisam et al., 2015).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, spermidine represents a promising candidate for the repurposing strategy aimed at treating Inclusion Body Myositis due to its multifaceted ability to enhance autophagy and promote cellular homeostasis. One of the major strengths of spermidine is its established safety profile as a naturally occurring dietary polyamine, along with well-documented ADME characteristics and minimal toxicity in both preclinical models and pilot human studies (Madeo et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The molecular mechanism by which spermidine acts—through EP300 inhibition, TFEB activation, and modulation of the AKT-FOXO signaling axis—is robust and supported by preclinical evidence in diverse muscle disease models, including collagen VI-deficient mice and models of muscle aging (Chrisam et al., 2015; Cervelli et al., 2018; Galasso et al., 2023). The expected effect in IBM, which includes the activation of autophagy leading to enhanced lysosomal biogenesis and clearance of protein inclusions, addresses key pathogenic events in IBM pathology, such as protein aggregate accumulation and impaired muscle fiber function (Galasso et al., 2023; Freitag, 2023).

However, there are several challenges and weaknesses to consider. Although spermidine’s action in muscle diseases has been well established in various preclinical models, direct data on its efficacy in IBM is currently lacking, as noted by the absence of clinical trials specifically targeting IBM with spermidine (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This gap necessitates rigorous preclinical validation in IBM-specific models before clinical translation. Additionally, while spermidine is known to induce autophagy via EP300 inhibition and TFEB activation, the precise regulation of these pathways can be dose-dependent, with excessive autophagy potentially leading to adverse cellular effects; indeed, some studies have noted that high doses of spermidine in wild-type models may induce excessive autophagic activity and apoptosis (Chrisam et al., 2015; Galasso et al., 2023). Therefore, dosing optimization will be critical for ensuring a therapeutic window that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks. Another consideration is the translation of improved autophagic clearance into functional improvements in force generation. While preclinical models of collagen VI-related myopathies have demonstrated promising histological and ultrastructural recovery, it remains to be shown that these molecular changes translate into significant functional gains in the context of IBM, which has complex and multifactorial pathogenesis (Chrisam et al., 2015; Gambarotto et al., 2023).

From a target validation perspective, the hypothesis that spermidine will activate TFEB in IBM patient-derived myotubes is well grounded in the literature linking TFEB activation to improved lysosomal biogenesis and clearance of pathological protein aggregates. TFEB is a critical regulator of autophagy and is expressed in skeletal muscle cells, where it drives the transcription of lysosomal and autophagy-related genes. The evidence supporting spermidine’s ability to modulate TFEB and other autophagic pathways is compelling, particularly in the context of muscle maintenance and aging (Cervelli et al., 2018; Hofer et al., 2024). This mechanistic insight supports the potential translational applicability of spermidine in IBM, where the accumulation of protein inclusions is a hallmark pathological feature.

In summary, the repurposing of spermidine for Inclusion Body Myositis is based on a strong mechanistic rationale and is supported by a robust body of preclinical evidence in related muscle diseases and aging models. Its multifactorial mechanism—including EP300 inhibition, TFEB activation, AKT-FOXO pathway modulation, and enhancement of autophagic flux—directly addresses the deficits observed in IBM, such as impaired proteostasis and lysosomal dysfunction. The therapeutic advantages of an orally administrable, low-toxicity compound further enhance its appeal as a candidate for further investigation (Chrisam et al., 2015; Madeo et al., 2019). Notwithstanding these strengths, the absence of direct preclinical and clinical data in IBM, the challenge of dosing optimization, and the potential for off-target effects remain important hurdles that must be addressed. Nonetheless, given the current evidence base and the promising mechanistic attributes, spermidine offers a novel and feasible approach for targeting autophagy defects in IBM, warranting further preclinical studies in IBM-specific models and subsequent early-phase clinical trials to fully determine its efficacy and safety in this patient population (Galasso et al., 2023; Chrisam et al., 2015).

Overall, while additional data and rigorous translational studies are required, the scientific proposal for employing spermidine as a repurposed drug candidate in Inclusion Body Myositis is well supported by the current literature on autophagy induction, proteostasis, and muscle regeneration. This candidate presents a promising avenue of therapeutic intervention that leverages known mechanisms of action in a novel context, and its further evaluation could significantly advance drug development efforts in this challenging muscle disease.
