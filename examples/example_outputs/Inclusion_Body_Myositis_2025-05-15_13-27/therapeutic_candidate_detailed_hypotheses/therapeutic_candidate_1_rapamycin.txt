Proposal for Rapamycin (Sirolimus)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rapamycin, also known as sirolimus, was originally isolated as a natural macrolide produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus and has since been developed as a key member of the mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitors—a class of compounds with potent immunosuppressive and anti‐proliferative properties (Perl, 2016). Its discovery stemmed from investigations into soil microorganisms, and its chemical structure features a macrocyclic lactone core which confers its unique ability to bind to the intracellular protein FKBP12, thereby forming a complex that targets mTORC1 specifically (Perl, 2016). Rapamycin belongs to the class of rapalogs or mTOR inhibitors, which have been extensively investigated both in experimental models and clinically, primarily for their immunomodulatory effects in transplantation medicine, and more recently as modulators of aging and various proteinopathies (Konopka et al., 2023). This compound was synthesized and optimized over decades since its initial discovery and later repurposed to act as a targeted inhibitor of mTORC1—a key regulator of protein synthesis, cellular metabolism, and autophagy—with its well-characterized safety profile in humans forming the backbone for its repurposing strategy in neuromuscular disorders such as Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) (Harinath et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Rapamycin has a long and storied therapeutic history; originally approved for use in transplant patients to prevent organ rejection due to its immunosuppressive effects (ClinicalTrials.gov). Over the years, rapamycin has also been employed in oncology and aging studies, and its pharmacokinetics have been characterized extensively in both animal models and human subjects (Evans et al., 2021). In several preclinical muscle disease models—including those resembling aspects of IBM pathology—rapamycin enhanced autophagic flux, reduced protein aggregate burden, and improved overall muscle function, suggesting its promise in conditions characterized by impaired autophagy and proteostasis (Lilleker et al., 2019; Reyngoudt et al., 2024). Although rapamycin has not been approved specifically for IBM, several clinical trials (for example, NCT02481453 and NCT04789070) are currently evaluating its efficacy and safety in IBM and related neuromuscular disorders, thereby providing a translational bridge from its known applications to this underserved therapeutic area (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022). Moreover, previous studies in muscle aging and sarcopenia models, as well as in neuromuscular conditions such as VCP-associated multisystem proteinopathy, have shown that rapamycin can modify disease progression, albeit with nuances regarding dosing and potential adverse effects (Joseph et al., 2019; Korb, Kimonis, & Mozaffar, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
Rapamycin’s mechanism of action is centered on its ability to form a complex with the immunophilin FKBP12, an interaction that enables the compound to allosterically inhibit the mTORC1 complex, thereby dampening its kinase activity (Perl, 2016). mTORC1 is a critical regulator of cellular protein synthesis; it phosphorylates substrates such as S6K1 and 4E-BP1 to promote translation initiation, while simultaneously suppressing autophagy by phosphorylating key autophagy-initiating proteins like ULK1 (Kaiser, 2019). In the context of IBM, mTORC1 hyperactivity is postulated to be a central driver of autophagic inhibition, leading to the accumulation of pathological protein aggregates including TDP-43 and β-amyloid, as well as inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Lin et al., 2022; Lilleker et al., 2019). By inhibiting mTORC1, rapamycin is expected to reinstate autophagic flux, thereby facilitating the clearance of these toxic aggregates and reducing ER stress, which in turn could improve sarcomere organization and contractile force in IBM patient-derived myotubes (Selvarani et al., 2021; Perl, 2016). This direct engagement with mTORC1 has been characterized in multiple studies involving preclinical myotube assays and animal models, where rapamycin treatment resulted in enhanced autophagy and improved muscle fiber morphology (Joseph et al., 2019; Konopka et al., 2023). The compound’s pharmacological action is both rapid and specific, with established oral formulations that allow for predictable dosing regimens, which is critical given that over-suppression of mTOR activity may lead to undesirable side effects such as impaired muscle protein synthesis (Konopka et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay using IBM patient-derived myotubes, rapamycin is expected to inhibit mTORC1 hyperactivity, thereby restoring autophagic flux that is otherwise impaired in these cells (Lilleker et al., 2019; Perl, 2016). Under normal conditions, mTORC1 hyperactivation in IBM contributes to the reduced clearance of misfolded proteins and toxic aggregates including TDP-43 and β-amyloid, which are key pathological features observed in the disease (Han et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022). The anticipated pharmacodynamic effect is the enhanced formation and turnover of autophagosomes, as evidenced by increased LC3-II levels and decreased p62 accumulation—biochemical markers that have been validated in both sarcopenia and proteinopathy models (Joseph et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2022). In addition, by reducing ER stress through autophagy enhancement, rapamycin is expected to mitigate the secondary pathogenic cascades that lead to muscle fiber degeneration and disrupted sarcomere architecture (Selvarani et al., 2021; Harinath et al., 2024). The reduction in aggregate burdens and the alleviation of ER stress should, in theory, translate into improved contractile force and better overall muscle cell function, which are critical endpoints in IBM (Lilleker et al., 2019; Reyngoudt et al., 2024). The expression of key autophagy-related genes in myotubes derived from IBM patients further supports the mechanistic rationale, since restoring autophagy has been shown to normalize proteostasis in similar models (Perl, 2016; Joseph et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, rapamycin exhibits strong promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis due to its well-documented ability to inhibit mTORC1, thereby restoring autophagic flux and reducing the accumulation of deleterious protein aggregates that are central to IBM pathogenesis (Konopka et al., 2023; Lilleker et al., 2019). One significant strength of rapamycin lies in its extensive clinical history and established safety profile in various patient populations, particularly in solid organ transplantation and oncology, which provides a robust foundation for its repurposing in IBM (Evans et al., 2021; Harinath et al., 2024). The fact that rapamycin is available in oral formulations with well-understood dosing regimens further supports its feasibility for long-term use in IBM patients, whose treatment options are currently limited (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov). Additionally, preclinical evidence from muscle disease models and myotube assays has consistently shown that mTORC1 inhibition can ameliorate features of muscle degeneration by enhancing autophagy, thereby supporting the hypothesis that rapamycin might clear TDP-43 and β-amyloid aggregates while reducing ER stress (Joseph et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2022).

Nonetheless, there are several challenges and potential weaknesses associated with repurposing rapamycin for IBM. While mTORC1 inhibition is critical for enhancing autophagy, excessive or prolonged inhibition may also suppress muscle protein synthesis and negatively impact muscle repair and regeneration, thereby necessitating a delicate balance in dosing (Konopka et al., 2023; Perl, 2016). Moreover, although rapamycin has been widely studied in transplant and aging settings, direct clinical data in IBM is still emerging, and the precise effects on sarcomere organization and contractile force in IBM patient-derived myotubes require further experimental validation (Lilleker et al., 2019; Reyngoudt et al., 2024). There have also been reports that autophagy modulation can have context-dependent outcomes—some preclinical models have even suggested that rapamycin-induced autophagy might aggravate muscle pathology under certain conditions, underscoring the need for careful patient selection and dosing strategies (Korb, Kimonis, & Mozaffar, 2021; Schmidt et al., 2017). Furthermore, the immunosuppressive effects of rapamycin, although generally manageable, may pose risks in IBM patients who are often older and may have comorbidities that complicate long-term treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017; Perl, 2016).

In summary, rapamycin’s well-established mechanism of mTORC1 inhibition combined with its capacity to restore autophagy provides a compelling rationale for repurposing it as a therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis. The extensive preclinical data supporting its effects on protein aggregate clearance, coupled with its known pharmacokinetic and safety profiles from other clinical settings, are major strengths that support further investigation. However, optimizing dosing to avoid potential adverse effects on muscle protein synthesis and regeneration is critical, and additional preclinical studies in IBM-specific models as well as well-designed clinical trials are needed to fully validate its efficacy and safety in this indication (Lin et al., 2022; Konopka et al., 2023; Stanfield et al., 2024). Given the significant unmet medical need in IBM and the promising mechanistic data, rapamycin represents a high-priority candidate for further development and clinical evaluation, albeit with a cautious approach to mitigating its immunosuppressive and potential myotoxic side effects (Selvarani et al., 2021; Joseph et al., 2019).

Overall, our evaluation concludes that rapamycin is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis. Its origins as a natural macrolide, well-characterized pharmacological history in other indications, clear molecular mechanism involving direct inhibition of mTORC1 via FKBP12 binding, and its documented ability to restore autophagic flux and clear misfolded protein aggregates collectively offer strong potential for addressing the proteostasis defects observed in IBM (Perl, 2016; Lilleker et al., 2019; Joseph et al., 2019). While challenges remain regarding dosing optimization, long-term safety, and balancing its dual roles in protein synthesis and degradation, the preclinical and emerging clinical evidence supports moving forward with targeted IBM studies, including patient-derived myotube assays and controlled clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022; Konopka et al., 2023). This comprehensive review validates the hypothesis that mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin may indeed restore autophagy, clear toxic protein aggregates, alleviate ER stress, and ultimately improve muscle contractility and organization in Inclusion Body Myositis, warranting its further development as a repurposed therapeutic candidate in this challenging neuromuscular disease (Lilleker et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2022; Han et al., 2022).
