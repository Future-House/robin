Proposal for MLN120B

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MLN120B is a synthetic small-molecule inhibitor that belongs to the IKKβ inhibitors class. It was developed through medicinal chemistry efforts involving optimization of inhibitor scaffolds—originating from a β‐carboline series—to yield a compound with potent and selective ATP‐competitive inhibition of IKKβ kinase activity (Dang, 2010; Karin, Yamamoto, & Wang, 2004). As an IKKβ inhibitor, MLN120B is designed to interfere with the catalytic domain of IKKβ, preventing phosphorylation of IκB proteins. This interruption stabilizes IκB, thereby sequestering NF-κB in the cytosol and preventing its nuclear translocation and subsequent transcription of inflammatory and catabolic genes. MLN120B’s synthetic origin implies that its structure and pharmacologic properties—such as oral bioavailability and adequate rodent pharmacokinetics—were optimized for targeting inflammatory pathways, which has been of interest in multiple inflammatory and neoplastic disease models (Llona-Minguez, Baiget, & Mackay, 2013; Prescott & Cook, 2018).

Therapeutic History:
IKKβ inhibitors as a drug class have a robust preclinical history, with compounds such as MLN120B being extensively validated in inflammatory disease models, cancer cell lines, and animal models of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple myeloma, and even lung inflammation. For example, preclinical studies demonstrated that MLN120B effectively blocks NF-κB activation in several in vitro models and animal models of inflammatory diseases—where inhibition of IKKβ leads to reduced proinflammatory cytokine production and minimized tissue destruction (Dang, 2010; Prescott & Cook, 2018). Despite these encouraging findings in inflammatory settings, MLN120B has not been formally evaluated in clinical trials for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). The literature search on ClinicalTrials.gov confirms that there is no clinical trial registered that uses MLN120B or selective IKKβ inhibitors directly for IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nevertheless, the documented anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic properties of this class provide an appealing rationale for repurposing such compounds for IBM, a disease marked by inflammatory myopathy and muscle degeneration (Creus, De Paepe, & De Bleecker, 2009; Rayavarapu et al., 2013).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of MLN120B is centered on its role as an ATP-competitive inhibitor of IKKβ. IKKβ is a catalytic subunit within the IκB kinase (IKK) complex that, upon activation by proinflammatory stimuli such as TNF-α, phosphorylates the inhibitory IκB proteins bound to NF-κB transcription factors. Phosphorylation marks IκB for ubiquitination and degradation, releasing NF-κB—predominantly in the form of p65/p50 heterodimers—to translocate into the nucleus and drive the transcription of proinflammatory, pro-survival, and muscle atrophy-related genes (Karin, 2006; Li, Malhotra, & Kumar, 2008). MLN120B, by competitively inhibiting the ATP binding site on IKKβ, prevents this phosphorylation event. This blockade results in a sustained association of IκB with NF-κB, thereby attenuating the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and reducing its transcriptional activity. Importantly, NF-κB activation is known to stimulate the expression of muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as MuRF-1 and Atrogin-1, which mediate proteasomal degradation and are central to muscle wasting processes (Li, Malhotra, & Kumar, 2008; Monici et al., 2003). Consequently, MLN120B is expected to suppress these downstream atrophy pathways by blocking the canonical NF-κB pathway. The molecular specificity of MLN120B has been compared with other IKKβ inhibitors such as BMS-345541 and IKK VII in muscle assays, and it has shown promising selectivity owing to its minimal off-target effects on other kinases (Dang, 2010; Karin, Yamamoto, & Wang, 2004).

Expected Effect:
Based on preclinical evidence in various inflammatory models and robust in vitro assays using muscle cells, the expected effect of MLN120B in the context of IBM is twofold. First, by inhibiting IKKβ, MLN120B should block the NF-κB–dependent transcription of key atrophy genes such as MuRF-1 and Atrogin-1. These ubiquitin ligases have been directly implicated in muscle protein degradation and the progression of muscle wasting in conditions like IBM (Li, Malhotra, & Kumar, 2008; Brunn et al., 2012). Studies using muscle-specific in vitro assays—such as those utilizing NF-κB-driven luciferase reporters in C2C12 myotubes—have shown that NF-κB inhibitors can inhibit nuclear translocation of NF-κB and rescue sarcomere integrity in differentiated muscle cells (Baudy et al., 2009). Second, by preventing the chronic, low-grade inflammation observed in IBM, MLN120B is expected to preserve contractile function by mitigating inflammatory cytokine production (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β) that otherwise exacerbates muscle degeneration (Belova et al., 2017; Creus, De Paepe, & De Bleecker, 2009). The overall hypothesis is that selective IKKβ inhibition in IBM myotubes will not only reduce the expression of atrophy markers but also maintain the overall muscle structure and contractile properties, likely resulting in improved muscle strength and function.

Overall Evaluation:
The rationale for repurposing MLN120B as a therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis is supported by several strengths, although there are key challenges to be addressed. One major strength is the well-defined mechanistic basis of MLN120B, which directly targets IKKβ, a central node in the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway responsible for mediating inflammatory responses and muscle atrophy (Karin, 2006; Li, Malhotra, & Kumar, 2008). The ATP-competitive mode of inhibition provides molecular specificity, which is critical in reducing unintended side effects. Preclinical studies in models of inflammatory diseases have shown robust anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic effects with IKKβ inhibitors, lending credence to the idea that these same mechanisms could be beneficial in IBM (Prescott & Cook, 2018; Dang, 2010). Moreover, in vitro data from muscle-specific assays demonstrate that NF-κB inhibition can rescue sarcomere integrity and prevent the upregulation of atrophy-associated ubiquitin ligases in myotubes (Baudy et al., 2009; Li, Malhotra, & Kumar, 2008).

On the other hand, there are several weaknesses and challenges that must be acknowledged. Despite promising preclinical efficacy in other inflammatory contexts, MLN120B has not yet been directly applied or clinically evaluated in the context of IBM. The absence of clinical or veterinary studies in IBM means that its efficacy in muscle-specific pathologies remains theoretical and will require extensive preclinical validation using muscle cell models and animal models that recapitulate the IBM phenotype (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while selective IKKβ inhibition is beneficial for blocking canonical NF-κB signaling, emerging evidence suggests that in certain contexts IKKβ inhibitors might induce compensatory activation of noncanonical NF-κB pathways or lead to paradoxical upregulation of some catabolic mediators (Belova et al., 2017; Hideshima et al., 2009). This raises the possibility that MLN120B’s effects on muscle cells might be more complex than simply inhibiting atrophy gene expression. There is also the inherent challenge of systemic immunomodulation: while suppressing NF-κB can ameliorate chronic inflammation, NF-κB also plays critical roles in cell survival and immune defense. Therefore, long-term systemic IKKβ inhibition could carry risks such as impaired host-defense mechanisms or adverse effects on muscle regeneration (Karin, Yamamoto, & Wang, 2004; Prescott & Cook, 2018).

Another potential weakness lies in the translational gap between rodent models and human muscle pathology. Although MLN120B has known rodent pharmacokinetics and efficacy in models of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple myeloma (Dang, 2010; Prescott & Cook, 2018), the translation of these effects to the muscle-specific pathology of IBM—characterized by chronic inflammation, protein aggregation, and degenerative myopathy—remains untested. The cellular environment in IBM muscle, including the interplay between inflammatory infiltrates and myotubes, is highly complex, and it remains to be determined if MLN120B’s inhibition of NF-κB will be sufficient to preserve contractile function over the long term in this context (Creus, De Paepe, & De Bleecker, 2009; Li, Malhotra, & Kumar, 2008).

In summary, MLN120B stands as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in Inclusion Body Myositis due to its potent and selective IKKβ inhibition, which directly targets a key driver of NF-κB activation implicated in muscle atrophy and inflammatory signaling. Its established anti-inflammatory efficacy in preclinical models of arthritis and cancer, alongside its favorable rodent pharmacokinetics, supports the hypothesis that MLN120B could block NF-κB–mediated transcription of atrophy genes in IBM myotubes, thereby preventing the upregulation of MuRF-1 and Atrogin-1 and preserving contractile function (Karin, 2006; Li, Malhotra, & Kumar, 2008; Prescott & Cook, 2018). However, significant challenges remain, including the need for dedicated muscle-specific preclinical studies, assessment of potential compensatory pathways, and careful consideration of safety and immune function. Overall, while the mechanistic rationale and preclinical data are encouraging, further targeted studies are required to validate MLN120B’s efficacy and safety in IBM before it can be advanced as a clinical candidate for this debilitating muscle disease (Baudy et al., 2009; Creus, De Paepe, & De Bleecker, 2009).
