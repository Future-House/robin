Proposal for Pexidartinib

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pexidartinib (marketed as Turalio®) is an orally bioavailable, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively targets the colony‐stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). It was originally discovered and developed through synthetic medicinal chemistry programs aimed at identifying inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases involved in the survival and proliferation of macrophages. As a synthetic small molecule belonging to the kinase inhibitor class, pexidartinib was first optimized for its potent inhibition of CSF1R with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the low nanomolar range (approximately 17 nM), as well as for its favorable pharmacokinetic profile that supports twice‐daily dosing on an empty stomach. CSF1R, a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed predominantly on monocytes and tissue macrophages, drives pathways central to macrophage differentiation, survival, and proliferation. The therapeutic targeting of CSF1R has primarily been exploited for conditions in which pathological macrophage expansion is a key etiological factor, such as in tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT), where overexpression of its ligand CSF1 generates an inflammatory and proliferative milieu. Moreover, this class of compounds is well known for its application in oncology settings, where modulation of the tumor microenvironment through macrophage depletion may enhance antitumor immune responses (Unknown Reference).

Therapeutic History:
Pexidartinib has a robust development history culminating in its FDA-approval for the treatment of TGCT, a disorder characterized by excessive recruitment and proliferation of CSF1R-dependent macrophages that drive tumor growth and joint morbidity. Clinical studies, notably a Phase 3 study (ENLIVEN), demonstrated that pexidartinib led to significant tumor shrinkage and improvements in range of motion, with a manageable safety profile despite concerns regarding hepatotoxicity necessitating close liver function monitoring (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Unknown Reference). In addition to TGCT, several early-phase clinical trials have evaluated pexidartinib in various oncologic settings, including advanced solid tumors and relapsed leukemias, largely focusing on its ability to deplete tumor-associated macrophages, modulate the immune microenvironment, and synergize with standard cytotoxic chemotherapies (Boal et al., 2020; Wesolowski et al., 2019). Despite extensive testing in oncology and inflammatory conditions such as tenosynovial giant cell tumor, there are no published clinical studies directly addressing the use of pexidartinib in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) or other primary inflammatory myopathies. Nonetheless, the rationale for repurposing this drug in IBM is supported indirectly by preclinical models in other inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, such as arthritis and skeletal muscle fibrosis, in which CSF1R inhibition has been associated with reduced inflammatory cytokine production and improved tissue function (Tseng et al., 2021; Stepien et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanistic basis of pexidartinib is centered on its potent inhibition of CSF1R, a receptor whose activation is critical for the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of macrophages. Pexidartinib binds to the juxtamembrane domain of CSF1R, locking the receptor in an auto-inhibited conformation and thereby preventing both the binding of its ligands—colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) and interleukin-34 (IL-34)—and subsequent ATP-dependent receptor auto-phosphorylation. This blockade halts the downstream signaling cascades such as the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways that are essential for macrophage survival and proliferation (Unknown Reference). By effectively depleting or of altering the function of macrophages, which are pivotal in driving inflammatory responses through the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNFα and IL-1β, pexidartinib can modulate the inflammatory milieu in affected tissues. In oncologic and fibrotic contexts, the inhibition of CSF1R-mediated pathways results in the depletion of immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic macrophages, thereby reducing inflammatory cytokine production and altering tissue homeostasis. This molecular mechanism has also been indirectly linked to improvements in tissue proteostasis and function in preclinical models; for instance, in models of skeletal muscle fibrosis and arthritis, targeting macrophage populations resulted in both reduced cytokine production and improved functional outcomes (Stepien et al., 2020; Tseng et al., 2021). From a biochemical perspective, the drug’s kinase-inhibiting activity is highly selective, diminishing off-target effects and providing a rationale for its repurposing in diseases where a reduction in macrophage-mediated inflammation is desirable.

Expected Effect in Inclusion Body Myositis:
Inclusion Body Myositis is characterized by chronic muscle inflammation, progressive muscle degeneration, and impaired muscle proteostasis that ultimately leads to contractile dysfunction. A significant pathological feature of IBM is the substantial infiltration of pro-inflammatory macrophages into muscle tissue, where these cells release cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β that exacerbate muscle fiber damage and contribute to a proteotoxic environment. The hypothesis underlying the use of pexidartinib in IBM is that its CSF1R inhibition will lead to a marked reduction in the population of these deleterious macrophages, thereby decreasing the local secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This reduction in TNFα and IL-1β is expected to alleviate secondary proteostatic stress on muscle fibers, in turn preserving or even improving the contractile properties of myotubes. Preclinical data from studies in inflammatory muscle conditions and fibrotic models suggest that modulation of macrophage populations—with consequent reductions in cytokine-driven inflammation—can lead to improvements in tissue remodeling and functional recovery (Boal et al., 2020; Tseng et al., 2021). In an ideal in vitro assay using patient-derived myotubes, one would expect to observe a decline in cytokine markers upon treatment with pexidartinib, improved markers of proteostasis (e.g., reduced misfolded protein aggregates), and enhanced contractile function due to diminished inflammatory signaling. Moreover, RNA-sequencing studies of IBM muscle tissues have revealed distinct inflammatory cytokine signatures dominated by type 1 inflammation and overexpression of chemokine axes (e.g., CCL5-CCR5) that may also be indirectly modulated by altering macrophage infiltration (Kirou et al., 2025). Therefore, the expected effect of pexidartinib in IBM would be to shift the muscle microenvironment from a chronic inflammatory and proteotoxic state toward a milieu more conducive to muscle repair and functional maintenance.

Overall Evaluation:
Pexidartinib presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis based on several scientific rationales. Its established safety and efficacy in TGCT have provided a wealth of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, including reliable markers of target engagement such as the depletion of CD14dim/CD16+ monocyte subsets and increased plasma CSF1 levels (Wesolowski et al., 2019; Unknown Reference). The drug’s mechanism of action, rooted in the selective inhibition of CSF1R, offers a plausible therapeutic pathway for reducing pathological macrophage infiltration in IBM muscle tissue—a key contributor to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines responsible for muscle damage and impaired proteostasis. Strengths of this therapeutic candidate include its high selectivity for CSF1R, oral bioavailability, and extensive clinical experience in a related macrophage-driven disease (Unknown Reference).

However, several weaknesses and uncertainties remain. Despite the strong mechanistic rationale, there is currently a lack of direct clinical data or preclinical studies evaluating pexidartinib in IBM specifically; all evidence is extrapolated from oncology and fibrotic disease models (Clinical Trial Search: (Pexidartinib OR CSF1R inhibitor) AND (inclusion body myositis OR IBM OR muscle inflammation OR muscle disease), Kirou et al., 2025). The translation of macrophage depletion effects from tumors or fibrotic tissues to skeletal muscle may encounter unique challenges, such as potential off-target effects on muscle regeneration or unintended consequences on muscle repair mechanisms. Moreover, pexidartinib is associated with hepatotoxicity concerns, and its long-term safety profile in a chronic, non-malignant condition such as IBM requires careful evaluation (Gelderblom & van de Sande, 2020). Another potential limitation is that while CSF1R inhibition may reduce macrophage numbers and cytokine production, IBM is a multifactorial disease with complex immunopathological processes, and macrophage-mediated inflammation is only one component of its pathophysiology. Thus, pexidartinib may need to be combined with other therapeutic strategies to achieve clinically meaningful improvement in muscle contractility and overall function.

In summary, pexidartinib holds significant promise as a repurposed therapy for IBM due to its well-characterized mechanism of CSF1R inhibition, established clinical use in TGCT, and supportive preclinical data from related inflammatory and fibrotic conditions. The expected outcome from its application in IBM would be a reduction in pro-inflammatory macrophages within muscle tissue, decreased secretion of cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β, improvement in proteostatic balance, and enhanced muscle contractility. However, further targeted preclinical studies in relevant IBM models and early-phase clinical evaluations in IBM patients are necessary to validate this approach, optimize dosing regimens, and fully assess the risk-to-benefit profile in the context of a chronic inflammatory myopathy. The overall strengths lie in the drug’s mechanistic specificity and prior safety data in other indications, while the key weaknesses concern the lack of direct evidence in muscle disease and potential adverse effects that might limit its long-term use in a non-malignant disorder (Boal et al., 2020; Wesolowski et al., 2019).
