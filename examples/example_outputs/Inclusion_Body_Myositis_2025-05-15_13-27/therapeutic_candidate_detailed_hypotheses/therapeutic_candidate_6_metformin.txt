Proposal for Metformin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Metformin is a well‐established synthetic biguanide originally derived from French lilac (Galega officinalis), and it has been used clinically for decades in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. As a member of the biguanide class, its discovery was based on its glucose‐lowering effects, which are primarily mediated via inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis and enhancement of peripheral insulin sensitivity. Owing to its widespread use and favorable safety profile, metformin is one of the most commonly prescribed anti‐diabetic agents worldwide. Importantly, its known oral bioavailability, predictable pharmacokinetics, and extensive safety data in human populations make it an attractive candidate for repurposing in other disorders. This proposal builds on the concept that metformin’s pharmacological actions extend beyond glycemic control into cellular energy regulation, particularly through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The candidate thus falls into the class of metabolic modulators that are now being evaluated for applications in conditions characterized by proteostatic and mitochondrial dysfunction, such as Inclusion Body Myositis (Amin et al., 2019, pp. 1–5; Witham et al., 2023, pp. 4–5).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, metformin has been utilized primarily in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, where its benefits include improved glycemic control and reduced insulin resistance. Beyond its metabolic role, extensive biochemical and clinical studies have demonstrated metformin’s capacity to modulate key intracellular signaling pathways, including the activation of AMPK and the downstream inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). These actions have sparked interest in repurposing metformin for conditions such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and various muscle-wasting conditions. Preclinical studies in dystrophic muscle models, such as mdx mice, and in aged muscle have shown that metformin can restore autophagy, improve mitochondrial function, and, in some cases, enhance muscle contractility (Amin et al., 2019, pp. 18–21; Shang & Miao, 2023, pp. 9–10). However, searches specifically targeting clinical trials for metformin in IBM (e.g., “Clinical Trial Search: Metformin AND Inclusion Body Myositis”) have thus far returned no registered studies, indicating that direct testing in IBM has not yet been undertaken (ClinicalTrials.gov). Despite the absence of clinical trials in IBM, related studies in sarcopenia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and other inflammatory myopathies provide preliminary mechanistic support for metformin’s potential utility in diseases that share features with IBM, such as impaired autophagy and mitochondrial abnormalities (Witham et al., 2023, pp. 4–5; Chen et al., 2022, pp. 7–9).

Mechanism of Action:
Metformin’s primary molecular mechanism involves the inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, a process that leads to an increase in the cellular AMP:ATP ratio and subsequent activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Amin et al., 2019, pp. 5–8; Shang & Miao, 2023, pp. 1–2). Once activated, AMPK functions as a metabolic master regulator and exerts multiple downstream effects. One critical pathway involves the inhibition of mTORC1, a central regulator of protein synthesis and cell growth. In various muscle models, this inhibition is associated with the stimulation of autophagy – a cellular process for degrading misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, which is often impaired in IBM (Amin et al., 2019, pp. 18–21; Shang & Miao, 2023, pp. 11–12). In addition, AMPK activation leads to the upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), thereby promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and enhancing overall mitochondrial function (Shang & Miao, 2023, pp. 9–10; Witham et al., 2023, pp. 4–5). These actions are mechanistically attractive because IBM is characterized by intracellular protein aggregates, aberrant autophagy, and mitochondrial dysfunction within muscle fibers. Notably, however, certain studies have shown that metformin might increase myostatin expression in muscle tissue via an AMPK-FoxO3a-HDAC6 axis, potentially contributing to muscle atrophy rather than muscle preservation (Kang et al., 2022, pp. 5–7). This highlights the complexity of metformin’s action in skeletal muscle, where context-dependent responses might vary according to metabolic conditions and disease models. Other investigations, for example in C2C12 myoblasts, have detailed metformin’s ability to regulate differentiation and cellular metabolism through AMPK activation, further supporting the rationale for its use in conditions of muscle degeneration (Maniscalco et al., 2023, pp. 13–15).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, activation of AMPK in IBM myotubes by metformin is expected to inhibit mTORC1, which should relieve the inhibitory effects on autophagy and thereby promote the clearance of deleterious protein aggregates. IBM is typically characterized by cellular inclusions and impaired proteostasis; thus, enhancing autophagic flux could directly mitigate aggregate accumulation. Additionally, the promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1α activation would normalize mitochondrial dynamics, thereby improving muscle fiber bioenergetics and contractile kinetics. This expected outcome is supported by animal studies where metformin treatment in aged muscle and dystrophic models led to improvements in mitochondrial function and muscle regeneration (Shang & Miao, 2023, pp. 11–12; Witham et al., 2023, pp. 13–14). In vitro studies on C2C12 myotubes have evidenced that metformin treatment modulates morphological parameters such as myotube diameter and fusion index via AMPK-dependent mechanisms (Maniscalco et al., 2023, pp. 13–15). The beneficial modifications in signal transduction pathways, including the downregulation of atrophy-related genes and normalization of mitochondrial respiration, are anticipated to translate into improvements in muscle strength and increased resistance to degeneration in IBM myotubes. It is important to highlight that metformin’s known pharmacodynamic activity in muscle tissue is consistent with the proposed hypothesis, given that the AMPK-mTORC1 axis is a well-established regulator of cellular proteostasis and mitochondrial quality control (Chen et al., 2022, p. 17; Dungan et al., 2016, pp. 1–2).

Overall Evaluation:
Metformin presents a compelling profile as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis due to several strengths. First, its robust safety record over decades of use in type 2 diabetes and the extensive human pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data support its feasibility in clinical application. Its oral administration, widespread availability, and generic status further enhance its appeal from a drug development perspective (Amin et al., 2019, pp. 1–5; Witham et al., 2023, pp. 4–5). Second, the mechanistic rationale is solid: metformin’s activation of AMPK, subsequent inhibition of mTORC1, and stimulation of autophagy are all pathways that are centrally implicated in the pathogenesis of IBM through impaired protein clearance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic muscle degeneration (Shang & Miao, 2023, pp. 1–2; Chen et al., 2022, pp. 7–9). Positive preclinical findings in models of dystrophy and sarcopenia further reinforce the hypothesis that similar molecular benefits could be extended to IBM. Third, the candidate demonstrates beneficial effects on mitochondrial biogenesis via upregulation of PGC-1α and normalization of energy homeostasis, which could help restore contractile kinetics and muscle regeneration (Shang & Miao, 2023, pp. 9–10; Witham et al., 2023, pp. 13–14).

Nevertheless, significant weaknesses and challenges must be acknowledged. Some studies have reported that metformin can induce muscle atrophy in non-diabetic models by upregulating myostatin through an AMPK-dependent mechanism, potentially counteracting benefits by exacerbating muscle wasting under certain conditions (Kang et al., 2022, pp. 5–7). This dichotomous effect highlights that the response to metformin is context-dependent and may vary with the underlying metabolic and pathological state of the muscle tissue. Moreover, while there is a robust body of literature supporting metformin’s benefits in models of dystrophy and age-associated muscle decline, direct evidence in IBM—an inflammatory myopathy with unique pathophysiological features such as rimmed vacuoles and specific inflammatory infiltrates—remains sparse. Specifically, searches have not revealed any clinical trials or preclinical studies tailored to IBM, indicating a gap between the mechanistic hypothesis and direct validation in IBM models (ClinicalTrials.gov). Lastly, while the candidate’s anti-inflammatory and mitochondrial protective effects are promising, the potential for metformin to alter muscle protein synthesis in ways that might be detrimental over the long term (e.g., by inhibiting mTORC1 excessively) calls for rigorous dose-ranging and mechanistic optimization studies before clinical translation.

In summary, metformin has a strong translational potential as a repurposed therapeutic for Inclusion Body Myositis based on its capacity to modulate the AMPK-mTORC1 axis, stimulate autophagy, and ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction—all of which are central to IBM pathology. Its benefits observed in muscle regeneration and preservation in other preclinical models lend credence to the hypothesis that it could mitigate the proteostatic defects and contractile deficits in IBM myotubes. However, the possibility of context-dependent adverse effects such as the induction of myostatin and consequent muscle atrophy, as well as the lack of direct evidence in IBM models, represent significant caveats. Further preclinical studies, particularly those employing IBM-relevant models and detailed mechanistic evaluations, are warranted to conclusively determine whether metformin’s benefits can be harnessed safely and effectively in this challenging muscle disease (Amin et al., 2019, pp. 18–21; Shang & Miao, 2023, pp. 9–10; Kang et al., 2022, pp. 5–7). Overall, while metformin exhibits several strengths as a candidate drug due to its safety profile and mechanistic plausibility, careful consideration of dosing and context-specific muscular responses will be critical to its successful repurposing for IBM (Maniscalco et al., 2023, pp. 13–15; Dungan et al., 2016, pp. 10–11).
