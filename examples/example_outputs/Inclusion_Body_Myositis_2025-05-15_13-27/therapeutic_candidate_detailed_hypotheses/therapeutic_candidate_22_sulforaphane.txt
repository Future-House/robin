Proposal for Sulforaphane

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sulforaphane (SFN) is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate that is bioactive and derived from cruciferous vegetables, with broccoli, broccoli sprouts, cabbage, and kale being the primary sources. It is formed from the glucosinolate precursor glucoraphanin through the enzymatic activity of myrosinase, which exists in plant tissues and in the human gut microbiome. This compound belongs to the broader class of phytochemicals known as isothiocyanates, which have long been associated with chemopreventive and antioxidant activities. Historically, SFN was first characterized for its anticancer properties, as epidemiological studies supported an inverse correlation between the consumption of cruciferous vegetables and cancer incidence. Accordingly, SFN has been developed as a nutraceutical and is widely recognized for its ability to stimulate cellular defense mechanisms through the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. The interest in SFN has grown in the context of repurposing existing compounds with known safety profiles for new therapeutic indications; its natural occurrence, low toxicity at dietary doses, and oral bioavailability make it a promising candidate for a repurposing strategy. The class of compounds that SFN represents has been extensively used in both preventive nutritional strategies and as a component in preclinical studies targeting diseases characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation (Liebman & Le, 2021; Cardozo et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Sulforaphane’s therapeutic history spans numerous preclinical studies that have leveraged its capacity to induce phase II detoxification enzymes and enhance antioxidant responses. In cancer chemoprevention, SFN has shown common benefits by upregulating detoxification and antioxidant enzymes via Nrf2 activation, thus reducing the risk of various carcinogen-induced processes. Beyond oncology, SFN has also been implicated in neuroprotective strategies, improving mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress in models of neurodegeneration such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. Preclinical models in muscle biology have demonstrated that SFN can alleviate muscular dystrophy‐related pathologies by reducing oxidative stress and upregulating Nrf2-dependent gene expression. For example, studies in dystrophic muscle models reveal that SFN administration can reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, improve proteostasis, and enhance muscle function, suggesting that its mechanisms extend beyond cancer and into the realm of muscle disorders. Although direct clinical trials on Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) using SFN are lacking—as confirmed by several searches on ClinicalTrials.gov—the broad preclinical evidence in muscle atrophy and other protein aggregation diseases (such as seen in models of exercise-induced muscle damage and age-associated muscle dysfunction) supports the hypothesis that SFN might prove beneficial for IBM. SFN’s long record in both nutritional intervention and experimental medicine, combined with its history of safe use in human dietary studies, provides a strong basis for considering it for repurposing in IBM, a disease that shares mechanistic features with other muscle pathologies where SFN has already demonstrated efficacy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Bose et al., 2020; Ruhee & Suzuki, 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of SFN is its potent activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is bound in the cytosol by its inhibitory partner Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1), which facilitates its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. SFN acts as an electrophile that covalently modifies specific reactive cysteine residues on Keap1, particularly Cys-151 among other critical sites, thereby disrupting the Keap1-Nrf2 complex. This modification prevents the degradation of Nrf2, permitting its stabilization and subsequent nuclear translocation. Once within the nucleus, Nrf2 binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. This leads to the upregulation of a suite of cytoprotective genes, including phase II detoxification enzymes such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis. These enzymes collectively bolster the cell’s antioxidant capacity, reduce the burden of reactive oxygen species, and facilitate the restoration of redox homeostasis. Additionally, SFN has been shown to promote proteostasis by enhancing the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagic clearance mechanisms through the upregulation of heat shock proteins such as Hsp27. Upregulation of proteasome activity is particularly important in the context of pathologies that feature the accumulation of misfolded or aggregated proteins, as it ensures that damaged proteins are efficiently degraded and removed from the cell. In muscle models, where oxidative stress can promote protein aggregation and impair contractility, such proteostatic mechanisms are essential for maintaining muscle cell health. At the molecular level, SFN’s actions extend further by modulating additional signaling pathways including AMPK, Akt/Foxo, and mTOR, which are involved in cellular metabolism, growth, and autophagy regulation. Taken together, the biochemical interactions of SFN—its covalent modification of Keap1, subsequent activation of Nrf2, induction of antioxidant and proteostasis-related genes, and secondary effects on metabolic pathways—provide a comprehensive mechanistic rationale for its use in diseases characterized by oxidative stress and protein aggregation, such as IBM (Ruhee et al., 2025; Bose et al., 2020; Cardozo et al., 2021; Ruhee & Suzuki, 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed experimental assay using IBM myotubes, the expectation is that SFN will activate Nrf2 and drive the expression of its downstream target genes involved in antioxidant defense and proteostasis. Activation of Nrf2 will lead to increased transcription and subsequent translation of detoxifying enzymes such as NQO1, HO-1, and glutathione-related enzymes, which together will enhance the muscle cell’s capacity to neutralize excess ROS. This reduction in oxidative stress is critical because oxidative damage is known to potentiate the formation of protein aggregates—a hallmark of IBM pathology. By mitigating oxidative stress, SFN is expected to decrease the formation and accumulation of such aggregates within muscle fibers, thereby alleviating one of the central disease mechanisms in IBM. Moreover, in muscle atrophy models, SFN has been observed to promote improvements in muscle fiber integrity and contractile performance. The enhancement of contractile performance is hypothesized to result not only from the reduction in toxic aggregate burden but also from improved mitochondrial function and energy metabolism as a result of reduced oxidative damage. In addition, SFN-induced upregulation of proteasome activity and autophagy, as evidenced by increased expression of chaperones like Hsp27, is anticipated to facilitate the clearance of misfolded proteins. This proteostatic boost is particularly significant in IBM, where impaired protein turnover directly contributes to muscle weakness and degeneration. Therefore, in IBM myotubes, SFN is predicted to enhance overall cellular protein quality control, promote a healthier redox state, and ultimately improve the contractile properties and viability of muscle cells. This multi-pronged effect—centered on antioxidant upregulation, improved proteostasis, and better mitochondrial function—aligns closely with the hypothesis that SFN’s Nrf2-mediated actions can counteract the pathological features of IBM (Alattar et al., 2022; Bose et al., 2020; Ruhee & Suzuki, 2020; Zhang et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Sulforaphane emerges as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis through its multifaceted actions on the Nrf2 pathway. One of the major strengths of SFN is its well-documented ability to boost cellular antioxidant defenses by directly modifying Keap1, thus ensuring the activation and stabilization of Nrf2. This, in turn, leads to the upregulation of a broad array of cytoprotective genes, resulting in enhanced detoxification, improved redox balance, and stimulated proteostasis. Readers should note that the same mechanisms that protect against carcinogenesis in nutritional models have now been observed in muscle atrophy and oxidative stress environments; this cross-tissue applicability underscores the therapeutic versatility of SFN. Another strength is the excellent human safety profile and oral bioavailability of SFN, which has been confirmed in numerous dietary studies and clinical evaluations in other conditions. These attributes facilitate easier translation from preclinical findings to clinical applications, reducing the time and cost typically associated with early-phase drug development. Furthermore, the capacity of SFN to modulate secondary signaling pathways such as AMPK, Akt/Foxo, and mTOR provides additional rationale for its beneficial effects on muscle metabolism and contractile performance. It is anticipated that by reducing ROS-mediated damage and promoting efficient proteostatic clearance, SFN can reduce the formation of toxic protein aggregates—a key pathogenic feature in IBM—thereby preserving muscle function and potentially improving clinical outcomes.

However, there are also potential challenges and weaknesses in deploying SFN as a therapeutic for IBM. Despite robust preclinical evidence, direct clinical data supporting the use of SFN in IBM are sparse. Although several searches on ClinicalTrials.gov indicate that no clinical trials have been registered directly linking SFN with IBM, the absence of such data necessitates careful validation in preclinical IBM models before moving to human studies. Moreover, while SFN has been shown to be effective in reducing oxidative stress and improving muscle function in models of muscular dystrophy and age-related muscle dysfunction, IBM presents a complex pathophysiological landscape involving not only oxidative stress and aggregation but also profound inflammatory and immune-mediated components. Thus, while SFN’s antioxidant and proteostatic mechanisms may address part of the disease process, they may not fully target the immunological aspects of IBM pathology, which might require combination therapies. Another concern is related to the potential for sustained Nrf2 activation to become maladaptive over chronic treatment courses. Although acute and intermittent activation of Nrf2 is beneficial, there are reports in other tissues of potential reductive stress or even paradoxical adverse effects when Nrf2 is overactivated continuously. Therefore, careful dosing, monitoring, and possibly intermittent dosing regimens of SFN would be necessary in a clinical context to avoid such complications. Finally, while SFN’s natural origin is an advantage in terms of safety and public acceptance, its pharmacokinetic variability, influenced by factors such as dietary preparation and individual differences in gut microbiota activity, could potentially lead to inconsistent therapeutic levels among patients.

Overall, sulforaphane represents a strong candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent in IBM. Its mechanism of activating Nrf2 through Keap1 cysteine modification leads to a cascade of cytoprotective, proteostatic, and anti-inflammatory effects that are highly relevant to the pathogenesis of IBM. Preclinical data in muscle models of oxidative stress and atrophy support the hypothesis that SFN could reduce aggregate formation and improve muscle contractile performance. However, rigorous preclinical studies using dedicated IBM models are needed to validate these findings and to determine optimal dosing regimens. In parallel, early-phase clinical trials would be crucial to assess SFN’s efficacy and safety specifically in IBM patients. Given its natural origin, established safety profile, and multifaceted pharmacodynamics, SFN offers a compelling multi-targeted approach to bolster endogenous antioxidative and proteostatic defenses in IBM, although it may need to be combined with other agents to address the full spectrum of the disease’s pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Bose et al., 2020; Cardozo et al., 2021; Ruhee & Suzuki, 2020; Ruhee et al., 2025; Liebman & Le, 2021).

In conclusion, evaluating the candidate sulforaphane brings forth a persuasive scientific rationale based on its natural origin, mechanism of action via Nrf2 activation, and historical use in models of oxidative stress and muscle dysfunction. Its ability to improve cellular antioxidant defenses, enhance proteasome activity, and stimulate autophagy holds significant promise for addressing the key pathogenic features of Inclusion Body Myositis—namely oxidative stress–driven protein aggregation and compromised muscle function. While current clinical evidence in IBM is limited, preclinical studies in related muscle and aging models provide encouraging data. The next steps in validating SFN for IBM should include comprehensive preclinical investigations using IBM-specific cellular and animal models, followed by carefully designed clinical trials to establish efficacy and safety in human patients. With these additional studies, sulforaphane could become a vital component of a novel therapeutic strategy that leverages endogenous cellular defense mechanisms to counteract the degenerative processes seen in IBM (Alattar et al., 2022; Ruhee & Suzuki, 2020; Bose et al., 2020; Cardozo et al., 2021).
