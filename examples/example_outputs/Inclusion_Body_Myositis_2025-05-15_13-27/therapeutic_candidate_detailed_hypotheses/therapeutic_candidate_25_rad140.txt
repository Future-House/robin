Proposal for RAD140 (Testolone)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
RAD140, also known as Testolone, is a nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) originally discovered through extensive medicinal chemistry campaigns aimed at identifying compounds with potent anabolic activity and improved tissue selectivity compared to traditional anabolic steroids (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 1–3). Unlike natural androgens such as testosterone, which have widespread effects on multiple tissues and are associated with adverse side effects like prostate hypertrophy and cardiovascular issues, RAD140 belongs to the SARM class, which has been synthetically engineered to preferentially bind to androgen receptors (ARs) in skeletal muscle and bone while sparing tissues such as the prostate (Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 1–3; Budaya et al., 2024, pp. 1–2). The synthesis of RAD140 involved optimizing its chemical structure for high binding affinity (Ki ≈ 7 nM) and metabolic stability, as well as achieving good oral bioavailability as demonstrated in preclinical animal models, including studies in rats and nonhuman primates (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 3–5). SARMs as a class have historically been investigated for applications in muscle wasting, osteoporosis, and cachexia due to their ability to stimulate anabolic processes in muscle and bone via selective AR activation (Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 15–16; Budaya et al., 2024, pp. 2–4). This candidate’s synthetic origins and engineered selectivity underscore its potential as a repurposed therapeutic agent for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), where the goal is to stimulate anabolic pathways in myotubes with minimal systemic androgenic side effects (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 1–3; Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 16–21).

Therapeutic History:
Over the past decade, compounds in the SARM category have undergone extensive preclinical evaluation and entered early‐phase clinical trials for various indications, such as muscle wasting associated with cancer cachexia, age‐related sarcopenia, and hypogonadism (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). RAD140 in particular has been evaluated in preclinical studies demonstrating significant anabolic activity on muscle tissue, including increased muscle mass and improved muscle fiber characteristics in rodent models, where it produced dose‐dependent increases in levator ani muscle weight with minimal androgenic stimulation of the prostate (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 5–6; Budaya et al., 2024, pp. 1–2). Although direct clinical data on RAD140’s effects in patients with Inclusion Body Myositis has not yet been reported, its ongoing Phase I trials in contexts such as cancer‐related muscle wasting, as well as its investigation under protocols registered (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017), suggest a growing body of evidence supporting its anabolic potential (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017). Historical evidence from other SARMs, which have demonstrated improvements in lean body mass, also serves to support RAD140’s therapeutic promise (Bhasin et al., 2023, pp. 1–2). Notably, while testosterone replacement therapies have been used in muscle wasting conditions, their undesirable side effects have driven the pursuit of SARMs like RAD140 which reduce the risk of androgenic adverse effects in tissues not targeted for anabolic effects (Dalton et al., 2014, pp. 1–2). Although RAD140 itself has not been extensively tested specifically for IBM, its preclinical profile in models of muscle atrophy and its favorable tissue selectivity suggest that it could be repurposed for IBM provided that further clinical development is undertaken (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 1–3; Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 16–21).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism by which RAD140 exerts its effects centers on its selective modulation of the androgen receptor. After oral administration, RAD140 is absorbed and circulates systemically, where it preferentially binds to androgen receptors expressed in skeletal muscle—promoting the recruitment of co‐activators necessary for the transcription of genes involved in muscle protein synthesis and cell growth, while exhibiting minimal activation in tissues such as the prostate (Miller et al., 2011, p. 6; Budaya et al., 2024, pp. 4–5). At the molecular level, RAD140 binds to the ligand‐binding domain (LBD) of the androgen receptor, inducing a conformational change that favors the recruitment of anabolic coactivators over corepressors, thereby triggering downstream signaling cascades such as the Akt/mTOR pathway that leads to myotube hypertrophy (Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 3–4; Miller et al., 2011, pp. 5–6). These anabolic effects are underscored by increased transcription of muscle‐specific genes that are pivotal in muscle fiber growth, enhanced contractility, and improved protein synthesis, while simultaneously avoiding conversion by 5α‐reductase into more potent androgenic metabolites—a major limitation of traditional testosterone therapy (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 1–3; Budaya et al., 2024, pp. 1–2). Furthermore, biochemical studies have demonstrated that RAD140’s binding profile results in a favorable anabolic to androgenic activity ratio, meaning that it robustly increases muscle mass without inducing typical androgenic side effects like prostate enlargement or virilization (Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 16–21; Ladna et al., 2023, pp. 1–2). This selective signaling involves not only the classical genomic activation via direct DNA binding but may also engage non‐genomic pathways that contribute to rapid signaling events within muscle cells, further potentiating anabolic responses (Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 6–8; Miller et al., 2011, pp. 5–6). Detailed preclinical assessments indicate that RAD140 significantly improves muscle fiber cross‐sectional area and overall muscle mass in animal models, results which are consistent with its hypothesized mechanism in promoting beneficial adaptations in muscle tissue (Puskas, 2022, pp. 7–11, 29–35).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the repurposing of RAD140 for the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis is that selective androgen receptor modulation will lead to enhanced anabolic signaling in IBM myotubes, thereby increasing muscle protein synthesis, improving muscle fiber size, and enhancing contractile function without the undesirable androgenic side effects typically associated with steroids. In cellular assays and preclinical models of muscle wasting, RAD140 is expected to stimulate pathways that are crucial for muscle hypertrophy by upregulating the transcription of specific myogenic genes and promoting the synthesis of contractile proteins (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 3–4; Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 15–16). In particular, the activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling cascade by RAD140 is anticipated to shift the balance of protein synthesis versus degradation in favor of anabolism, which is critical in reversing the muscle atrophy observed in IBM (Puskas, 2022, pp. 11–15; Bhasin et al., 2023, p. 7). Given that muscle fiber hypertrophy, especially of type I and type II fibers, is a key determinant of improved contractile strength and functional mobility in muscle wasting conditions, the anabolic effects induced by RAD140 could lead to clinically meaningful improvements in muscle performance in IBM patients (Feike et al., 2021, pp. 1–2; Miller et al., 2011, p. 6). Additionally, the fact that RAD140 does not undergo metabolic conversion into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or estradiol reduces the likelihood of provoking side effects such as prostate enlargement or gynecomastia, which supports its use in patient populations where such adverse effects are a major concern (Budaya et al., 2024, pp. 1–2; Dalton et al., 2014, pp. 1–2). Consequently, in the proposed assays using IBM patient‐derived myotubes, we expect RAD140 to enhance myogenic differentiation, improve cellular protein content, augment fiber cross‐sectional area, and ultimately lead to increased contractile force, thereby potentially ameliorating the progressive muscle weakness seen in IBM (Puskas, 2022, pp. 35–46; Bhasin et al., 2023, pp. 4–5). It is important to note, however, that while the anabolic potential of RAD140 is well supported by preclinical data, IBM is a complex disease with inflammatory and degenerative components that may not be fully addressed solely by anabolic stimulation (Tseng et al., 2018, pp. 15–18; Feike et al., 2021, pp. 10–11).

Overall Evaluation:
RAD140 (Testolone) presents a promising therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis due to its potent anabolic properties, tissue selectivity, and favorable pharmacokinetic profile. One of the primary strengths of RAD140 is its ability to selectively activate androgen receptors in muscle tissue, thereby promoting muscle hypertrophy and increasing protein synthesis without eliciting significant androgenic stimulation in tissues such as the prostate (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 1–3; Budaya et al., 2024, pp. 1–2). Its synthetic design, which includes modifications to enhance oral bioavailability and stability, makes it a practical candidate for chronic administration in populations suffering from muscle wasting disorders (Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 1–3; Miller et al., 2011, pp. 3–4). Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated that RAD140 increases muscle mass and improves muscle fiber characteristics in animal models, which supports the rationale that similar anabolic effects could be translated into improvements in muscle strength and function in IBM patients (Puskas, 2022, pp. 56–59; Miller et al., 2011, pp. 5–6). The expected mechanism—selective modulation of the androgen receptor leading to enhanced muscle protein synthesis via Akt/mTOR and other signaling cascades—is well characterized and provides a solid biochemical foundation for its repurposing in IBM (Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 16–21; Miller et al., 2011, p. 6).

Despite these strengths, several weaknesses and challenges should be acknowledged. First, while RAD140 has been extensively evaluated in preclinical settings and early‐phase clinical trials related to cancer cachexia and other muscle wasting conditions, there is limited direct clinical evidence regarding its efficacy in IBM specifically (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017). IBM is a complex inflammatory myopathy where muscle degeneration is not solely due to anabolic insufficiency but also involves chronic inflammation, protein aggregation, and degenerative processes that may not be fully reversed by anabolic stimulation alone (Bhasin et al., 2023, p. 7; Tseng et al., 2018, pp. 15–18). Therefore, while RAD140 may improve muscle mass and fiber size, its impact on overall muscle function and disease progression in IBM remains uncertain. Second, some concerns have been raised about potential hepatotoxic effects with SARMs in general, as evidenced by reports of liver enzyme elevations and cases of drug‐induced liver injury in recreational use, though these adverse events are mostly noted at supraphysiological doses or with unregulated preparations (Ladna et al., 2023, pp. 1–2; Vignali et al., 2023, pp. 2–3). Third, the translation of preclinical dosing to effective human regimens requires careful consideration, particularly since animal models do not completely recapitulate the multifactorial pathology of IBM, and dosing variability—as observed in some rodent studies—could influence therapeutic outcomes (Puskas, 2022, pp. 35–46; Miller et al., 2011, pp. 5–6). Finally, while the oral bioavailability and ease of administration are significant advantages, long‐term safety and efficacy data in the specific context of IBM are lacking, and additional studies, both preclinical in disease‐specific models and clinical trials, are necessary to fully validate its utility (Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 8–9; Feike et al., 2021, pp. 1–2).

In conclusion, RAD140 is an attractive candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for Inclusion Body Myositis due to its potent anabolic activity, favorable tissue selectivity, and convenient oral dosing. Its mechanism of selective androgen receptor modulation, which effectively enhances muscle protein synthesis and hypertrophy without extensive androgenic side effects, aligns well with the therapeutic needs of IBM where muscle wasting is a principal concern (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 3–4; Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 16–21). However, the complex nature of IBM demands that future research addresses not only the anabolic capacity of RAD140 but also its effects on the inflammatory and degenerative aspects of the disease. Rigorous clinical trials are required to determine whether the promising preclinical results can be translated into meaningful clinical benefits in IBM patients, including improved muscle strength, function, and quality of life, while ensuring an acceptable long‐term safety profile (Bhasin et al., 2023, pp. 4–5; Puskas, 2022, pp. 29–35). Overall, while RAD140’s profile is compelling, its development for IBM will likely necessitate combination strategies or adjunct therapies to fully address the multifaceted pathology of the disease. Given these considerations, RAD140 holds potential for inclusion in our drug development portfolio, contingent upon further targeted research to validate both efficacy and safety in the context of inclusion body myositis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Miller et al., 2011, p. 6).
