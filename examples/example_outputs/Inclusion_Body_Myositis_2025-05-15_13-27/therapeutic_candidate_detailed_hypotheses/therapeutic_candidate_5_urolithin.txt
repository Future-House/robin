Proposal for Urolithin A

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Urolithin A is a naturally occurring compound derived from the microbial metabolism of ellagitannins, a family of polyphenolic compounds present in fruits such as pomegranates, berries, and nuts. It is produced endogenously in the human gut when the resident microbiota convert dietary ellagic acid and ellagitannins into urolithins. In recent years, synthetic methods have also been developed for obtaining pure Urolithin A, thereby ensuring standardized formulations for research and therapeutic use (Djedjibegovic et al., 2020; Wilhelmsen et al., 2025). Pharmacologically, Urolithin A belongs to the class of gut microbiota-derived postbiotic metabolites with potent mitochondrial modulatory activity. This class of compounds has been investigated primarily for their ability to improve mitochondrial quality control through the induction of mitophagy—a process in which damaged mitochondria are selectively degraded and recycled. Traditionally, polyphenol derivatives and their microbial metabolites have been explored as nutraceuticals to combat age-related muscle decline; Urolithin A exemplifies these attributes by offering a mechanistic link between dietary intake, gut microbial metabolism, and improved cellular bioenergetics (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Therapeutic History:
Biochemical and clinical studies have highlighted Urolithin A’s activity in improving mitochondrial function in aging muscle and other tissues. Preclinical animal models, including studies in Caenorhabditis elegans, rodents, and muscle cell cultures, have demonstrated that Urolithin A can extend lifespan, improve muscle function, and enhance mitochondrial biogenesis through the activation of autophagic pathways (Faitg et al., 2024; Toney et al., 2021). Phase I human clinical trials have confirmed that oral supplementation with Urolithin A is safe and results in a dose‐dependent upregulation of mitochondrial gene expression in skeletal muscle, along with enhanced markers of mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress metabolites (Singh et al., 2019; Amazentis SA, 2019). Although Urolithin A has not been directly used in clinical studies targeting Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), its prior applications in improving muscle mitochondrial function, endurance, and overall cellular health in aging populations provide a strong rationale for its repurposing. No direct therapeutic studies have yet been conducted in IBM patients; however, the similarity in the pathophysiology of mitochondrial dysfunction between age-related sarcopenia and IBM supports the hypothesis that Urolithin A may ameliorate muscle degeneration via its mitophagy-inducing effects (Jayatunga et al., 2021; Mantzourani et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Urolithin A is recognized for its ability to activate mitophagy through multiple interconnected pathways. Its mechanism involves the upregulation of key genes and proteins that orchestrate mitochondrial quality control. Preclinical studies have shown that Urolithin A induces the expression and activity of PINK1 and Parkin—two critical mediators in the mitophagy pathway. Under conditions of mitochondrial damage, PINK1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane and recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which tags dysfunctional mitochondria for degradation. By stimulating the PINK1/Parkin pathway, Urolithin A facilitates the recognition and clearance of impaired mitochondria, thereby reducing the burden of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promoting cellular health (Faitg et al., 2024; Moradi, 2022).

In addition to the canonical PINK1/Parkin pathway, Urolithin A has been reported to modulate other regulators of mitochondrial dynamics. It upregulates transcription factors such as TFEB and PGC-1α, which are involved in autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis, respectively. This coordinated response not only aids in the removal of damaged mitochondria but also stimulates the generation of new, functionally competent mitochondria, thereby improving overall cellular energy homeostasis (Hou et al., 2024; Faitg et al., 2024). Moreover, Urolithin A has been shown to promote the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, a critical step that ensures the efficient degradation of mitochondrial components. This autophagosome–lysosome fusion is essential for complete mitophagic flux and is supported by proteomic analyses that reveal upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes and markers of mitochondrial abundance (Jayatunga et al., 2021; Mantzourani et al., 2024).

The compound exerts additional protective effects by reducing the cellular levels of ROS, which are often elevated in conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction. Elevated ROS can contribute to sarcomere damage, protein oxidation, and subsequent muscle weakness—a hallmark of neuromuscular degeneration as seen in IBM. By decreasing ROS-mediated damage, Urolithin A potentially preserves the integrity of contractile proteins and maintains muscle force (Amazentis SA, 2024; Djedjibegovic et al., 2020). The molecular interactions of Urolithin A extend beyond these key players to involve modulation of inflammatory pathways; it has been shown to reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and CRP, further contributing to an environment conducive to muscle repair and regeneration (Toney et al., 2021; Jayatunga et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for using Urolithin A in Inclusion Body Myositis stems from its established effects in preclinical models of muscle aging. IBM is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates and dysfunctional mitochondria, leading to chronic inflammation and progressive muscle weakness. The expected effect of Urolithin A in IBM myotubes would be the activation of mitophagy via upregulation of the PINK1/Parkin axis, thereby clearing dysfunctional mitochondria and reducing the cellular load of ROS. In turn, this reduction in oxidative stress is anticipated to alleviate sarcomere damage that contributes to the decline in muscle contractility (Faitg et al., 2024; Jayatunga et al., 2021).

In the proposed assay, IBM myotubes derived from patient muscle biopsies or relevant IBM cell models would be treated with Urolithin A. Key readouts would include the assessment of mitophagy markers—such as increased expression of PINK1, Parkin, and LC3-II—and a reduction in ROS levels, as measured by standard biochemical assays. These biochemical improvements should correlate with functional endpoints, such as enhanced contractile force in ex vivo muscle preparations or improved mitochondrial respiration as measured by oxygen consumption assays (Li et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2019). The activation of autophagosome–lysosome fusion, a specific action of Urolithin A, is critical because it ensures that the upregulated mitophagy indeed results in effective clearance of damaged mitochondria, rather than merely increasing autophagosome formation without subsequent degradation. The literature provides evidence that this mechanism supports recovery of mitochondrial quality and improves muscle force recovery in aging models, and a similar benefit is expected in the context of IBM (Moradi, 2022; Mantzourani et al., 2024).

Furthermore, gene expression analyses in IBM myotubes treated with Urolithin A are expected to show upregulation of transcription factors such as TFEB—a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis—and PGC-1α, which promotes mitochondrial biogenesis. These changes should synergistically lead to both a decrease in the accumulation of defective mitochondria and an increase in the number of functional mitochondria, thereby restoring cellular energy balance and muscle contractile function. Additionally, because inclusion body myositis is associated with chronic low-level inflammation, the anti-inflammatory properties of Urolithin A may attenuate inflammatory signaling, further contributing to improved muscle health (Jayatunga et al., 2021; Toney et al., 2021).

Overall, proteomic and transcriptomic data from prior studies in aging human muscle correlate improved mitochondrial quality with enhanced muscle strength and endurance after Urolithin A supplementation. These findings suggest that in IBM, a similar mechanistic basis may yield restored muscle force and reduced progression of muscle degeneration when dysfunctional mitochondria are efficiently cleared (Moradi, 2022; Li et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Urolithin A presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis due to its multifaceted mechanism of action that directly addresses mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress—two central features of the disease pathology. Its natural origin as a gut microbiota-derived metabolite and established safety profile in phase I clinical trials support its developmental feasibility. The fact that Urolithin A has been shown to stimulate the PINK1/Parkin pathway, enhance autophagosome–lysosome fusion, and upregulate critical regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis (TFEB and PGC-1α) makes it mechanistically well-suited for restoring muscle force in diseases characterized by mitochondrial impairment and ROS-mediated sarcomere damage (Faitg et al., 2024; Hou et al., 2024).

Strengths of Urolithin A include its dual role in promoting mitochondrial turnover and attenuating inflammatory processes, both of which are considered important in managing neuromuscular disorders such as IBM. The compound’s status as a nutritional supplement with well-characterized pharmacokinetics further enhances its appeal, as it can be rapidly advanced into clinical studies without the extensive safety concerns usually associated with new chemical entities (Singh et al., 2019; Amazentis SA, 2019). Moreover, the existing clinical evidence demonstrating improved mitochondrial gene expression and reductions in plasma acylcarnitine levels in healthy elderly individuals suggests that its use as a mitochondrial enhancer is both effective and clinically translatable (Amazentis SA, 2024; Mantzourani et al., 2024).

However, there are also challenges to consider. Although preclinical studies in aging models provide a strong rationale, there is no direct clinical evidence of efficacy in IBM or even in muscle diseases specifically characterized by inclusion bodies. The underlying pathology of IBM is complex, with inflammatory components, protein aggregation, and autoimmune features that may not be fully addressed by solely enhancing mitophagy. Additional studies will be required to determine whether the mitochondrial improvements seen with Urolithin A translate into meaningful clinical benefits in the context of IBM, where the interplay between degeneration and inflammation is pronounced (Jayatunga et al., 2021; Mantzourani et al., 2024). Furthermore, given the heterogeneity in human gut microbiota and the metabolic differences among individuals (the so‐called urolithin metabotypes), there may be variability in response to Urolithin A supplementation, which must be carefully considered in clinical trial design (Vini et al., 2022).

Despite these challenges, the mechanistic specificity of Urolithin A in promoting autophagosome–lysosome fusion and clearing damaged mitochondria provides a solid scientific foundation for its use in IBM. The proposal’s focus on restoring contractile function through improved mitochondrial turnover is strongly supported by data from aging models where mitochondrial quality control correlates with muscle force recovery (Moradi, 2022; Li et al., 2022). The expected translational outcome—mitophagy induction leading to reduced ROS levels and preservation of sarcomere structure—aligns closely with the needs for therapeutic intervention in IBM. Current clinical trials evaluating Urolithin A in other contexts (e.g., glucose metabolism in older adults, pharmacokinetic evaluations in healthy volunteers) further reinforce the compound’s developmental feasibility and safety profile (National Institute on Aging, 2024; Amazentis SA, 2024).

In summary, Urolithin A exhibits significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis. Its ability to activate mitophagy via PINK1/Parkin, enhance autophagosome–lysosome fusion, reduce oxidative stress, and ultimately restore mitochondrial function and muscle strength positions it as a scientifically compelling candidate. The strengths of established clinical safety, well-documented mechanistic basis, and preclinical evidence of improved muscle function outweigh the current limitations regarding direct evidence in IBM. Moving forward, focused preclinical studies in IBM-relevant models and carefully designed pilot clinical trials will be essential to validate Urolithin A’s efficacy in this challenging neuromuscular disease (Djedjibegovic et al., 2020; Toney et al., 2021).

Overall, based on the comprehensive review of biochemical, clinical, and mechanistic literature, Urolithin A is a promising candidate for repurposing as a treatment for Inclusion Body Myositis, warranting further investigation in this specific disease context (Jayatunga et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022).
