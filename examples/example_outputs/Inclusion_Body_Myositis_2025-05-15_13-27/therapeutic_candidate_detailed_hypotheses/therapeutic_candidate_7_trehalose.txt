Proposal for Trehalose

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Trehalose is a naturally occurring nonreducing disaccharide composed of two glucose molecules linked via an α,α-1,1-glycosidic bond. Originally discovered in lower organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and plants, trehalose functions as an osmolyte and a chemical chaperone, protecting cells from diverse environmental stresses including desiccation, heat, and oxidative stress (Mardones et al., 2016). It has been used extensively as a food additive and pharmaceutical stabilizer due to its high chemical stability and favorable safety profile, as evidenced by its Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status granted by the FDA and European regulators (Khalifeh et al., 2020). Belonging to the class of small-molecule osmolytes that modulate proteostasis, trehalose has attracted considerable attention as a therapeutic candidate for diseases characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation. Its discovery and purification are entirely based on its natural biosynthesis in organisms such as yeast and fungi, rather than through chemical synthesis, which contributes to its low-cost production and ease of repurposing for clinical applications (Kul & Stork, 2024; Maruf et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, trehalose has been investigated in a range of experimental settings spanning neurodegenerative conditions, metabolic diseases, and even some forms of muscular dystrophies. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that trehalose is effective at inducing autophagy, thereby reducing toxic protein aggregates in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Khalifeh et al., 2019; Mustapha et al., 2023). In addition, early-phase clinical studies have explored its safety and tolerability in humans; for instance, clinical trials involving neurodegenerative disorders have reported a good safety profile, with minimal side effects observed even after prolonged administration (Khalifeh et al., 2020; Sahebkar et al., 2021). While trehalose has not been extensively trialed in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) specifically, there have been several clinical investigations wherein trehalose was administered in related myopathic conditions and other protein aggregation disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Furthermore, its use in a muscle cell model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy demonstrated that trehalose effectively reduced aggregate formation by enhancing autophagic clearance, providing an experimental precedent for its potential use in diseases like IBM that share similar pathological hallmarks (Cicardi, 2016). Such evidence from both neurodegenerative and muscle-directed experiments underscores trehalose’s versatility as a repurposed therapeutic candidate and supports the rationale for advancing it into studies focused on IBM.

Mechanism of Action:
Trehalose exerts its biological effects predominantly by inducing autophagy via an mTOR-independent pathway. One key facet of its mechanism is the inhibition of glucose transport by blocking solute carrier 2A (SLC2A/GLUT) transporters. This competitive inhibition mimics a state of cellular nutrient deprivation, thereby activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) which, in turn, phosphorylates the autophagy initiator ULK1 to trigger autophagosome biogenesis (Mardones et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2019). In parallel, trehalose has been shown to stabilize lysosomal membranes and to induce nuclear translocation of Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), the master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway. TFEB activation leads to the upregulation of genes responsible for lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, facilitating the clearance of aggregated proteins—a mechanism of particular relevance in disorders characterized by proteostatic defects (Jeong et al., 2021; Khalifeh et al., 2020). Moreover, trehalose exhibits chemical chaperone activity by forming a protective glass-like matrix around proteins, thereby minimizing deleterious folding errors and preventing aggregate formation (Khalifeh et al., 2019). Some studies have also suggested that trehalose may promote autophagy through additional pathways including the modulation of endocytosis and lysosomal pH changes, which collectively contribute to an enhanced autophagic flux (Martinon et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2018). These combined mechanisms, including AMPK-ULK1-mediated autophagy induction and TFEB-driven lysosomal enhancement, provide a robust biochemical basis for trehalose’s ability to reduce the cellular burden of misfolded proteins and aggregated inclusions in diseased cells.

Expected Effect:
In the context of Inclusion Body Myositis, the proposed hypothesis is that trehalose will induce autophagy via TFEB nuclear translocation in IBM patient myotubes, leading to enhanced clearance of pathological protein aggregates and restoration of contractile amplitude. IBM myotubes are characterized by the accumulation of intracellular protein inclusions that disrupt normal cellular function and contribute to muscle weakness. By activating TFEB, trehalose is expected to upregulate a suite of autophagy- and lysosome-related genes, thereby facilitating the degradation of these toxic aggregates (Frapporti, 2023; Khalifeh et al., 2020). In vitro assays using IBM patient-derived myotubes should show a reduction in protein inclusions and improvement in markers of autophagic flux, such as increased LC3-II conversion and decreased levels of p62, which serve as proxies for active autophagy (Mustapha et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2019). Additionally, it is anticipated that the clearance of aggregates correlates with improved muscle fiber contractility and overall cellular function, thereby potentially reversing the biomechanical impairments observed in IBM (Cicardi, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). The expected efficacy in protein aggregate clearance is further supported by data from neurodegenerative models where trehalose administration led to behavioral improvements paralleled by reduced pathological aggregation, which, by analogy, could translate to functional improvements in IBM skeletal muscle (Holler et al., 2016; Khalifeh et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
Trehalose presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis due to several compelling attributes. First, its natural origin and widespread use as a food additive confer an excellent safety profile, which is crucial for repurposing efforts in chronic diseases (Khalifeh et al., 2020; Martinon et al., 2020). Its dual mechanism—functioning both as an osmolyte to stabilize proteins and as a potent inducer of autophagy via AMPK/ULK1 activation and TFEB nuclear translocation—addresses the core pathological features of IBM, namely proteostasis imbalance and impaired aggregate clearance (Jeong et al., 2021; Mardones et al., 2016). Multiple preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing protein inclusions in models of neurodegeneration and muscle diseases, and although direct clinical trials in IBM are currently sparse, emerging data from related myopathies and neurodegenerative conditions provide strong inferential support for its mechanism (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b; Jaber et al., 2025; Sahebkar et al., 2021).

Strengths of trehalose include its proven capacity to induce autophagy via mTOR-independent pathways, a mechanism that bypasses some of the adverse effects associated with classical mTOR inhibitors, and its ability to activate TFEB, which plays a pivotal role in lysosomal biogenesis and cellular recycling. This multifaceted mode of action is advantageous in tackling the diverse pathological cascades encountered in IBM, where muscle fibers accumulate various toxic aggregates that impair cellular contractility (Frapporti, 2023; Khalifeh et al., 2019). Developmental feasibility is high given trehalose’s status as a food-grade compound with established ADME characteristics and tolerability in preclinical animal models, alongside encouraging early results from clinical investigations in neurodegenerative diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a; Mustapha et al., 2023).

However, certain weaknesses must be acknowledged. One notable limitation of trehalose is its relatively poor bioavailability when administered orally due to rapid metabolism by trehalase enzymes in the intestine and kidney, which may necessitate the use of alternative formulations or delivery systems, such as trehalose-bearing nanocarriers, to achieve therapeutic concentrations in muscle tissue (Jaber, 2024; Jeong et al., 2021). Additionally, while the mechanistic rationale is strong, direct clinical evidence in IBM remains limited and further rigorous preclinical studies using IBM patient-derived myotubes, as well as eventual controlled clinical trials, are required to validate its efficacy and dosing regimen in this specific context (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a; Jaber, 2024; Mustapha et al., 2023). Furthermore, variability in autophagic responses between different cell types and disease stages could affect therapeutic outcomes, necessitating careful stratification of patient populations and optimization of treatment timing (Khalifeh et al., 2020; Mustapha et al., 2023).

In conclusion, trehalose stands out as a highly attractive drug candidate for repurposing in Inclusion Body Myositis. Its natural derivation, well-established safety profile, and multifactorial mechanism of action—emphasizing both the stabilization of protein homeostasis and the induction of autophagy through TFEB activation—position it favorably for further investigation. While the current evidence supports its potential to clear pathological protein aggregates in IBM myotubes and restore contractile function, challenges in bioavailability and the current lack of direct clinical trial data in IBM must be addressed through further preclinical studies and optimized delivery strategies. Overall, the strengths of trehalose, particularly its mechanistic specificity and developmental feasibility, outweigh its weaknesses, making it a promising candidate to advance in our drug development pipeline for Inclusion Body Myositis (Khalifeh et al., 2019; Martinon et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a).
