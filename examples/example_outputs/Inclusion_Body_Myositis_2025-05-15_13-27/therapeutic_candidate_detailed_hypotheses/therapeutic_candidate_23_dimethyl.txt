Proposal for Dimethyl Fumarate

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a small-molecule fumaric acid ester originally derived from fumaric acid, a naturally occurring dicarboxylic acid present in various fruits and vegetables, and later synthesized into a pharmaceutically active compound known as Tecfidera® (McGuire et al., 2016). It belongs to the class of fumaric acid esters (FAEs), a group of immunomodulatory and cytoprotective compounds that were initially developed for the treatment of psoriasis and later repurposed for multiple sclerosis (MS) owing to their robust anti‐inflammatory and antioxidant activities (McGuire et al., 2016). DMF is formulated as an oral delayed‐release tablet that, upon ingestion, is rapidly hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract to its primary active metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The chemical synthesis of DMF involves esterifying fumaric acid with methanol under controlled conditions, yielding a compound with an electrophilic α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl system, which enables covalent interactions with specific cysteine residues on target proteins (Albrecht et al., 2012). This structural feature is key to its mechanism of action and places DMF within a broader class of electrophilic immunomodulators that modulate redox‐sensitive signaling pathways (Albrecht et al., 2012).

Therapeutic History:
DMF has a well‐established therapeutic history in dermatological and neurological disorders, having been used for decades in the treatment of psoriasis in Europe before its repurposing for relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) (McGuire et al., 2016). Clinical trials in MS have demonstrated DMF’s efficacy in reducing the frequency of relapses and slowing disease progression while maintaining a favorable safety profile over long‐term administration (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023). Its pharmacological benefits in MS were largely attributed to its dual roles in activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway and inhibiting pro‐inflammatory signaling, mechanisms that provide neuroprotection as well as immunomodulation (Albrecht et al., 2012). Although DMF has not been thoroughly tested in clinical trials specifically targeting Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), several preclinical and early‐stage studies in inflammatory myopathies and muscle models support its potential utility by reducing muscle inflammation and preserving contractile properties (Albrecht et al., 2012; Cantó‐Santos et al., 2023). The drug class to which DMF belongs has a strong precedent in treating conditions characterized by immune dysregulation and oxidative stress, providing a rationale for its repurposing in diseases such as IBM that share common pathophysiological features (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
DMF’s primary mechanism of action centers on the activation of the Nrf2 pathway, which is achieved through covalent modification of cysteine residues on Kelch‐like ECH‐associated protein 1 (Keap1), the cytosolic repressor of Nrf2, leading to Nrf2 stabilization and its subsequent nuclear translocation (McGuire et al., 2016). Once in the nucleus, Nrf2 binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoter regions of a battery of detoxifying and cytoprotective genes, resulting in the upregulation of enzymes such as heme oxygenase‐1 (HO‐1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and various glutathione S‐transferases that collectively enhance cellular antioxidant defenses (Belcher et al., 2017). In addition to Nrf2 activation, DMF exerts immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting NF‐κB signaling, in part through interference with ubiquitin‐dependent processes; specifically, it inhibits TLR‐induced formation of M1 and K63‐linked polyubiquitin chains on key signaling intermediates, thereby reducing NF‐κB nuclear translocation and subsequent pro‐inflammatory cytokine production (McGuire et al., 2016). This inhibition of NF‐κB is achieved by covalently modifying cysteine residues on pivotal proteins involved in the phosphorylation and degradation cascade of IκB, which normally restrains NF‐κB activity (McGuire et al., 2016). Furthermore, DMF’s ability to deplete intracellular glutathione transiently and then promote glutathione recycling contributes to enhanced cellular resistance to oxidative damage, linking its antioxidant capacity to improved proteostasis (Albrecht et al., 2012). In addition to its effects on redox biology and inflammation, DMF’s modulation of immune cell profiles—specifically reducing pro‐inflammatory Th1 and Th17 subsets while promoting regulatory anti‐inflammatory responses—completes its multifaceted mechanism, which is essential for countering the complex pathology observed in IBM (Belcher et al., 2017; Duleh et al., 2016).

Expected Effect:
In the context of Inclusion Body Myositis, the hypothesis posits that by activating the Nrf2 pathway and inhibiting NF‐κB signaling, DMF will reduce oxidative stress and the production of inflammatory cytokines in IBM myotubes, which in turn is expected to improve proteostasis and muscle contractility (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Specifically, the enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes via Nrf2 activation should mitigate the oxidative damage that contributes to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and proteostatic dysregulation within muscle fibers (Albrecht et al., 2012). Moreover, by dampening NF‐κB mediated inflammation, DMF is anticipated to reduce the chronic inflammatory milieu that disrupts normal muscle homeostasis and leads to detrimental muscle fiber degeneration (McGuire et al., 2016). Experimental evidence in muscle disease models has indicated that interventions targeting these pathways can preserve muscle fiber integrity and improve contractility, thereby supporting the expectation that DMF may yield similar benefits in IBM (Cantó‐Santos et al., 2023). In vitro assays using IBM myotubes that assess proteostasis markers, such as the clearance of aggregated proteins and the stabilization of contractile proteins, alongside measurements of cytokine levels and oxidative stress markers, are expected to reveal that DMF treatment results in decreased inflammatory cytokine production and reduction in oxidative stress markers, leading to improved muscle cell function (Albrecht et al., 2012). Additionally, the immunomodulatory effects of DMF, which include the suppression of pro‐inflammatory T cell responses, may further alleviate the immune‐mediated muscle damage that characterizes IBM, as supported by analogous findings in MS models where DMF reduced infiltration of pathogenic immune cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, DMF represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on its established pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and multifaceted mechanism of action that addresses both oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways central to IBM pathology (Albrecht et al., 2012). One of the principal strengths of DMF is its oral delayed‐release formulation, which offers excellent bioavailability and has already been shown to be safe and well tolerated over long‐term use in both MS and psoriasis patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023; Pascale et al., 2020). Furthermore, its dual action—activating the Nrf2 pathway to boost intracellular antioxidant defenses and concurrently inhibiting NF‐κB signaling through selective inhibition of polyubiquitin chain formation—directly targets the two major components of IBM’s pathological cascade: oxidative stress and chronic inflammation (McGuire et al., 2016; Belcher et al., 2017). The mechanistic specificity provided by covalent cysteine modification on Keap1 and on regulatory elements of the NF‐κB pathway suggests that DMF can exert a potent and selective regulatory influence on these cellular processes (Albrecht et al., 2012). Preclinical studies in related inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease models further substantiate the therapeutic potential of DMF by demonstrating reduced inflammatory cytokine production and improved cellular proteostasis (Belcher et al., 2017; Duleh et al., 2016).

However, there are several weaknesses and challenges that need to be addressed. Despite the encouraging mechanistic data, direct preclinical evidence linking DMF to improved muscle proteostasis or increased contractility specifically in IBM models is currently limited (McGuire et al., 2016). Additional studies focused on muscle‐specific endpoints such as muscle fiber regeneration, contractile function, and clearance of aggregated proteins in IBM are essential to translate these cellular effects into functional improvement (Cantó‐Santos et al., 2023; Pascale et al., 2020). Moreover, while the immunomodulatory effects of DMF observed in neuroinflammatory disorders are promising, IBM is a complex disease with both inflammatory and degenerative components that may not respond to immunomodulation alone, highlighting the inherent risk that DMF might only partially address the multifactorial pathology of IBM (Goyal & Mozaffar, 2018). Another potential limitation is the transient glutathione depletion reported with DMF treatment, which although linked to subsequent antioxidant response, could exacerbate acute oxidative stress if not carefully controlled in already compromised muscle tissue (Albrecht et al., 2012). Additionally, the heterogeneity in IBM patient populations means that response to DMF may vary, necessitating robust biomarker development to identify those who are most likely to benefit (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024).

In summary, DMF’s repurposing for IBM is supported by its dual antioxidant and immunomodulatory actions, its established oral bioavailability, and its proven safety in chronic inflammatory conditions such as MS and psoriasis (McGuire et al., 2016; Pascale et al., 2020). Its mechanism—centered on Nrf2 activation and NF‐κB inhibition—directly targets key molecular pathways implicated in IBM, namely oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and proteostasis impairment (Albrecht et al., 2012; Belcher et al., 2017). The expected outcome is a reduction in inflammatory cytokine production, improved clearance of misfolded proteins, and enhanced muscle cell survival and contractility in IBM myotubes (Albrecht et al., 2012; Cantó‐Santos et al., 2023). Nonetheless, the absence of direct clinical or robust preclinical evidence in IBM contexts remains a key obstacle that must be overcome through targeted studies focusing on muscle‐specific endpoints and functional outcomes (Goyal & Mozaffar, 2018; McGuire et al., 2016). Therefore, while DMF is a strong candidate for repurposing, further rigorous investigation using muscle disease models and well‐designed clinical trials is necessary to definitively establish its efficacy, optimal dosing, and long‐term safety in patients with Inclusion Body Myositis (Goyal & Mozaffar, 2018; McGuire et al., 2016).
