Proposal for Fasudil

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fasudil is a fully synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor developed as a Rho‐kinase (ROCK) inhibitor. Chemically, it is an isoquinoline sulfonamide derivative—often chemically described as hexahydro-1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-1H-1,4-diazepine—that was initially discovered for its potent vasodilatory and cerebrovascular effects. Its synthesis involves modifications such as those on the homopiperazine ring and sulfonamide linkage, which are critical for its binding specificity to the ATP‐binding pocket of ROCK enzymes (Unknown Reference, 2014; Logé et al., 2003). Fasudil belongs to the class of synthetic ROCK inhibitors, a compound class that has been widely utilized in both preclinical and clinical settings mainly for cardiovascular and neurological indications. The established precedent for this class is that they modulate the actin cytoskeleton, smooth muscle contractility, and inflammatory responses by inhibiting ROCK‐mediated phosphorylation processes. This synthetic origin and extensive medicinal chemistry development have rendered fasudil a highly reproducible and well‐characterized therapeutic candidate appropriate for potential repurposing in other conditions such as Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) (Chen et al., 2013; Liao et al., 2007).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, fasudil has gained regulatory approval in Japan for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage, and it is also approved for other vascular indications such as pulmonary hypertension and stable angina pectoris. Its clinical use over the past two decades has provided extensive human safety and pharmacokinetic data both under intravenous administration and, more recently, via oral formulations in early‐phase trials (Wolff et al., 2024; Lai & Frishman, 2005). In animal models of neuromuscular disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), ROCK inhibition with fasudil has been shown to reduce fibrosis and improve muscle strength through the attenuation of fibro‐adipogenic progenitor cell activation, offering a strong proof‐of‐concept for its utility in modulating muscle pathology (Fernández‐Simón et al., 2021; Unknown Reference, 2014). Nonetheless, no direct clinical or preclinical studies have yet focused on applying fasudil to Inclusion Body Myositis or similar inflammatory myopathies. While its established use has been in vascular and central nervous system diseases, the underlying mechanism—modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and inflammation—provides a sound rationale for exploration in IBM, a disease characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and cytoskeletal abnormalities in muscle tissue (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Takata et al., 2013).

Mechanism of Action:
Fasudil exerts its pharmacological effects primarily by inhibiting the activity of both ROCK1 and ROCK2 isoforms. These serine/threonine kinases are downstream effectors of the small GTPase RhoA and are critical regulators of actin cytoskeleton organization. Fasudil acts as an ATP‐competitive inhibitor, binding specifically to the conserved kinase domain of ROCK and thereby blocking the phosphorylation of several downstream substrates such as myosin light chain (MLC) and the myosin‐binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (MYPT1). This inhibition translates into reduced smooth muscle contraction, decreased formation of stress fibers, and a lowered inflammatory response mediated in part by NF-κB signaling (Chen et al., 2013; Shi & Wei, 2013). Beyond its effect on the contractile apparatus, fasudil’s inhibition of ROCK results in modulation of cytokine production and reduction in the recruitment of inflammatory cells, processes that are particularly relevant in muscle inflammation. Moreover, studies have detailed that fasudil can decrease the expression of fibrogenic signals such as TGF-β1 and collagen deposition, leading to attenuation of fibrosis in various tissues (Fernández-Simón et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2011). At the molecular level, modifications to structural moieties of fasudil—such as its isoquinoline ring—are critical to its binding affinity, and analogs that improve selectivity (e.g., H-1152P) underscore the drug’s capacity to modulate both cytoskeletal dynamics and inflammatory cascades (Chen et al., 2013; Logé et al., 2003).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism, the hypothesis for repurposing fasudil in Inclusion Body Myositis is that by inhibiting ROCK, fasudil will enhance myotube contractility, improve cytoskeletal organization, and reduce inflammatory cell infiltration in diseased muscle tissue. In experimental dystrophic models, ROCK inhibitors have been shown to improve muscle force generation and reduce depositions of fibrotic collagen (Fernández‐Simón et al., 2021; Boyce-Rustay et al., 2010). Given that the contractile machinery in muscle fibers is highly dependent on proper actin filament organization and the integrity of the cytoskeleton, fasudil’s action in reducing aberrant phosphorylation of myosin light chain and restoring balanced cytoskeletal dynamics is anticipated to improve myotube contractility. Additionally, ROCK signaling has been implicated in the regulation of inflammatory cytokine production and immune cell migration, meaning that fasudil could potentially mitigate the inflammatory milieu observed in IBM muscle tissue (Takata et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2013). Importantly, the expression of ROCK has been documented in skeletal muscle cells, and its dysregulation may contribute to the impaired contractility seen in IBM; thus, dampening its activity is expected to restore physiological function (Chen et al., 2013; Liao et al., 2007).

Overall Evaluation:
Fasudil presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in Inclusion Body Myositis due to several notable strengths. First, its synthetic origin and extensive chemical derivation have resulted in a molecule with a well‐understood structure‐activity relationship and reproducible pharmacokinetic profile (Unknown Reference, 2014; Logé et al., 2003). Second, its established clinical use in cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases confirms a high degree of human tolerability and safety, with robust pharmacokinetic data supporting both intravenous and emerging oral formulations (Wolff et al., 2024; Unknown Reference, 2009). Third, fasudil’s mechanism of action—targeting both cytoskeletal organization and inflammatory pathways through ROCK inhibition—addresses two fundamental pathological features of IBM: cytoskeletal disarray and chronic inflammation. The inhibition of ROCK‐mediated phosphorylation directly impacts muscle cell contractility and the deposition of extracellular matrix components, potentially reducing fibrosis and improving overall muscle function (Chen et al., 2013; Fernández-Simón et al., 2021). Fourth, preclinical data from dystrophic and ischemic models provide promising evidence that ROCK inhibition can ameliorate muscle pathology, even though direct studies in IBM have not been conducted. This mechanistic extrapolation is supported by improvements in muscle strength and reduction in fibrosis in DMD models treated with fasudil (Fernández-Simón et al., 2021; Takata et al., 2013).

Despite these strengths, several weaknesses and limitations must be considered. Foremost is the lack of direct preclinical or clinical evidence regarding fasudil’s efficacy in IBM or myositis‐related conditions. While data from cardiovascular and dystrophic models are encouraging, the translation to IBM remains hypothetical without targeted in vivo or in vitro studies in IBM muscle tissue (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chen et al., 2013). Another potential limitation is the non‐selectivity of fasudil for ROCK isoforms; since ROCK2 expression is particularly high in skeletal muscle and neuronal tissues, more isoform‐selective inhibitors might offer a more tailored therapeutic profile with fewer off‐target effects (Chen et al., 2013; Liao et al., 2007). Additionally, while the human safety profile of fasudil is well‐established in other indications, there exists a need for detailed pharmacodynamic studies to determine its optimal dosing, route of administration, and potential long‐term effects specifically in myositis patients (Wolff et al., 2024; Unknown Reference, 2009). Finally, the potential for off‐target inhibition of related kinases at higher concentrations may lead to unintended effects, necessitating careful dose optimization and possibly warranting the exploration of next‐generation analogs or prodrug formulations to limit systemic side effects (Chen et al., 2013; Al-Hilal et al., 2021).

In summary, the repurposing of fasudil for Inclusion Body Myositis is scientifically grounded in its well‐documented mechanism of ROCK inhibition, modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, and anti‐inflammatory properties. Its robust clinical safety record in vascular and cerebrovascular applications, combined with encouraging preclinical data in dystrophic conditions, provides a strong rationale for further investigation. However, direct evidence in IBM models is currently absent, and additional preclinical studies will be critical to assess its efficacy and optimal dosing strategies in muscle‐specific contexts. Overall, fasudil is a promising therapeutic candidate that warrants immediate and comprehensive investigation into its potential to enhance myotube contractility, improve cytoskeletal organization, and reduce inflammatory infiltration in IBM, thereby possibly alleviating the progressive muscle weakness characteristic of this disease (Takata et al., 2013; Fernández-Simón et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013; Wolff et al., 2024; Liao et al., 2007).
