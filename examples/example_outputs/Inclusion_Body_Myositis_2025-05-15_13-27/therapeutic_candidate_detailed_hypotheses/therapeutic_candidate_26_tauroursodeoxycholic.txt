Proposal for Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid (TUDCA)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid (TUDCA) is a naturally occurring bile acid derivative originally found as a taurine‐conjugated form of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Historically, TUDCA was discovered in traditional Chinese medicine and later developed for its hepatoprotective properties. It belongs to the class of chemical chaperones—compounds that assist in the proper folding of proteins and alleviate stress within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). TUDCA’s favorable attributes include low toxicity, oral bioavailability, and the ability to modulate multiple cell signaling pathways. It is FDA approved for treating certain cholestatic liver diseases, and its use as a chemical chaperone has been explored in a wide range of disease models characterized by ER stress and protein misfolding (Kusaczuk, 2019).

Therapeutic History:
TUDCA has a long history of application in both clinical and preclinical settings. Clinically, it has been used to treat primary biliary cholangitis and other hepatobiliary disorders due to its cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic properties. In the realm of protein misfolding and ER stress, TUDCA has shown promise in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as in metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes. Preclinical studies have demonstrated its ability to reduce ER stress markers—including binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and active forms of ATF6—in various animal models; notably, in muscle-specific disease models such as those with OPA1 deletion and lipin-1 deficiency, which share pathological features with Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) (Zito, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although there is no direct clinical trial data specifically for IBM, multiple clinical investigations have been conducted with TUDCA in related protein aggregation disorders such as transthyretin amyloidosis and ALS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019). These studies support the concept that TUDCA’s modulation of ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) can translate into improved cellular function, providing a rationale for its repurposing in IBM and similar myopathies (Kusaczuk, 2019; Kny & Fielitz, 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, TUDCA functions primarily as a chemical chaperone that stabilizes the ER environment by promoting proper protein folding, thereby reducing the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Its mechanism involves a multifaceted modulation of the UPR. Specifically, TUDCA reduces the activation of ER stress sensors—IRE1, PERK, and ATF6—and downregulates the expression of pro-apoptotic transcription factors such as CHOP. This leads to decreased CHOP-mediated apoptosis and a restoration of proteostasis. In various animal models of myopathy and metabolic disease, TUDCA has been shown to attenuate ER stress markers (e.g., BIP, ATF6, CHOP) and reduce mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by decreased cytochrome c release and improved mitochondrial membrane integrity (Kusaczuk, 2019; Zito, 2019). Moreover, TUDCA can interact with several cell surface and nuclear receptors—including TGR5, FXR, and the glucocorticoid receptor—which may further contribute to its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects through the activation of downstream signaling pathways such as NFκB, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt (Kusaczuk, 2019; Duarte-Silva et al., 2024). This combination of direct chemical chaperoning with receptor-mediated modulation of intracellular signaling underpins TUDCA’s potential to stabilize protein folding environments and reduce cellular damage from chronic ER stress. Although much of the detailed mechanistic work has been performed in hepatocytes, neurodegenerative models, or cardiac tissues, the core cellular pathways targeted by TUDCA are also central to the pathology of IBM, where aberrant protein aggregation and persistent ER stress lead to muscle fiber degeneration (Zito, 2019; Kusaczuk, 2019).

Expected Effect:
In the context of Inclusion Body Myositis, the hypothesis is that TUDCA will alleviate the unfolded protein response activation that is a hallmark of the disease. IBM muscle pathology is marked by chronic ER stress, which drives an increased expression of markers such as BIP and CHOP. CHOP-mediated apoptosis, in particular, contributes to muscle cell loss and diminished contractile strength. By stabilizing ER membrane fluidity and aiding correct protein folding, TUDCA is expected to reduce the levels of misfolded proteins, thereby decreasing the activation of CHOP and other pro-apoptotic factors. Preclinical studies in muscle-specific models, such as those with mitochondrial defects or lipin-1 deficiency, have shown that TUDCA treatment results in improved muscle strength and reduced markers of ER stress (Zito, 2019; Kny & Fielitz, 2022). In vitro, assays performed on IBM myotubes would be expected to reveal reductions in ER stress indicators, a downregulation of CHOP, and improved proteostasis. This should translate into an improvement in contractile function of the myotubes, as the cellular environment becomes more conducive to proper protein synthesis and assembly. Given that TUDCA has already demonstrated efficacy in reducing ER stress in other cell types, including neuronal and muscle cells in diabetic and mitochondrial dysfunction models, it is reasonable to anticipate a similar protective and restorative effect in IBM muscle cells (Kusaczuk, 2019; Zito, 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
TUDCA emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on a robust mechanistic rationale and a favorable safety profile. Its natural derivation as a bile acid conjugate, well-documented history in hepatobiliary and neurodegenerative conditions, and established clinical safety in approved indications all contribute to its attractiveness for repurposing in IBM (Kusaczuk, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Strengths of TUDCA include its multifaceted mechanism of action—reducing ER stress by enhancing protein folding, downregulating the UPR and CHOP-mediated apoptosis, and modulating key signaling pathways (Zito, 2019; Duarte-Silva et al., 2024). These effects directly address pivotal aspects of IBM pathology, namely disrupted proteostasis and muscle degeneration driven by chronic ER stress. Additionally, TUDCA’s oral bioavailability and established clinical use in other indications significantly lower the barrier for clinical translation. On the other side, a notable weakness is the relative lack of direct preclinical and clinical data specifically in IBM or skeletal muscle protein aggregation disorders; current evidence is largely extrapolated from studies in neurological, hepatic, or cardiac contexts (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kusaczuk, 2019). Furthermore, while the biochemical pathways modulated by TUDCA are well established, the complexity of IBM pathogenesis means that other pathogenic mechanisms—such as inflammatory processes and autophagic dysfunction—may also need to be addressed in tandem. Overall, TUDCA’s potential to relieve ER stress and improve proteostasis in IBM remains a compelling hypothesis, but further targeted studies, including controlled preclinical experiments in IBM models and subsequent clinical trials, will be necessary to fully validate its efficacy in this challenging myopathy (Zito, 2019; Kny & Fielitz, 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In summary, TUDCA is a well-tolerated, repurposed drug with a documented ability to mitigate ER stress through chemical chaperone action, making it a promising candidate for addressing the proteostasis disruption observed in Inclusion Body Myositis. Its extensive preclinical data in reducing key ER stress markers and improving cellular survival, coupled with an established safety record, provide strong support for its further investigation as a therapeutic agent in IBM. Further detailed studies are warranted to determine the optimal dosing regimen, delivery method, and potential combination therapies that might maximize its clinical benefit in patients with IBM.
