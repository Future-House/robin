Proposal for IU1

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
IU1 is a small-molecule inhibitor originally discovered via high‐throughput screening efforts as a selective compound that targets USP14, a proteasome‐associated deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) (Chakraborty et al., 2018; LaPlante & Zhang, 2021). USP14 normally trims polyubiquitin chains from proteins destined for degradation by the 26S proteasome, thereby delaying their proteolysis. IU1 was chemically developed as a tool compound in academic and preclinical research to reverse this regulatory “brake” on the proteasome; it is a member of the class of small-molecule DUB inhibitors that are designed to enhance proteasome activity by specifically blocking USP14 activity (Chakraborty et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2024). The synthesis of IU1 and its derivatives (such as IU1-47, 1B10, and IU1-248) involved medicinal chemistry approaches that optimized the parent structure to increase potency, selectivity, and membrane permeability (LaPlante & Zhang, 2021; Qin et al., 2024). IU1 belongs to a distinct chemical class of non-covalent, allosteric inhibitors that do not bind to the catalytic cysteine directly but rather interact with regulatory loops near the catalytic site, thereby maintaining USP14 in its autoinhibited conformation (Chakraborty et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2024). Notably, this compound’s origin as a research tool in neurodegenerative disease models and cancer-related studies positions it within a chemical and mechanistic framework that has been widely used to probe the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) in various pathological contexts.

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of IU1 and its chemical class is marked primarily by preclinical studies aimed at modulating protein homeostasis through enhancement of the proteasomal degradation machinery. In cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson’s disease, inhibition of USP14 by IU1 has been shown to stimulate proteasome activity, thereby promoting the clearance of misfolded or aggregation-prone proteins (Chakraborty et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2024). For example, in studies using human neuroblastoma cells and Drosophila models of impaired mitophagy, treatment with IU1 not only increased degradation of ubiquitinated proteins but also improved mitochondrial function and locomotor performance—findings that are considered promising for diseases associated with protein aggregation (Chakraborty et al., 2018). Additionally, in cancer cell models, IU1 has demonstrated the ability to restrain proliferation and migration by interfering with USP14-mediated protein stabilization processes (Srinivasan et al., 2023). Although there is robust experimental evidence supporting the use of USP14 inhibitors in neurodegenerative and oncological contexts, direct clinical or preclinical studies using IU1 in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) or in muscle-related protein aggregation disorders have not been conclusively reported (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, the mechanistic rationale derived from neurodegenerative models—with their shared pathological features such as TDP-43 protein aggregation and impaired proteostasis—is considered highly pertinent to IBM (Rinaldi et al., 2016; Qin et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, IU1 functions by binding to USP14 in a manner that does not directly compete with the catalytic substrate at the enzyme’s active site but rather targets an allosteric site located approximately 8.3 Å from the catalytic cysteine (Chakraborty et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2024). By stabilizing the autoinhibited conformation of USP14, IU1 prevents the enzyme from removing ubiquitin chains from proteins destined for degradation by the proteasome. Under normal conditions, USP14 temporarily rescues polyubiquitinated substrates by cleaving off ubiquitin chains, thereby slowing their entry into the 20S core particle and effectively reducing the overall proteolytic throughput of the UPS (LaPlante & Zhang, 2021). When IU1 inhibits this deubiquitinating activity, substrates remain polyubiquitinated for longer, which increases their recognition by the proteasome and accelerates their turnover. In various preclinical models, this enhanced proteasome activity has been shown to lead to accelerated degradation of aggregation-prone proteins, such as phosphorylated Tau and TDP-43, both of which accumulate in neurodegenerative diseases and are implicated in IBM pathology (Qin et al., 2024; VerPlank et al., 2018). The chemical interactions involve π-π stacking interactions between the benzene ring of IU1 and key protein residues (e.g., H426, Y436, and Y476 in USP14), as well as hydrophobic contacts contributed by modifications on the pyrrole or pyrrolidine rings in its analogs (Qin et al., 2024). This detailed mechanism reinforces how selective USP14 inhibition can release the proteasome from its naturally inhibitory checkpoints, thus facilitating the degradation of proteins that, when accumulated, contribute to cellular dysfunction.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis under evaluation posits that inhibition of USP14 by IU1 will enhance proteasome activity in IBM myotubes, thereby accelerating the degradation of ubiquitinated TDP-43 species, reducing the pathological aggregates, and ultimately increasing contractile force and muscle function. In IBM, misfolding and aggregation of proteins such as TDP-43 have been observed and are considered central to disease pathology (Rinaldi et al., 2016; Tran & Lee, 2022). By promoting proteasome activity through USP14 inhibition, IU1 is expected to counter these proteostatic defects. Evidence from neurodegenerative models shows that when USP14 is inhibited with IU1, proteasome activity increases and this results in improved clearance of aberrant proteins, enhanced autophagy flux, and restoration of mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis (Chakraborty et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2024). Similarly, experiments in cancer cell models indicate that IU1 enhances total protein ubiquitination, thereby facilitating the degradation of oncogenic proteins, which supports the general concept that the drug acts to reduce the levels of proteins that are normally stabilized by USP14 (Srinivasan et al., 2023). If applied to IBM myotubes, the expectation is that IU1 will lead to a decrease in the burden of ubiquitinated TDP-43 aggregates, which have been linked to decreased muscle cell contractility and muscle weakness. Given that proteasome activation is known to be beneficial in models of proteotoxic stress, enhanced clearance of aggregates could improve cellular contractile function and muscle fiber health. Preclinical indications of IU1’s ability to penetrate muscle tissue and its tolerability in murine models further support the potential for therapeutic benefit in IBM (Ma et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
IU1 represents a promising therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on its well-defined mechanistic action and preclinical evidence from related fields. Its strength lies in its ability to modulate the UPS by selectively inhibiting USP14 and thereby enhancing proteasomal degradation of aggregated proteins. The compound has demonstrated efficacy in increasing proteasome activity, improving clearance of misfolded proteins, and promoting autophagic flux in both neuronal and cancer cell models (Chakraborty et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2024; Srinivasan et al., 2023). This biochemistry is highly relevant to IBM pathology, in which the accumulation of ubiquitinated TDP-43 aggregates contributes to muscle dysfunction (Rinaldi et al., 2016; Tran & Lee, 2022). The rational design and subsequent chemical optimization of IU1, including generation of analogs with improved potency and membrane permeability, underlines its developmental feasibility (LaPlante & Zhang, 2021; Qin et al., 2024).

However, several weaknesses and challenges need careful consideration. First, while the mechanistic data from neurodegenerative and oncological models are robust, there is a paucity of direct experimental evidence showing IU1’s therapeutic efficacy in IBM or in muscle tissue specifically (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Wing, 2013). Muscle tissue presents a unique microenvironment, and the pharmacodynamics in myotubes might differ from those observed in neuronal or cancer cell models. Second, some studies hint at potential neurotoxicity of IU1 at lower concentrations, which raises concerns about dose optimization and off-target effects if similar toxicities occur in muscle or other tissues (Qin et al., 2024). Third, while preliminary ADME studies in mice suggest muscle penetration, the detailed pharmacokinetic profile, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination in muscle tissue, must be rigorously evaluated in the context of IBM, a condition that may involve altered muscle metabolism (Ma et al., 2024). Moreover, the design of IU1 as a research tool means that its transition from preclinical investigations to a clinically validated drug candidate will require extensive further optimization to ensure both efficacy and safety in long-term administration in patients with IBM.

Another critical factor is the therapeutic window; since USP14 plays an important role in normal protein homeostasis, its complete inhibition might risk perturbing normal cellular functions, particularly in highly metabolic tissues such as muscle (Chakraborty et al., 2018). The balance between enhancing proteasomal clearance of aggregated proteins and preserving sufficient DUB activity for normal cell functions is delicate and will necessitate careful titration of the dose. Additionally, while IU1’s enhancement of proteasome activity is mechanistically sound, IBM pathology is multifactorial, involving not only protein aggregation but also inflammatory components, mitochondrial dysfunction, and other cellular stress responses. Therefore, combination therapies or adjunct treatments may be needed rather than relying solely on USP14 inhibition.

In summary, IU1 as a candidate for IBM holds significant promise due to its defined mechanism of increasing proteasomal throughput and auto-activating clearance pathways that are crucial in removing toxic protein aggregates such as TDP-43. The compound’s origins in neurodegenerative disease research, along with evidence from cancer cell studies that demonstrate enhanced protein degradation, support the hypothesis that targeting USP14 can ameliorate key pathological features of IBM (Chakraborty et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2024; Srinivasan et al., 2023). Yet, the leap from these models to effective treatment of muscle diseases like IBM will require additional detailed preclinical studies focused on muscle-specific models and careful assessment of potential toxicities and pharmacokinetic properties in muscle tissue. Given IU1’s ability to modulate the ubiquitin–proteasome system, it remains a highly attractive candidate, particularly as a repurposed drug to target proteostasis defects in IBM. An intensive investigation into its effects on TDP-43 aggregates in IBM myotubes, coupled with functional assays measuring muscle contractility and longitudinal safety studies, will be critical in determining whether IU1 can be developed into a clinically viable therapeutic option for Inclusion Body Myositis (Chakraborty et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall, the strengths of IU1 include its selective inhibition of USP14, a mechanism that has been robustly demonstrated to enhance proteasomal degradation and clear aggregation-prone proteins, as well as its chemical tractability and prior optimization to improve potency and membrane permeability. Its preclinical record in neurodegeneration and cancer models provides a solid mechanistic basis for expecting similar benefits in IBM. Conversely, its weaknesses involve the lack of direct data in muscle disease models, potential safety concerns that may arise from perturbing normal proteostasis balance, and the need for comprehensive pharmacokinetic evaluation in muscle tissue. The development pathway for IU1 toward repurposing for IBM will hence hinge on establishing definitive experimental evidence that improved proteasome activity in IBM myotubes translates into meaningful reductions in pathological TDP-43 aggregates and, importantly, an increase in muscle contractile function that could ameliorate the clinical symptoms of IBM (Rinaldi et al., 2016; Tran & Lee, 2022).
