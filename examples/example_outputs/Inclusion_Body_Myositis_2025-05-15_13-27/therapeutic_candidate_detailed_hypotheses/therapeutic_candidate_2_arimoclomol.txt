Proposal for Arimoclomol

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Arimoclomol is an orally administrable small molecule developed originally as a pharmacological co‐inducer of the heat shock response. It belongs to a chemical class of hydroxylamine derivatives engineered to selectively amplify cellular stress responses via upregulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps), particularly Hsp70. Originally discovered through efforts to harness the cell’s intrinsic chaperone systems for neurodegenerative proteinopathies, arimoclomol was synthesized to enhance the natural expression of Hsps only under conditions of cellular stress; in healthy cells with low baseline Hsp activation, the drug generally produces minimal induction, thereby reducing the potential for off‐target toxicity (Kirkegaard et al., 2016; Parfitt et al., 2014). The compound’s synthesis and discovery represent a rational design strategy aimed at safely boosting proteostasis mechanisms, and its chemical properties allow for oral bioavailability and favorable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles that have been demonstrated in both preclinical and early clinical studies (Bonne, 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, arimoclomol has been evaluated extensively in neurodegenerative diseases, most notably in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where its mechanism of enhancing Hsp70 expression has shown promise in preclinical models by reducing misfolded protein aggregates and prolonging motor neuron survival (Benatar et al., 2018; Benatar et al., 2024). Several clinical trials investigating arimoclomol’s effect in ALS have established a favorable safety profile and provided preliminary evidence of target engagement, although definitive clinical efficacy has proven elusive (Benatar et al., 2024). Importantly for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), the drug has also been explored in preclinical models of IBM—both in xenograft systems and in primary myoblast cultures—where upregulation of Hsps was associated with a reduction in pathological protein aggregates such as TDP-43 and p62, as well as improvements in mitochondrial function and muscle contractility (Ahmed et al., 2016; Snedden et al., 2021). Clinical trials specifically targeting IBM have been registered (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008, 2017), and although these studies have primarily focused on safety and tolerability, trends observed in functional measures and biomarker endpoints suggest potential benefits in this patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of arimoclomol is well characterized at the molecular level. Under conditions of cellular stress, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) dissociates from its inhibitory complex and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to heat shock elements (HSEs) in the promoter regions of heat shock genes. Arimoclomol binds to a co-activator site on HSF1, thereby prolonging its activation and enhancing the transcription of inducible heat shock proteins such as Hsp70 (Ahmed et al., 2016; Kirkegaard et al., 2016). This amplification of the heat shock response enables cells to increase their chaperone capacity, which in turn facilitates the proper folding of nascent or misfolded proteins and promotes the clearance of toxic aggregates through mechanisms such as chaperone-assisted selective autophagy. In the context of Inclusion Body Myositis, where the pathological hallmarks include intracellular aggregates of TDP-43 and p62, the induced Hsp70 molecules can directly interact with these misfolded proteins, reducing their accumulation and alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (Ahmed et al., 2016; Snedden et al., 2021). Moreover, preclinical studies in mutant VCP mouse models—models that recapitulate aspects of IBM pathology—demonstrated that treatment with arimoclomol led to a reduction in ubiquitin-positive aggregates, improved mitochondrial morphology, and enhanced muscle force, indicating that the drug’s mechanism supports both protein quality control and organelle integrity (Ahmed et al., 2016; Kirkegaard et al., 2016).

Expected Effect:
The core hypothesis for the use of arimoclomol in IBM is that co-induction of heat shock proteins—particularly Hsp70—will enhance chaperone-assisted selective autophagy in IBM myotubes, leading to a reduction in the levels of toxic protein aggregates such as p62 and TDP-43. This enhancement of proteostasis is expected to restore healthy mitochondrial function in muscle cells and ultimately result in increased contractile amplitude, thereby improving muscle strength and functional performance in IBM patients (Ahmed et al., 2016; Snedden et al., 2021). There is supportive evidence that in primary rat myoblast models overexpressing pathological proteins, arimoclomol treatment significantly reduced inclusion body formation and restored normal cellular calcium homeostasis, both of which are critical for effective muscle contraction (Ahmed et al., 2016). Additionally, improvements in mitochondrial function and muscle force generation have been observed in preclinical models treated with arimoclomol, further supporting the expectation that similar benefits may be seen in IBM myotubes where mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired contractile amplitude are prominent (Snedden et al., 2021; Kirkegaard et al., 2016). Expression studies have confirmed that key molecular targets such as HSP70 and its regulatory pathways are active in IBM muscle fibers, thereby providing a biological basis for the use of arimoclomol in this context (Ahmed et al., 2016; Bonne, 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
Arimoclomol represents a promising therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis due to its unique mechanism of selectively enhancing the heat shock response—a strategy that directly addresses the pathophysiological hallmarks of IBM, namely perturbed proteostasis, toxic protein aggregate accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and muscle weakness. One of the primary strengths of arimoclomol is its demonstrated ability to upregulate Hsp70 expression in a stress-dependent manner, thereby avoiding non-specific induction in healthy cells and reducing the risk of adverse effects (Kirkegaard et al., 2016; Parfitt et al., 2014). Its oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile, as established in multiple Phase II and III trials in ALS and preliminary studies in IBM, enhance its translational potential (Benatar et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Furthermore, preclinical evidence supports the hypothesis that arimoclomol’s HSP co-induction can lead to reduced aggregates of proteins such as TDP-43 and p62—aggregates that are directly implicated in the muscle pathology of IBM—and can improve mitochondrial function and contractile properties in muscle cells (Ahmed et al., 2016; Snedden et al., 2021). The pharmacodynamic properties of arimoclomol have been characterized in both in vitro and in vivo models, and its ability to cross biological barriers, including the blood-brain barrier, underscores its potential utility beyond central nervous system disorders, extending into muscle pathologies like IBM (Benatar et al., 2018; Kirkegaard et al., 2016).

On the other hand, there are some weaknesses that must be addressed in further development. Clinical trials in ALS have shown that while arimoclomol is safe and well tolerated, the demonstrated clinical benefit has been modest or inconclusive, raising questions about dose optimization and the translation of molecular effects into meaningful functional improvements (Benatar et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2022). Additionally, trials in IBM have so far yielded trends toward slowing disease progression rather than clear-cut improvements, which may be due to the inherent heterogeneity of IBM, the slow progressive nature of the disease, or the need for longer treatment durations and more sensitive outcome measures (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017). Variability in biomarkers—for example, in HSP70 levels measured in muscle biopsies—suggests that patient stratification and robust pharmacodynamic measurement strategies will be critical in future studies (Ahmed et al., 2016; Santos et al., 2025).

Moreover, although the mechanistic rationale is compelling, the direct effects of arimoclomol on muscle contractile amplitude have primarily been shown in preclinical models, and further clinical studies with comprehensive biomarker panels and functional imaging (such as quantitative muscle MRI) are required to conclusively establish its efficacy in improving muscle strength in IBM patients (Salam et al., 2025; Snedden et al., 2021).

Overall, the strengths of arimoclomol for treating Inclusion Body Myositis include its targeted mechanism of action through selective Hsp co-induction, favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, and encouraging preclinical data demonstrating its potential to ameliorate key features of IBM such as pathological protein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction. The major limitations lie in the translation of these molecular effects into robust clinical efficacy, the need for more refined biomarkers to assess treatment response, and the heterogeneity inherent in IBM pathology that may require combination therapy or personalized approaches. Nonetheless, given the mechanistic rationale and the unmet medical need in IBM, arimoclomol remains a strong candidate for further clinical exploration, ideally in well-designed, adequately powered trials that incorporate sensitive measures of muscle function and proteostasis biomarkers (Ahmed et al., 2016; Snedden et al., 2021; Benatar et al., 2024).
