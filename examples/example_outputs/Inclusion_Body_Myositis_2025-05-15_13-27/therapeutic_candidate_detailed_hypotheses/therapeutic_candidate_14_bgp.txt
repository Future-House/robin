Proposal for BGP-15

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
BGP-15 is a small molecule, chemically defined as a hydroximic acid derivative of nicotinic acid–amidoxime. It belongs to the class of compounds known as HSP co-inducers, which function by modulating the heat shock response pathway. In particular, BGP-15 is known to facilitate the induction of heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) via activation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and to inhibit poly(AD-ribose) polymerase (PARP), thereby mitigating oxidative stress. This dual mechanism places BGP-15 in a unique category of molecules that combine chaperone co-induction with PARP inhibitory activity. The molecule was initially discovered through efforts to develop novel insulin sensitizers and has subsequently been studied for its cytoprotective actions in several models of metabolic and muscle disease (Campelj et al., 2020; Pető et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
BGP-15 has been the focus of extensive preclinical studies across a spectrum of diseases. In the realm of metabolic diseases, it has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients, with early-phase clinical trials demonstrating a favorable safety profile (Pető et al., 2020). Preclinical evidence in various muscle disease models, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy and critical illness myopathy, demonstrates that BGP-15 improves skeletal muscle function. For example, studies in dystrophic mdx mouse models and diaphragm dysfunction models have shown that BGP-15 ameliorates muscle atrophy and improves contractile force by inducing HSP72 and ameliorating proteostasis imbalance (Campelj et al., 2020; Akkad, 2018). Moreover, its PARP inhibition has been shown to reduce oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are common pathological features in many muscle-wasting conditions. Although direct studies in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) are limited, the therapeutic mechanisms underlying its benefit in other muscle pathologies—particularly those related to mitochondrial integrity and proteostasis—provide a strong rationale for repurposing BGP-15 for IBM (Pető et al., 2020; Cacciani et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
BGP-15 exerts its effect through a dual mechanism. First, it acts as a co-inducer of heat shock proteins, particularly HSP72. The induction of HSP72 is achieved by facilitating the activation and prolonged binding of HSF1 to the heat shock element (HSE), thus triggering a transcriptional response that increases HSP72 levels. HSP72 plays a critical role in maintaining cellular proteostasis by assisting in the proper protein folding, preventing misfolding and aggregation, and facilitating the refolding or removal of damaged proteins (Campelj et al., 2020; Henstridge et al., 2014). In muscle cells, increased HSP72 supports the structural integrity of contractile proteins and improves mitochondrial function through enhanced protein quality control. Second, BGP-15 inhibits PARP1, an enzyme that responds to DNA damage by consuming NAD+ and ATP, leading to energy depletion and cell death under conditions of oxidative stress. By blocking excessive PARP activation, BGP-15 preserves cellular energy stores and helps maintain mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Campelj et al., 2020; Katalin, 2019). This dual activity—simultaneous upregulation of HSP72 and inhibition of PARP—leads to an overall reduction in oxidative stress and improved mitochondrial function, which are the biochemical foundations for improving cellular proteostasis and muscle contractile function.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis driving the repurposing of BGP-15 for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is that its dual capacity to induce HSP72 and inhibit PARP will restore proper proteostasis, reduce the accumulation of protein aggregates, and normalize muscle contractility in IBM myotubes. In IBM, inefficient protein folding and accumulation of aggregated proteins contribute to muscle weakness and degeneration. It is expected that by increasing HSP72 levels, BGP-15 will enhance the folding capacity of muscle cells and promote the clearance of misfolded proteins, thereby mitigating proteotoxic stress (Cacciani et al., 2020). Moreover, by inhibiting PARP, BGP-15 is anticipated to limit excessive NAD+ consumption and oxidative damage, thus preserving mitochondrial integrity and function. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of IBM, where altered energy production and increased ROS contribute to muscle fiber damage. The expected outcome is an improvement in mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory efficiency, leading to enhanced ATP production and reduced oxidative stress, which in turn should result in normalized contractile performance in IBM myotubes. Experimental assays measuring the expression of HSP72, the activity of PARP, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS levels, and contractile parameters in myotubes derived from IBM patients would be key to validating this mechanism (Campelj et al., 2020; Pető et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
BGP-15 presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on its well-documented ability to modulate key biochemical pathways implicated in muscle degeneration. Its dual mechanism of HSP72 induction and PARP inhibition addresses both proteostasis disruption and mitochondrial dysfunction—the two major pathological features in IBM. The strengths of BGP-15 include its oral bioavailability, micromolar potency, and established safety profile from Phase II trials in metabolic diseases, which support its feasibility as a repurposed drug for IBM (Pető et al., 2020). Furthermore, its demonstrated efficacy in preclinical muscle disease models, such as dystrophic and critical illness myopathy models, suggests that similar benefits may extend to IBM, given the common molecular signatures of oxidative stress and impaired protein homeostasis observed in these conditions (Campelj et al., 2020; Cacciani et al., 2020).

However, potential weaknesses include the limited direct evidence of efficacy in IBM-specific models. Most studies available focus on other muscle pathologies, and the translation of these benefits to IBM remains hypothetical. Additionally, the complex pathophysiology of IBM—which encompasses not only proteostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction but also significant inflammatory and degenerative components—raises the possibility that BGP-15’s benefits might be partial if used as monotherapy. There is also the challenge of ensuring that the induction of HSP72 does not inadvertently interfere with other cellular stress responses in a disease that already features an overactive unfolded protein response. Finally, while the dual mechanism is a significant strength conceptually, the precise dosing regimen and long-term safety profile in the context of a chronic degenerative disease like IBM require further elucidation through dedicated preclinical studies and subsequent clinical trials (Campelj et al., 2020; Penke et al., 2018).

In summary, BGP-15’s ability to enhance HSP72 levels and inhibit PARP suggests a powerful mechanism to reduce oxidative damage and improve proteostasis, which are central to the pathogenesis of Inclusion Body Myositis. With favorable safety data from metabolic disease studies and promising results in other muscle disease models, BGP-15 offers a novel, dual-targeted approach that merits further investigation. Success in this area could lead to a significant therapeutic advance for a disease that currently lacks effective treatments. Strategic preclinical studies in IBM-relevant cell models and subsequent clinical trials will be essential to fully define its therapeutic potential and to overcome challenges related to the multifactorial nature of IBM pathology (Campelj et al., 2020; Thakur et al., 2018).
