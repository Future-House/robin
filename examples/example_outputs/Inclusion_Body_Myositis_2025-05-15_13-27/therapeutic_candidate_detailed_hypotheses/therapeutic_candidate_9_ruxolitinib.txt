Proposal for Ruxolitinib

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Ruxolitinib (marketed as Jakafi®) is a small‐molecule synthetic inhibitor originally designed and synthesized through rational drug design approaches aimed at targeting Janus kinase enzymes, specifically JAK1 and JAK2. It belongs to the class of JAK inhibitors, a well‐defined group of compounds that modulate the intracellular signaling cascades initiated by various cytokines, including interferons. Ruxolitinib is manufactured using a fully synthetic chemical process and has been optimized for oral bioavailability, robust pharmacokinetic properties, and selective inhibition of JAK1/2 catalytic activity. This compound was discovered during the development of agents to treat myeloproliferative neoplasms, where dysregulation of cytokine signaling is central to disease pathology. Over subsequent years, drugs in this class have been broadly applied in not only hematologic malignancies (such as myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera) but also in autoimmune disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus and inflammatory myopathies. Its potential to modulate pro‐inflammatory cytokine profiles, particularly those driven by interferon alpha (IFNα) and interferon gamma (IFNγ), makes ruxolitinib a promising candidate for repurposing in Inclusion Body Myositis (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2025; Hou et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Ruxolitinib has a well‐established therapeutic history in the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms, where it is used to mitigate symptoms and reduce splenomegaly owing to overactive cytokine signaling. Its use extends to several autoimmune and inflammatory conditions; for instance, preclinical studies and early-phase clinical investigations have demonstrated efficacy in conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus, where IFN-driven pathology plays a dominant role. Although IBM is traditionally considered refractory to conventional immunosuppressive therapies, emerging evidence suggests that interferon-driven mechanisms are active within IBM muscle tissue, as indicated by elevated MHC I expression and pro-inflammatory gene signatures. Clinical trial designs such as Ruxolitinib Treatment in Inclusion Body Myositis are currently investigating ruxolitinib in the context of IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2025; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Damian et al., 2022). Moreover, case reports in juvenile dermatomyositis and studies of JAK inhibitors in dermatomyositis suggest that the underlying pathological pathways modulated by interferon signaling are likely shared among inflammatory myopathies, making ruxolitinib a viable therapeutic candidate even though it has not yet been widely applied in IBM specifically (Aeschlimann et al., 2018; Ladislau et al., 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
Ruxolitinib functions through competitive inhibition of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of JAK1 and JAK2, thereby effectively blocking the phosphorylation events required for STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) protein activation. Under normal circumstances, cytokines such as IFNα and IFNγ bind to their respective receptors, triggering receptor-associated activation of JAK kinases. Activated JAKs then phosphorylate intracellular tyrosine residues on the receptor, creating docking sites for STAT proteins that become phosphorylated, dimerize, and translocate to the nucleus to initiate transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). In the context of IBM, the chronic elevation of interferon signals (both IFNα and IFNγ) drives upregulation of MHC I and other pro-inflammatory mediators in muscle fibers, leading to subsequent muscle damage, proteasome-mediated degradation of contractile proteins, and impaired myogenesis. By inhibiting JAK1/2, ruxolitinib is expected to suppress STAT phosphorylation (notably STAT1 and STAT3), thereby attenuating the transcriptional program responsible for these deleterious effects (Huang et al., 2020; Kim, 2021). Further, evidence from in vitro models of IFNγ-induced muscle atrophy demonstrates that pharmacological blockade of the JAK/STAT pathway can reverse atrophy markers and restore normal myogenic differentiation, which directly addresses the proteasome-mediated degradation and contractile dysfunction observed in IBM (Chen et al., 2021; Hou et al., 2021). Additionally, ruxolitinib’s suppression of JAK-mediated pathways may reduce the expression of E3 ubiquitin ligases—such as atrogin-1 (FBXO32) and MuRF-1 (TRIM63)—thereby inhibiting the proteasome system that contributes to the degradation of muscle proteins (Huang et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay, the hypothesis is that ruxolitinib-mediated JAK1/2 blockade will attenuate the upregulation of interferon-driven, pro-inflammatory gene expression in IBM myotubes, thereby reducing the expression of MHC I as well as cytokine-induced markers of atrophy. This is expected to translate into a decrease in the proteasome-mediated degradation of muscle structural proteins, leading to a restoration or improvement of contractile amplitude in muscle fibers. In vitro studies in related contexts have provided evidence that JAK inhibitors can reverse IFN-induced atrophy markers and improve myotube formation as well as contractile function (Shrager et al., 2024; Hou et al., 2021). Given that IBM muscle fibers exhibit a prominent IFN signature and upregulated proteasomal activity contributing to contractile dysfunction, the inhibition of JAK1/2 by ruxolitinib is predicted to normalize these aberrant cellular processes. Moreover, transcriptomic and biochemical studies indicate that pathological activation of the JAK/STAT pathway in muscle not only contributes to inflammatory gene expression but also exacerbates proteasome activity and oxidative damage to contractile machinery, which altogether diminish contractile force. Thus, the expected effect is dual: (1) a reduction of pro-inflammatory gene expression leading to improved muscle repair and regeneration, and (2) a decrease in proteasome-mediated degradation of contractile proteins, which will restore normal muscle function (Hou et al., 2021; Shrager et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2020). Additionally, studies in models of inflammatory myopathies have shown that JAK inhibition is associated with increased myotube cross-sectional area and improved electrical stimulation responses, indicating potential benefits for restoring muscle contractility (Ladislau et al., 2018).

Overall Evaluation:
Ruxolitinib presents a compelling therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on its well-characterized pharmacokinetics and established safety profile from its approved uses in myeloproliferative disorders, as well as its documented ability to modulate key inflammatory pathways implicated in autoimmune muscle diseases. One major strength of ruxolitinib is its mechanism-based approach; by selectively targeting JAK1/2, it disrupts the overactive interferon signaling that is central to IBM pathology. This mechanism of action not only has the potential to reduce the expression of inflammatory mediators and MHC I in muscle fibers but also to inhibit proteasome-mediated degradation pathways that contribute to the degeneration of contractile proteins. The preclinical data in related inflammatory myopathies and in vitro assays using human muscle cells support the notion that JAK inhibition can restore muscle integrity and function (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2025; Hou et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021). Additionally, the repurposing advantage is significant: as an already marketed drug, ruxolitinib has a well-understood dosing regimen and safety profile in adults, and its pharmacologic properties can facilitate rapid clinical translation for a new indication such as IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Damian et al., 2022).

However, several weaknesses or concerns must be addressed. Despite the mechanistic plausibility, direct clinical evidence for the efficacy of ruxolitinib in IBM remains limited; most evidence is extrapolated from studies in dermatomyositis or other interferon-driven conditions (Aeschlimann et al., 2018; Ladislau et al., 2018). IBM is a complex disorder that includes not only inflammatory but also degenerative, proteotoxic, and possibly mitochondrial components, and it is uncertain whether a single cytokine-targeting approach will be sufficient to reverse muscle weakness in this heterogeneous condition. Furthermore, potential side effects associated with JAK inhibitors, such as immunosuppression and increased infection risk, must be closely monitored in elderly IBM patients who may already have compromised health status (Moghadam-Kia & Oddis, 2022). There is also the concern that long-term inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway could interfere with normal muscle repair processes, particularly because STAT signaling has not only pathogenic but also physiological roles in muscle regeneration (Kim, 2021). From a developmental feasibility standpoint, although repurposing a marketed drug represents a substantial advantage in terms of cost and regulatory pathway, rigorous clinical trials specifically designed for IBM will be required to delineate the appropriate dosing regimen, efficacy endpoints, and long-term safety profile in this patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2025; Damian et al., 2022).

In summary, ruxolitinib’s capacity to attenuate IFNα and IFNγ-induced inflammatory signaling by blocking JAK1/2 is strongly supported by mechanistic studies and early clinical experiences in other inflammatory myopathies, providing a solid rationale for its repurposing in IBM. The candidate’s strengths lie in its targeted mechanism of action, established clinical use, and promising preclinical data that predict a reduction in proteasomal activity and restoration of muscle contractile function. Nonetheless, the limited direct evidence in IBM, potential adverse effects, and the multifactorial nature of IBM pathology represent challenges that will need to be addressed in subsequent clinical trials. Overall, considering its mechanistic specificity and favorable treatment history in related conditions, ruxolitinib is a promising candidate that warrants further investigation in preclinical IBM models and well-designed clinical studies to validate its efficacy and safety in this difficult-to-treat myopathy (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2025; Hou et al., 2021; Ladislau et al., 2018; Shrager et al., 2024; Moghadam-Kia & Oddis, 2022; Paik et al., 2022).
