Proposal for Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) is an acyclic polyisoprenoid derivative originally developed and employed as an anti‐ulcer agent in Japan and other Asian countries since the 1980s. Its chemical structure is characterized by a retinoid skeleton, and it belongs to a class of drugs capable of inducing the heat shock response (HSR). In this therapeutic class, small molecules that induce heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been repurposed from their original indications to treat diseases in which proteotoxic stress is a central pathology. GGA’s discovery arose from studies targeting gastric mucosal protection, and its later identification as a potent inducer of HSP70 shifted interest toward its utility in other conditions. The mechanism of heat shock protein induction by GGA has generated significant interest because HSP70 is a key molecular chaperone involved in protein folding, refolding misfolded proteins, and facilitating protein degradation pathways that enable the maintenance of cellular proteostasis. This biochemical property places GGA within a class of drugs that, although originally synthetic and designed for gastroprotection, are now being investigated for their potential to correct cellular protein misfolding disorders such as Inclusion Body Myositis (Zeng et al., 2018; Lanters et al., 2015).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, GGA has been used as an anti‐ulcer drug with a well‐established clinical safety profile over several decades. Its previous uses extend from gastrointestinal protection to various experimental models where its cytoprotective capabilities are linked to HSP induction. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that GGA induces HSP70 expression in several tissues including the brain, heart, liver, and skeletal muscle. For example, studies in rat models have revealed that oral GGA can cause rapid induction of HSP70 in cardiac and neural tissues, conferring protection against ischemia–reperfusion injury and other forms of cellular injury (Fujiki et al., 2006; Zeng et al., 2018). Moreover, preclinical investigations in models of cardiomyopathy and Alzheimer’s disease have shown that GGA’s ability to upregulate HSPs is associated with a reduction in pathological aggregates and improvement in tissue function (Sanbe et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2017). Although there is no direct evidence from clinical trials in IBM—as evidenced by searches on clinical trial registries that have not identified any registered investigations on GGA for IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov)—the literature draws parallels between proteotoxic stress in IBM and other degenerative conditions where GGA has already been probed, thereby supporting its repurposing potential (Spicer, 2018; Nogalska, 2009).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of action of GGA involves the activation of the heat shock transcription factor-1 (HSF1). Under basal conditions, HSF1 is maintained in an inactive state via binding to HSP70; however, GGA disrupts this inhibitory interaction, thereby freeing HSF1 to translocate into the nucleus and bind to heat shock elements (HSEs) in the promoter regions of heat shock protein genes. This results in a coordinated transcriptional upregulation of HSP70 as well as several small heat shock proteins, such as HSP27 (HSPB1) and HSPB8 (Mossiah et al., 2022; Sanbe et al., 2009). The induction of HSP70 plays a critical role by enhancing the cellular capacity to refold misfolded proteins and facilitating the clearance of protein aggregates through interactions with the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy pathways. In models of protein aggregation diseases, HSP70 induction has been correlated with reductions in pathological inclusions such as p62-positive vacuoles, which are a marker of impaired autophagic flux and proteotoxic stress (Spicer, 2018; Nogalska, 2009). Moreover, in cardiomyopathy models, GGA has been shown to also upregulate small HSPs like HSPB8, which directly inhibit amyloid oligomer formation and mitigate apoptosis by interfering with mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activation (Sanbe et al., 2009). A further layer of complexity is provided by evidence that GGA can modulate intracellular signaling pathways such as ERK/p38 MAPK, which have been implicated in both neuronal survival and protein homeostasis, thereby contributing to the clearance of toxic aggregates (Sun et al., 2017). This multi‐faceted mechanism—combining release and activation of HSF1, induction of HSP70 and small HSPs, and subsequent improvements in protein folding capacity and aggregate clearance—forms the biochemical foundation for hypothesizing that GGA may alleviate cellular proteotoxic stress in IBM myotubes (Mossiah et al., 2022; Spicer, 2018).

Expected Effect:
The working hypothesis regarding GGA’s therapeutic potential in IBM is based on its capacity to induce HSP70 upregulation and thereby reduce the burden of misfolded proteins that accumulate in inclusion bodies. In an experimental setting using IBM myotubes, it is expected that treatment with GGA will increase HSP70 levels, as has been observed in various preclinical muscle and cardiac models. The increase in HSP70 should in turn facilitate the refolding of denatured proteins, promote the degradation of irreversibly misfolded proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy, and ultimately reduce the formation or persistence of p62-positive autophagic vacuoles—a key histopathological hallmark of IBM (Spicer, 2018; Nogalska, 2009). In addition, the enhanced proteostasis is anticipated to improve muscle fiber health and thereby potentiate improvements in contractile amplitude. HSP70 and its associated chaperones play a documented role in preserving the integrity of the contractile apparatus, as evidenced by their localization at myofilaments in cardiac tissues following GGA treatment (van Marion et al., 2020; Hoogstra-Berends et al., 2012). Given that similar mechanisms of proteotoxicity and disturbed autophagy are central to the pathogenesis of IBM, it is reasonable to expect that GGA could exert comparable protective effects in skeletal muscle. The anticipated outcome is a multi-pronged cellular benefit: reduced proteotoxic stress due to fewer aggregations of misfolded proteins, diminished p62-positive vacuole accumulation due to improved autophagic clearance, and enhanced muscle contractile function as a result of stabilized sarcomere integrity and improved mitochondrial function (Spicer, 2018; Zeng et al., 2018). Furthermore, the ability of GGA to act via modulation of HSF1 activity and its well-documented safety profile after oral dosing underpin the hypothesis that therapeutic levels of HSP70 can be achieved in myotubes to yield these beneficial effects (Mossiah et al., 2022; Fujiki et al., 2006).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, Geranylgeranylacetone represents a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis, primarily due to its capacity to induce HSP70 and related chaperones, thereby alleviating proteotoxic stress—a central pathogenic feature of IBM. The candidate drug is well distinguished by several strong attributes. First, its class history as an anti‐ulcer agent with decades of clinical safety and oral bioavailability supports its tolerability and feasibility for repurposing (Zeng et al., 2018; Fujiki et al., 2006). Second, preclinical studies in models of cardiomyopathy and neurodegeneration have consistently shown that GGA upregulates HSP70 and small HSPs, leading to reduced protein aggregation, improved cellular survival, and functional recovery in tissues exposed to proteotoxic stress (Sanbe et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2017). Third, the biochemical mechanism—centered on modulating HSF1 activity to promote HSP transcription—has robust support across diverse tissues and disease models, providing a clear rationale for its activity in muscle cells, which are known to express HSP70 abundantly under stress conditions (Spicer, 2018; Mossiah et al., 2022). With respect to the proposed hypothesis that GGA-induced HSP70 upregulation will alleviate proteotoxic stress in IBM myotubes, reduce p62-positive vacuoles, and enhance contractile amplitude, the supporting evidence is encouraging yet largely indirect. While there is substantive evidence from cardiac and neurodegenerative models that HSP induction correlates with reduced protein aggregation and improved cellular function, direct evidence for these effects in IBM or skeletal muscle models remains to be generated (Spicer, 2018; Nogalska, 2009). In this context, a key weakness lies in the absence of targeted preclinical studies explicitly testing GGA’s efficacy in IBM-specific models, including quantitative assessment of p62-positive vacuole diminution and direct measurements of contractile performance. This gap presents an opportunity for rigorous experimental investigation in vitro using IBM patient-derived myotubes as well as in vivo models that recapitulate the proteostasis defects observed in IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Another potential challenge is related to pharmacokinetic considerations. Although GGA has demonstrated good oral bioavailability and systemic distribution in other tissues, the extent to which effective concentrations are achieved and sustained in skeletal muscle tissue of IBM patients will require empirical determination (Wang et al., 2014; van Marion et al., 2020). Additionally, the biochemical specificity of HSP induction may vary across tissue types, and while muscle cells are known to express HSP70 upon stress, the modulation of autophagic pathways (reflected by p62 clearance) and the functional recovery of contractile amplitude will need to be validated in muscle-specific contexts. The candidate’s novelty is supported by the innovative repurposing of a well-known gastroprotective agent into a therapeutic strategy for a largely intractable and debilitating myopathy, which currently lacks effective disease-modifying treatments (Spicer, 2018; Guglielmi et al., 2024).

In conclusion, Geranylgeranylacetone exhibits multiple strengths as a potential therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis. Its established safety profile from decades of clinical use as an anti-ulcer drug, combined with robust preclinical evidence supporting its role in upregulating HSP70 and mitigating proteotoxic stress, underpins its developmental feasibility for IBM. The proposed mechanism of action via HSF1 activation and HSP induction is well documented in the literature and directly addresses key pathological features of IBM, namely the accumulation of misfolded proteins and dysfunctional autophagy marked by p62-positive vacuoles, while also potentially enhancing muscle contractility. However, significant preclinical validation in IBM-specific models is still required to verify the expected molecular and functional outcomes in muscle tissue. Overall, while there remain gaps in direct evidence, the compelling mechanistic rationale and favorable pharmacokinetic and safety attributes of GGA render it a promising candidate for further investigation in the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis (Spicer, 2018; Mossiah et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov).
