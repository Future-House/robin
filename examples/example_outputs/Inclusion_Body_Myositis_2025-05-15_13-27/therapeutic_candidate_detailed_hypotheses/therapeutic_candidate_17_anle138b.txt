Proposal for Anle138b

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Anle138b is a synthetic small‐molecule compound that belongs to the diphenyl‐pyrazole (DPP) derivative class. It was discovered through high-throughput screening approaches—specifically, scanning for intensely fluorescent targets (SIFT)—and then optimized medicinally for efficacy against pathological oligomer formation (Wagner et al., 2013; Deeg et al., 2015). Chemically, its structure is defined as 3-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-5-(3-bromophenyl)-1H-pyrazole, and this design enables it to cross biological barriers including the blood–brain barrier. Compounds in this chemical class have been broadly utilized as aggregation inhibitors in neurodegenerative conditions to interfere with toxic oligomeric species rather than targeting monomeric proteins or mature fibrils (Wagner et al., 2013; Gillman, 2015). The compound’s synthesis involves modular chemical modifications that enhance hydrophobic interactions with oligomer interfaces, and its intrinsic fluorescence properties further enable direct molecular binding studies (Wagner et al., 2013). Overall, Anle138b is representative of a new generation of targeted therapies aimed at modulating protein aggregation—a mechanism relevant not only to central nervous system disorders but also, as hypothesized here, to neuromuscular diseases such as Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Anle138b has been extensively studied in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly those characterized by pathogenic protein aggregation. Preclinical studies have shown that this oligomer modulator can inhibit the progression of diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy (MSA), tauopathies, and prion diseases by targeting toxic oligomeric species (Wagner et al., 2013; Heras-Garvin et al., 2019). In animal models, administration of Anle138b has resulted in reduced aggregation of alpha-synuclein, decreased neurodegeneration, improved motor performance, and delayed disease progression even when the treatment was initiated after onset of pathology (Heras-Garvin et al., 2019; Gillman, 2015). Clinical trials such as NCT04208152 and NCT04685265, conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with Parkinson's disease, have further evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability of Anle138b, establishing a favorable safety profile and oral bioavailability (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020). Despite this robust work in neurodegeneration, there is no direct evidence in the current literature of Anle138b being used to treat myopathies or Inclusion Body Myositis specifically; however, its mechanism of inhibiting oligomerization is mechanistically relevant to IBM because IBM muscle fibers display pathological protein aggregates, including TDP-43 and β-amyloid, which contribute to degeneration (Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014; Guglielmi et al., 2024). The therapeutic history of the compound provides precedent for its repurposing into new indications where protein misfolding and aggregation are central pathogenic features.

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of action of Anle138b involves binding to hydrophobic interfaces present in pathogenic protein oligomers. Detailed biochemical studies have demonstrated that it interacts preferentially with aggregated forms of proteins such as alpha-synuclein, tau, and beta-amyloid, without affecting the normal monomeric species (Wagner et al., 2013; Carolina, 2020). This selective binding disrupts the normal aggregation pathway, thereby inhibiting the formation of toxic oligomer species. The compound achieves this by engaging at the hydrophobic oligomer interface, which is crucial in maintaining the structure of these toxic assemblies (Wagner et al., 2013). Experimental studies have shown that such modulation not only prevents further aggregation but can also facilitate a remodeling of existing aggregates into non-toxic, smaller species (Wagner et al., 2015). Additional mechanistic insights provided by recent bioinformatics and structural studies indicate that Anle138b may have pleiotropic effects, including potential modulation of intracellular pathways such as cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory signaling cascades, although its primary effect remains its direct interaction with oligomeric proteins (Hosseini-Gerami et al., 2023; Hosseini-Gerami, 2022). The compound’s mode of action is especially relevant for proteins like TDP-43 and β-amyloid, which have been implicated in the pathology of Inclusion Body Myositis; TDP-43 aggregation is a hallmark of IBM pathology and its inhibition could lead to preservation of cellular structure and function (Sidoryk-Węgrzynowicz et al., 2024; Guerrero-Muñoz et al., 2014). Such molecular interactions suggest that Anle138b operates via a direct and structure-dependent mechanism to modulate oligomer assembly, thereby reducing aggregate-driven toxicity.

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing Anle138b in IBM is that it will inhibit the oligomerization of misfolded proteins, particularly TDP-43 and β-amyloid, within IBM myotubes. IBM is characterized by the accumulation of these proteins leading to sarcomere disruption and impaired contractility (Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014; Guglielmi et al., 2024). In vitro studies in other contexts have demonstrated that Anle138b reduces protein aggregation, and the expectation is that similar effects will be observed in muscle cells. Specifically, by preventing the formation of TDP-43 and amyloid aggregates in myotubes, the compound should preserve the structural integrity of the sarcomere—the fundamental unit of muscle contraction—and thus improve contractile function (Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014; Guglielmi et al., 2024). Gene expression studies have confirmed that proteins such as TDP-43 and β-amyloid are indeed expressed in muscle fibers, and in the context of IBM, these aggregates lead to muscle weakness and degeneration (Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014; Guerrero-Muñoz et al., 2014). In the proposed assay, one expects that treatment with Anle138b will result in a measurable reduction in aggregate load, restoration of sarcomere architecture, and enhanced contractility in cultured IBM myotubes. This effect would be mediated by the compound’s ability to block the early oligomerization events that set the stage for the subsequent formation of larger, more toxic aggregates, thereby preserving cellular function (Carolina, 2020; Wagner et al., 2013).

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating Anle138b as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis, several strengths are evident. First, the compound has demonstrated broad-spectrum efficacy in multiple protein aggregation disorders, with a mechanism of action that directly targets the hydrophobic interfaces of toxic oligomers, which is mechanistically relevant to IBM pathology (Wagner et al., 2013; Gillman, 2015). The preclinical safety profile, along with extensive pharmacokinetic data from Phase 1 studies in neurodegenerative conditions, supports its feasibility for oral administration and long-term treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022). Additionally, the fact that Anle138b has already passed several early clinical trials in neurodegeneration demonstrates that it is well tolerated in humans, potentially allowing accelerated repurposing for IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020).

The primary weakness, however, lies in the absence of direct evidence from IBM models or clinical trials in myopathic tissues. While there is strong mechanistic rationale for its use given the commonality of protein aggregation in neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders, IBM has its own unique inflammatory and degenerative components that may not fully recapitulate the conditions present in central nervous system diseases (Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014; Guglielmi et al., 2024). Moreover, the repurposing hypothesis relies on the assumption that TDP-43 and β-amyloid aggregates in IBM muscle are amenable to modulation by Anle138b in a manner similar to alpha-synuclein or tau aggregates in brain tissue. This remains to be validated experimentally. Additional concerns include the potential differences in tissue penetration and intracellular compartmentalization in muscle cells compared to neurons, which may impact the effective concentration of the drug at the target sites within IBM myotubes (Carolina, 2020; Heras-Garvin et al., 2019).

Another point to consider is the complexity of IBM pathology which involves both degenerative protein aggregation and an inflammatory milieu. While Anle138b’s ability to modulate toxic oligomers is its main strength, IBM also involves inflammatory cytokine signaling and impaired proteostasis pathways that might require a combinatorial therapeutic approach. Thus, while replacing or complementing current immunomodulatory therapies with an anti-aggregation strategy is promising, it may necessitate further preclinical studies to determine whether integrating Anle138b into multi-targeted regimens yields significant clinical benefit (Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014; Guglielmi et al., 2024).

In summary, the overall evaluation of Anle138b as a repurposed treatment candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis is cautiously optimistic. The compound's robust preclinical and early clinical profile in neurodegenerative diseases—characterized by its targeted inhibition of pathological oligomer formation—strongly supports its potential mechanism of benefit in IBM, where similar protein aggregation processes are pathognomonic. Its strengths include well-defined molecular targets, oral bioavailability, established safety, and a mechanism of action that directly addresses the aggregation of proteins such as TDP-43 and β-amyloid. However, significant preclinical validation in IBM-specific models is needed to confirm its efficacy in muscle tissue, to address potential differences in tissue-specific pharmacokinetics and dynamics, and to assess its impact on both degeneration and the associated inflammatory components of IBM. Moving forward, it would be advisable to undertake detailed in vitro studies using IBM myotubes and in vivo animal models of IBM to generate evidence supporting its repurposing before proceeding to a targeted clinical trial in IBM patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014).
