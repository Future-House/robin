Proposal for SMER28

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SMER28 is a synthetic small molecule originally discovered through phenotypic screening designed to identify enhancers of autophagy that act independently of canonical mTOR inhibition (Floto et al., 2007). Its development involved screening chemical libraries for compounds that increased autophagic flux without eliciting the broad immunosuppressive effects commonly associated with rapamycin. The molecule belongs to a class of autophagy enhancers, specifically those that modulate autophagy via activation of the beclin-1/VPS34 complex, rather than through mTOR-dependent pathways (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022). The synthetic origins of SMER28 are well established; it is synthesized via multi-step organic pathways that have been optimized to yield an active scaffold, with accessible chemical modifications that allow for structure–activity relationship studies. This molecular scaffold is part of a broader class of compounds—SMERs (Small Molecule Enhancers of Rapamycin)—which have been used in numerous cellular and animal models to promote the autophagic clearance of misfolded or aggregate-prone proteins, and have been investigated across multiple disease indications including neurodegeneration (Sarkar et al., 2007; Floto et al., 2007).

Therapeutic History:
SMER28 has garnered attention primarily for its preclinical efficacy in cellular models of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Huntington’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. In cellular studies, SMER28 was shown to enhance autophagic flux and promote the clearance of aggregation-prone proteins such as mutant huntingtin and α-synuclein, with concomitant reductions in cell toxicity (Sarkar et al., 2007; Sarkar & Rubinsztein, 2008). In Drosophila models, the administration of SMER28 resulted in a significant decrease in mutant protein aggregation and associated neurodegeneration, thereby demonstrating its potential in mitigating proteotoxicity (Floto et al., 2007). Moreover, biochemical studies have shown that SMER28 can induce autophagy without altering mTOR signaling parameters, thus ensuring a targeted enhancement of autophagic pathways with minimal off-target immune suppression (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022; Koukourakis et al., 2018). Although the majority of the published work centers on neuronal and non-muscle models, there is emerging preclinical evidence in non-neuronal systems as well. For instance, a study investigating radioprotection in mouse bone marrow and liver demonstrated that SMER28 can protect normal tissues from radiation-induced damage through the activation of autophagy (Koukourakis et al., 2018). However, to date, there is no direct clinical or preclinical report that applies SMER28 in the context of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) or other protein aggregate myopathies. Its potential use in IBM remains a novel proposition that leverages its established mechanism of aggregate clearance in other disease models (Doulatov et al., 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism by which SMER28 exerts its effects centers on its ability to enhance autophagic flux independently of mTOR—a property that distinguishes it from rapamycin and its analogues. At the molecular level, SMER28 is reported to act by modulating the activity of the beclin-1/VPS34 complex. This complex is critical for the initiation of autophagosome formation since VPS34 is a class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase that generates PI(3)P, a lipid essential for nucleating the formation of autophagosomal membranes (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022; Sarkar et al., 2007). SMER28 enhances the assembly or activity of the VPS34 complex, thereby resulting in an increase in the formation of autophagosomes independent of conventional mTOR signaling. In addition, there is evidence that SMER28 directly interacts with components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, with studies demonstrating that it can inhibit specific isoforms of the catalytic subunit of PI3K (p110δ, with moderate effects on p110γ), further contributing to the attenuation of downstream mTOR signaling and growth factor responses (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022). This direct inhibition of PI3K contrasts with the indirect mTOR inhibition exerted by rapamycin, and it may account for additional cytostatic effects such as G1 phase cell cycle arrest observed in certain cell types (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022). Furthermore, recent structural studies suggest that SMER28 may also bind to the VCP/p97 complex, stimulating the D1 ATPase activity of VCP, which plays a dual role in governing both autophagic and proteasomal degradation of aggregate-prone proteins (Wrobel et al., 2023). This dual mechanism—i.e., enhancing autophagosome formation via beclin-1/VPS34 activation and promoting aggregate clearance through VCP-mediated proteostasis—provides a robust biochemical rationale for its efficacy in models of protein aggregation. The specificity for pathogenic protein aggregates is further highlighted by data demonstrating that SMER28 preferentially targets misfolded or mutant proteins while sparing their wild-type counterparts, a selectivity that is critical in avoiding undesired degradation of normal cellular proteins (Wrobel et al., 2022).

Expected Effect in IBM Myotubes:
The underlying hypothesis for repurposing SMER28 in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is based on its capacity to synergize with basal autophagy pathways in muscle cells to promote the clearance of pathological protein aggregates, specifically those contained within rimmed vacuoles. IBM is characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates, impaired autophagic flux, and consequent muscle fiber degeneration, which ultimately leads to contractile dysfunction of myotubes (Castets et al., 2016; Li et al., 2022). The expected therapeutic effect of SMER28 in IBM would be twofold. First, by enhancing autophagosome formation via activation of the beclin-1/VPS34 complex, SMER28 should increase the clearance rate of misfolded proteins and aggregates that accumulate in IBM. This is supported by preclinical evidence in neuronal models where SMER28 effectively reduced mutant protein aggregation and improved cellular viability (Sarkar et al., 2007; Floto et al., 2007). Second, in IBM myotubes—which express autophagy markers such as LC3 and p62 and exhibit impaired autophagic flux—SMER28 is anticipated to restore autophagy-mediated proteostasis thereby reducing the buildup of rimmed vacuole contents and, consequently, rescuing the contractile function of the muscle fibers. The biochemical rationale is further reinforced by studies demonstrating that other autophagy inducers have shown benefits in muscle disease models; for example, carbamazepine has been shown to activate autophagy via an mTOR-independent route, leading to improvements in muscle pathology in the SOD1-G93A mouse model (Zhang et al., 2018). Although that study focuses on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, it provides a conceptual parallel whereby mTOR-independent autophagy activation results in improved muscle function. Given that SMER28 acts through similar molecular mechanisms—enhancing autophagic flux via beclin-1/VPS34 and potentially modulating PI3K pathways—it is plausible that patient-derived IBM myotubes would show improved sarcomere integrity and contractile function upon treatment. Furthermore, the expression of key autophagy regulators in muscle cells, including beclin-1, ATG5/7, and VPS34, supports the notion that SMER28’s mechanism is operative in myotubes (Li et al., 2022; Pontifex, 2025). Thus, the expected effect is an improvement in myotube function through accelerated clearance of pathological protein aggregates and restoration of normal intracellular proteostasis.

Overall Evaluation:
SMER28 presents as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in Inclusion Body Myositis due to its unique mechanism of action and preclinical efficacy in models of protein aggregation. Its strengths include a well-established synthetic route and chemical scaffold, which provides avenues for further chemical optimization and structure–activity relationship studies (Floto et al., 2007; Koukourakis et al., 2018). The molecule’s ability to enhance autophagy independently of mTOR is particularly valuable given that mTOR inhibition can have broad systemic effects that are undesirable in chronic treatment settings. Instead, SMER28 specifically activates the beclin-1/VPS34 complex, thereby increasing autophagosomal biogenesis and promoting the clearance of toxic protein aggregates known to accumulate in IBM (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022; Sarkar et al., 2007). Furthermore, its capacity to directly inhibit the PI3K p110δ isoform and potentially modulate VCP/p97 activity provides a dual mechanism that may enhance both autophagic and proteasomal degradation pathways, ensuring a more comprehensive clearance of proteotoxic species (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022; Wrobel et al., 2023).

The translation of these mechanistic effects to the setting of IBM is compelling because the pathology of IBM revolves around the accumulation of rimmed vacuoles filled with aggregated proteins and the subsequent impairment of muscle fiber function (Castets et al., 2016; Li et al., 2022). By clearing these aggregates, SMER28 could not only restore cellular homeostasis but also potentially improve contractile function in patient-derived myotubes, addressing a key unmet need in IBM treatment. In addition, preliminary ADME and toxicity profiling in rodent models indicate that SMER28 is well tolerated at efficacious concentrations, although further detailed pharmacological profiling is necessary to ascertain its safety in long-term clinical use, especially in the context of chronic muscle diseases (Doulatov et al., 2017; Kirchenwitz et al., 2022).

However, several challenges and weaknesses must be considered. First, while extensive preclinical data exist in neuronal and non-muscle models, there is no direct evidence so far of SMER28’s efficacy in muscle cells, myotubes, or animal models of protein aggregate myopathies or Inclusion Body Myositis. Such proof-of-concept studies in muscle-specific models are essential before advancing SMER28 into clinical trials for IBM (Pontifex, 2025; Li et al., 2022). Second, although the mechanism of action is well characterized in terms of autophagy enhancement, the potential interplay with other cellular pathways active in muscle cells—such as those governing calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial dynamics, and sarcomeric organization—remains to be explored in detail. These interactions could influence the overall efficacy and safety profile of SMER28 in muscle tissue. Third, the dosage and potential cytostatic effects observed in some in vitro studies (as indicated by G1 cell cycle arrest in certain cell types) might raise concerns regarding long-term exposure in muscle cells, which are terminally differentiated and unlikely to proliferate but may nonetheless suffer functional alterations if the drug’s concentration is not carefully optimized (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022).

In summary, SMER28 offers several attractive features as a therapeutic candidate for IBM. Its mTOR-independent activation of autophagy via the beclin-1/VPS34 complex, combined with modulatory effects on PI3K and VCP/p97 pathways, provides a well-supported mechanistic basis for clearing pathogenic protein aggregates. These attributes, alongside preliminary evidence of efficacy in neurodegenerative models and advantageous synthetic features, justify its further investigation in IBM-specific preclinical models. However, the translational potential of SMER28 in IBM will hinge on rigorous studies in muscle cell models—including patient-derived myotubes—and appropriate animal models of protein aggregate myopathies to confirm that the compound can indeed rescue contractile dysfunction and restore muscle fiber homeostasis without inducing deleterious side effects. Given these considerations, SMER28 is a strong candidate warranting further preclinical evaluation as a repurposed drug for Inclusion Body Myositis, with its novel mTOR-independent mechanism representing a significant advance over existing autophagy modulators (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022; Vantaggiato et al., 2023; Wrobel et al., 2023).
