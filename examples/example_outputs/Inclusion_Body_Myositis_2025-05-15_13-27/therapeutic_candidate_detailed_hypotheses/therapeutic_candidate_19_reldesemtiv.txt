Proposal for Reldesemtiv (CK-2127107)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Reldesemtiv (CK-2127107) is a synthetic small-molecule fast skeletal troponin activator that was discovered and optimized through contemporary high-throughput screening and medicinal chemistry efforts by Cytokinetics in collaboration with Astellas Pharma (Alsulami & Marston, 2020). It belongs to a novel class of compounds that modulate the contractile machinery of skeletal muscle by selectively binding to the troponin complex in fast skeletal fibers. Unlike traditional drugs that target neural transmission or systemic anabolic pathways, fast skeletal troponin activators such as reldesemtiv directly enhance the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to calcium ions, thereby increasing force production in muscle fibers even under conditions of suboptimal stimulation (Andrews et al., 2018). This chemical class comprises molecules designed to work at the level of the sarcomere—the fundamental contractile unit of striated muscle—and has been leveraged previously for neuromuscular disorders where muscle weakness is a predominant clinical feature, demonstrating the potential to restore or amplify muscle function in various disease settings (Calder et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
The fast skeletal troponin activator class has a well-developed therapeutic history, with compounds such as tirasemtiv—the first generation member—being extensively evaluated in neuromuscular diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myasthenia gravis, and models of heart failure; these studies have provided critical insight into the feasibility of modulating muscle contractility via troponin activation (Hansen et al., 2014; Alsulami & Marston, 2020). Reldesemtiv itself is regarded as a next-generation candidate with improvements over earlier drugs; it has progressed through phase 1 clinical studies in healthy volunteers, demonstrating dose-dependent increases in muscle force production, and has been explored in phase 2 clinical studies in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients (Rudnicki et al., 2021; Andrews et al., 2018). Although no clinical trials have yet been reported specifically in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), the extensive evaluation of reldesemtiv and related compounds in other neuromuscular diseases underpins the notion that enhancing contractility on a molecular level could provide symptomatic benefits in a wide variety of muscle weakness disorders, including IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Alsulami & Marston, 2020). Preclinical rodent studies have shown that fast skeletal troponin activators improve exercise tolerance and delay fatigue in disease models that exhibit muscle atrophy and dysfunction (Hwee et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2019), which supports their potential repurposing for IBM—a condition characterized by progressive muscle weakness and contractile impairment (McCord, 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
On a molecular level, reldesemtiv functions by binding to the fast skeletal troponin complex with high specificity, thereby increasing its sensitivity to Ca²⁺ ions (Calder et al., 2016; Hwang & Sykes, 2015). The troponin complex in fast skeletal muscle comprises three subunits: troponin C (TnC), troponin I (TnI), and troponin T (TnT). Reldesemtiv interacts predominantly with troponin C, slowing the dissociation rate of Ca²⁺ from the low-affinity sites, which effectively prolongs the duration that the troponin complex remains in its calcium-bound, activatable conformation (Issahaku et al., 2023). This results in a leftward shift in the force–calcium (force–pCa) relationship in isolated fast skeletal muscle fibers, meaning that at any given submaximal Ca²⁺ concentration, a greater contractile force is generated (Andrews et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2019). Detailed molecular dynamics simulations have revealed that reldesemtiv binds with a free energy of approximately −41.30 kcal/mol to a specific pocket in the troponin C subunit, with key interacting residues in the neighboring regions of troponin I contributing to binding stabilization through van der Waals and electrostatic interactions (Issahaku et al., 2023). Importantly, reldesemtiv demonstrates high selectivity for fast skeletal muscle troponin over the isoforms expressed in slow-twitch and cardiac muscle, which minimizes the risk of off-target cardiac effects—a significant consideration in the development of muscle activators (Hwang & Sykes, 2015; Andrews et al., 2018). At the functional level, reldesemtiv increases the amplitude of muscle contractions by enhancing the formation of actin-myosin cross-bridges and increasing the time spent in the force-producing state during a contraction cycle, a process that translates to greater muscle strength and improved endurance, especially under conditions of fatigue (Hwee et al., 2015; Rudnicki et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
The working hypothesis for reldesemtiv in the context of IBM is that selective activation of fast skeletal troponin will increase calcium sensitivity in IBM myotubes, thereby compensating for intrinsic contractile deficits despite the underlying proteostasis defects characteristic of IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In vitro assays with IBM patient-derived myotubes are expected to show that, upon treatment with reldesemtiv, submaximal electrical stimulation leads to a significant increase in force generation compared to untreated controls (Andrews et al., 2018; Rudnicki et al., 2021). Given that IBM involves progressive inflammation, protein aggregation, and muscle fiber degeneration, the symptomatic deficit primarily lies in reduced contractile performance; enhancing the contractility even in a background of proteostasis imbalance could lead to measurable improvements in muscle strength and endurance. Preclinical rodent studies in other disease models have demonstrated that reldesemtiv enhances exercise tolerance by increasing muscle force output and reducing fatigability under repetitive stimulation conditions (Hwee et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2019). In addition, because the fast skeletal troponin complex is expressed in the affected muscle fibers of IBM patients (McCord, 2023), reldesemtiv’s mechanism of directly modulating this complex should be operational in IBM myotubes. Furthermore, the oral bioavailability and favorable pharmacokinetic profile of reldesemtiv, confirmed in healthy volunteers and SMA patients, suggests that therapeutically effective plasma concentrations can be achieved without incurring significant toxicity or adverse effects (Rudnicki et al., 2021; Andrews et al., 2018). Overall, the expected effect in an IBM setting is a direct improvement in muscle contractility, leading to enhanced functional outcomes—such as improved grip strength, walking distance, and reduced fatigue—that may translate into a better quality of life for patients, even if the underlying inflammatory pathology of IBM continues to progress (Alsulami & Marston, 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, the comprehensive literature review indicates that reldesemtiv shows considerable promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for the treatment of IBM based on its well-characterized mechanism of action, robust safety and pharmacokinetic profile, and demonstrated efficacy in augmenting skeletal muscle contractility in other neuromuscular disease contexts. One of the main strengths of reldesemtiv is its selective modulation of the fast skeletal troponin complex, which has been shown to enhance calcium sensitivity and prolong actin-myosin cross-bridge formation, thereby directly amplifying muscle contraction without impacting cardiac muscle (Calder et al., 2016; Hwang & Sykes, 2015). This mechanistic approach is highly relevant for IBM, where muscle weakness is a prominent clinical feature and the contractile machinery, although compromised by proteostasis defects, may still respond to enhancements in calcium sensitivity (McCord, 2023). Additionally, reldesemtiv’s oral formulation and its advancement into advanced clinical trials in diseases such as ALS and SMA underscore its developmental feasibility and potential to achieve regulatory approval in the near future (Rudnicki et al., 2021; Andrews et al., 2018).

However, there are also clear weaknesses and limitations. A significant concern is the lack of direct preclinical or clinical data demonstrating efficacy specifically in IBM. Although preclinical studies in rodent models of heart failure and other neuromuscular conditions have been promising (Hwee et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2019), IBM has unique pathological features such as chronic inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and protein misfolding, which may not be fully addressed by simply enhancing contractility (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ochala & Sun, 2016). Moreover, while reldesemtiv has proved safe in healthy individuals and in patients with other neuromuscular disorders, the altered muscle environment in IBM could potentially modify its efficacy or safety profile; for instance, prolonged calcium binding might affect muscle relaxation kinetics adversely in a diseased muscle milieu (Hwang & Sykes, 2015). Furthermore, IBM is characterized by multifactorial pathology involving inflammation, degeneration, and immune-mediated mechanisms, so a therapeutic that acts solely on contractile enhancement may only provide symptomatic relief rather than halting disease progression (Alsulami & Marston, 2020).

From a biochemical standpoint, the detailed molecular dynamics and binding studies (Issahaku et al., 2023) confirm that reldesemtiv engages its target with high affinity and selectivity, which bodes well for its mechanistic effectiveness in enhancing muscle contractility. However, this same specificity necessitates critical evaluation in the context of IBM, where the extent of muscle fiber damage and proteostatic stress might limit the potential for functional recovery even if contractility is transiently enhanced (Andrews et al., 2018). It is also essential to consider that any improvement in contractility may need to be sustained over long periods, and the chronic use of such activators in a slowly progressive disease like IBM requires careful long-term safety studies.

In conclusion, reldesemtiv represents a highly promising candidate to address a significant unmet medical need in IBM by directly enhancing skeletal muscle contractility—a strategy that bypasses upstream pathologic processes to provide symptomatic relief. The strengths of this candidate include its advanced clinical development stage in related neuromuscular diseases, robust pharmacodynamic effects mediated by selective binding to fast skeletal troponin, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and the theoretical rationale that improving calcium sensitivity can augment force production in weakened muscle fibers (Andrews et al., 2018; Rudnicki et al., 2021). Conversely, its weaknesses include the absence of direct efficacy data in IBM, potential challenges in translating improvements in contractility into meaningful functional outcomes in the face of proteostasis defects, and the need to further examine long-term safety in a population with chronic muscle inflammation and degeneration (Alsulami & Marston, 2020; Hwang & Sykes, 2015). Given the complexity of IBM pathology, reldesemtiv may be best leveraged as part of a combinatorial therapeutic approach that not only enhances contractility but also addresses inflammatory and degenerative aspects of the disease. Overall, while further preclinical studies in IBM-specific models and dedicated clinical trials will be essential to validate efficacy, the mechanistic rationale and therapeutic history of reldesemtiv strongly support its consideration as a promising repurposed candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hansen et al., 2014).
