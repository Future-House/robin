Proposal for MCC950

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MCC950 is a synthetic small molecule that was discovered during medicinal chemistry efforts targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome. It belongs to the diaryl sulfonylurea class of compounds, a structural subclass originally exemplified by glyburide, which was later repurposed and optimized for high potency and selectivity against NLRP3. The compound is typically synthesized via multi‐step organic synthesis procedures involving diaryl sulfonylurea motifs, with chemical modifications designed to optimize binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3. Its discovery was driven by the need to block IL-1β maturation in inflammatory diseases through direct inhibition of inflammasome assembly. As a chemical scaffold, MCC950 represents the archetype of small molecule NLRP3 inhibitors that have been extensively used as both mechanistic probes in vitro and potential therapeutic agents in in vivo disease models (Coll et al., 2015; Coll et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
MCC950 has a robust preclinical history and has been evaluated in a wide range of inflammatory models. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that MCC950 effectively prevents excessive IL-1β and IL-18 secretion by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation in models of multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, and other inflammatory conditions. In various animal models, including those of muscle inflammation, MCC950 has shown efficacy in reducing pyroptosis and limiting tissue damage. Its pharmacokinetic profile, including oral bioavailability and a reasonable half-life, has supported its transition into early-phase clinical studies as a potential anti-inflammatory agent. Although MCC950 has been primarily evaluated for conditions such as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes and neuroinflammatory disorders, there is emerging evidence from rodent studies that pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 can ameliorate muscle inflammatory pathology. Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is characterized by chronic muscle inflammation and degenerative changes, and the rationale here is that by repurposing MCC950, it may be possible to directly dampen inflammasome‐driven IL-1β maturation, thereby improving muscle proteostasis and contractility. Yet, direct evaluation of MCC950 in IBM models remains limited; however, the compound’s demonstrated efficacy in analogous models and its effect on muscle function in rodents position it as a promising candidate for adaptation in IBM (Coll et al., 2015; Toldo & Abbate, 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, MCC950 exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by specifically binding to the NACHT domain of the NLRP3 protein. This binding appears to occur in close proximity to the ATP-binding Walker B motif, thereby blocking ATPase activity which is critical for the oligomerization and activation of NLRP3. By inhibiting the nucleotide‐dependent conformational changes required for inflammasome assembly, MCC950 prevents the downstream recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC as well as caspase-1 activation. This blockage stops the processing of pro-IL-1β into its active form, IL-1β, and similarly prevents maturation of IL-18. Detailed biochemical studies have confirmed that MCC950 does not interfere with other inflammasomes such as NLRP1, NLRC4, or AIM2, pointing to its robust selectivity for the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, mechanistic studies using photoaffinity labeling and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assays have demonstrated the direct engagement of MCC950 with the NLRP3 NACHT domain in both active and inactive conformational states. This mechanism is unique in that MCC950 essentially “locks” NLRP3 in a closed, inactive conformation, thereby inhibiting the cascade of inflammatory events (Coll et al., 2019; Vande Walle et al., 2019; El-Sayed et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the expected effect of MCC950 in an IBM setting would be the reduction of IL-1β maturation in affected myotubes, which in turn is anticipated to diminish downstream inflammasome-mediated processes such as caspase-1 activation and pyroptotic cell death. In vitro experiments using IBM myotubes should show that MCC950 reduces inflammatory cytokine release while preserving or restoring normal proteostasis. Consequently, with reduced caspase-1 activity, there would be a concomitant stabilization of the proteins that form the sarcomere, leading to improved contractile function and muscle strength. Evidence from preclinical rodent studies in inflammatory muscle models indicates that NLRP3 inhibition can lead to decreased pyroptosis and enhanced muscle force generation. Additionally, since NLRP3 is expressed in multiple cell types including muscle cells, inhibiting its activity in IBM-affected tissue is expected to result in a dramatic reduction in the chronic inflammatory milieu that characterizes the disease (Coll et al., 2015; Toldo & Abbate, 2024; Nizami et al., 2021). The hypothesis is that by dampening the inflammatory cascade, MCC950 could correct contractile deficits by preserving the structural and functional integrity of the myofibrils.

Overall Evaluation:
MCC950 presents as a compelling therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on its highly specific inhibitory action on the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key driver of IL-1β and IL-18 maturation. Its strong mechanistic rationale is bolstered by extensive biochemical studies demonstrating direct binding to the NACHT domain, thereby preventing inflammasome assembly and subsequent inflammatory signaling. This selectivity is a significant strength because it minimizes off-target effects and preserves other essential immune functions, an important consideration in a chronic disease setting like IBM (Coll et al., 2019; Vande Walle et al., 2019).

The therapeutic history of MCC950, with its demonstrated efficacy in multiple preclinical inflammatory models and acceptable safety profiles in early-phase clinical studies, further supports its potential for repurposing in IBM. While it has not yet been directly applied to IBM, analogous studies in muscle inflammation models and related conditions provide a strong foundation for its clinical exploration in this context. Moreover, the fact that MCC950 is orally bioavailable and synthetically tractable makes it an attractive candidate from a drug development and formulation standpoint (Coll et al., 2015; Kaur et al., 2025).

On the molecular level, the detailed understanding of MCC950’s mode of action—specifically targeting the ATPase activity of NLRP3 and preventing ASC oligomerization—defines its potential to abate the inflammation-driven proteostasis disruption observed in IBM. The hypothesis that inhibition of NLRP3-mediated caspase-1 activation could preserve sarcomeric integrity and improve contractility is well supported by preclinical evidence in other models of inflammatory myopathy and cardiac dysfunction (Coll et al., 2019; Toldo & Abbate, 2024).

However, a key weakness lies in the fact that MCC950 has not been directly validated in IBM-specific models; much of the current evidence is extrapolated from studies in neuroinflammatory, cardiovascular, and generalized muscle inflammation contexts. Additionally, there are some warnings from studies in genetic inflammatory disorders (such as CAPS) where certain NLRP3 mutations render MCC950 less effective or ineffective; although IBM predominantly involves wild-type NLRP3 activation, this factor must be considered when extrapolating preclinical results (Vande Walle et al., 2019; Coll et al., 2019).

In conclusion, the strengths of MCC950—the established selectivity for NLRP3, the robust mechanistic data indicating its ability to inhibit critical inflammatory pathways, its oral bioavailability, and supportive preclinical evidence in related inflammatory conditions—strongly support further investigation of its potential in Inclusion Body Myositis. The compound’s ability to block IL-1β maturation and reduce caspase-1–driven proteostatic disruption offers a promising therapeutic strategy to improve muscle contractility and slow disease progression in IBM. Nonetheless, further studies focusing on IBM-specific in vitro and in vivo models are essential to fully validate its efficacy and safety profile in this unique muscle pathology. Overall, MCC950 represents a novel and mechanistically precise approach to targeting inflammasome-driven inflammation and may provide a first-in-class therapeutic option for treating the unmet clinical need in IBM (Perera et al., 2018; Tanase et al., 2023; Krishnan et al., 2019).
