Proposal for SRT1720

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SRT1720 is a synthetic small‐molecule activator designed to target SIRT1, a NAD⁺‐dependent deacetylase that plays a central role in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis, cellular metabolism, and proteostasis. Originally identified through a high‐throughput screening approach, SRT1720 emerged as a potent compound belonging to the class of sirtuin‐activating compounds (Villalba & Alcaín, 2012). As a chemically synthesized molecule unrelated in structure to natural polyphenols such as resveratrol, SRT1720 was developed to overcome the limitations of naturally derived SIRT1 activators, including low bioavailability and nonspecific off‐target effects. Its chemical design allows it to allosterically enhance the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 by binding to specific sites on the enzyme that favor a conformational state associated with high catalytic efficiency (Park et al., 2017). Over the past decade, compounds in this class have been explored in preclinical studies across diverse disease models, notably in metabolic syndromes and age‐related neurodegeneration, where enhancement of mitochondrial function and stimulation of autophagic pathways have been key endpoints. SRT1720 is thus positioned not only as a metabolic modulator but also as an agent with potential for addressing cellular proteostasis defects—a critical aspect in diseases such as Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) (Sorrentino et al., 2018).

Therapeutic History:
SRT1720 has been subjected to extensive preclinical evaluation primarily in models of metabolic dysfunction, obesity, and insulin resistance. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that SRT1720 improves insulin sensitivity, reduces blood glucose levels, promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, and enhances ATP production in tissues such as liver, brown adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle (Villalba & Alcaín, 2012; Funk, 2012). For example, rodent experiments revealed that treatment with SRT1720 restored mitochondrial respiration and increased mitochondrial DNA copy number—a surrogate marker for mitochondrial biogenesis—in renal proximal tubule cells following oxidative injury (Funk, 2012). Moreover, studies in muscle tissue have shown that SIRT1 activation is associated with improved oxidative metabolism and muscle performance, although direct investigations using SRT1720 in models of neuromuscular diseases, such as IBM, are limited (Giovarelli et al., 2025; Lee & Goldberg, 2013). While SRT1720 itself has not been comprehensively tested in IBM, related sirtuin activators like SRT2104 have demonstrated exercise mimetic effects and improvements in dystrophic muscle models, suggesting that modulating SIRT1 activity may yield beneficial outcomes in muscle diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and proteostasis defects (Giovarelli et al., 2025; DeBartolo et al., 2024). Thus, although prior clinical or veterinary uses of SRT1720 specifically in IBM have not been reported, the preclinical success in metabolic and neuromuscular contexts provides a rationale for repurposing this compound for IBM.

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism by which SRT1720 is thought to exert its therapeutic effects is via the allosteric activation of SIRT1. SIRT1 deacetylates a number of critical substrates, including the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, FOXO transcription factors, and p53, which collectively contribute to mitochondrial biogenesis, improved oxidative metabolism, and enhanced cellular stress resistance (Villalba & Alcaín, 2012; Vinciguerra et al., 2010). Biochemically, SRT1720 binds to SIRT1 in a substrate-dependent manner; early in vitro studies indicated that its activation is particularly evident when a bulky hydrophobic residue is adjacent to the acetylated lysine on the substrate, which facilitates an active closed conformation of SIRT1 (Park et al., 2017; Giovarelli et al., 2025). However, subsequent work has suggested that the metabolic improvements observed with SRT1720—such as enhanced glucose tolerance and mitochondrial function—may require mechanisms beyond direct SIRT1 activation. Specifically, SRT1720 appears to also stimulate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) through a SIRT1-independent pathway involving the inhibition of phosphodiesterases (especially PDE4), an increase in intracellular cAMP levels, and subsequent activation of Epac1 and Ca²⁺-dependent kinases (Park et al., 2017). This cascade results in enhanced mitochondrial gene expression via deacetylation of PGC-1α and stabilization of mitochondrial function. Consequently, the biochemical interaction of SRT1720 involves both direct SIRT1 activation—ensuring the deacetylation of key proteins that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis—and indirect AMPK activation, which collectively stimulate pathways pivotal to energy metabolism and proteostasis (Sorrentino et al., 2018; Park et al., 2017). In skeletal muscle, where SIRT1 is naturally upregulated by exercise to promote oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial adaptation (Pardo & Boriek, 2011), SRT1720’s mode of action is especially relevant. Its ability to deacetylate PGC-1α promotes the transcription of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis, while modulation of FOXO activity can directly impact autophagic processes, further contributing to the removal of damaged proteins and organelles (Lee & Goldberg, 2013; Pardo & Boriek, 2011).

Expected Effect:
Within the context of IBM myotubes, the hypothesis is that SRT1720 will activate SIRT1, which in turn will initiate a series of molecular events leading to improved mitochondrial biogenesis, upregulation of autophagy, and reduction of proteotoxic stress. In IBM, the accumulation of misfolded proteins and defective organelles is a key aspect of muscle pathology, often associated with impaired mitochondrial function and compromised proteostasis. By promoting the deacetylation of PGC-1α, SRT1720 is expected to enhance the transcription of mitochondrial genes, leading to an increased mitochondrial mass and improved respiratory capacity—both of which are critical for maintaining muscle energy homeostasis and force generation (Funk, 2012; Sorrentino et al., 2018). Furthermore, SIRT1 activation is known to stimulate autophagy by deacetylating core autophagy components as well as regulatory transcription factors such as FOXO, thereby facilitating the clearance of protein aggregates and damaged organelles (Park et al., 2017; Pardo & Boriek, 2011). This dual effect on mitochondrial quality control and autophagic flux is expected to lessen proteotoxic stress, preserve sarcomere integrity, and ultimately improve muscle contractility. In addition, the SIRT1-mediated reduction in inflammation—through inhibition of NF-κB signaling by deacetylating the p65 subunit—further supports a protective role against the chronic inflammatory milieu observed in IBM (Wan, 2021). Given that SIRT1 expression is critical for muscle regeneration and maintenance, as evidenced by enhanced satellite cell function and resistance to oxidative stress in muscle tissue (Myers et al., 2019; Pardo & Boriek, 2011), the expected effect of SRT1720 in IBM would be an overall improvement in muscle fiber quality and force generation. The combined activation of mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy pathways should, therefore, mitigate the pathological protein accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction that are hallmarks of IBM.

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating the potential of SRT1720 as a therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis, several strengths and weaknesses emerge based on the literature review.
One of the primary strengths of SRT1720 is its established preclinical profile as a potent activator of SIRT1. The molecular mechanisms by which SRT1720 exerts its effects—specifically, the allosteric activation of SIRT1 leading to deacetylation of key substrates such as PGC-1α and FOXO transcription factors—directly address pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in IBM, including mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy, and proteostasis deficits (Villalba & Alcaín, 2012; Park et al., 2017). The dual mechanism, which includes both direct SIRT1 activation and independent AMPK activation through inhibition of PDE4, provides a multilayered approach to enhancing muscle energy metabolism and autophagic clearance, processes that are critically impaired in IBM (Park et al., 2017; Sorrentino et al., 2018). Additionally, evidence from related SIRT1 activators such as SRT2104—where exercise mimetic effects and improvements in dystrophic muscle have been reported—supports the notion that SIRT1 modulation can yield beneficial outcomes in the context of muscle degenerative diseases (Giovarelli et al., 2025; DeBartolo et al., 2024).

Furthermore, SRT1720 shows favourable pharmacological properties in rodent models in terms of oral bioavailability and the ability to target muscle tissue, making it an attractive candidate for repurposing in IBM treatment (Sorrentino et al., 2018; Funk, 2012). The scientific rationale behind using a SIRT1 activator in IBM is compelling given that aging and muscle wasting are both associated with reduced SIRT1 activity, and that restoration of SIRT1 function has been linked to enhanced mitochondrial health and improved muscle regeneration (Pardo & Boriek, 2011; Vinciguerra et al., 2010).

On the other hand, several weaknesses and challenges also warrant attention. First, controversies exist regarding the specificity of SRT1720 as a direct SIRT1 activator. Some studies have raised concerns that its activation of SIRT1 is substrate-dependent and may only be appreciable in assays using modified substrates, potentially limiting its efficacy against native targets in vivo (Park et al., 2017; Unknown Reference). Second, SRT1720’s metabolic effects in preclinical models are, in part, mediated by SIRT1-independent activation of AMPK, thereby complicating the interpretation of its mechanism of action and raising questions regarding its true target specificity (Park et al., 2017).

Moreover, while SRT1720’s efficacy has been well documented in metabolic and acute injury models (for instance, in renal and cardiac contexts), there is a paucity of direct preclinical or clinical data supporting its use in neuromuscular diseases such as IBM (Giovarelli et al., 2025; Unknown Reference). IBM is a distinct and complex myopathy with a multifactorial etiology involving not only mitochondrial dysfunction but also inflammatory and degenerative components that may not be fully addressed by SIRT1 activation alone. Therefore, extrapolation from other disease models, while encouraging, necessitates further targeted investigations in IBM-specific cellular and animal models.

Additionally, concerns regarding long-term safety and the potential for off-target effects remain. Although rodent pharmacokinetic studies suggest that SRT1720 is orally bioavailable and capable of crossing cellular membranes to reach intracellular SIRT1 targets (Funk, 2012), the translation of these findings to the human clinical scenario is not straightforward. The therapeutic window, dosing regimen, and sustained efficacy of SRT1720 in muscle tissue—particularly in the context of a chronic disease like IBM that may require long-term treatment—are as yet undefined.

In summary, SRT1720 is a promising therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on its ability to activate SIRT1 and, consequently, stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis, enhance autophagy, and improve proteostasis—all processes that are disrupted in IBM. Its synthetic origin and well-characterized preclinical performance in metabolic and stress-injury models underline its potential benefits. However, challenges including controversies about its direct mechanism of action, the dual activation of AMPK in a SIRT1‐independent manner, and the current lack of direct preclinical data in IBM necessitate rigorous further investigations. Future research should focus on establishing robust in vitro and in vivo models of IBM to evaluate SRT1720’s specific effects on muscle mitochondrial function, autophagic flux, and sarcomere integrity, as well as comprehensive pharmacokinetic and safety studies to support clinical translation. Overall, while strong in concept, SRT1720’s application to IBM requires careful experimental validation and optimization before it can be confidently advanced as a therapeutic option for this challenging neuromuscular disease (Sorrentino et al., 2018; Pardo & Boriek, 2011; Wan, 2021).
