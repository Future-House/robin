"(Immune co-culture apoptosis assay, 6)","(TDP-43 localization reporter assay, 2)","Candidate 1 uses a GFP-TDP-43 reporter in differentiating myotubes to quantify nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization under inflammatory stress. It offers a robust, high‐throughput readout of a key IBM biomarker, is relatively simple to implement in a 96‐well format, and can rapidly identify compounds that restore TDP-43 homeostasis. However, it relies on overexpression of a fusion protein, may produce nonphysiological artifacts, and does not directly measure a functional muscle‐cell endpoint or capture immune‐mediated pathology. Candidate 2 employs primary human myotubes co-cultured with patient‐derived CD8+ T cells under IFN-γ/TNF-α to model the antigen‐driven cytotoxic attack on muscle fibers. It directly measures cell death (cleaved caspase‐3/TUNEL), uses physiologically relevant primary cells, and closely mirrors a central IBM mechanism. Its limitations include assay complexity, potential variability in T-cell sources, and a need to incorporate necroptotic markers for full pathological coverage. Overall, Candidate 2 better reflects the in vivo immune–muscle interaction and provides a direct functional readout of muscle‐cell injury, albeit with moderate throughput and greater technical demands.","While the TDP-43 localization reporter is elegant and high throughput, it measures a surrogate molecular phenotype that may not translate directly into amelioration of muscle‐cell injury. The immune co-culture apoptosis assay, though more complex, directly models the pathogenic CD8+ T cell–mediated cytotoxicity central to IBM, uses primary human cells for enhanced relevance, and quantifies a bona fide functional endpoint (cell death). This makes it more biologically faithful and informative for screening therapeutics aimed at preventing immune‐driven muscle damage.",0,"(2, 6)","{'hypothesis': 'TDP-43 localization reporter assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay involves expressing a GFP-tagged TDP-43 fusion protein in differentiating myotubes to dynamically monitor TDP-43’s subcellular localization. Under basal conditions, TDP-43 is predominantly nuclear; however, in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), TDP-43 mislocalizes to the cytoplasm, forming aggregates. The assay quantifies the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence using automated imaging, particularly under inflammatory stress conditions. It is designed in a 96-well format to allow medium- to high-throughput screening of compounds that restore nuclear retention of TDP-43 in a controlled muscle-cell culture model (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 30-33, mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 232-235).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nTDP-43 aggregation and mislocalization have been robustly implicated in the pathogenesis of IBM. Numerous studies indicate that cytoplasmic accumulation of both full-length and truncated TDP-43 forms, often in a phosphorylated state, is a hallmark of IBM pathology (cykowski2018phosphorylatedtdp43(ptdp43) pages 8-9). Clinical evidence further establishes that, while TDP-43 mislocalization is not the sole driver of IBM pathology, it is a central event that correlates with muscle degeneration and impaired RNA metabolism (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 30-33). Biomedical literature supports the use of cellular reporter assays because they enable real-time, quantitative assessments of TDP-43 distribution and response to stressors that mimic the inflammatory microenvironment observed in IBM patient muscle tissue (besnard‐guerin2020cytoplasmiclocalizationof pages 1-2). Given the evidence linking TDP-43 mislocalization with mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired autophagy in IBM, targeting these pathways through modulation of TDP-43 localization represents a promising therapeutic strategy (zhang2017mitochondrialanalysisin pages 1-1).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nGFP-TDP-43 fusion reporters have been employed in cellular models to elucidate the mechanisms underlying TDP-43 dynamics and aggregation. In previous studies, similar assays in neuroblastoma and HeLa cell models demonstrated that aberrant fusion protein expression can lead to cytoplasmic mislocalization, providing mechanistic insights into TDP-43’s behavior under stress conditions (besnard‐guerin2020cytoplasmiclocalizationof pages 1-2). Moreover, reporter assays have been adapted to study stress granule dynamics and phosphorylation-dependent aggregation, which are relevant for neurodegenerative conditions and IBM alike (phan2023novelvcpactivator pages 19-22). Although direct reports in IBM myotubes are limited, analogous approaches in differentiating myotubes have underscored the assay’s capacity to quantify subtle changes induced by inflammatory mediators (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 235-238). This assay format has provided early-phase screening platforms for small molecules aimed at correcting TDP-43 localization, demonstrating its utility in drug discovery pipelines (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 261-264).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the assay include its direct visualization capability and quantifiable readout of TDP-43 localization dynamics, which are critical in IBM pathogenesis. The in vitro format using human myotubes permits experiments under controlled inflammatory stress, enabling investigation of how compounds impact TDP-43’s nuclear retention. Its compatibility with automated imaging in a 96-well plate lends itself to high-throughput screening, thereby accelerating early-stage drug discovery (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 232-235).  \nHowever, there are weaknesses to note. Overexpression of GFP-tagged TDP-43 may produce nonphysiological localization patterns or aggregation artifacts that do not fully recapitulate endogenous TDP-43 behavior (besnard‐guerin2020cytoplasmiclocalizationof pages 1-2). In addition, the simplified in vitro environment of differentiating myotubes may not capture the complex interplay of immune cells, autophagy dysfunction, and mitochondrial perturbations that occur in vivo in IBM (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 238-243). Finally, the assay may not faithfully reflect the formation of insoluble aggregates seen in patient muscle biopsies, thus necessitating complementary biochemical fractionation methods to detect pathological species (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 235-238).  \n\nIn conclusion, despite its limitations, the GFP-TDP-43 localization reporter assay provides a valuable, fast, and direct approach for identifying compounds that modulate TDP-43 localization—a central pathological feature in IBM—and serves as an important tool in early-stage drug discovery when paired with complementary models (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 30-33).', 'index': '2'}","{'hypothesis': 'Immune co-culture apoptosis assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis proposal centers on an immune co-culture apoptosis assay designed to recapitulate a central aspect of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) pathogenesis—namely, the direct cytotoxic interaction between autologous CD8+ T cells and muscle fibers.

Moreover, protein aggregation is only one facet of IBM pathology—mitochondrial dysfunction and immune-mediated muscle injury also contribute significantly, and these may require complementary assays for a holistic evaluation of therapeutic efficacy.

"(Proteasome catalytic activity assay, 8)","(UPR reporter assay, 4)","Both assays target critical facets of proteostasis dysfunction in IBM, but differ in biological context, functional resolution, and operational simplicity. The UPR reporter assay (Candidate 4) provides sensitive, real‐time monitoring of ER stress through integrated XBP1‐luciferase or CHOP‐GFP constructs in live myoblasts, capturing activation of distinct UPR branches. This offers mechanistic insights into IRE1‐XBP1 splicing and PERK‐CHOP signaling, enabling high‐throughput screening of chemical chaperones and UPR modulators. Its live‐cell format preserves upstream signaling and compensatory responses, but requires stable cell lines, careful reporter calibration, and does not directly measure downstream proteotoxic outcomes such as aggregate clearance or proteolysis.

In contrast, the proteasome catalytic activity assay (Candidate 8) delivers a direct, quantitative, plate‐based readout of 26S proteasome function via fluorogenic peptide substrates in muscle cell or biopsy lysates. It provides three orthogonal enzymatic metrics (chymotrypsin‐, trypsin‐, caspase‐like activities), directly assessing the terminal degradation machinery responsible for clearing ubiquitinated proteins. This approach is highly amenable to standard lab settings, rapid throughput, and straightforward data interpretation. However, it abstracts the cellular context by using lysates and focuses solely on the UPS, omitting upstream stress signaling (UPR, autophagy) and inflammatory interplay.

Both assays are well established in related protein aggregation disorders, enjoy robust literature support, and can be integrated into early drug discovery pipelines. The UPR reporter delivers pathway‐specific mechanistic resolution but requires subsequent assays for functional proteostasis. The proteasome assay offers a direct functional endpoint of proteostasis, is simpler to implement, and yields immediate insights into clearance capacity, albeit at the expense of upstream pathway detail.","While both assays offer valuable insights into IBM‐relevant proteostasis defects, the proteasome catalytic activity assay (Candidate 8) is superior as a primary in vitro screen. Its direct measurement of proteolytic capacity represents a concrete functional endpoint, aligning with the core pathological hallmark of aggregate accumulation in IBM. The assay’s simplicity—plate‐based lysate analysis with fluorogenic substrates—facilitates rapid, high‐throughput implementation in standard labs without the need for creating stable reporter lines. Although the UPR reporter assay provides mechanistic depth into ER stress signaling, its reliance on engineered cell lines and indirect relation to aggregate clearance reduces its practicality as a primary functional screen. Therefore, Candidate 8 is the preferred choice for initial therapeutic screening.",3,"(4, 8)","{'hypothesis': 'UPR reporter assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay utilizes a UPR reporter system, specifically either an XBP1-luciferase or a CHOP-GFP reporter, stably integrated into cultured myoblasts. It is designed to monitor the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a critical node in the pathogenesis of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), by providing quantifiable luminescent (via XBP1-luciferase) or fluorescent (via CHOP-GFP) outputs. The assay models a central aspect of IBM pathogenesis related to proteostasis dysfunction and ER stress, conditions that are critical in identifying pathogenic stimuli and screening potential therapeutic compounds. In practice, the reporter signal will be measured upon exposure of myoblast cultures to various stressors or proteostatic challenges (for example, chemical insults that promote misfolded protein accumulation), with signal changes indicating modulation of the UPR. The assay can be adapted to high-throughput screening formats, enabling rapid and quantitative analysis of chemical chaperones or UPR modulators that could ameliorate ER stress in IBM-relevant cell types (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 4-6, naitsaidi2023thesmallcompound pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThere is substantial biomedical evidence that ER stress and UPR activation are central to IBM pathogenesis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that markers of ER stress, such as spliced XBP1 (sXBP1) and CHOP, are elevated in IBM as well as other related myopathies, suggesting that proteostasis imbalance is a driving force in disease progression (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 15-18, ruparelia2024atrogin1promotesmuscle pages 18-19). Clinical analyses of muscle biopsies from IBM patients reveal elevated ER chaperones and stress markers, linking UPR activation to the formation of protein aggregates and vacuolar pathology characteristic of the disease (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 26-30, rusmini2016theroleof pages 13-17). This association is reinforced by genetic and immunohistochemical analyses showing that multiple branches of the UPR, including the IRE1-XBP1 pathway and the PERK-CHOP branch, contribute to the cellular response under stress conditions and regulate apoptotic as well as compensatory mechanisms in muscle, making the monitoring of these pathways highly relevant (krishna2023indicatorsofincreased pages 10-11).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nUPR reporter assays have been previously employed in various models of ER stress-linked pathologies. For instance, XBP1-luciferase constructs have been used to detect IRE1-mediated splicing events in different cell types and have served as quantitative indicators of the cellular response to proteotoxic stress (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 4-6). Similarly, CHOP-GFP assays have been utilized to monitor the pro-apoptotic signaling downstream of PERK activation and have provided insights into how modulation of this branch can impact cell viability and stress-induced apoptotic pathways (harish2019pharmacologicalmodulationof pages 32-35). Although direct application to IBM is underexplored in the literature, the widespread use of these reporters in drug discovery for other protein aggregation diseases underscores their potential utility in IBM research. They have enabled the identification of small molecules that modulate the UPR and restore proteostasis in models of related muscular dystrophies, suggesting that similar approaches could yield promising therapeutic candidates for IBM (naitsaidi2023thesmallcompound pages 1-2).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its high sensitivity and quantifiable output, which enables precise measurement of UPR activation in response to proteostatic challenges. The use of myoblasts as a model system is directly relevant because these cells capture key aspects of muscle pathology. Furthermore, the dual reporting capability (via luminescence or fluorescence) facilitates flexibility in high-throughput screening formats, essential for early-stage drug discovery. The assay allows for real-time monitoring of distinct UPR branches, thereby providing mechanistic insights into which specific pathways can be modulated to alleviate ER stress-related pathology.  \nHowever, weaknesses include the fact that in vitro cell culture systems may not fully recapitulate the complex tissue context of IBM, where additional factors such as inflammatory signaling and in vivo tissue architecture also play roles. Moreover, while reporter assays reliably quantify UPR activation, they do not directly measure downstream pathological events, such as protein aggregation or cell death, which are critical in IBM. Thus, while this assay is a valuable tool for primary screening and mechanistic studies, positive hits would require further validation in more complex models including animal studies and eventually clinical settings (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 8-11, preusse2022endoplasmicreticulum‐stressand pages 9-11).', 'index': '4'}","{'hypothesis': 'Proteasome catalytic activity assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay is a plate‐based measurement of proteasome catalytic activity in muscle cell lysates.

On the other hand, a significant weakness is that the UPS is only one facet of the multifactorial pathogenesis of IBM. The disease also involves autophagy dysfunction, inflammatory responses, and other cellular stress pathways; therefore, relying solely on proteasome activity may not fully capture the therapeutic benefits of a candidate compound (ju2010inclusionbodymyopathy pages 5-6).

The TDP-43 localization reporter assay uses GFP-tagged TDP-43 in human myotubes under inflammatory stress to dynamically quantify nuclear versus cytoplasmic distribution. This directly measures a hallmark of IBM pathology—TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation—in an intact cellular context, enabling real-time, medium-throughput compound screening. It is, however, prone to overexpression artifacts and does not capture all downstream functional consequences such as aggregate insolubility without supplementary biochemical fractionation. The proteasome catalytic activity assay quantifies chymotrypsin-, trypsin-, and caspase-like proteolysis in cell lysates via fluorogenic substrates, providing a rapid, plate-based, high-throughput readout of ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) function. While workflow simplicity and speed are strengths, it measures a broad proteostatic mechanism that is not unique to IBM and lacks cellular context regarding TDP-43 dynamics, inflammatory interplay, and aggregate morphology.","Given the central role of TDP-43 mislocalization in IBM pathogenesis and the assay’s ability to monitor this signature event in live myotubes under disease-relevant stress, the TDP-43 localization reporter assay offers greater biological specificity and direct functional relevance.

Under basal conditions, TDP-43 is predominantly nuclear; however, in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), TDP-43 mislocalizes to the cytoplasm, forming aggregates. The assay quantifies the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence using automated imaging, particularly under inflammatory stress conditions. It is designed in a 96-well format to allow medium- to high-throughput screening of compounds that restore nuclear retention of TDP-43 in a controlled muscle-cell culture model (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 30-33, mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 232-235).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nTDP-43 aggregation and mislocalization have been robustly implicated in the pathogenesis of IBM. Numerous studies indicate that cytoplasmic accumulation of both full-length and truncated TDP-43 forms, often in a phosphorylated state, is a hallmark of IBM pathology (cykowski2018phosphorylatedtdp43(ptdp43) pages 8-9). Clinical evidence further establishes that, while TDP-43 mislocalization is not the sole driver of IBM pathology, it is a central event that correlates with muscle degeneration and impaired RNA metabolism (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 30-33). Biomedical literature supports the use of cellular reporter assays because they enable real-time, quantitative assessments of TDP-43 distribution and response to stressors that mimic the inflammatory microenvironment observed in IBM patient muscle tissue (besnard‐guerin2020cytoplasmiclocalizationof pages 1-2). Given the evidence linking TDP-43 mislocalization with mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired autophagy in IBM, targeting these pathways through modulation of TDP-43 localization represents a promising therapeutic strategy (zhang2017mitochondrialanalysisin pages 1-1).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nGFP-TDP-43 fusion reporters have been employed in cellular models to elucidate the mechanisms underlying TDP-43 dynamics and aggregation.

Its compatibility with automated imaging in a 96-well plate lends itself to high-throughput screening, thereby accelerating early-stage drug discovery (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 232-235).  \nHowever, there are weaknesses to note. Overexpression of GFP-tagged TDP-43 may produce nonphysiological localization patterns or aggregation artifacts that do not fully recapitulate endogenous TDP-43 behavior (besnard‐guerin2020cytoplasmiclocalizationof pages 1-2).

The addition of these cytokines mimics the IBM muscle microenvironment by upregulating MHC class I expression on myotubes, thereby increasing their susceptibility to immune-mediated attack. This set-up is intended to trigger cell death, which is quantified via high-content imaging through markers such as cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL positivity. The use of primary human cells allows the assay to capture the patient-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses reflective of the antigen-driven, oligoclonal expansion seen in IBM muscle tissue (benveniste2015amyloiddepositsand pages 4-6, benveniste2019inclusionbodymyositis pages 2-3).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe inflammatory and degenerative interplay in IBM is characterized by the infiltration of highly differentiated CD8+ T cells, which express cytotoxic molecules such as perforin, granzymes, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (britson2020thereandback pages 12-17, damian2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 3-5).

Therefore, the myotube contractility assay (ID: 5) is chosen over the mitochondrial membrane potential assay (ID: 3).",6,"(3, 5)","{'hypothesis': 'Mitochondrial membrane potential assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThe proposed assay utilizes mitochondrial membrane potential measurement through fluorescent dyes such as TMRE or JC-1 in human skeletal muscle cell cultures. In this assay, cells are exposed to proinflammatory cytokines to mimic the inflammatory environment observed in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). This treatment is intended to induce mitochondrial dysfunction that parallels the clinical condition, notably a decrease in Δψm, impaired ATP production, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The assay quantitatively measures Δψm using live-cell imaging approaches, where the accumulation of TMRE or the ratiometric shift seen with JC-1 staining provides a sensitive readout of mitochondrial depolarization or hyperpolarization. Utilizing human skeletal muscle cells ensures that the cellular model closely reflects the tissue affected in IBM and incorporates the motivational effect of applying inflammatory stress on mitochondrial function (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 1-6, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 58-58, vianello2023highthroughputmicroscopyanalysis pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nMitochondrial dysfunction is a central feature in the pathogenesis of IBM. Clinical and biochemical evidence confirm that patients with IBM manifest signs of impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, defective ATP synthesis, and increased oxidative stress, which in part result from a depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential (catalangarcia2016mitochondrialdnadisturbances pages 1-2, garcia2017mitochondrialprofileand pages 33-43). Furthermore, the inflammatory milieu characteristic of IBM, driven by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, exacerbates mitochondrial damage. This is mechanistically relevant because inflammatory mediators not only impair mitochondrial dynamics but also directly induce mitochondrial membrane potential loss, leading to reduced energy production and increased apoptotic susceptibility (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 25-29, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 64-64). The use of TMRE or JC-1 staining in this context offers a direct method to assess these mitochondrial changes in real-time, linking the biochemical defect to the clinical pathology of muscle degeneration observed in IBM (Open Targets Search: Inclusion Body Myositis).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nMitochondrial membrane potential assays employing TMRE and JC-1 have been extensively used in the context of various muscle pathologies and models of inflammation. In studies of IBM and other inflammatory myopathies, such assays have provided significant insights into mitochondrial bioenergetics and the effect of putative drugs on restoring mitochondrial function (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 56-57, oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 1-6). For example, experiments with drug candidates such as mitochondrial homing agents have shown improvements in ATP levels and reduction in ROS production in patient-derived myoblasts and fibroblasts, even if their effects were validated through a combination of morphological and bioenergetic analyses rather than solely Δψm measurements (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 1-6, lightfoot2015ss31attenuatestnfα pages 6-11). Additionally, high-throughput microscopy methods have been applied to these assays, underscoring their adaptability for drug screening applications in muscle diseases (vianello2023highthroughputmicroscopyanalysis pages 1-2).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths:  \n• The assay directly measures a critical parameter (Δψm) that serves as an early biomarker for mitochondrial dysfunction, central to IBM pathogenesis.  \n• It uses live-cell imaging, which enables high-throughput and real-time analysis of mitochondrial health under inflammatory conditions.  \n• The incorporation of human skeletal muscle cells closely mimics the cell type affected in IBM, thereby enhancing the translational relevance of the findings (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 1-6, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 58-58).\n\nWeaknesses:  \n• Although robust, Δψm assays can sometimes be confounded by dye loading variability and photobleaching, which may affect reproducibility.  \n• The inflammatory cytokine model, while informative, may not fully recapitulate the chronic and multifactorial nature of IBM pathology, necessitating complementary assays for a comprehensive evaluation of mitochondrial function and muscle degeneration (garcia2017mitochondrialprofileand pages 33-43).\n\nIn summary, the mitochondrial membrane potential assay using TMRE or JC-1 in cytokine-treated human skeletal muscle cells represents a highly relevant and scientifically grounded tool for early-stage drug screening in Inclusion Body Myositis.

This approach has high biological relevance, captures patient‐specific immune responses, and directly measures therapeutic effects on the core immune–muscle axis. Its main drawbacks are complexity in sourcing autologous T cells, the in vitro replication of T‐cell activation states, and possible underrepresentation of necroptotic vs apoptotic cell death.

In this assay, primary human myotubes are co-cultured with patient-derived, antigen-exposed CD8+ T cells in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α. The addition of these cytokines mimics the IBM muscle microenvironment by upregulating MHC class I expression on myotubes, thereby increasing their susceptibility to immune-mediated attack. This set-up is intended to trigger cell death, which is quantified via high-content imaging through markers such as cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL positivity. The use of primary human cells allows the assay to capture the patient-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses reflective of the antigen-driven, oligoclonal expansion seen in IBM muscle tissue (benveniste2015amyloiddepositsand pages 4-6, benveniste2019inclusionbodymyositis pages 2-3).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe inflammatory and degenerative interplay in IBM is characterized by the infiltration of highly differentiated CD8+ T cells, which express cytotoxic molecules such as perforin, granzymes, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (britson2020thereandback pages 12-17, damian2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 3-5). This cellular component is central to IBM pathogenesis, as these T cells engage in direct cytotoxic interactions with muscle fibers that overexpress MHC class I under the influence of IFN-γ and TNF-α (bhattarai2017functionalroleof pages 19-24, guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 13-15). The assay’s focus on apoptosis detection (cleaved caspase-3 or TUNEL) aligns with observed immune-mediated muscle fiber injury, despite some debate whether the predominant mode of cell death is apoptotic or necroptotic (kamiya2023musclefibernecroptosis pages 2-3, mccord2023cytotoxicimmunecells pages 1-2). Importantly, clinical and pathological analyses highlight that the antigen recognition by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells drives muscle damage and may be a key trigger for downstream degenerative processes (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 27-28, nelke2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 1-2). This assay therefore models a pathogenic mechanism that is both immunologically and clinically relevant.\n\nPrevious Use:  \nCo-culture systems involving myotubes and cytotoxic T cells have been used in earlier studies to investigate the direct effects of immune cell infiltration on muscle cells. For instance, in vitro models employing similar co-culture settings have demonstrated that CD8+ T cells can induce muscle cell apoptosis, as evidenced by cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL positivity (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 153-157). Such assays have played a role in elucidating the involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic T cell-induced muscle damage in IBM. While direct correlation between in vitro findings and in vivo IBM pathology remains complex, these models have contributed to our understanding of the immunologic mechanisms underlying muscle fiber injury, informing the development of immunomodulators targeting the T cell–muscle cell axis (hou2021interferongammamediatesskeletal pages 11-14, danielsson2016theclinicaland pages 42-45).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths:  \n• The assay directly targets a well-characterized pathogenic mechanism in IBM—the CD8+ T cell–mediated cytotoxic attack on muscle fibers—thereby offering clear mechanistic insight into potential therapeutic interventions (benveniste2015amyloiddepositsand pages 4-6, britson2020thereandback pages 12-17).  \n• It employs primary human cells, which increases its physiological relevance and potential for personalized drug screening (nelke2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 1-2).  \n• The use of high-content imaging allows robust quantitative measurement of cell death, facilitating evaluation of therapeutic compounds aimed at mitigating immune-mediated cytotoxicity (mccord2023cytotoxicimmunecells pages 11-12).\n\nWeaknesses:  \n• There is ongoing debate regarding the exact mode of muscle fiber death in IBM, with some evidence suggesting that necroptosis rather than classical apoptosis may be predominant (kamiya2023musclefibernecroptosis pages 3-4).

The assay quantitatively determines the rate at which autophagosomes are generated and degraded over time when challenged with proteostatic stress (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nImpaired autophagy plays a central role in the pathogenesis of IBM. Multiple independent studies have highlighted defects in autophagosome formation and accumulation of autophagy-related markers such as LC3B-II and p62 in both muscle tissue and patient-derived fibroblasts. Reduced autophagic activity leads to insufficient clearance of damaged proteins and organelles, propagating cellular stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately muscle degeneration (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2).

Therefore, assessing autophagic flux using GFP‐LC3 reporter assays directly relates to a core pathogenic mechanism in IBM. By quantitatively measuring dynamic changes in autophagic flux, researchers can determine if candidate drugs enhance the autophagy pathway and promote the removal of toxic aggregates, which is essential for halting or reversing muscle degeneration in IBM (margeta2020autophagydefectsin pages 17-19, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 66-67).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nThe GFP‐LC3 puncta assay, in combination with bafilomycin A1, has been widely used in autophagy research, including in the evaluation of muscle diseases and related myopathies.

It also does not capture contractile deficits or full IBM pathogenesis such as immune cell interplay and autophagy impairment.
Candidate 2 (Myotube contractility assay, ID:5) measures the functional contractile performance of patient-derived iPSC myotubes via electrical field stimulation and video‐based quantification, directly addressing the key clinical manifestation of IBM—progressive muscle weakness. This assay leverages patient genetic background for high translational relevance and can be scaled to medium throughput. Its main drawbacks are the need for specialized substrates and stimulation hardware, differentiation variability among iPSC lines, and the absence of immune-microenvironmental factors. Despite these limitations, it delivers a direct functional endpoint aligned with muscle performance deficits observed in IBM patients.","While the TDP-43 localization assay offers mechanistic insights and rapid imaging-based screening, it does not measure muscle function directly and may produce artifacts from protein overexpression. The myotube contractility assay, by contrast, assesses a functional endpoint—contractile strength—that correlates closely with patient‐relevant phenotypes and clinical outcomes. Its use of patient-derived iPSCs enhances biological relevance, and its medium-throughput implementation balances complexity and throughput. For early‐stage drug discovery aiming to restore muscle performance in IBM, the contractility assay provides more directly actionable data.",9,"(2, 5)","{'hypothesis': 'TDP-43 localization reporter assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay involves expressing a GFP-tagged TDP-43 fusion protein in differentiating myotubes to dynamically monitor TDP-43’s subcellular localization. Under basal conditions, TDP-43 is predominantly nuclear; however, in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), TDP-43 mislocalizes to the cytoplasm, forming aggregates. The assay quantifies the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence using automated imaging, particularly under inflammatory stress conditions. It is designed in a 96-well format to allow medium- to high-throughput screening of compounds that restore nuclear retention of TDP-43 in a controlled muscle-cell culture model (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 30-33, mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 232-235).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nTDP-43 aggregation and mislocalization have been robustly implicated in the pathogenesis of IBM. Numerous studies indicate that cytoplasmic accumulation of both full-length and truncated TDP-43 forms, often in a phosphorylated state, is a hallmark of IBM pathology (cykowski2018phosphorylatedtdp43(ptdp43) pages 8-9). Clinical evidence further establishes that, while TDP-43 mislocalization is not the sole driver of IBM pathology, it is a central event that correlates with muscle degeneration and impaired RNA metabolism (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 30-33). Biomedical literature supports the use of cellular reporter assays because they enable real-time, quantitative assessments of TDP-43 distribution and response to stressors that mimic the inflammatory microenvironment observed in IBM patient muscle tissue (besnard‐guerin2020cytoplasmiclocalizationof pages 1-2). Given the evidence linking TDP-43 mislocalization with mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired autophagy in IBM, targeting these pathways through modulation of TDP-43 localization represents a promising therapeutic strategy (zhang2017mitochondrialanalysisin pages 1-1).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nGFP-TDP-43 fusion reporters have been employed in cellular models to elucidate the mechanisms underlying TDP-43 dynamics and aggregation. In previous studies, similar assays in neuroblastoma and HeLa cell models demonstrated that aberrant fusion protein expression can lead to cytoplasmic mislocalization, providing mechanistic insights into TDP-43’s behavior under stress conditions (besnard‐guerin2020cytoplasmiclocalizationof pages 1-2). Moreover, reporter assays have been adapted to study stress granule dynamics and phosphorylation-dependent aggregation, which are relevant for neurodegenerative conditions and IBM alike (phan2023novelvcpactivator pages 19-22). Although direct reports in IBM myotubes are limited, analogous approaches in differentiating myotubes have underscored the assay’s capacity to quantify subtle changes induced by inflammatory mediators (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 235-238). This assay format has provided early-phase screening platforms for small molecules aimed at correcting TDP-43 localization, demonstrating its utility in drug discovery pipelines (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 261-264).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the assay include its direct visualization capability and quantifiable readout of TDP-43 localization dynamics, which are critical in IBM pathogenesis. The in vitro format using human myotubes permits experiments under controlled inflammatory stress, enabling investigation of how compounds impact TDP-43’s nuclear retention. Its compatibility with automated imaging in a 96-well plate lends itself to high-throughput screening, thereby accelerating early-stage drug discovery (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 232-235).  \nHowever, there are weaknesses to note. Overexpression of GFP-tagged TDP-43 may produce nonphysiological localization patterns or aggregation artifacts that do not fully recapitulate endogenous TDP-43 behavior (besnard‐guerin2020cytoplasmiclocalizationof pages 1-2). In addition, the simplified in vitro environment of differentiating myotubes may not capture the complex interplay of immune cells, autophagy dysfunction, and mitochondrial perturbations that occur in vivo in IBM (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 238-243). Finally, the assay may not faithfully reflect the formation of insoluble aggregates seen in patient muscle biopsies, thus necessitating complementary biochemical fractionation methods to detect pathological species (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 235-238).  \n\nIn conclusion, despite its limitations, the GFP-TDP-43 localization reporter assay provides a valuable, fast, and direct approach for identifying compounds that modulate TDP-43 localization—a central pathological feature in IBM—and serves as an important tool in early-stage drug discovery when paired with complementary models (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 30-33).', 'index': '2'}","{'hypothesis': 'Myotube contractility assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis myotube contractility assay is designed to measure the functional contractile properties of iPSC‐derived myotubes cultured on flexible substrates. The assay applies electrical field stimulation to mimic in vivo muscle contraction and uses video‐based analysis software to quantitatively assess contraction amplitude and frequency. The measured endpoints provide a functional readout of muscle cell performance, which is critical given that Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and impaired contractility. The biological material used is patient‐derived iPSCs that are differentiated into myotubes; these cells retain patient-specific genetic and molecular signatures representative of IBM pathology, offering high biomedical relevance (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 1-2, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central pathogenesis of IBM involves not only structural changes like rimmed vacuoles and protein aggregation but also a clear functional consequence—diminished contractile force in muscle fibers, which translates clinically to progressive weakness and decline in daily function. Electrical stimulation of myotubes provides a physiologically relevant approach to mimic exercise-induced muscle contraction. Studies have shown that under electrical stimulus, even sIBM-derived myotubes reveal unusual responses such as abnormal cytoplasmic localization of TDP-43, a hallmark of disease that is not readily seen under static conditions (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 1-2, li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 11-12). Furthermore, contractility assays have been linked to functional outcomes that correlate with muscle strength in clinical settings, as seen in evaluations of interventions like high-dose IVIg, where improvements in muscle strength were required for therapeutic impact (NCT00001261). By continuing this line of inquiry, the assay is positioned to serve as a robust tool for screening drugs that can restore or improve contractile deficits in IBM (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 235-238, Clinical Trial Search: Inclusion Body Myositis AND (myotube OR muscle fiber OR in vitro OR contractility OR iPSC)).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nContractility assays employing electrically stimulated muscle cells have been widely used in the investigation of various muscle diseases, including but not limited to muscular dystrophies and myotonic disorders. Platforms such as the MyoTACTIC system have been successfully implemented to evaluate muscle force generation and calcium handling in engineered human muscle microtissues, underscoring the relevance of such functional assays in preclinical drug development (afshar2020a96wellculture pages 5-7). Although direct application of these assays to IBM is not as extensive, previous studies using feeder-supported satellite cell models have shown that exercise-mimicking stimulation protocols can reveal IBM-specific phenotypes, such as TDP-43 mislocalization upon contraction, demonstrating that contractile function is a measurable and disease-relevant endpoint (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 1-2). This supports the extrapolation of contractility assays for early-stage drug discovery in IBM, akin to how similar methodologies have informed mechanistic insights and pharmacological testing in other muscle diseases (broer2020canwemimic pages 2-4, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 69-73).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths:  \n• The assay directly measures a function—contractility—that is central to muscle performance and clinical manifestations of IBM. This offers a more relevant functional endpoint compared to indirect markers such as myotube diameter or myosin heavy chain expression (hamaguchi2022establishmentofa pages 1-2).  \n• Using patient-derived iPSC-derived myotubes ensures that the model captures patient-specific disease features, increasing the translational relevance for drug screening (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2).  \n• The non-invasive, video-based quantification method can be potentially scaled for medium-throughput screenings, expediting early-stage therapeutic discovery (afshar2020a96wellculture pages 5-7).\n\nWeaknesses:  \n• While the contractility assay is effective at quantifying muscle function, it may not fully replicate the multifactorial in vivo environment of IBM which includes significant contributions from immune-mediated inflammation and extracellular matrix interactions. In vitro systems generally lack immune and stromal components critical to IBM pathogenesis (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 235-238, broer2020canwemimic pages 2-4).  \n• Differentiation variability among iPSC lines may lead to heterogeneity in myotube maturation and contractile properties, posing challenges in assay standardization and reproducibility (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2).  \n• The focus on contractile function alone may overlook other important pathological features such as protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and autophagy impairment, which are also key in IBM (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 11-12, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 56-57).\n\nIn summary, the proposed electrically stimulated myotube contractility assay offers a robust, functionally relevant platform for early-stage IBM drug discovery by directly measuring muscle contraction deficits.

This ELISA/AlphaLISA-based approach offers high sensitivity and quantitative data on kinase activity (GSK-3β, CDK5) in cytokine-treated myoblasts, enabling medium-throughput small-molecule screening. However, tau pathology in IBM is uneven across patients, and reliance on exogenous cytokine stimuli can introduce variability. It also remains a surrogate marker for aggregate formation rather than a functional endpoint. Candidate 4 (UPR reporter assay) employs stably integrated XBP1-luciferase or CHOP-GFP in myoblasts to monitor ER stress and unfolded protein response in real time. UPR activation is well documented in IBM patient biopsies, implicating proteostasis failure as a driving force. The luminescent/fluorescent readout is rapid, adaptable to high-throughput formats, and mechanistically informative regarding specific UPR branches. While this assay does not directly measure aggregate formation or cell death, it captures a central pathogenic node (ER stress) in a simple, robust manner with minimal variability introduced by exogenous treatments.","The UPR reporter assay (Candidate 4) is preferred because it directly interrogates proteostasis dysfunction—a core mechanism in IBM—using a simple, stable, and high-throughput compatible readout.

The assay employs either AlphaLISA or ELISA methodologies that target specific phosphorylated tau epitopes (e.g., p-Ser202/Thr205) to provide a sensitive, plate-based readout of tau phosphorylation levels. The proposed model uses cytokine-treated muscle cells to simulate the inflammatory environment observed in IBM, thereby inducing aberrant tau phosphorylation mediated by kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). By applying small-molecule modulators to these cell cultures, one can directly assess therapeutic intervention effects on tau hyperphosphorylation. The biological material for this assay includes established muscle cell models—such as C2C12 myoblasts—or potentially even alternative models where human tau is expressed in muscle (as supported by studies using C. elegans muscle models) (Clinical Trials Search: phosphorylated tau AND inclusion body myositis, NCT00917956; russell2021generationandcharacterization pages 5-7).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nPathologically, IBM is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and intracellular protein inclusions containing phosphorylated tau, similar to tauopathies in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. The hyperphosphorylation of tau is central to inclusion formation by inducing its detachment from microtubules and subsequent aggregation, leading to cellular dysfunction. In addition, inflammatory cytokines prevalent in IBM not only contribute to muscle damage but also exacerbate kinase activation, particularly GSK-3β and CDK5, which in turn drive tau phosphorylation. Consequently, monitoring tau phosphorylation levels is highly relevant for both understanding disease mechanisms and evaluating therapeutic efficacy. Clinical evidence, including a pilot trial in IBM patients using lithium (a GSK-3β inhibitor), underscores the potential impact of regulating tau phosphorylation on disease pathology, thereby reinforcing the assay’s relevance (NCT00917956; piazzi2021revisitingtherole pages 8-10).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nPhospho-tau quantification assays, utilizing techniques such as ELISA and AlphaLISA, have been extensively applied in the context of neurodegenerative diseases to monitor disease progression and assess therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing tau hyperphosphorylation. Specifically, in Alzheimer’s disease research, these assays have identified alterations in tau phosphorylation in response to kinase modulators, thereby validating their utility in a high-throughput screening context. Moreover, initial clinical studies in IBM have demonstrated the feasibility of assessing phosphorylated tau levels in muscle biopsies before and after treatment, re-emphasizing that such assay platforms can be repurposed for IBM therapeutic screening (Clinical Trials Search: phosphorylated tau AND inclusion body myositis; zhang2020anovelapplication pages 1-3).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the phospho-tau quantification assay include its high sensitivity and quantitative nature, allowing for precise measurement of pathological tau forms that are directly linked to disease progression. The assay’s ability to screen small-molecule modulators of kinases like GSK-3β and CDK5 is particularly valuable, given the established involvement of these enzymes in IBM pathology. Additionally, an ELISA or AlphaLISA platform is amenable to high-throughput screening, which is critical in early-stage drug discovery and mechanistic studies (magalhaes2024naturalantitauautoantibodies pages 32-35).\n\nHowever, the assay also faces potential challenges. The heterogeneity of tau pathology in IBM tissue—where not all patients exhibit phosphorylated tau inclusions uniformly—could complicate data interpretation. Furthermore, while the inflammatory context simulated through cytokine treatment enhances relevance, it may also introduce variability due to the complex interplay between immune responses and kinase activity in muscle cells (piazzi2021revisitingtherole pages 1-3).

In this assay, cells are exposed to proinflammatory cytokines to mimic the inflammatory environment observed in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). This treatment is intended to induce mitochondrial dysfunction that parallels the clinical condition, notably a decrease in Δψm, impaired ATP production, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The assay quantitatively measures Δψm using live-cell imaging approaches, where the accumulation of TMRE or the ratiometric shift seen with JC-1 staining provides a sensitive readout of mitochondrial depolarization or hyperpolarization. Utilizing human skeletal muscle cells ensures that the cellular model closely reflects the tissue affected in IBM and incorporates the motivational effect of applying inflammatory stress on mitochondrial function (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 1-6, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 58-58, vianello2023highthroughputmicroscopyanalysis pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nMitochondrial dysfunction is a central feature in the pathogenesis of IBM. Clinical and biochemical evidence confirm that patients with IBM manifest signs of impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, defective ATP synthesis, and increased oxidative stress, which in part result from a depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential (catalangarcia2016mitochondrialdnadisturbances pages 1-2, garcia2017mitochondrialprofileand pages 33-43). Furthermore, the inflammatory milieu characteristic of IBM, driven by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, exacerbates mitochondrial damage. This is mechanistically relevant because inflammatory mediators not only impair mitochondrial dynamics but also directly induce mitochondrial membrane potential loss, leading to reduced energy production and increased apoptotic susceptibility (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 25-29, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 64-64). The use of TMRE or JC-1 staining in this context offers a direct method to assess these mitochondrial changes in real-time, linking the biochemical defect to the clinical pathology of muscle degeneration observed in IBM (Open Targets Search: Inclusion Body Myositis).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nMitochondrial membrane potential assays employing TMRE and JC-1 have been extensively used in the context of various muscle pathologies and models of inflammation. In studies of IBM and other inflammatory myopathies, such assays have provided significant insights into mitochondrial bioenergetics and the effect of putative drugs on restoring mitochondrial function (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 56-57, oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 1-6). For example, experiments with drug candidates such as mitochondrial homing agents have shown improvements in ATP levels and reduction in ROS production in patient-derived myoblasts and fibroblasts, even if their effects were validated through a combination of morphological and bioenergetic analyses rather than solely Δψm measurements (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 1-6, lightfoot2015ss31attenuatestnfα pages 6-11). Additionally, high-throughput microscopy methods have been applied to these assays, underscoring their adaptability for drug screening applications in muscle diseases (vianello2023highthroughputmicroscopyanalysis pages 1-2).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths:  \n• The assay directly measures a critical parameter (Δψm) that serves as an early biomarker for mitochondrial dysfunction, central to IBM pathogenesis.  \n• It uses live-cell imaging, which enables high-throughput and real-time analysis of mitochondrial health under inflammatory conditions.  \n• The incorporation of human skeletal muscle cells closely mimics the cell type affected in IBM, thereby enhancing the translational relevance of the findings (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 1-6, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 58-58).\n\nWeaknesses:  \n• Although robust, Δψm assays can sometimes be confounded by dye loading variability and photobleaching, which may affect reproducibility.  \n• The inflammatory cytokine model, while informative, may not fully recapitulate the chronic and multifactorial nature of IBM pathology, necessitating complementary assays for a comprehensive evaluation of mitochondrial function and muscle degeneration (garcia2017mitochondrialprofileand pages 33-43).\n\nIn summary, the mitochondrial membrane potential assay using TMRE or JC-1 in cytokine-treated human skeletal muscle cells represents a highly relevant and scientifically grounded tool for early-stage drug screening in Inclusion Body Myositis.

It focuses on quantifying the three primary proteolytic activities mediated by the 26S proteasome: chymotrypsin‐like, trypsin‐like, and caspase‐like (also referred to as PGPH in some literature). The methodology relies on fluorogenic peptides that emit a fluorescent signal upon cleavage by the active proteasome. The assay is conducted using lysates from cultured muscle cells or patient‐derived muscle fibers that exhibit the protein aggregate formation characteristic of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). The readouts offer quantitative data reflective of the ubiquitin–proteasome system’s (UPS) functionality, which is essential for degrading misfolded or damaged proteins (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8, nogalska2010inaβpp‐overexpressingcultured pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central pathology of IBM involves abnormal protein aggregation and impaired muscle proteostasis. These features are linked to dysfunction of the UPS, as evidenced by the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, misfolded protein aggregates, and decreased enzymatic activities within the proteasome. Biochemical studies show that in both sporadic and inclusion body variants of myositis, impaired proteasome function correlates with disease severity. This link is supported by literature documenting reduced proteolytic capacities in IBM muscle tissue, which contributes directly to cellular stress and muscle fiber degeneration (ahmed2016targetingproteinhomeostasis pages 1-3, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 13-14). Clinically, muscle biopsies from IBM patients reveal aggregation of proteins that are normally cleared by the proteasome, reinforcing the relevance of assessing proteasome activity as a measure of disease status and therapeutic response (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nProteasome catalytic activity assays have been applied extensively in the study of neuromuscular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders where UPS impairment is a hallmark. In vitro models simulating IBM have employed these fluorogenic peptide assays to demonstrate how proteasome inhibition leads to toxic protein accumulation. For instance, studies using cultured human muscle fibers overexpressing proteins such as amyloid‐β precursor protein (AβPP) have confirmed that diminished proteasome activity is closely linked to the pathogenesis seen in IBM (nogalska2010inaβpp‐overexpressingcultured pages 1-2). Moreover, similar assays have been used in drug screening applications in other models of protein aggregation disorders, where compounds that restore proteasome activity were identified as promising candidates for ameliorating aggregate accumulation. Although clinical trials with direct measurements of proteasome activity in IBM are sparse (Clinical Trials Search: proteasome activity AND Inclusion Body Myositis), the preclinical use of this assay in comparable disease models validates its utility for drug discovery (li2013unfoldedproteinresponse pages 1-2).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the proteasome catalytic activity assay include its direct measurement of a key enzymatic process central to IBM pathogenesis, rapid plate-based format, and quantitative output that supports high-throughput drug screening. By providing a functional readout of UPS integrity, it can serve as a surrogate marker for therapeutic efficacy in early-stage in vitro models, correlating improvements in proteasome activity with potential reductions in pathogenic protein aggregates (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8). On the other hand, a significant weakness is that the UPS is only one facet of the multifactorial pathogenesis of IBM. The disease also involves autophagy dysfunction, inflammatory responses, and other cellular stress pathways; therefore, relying solely on proteasome activity may not fully capture the therapeutic benefits of a candidate compound (ju2010inclusionbodymyopathy pages 5-6). Additionally, while in vitro models provide controlled conditions, translating these findings into in vivo efficacy remains a challenge due to the complex interplay of muscle degeneration and immune responses in patients (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 23-24). In summary, when used as part of a broader panel of assays, the proteasome catalytic activity assay is a scientifically robust and practically valuable tool for early-stage drug discovery in IBM (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8, nogalska2010inaβpp‐overexpressingcultured pages 1-2).', 'index': '8'}"

However, reliance on overexpression of GFP-TDP-43 may introduce nonphysiological artifacts, and the assay measures only subcellular distribution rather than functional outcomes such as aggregate clearance or cell viability.

Under basal conditions, TDP-43 is predominantly nuclear; however, in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), TDP-43 mislocalizes to the cytoplasm, forming aggregates. The assay quantifies the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence using automated imaging, particularly under inflammatory stress conditions. It is designed in a 96-well format to allow medium- to high-throughput screening of compounds that restore nuclear retention of TDP-43 in a controlled muscle-cell culture model (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 30-33, mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 232-235).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nTDP-43 aggregation and mislocalization have been robustly implicated in the pathogenesis of IBM. Numerous studies indicate that cytoplasmic accumulation of both full-length and truncated TDP-43 forms, often in a phosphorylated state, is a hallmark of IBM pathology (cykowski2018phosphorylatedtdp43(ptdp43) pages 8-9). Clinical evidence further establishes that, while TDP-43 mislocalization is not the sole driver of IBM pathology, it is a central event that correlates with muscle degeneration and impaired RNA metabolism (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 30-33). Biomedical literature supports the use of cellular reporter assays because they enable real-time, quantitative assessments of TDP-43 distribution and response to stressors that mimic the inflammatory microenvironment observed in IBM patient muscle tissue (besnard‐guerin2020cytoplasmiclocalizationof pages 1-2). Given the evidence linking TDP-43 mislocalization with mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired autophagy in IBM, targeting these pathways through modulation of TDP-43 localization represents a promising therapeutic strategy (zhang2017mitochondrialanalysisin pages 1-1).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nGFP-TDP-43 fusion reporters have been employed in cellular models to elucidate the mechanisms underlying TDP-43 dynamics and aggregation. In previous studies, similar assays in neuroblastoma and HeLa cell models demonstrated that aberrant fusion protein expression can lead to cytoplasmic mislocalization, providing mechanistic insights into TDP-43’s behavior under stress conditions (besnard‐guerin2020cytoplasmiclocalizationof pages 1-2). Moreover, reporter assays have been adapted to study stress granule dynamics and phosphorylation-dependent aggregation, which are relevant for neurodegenerative conditions and IBM alike (phan2023novelvcpactivator pages 19-22). Although direct reports in IBM myotubes are limited, analogous approaches in differentiating myotubes have underscored the assay’s capacity to quantify subtle changes induced by inflammatory mediators (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 235-238). This assay format has provided early-phase screening platforms for small molecules aimed at correcting TDP-43 localization, demonstrating its utility in drug discovery pipelines (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 261-264).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the assay include its direct visualization capability and quantifiable readout of TDP-43 localization dynamics, which are critical in IBM pathogenesis. The in vitro format using human myotubes permits experiments under controlled inflammatory stress, enabling investigation of how compounds impact TDP-43’s nuclear retention. Its compatibility with automated imaging in a 96-well plate lends itself to high-throughput screening, thereby accelerating early-stage drug discovery (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 232-235).  \nHowever, there are weaknesses to note. Overexpression of GFP-tagged TDP-43 may produce nonphysiological localization patterns or aggregation artifacts that do not fully recapitulate endogenous TDP-43 behavior (besnard‐guerin2020cytoplasmiclocalizationof pages 1-2). In addition, the simplified in vitro environment of differentiating myotubes may not capture the complex interplay of immune cells, autophagy dysfunction, and mitochondrial perturbations that occur in vivo in IBM (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 238-243).

This assay directly measures the dynamics of autophagy by assessing autophagosome formation and clearance. The use of a fluorescent LC3 reporter enables visualization of autophagosome accumulation, where an increase in puncta upon bafilomycin A1 treatment indicates active flux. In the context of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), this assay would typically be applied to muscle-related cells such as myotubes—especially those derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to better recapitulate muscle-specific pathology—or patient-derived fibroblasts which have also demonstrated autophagic dysfunction. The assay quantitatively determines the rate at which autophagosomes are generated and degraded over time when challenged with proteostatic stress (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nImpaired autophagy plays a central role in the pathogenesis of IBM. Multiple independent studies have highlighted defects in autophagosome formation and accumulation of autophagy-related markers such as LC3B-II and p62 in both muscle tissue and patient-derived fibroblasts. Reduced autophagic activity leads to insufficient clearance of damaged proteins and organelles, propagating cellular stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately muscle degeneration (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2). The clinical landscape underscores that targeting autophagy modulation may have therapeutic benefits, as conventional immunosuppressive treatments have shown limited efficacy, and there is significant interest in drugs that restore proteostasis (Clinical Trial Search: autophagy OR lysosomal enhancement OR proteostasis OR autophagic flux AND myositis OR muscle myopathy). Therefore, assessing autophagic flux using GFP‐LC3 reporter assays directly relates to a core pathogenic mechanism in IBM. By quantitatively measuring dynamic changes in autophagic flux, researchers can determine if candidate drugs enhance the autophagy pathway and promote the removal of toxic aggregates, which is essential for halting or reversing muscle degeneration in IBM (margeta2020autophagydefectsin pages 17-19, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 66-67).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nThe GFP‐LC3 puncta assay, in combination with bafilomycin A1, has been widely used in autophagy research, including in the evaluation of muscle diseases and related myopathies. Prior studies in models of skeletal myopathy—including plectin-deficient muscle cells—have employed similar approaches to delineate autophagic flux and discern whether defective clearance is responsible for protein aggregate accumulation (zrelski2025impairedautophagicflux pages 13-16). Although direct examples from IBM models are less common, multiple reports using patient-derived fibroblasts and iPSC-derived myotubes have shown that autophagic dysfunction is a replicable feature of IBM pathology. Furthermore, such assays have facilitated the screening of autophagy inducers and lysosomal enhancers that could restore normal flux and potentially ameliorate muscle pathology (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2). The underlying principle has also been validated in studies of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy and other inflammatory myopathies, where similar approaches validated the association between altered autophagic dynamics and muscle degeneration (girolamo2019autophagymarkerslc3 pages 12-18).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths:  \n• The assay offers a dynamic and quantifiable assessment of autophagic flux by distinguishing between autophagosome synthesis and degradation.  \n• It provides multiparametric data that are crucial when screening drugs aimed at enhancing autophagy, which is a central pathological mechanism in IBM.  \n• Adaptation in iPSC-derived myotubes increases physiological relevance given the complex muscle-specific features of IBM, while usage in fibroblasts offers a cost-effective and patient-specific model (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).\n\nWeaknesses:  \n• Overexpression of fluorescent reporters like GFP‐LC3 can potentially introduce artifacts or alter basal autophagic activity.  \n• Cellular heterogeneity between fibroblasts and muscle cells may limit the direct translational relevance, necessitating careful model selection and validation.  \n• The indirect nature of flux inhibition by bafilomycin A1 may mask nuanced differences in selective versus general autophagic pathways, implying that complementary assays (e.g., assessing specific cargo clearance) might be necessary (margeta2020autophagydefectsin pages 17-19, zrelski2025impairedautophagicflux pages 13-16).\n\nIn summary, the GFP‐LC3 cleavage and puncta formation assay with bafilomycin A1 is a scientifically robust and translationally relevant approach for screening autophagy-modulating therapeutics in IBM.

In addition, inflammatory cytokines prevalent in IBM not only contribute to muscle damage but also exacerbate kinase activation, particularly GSK-3β and CDK5, which in turn drive tau phosphorylation. Consequently, monitoring tau phosphorylation levels is highly relevant for both understanding disease mechanisms and evaluating therapeutic efficacy. Clinical evidence, including a pilot trial in IBM patients using lithium (a GSK-3β inhibitor), underscores the potential impact of regulating tau phosphorylation on disease pathology, thereby reinforcing the assay’s relevance (NCT00917956; piazzi2021revisitingtherole pages 8-10).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nPhospho-tau quantification assays, utilizing techniques such as ELISA and AlphaLISA, have been extensively applied in the context of neurodegenerative diseases to monitor disease progression and assess therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing tau hyperphosphorylation.

Moreover, initial clinical studies in IBM have demonstrated the feasibility of assessing phosphorylated tau levels in muscle biopsies before and after treatment, re-emphasizing that such assay platforms can be repurposed for IBM therapeutic screening (Clinical Trials Search: phosphorylated tau AND inclusion body myositis; zhang2020anovelapplication pages 1-3).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the phospho-tau quantification assay include its high sensitivity and quantitative nature, allowing for precise measurement of pathological tau forms that are directly linked to disease progression. The assay’s ability to screen small-molecule modulators of kinases like GSK-3β and CDK5 is particularly valuable, given the established involvement of these enzymes in IBM pathology. Additionally, an ELISA or AlphaLISA platform is amenable to high-throughput screening, which is critical in early-stage drug discovery and mechanistic studies (magalhaes2024naturalantitauautoantibodies pages 32-35).\n\nHowever, the assay also faces potential challenges. The heterogeneity of tau pathology in IBM tissue—where not all patients exhibit phosphorylated tau inclusions uniformly—could complicate data interpretation.

Integration with additional biomarkers (e.g., inflammatory markers) may be necessary to provide a comprehensive evaluation of therapeutic effects.\n\nIn conclusion, given the substantial biomedical and clinical evidence linking tau hyperphosphorylation to IBM pathogenesis, and the successful application of phospho-tau assays in related neurodegenerative contexts, this assay represents a valuable tool for screening and validating candidate therapeutics for IBM (piazzi2021revisitingtherole pages 6-8, russell2021generationandcharacterization pages 1-3).', 'index': '1'}","{'hypothesis': 'Immune co-culture apoptosis assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis proposal centers on an immune co-culture apoptosis assay designed to recapitulate a central aspect of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) pathogenesis—namely, the direct cytotoxic interaction between autologous CD8+ T cells and muscle fibers. In this assay, primary human myotubes are co-cultured with patient-derived, antigen-exposed CD8+ T cells in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α. The addition of these cytokines mimics the IBM muscle microenvironment by upregulating MHC class I expression on myotubes, thereby increasing their susceptibility to immune-mediated attack. This set-up is intended to trigger cell death, which is quantified via high-content imaging through markers such as cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL positivity. The use of primary human cells allows the assay to capture the patient-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses reflective of the antigen-driven, oligoclonal expansion seen in IBM muscle tissue (benveniste2015amyloiddepositsand pages 4-6, benveniste2019inclusionbodymyositis pages 2-3).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe inflammatory and degenerative interplay in IBM is characterized by the infiltration of highly differentiated CD8+ T cells, which express cytotoxic molecules such as perforin, granzymes, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (britson2020thereandback pages 12-17, damian2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 3-5). This cellular component is central to IBM pathogenesis, as these T cells engage in direct cytotoxic interactions with muscle fibers that overexpress MHC class I under the influence of IFN-γ and TNF-α (bhattarai2017functionalroleof pages 19-24, guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 13-15). The assay’s focus on apoptosis detection (cleaved caspase-3 or TUNEL) aligns with observed immune-mediated muscle fiber injury, despite some debate whether the predominant mode of cell death is apoptotic or necroptotic (kamiya2023musclefibernecroptosis pages 2-3, mccord2023cytotoxicimmunecells pages 1-2). Importantly, clinical and pathological analyses highlight that the antigen recognition by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells drives muscle damage and may be a key trigger for downstream degenerative processes (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 27-28, nelke2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 1-2). This assay therefore models a pathogenic mechanism that is both immunologically and clinically relevant.\n\nPrevious Use:  \nCo-culture systems involving myotubes and cytotoxic T cells have been used in earlier studies to investigate the direct effects of immune cell infiltration on muscle cells. For instance, in vitro models employing similar co-culture settings have demonstrated that CD8+ T cells can induce muscle cell apoptosis, as evidenced by cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL positivity (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 153-157). Such assays have played a role in elucidating the involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic T cell-induced muscle damage in IBM.

Furthermore, the inflammatory milieu characteristic of IBM, driven by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, exacerbates mitochondrial damage. This is mechanistically relevant because inflammatory mediators not only impair mitochondrial dynamics but also directly induce mitochondrial membrane potential loss, leading to reduced energy production and increased apoptotic susceptibility (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 25-29, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 64-64).

The methodology relies on fluorogenic peptides that emit a fluorescent signal upon cleavage by the active proteasome. The assay is conducted using lysates from cultured muscle cells or patient‐derived muscle fibers that exhibit the protein aggregate formation characteristic of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). The readouts offer quantitative data reflective of the ubiquitin–proteasome system’s (UPS) functionality, which is essential for degrading misfolded or damaged proteins (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8, nogalska2010inaβpp‐overexpressingcultured pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central pathology of IBM involves abnormal protein aggregation and impaired muscle proteostasis. These features are linked to dysfunction of the UPS, as evidenced by the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, misfolded protein aggregates, and decreased enzymatic activities within the proteasome. Biochemical studies show that in both sporadic and inclusion body variants of myositis, impaired proteasome function correlates with disease severity. This link is supported by literature documenting reduced proteolytic capacities in IBM muscle tissue, which contributes directly to cellular stress and muscle fiber degeneration (ahmed2016targetingproteinhomeostasis pages 1-3, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 13-14). Clinically, muscle biopsies from IBM patients reveal aggregation of proteins that are normally cleared by the proteasome, reinforcing the relevance of assessing proteasome activity as a measure of disease status and therapeutic response (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nProteasome catalytic activity assays have been applied extensively in the study of neuromuscular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders where UPS impairment is a hallmark. In vitro models simulating IBM have employed these fluorogenic peptide assays to demonstrate how proteasome inhibition leads to toxic protein accumulation. For instance, studies using cultured human muscle fibers overexpressing proteins such as amyloid‐β precursor protein (AβPP) have confirmed that diminished proteasome activity is closely linked to the pathogenesis seen in IBM (nogalska2010inaβpp‐overexpressingcultured pages 1-2). Moreover, similar assays have been used in drug screening applications in other models of protein aggregation disorders, where compounds that restore proteasome activity were identified as promising candidates for ameliorating aggregate accumulation. Although clinical trials with direct measurements of proteasome activity in IBM are sparse (Clinical Trials Search: proteasome activity AND Inclusion Body Myositis), the preclinical use of this assay in comparable disease models validates its utility for drug discovery (li2013unfoldedproteinresponse pages 1-2).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the proteasome catalytic activity assay include its direct measurement of a key enzymatic process central to IBM pathogenesis, rapid plate-based format, and quantitative output that supports high-throughput drug screening. By providing a functional readout of UPS integrity, it can serve as a surrogate marker for therapeutic efficacy in early-stage in vitro models, correlating improvements in proteasome activity with potential reductions in pathogenic protein aggregates (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8). On the other hand, a significant weakness is that the UPS is only one facet of the multifactorial pathogenesis of IBM. The disease also involves autophagy dysfunction, inflammatory responses, and other cellular stress pathways; therefore, relying solely on proteasome activity may not fully capture the therapeutic benefits of a candidate compound (ju2010inclusionbodymyopathy pages 5-6). Additionally, while in vitro models provide controlled conditions, translating these findings into in vivo efficacy remains a challenge due to the complex interplay of muscle degeneration and immune responses in patients (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 23-24).

In vitro drug screening efforts have evaluated compounds that reduce β-APP-induced toxicity, with successes demonstrated by decreased inclusion formation and improved proteasomal activity upon BACE inhibition. These precedents provide a solid foundation, indicating that a rapid fluorogenic assay for BACE activity under inflammatory conditions is amenable to early-stage drug discovery and validation in sIBM (ahmed2012investigatingnoveltherapeutic pages 225-230, catalangarcia2015bace1ps1and pages 7-7).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nA primary strength of this assay is its focus on a molecular event—BACE-mediated APP cleavage—that underpins a central aspect of sIBM pathogenesis, particularly in the context of inflammation-triggered amyloidogenic processing. The rapid, quantifiable fluorescent readout provides a sensitive tool for high-throughput screening of drug candidates. Additionally, using human myotubes enhances the assay’s physiological relevance, and stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokines further mirrors the complex pathological environment of sIBM.  \n\nHowever, the assay has limitations. sIBM is a multifactorial disease involving not only amyloidogenic mechanisms but also mitochondrial dysfunction, proteasome impairment, and immune-related processes. Relying solely on BACE activity as a readout may overlook effects of candidate drugs on other key pathogenic pathways. Moreover, variability in cytokine responses and transfection efficiency in primary muscle cultures can introduce experimental variability that must be carefully controlled (ahmed2012investigatingnoveltherapeutic pages 126-131, garcia2017mitochondrialprofileand pages 60-62). Ultimately, while the assay is robust for assessing the modulation of amyloidogenic APP processing, it is best integrated into a multi-assay platform that evaluates other degenerative and inflammatory markers to comprehensively address sIBM pathology (garcia2017mitochondrialprofileand pages 74-80).', 'index': '0'}","{'hypothesis': 'Phospho-tau quantification assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis phospho-tau quantification assay is designed to measure the pathological phosphorylation state of tau protein in muscle cells, a critical hallmark of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). The assay employs either AlphaLISA or ELISA methodologies that target specific phosphorylated tau epitopes (e.g., p-Ser202/Thr205) to provide a sensitive, plate-based readout of tau phosphorylation levels. The proposed model uses cytokine-treated muscle cells to simulate the inflammatory environment observed in IBM, thereby inducing aberrant tau phosphorylation mediated by kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). By applying small-molecule modulators to these cell cultures, one can directly assess therapeutic intervention effects on tau hyperphosphorylation. The biological material for this assay includes established muscle cell models—such as C2C12 myoblasts—or potentially even alternative models where human tau is expressed in muscle (as supported by studies using C. elegans muscle models) (Clinical Trials Search: phosphorylated tau AND inclusion body myositis, NCT00917956; russell2021generationandcharacterization pages 5-7).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nPathologically, IBM is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and intracellular protein inclusions containing phosphorylated tau, similar to tauopathies in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. The hyperphosphorylation of tau is central to inclusion formation by inducing its detachment from microtubules and subsequent aggregation, leading to cellular dysfunction. In addition, inflammatory cytokines prevalent in IBM not only contribute to muscle damage but also exacerbate kinase activation, particularly GSK-3β and CDK5, which in turn drive tau phosphorylation. Consequently, monitoring tau phosphorylation levels is highly relevant for both understanding disease mechanisms and evaluating therapeutic efficacy. Clinical evidence, including a pilot trial in IBM patients using lithium (a GSK-3β inhibitor), underscores the potential impact of regulating tau phosphorylation on disease pathology, thereby reinforcing the assay’s relevance (NCT00917956; piazzi2021revisitingtherole pages 8-10).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nPhospho-tau quantification assays, utilizing techniques such as ELISA and AlphaLISA, have been extensively applied in the context of neurodegenerative diseases to monitor disease progression and assess therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing tau hyperphosphorylation. Specifically, in Alzheimer’s disease research, these assays have identified alterations in tau phosphorylation in response to kinase modulators, thereby validating their utility in a high-throughput screening context. Moreover, initial clinical studies in IBM have demonstrated the feasibility of assessing phosphorylated tau levels in muscle biopsies before and after treatment, re-emphasizing that such assay platforms can be repurposed for IBM therapeutic screening (Clinical Trials Search: phosphorylated tau AND inclusion body myositis; zhang2020anovelapplication pages 1-3).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the phospho-tau quantification assay include its high sensitivity and quantitative nature, allowing for precise measurement of pathological tau forms that are directly linked to disease progression. The assay’s ability to screen small-molecule modulators of kinases like GSK-3β and CDK5 is particularly valuable, given the established involvement of these enzymes in IBM pathology. Additionally, an ELISA or AlphaLISA platform is amenable to high-throughput screening, which is critical in early-stage drug discovery and mechanistic studies (magalhaes2024naturalantitauautoantibodies pages 32-35).\n\nHowever, the assay also faces potential challenges. The heterogeneity of tau pathology in IBM tissue—where not all patients exhibit phosphorylated tau inclusions uniformly—could complicate data interpretation. Furthermore, while the inflammatory context simulated through cytokine treatment enhances relevance, it may also introduce variability due to the complex interplay between immune responses and kinase activity in muscle cells (piazzi2021revisitingtherole pages 1-3). Integration with additional biomarkers (e.g., inflammatory markers) may be necessary to provide a comprehensive evaluation of therapeutic effects.\n\nIn conclusion, given the substantial biomedical and clinical evidence linking tau hyperphosphorylation to IBM pathogenesis, and the successful application of phospho-tau assays in related neurodegenerative contexts, this assay represents a valuable tool for screening and validating candidate therapeutics for IBM (piazzi2021revisitingtherole pages 6-8, russell2021generationandcharacterization pages 1-3).', 'index': '1'}"
"(Autophagic flux imaging assay, 7)","(Proteasome catalytic activity assay, 8)","Both assays target key proteostasis pathways implicated in Inclusion Body Myositis. Candidate 1 (Autophagic flux imaging assay) directly measures the dynamic process of autophagosome formation and clearance using GFP-LC3 reporter puncta in live cells, ideally in iPSC-derived myotubes that recapitulate muscle-specific pathology. This assay aligns with strong evidence that defective autophagy underlies IBM pathogenesis and offers multiparametric, time-resolved data on autophagic flux in response to candidate drugs. Limitations include potential artifacts from overexpressed fluorescent reporters, requirement for live-cell imaging infrastructure, and the need to complement with specific cargo clearance assays. Candidate 2 (Proteasome catalytic activity assay) uses a simple plate-based fluorogenic peptide readout to quantify chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like activities of the 26S proteasome in muscle cell lysates. It is rapid, high-throughput, and directly measures UPS function—a pathway also disrupted in IBM. However, it only addresses one arm of proteostasis, lacks cellular context and dynamic flux information, and may not predict functional clearance of aggregated proteins or capture autophagy–UPS crosstalk and inflammatory components of IBM.","The autophagic flux imaging assay (Candidate 1) is superior because it interrogates a central and well-validated pathogenic mechanism in IBM—defective autophagy—using a functionally relevant, dynamic readout in muscle-like cells. Although technically more complex, it provides richer mechanistic insight and directly gauges therapeutic modulation of autophagy, which is more closely tied to IBM muscle degeneration than proteasome activity alone. The proteasome assay is simpler but too narrow in scope to serve as the primary in vitro screen for IBM drug candidates.",19,"(7, 8)","{'hypothesis': 'Autophagic flux imaging assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThe proposed autophagic flux imaging assay involves live‐cell imaging of GFP‐LC3 cleavage and puncta formation under both basal conditions and in the presence of bafilomycin A1, a lysosomal inhibitor. This assay directly measures the dynamics of autophagy by assessing autophagosome formation and clearance. The use of a fluorescent LC3 reporter enables visualization of autophagosome accumulation, where an increase in puncta upon bafilomycin A1 treatment indicates active flux. In the context of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), this assay would typically be applied to muscle-related cells such as myotubes—especially those derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to better recapitulate muscle-specific pathology—or patient-derived fibroblasts which have also demonstrated autophagic dysfunction. The assay quantitatively determines the rate at which autophagosomes are generated and degraded over time when challenged with proteostatic stress (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nImpaired autophagy plays a central role in the pathogenesis of IBM. Multiple independent studies have highlighted defects in autophagosome formation and accumulation of autophagy-related markers such as LC3B-II and p62 in both muscle tissue and patient-derived fibroblasts. Reduced autophagic activity leads to insufficient clearance of damaged proteins and organelles, propagating cellular stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately muscle degeneration (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2). The clinical landscape underscores that targeting autophagy modulation may have therapeutic benefits, as conventional immunosuppressive treatments have shown limited efficacy, and there is significant interest in drugs that restore proteostasis (Clinical Trial Search: autophagy OR lysosomal enhancement OR proteostasis OR autophagic flux AND myositis OR muscle myopathy). Therefore, assessing autophagic flux using GFP‐LC3 reporter assays directly relates to a core pathogenic mechanism in IBM. By quantitatively measuring dynamic changes in autophagic flux, researchers can determine if candidate drugs enhance the autophagy pathway and promote the removal of toxic aggregates, which is essential for halting or reversing muscle degeneration in IBM (margeta2020autophagydefectsin pages 17-19, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 66-67).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nThe GFP‐LC3 puncta assay, in combination with bafilomycin A1, has been widely used in autophagy research, including in the evaluation of muscle diseases and related myopathies. Prior studies in models of skeletal myopathy—including plectin-deficient muscle cells—have employed similar approaches to delineate autophagic flux and discern whether defective clearance is responsible for protein aggregate accumulation (zrelski2025impairedautophagicflux pages 13-16). Although direct examples from IBM models are less common, multiple reports using patient-derived fibroblasts and iPSC-derived myotubes have shown that autophagic dysfunction is a replicable feature of IBM pathology. Furthermore, such assays have facilitated the screening of autophagy inducers and lysosomal enhancers that could restore normal flux and potentially ameliorate muscle pathology (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2). The underlying principle has also been validated in studies of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy and other inflammatory myopathies, where similar approaches validated the association between altered autophagic dynamics and muscle degeneration (girolamo2019autophagymarkerslc3 pages 12-18).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths:  \n• The assay offers a dynamic and quantifiable assessment of autophagic flux by distinguishing between autophagosome synthesis and degradation.  \n• It provides multiparametric data that are crucial when screening drugs aimed at enhancing autophagy, which is a central pathological mechanism in IBM.  \n• Adaptation in iPSC-derived myotubes increases physiological relevance given the complex muscle-specific features of IBM, while usage in fibroblasts offers a cost-effective and patient-specific model (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).\n\nWeaknesses:  \n• Overexpression of fluorescent reporters like GFP‐LC3 can potentially introduce artifacts or alter basal autophagic activity.  \n• Cellular heterogeneity between fibroblasts and muscle cells may limit the direct translational relevance, necessitating careful model selection and validation.  \n• The indirect nature of flux inhibition by bafilomycin A1 may mask nuanced differences in selective versus general autophagic pathways, implying that complementary assays (e.g., assessing specific cargo clearance) might be necessary (margeta2020autophagydefectsin pages 17-19, zrelski2025impairedautophagicflux pages 13-16).\n\nIn summary, the GFP‐LC3 cleavage and puncta formation assay with bafilomycin A1 is a scientifically robust and translationally relevant approach for screening autophagy-modulating therapeutics in IBM. Its strengths in measuring dynamic autophagic flux align well with the pathophysiological features of IBM, although careful attention to model selection and assay optimization is required to overcome inherent limitations.', 'index': '7'}","{'hypothesis': 'Proteasome catalytic activity assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis assay is a plate‐based measurement of proteasome catalytic activity in muscle cell lysates. It focuses on quantifying the three primary proteolytic activities mediated by the 26S proteasome: chymotrypsin‐like, trypsin‐like, and caspase‐like (also referred to as PGPH in some literature). The methodology relies on fluorogenic peptides that emit a fluorescent signal upon cleavage by the active proteasome. The assay is conducted using lysates from cultured muscle cells or patient‐derived muscle fibers that exhibit the protein aggregate formation characteristic of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). The readouts offer quantitative data reflective of the ubiquitin–proteasome system’s (UPS) functionality, which is essential for degrading misfolded or damaged proteins (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8, nogalska2010inaβpp‐overexpressingcultured pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central pathology of IBM involves abnormal protein aggregation and impaired muscle proteostasis. These features are linked to dysfunction of the UPS, as evidenced by the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, misfolded protein aggregates, and decreased enzymatic activities within the proteasome. Biochemical studies show that in both sporadic and inclusion body variants of myositis, impaired proteasome function correlates with disease severity. This link is supported by literature documenting reduced proteolytic capacities in IBM muscle tissue, which contributes directly to cellular stress and muscle fiber degeneration (ahmed2016targetingproteinhomeostasis pages 1-3, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 13-14). Clinically, muscle biopsies from IBM patients reveal aggregation of proteins that are normally cleared by the proteasome, reinforcing the relevance of assessing proteasome activity as a measure of disease status and therapeutic response (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nProteasome catalytic activity assays have been applied extensively in the study of neuromuscular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders where UPS impairment is a hallmark. In vitro models simulating IBM have employed these fluorogenic peptide assays to demonstrate how proteasome inhibition leads to toxic protein accumulation. For instance, studies using cultured human muscle fibers overexpressing proteins such as amyloid‐β precursor protein (AβPP) have confirmed that diminished proteasome activity is closely linked to the pathogenesis seen in IBM (nogalska2010inaβpp‐overexpressingcultured pages 1-2). Moreover, similar assays have been used in drug screening applications in other models of protein aggregation disorders, where compounds that restore proteasome activity were identified as promising candidates for ameliorating aggregate accumulation. Although clinical trials with direct measurements of proteasome activity in IBM are sparse (Clinical Trials Search: proteasome activity AND Inclusion Body Myositis), the preclinical use of this assay in comparable disease models validates its utility for drug discovery (li2013unfoldedproteinresponse pages 1-2).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the proteasome catalytic activity assay include its direct measurement of a key enzymatic process central to IBM pathogenesis, rapid plate-based format, and quantitative output that supports high-throughput drug screening. By providing a functional readout of UPS integrity, it can serve as a surrogate marker for therapeutic efficacy in early-stage in vitro models, correlating improvements in proteasome activity with potential reductions in pathogenic protein aggregates (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8). On the other hand, a significant weakness is that the UPS is only one facet of the multifactorial pathogenesis of IBM. The disease also involves autophagy dysfunction, inflammatory responses, and other cellular stress pathways; therefore, relying solely on proteasome activity may not fully capture the therapeutic benefits of a candidate compound (ju2010inclusionbodymyopathy pages 5-6). Additionally, while in vitro models provide controlled conditions, translating these findings into in vivo efficacy remains a challenge due to the complex interplay of muscle degeneration and immune responses in patients (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 23-24). In summary, when used as part of a broader panel of assays, the proteasome catalytic activity assay is a scientifically robust and practically valuable tool for early-stage drug discovery in IBM (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8, nogalska2010inaβpp‐overexpressingcultured pages 1-2).', 'index': '8'}"
"(Mitochondrial membrane potential assay, 3)","(UPR reporter assay, 4)","Candidate 1 (Mitochondrial membrane potential assay) and Candidate 2 (UPR reporter assay) both address key pathological nodes in IBM but differ in direct functional readout, biological relevance, and assay complexity. The mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) assay uses human skeletal muscle cells exposed to proinflammatory cytokines to replicate IBM’s inflammatory and mitochondrial dysfunction milieu. It provides a direct, quantitative measure of mitochondrial health (Δψm) via TMRE or JC-1 dyes, correlating with ATP production and ROS generation. This readout is a proximal functional endpoint central to muscle bioenergetics and early pathogenesis in IBM. The approach is adaptable to live-cell imaging, high-throughput formats, and uses disease-relevant cell types, enhancing translational relevance. Potential limitations include dye loading variability, photobleaching, and the need to complement with assays capturing chronic multifactorial pathology. Conversely, the UPR reporter assay employs stable XBP1-luciferase or CHOP-GFP reporters in myoblasts to detect ER stress and proteostasis imbalance. It offers high sensitivity, quantifiable luminescence or fluorescence, and mechanistic insight into UPR branch activation. However, it measures a more distal stress response rather than a primary functional deficit, and does not directly assess downstream events like protein aggregation or mitochondrial compromise. While valuable for mechanistic screens, it provides an indirect readout of pathology and requires secondary assays for functional validation. Compared against the mitochondrial assay, the UPR reporter introduces an additional layer of abstraction and may fail to capture the bioenergetic deficits that drive muscle degeneration in IBM.","Given the goal of prioritizing simple, rapid, biologically relevant in vitro assays with direct functional endpoints, the mitochondrial membrane potential assay is superior.

Furthermore, the inflammatory milieu characteristic of IBM, driven by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, exacerbates mitochondrial damage. This is mechanistically relevant because inflammatory mediators not only impair mitochondrial dynamics but also directly induce mitochondrial membrane potential loss, leading to reduced energy production and increased apoptotic susceptibility (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 25-29, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 64-64). The use of TMRE or JC-1 staining in this context offers a direct method to assess these mitochondrial changes in real-time, linking the biochemical defect to the clinical pathology of muscle degeneration observed in IBM (Open Targets Search: Inclusion Body Myositis).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nMitochondrial membrane potential assays employing TMRE and JC-1 have been extensively used in the context of various muscle pathologies and models of inflammation.

The assay quantifies BACE-mediated cleavage of APP using a fluorogenic substrate that yields a rapid fluorescent readout, directly reflecting the production of the toxic Aβ42 peptide. Human myotubes, representing the target muscle cell type, are employed to provide a biologically pertinent platform to test candidate drugs aimed at modulating this cleavage event (ahmed2012investigatingnoveltherapeutic pages 237-241).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nAmyloidogenic processing of APP via cleavage by BACE-1 is becoming recognized as a central mechanism contributing to sIBM pathology. Elevated levels of BACE-1 and abnormal APP processing correlate with intracellular accumulation of amyloid beta peptides and inclusion body formation in sIBM muscle fibers. Clinical and biochemical data have shown significant increases in amyloidogenic markers such as BACE-1, presenilin-1, and soluble APPβ in sIBM patients’ plasma, distinguishing the disease from other inflammatory myopathies. These findings strongly support the concept that an inflammatory microenvironment, as simulated by IFN-γ and IL-1β stimulation, can enhance the amyloidogenic pathway and directly contribute to muscle degeneration in sIBM (catalangarcia2015bace1ps1and pages 1-2, garcia2017mitochondrialprofileand pages 29-33).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nAssays measuring BACE activity have been employed in neurodegenerative research, particularly in Alzheimer’s disease, as well as in muscle cell culture models for sIBM.

In vitro drug screening efforts have evaluated compounds that reduce β-APP-induced toxicity, with successes demonstrated by decreased inclusion formation and improved proteasomal activity upon BACE inhibition.

This assay directly measures the dynamics of autophagy by assessing autophagosome formation and clearance. The use of a fluorescent LC3 reporter enables visualization of autophagosome accumulation, where an increase in puncta upon bafilomycin A1 treatment indicates active flux. In the context of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), this assay would typically be applied to muscle-related cells such as myotubes—especially those derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to better recapitulate muscle-specific pathology—or patient-derived fibroblasts which have also demonstrated autophagic dysfunction. The assay quantitatively determines the rate at which autophagosomes are generated and degraded over time when challenged with proteostatic stress (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nImpaired autophagy plays a central role in the pathogenesis of IBM. Multiple independent studies have highlighted defects in autophagosome formation and accumulation of autophagy-related markers such as LC3B-II and p62 in both muscle tissue and patient-derived fibroblasts. Reduced autophagic activity leads to insufficient clearance of damaged proteins and organelles, propagating cellular stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately muscle degeneration (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2). The clinical landscape underscores that targeting autophagy modulation may have therapeutic benefits, as conventional immunosuppressive treatments have shown limited efficacy, and there is significant interest in drugs that restore proteostasis (Clinical Trial Search: autophagy OR lysosomal enhancement OR proteostasis OR autophagic flux AND myositis OR muscle myopathy). Therefore, assessing autophagic flux using GFP‐LC3 reporter assays directly relates to a core pathogenic mechanism in IBM. By quantitatively measuring dynamic changes in autophagic flux, researchers can determine if candidate drugs enhance the autophagy pathway and promote the removal of toxic aggregates, which is essential for halting or reversing muscle degeneration in IBM (margeta2020autophagydefectsin pages 17-19, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 66-67).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nThe GFP‐LC3 puncta assay, in combination with bafilomycin A1, has been widely used in autophagy research, including in the evaluation of muscle diseases and related myopathies.

Although direct examples from IBM models are less common, multiple reports using patient-derived fibroblasts and iPSC-derived myotubes have shown that autophagic dysfunction is a replicable feature of IBM pathology. Furthermore, such assays have facilitated the screening of autophagy inducers and lysosomal enhancers that could restore normal flux and potentially ameliorate muscle pathology (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2). The underlying principle has also been validated in studies of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy and other inflammatory myopathies, where similar approaches validated the association between altered autophagic dynamics and muscle degeneration (girolamo2019autophagymarkerslc3 pages 12-18).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths:  \n• The assay offers a dynamic and quantifiable assessment of autophagic flux by distinguishing between autophagosome synthesis and degradation.  \n• It provides multiparametric data that are crucial when screening drugs aimed at enhancing autophagy, which is a central pathological mechanism in IBM.  \n• Adaptation in iPSC-derived myotubes increases physiological relevance given the complex muscle-specific features of IBM, while usage in fibroblasts offers a cost-effective and patient-specific model (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).\n\nWeaknesses:  \n• Overexpression of fluorescent reporters like GFP‐LC3 can potentially introduce artifacts or alter basal autophagic activity.  \n• Cellular heterogeneity between fibroblasts and muscle cells may limit the direct translational relevance, necessitating careful model selection and validation.  \n• The indirect nature of flux inhibition by bafilomycin A1 may mask nuanced differences in selective versus general autophagic pathways, implying that complementary assays (e.g., assessing specific cargo clearance) might be necessary (margeta2020autophagydefectsin pages 17-19, zrelski2025impairedautophagicflux pages 13-16).\n\nIn summary, the GFP‐LC3 cleavage and puncta formation assay with bafilomycin A1 is a scientifically robust and translationally relevant approach for screening autophagy-modulating therapeutics in IBM.

By providing a functional readout of UPS integrity, it can serve as a surrogate marker for therapeutic efficacy in early-stage in vitro models, correlating improvements in proteasome activity with potential reductions in pathogenic protein aggregates (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8).

Its compatibility with automated imaging in a 96-well plate lends itself to high-throughput screening, thereby accelerating early-stage drug discovery (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 232-235).  \nHowever, there are weaknesses to note. Overexpression of GFP-tagged TDP-43 may produce nonphysiological localization patterns or aggregation artifacts that do not fully recapitulate endogenous TDP-43 behavior (besnard‐guerin2020cytoplasmiclocalizationof pages 1-2).

The use of primary or differentiated human myotubes increases biological relevance, and the assay directly reports on toxic Aβ42 production, a hallmark of amyloid pathology in sIBM.

Automated high‐content imaging provides dynamic, cell‐based readouts of a key pathological event in IBM.

Clinical and biochemical data have shown significant increases in amyloidogenic markers such as BACE-1, presenilin-1, and soluble APPβ in sIBM patients’ plasma, distinguishing the disease from other inflammatory myopathies. These findings strongly support the concept that an inflammatory microenvironment, as simulated by IFN-γ and IL-1β stimulation, can enhance the amyloidogenic pathway and directly contribute to muscle degeneration in sIBM (catalangarcia2015bace1ps1and pages 1-2, garcia2017mitochondrialprofileand pages 29-33).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nAssays measuring BACE activity have been employed in neurodegenerative research, particularly in Alzheimer’s disease, as well as in muscle cell culture models for sIBM.

It is amenable to high‐throughput screening, provides real‐time luminescent/fluorescent readouts, and offers mechanistic insight into IRE1 and PERK branches of the UPR. However, it remains an upstream surrogate: it does not directly measure hallmark downstream IBM phenotypes such as aggregate formation or muscle cell dysfunction. Myoblast cultures lack the full tissue context, including inflammatory cues, and positive hits require extensive follow‐up in more complex models. Candidate 2 (High-content aggregate quantification) employs automated immunofluorescence and image segmentation in differentiated myoblasts or patient-derived/iPSC-derived myotubes to directly quantify amyloid-β oligomers, phospho-tau, and TDP-43 aggregates—the core IBM lesions.

It is designed to monitor the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a critical node in the pathogenesis of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), by providing quantifiable luminescent (via XBP1-luciferase) or fluorescent (via CHOP-GFP) outputs. The assay models a central aspect of IBM pathogenesis related to proteostasis dysfunction and ER stress, conditions that are critical in identifying pathogenic stimuli and screening potential therapeutic compounds. In practice, the reporter signal will be measured upon exposure of myoblast cultures to various stressors or proteostatic challenges (for example, chemical insults that promote misfolded protein accumulation), with signal changes indicating modulation of the UPR. The assay can be adapted to high-throughput screening formats, enabling rapid and quantitative analysis of chemical chaperones or UPR modulators that could ameliorate ER stress in IBM-relevant cell types (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 4-6, naitsaidi2023thesmallcompound pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThere is substantial biomedical evidence that ER stress and UPR activation are central to IBM pathogenesis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that markers of ER stress, such as spliced XBP1 (sXBP1) and CHOP, are elevated in IBM as well as other related myopathies, suggesting that proteostasis imbalance is a driving force in disease progression (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 15-18, ruparelia2024atrogin1promotesmuscle pages 18-19). Clinical analyses of muscle biopsies from IBM patients reveal elevated ER chaperones and stress markers, linking UPR activation to the formation of protein aggregates and vacuolar pathology characteristic of the disease (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 26-30, rusmini2016theroleof pages 13-17). This association is reinforced by genetic and immunohistochemical analyses showing that multiple branches of the UPR, including the IRE1-XBP1 pathway and the PERK-CHOP branch, contribute to the cellular response under stress conditions and regulate apoptotic as well as compensatory mechanisms in muscle, making the monitoring of these pathways highly relevant (krishna2023indicatorsofincreased pages 10-11).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nUPR reporter assays have been previously employed in various models of ER stress-linked pathologies. For instance, XBP1-luciferase constructs have been used to detect IRE1-mediated splicing events in different cell types and have served as quantitative indicators of the cellular response to proteotoxic stress (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 4-6). Similarly, CHOP-GFP assays have been utilized to monitor the pro-apoptotic signaling downstream of PERK activation and have provided insights into how modulation of this branch can impact cell viability and stress-induced apoptotic pathways (harish2019pharmacologicalmodulationof pages 32-35). Although direct application to IBM is underexplored in the literature, the widespread use of these reporters in drug discovery for other protein aggregation diseases underscores their potential utility in IBM research. They have enabled the identification of small molecules that modulate the UPR and restore proteostasis in models of related muscular dystrophies, suggesting that similar approaches could yield promising therapeutic candidates for IBM (naitsaidi2023thesmallcompound pages 1-2).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its high sensitivity and quantifiable output, which enables precise measurement of UPR activation in response to proteostatic challenges. The use of myoblasts as a model system is directly relevant because these cells capture key aspects of muscle pathology. Furthermore, the dual reporting capability (via luminescence or fluorescence) facilitates flexibility in high-throughput screening formats, essential for early-stage drug discovery. The assay allows for real-time monitoring of distinct UPR branches, thereby providing mechanistic insights into which specific pathways can be modulated to alleviate ER stress-related pathology.  \nHowever, weaknesses include the fact that in vitro cell culture systems may not fully recapitulate the complex tissue context of IBM, where additional factors such as inflammatory signaling and in vivo tissue architecture also play roles. Moreover, while reporter assays reliably quantify UPR activation, they do not directly measure downstream pathological events, such as protein aggregation or cell death, which are critical in IBM.

It is simple, amenable to 96-well formats, and directly probes a well‐documented molecular mechanism (elevated BACE-1 and Aβ accumulation) in sIBM pathology. However, it measures only one pathogenic axis (amyloid cleavage) and omits functional deficits. Cytokine responsiveness and primary myotube transfection can add variability, and the assay neglects muscle contractile performance and other degenerative pathways. Candidate 2 (myotube contractility assay) uses patient‐derived iPSCs differentiated into myotubes on flexible substrates with electrical stimulation and video‐based quantitation of contraction amplitude/frequency.

The rationale is to mimic the in vivo inflammatory environment seen in Inclusion Body Myositis (sIBM) while measuring amyloidogenic processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP). The assay quantifies BACE-mediated cleavage of APP using a fluorogenic substrate that yields a rapid fluorescent readout, directly reflecting the production of the toxic Aβ42 peptide. Human myotubes, representing the target muscle cell type, are employed to provide a biologically pertinent platform to test candidate drugs aimed at modulating this cleavage event (ahmed2012investigatingnoveltherapeutic pages 237-241).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nAmyloidogenic processing of APP via cleavage by BACE-1 is becoming recognized as a central mechanism contributing to sIBM pathology. Elevated levels of BACE-1 and abnormal APP processing correlate with intracellular accumulation of amyloid beta peptides and inclusion body formation in sIBM muscle fibers. Clinical and biochemical data have shown significant increases in amyloidogenic markers such as BACE-1, presenilin-1, and soluble APPβ in sIBM patients’ plasma, distinguishing the disease from other inflammatory myopathies. These findings strongly support the concept that an inflammatory microenvironment, as simulated by IFN-γ and IL-1β stimulation, can enhance the amyloidogenic pathway and directly contribute to muscle degeneration in sIBM (catalangarcia2015bace1ps1and pages 1-2, garcia2017mitochondrialprofileand pages 29-33).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nAssays measuring BACE activity have been employed in neurodegenerative research, particularly in Alzheimer’s disease, as well as in muscle cell culture models for sIBM. Prior studies have used β-APP over-expression models in myotubes to recapitulate inclusion body formation and proteasome dysfunction seen in sIBM, validating the role of amyloidogenic processing in muscle degeneration. In vitro drug screening efforts have evaluated compounds that reduce β-APP-induced toxicity, with successes demonstrated by decreased inclusion formation and improved proteasomal activity upon BACE inhibition. These precedents provide a solid foundation, indicating that a rapid fluorogenic assay for BACE activity under inflammatory conditions is amenable to early-stage drug discovery and validation in sIBM (ahmed2012investigatingnoveltherapeutic pages 225-230, catalangarcia2015bace1ps1and pages 7-7).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nA primary strength of this assay is its focus on a molecular event—BACE-mediated APP cleavage—that underpins a central aspect of sIBM pathogenesis, particularly in the context of inflammation-triggered amyloidogenic processing.

Additionally, using human myotubes enhances the assay’s physiological relevance, and stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokines further mirrors the complex pathological environment of sIBM.  \n\nHowever, the assay has limitations. sIBM is a multifactorial disease involving not only amyloidogenic mechanisms but also mitochondrial dysfunction, proteasome impairment, and immune-related processes. Relying solely on BACE activity as a readout may overlook effects of candidate drugs on other key pathogenic pathways. Moreover, variability in cytokine responses and transfection efficiency in primary muscle cultures can introduce experimental variability that must be carefully controlled (ahmed2012investigatingnoveltherapeutic pages 126-131, garcia2017mitochondrialprofileand pages 60-62). Ultimately, while the assay is robust for assessing the modulation of amyloidogenic APP processing, it is best integrated into a multi-assay platform that evaluates other degenerative and inflammatory markers to comprehensively address sIBM pathology (garcia2017mitochondrialprofileand pages 74-80).', 'index': '0'}","{'hypothesis': 'Myotube contractility assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis myotube contractility assay is designed to measure the functional contractile properties of iPSC‐derived myotubes cultured on flexible substrates.

The measured endpoints provide a functional readout of muscle cell performance, which is critical given that Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and impaired contractility. The biological material used is patient‐derived iPSCs that are differentiated into myotubes; these cells retain patient-specific genetic and molecular signatures representative of IBM pathology, offering high biomedical relevance (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 1-2, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central pathogenesis of IBM involves not only structural changes like rimmed vacuoles and protein aggregation but also a clear functional consequence—diminished contractile force in muscle fibers, which translates clinically to progressive weakness and decline in daily function.

The proposed model uses cytokine-treated muscle cells to simulate the inflammatory environment observed in IBM, thereby inducing aberrant tau phosphorylation mediated by kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). By applying small-molecule modulators to these cell cultures, one can directly assess therapeutic intervention effects on tau hyperphosphorylation. The biological material for this assay includes established muscle cell models—such as C2C12 myoblasts—or potentially even alternative models where human tau is expressed in muscle (as supported by studies using C. elegans muscle models) (Clinical Trials Search: phosphorylated tau AND inclusion body myositis, NCT00917956; russell2021generationandcharacterization pages 5-7).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nPathologically, IBM is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and intracellular protein inclusions containing phosphorylated tau, similar to tauopathies in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. The hyperphosphorylation of tau is central to inclusion formation by inducing its detachment from microtubules and subsequent aggregation, leading to cellular dysfunction. In addition, inflammatory cytokines prevalent in IBM not only contribute to muscle damage but also exacerbate kinase activation, particularly GSK-3β and CDK5, which in turn drive tau phosphorylation. Consequently, monitoring tau phosphorylation levels is highly relevant for both understanding disease mechanisms and evaluating therapeutic efficacy. Clinical evidence, including a pilot trial in IBM patients using lithium (a GSK-3β inhibitor), underscores the potential impact of regulating tau phosphorylation on disease pathology, thereby reinforcing the assay’s relevance (NCT00917956; piazzi2021revisitingtherole pages 8-10).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nPhospho-tau quantification assays, utilizing techniques such as ELISA and AlphaLISA, have been extensively applied in the context of neurodegenerative diseases to monitor disease progression and assess therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing tau hyperphosphorylation.

The methodology relies on fluorogenic peptides that emit a fluorescent signal upon cleavage by the active proteasome. The assay is conducted using lysates from cultured muscle cells or patient‐derived muscle fibers that exhibit the protein aggregate formation characteristic of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). The readouts offer quantitative data reflective of the ubiquitin–proteasome system’s (UPS) functionality, which is essential for degrading misfolded or damaged proteins (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8, nogalska2010inaβpp‐overexpressingcultured pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central pathology of IBM involves abnormal protein aggregation and impaired muscle proteostasis. These features are linked to dysfunction of the UPS, as evidenced by the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, misfolded protein aggregates, and decreased enzymatic activities within the proteasome. Biochemical studies show that in both sporadic and inclusion body variants of myositis, impaired proteasome function correlates with disease severity. This link is supported by literature documenting reduced proteolytic capacities in IBM muscle tissue, which contributes directly to cellular stress and muscle fiber degeneration (ahmed2016targetingproteinhomeostasis pages 1-3, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 13-14). Clinically, muscle biopsies from IBM patients reveal aggregation of proteins that are normally cleared by the proteasome, reinforcing the relevance of assessing proteasome activity as a measure of disease status and therapeutic response (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 7-8).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nProteasome catalytic activity assays have been applied extensively in the study of neuromuscular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders where UPS impairment is a hallmark.

On the other hand, a significant weakness is that the UPS is only one facet of the multifactorial pathogenesis of IBM. The disease also involves autophagy dysfunction, inflammatory responses, and other cellular stress pathways; therefore, relying solely on proteasome activity may not fully capture the therapeutic benefits of a candidate compound (ju2010inclusionbodymyopathy pages 5-6). Additionally, while in vitro models provide controlled conditions, translating these findings into in vivo efficacy remains a challenge due to the complex interplay of muscle degeneration and immune responses in patients (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 23-24).

The contractility assay offers greater simplicity, speed, and functional relevance, making it the better first‐line in vitro assay for therapeutic evaluation.",31,"(5, 6)","{'hypothesis': 'Myotube contractility assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis myotube contractility assay is designed to measure the functional contractile properties of iPSC‐derived myotubes cultured on flexible substrates. The assay applies electrical field stimulation to mimic in vivo muscle contraction and uses video‐based analysis software to quantitatively assess contraction amplitude and frequency. The measured endpoints provide a functional readout of muscle cell performance, which is critical given that Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and impaired contractility. The biological material used is patient‐derived iPSCs that are differentiated into myotubes; these cells retain patient-specific genetic and molecular signatures representative of IBM pathology, offering high biomedical relevance (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 1-2, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central pathogenesis of IBM involves not only structural changes like rimmed vacuoles and protein aggregation but also a clear functional consequence—diminished contractile force in muscle fibers, which translates clinically to progressive weakness and decline in daily function. Electrical stimulation of myotubes provides a physiologically relevant approach to mimic exercise-induced muscle contraction. Studies have shown that under electrical stimulus, even sIBM-derived myotubes reveal unusual responses such as abnormal cytoplasmic localization of TDP-43, a hallmark of disease that is not readily seen under static conditions (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 1-2, li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 11-12). Furthermore, contractility assays have been linked to functional outcomes that correlate with muscle strength in clinical settings, as seen in evaluations of interventions like high-dose IVIg, where improvements in muscle strength were required for therapeutic impact (NCT00001261). By continuing this line of inquiry, the assay is positioned to serve as a robust tool for screening drugs that can restore or improve contractile deficits in IBM (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 235-238, Clinical Trial Search: Inclusion Body Myositis AND (myotube OR muscle fiber OR in vitro OR contractility OR iPSC)).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nContractility assays employing electrically stimulated muscle cells have been widely used in the investigation of various muscle diseases, including but not limited to muscular dystrophies and myotonic disorders. Platforms such as the MyoTACTIC system have been successfully implemented to evaluate muscle force generation and calcium handling in engineered human muscle microtissues, underscoring the relevance of such functional assays in preclinical drug development (afshar2020a96wellculture pages 5-7). Although direct application of these assays to IBM is not as extensive, previous studies using feeder-supported satellite cell models have shown that exercise-mimicking stimulation protocols can reveal IBM-specific phenotypes, such as TDP-43 mislocalization upon contraction, demonstrating that contractile function is a measurable and disease-relevant endpoint (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 1-2). This supports the extrapolation of contractility assays for early-stage drug discovery in IBM, akin to how similar methodologies have informed mechanistic insights and pharmacological testing in other muscle diseases (broer2020canwemimic pages 2-4, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 69-73).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths:  \n• The assay directly measures a function—contractility—that is central to muscle performance and clinical manifestations of IBM. This offers a more relevant functional endpoint compared to indirect markers such as myotube diameter or myosin heavy chain expression (hamaguchi2022establishmentofa pages 1-2).  \n• Using patient-derived iPSC-derived myotubes ensures that the model captures patient-specific disease features, increasing the translational relevance for drug screening (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2).  \n• The non-invasive, video-based quantification method can be potentially scaled for medium-throughput screenings, expediting early-stage therapeutic discovery (afshar2020a96wellculture pages 5-7).\n\nWeaknesses:  \n• While the contractility assay is effective at quantifying muscle function, it may not fully replicate the multifactorial in vivo environment of IBM which includes significant contributions from immune-mediated inflammation and extracellular matrix interactions. In vitro systems generally lack immune and stromal components critical to IBM pathogenesis (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 235-238, broer2020canwemimic pages 2-4).  \n• Differentiation variability among iPSC lines may lead to heterogeneity in myotube maturation and contractile properties, posing challenges in assay standardization and reproducibility (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2).  \n• The focus on contractile function alone may overlook other important pathological features such as protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and autophagy impairment, which are also key in IBM (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 11-12, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 56-57).\n\nIn summary, the proposed electrically stimulated myotube contractility assay offers a robust, functionally relevant platform for early-stage IBM drug discovery by directly measuring muscle contraction deficits.

In this assay, primary human myotubes are co-cultured with patient-derived, antigen-exposed CD8+ T cells in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α. The addition of these cytokines mimics the IBM muscle microenvironment by upregulating MHC class I expression on myotubes, thereby increasing their susceptibility to immune-mediated attack. This set-up is intended to trigger cell death, which is quantified via high-content imaging through markers such as cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL positivity. The use of primary human cells allows the assay to capture the patient-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses reflective of the antigen-driven, oligoclonal expansion seen in IBM muscle tissue (benveniste2015amyloiddepositsand pages 4-6, benveniste2019inclusionbodymyositis pages 2-3).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe inflammatory and degenerative interplay in IBM is characterized by the infiltration of highly differentiated CD8+ T cells, which express cytotoxic molecules such as perforin, granzymes, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (britson2020thereandback pages 12-17, damian2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 3-5). This cellular component is central to IBM pathogenesis, as these T cells engage in direct cytotoxic interactions with muscle fibers that overexpress MHC class I under the influence of IFN-γ and TNF-α (bhattarai2017functionalroleof pages 19-24, guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 13-15). The assay’s focus on apoptosis detection (cleaved caspase-3 or TUNEL) aligns with observed immune-mediated muscle fiber injury, despite some debate whether the predominant mode of cell death is apoptotic or necroptotic (kamiya2023musclefibernecroptosis pages 2-3, mccord2023cytotoxicimmunecells pages 1-2). Importantly, clinical and pathological analyses highlight that the antigen recognition by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells drives muscle damage and may be a key trigger for downstream degenerative processes (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 27-28, nelke2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 1-2). This assay therefore models a pathogenic mechanism that is both immunologically and clinically relevant.\n\nPrevious Use:  \nCo-culture systems involving myotubes and cytotoxic T cells have been used in earlier studies to investigate the direct effects of immune cell infiltration on muscle cells. For instance, in vitro models employing similar co-culture settings have demonstrated that CD8+ T cells can induce muscle cell apoptosis, as evidenced by cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL positivity (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 153-157). Such assays have played a role in elucidating the involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic T cell-induced muscle damage in IBM. While direct correlation between in vitro findings and in vivo IBM pathology remains complex, these models have contributed to our understanding of the immunologic mechanisms underlying muscle fiber injury, informing the development of immunomodulators targeting the T cell–muscle cell axis (hou2021interferongammamediatesskeletal pages 11-14, danielsson2016theclinicaland pages 42-45).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths:  \n• The assay directly targets a well-characterized pathogenic mechanism in IBM—the CD8+ T cell–mediated cytotoxic attack on muscle fibers—thereby offering clear mechanistic insight into potential therapeutic interventions (benveniste2015amyloiddepositsand pages 4-6, britson2020thereandback pages 12-17).  \n• It employs primary human cells, which increases its physiological relevance and potential for personalized drug screening (nelke2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 1-2).  \n• The use of high-content imaging allows robust quantitative measurement of cell death, facilitating evaluation of therapeutic compounds aimed at mitigating immune-mediated cytotoxicity (mccord2023cytotoxicimmunecells pages 11-12).\n\nWeaknesses:  \n• There is ongoing debate regarding the exact mode of muscle fiber death in IBM, with some evidence suggesting that necroptosis rather than classical apoptosis may be predominant (kamiya2023musclefibernecroptosis pages 3-4). Thus, reliance solely on apoptotic markers might not fully recapitulate the in vivo pathology.  \n• The complex interplay between inflammatory cytokines, T-cell activation status, and muscle fiber stress may not be completely captured in vitro, potentially limiting the predictive validity of the assay for clinical responses (danielsson2016theclinicaland pages 42-45).\n\nOverall, the immune co-culture apoptosis assay represents a robust and scientifically grounded model for screening therapeutics targeting the T cell–mediated pathogenic axis of IBM. However, adaptations to also assess non-apoptotic cell death markers might enhance the assay’s capability to fully model IBM pathology and improve the translation of in vitro findings to clinical outcomes (damian2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 3-5, mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 153-157).', 'index': '6'}"

Furthermore, the inflammatory milieu characteristic of IBM, driven by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, exacerbates mitochondrial damage. This is mechanistically relevant because inflammatory mediators not only impair mitochondrial dynamics but also directly induce mitochondrial membrane potential loss, leading to reduced energy production and increased apoptotic susceptibility (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 25-29, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 64-64). The use of TMRE or JC-1 staining in this context offers a direct method to assess these mitochondrial changes in real-time, linking the biochemical defect to the clinical pathology of muscle degeneration observed in IBM (Open Targets Search: Inclusion Body Myositis).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nMitochondrial membrane potential assays employing TMRE and JC-1 have been extensively used in the context of various muscle pathologies and models of inflammation. In studies of IBM and other inflammatory myopathies, such assays have provided significant insights into mitochondrial bioenergetics and the effect of putative drugs on restoring mitochondrial function (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 56-57, oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 1-6). For example, experiments with drug candidates such as mitochondrial homing agents have shown improvements in ATP levels and reduction in ROS production in patient-derived myoblasts and fibroblasts, even if their effects were validated through a combination of morphological and bioenergetic analyses rather than solely Δψm measurements (oikawa2020mitochondrialdysfunctionunderlying pages 1-6, lightfoot2015ss31attenuatestnfα pages 6-11).

This assay directly measures the dynamics of autophagy by assessing autophagosome formation and clearance. The use of a fluorescent LC3 reporter enables visualization of autophagosome accumulation, where an increase in puncta upon bafilomycin A1 treatment indicates active flux. In the context of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), this assay would typically be applied to muscle-related cells such as myotubes—especially those derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to better recapitulate muscle-specific pathology—or patient-derived fibroblasts which have also demonstrated autophagic dysfunction. The assay quantitatively determines the rate at which autophagosomes are generated and degraded over time when challenged with proteostatic stress (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nImpaired autophagy plays a central role in the pathogenesis of IBM. Multiple independent studies have highlighted defects in autophagosome formation and accumulation of autophagy-related markers such as LC3B-II and p62 in both muscle tissue and patient-derived fibroblasts. Reduced autophagic activity leads to insufficient clearance of damaged proteins and organelles, propagating cellular stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately muscle degeneration (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2). The clinical landscape underscores that targeting autophagy modulation may have therapeutic benefits, as conventional immunosuppressive treatments have shown limited efficacy, and there is significant interest in drugs that restore proteostasis (Clinical Trial Search: autophagy OR lysosomal enhancement OR proteostasis OR autophagic flux AND myositis OR muscle myopathy). Therefore, assessing autophagic flux using GFP‐LC3 reporter assays directly relates to a core pathogenic mechanism in IBM. By quantitatively measuring dynamic changes in autophagic flux, researchers can determine if candidate drugs enhance the autophagy pathway and promote the removal of toxic aggregates, which is essential for halting or reversing muscle degeneration in IBM (margeta2020autophagydefectsin pages 17-19, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 66-67).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nThe GFP‐LC3 puncta assay, in combination with bafilomycin A1, has been widely used in autophagy research, including in the evaluation of muscle diseases and related myopathies. Prior studies in models of skeletal myopathy—including plectin-deficient muscle cells—have employed similar approaches to delineate autophagic flux and discern whether defective clearance is responsible for protein aggregate accumulation (zrelski2025impairedautophagicflux pages 13-16). Although direct examples from IBM models are less common, multiple reports using patient-derived fibroblasts and iPSC-derived myotubes have shown that autophagic dysfunction is a replicable feature of IBM pathology. Furthermore, such assays have facilitated the screening of autophagy inducers and lysosomal enhancers that could restore normal flux and potentially ameliorate muscle pathology (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2). The underlying principle has also been validated in studies of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy and other inflammatory myopathies, where similar approaches validated the association between altered autophagic dynamics and muscle degeneration (girolamo2019autophagymarkerslc3 pages 12-18).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths:  \n• The assay offers a dynamic and quantifiable assessment of autophagic flux by distinguishing between autophagosome synthesis and degradation.  \n• It provides multiparametric data that are crucial when screening drugs aimed at enhancing autophagy, which is a central pathological mechanism in IBM.  \n• Adaptation in iPSC-derived myotubes increases physiological relevance given the complex muscle-specific features of IBM, while usage in fibroblasts offers a cost-effective and patient-specific model (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).\n\nWeaknesses:  \n• Overexpression of fluorescent reporters like GFP‐LC3 can potentially introduce artifacts or alter basal autophagic activity.  \n• Cellular heterogeneity between fibroblasts and muscle cells may limit the direct translational relevance, necessitating careful model selection and validation.  \n• The indirect nature of flux inhibition by bafilomycin A1 may mask nuanced differences in selective versus general autophagic pathways, implying that complementary assays (e.g., assessing specific cargo clearance) might be necessary (margeta2020autophagydefectsin pages 17-19, zrelski2025impairedautophagicflux pages 13-16).\n\nIn summary, the GFP‐LC3 cleavage and puncta formation assay with bafilomycin A1 is a scientifically robust and translationally relevant approach for screening autophagy-modulating therapeutics in IBM. Its strengths in measuring dynamic autophagic flux align well with the pathophysiological features of IBM, although careful attention to model selection and assay optimization is required to overcome inherent limitations.', 'index': '7'}"

The proposed model uses cytokine-treated muscle cells to simulate the inflammatory environment observed in IBM, thereby inducing aberrant tau phosphorylation mediated by kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). By applying small-molecule modulators to these cell cultures, one can directly assess therapeutic intervention effects on tau hyperphosphorylation. The biological material for this assay includes established muscle cell models—such as C2C12 myoblasts—or potentially even alternative models where human tau is expressed in muscle (as supported by studies using C. elegans muscle models) (Clinical Trials Search: phosphorylated tau AND inclusion body myositis, NCT00917956; russell2021generationandcharacterization pages 5-7).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nPathologically, IBM is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and intracellular protein inclusions containing phosphorylated tau, similar to tauopathies in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. The hyperphosphorylation of tau is central to inclusion formation by inducing its detachment from microtubules and subsequent aggregation, leading to cellular dysfunction. In addition, inflammatory cytokines prevalent in IBM not only contribute to muscle damage but also exacerbate kinase activation, particularly GSK-3β and CDK5, which in turn drive tau phosphorylation. Consequently, monitoring tau phosphorylation levels is highly relevant for both understanding disease mechanisms and evaluating therapeutic efficacy. Clinical evidence, including a pilot trial in IBM patients using lithium (a GSK-3β inhibitor), underscores the potential impact of regulating tau phosphorylation on disease pathology, thereby reinforcing the assay’s relevance (NCT00917956; piazzi2021revisitingtherole pages 8-10).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nPhospho-tau quantification assays, utilizing techniques such as ELISA and AlphaLISA, have been extensively applied in the context of neurodegenerative diseases to monitor disease progression and assess therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing tau hyperphosphorylation.

The assay applies electrical field stimulation to mimic in vivo muscle contraction and uses video‐based analysis software to quantitatively assess contraction amplitude and frequency. The measured endpoints provide a functional readout of muscle cell performance, which is critical given that Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and impaired contractility. The biological material used is patient‐derived iPSCs that are differentiated into myotubes; these cells retain patient-specific genetic and molecular signatures representative of IBM pathology, offering high biomedical relevance (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 1-2, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central pathogenesis of IBM involves not only structural changes like rimmed vacuoles and protein aggregation but also a clear functional consequence—diminished contractile force in muscle fibers, which translates clinically to progressive weakness and decline in daily function. Electrical stimulation of myotubes provides a physiologically relevant approach to mimic exercise-induced muscle contraction. Studies have shown that under electrical stimulus, even sIBM-derived myotubes reveal unusual responses such as abnormal cytoplasmic localization of TDP-43, a hallmark of disease that is not readily seen under static conditions (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 1-2, li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 11-12). Furthermore, contractility assays have been linked to functional outcomes that correlate with muscle strength in clinical settings, as seen in evaluations of interventions like high-dose IVIg, where improvements in muscle strength were required for therapeutic impact (NCT00001261).

Platforms such as the MyoTACTIC system have been successfully implemented to evaluate muscle force generation and calcium handling in engineered human muscle microtissues, underscoring the relevance of such functional assays in preclinical drug development (afshar2020a96wellculture pages 5-7). Although direct application of these assays to IBM is not as extensive, previous studies using feeder-supported satellite cell models have shown that exercise-mimicking stimulation protocols can reveal IBM-specific phenotypes, such as TDP-43 mislocalization upon contraction, demonstrating that contractile function is a measurable and disease-relevant endpoint (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 1-2). This supports the extrapolation of contractility assays for early-stage drug discovery in IBM, akin to how similar methodologies have informed mechanistic insights and pharmacological testing in other muscle diseases (broer2020canwemimic pages 2-4, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 69-73).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths:  \n• The assay directly measures a function—contractility—that is central to muscle performance and clinical manifestations of IBM. This offers a more relevant functional endpoint compared to indirect markers such as myotube diameter or myosin heavy chain expression (hamaguchi2022establishmentofa pages 1-2).  \n• Using patient-derived iPSC-derived myotubes ensures that the model captures patient-specific disease features, increasing the translational relevance for drug screening (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2).  \n• The non-invasive, video-based quantification method can be potentially scaled for medium-throughput screenings, expediting early-stage therapeutic discovery (afshar2020a96wellculture pages 5-7).\n\nWeaknesses:  \n• While the contractility assay is effective at quantifying muscle function, it may not fully replicate the multifactorial in vivo environment of IBM which includes significant contributions from immune-mediated inflammation and extracellular matrix interactions. In vitro systems generally lack immune and stromal components critical to IBM pathogenesis (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 235-238, broer2020canwemimic pages 2-4).  \n• Differentiation variability among iPSC lines may lead to heterogeneity in myotube maturation and contractile properties, posing challenges in assay standardization and reproducibility (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2).  \n• The focus on contractile function alone may overlook other important pathological features such as protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and autophagy impairment, which are also key in IBM (li2022feedersupportedinvitro pages 11-12, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 56-57).\n\nIn summary, the proposed electrically stimulated myotube contractility assay offers a robust, functionally relevant platform for early-stage IBM drug discovery by directly measuring muscle contraction deficits.

Multiple studies have demonstrated that markers of ER stress, such as spliced XBP1 (sXBP1) and CHOP, are elevated in IBM as well as other related myopathies, suggesting that proteostasis imbalance is a driving force in disease progression (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 15-18, ruparelia2024atrogin1promotesmuscle pages 18-19).

This association is reinforced by genetic and immunohistochemical analyses showing that multiple branches of the UPR, including the IRE1-XBP1 pathway and the PERK-CHOP branch, contribute to the cellular response under stress conditions and regulate apoptotic as well as compensatory mechanisms in muscle, making the monitoring of these pathways highly relevant (krishna2023indicatorsofincreased pages 10-11).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nUPR reporter assays have been previously employed in various models of ER stress-linked pathologies.

Multiple studies have demonstrated that markers of ER stress, such as spliced XBP1 (sXBP1) and CHOP, are elevated in IBM as well as other related myopathies, suggesting that proteostasis imbalance is a driving force in disease progression (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 15-18, ruparelia2024atrogin1promotesmuscle pages 18-19). Clinical analyses of muscle biopsies from IBM patients reveal elevated ER chaperones and stress markers, linking UPR activation to the formation of protein aggregates and vacuolar pathology characteristic of the disease (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 26-30, rusmini2016theroleof pages 13-17). This association is reinforced by genetic and immunohistochemical analyses showing that multiple branches of the UPR, including the IRE1-XBP1 pathway and the PERK-CHOP branch, contribute to the cellular response under stress conditions and regulate apoptotic as well as compensatory mechanisms in muscle, making the monitoring of these pathways highly relevant (krishna2023indicatorsofincreased pages 10-11).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nUPR reporter assays have been previously employed in various models of ER stress-linked pathologies. For instance, XBP1-luciferase constructs have been used to detect IRE1-mediated splicing events in different cell types and have served as quantitative indicators of the cellular response to proteotoxic stress (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 4-6). Similarly, CHOP-GFP assays have been utilized to monitor the pro-apoptotic signaling downstream of PERK activation and have provided insights into how modulation of this branch can impact cell viability and stress-induced apoptotic pathways (harish2019pharmacologicalmodulationof pages 32-35). Although direct application to IBM is underexplored in the literature, the widespread use of these reporters in drug discovery for other protein aggregation diseases underscores their potential utility in IBM research. They have enabled the identification of small molecules that modulate the UPR and restore proteostasis in models of related muscular dystrophies, suggesting that similar approaches could yield promising therapeutic candidates for IBM (naitsaidi2023thesmallcompound pages 1-2).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of this assay include its high sensitivity and quantifiable output, which enables precise measurement of UPR activation in response to proteostatic challenges. The use of myoblasts as a model system is directly relevant because these cells capture key aspects of muscle pathology. Furthermore, the dual reporting capability (via luminescence or fluorescence) facilitates flexibility in high-throughput screening formats, essential for early-stage drug discovery. The assay allows for real-time monitoring of distinct UPR branches, thereby providing mechanistic insights into which specific pathways can be modulated to alleviate ER stress-related pathology.  \nHowever, weaknesses include the fact that in vitro cell culture systems may not fully recapitulate the complex tissue context of IBM, where additional factors such as inflammatory signaling and in vivo tissue architecture also play roles. Moreover, while reporter assays reliably quantify UPR activation, they do not directly measure downstream pathological events, such as protein aggregation or cell death, which are critical in IBM. Thus, while this assay is a valuable tool for primary screening and mechanistic studies, positive hits would require further validation in more complex models including animal studies and eventually clinical settings (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 8-11, preusse2022endoplasmicreticulum‐stressand pages 9-11).', 'index': '4'}","{'hypothesis': 'Autophagic flux imaging assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThe proposed autophagic flux imaging assay involves live‐cell imaging of GFP‐LC3 cleavage and puncta formation under both basal conditions and in the presence of bafilomycin A1, a lysosomal inhibitor. This assay directly measures the dynamics of autophagy by assessing autophagosome formation and clearance. The use of a fluorescent LC3 reporter enables visualization of autophagosome accumulation, where an increase in puncta upon bafilomycin A1 treatment indicates active flux. In the context of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), this assay would typically be applied to muscle-related cells such as myotubes—especially those derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to better recapitulate muscle-specific pathology—or patient-derived fibroblasts which have also demonstrated autophagic dysfunction. The assay quantitatively determines the rate at which autophagosomes are generated and degraded over time when challenged with proteostatic stress (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nImpaired autophagy plays a central role in the pathogenesis of IBM. Multiple independent studies have highlighted defects in autophagosome formation and accumulation of autophagy-related markers such as LC3B-II and p62 in both muscle tissue and patient-derived fibroblasts. Reduced autophagic activity leads to insufficient clearance of damaged proteins and organelles, propagating cellular stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately muscle degeneration (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2). The clinical landscape underscores that targeting autophagy modulation may have therapeutic benefits, as conventional immunosuppressive treatments have shown limited efficacy, and there is significant interest in drugs that restore proteostasis (Clinical Trial Search: autophagy OR lysosomal enhancement OR proteostasis OR autophagic flux AND myositis OR muscle myopathy). Therefore, assessing autophagic flux using GFP‐LC3 reporter assays directly relates to a core pathogenic mechanism in IBM. By quantitatively measuring dynamic changes in autophagic flux, researchers can determine if candidate drugs enhance the autophagy pathway and promote the removal of toxic aggregates, which is essential for halting or reversing muscle degeneration in IBM (margeta2020autophagydefectsin pages 17-19, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 66-67).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nThe GFP‐LC3 puncta assay, in combination with bafilomycin A1, has been widely used in autophagy research, including in the evaluation of muscle diseases and related myopathies. Prior studies in models of skeletal myopathy—including plectin-deficient muscle cells—have employed similar approaches to delineate autophagic flux and discern whether defective clearance is responsible for protein aggregate accumulation (zrelski2025impairedautophagicflux pages 13-16). Although direct examples from IBM models are less common, multiple reports using patient-derived fibroblasts and iPSC-derived myotubes have shown that autophagic dysfunction is a replicable feature of IBM pathology. Furthermore, such assays have facilitated the screening of autophagy inducers and lysosomal enhancers that could restore normal flux and potentially ameliorate muscle pathology (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, canto‐santos2023unravellinginclusionbody pages 1-2). The underlying principle has also been validated in studies of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy and other inflammatory myopathies, where similar approaches validated the association between altered autophagic dynamics and muscle degeneration (girolamo2019autophagymarkerslc3 pages 12-18).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths:  \n• The assay offers a dynamic and quantifiable assessment of autophagic flux by distinguishing between autophagosome synthesis and degradation.  \n• It provides multiparametric data that are crucial when screening drugs aimed at enhancing autophagy, which is a central pathological mechanism in IBM.  \n• Adaptation in iPSC-derived myotubes increases physiological relevance given the complex muscle-specific features of IBM, while usage in fibroblasts offers a cost-effective and patient-specific model (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 62-63, cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2).\n\nWeaknesses:  \n• Overexpression of fluorescent reporters like GFP‐LC3 can potentially introduce artifacts or alter basal autophagic activity.  \n• Cellular heterogeneity between fibroblasts and muscle cells may limit the direct translational relevance, necessitating careful model selection and validation.  \n• The indirect nature of flux inhibition by bafilomycin A1 may mask nuanced differences in selective versus general autophagic pathways, implying that complementary assays (e.g., assessing specific cargo clearance) might be necessary (margeta2020autophagydefectsin pages 17-19, zrelski2025impairedautophagicflux pages 13-16).\n\nIn summary, the GFP‐LC3 cleavage and puncta formation assay with bafilomycin A1 is a scientifically robust and translationally relevant approach for screening autophagy-modulating therapeutics in IBM. Its strengths in measuring dynamic autophagic flux align well with the pathophysiological features of IBM, although careful attention to model selection and assay optimization is required to overcome inherent limitations.', 'index': '7'}"

However, it focuses narrowly on one pathogenic axis (BACE‐mediated Aβ42 generation), neglecting immune‐mediated muscle damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and proteasome impairment—key drivers of disease. Variability in primary culture transfection and cytokine responsiveness further complicates reproducibility, and hits require downstream assays to assess broader phenotypes.

The assay quantifies BACE-mediated cleavage of APP using a fluorogenic substrate that yields a rapid fluorescent readout, directly reflecting the production of the toxic Aβ42 peptide. Human myotubes, representing the target muscle cell type, are employed to provide a biologically pertinent platform to test candidate drugs aimed at modulating this cleavage event (ahmed2012investigatingnoveltherapeutic pages 237-241).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nAmyloidogenic processing of APP via cleavage by BACE-1 is becoming recognized as a central mechanism contributing to sIBM pathology. Elevated levels of BACE-1 and abnormal APP processing correlate with intracellular accumulation of amyloid beta peptides and inclusion body formation in sIBM muscle fibers. Clinical and biochemical data have shown significant increases in amyloidogenic markers such as BACE-1, presenilin-1, and soluble APPβ in sIBM patients’ plasma, distinguishing the disease from other inflammatory myopathies. These findings strongly support the concept that an inflammatory microenvironment, as simulated by IFN-γ and IL-1β stimulation, can enhance the amyloidogenic pathway and directly contribute to muscle degeneration in sIBM (catalangarcia2015bace1ps1and pages 1-2, garcia2017mitochondrialprofileand pages 29-33).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nAssays measuring BACE activity have been employed in neurodegenerative research, particularly in Alzheimer’s disease, as well as in muscle cell culture models for sIBM.

In vitro drug screening efforts have evaluated compounds that reduce β-APP-induced toxicity, with successes demonstrated by decreased inclusion formation and improved proteasomal activity upon BACE inhibition. These precedents provide a solid foundation, indicating that a rapid fluorogenic assay for BACE activity under inflammatory conditions is amenable to early-stage drug discovery and validation in sIBM (ahmed2012investigatingnoveltherapeutic pages 225-230, catalangarcia2015bace1ps1and pages 7-7).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nA primary strength of this assay is its focus on a molecular event—BACE-mediated APP cleavage—that underpins a central aspect of sIBM pathogenesis, particularly in the context of inflammation-triggered amyloidogenic processing. The rapid, quantifiable fluorescent readout provides a sensitive tool for high-throughput screening of drug candidates. Additionally, using human myotubes enhances the assay’s physiological relevance, and stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokines further mirrors the complex pathological environment of sIBM.  \n\nHowever, the assay has limitations. sIBM is a multifactorial disease involving not only amyloidogenic mechanisms but also mitochondrial dysfunction, proteasome impairment, and immune-related processes. Relying solely on BACE activity as a readout may overlook effects of candidate drugs on other key pathogenic pathways. Moreover, variability in cytokine responses and transfection efficiency in primary muscle cultures can introduce experimental variability that must be carefully controlled (ahmed2012investigatingnoveltherapeutic pages 126-131, garcia2017mitochondrialprofileand pages 60-62). Ultimately, while the assay is robust for assessing the modulation of amyloidogenic APP processing, it is best integrated into a multi-assay platform that evaluates other degenerative and inflammatory markers to comprehensively address sIBM pathology (garcia2017mitochondrialprofileand pages 74-80).', 'index': '0'}","{'hypothesis': 'Immune co-culture apoptosis assay', 'answer': 'Assay Overview:  \nThis proposal centers on an immune co-culture apoptosis assay designed to recapitulate a central aspect of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) pathogenesis—namely, the direct cytotoxic interaction between autologous CD8+ T cells and muscle fibers. In this assay, primary human myotubes are co-cultured with patient-derived, antigen-exposed CD8+ T cells in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α. The addition of these cytokines mimics the IBM muscle microenvironment by upregulating MHC class I expression on myotubes, thereby increasing their susceptibility to immune-mediated attack. This set-up is intended to trigger cell death, which is quantified via high-content imaging through markers such as cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL positivity. The use of primary human cells allows the assay to capture the patient-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses reflective of the antigen-driven, oligoclonal expansion seen in IBM muscle tissue (benveniste2015amyloiddepositsand pages 4-6, benveniste2019inclusionbodymyositis pages 2-3).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe inflammatory and degenerative interplay in IBM is characterized by the infiltration of highly differentiated CD8+ T cells, which express cytotoxic molecules such as perforin, granzymes, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (britson2020thereandback pages 12-17, damian2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 3-5). This cellular component is central to IBM pathogenesis, as these T cells engage in direct cytotoxic interactions with muscle fibers that overexpress MHC class I under the influence of IFN-γ and TNF-α (bhattarai2017functionalroleof pages 19-24, guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 13-15). The assay’s focus on apoptosis detection (cleaved caspase-3 or TUNEL) aligns with observed immune-mediated muscle fiber injury, despite some debate whether the predominant mode of cell death is apoptotic or necroptotic (kamiya2023musclefibernecroptosis pages 2-3, mccord2023cytotoxicimmunecells pages 1-2). Importantly, clinical and pathological analyses highlight that the antigen recognition by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells drives muscle damage and may be a key trigger for downstream degenerative processes (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 27-28, nelke2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 1-2).

The proposed model uses cytokine-treated muscle cells to simulate the inflammatory environment observed in IBM, thereby inducing aberrant tau phosphorylation mediated by kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). By applying small-molecule modulators to these cell cultures, one can directly assess therapeutic intervention effects on tau hyperphosphorylation. The biological material for this assay includes established muscle cell models—such as C2C12 myoblasts—or potentially even alternative models where human tau is expressed in muscle (as supported by studies using C. elegans muscle models) (Clinical Trials Search: phosphorylated tau AND inclusion body myositis, NCT00917956; russell2021generationandcharacterization pages 5-7).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nPathologically, IBM is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and intracellular protein inclusions containing phosphorylated tau, similar to tauopathies in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.

In addition, inflammatory cytokines prevalent in IBM not only contribute to muscle damage but also exacerbate kinase activation, particularly GSK-3β and CDK5, which in turn drive tau phosphorylation. Consequently, monitoring tau phosphorylation levels is highly relevant for both understanding disease mechanisms and evaluating therapeutic efficacy.

In this assay, primary human myotubes are co-cultured with patient-derived, antigen-exposed CD8+ T cells in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α. The addition of these cytokines mimics the IBM muscle microenvironment by upregulating MHC class I expression on myotubes, thereby increasing their susceptibility to immune-mediated attack. This set-up is intended to trigger cell death, which is quantified via high-content imaging through markers such as cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL positivity. The use of primary human cells allows the assay to capture the patient-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses reflective of the antigen-driven, oligoclonal expansion seen in IBM muscle tissue (benveniste2015amyloiddepositsand pages 4-6, benveniste2019inclusionbodymyositis pages 2-3).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe inflammatory and degenerative interplay in IBM is characterized by the infiltration of highly differentiated CD8+ T cells, which express cytotoxic molecules such as perforin, granzymes, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (britson2020thereandback pages 12-17, damian2022inclusionbodymyositis pages 3-5).

Multiple studies have demonstrated that markers of ER stress, such as spliced XBP1 (sXBP1) and CHOP, are elevated in IBM as well as other related myopathies, suggesting that proteostasis imbalance is a driving force in disease progression (bohnert2018emergingrolesof pages 15-18, ruparelia2024atrogin1promotesmuscle pages 18-19).

This association is reinforced by genetic and immunohistochemical analyses showing that multiple branches of the UPR, including the IRE1-XBP1 pathway and the PERK-CHOP branch, contribute to the cellular response under stress conditions and regulate apoptotic as well as compensatory mechanisms in muscle, making the monitoring of these pathways highly relevant (krishna2023indicatorsofincreased pages 10-11).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nUPR reporter assays have been previously employed in various models of ER stress-linked pathologies.

Similarly, CHOP-GFP assays have been utilized to monitor the pro-apoptotic signaling downstream of PERK activation and have provided insights into how modulation of this branch can impact cell viability and stress-induced apoptotic pathways (harish2019pharmacologicalmodulationof pages 32-35). Although direct application to IBM is underexplored in the literature, the widespread use of these reporters in drug discovery for other protein aggregation diseases underscores their potential utility in IBM research.

Measurements include aggregate number, size, and subcellular distribution, providing multiparametric data on proteostasis integrity. The primary biological material comprises differentiated myoblast cultures, including patient-derived cells and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived myotubes that recapitulate key molecular features of IBM pathology (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 69-73).\n\nBiomedical Evidence:  \nThe central pathogenic mechanism in IBM involves the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates that disrupt proteostasis. Pathologically, IBM muscles exhibit abnormal deposits of amyloid-β, phospho-tau, and TDP-43, which are intimately linked to muscle degeneration and inflammatory processes (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 19-20, guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 23-24). Clinical studies and autopsy findings underscore that these aggregates not only serve as biomarkers but also contribute actively to disease progression (britson2020thereandback pages 12-17). The use of automated immunofluorescence provides an objective approach to quantifying these aggregates in vitro, ensuring that subtle changes in proteostasis can be detected. This becomes especially relevant given that the precise early detection of protein aggregation is critical for assessing candidate proteostasis modulators in a therapeutic context across similar neurodegenerative spectra (Clinical Trial Search: inclusion body myositis cell culture aggregation assay OR proteostasis imaging).\n\nPrevious Use:  \nAutomated immunofluorescence-based aggregate quantification has been successfully applied in neurodegenerative disease research where proteostasis impairment plays a pivotal role. Platforms analogous to AggreCount have been employed to discern alterations in aggregate burden upon administration of therapeutic agents, thereby validating potential drug candidates (britson2020thereandback pages 29-34, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 56-57). In the context of IBM, recent work has illustrated that patient-derived iPSC-myotubes accurately model protein aggregation phenomena, thus providing a preclinical assay relevant for therapeutic screening (cantosantos2025humaninducedpluripotent pages 1-2, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 53-56). Although direct usages of high-content imaging specifically targeting amyloid-β oligomers or phospho-tau in IBM remain emerging, the converging evidence from neurodegenerative models supports the feasibility and translational value of this approach (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 235-238).\n\nOverall Evaluation:  \nStrengths of the assay include its scalability and multiparametric nature, which allow for detailed, quantitative analysis of protein aggregate burden—a central hallmark of IBM pathology. Automated image segmentation minimizes user bias and increases reproducibility, critical for early-stage therapeutic screening. Furthermore, by using disease-relevant in vitro models such as patient-derived myoblasts or iPSC-derived myotubes, the assay closely mirrors the cellular pathogenesis observed in IBM patients (santos2023novelcellmodels pages 57-57, santos2023novelcellmodels pages 69-73).\n\nHowever, potential weaknesses exist. The in vitro culture conditions may not fully recapitulate the inflammatory environment present in vivo, which has been shown to modulate aggregate formation as observed in some studies (mccord2023investigatingtheinfluence pages 235-238). Moreover, protein aggregation is only one facet of IBM pathology—mitochondrial dysfunction and immune-mediated muscle injury also contribute significantly, and these may require complementary assays for a holistic evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. Thus, while the assay is highly promising for monitoring proteostasis and aggregate modulation, it may need to be integrated within a broader panel of functional and molecular endpoints to fully predict clinical outcomes in IBM (guglielmi2024sporadicinclusionbody pages 1-2, britson2020thereandback pages 12-17).', 'index': '9'}"
