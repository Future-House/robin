Rapamycin (Sirolimus),"Proposal for Rapamycin (Sirolimus)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rapamycin, also known as sirolimus, was originally isolated as a natural macrolide produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus and has since been developed as a key member of the mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitors—a class of compounds with potent immunosuppressive and anti‐proliferative properties (Perl, 2016). Its discovery stemmed from investigations into soil microorganisms, and its chemical structure features a macrocyclic lactone core which confers its unique ability to bind to the intracellular protein FKBP12, thereby forming a complex that targets mTORC1 specifically (Perl, 2016). Rapamycin belongs to the class of rapalogs or mTOR inhibitors, which have been extensively investigated both in experimental models and clinically, primarily for their immunomodulatory effects in transplantation medicine, and more recently as modulators of aging and various proteinopathies (Konopka et al., 2023). This compound was synthesized and optimized over decades since its initial discovery and later repurposed to act as a targeted inhibitor of mTORC1—a key regulator of protein synthesis, cellular metabolism, and autophagy—with its well-characterized safety profile in humans forming the backbone for its repurposing strategy in neuromuscular disorders such as Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) (Harinath et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Rapamycin has a long and storied therapeutic history; originally approved for use in transplant patients to prevent organ rejection due to its immunosuppressive effects (ClinicalTrials.gov). Over the years, rapamycin has also been employed in oncology and aging studies, and its pharmacokinetics have been characterized extensively in both animal models and human subjects (Evans et al., 2021). In several preclinical muscle disease models—including those resembling aspects of IBM pathology—rapamycin enhanced autophagic flux, reduced protein aggregate burden, and improved overall muscle function, suggesting its promise in conditions characterized by impaired autophagy and proteostasis (Lilleker et al., 2019; Reyngoudt et al., 2024). Although rapamycin has not been approved specifically for IBM, several clinical trials (for example, NCT02481453 and NCT04789070) are currently evaluating its efficacy and safety in IBM and related neuromuscular disorders, thereby providing a translational bridge from its known applications to this underserved therapeutic area (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022). Moreover, previous studies in muscle aging and sarcopenia models, as well as in neuromuscular conditions such as VCP-associated multisystem proteinopathy, have shown that rapamycin can modify disease progression, albeit with nuances regarding dosing and potential adverse effects (Joseph et al., 2019; Korb, Kimonis, & Mozaffar, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
Rapamycin’s mechanism of action is centered on its ability to form a complex with the immunophilin FKBP12, an interaction that enables the compound to allosterically inhibit the mTORC1 complex, thereby dampening its kinase activity (Perl, 2016). mTORC1 is a critical regulator of cellular protein synthesis; it phosphorylates substrates such as S6K1 and 4E-BP1 to promote translation initiation, while simultaneously suppressing autophagy by phosphorylating key autophagy-initiating proteins like ULK1 (Kaiser, 2019). In the context of IBM, mTORC1 hyperactivity is postulated to be a central driver of autophagic inhibition, leading to the accumulation of pathological protein aggregates including TDP-43 and β-amyloid, as well as inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Lin et al., 2022; Lilleker et al., 2019). By inhibiting mTORC1, rapamycin is expected to reinstate autophagic flux, thereby facilitating the clearance of these toxic aggregates and reducing ER stress, which in turn could improve sarcomere organization and contractile force in IBM patient-derived myotubes (Selvarani et al., 2021; Perl, 2016). This direct engagement with mTORC1 has been characterized in multiple studies involving preclinical myotube assays and animal models, where rapamycin treatment resulted in enhanced autophagy and improved muscle fiber morphology (Joseph et al., 2019; Konopka et al., 2023). The compound’s pharmacological action is both rapid and specific, with established oral formulations that allow for predictable dosing regimens, which is critical given that over-suppression of mTOR activity may lead to undesirable side effects such as impaired muscle protein synthesis (Konopka et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay using IBM patient-derived myotubes, rapamycin is expected to inhibit mTORC1 hyperactivity, thereby restoring autophagic flux that is otherwise impaired in these cells (Lilleker et al., 2019; Perl, 2016). Under normal conditions, mTORC1 hyperactivation in IBM contributes to the reduced clearance of misfolded proteins and toxic aggregates including TDP-43 and β-amyloid, which are key pathological features observed in the disease (Han et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022). The anticipated pharmacodynamic effect is the enhanced formation and turnover of autophagosomes, as evidenced by increased LC3-II levels and decreased p62 accumulation—biochemical markers that have been validated in both sarcopenia and proteinopathy models (Joseph et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2022). In addition, by reducing ER stress through autophagy enhancement, rapamycin is expected to mitigate the secondary pathogenic cascades that lead to muscle fiber degeneration and disrupted sarcomere architecture (Selvarani et al., 2021; Harinath et al., 2024). The reduction in aggregate burdens and the alleviation of ER stress should, in theory, translate into improved contractile force and better overall muscle cell function, which are critical endpoints in IBM (Lilleker et al., 2019; Reyngoudt et al., 2024). The expression of key autophagy-related genes in myotubes derived from IBM patients further supports the mechanistic rationale, since restoring autophagy has been shown to normalize proteostasis in similar models (Perl, 2016; Joseph et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, rapamycin exhibits strong promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis due to its well-documented ability to inhibit mTORC1, thereby restoring autophagic flux and reducing the accumulation of deleterious protein aggregates that are central to IBM pathogenesis (Konopka et al., 2023; Lilleker et al., 2019). One significant strength of rapamycin lies in its extensive clinical history and established safety profile in various patient populations, particularly in solid organ transplantation and oncology, which provides a robust foundation for its repurposing in IBM (Evans et al., 2021; Harinath et al., 2024). The fact that rapamycin is available in oral formulations with well-understood dosing regimens further supports its feasibility for long-term use in IBM patients, whose treatment options are currently limited (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov). Additionally, preclinical evidence from muscle disease models and myotube assays has consistently shown that mTORC1 inhibition can ameliorate features of muscle degeneration by enhancing autophagy, thereby supporting the hypothesis that rapamycin might clear TDP-43 and β-amyloid aggregates while reducing ER stress (Joseph et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2022).

Nonetheless, there are several challenges and potential weaknesses associated with repurposing rapamycin for IBM. While mTORC1 inhibition is critical for enhancing autophagy, excessive or prolonged inhibition may also suppress muscle protein synthesis and negatively impact muscle repair and regeneration, thereby necessitating a delicate balance in dosing (Konopka et al., 2023; Perl, 2016). Moreover, although rapamycin has been widely studied in transplant and aging settings, direct clinical data in IBM is still emerging, and the precise effects on sarcomere organization and contractile force in IBM patient-derived myotubes require further experimental validation (Lilleker et al., 2019; Reyngoudt et al., 2024). There have also been reports that autophagy modulation can have context-dependent outcomes—some preclinical models have even suggested that rapamycin-induced autophagy might aggravate muscle pathology under certain conditions, underscoring the need for careful patient selection and dosing strategies (Korb, Kimonis, & Mozaffar, 2021; Schmidt et al., 2017). Furthermore, the immunosuppressive effects of rapamycin, although generally manageable, may pose risks in IBM patients who are often older and may have comorbidities that complicate long-term treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017; Perl, 2016).

In summary, rapamycin’s well-established mechanism of mTORC1 inhibition combined with its capacity to restore autophagy provides a compelling rationale for repurposing it as a therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis. The extensive preclinical data supporting its effects on protein aggregate clearance, coupled with its known pharmacokinetic and safety profiles from other clinical settings, are major strengths that support further investigation. However, optimizing dosing to avoid potential adverse effects on muscle protein synthesis and regeneration is critical, and additional preclinical studies in IBM-specific models as well as well-designed clinical trials are needed to fully validate its efficacy and safety in this indication (Lin et al., 2022; Konopka et al., 2023; Stanfield et al., 2024). Given the significant unmet medical need in IBM and the promising mechanistic data, rapamycin represents a high-priority candidate for further development and clinical evaluation, albeit with a cautious approach to mitigating its immunosuppressive and potential myotoxic side effects (Selvarani et al., 2021; Joseph et al., 2019).

Overall, our evaluation concludes that rapamycin is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis. Its origins as a natural macrolide, well-characterized pharmacological history in other indications, clear molecular mechanism involving direct inhibition of mTORC1 via FKBP12 binding, and its documented ability to restore autophagic flux and clear misfolded protein aggregates collectively offer strong potential for addressing the proteostasis defects observed in IBM (Perl, 2016; Lilleker et al., 2019; Joseph et al., 2019). While challenges remain regarding dosing optimization, long-term safety, and balancing its dual roles in protein synthesis and degradation, the preclinical and emerging clinical evidence supports moving forward with targeted IBM studies, including patient-derived myotube assays and controlled clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022; Konopka et al., 2023). This comprehensive review validates the hypothesis that mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin may indeed restore autophagy, clear toxic protein aggregates, alleviate ER stress, and ultimately improve muscle contractility and organization in Inclusion Body Myositis, warranting its further development as a repurposed therapeutic candidate in this challenging neuromuscular disease (Lilleker et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2022; Han et al., 2022).

Arimoclomol,"Proposal for Arimoclomol

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Arimoclomol is an orally administrable small molecule developed originally as a pharmacological co‐inducer of the heat shock response. It belongs to a chemical class of hydroxylamine derivatives engineered to selectively amplify cellular stress responses via upregulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps), particularly Hsp70. Originally discovered through efforts to harness the cell’s intrinsic chaperone systems for neurodegenerative proteinopathies, arimoclomol was synthesized to enhance the natural expression of Hsps only under conditions of cellular stress; in healthy cells with low baseline Hsp activation, the drug generally produces minimal induction, thereby reducing the potential for off‐target toxicity (Kirkegaard et al., 2016; Parfitt et al., 2014). The compound’s synthesis and discovery represent a rational design strategy aimed at safely boosting proteostasis mechanisms, and its chemical properties allow for oral bioavailability and favorable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles that have been demonstrated in both preclinical and early clinical studies (Bonne, 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, arimoclomol has been evaluated extensively in neurodegenerative diseases, most notably in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where its mechanism of enhancing Hsp70 expression has shown promise in preclinical models by reducing misfolded protein aggregates and prolonging motor neuron survival (Benatar et al., 2018; Benatar et al., 2024). Several clinical trials investigating arimoclomol’s effect in ALS have established a favorable safety profile and provided preliminary evidence of target engagement, although definitive clinical efficacy has proven elusive (Benatar et al., 2024). Importantly for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), the drug has also been explored in preclinical models of IBM—both in xenograft systems and in primary myoblast cultures—where upregulation of Hsps was associated with a reduction in pathological protein aggregates such as TDP-43 and p62, as well as improvements in mitochondrial function and muscle contractility (Ahmed et al., 2016; Snedden et al., 2021). Clinical trials specifically targeting IBM have been registered (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008, 2017), and although these studies have primarily focused on safety and tolerability, trends observed in functional measures and biomarker endpoints suggest potential benefits in this patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of arimoclomol is well characterized at the molecular level. Under conditions of cellular stress, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) dissociates from its inhibitory complex and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to heat shock elements (HSEs) in the promoter regions of heat shock genes. Arimoclomol binds to a co-activator site on HSF1, thereby prolonging its activation and enhancing the transcription of inducible heat shock proteins such as Hsp70 (Ahmed et al., 2016; Kirkegaard et al., 2016). This amplification of the heat shock response enables cells to increase their chaperone capacity, which in turn facilitates the proper folding of nascent or misfolded proteins and promotes the clearance of toxic aggregates through mechanisms such as chaperone-assisted selective autophagy. In the context of Inclusion Body Myositis, where the pathological hallmarks include intracellular aggregates of TDP-43 and p62, the induced Hsp70 molecules can directly interact with these misfolded proteins, reducing their accumulation and alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (Ahmed et al., 2016; Snedden et al., 2021). Moreover, preclinical studies in mutant VCP mouse models—models that recapitulate aspects of IBM pathology—demonstrated that treatment with arimoclomol led to a reduction in ubiquitin-positive aggregates, improved mitochondrial morphology, and enhanced muscle force, indicating that the drug’s mechanism supports both protein quality control and organelle integrity (Ahmed et al., 2016; Kirkegaard et al., 2016).

Expected Effect:
The core hypothesis for the use of arimoclomol in IBM is that co-induction of heat shock proteins—particularly Hsp70—will enhance chaperone-assisted selective autophagy in IBM myotubes, leading to a reduction in the levels of toxic protein aggregates such as p62 and TDP-43. This enhancement of proteostasis is expected to restore healthy mitochondrial function in muscle cells and ultimately result in increased contractile amplitude, thereby improving muscle strength and functional performance in IBM patients (Ahmed et al., 2016; Snedden et al., 2021). There is supportive evidence that in primary rat myoblast models overexpressing pathological proteins, arimoclomol treatment significantly reduced inclusion body formation and restored normal cellular calcium homeostasis, both of which are critical for effective muscle contraction (Ahmed et al., 2016). Additionally, improvements in mitochondrial function and muscle force generation have been observed in preclinical models treated with arimoclomol, further supporting the expectation that similar benefits may be seen in IBM myotubes where mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired contractile amplitude are prominent (Snedden et al., 2021; Kirkegaard et al., 2016). Expression studies have confirmed that key molecular targets such as HSP70 and its regulatory pathways are active in IBM muscle fibers, thereby providing a biological basis for the use of arimoclomol in this context (Ahmed et al., 2016; Bonne, 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
Arimoclomol represents a promising therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis due to its unique mechanism of selectively enhancing the heat shock response—a strategy that directly addresses the pathophysiological hallmarks of IBM, namely perturbed proteostasis, toxic protein aggregate accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and muscle weakness. One of the primary strengths of arimoclomol is its demonstrated ability to upregulate Hsp70 expression in a stress-dependent manner, thereby avoiding non-specific induction in healthy cells and reducing the risk of adverse effects (Kirkegaard et al., 2016; Parfitt et al., 2014). Its oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile, as established in multiple Phase II and III trials in ALS and preliminary studies in IBM, enhance its translational potential (Benatar et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Furthermore, preclinical evidence supports the hypothesis that arimoclomol’s HSP co-induction can lead to reduced aggregates of proteins such as TDP-43 and p62—aggregates that are directly implicated in the muscle pathology of IBM—and can improve mitochondrial function and contractile properties in muscle cells (Ahmed et al., 2016; Snedden et al., 2021). The pharmacodynamic properties of arimoclomol have been characterized in both in vitro and in vivo models, and its ability to cross biological barriers, including the blood-brain barrier, underscores its potential utility beyond central nervous system disorders, extending into muscle pathologies like IBM (Benatar et al., 2018; Kirkegaard et al., 2016).

On the other hand, there are some weaknesses that must be addressed in further development. Clinical trials in ALS have shown that while arimoclomol is safe and well tolerated, the demonstrated clinical benefit has been modest or inconclusive, raising questions about dose optimization and the translation of molecular effects into meaningful functional improvements (Benatar et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2022). Additionally, trials in IBM have so far yielded trends toward slowing disease progression rather than clear-cut improvements, which may be due to the inherent heterogeneity of IBM, the slow progressive nature of the disease, or the need for longer treatment durations and more sensitive outcome measures (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017). Variability in biomarkers—for example, in HSP70 levels measured in muscle biopsies—suggests that patient stratification and robust pharmacodynamic measurement strategies will be critical in future studies (Ahmed et al., 2016; Santos et al., 2025).

Moreover, although the mechanistic rationale is compelling, the direct effects of arimoclomol on muscle contractile amplitude have primarily been shown in preclinical models, and further clinical studies with comprehensive biomarker panels and functional imaging (such as quantitative muscle MRI) are required to conclusively establish its efficacy in improving muscle strength in IBM patients (Salam et al., 2025; Snedden et al., 2021).

Overall, the strengths of arimoclomol for treating Inclusion Body Myositis include its targeted mechanism of action through selective Hsp co-induction, favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, and encouraging preclinical data demonstrating its potential to ameliorate key features of IBM such as pathological protein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction. The major limitations lie in the translation of these molecular effects into robust clinical efficacy, the need for more refined biomarkers to assess treatment response, and the heterogeneity inherent in IBM pathology that may require combination therapy or personalized approaches. Nonetheless, given the mechanistic rationale and the unmet medical need in IBM, arimoclomol remains a strong candidate for further clinical exploration, ideally in well-designed, adequately powered trials that incorporate sensitive measures of muscle function and proteostasis biomarkers (Ahmed et al., 2016; Snedden et al., 2021; Benatar et al., 2024).

Ruxolitinib,"Proposal for Ruxolitinib

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Ruxolitinib (marketed as Jakafi®) is a small‐molecule synthetic inhibitor originally designed and synthesized through rational drug design approaches aimed at targeting Janus kinase enzymes, specifically JAK1 and JAK2. It belongs to the class of JAK inhibitors, a well‐defined group of compounds that modulate the intracellular signaling cascades initiated by various cytokines, including interferons. Ruxolitinib is manufactured using a fully synthetic chemical process and has been optimized for oral bioavailability, robust pharmacokinetic properties, and selective inhibition of JAK1/2 catalytic activity. This compound was discovered during the development of agents to treat myeloproliferative neoplasms, where dysregulation of cytokine signaling is central to disease pathology. Over subsequent years, drugs in this class have been broadly applied in not only hematologic malignancies (such as myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera) but also in autoimmune disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus and inflammatory myopathies. Its potential to modulate pro‐inflammatory cytokine profiles, particularly those driven by interferon alpha (IFNα) and interferon gamma (IFNγ), makes ruxolitinib a promising candidate for repurposing in Inclusion Body Myositis (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2025; Hou et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Ruxolitinib has a well‐established therapeutic history in the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms, where it is used to mitigate symptoms and reduce splenomegaly owing to overactive cytokine signaling. Its use extends to several autoimmune and inflammatory conditions; for instance, preclinical studies and early-phase clinical investigations have demonstrated efficacy in conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus, where IFN-driven pathology plays a dominant role. Although IBM is traditionally considered refractory to conventional immunosuppressive therapies, emerging evidence suggests that interferon-driven mechanisms are active within IBM muscle tissue, as indicated by elevated MHC I expression and pro-inflammatory gene signatures. Clinical trial designs such as Ruxolitinib Treatment in Inclusion Body Myositis are currently investigating ruxolitinib in the context of IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2025; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Damian et al., 2022). Moreover, case reports in juvenile dermatomyositis and studies of JAK inhibitors in dermatomyositis suggest that the underlying pathological pathways modulated by interferon signaling are likely shared among inflammatory myopathies, making ruxolitinib a viable therapeutic candidate even though it has not yet been widely applied in IBM specifically (Aeschlimann et al., 2018; Ladislau et al., 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
Ruxolitinib functions through competitive inhibition of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of JAK1 and JAK2, thereby effectively blocking the phosphorylation events required for STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) protein activation. Under normal circumstances, cytokines such as IFNα and IFNγ bind to their respective receptors, triggering receptor-associated activation of JAK kinases. Activated JAKs then phosphorylate intracellular tyrosine residues on the receptor, creating docking sites for STAT proteins that become phosphorylated, dimerize, and translocate to the nucleus to initiate transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). In the context of IBM, the chronic elevation of interferon signals (both IFNα and IFNγ) drives upregulation of MHC I and other pro-inflammatory mediators in muscle fibers, leading to subsequent muscle damage, proteasome-mediated degradation of contractile proteins, and impaired myogenesis. By inhibiting JAK1/2, ruxolitinib is expected to suppress STAT phosphorylation (notably STAT1 and STAT3), thereby attenuating the transcriptional program responsible for these deleterious effects (Huang et al., 2020; Kim, 2021). Further, evidence from in vitro models of IFNγ-induced muscle atrophy demonstrates that pharmacological blockade of the JAK/STAT pathway can reverse atrophy markers and restore normal myogenic differentiation, which directly addresses the proteasome-mediated degradation and contractile dysfunction observed in IBM (Chen et al., 2021; Hou et al., 2021). Additionally, ruxolitinib’s suppression of JAK-mediated pathways may reduce the expression of E3 ubiquitin ligases—such as atrogin-1 (FBXO32) and MuRF-1 (TRIM63)—thereby inhibiting the proteasome system that contributes to the degradation of muscle proteins (Huang et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay, the hypothesis is that ruxolitinib-mediated JAK1/2 blockade will attenuate the upregulation of interferon-driven, pro-inflammatory gene expression in IBM myotubes, thereby reducing the expression of MHC I as well as cytokine-induced markers of atrophy. This is expected to translate into a decrease in the proteasome-mediated degradation of muscle structural proteins, leading to a restoration or improvement of contractile amplitude in muscle fibers. In vitro studies in related contexts have provided evidence that JAK inhibitors can reverse IFN-induced atrophy markers and improve myotube formation as well as contractile function (Shrager et al., 2024; Hou et al., 2021). Given that IBM muscle fibers exhibit a prominent IFN signature and upregulated proteasomal activity contributing to contractile dysfunction, the inhibition of JAK1/2 by ruxolitinib is predicted to normalize these aberrant cellular processes. Moreover, transcriptomic and biochemical studies indicate that pathological activation of the JAK/STAT pathway in muscle not only contributes to inflammatory gene expression but also exacerbates proteasome activity and oxidative damage to contractile machinery, which altogether diminish contractile force. Thus, the expected effect is dual: (1) a reduction of pro-inflammatory gene expression leading to improved muscle repair and regeneration, and (2) a decrease in proteasome-mediated degradation of contractile proteins, which will restore normal muscle function (Hou et al., 2021; Shrager et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2020). Additionally, studies in models of inflammatory myopathies have shown that JAK inhibition is associated with increased myotube cross-sectional area and improved electrical stimulation responses, indicating potential benefits for restoring muscle contractility (Ladislau et al., 2018).

Overall Evaluation:
Ruxolitinib presents a compelling therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on its well-characterized pharmacokinetics and established safety profile from its approved uses in myeloproliferative disorders, as well as its documented ability to modulate key inflammatory pathways implicated in autoimmune muscle diseases. One major strength of ruxolitinib is its mechanism-based approach; by selectively targeting JAK1/2, it disrupts the overactive interferon signaling that is central to IBM pathology. This mechanism of action not only has the potential to reduce the expression of inflammatory mediators and MHC I in muscle fibers but also to inhibit proteasome-mediated degradation pathways that contribute to the degeneration of contractile proteins. The preclinical data in related inflammatory myopathies and in vitro assays using human muscle cells support the notion that JAK inhibition can restore muscle integrity and function (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2025; Hou et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021). Additionally, the repurposing advantage is significant: as an already marketed drug, ruxolitinib has a well-understood dosing regimen and safety profile in adults, and its pharmacologic properties can facilitate rapid clinical translation for a new indication such as IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Damian et al., 2022).

However, several weaknesses or concerns must be addressed. Despite the mechanistic plausibility, direct clinical evidence for the efficacy of ruxolitinib in IBM remains limited; most evidence is extrapolated from studies in dermatomyositis or other interferon-driven conditions (Aeschlimann et al., 2018; Ladislau et al., 2018). IBM is a complex disorder that includes not only inflammatory but also degenerative, proteotoxic, and possibly mitochondrial components, and it is uncertain whether a single cytokine-targeting approach will be sufficient to reverse muscle weakness in this heterogeneous condition. Furthermore, potential side effects associated with JAK inhibitors, such as immunosuppression and increased infection risk, must be closely monitored in elderly IBM patients who may already have compromised health status (Moghadam-Kia & Oddis, 2022). There is also the concern that long-term inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway could interfere with normal muscle repair processes, particularly because STAT signaling has not only pathogenic but also physiological roles in muscle regeneration (Kim, 2021). From a developmental feasibility standpoint, although repurposing a marketed drug represents a substantial advantage in terms of cost and regulatory pathway, rigorous clinical trials specifically designed for IBM will be required to delineate the appropriate dosing regimen, efficacy endpoints, and long-term safety profile in this patient population (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2025; Damian et al., 2022).

In summary, ruxolitinib’s capacity to attenuate IFNα and IFNγ-induced inflammatory signaling by blocking JAK1/2 is strongly supported by mechanistic studies and early clinical experiences in other inflammatory myopathies, providing a solid rationale for its repurposing in IBM. The candidate’s strengths lie in its targeted mechanism of action, established clinical use, and promising preclinical data that predict a reduction in proteasomal activity and restoration of muscle contractile function. Nonetheless, the limited direct evidence in IBM, potential adverse effects, and the multifactorial nature of IBM pathology represent challenges that will need to be addressed in subsequent clinical trials. Overall, considering its mechanistic specificity and favorable treatment history in related conditions, ruxolitinib is a promising candidate that warrants further investigation in preclinical IBM models and well-designed clinical studies to validate its efficacy and safety in this difficult-to-treat myopathy (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2025; Hou et al., 2021; Ladislau et al., 2018; Shrager et al., 2024; Moghadam-Kia & Oddis, 2022; Paik et al., 2022).

Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid (TUDCA),"Proposal for Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid (TUDCA)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid (TUDCA) is a naturally occurring bile acid derivative originally found as a taurine‐conjugated form of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Historically, TUDCA was discovered in traditional Chinese medicine and later developed for its hepatoprotective properties. It belongs to the class of chemical chaperones—compounds that assist in the proper folding of proteins and alleviate stress within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). TUDCA’s favorable attributes include low toxicity, oral bioavailability, and the ability to modulate multiple cell signaling pathways. It is FDA approved for treating certain cholestatic liver diseases, and its use as a chemical chaperone has been explored in a wide range of disease models characterized by ER stress and protein misfolding (Kusaczuk, 2019).

Therapeutic History:
TUDCA has a long history of application in both clinical and preclinical settings. Clinically, it has been used to treat primary biliary cholangitis and other hepatobiliary disorders due to its cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic properties. In the realm of protein misfolding and ER stress, TUDCA has shown promise in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as in metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes. Preclinical studies have demonstrated its ability to reduce ER stress markers—including binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and active forms of ATF6—in various animal models; notably, in muscle-specific disease models such as those with OPA1 deletion and lipin-1 deficiency, which share pathological features with Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) (Zito, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although there is no direct clinical trial data specifically for IBM, multiple clinical investigations have been conducted with TUDCA in related protein aggregation disorders such as transthyretin amyloidosis and ALS (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019). These studies support the concept that TUDCA’s modulation of ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) can translate into improved cellular function, providing a rationale for its repurposing in IBM and similar myopathies (Kusaczuk, 2019; Kny & Fielitz, 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, TUDCA functions primarily as a chemical chaperone that stabilizes the ER environment by promoting proper protein folding, thereby reducing the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Its mechanism involves a multifaceted modulation of the UPR. Specifically, TUDCA reduces the activation of ER stress sensors—IRE1, PERK, and ATF6—and downregulates the expression of pro-apoptotic transcription factors such as CHOP. This leads to decreased CHOP-mediated apoptosis and a restoration of proteostasis. In various animal models of myopathy and metabolic disease, TUDCA has been shown to attenuate ER stress markers (e.g., BIP, ATF6, CHOP) and reduce mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by decreased cytochrome c release and improved mitochondrial membrane integrity (Kusaczuk, 2019; Zito, 2019). Moreover, TUDCA can interact with several cell surface and nuclear receptors—including TGR5, FXR, and the glucocorticoid receptor—which may further contribute to its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects through the activation of downstream signaling pathways such as NFκB, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt (Kusaczuk, 2019; Duarte-Silva et al., 2024). This combination of direct chemical chaperoning with receptor-mediated modulation of intracellular signaling underpins TUDCA’s potential to stabilize protein folding environments and reduce cellular damage from chronic ER stress. Although much of the detailed mechanistic work has been performed in hepatocytes, neurodegenerative models, or cardiac tissues, the core cellular pathways targeted by TUDCA are also central to the pathology of IBM, where aberrant protein aggregation and persistent ER stress lead to muscle fiber degeneration (Zito, 2019; Kusaczuk, 2019).

Expected Effect:
In the context of Inclusion Body Myositis, the hypothesis is that TUDCA will alleviate the unfolded protein response activation that is a hallmark of the disease. IBM muscle pathology is marked by chronic ER stress, which drives an increased expression of markers such as BIP and CHOP. CHOP-mediated apoptosis, in particular, contributes to muscle cell loss and diminished contractile strength. By stabilizing ER membrane fluidity and aiding correct protein folding, TUDCA is expected to reduce the levels of misfolded proteins, thereby decreasing the activation of CHOP and other pro-apoptotic factors. Preclinical studies in muscle-specific models, such as those with mitochondrial defects or lipin-1 deficiency, have shown that TUDCA treatment results in improved muscle strength and reduced markers of ER stress (Zito, 2019; Kny & Fielitz, 2022). In vitro, assays performed on IBM myotubes would be expected to reveal reductions in ER stress indicators, a downregulation of CHOP, and improved proteostasis. This should translate into an improvement in contractile function of the myotubes, as the cellular environment becomes more conducive to proper protein synthesis and assembly. Given that TUDCA has already demonstrated efficacy in reducing ER stress in other cell types, including neuronal and muscle cells in diabetic and mitochondrial dysfunction models, it is reasonable to anticipate a similar protective and restorative effect in IBM muscle cells (Kusaczuk, 2019; Zito, 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
TUDCA emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on a robust mechanistic rationale and a favorable safety profile. Its natural derivation as a bile acid conjugate, well-documented history in hepatobiliary and neurodegenerative conditions, and established clinical safety in approved indications all contribute to its attractiveness for repurposing in IBM (Kusaczuk, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Strengths of TUDCA include its multifaceted mechanism of action—reducing ER stress by enhancing protein folding, downregulating the UPR and CHOP-mediated apoptosis, and modulating key signaling pathways (Zito, 2019; Duarte-Silva et al., 2024). These effects directly address pivotal aspects of IBM pathology, namely disrupted proteostasis and muscle degeneration driven by chronic ER stress. Additionally, TUDCA’s oral bioavailability and established clinical use in other indications significantly lower the barrier for clinical translation. On the other side, a notable weakness is the relative lack of direct preclinical and clinical data specifically in IBM or skeletal muscle protein aggregation disorders; current evidence is largely extrapolated from studies in neurological, hepatic, or cardiac contexts (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kusaczuk, 2019). Furthermore, while the biochemical pathways modulated by TUDCA are well established, the complexity of IBM pathogenesis means that other pathogenic mechanisms—such as inflammatory processes and autophagic dysfunction—may also need to be addressed in tandem. Overall, TUDCA’s potential to relieve ER stress and improve proteostasis in IBM remains a compelling hypothesis, but further targeted studies, including controlled preclinical experiments in IBM models and subsequent clinical trials, will be necessary to fully validate its efficacy in this challenging myopathy (Zito, 2019; Kny & Fielitz, 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In summary, TUDCA is a well-tolerated, repurposed drug with a documented ability to mitigate ER stress through chemical chaperone action, making it a promising candidate for addressing the proteostasis disruption observed in Inclusion Body Myositis. Its extensive preclinical data in reducing key ER stress markers and improving cellular survival, coupled with an established safety record, provide strong support for its further investigation as a therapeutic agent in IBM. Further detailed studies are warranted to determine the optimal dosing regimen, delivery method, and potential combination therapies that might maximize its clinical benefit in patients with IBM.

Reldesemtiv (CK-2127107),"Proposal for Reldesemtiv (CK-2127107)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Reldesemtiv (CK-2127107) is a synthetic small-molecule fast skeletal troponin activator that was discovered and optimized through contemporary high-throughput screening and medicinal chemistry efforts by Cytokinetics in collaboration with Astellas Pharma (Alsulami & Marston, 2020). It belongs to a novel class of compounds that modulate the contractile machinery of skeletal muscle by selectively binding to the troponin complex in fast skeletal fibers. Unlike traditional drugs that target neural transmission or systemic anabolic pathways, fast skeletal troponin activators such as reldesemtiv directly enhance the sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to calcium ions, thereby increasing force production in muscle fibers even under conditions of suboptimal stimulation (Andrews et al., 2018). This chemical class comprises molecules designed to work at the level of the sarcomere—the fundamental contractile unit of striated muscle—and has been leveraged previously for neuromuscular disorders where muscle weakness is a predominant clinical feature, demonstrating the potential to restore or amplify muscle function in various disease settings (Calder et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
The fast skeletal troponin activator class has a well-developed therapeutic history, with compounds such as tirasemtiv—the first generation member—being extensively evaluated in neuromuscular diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myasthenia gravis, and models of heart failure; these studies have provided critical insight into the feasibility of modulating muscle contractility via troponin activation (Hansen et al., 2014; Alsulami & Marston, 2020). Reldesemtiv itself is regarded as a next-generation candidate with improvements over earlier drugs; it has progressed through phase 1 clinical studies in healthy volunteers, demonstrating dose-dependent increases in muscle force production, and has been explored in phase 2 clinical studies in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients (Rudnicki et al., 2021; Andrews et al., 2018). Although no clinical trials have yet been reported specifically in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), the extensive evaluation of reldesemtiv and related compounds in other neuromuscular diseases underpins the notion that enhancing contractility on a molecular level could provide symptomatic benefits in a wide variety of muscle weakness disorders, including IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Alsulami & Marston, 2020). Preclinical rodent studies have shown that fast skeletal troponin activators improve exercise tolerance and delay fatigue in disease models that exhibit muscle atrophy and dysfunction (Hwee et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2019), which supports their potential repurposing for IBM—a condition characterized by progressive muscle weakness and contractile impairment (McCord, 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
On a molecular level, reldesemtiv functions by binding to the fast skeletal troponin complex with high specificity, thereby increasing its sensitivity to Ca²⁺ ions (Calder et al., 2016; Hwang & Sykes, 2015). The troponin complex in fast skeletal muscle comprises three subunits: troponin C (TnC), troponin I (TnI), and troponin T (TnT). Reldesemtiv interacts predominantly with troponin C, slowing the dissociation rate of Ca²⁺ from the low-affinity sites, which effectively prolongs the duration that the troponin complex remains in its calcium-bound, activatable conformation (Issahaku et al., 2023). This results in a leftward shift in the force–calcium (force–pCa) relationship in isolated fast skeletal muscle fibers, meaning that at any given submaximal Ca²⁺ concentration, a greater contractile force is generated (Andrews et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2019). Detailed molecular dynamics simulations have revealed that reldesemtiv binds with a free energy of approximately −41.30 kcal/mol to a specific pocket in the troponin C subunit, with key interacting residues in the neighboring regions of troponin I contributing to binding stabilization through van der Waals and electrostatic interactions (Issahaku et al., 2023). Importantly, reldesemtiv demonstrates high selectivity for fast skeletal muscle troponin over the isoforms expressed in slow-twitch and cardiac muscle, which minimizes the risk of off-target cardiac effects—a significant consideration in the development of muscle activators (Hwang & Sykes, 2015; Andrews et al., 2018). At the functional level, reldesemtiv increases the amplitude of muscle contractions by enhancing the formation of actin-myosin cross-bridges and increasing the time spent in the force-producing state during a contraction cycle, a process that translates to greater muscle strength and improved endurance, especially under conditions of fatigue (Hwee et al., 2015; Rudnicki et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
The working hypothesis for reldesemtiv in the context of IBM is that selective activation of fast skeletal troponin will increase calcium sensitivity in IBM myotubes, thereby compensating for intrinsic contractile deficits despite the underlying proteostasis defects characteristic of IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In vitro assays with IBM patient-derived myotubes are expected to show that, upon treatment with reldesemtiv, submaximal electrical stimulation leads to a significant increase in force generation compared to untreated controls (Andrews et al., 2018; Rudnicki et al., 2021). Given that IBM involves progressive inflammation, protein aggregation, and muscle fiber degeneration, the symptomatic deficit primarily lies in reduced contractile performance; enhancing the contractility even in a background of proteostasis imbalance could lead to measurable improvements in muscle strength and endurance. Preclinical rodent studies in other disease models have demonstrated that reldesemtiv enhances exercise tolerance by increasing muscle force output and reducing fatigability under repetitive stimulation conditions (Hwee et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2019). In addition, because the fast skeletal troponin complex is expressed in the affected muscle fibers of IBM patients (McCord, 2023), reldesemtiv’s mechanism of directly modulating this complex should be operational in IBM myotubes. Furthermore, the oral bioavailability and favorable pharmacokinetic profile of reldesemtiv, confirmed in healthy volunteers and SMA patients, suggests that therapeutically effective plasma concentrations can be achieved without incurring significant toxicity or adverse effects (Rudnicki et al., 2021; Andrews et al., 2018). Overall, the expected effect in an IBM setting is a direct improvement in muscle contractility, leading to enhanced functional outcomes—such as improved grip strength, walking distance, and reduced fatigue—that may translate into a better quality of life for patients, even if the underlying inflammatory pathology of IBM continues to progress (Alsulami & Marston, 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, the comprehensive literature review indicates that reldesemtiv shows considerable promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for the treatment of IBM based on its well-characterized mechanism of action, robust safety and pharmacokinetic profile, and demonstrated efficacy in augmenting skeletal muscle contractility in other neuromuscular disease contexts. One of the main strengths of reldesemtiv is its selective modulation of the fast skeletal troponin complex, which has been shown to enhance calcium sensitivity and prolong actin-myosin cross-bridge formation, thereby directly amplifying muscle contraction without impacting cardiac muscle (Calder et al., 2016; Hwang & Sykes, 2015). This mechanistic approach is highly relevant for IBM, where muscle weakness is a prominent clinical feature and the contractile machinery, although compromised by proteostasis defects, may still respond to enhancements in calcium sensitivity (McCord, 2023). Additionally, reldesemtiv’s oral formulation and its advancement into advanced clinical trials in diseases such as ALS and SMA underscore its developmental feasibility and potential to achieve regulatory approval in the near future (Rudnicki et al., 2021; Andrews et al., 2018).

However, there are also clear weaknesses and limitations. A significant concern is the lack of direct preclinical or clinical data demonstrating efficacy specifically in IBM. Although preclinical studies in rodent models of heart failure and other neuromuscular conditions have been promising (Hwee et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2019), IBM has unique pathological features such as chronic inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and protein misfolding, which may not be fully addressed by simply enhancing contractility (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ochala & Sun, 2016). Moreover, while reldesemtiv has proved safe in healthy individuals and in patients with other neuromuscular disorders, the altered muscle environment in IBM could potentially modify its efficacy or safety profile; for instance, prolonged calcium binding might affect muscle relaxation kinetics adversely in a diseased muscle milieu (Hwang & Sykes, 2015). Furthermore, IBM is characterized by multifactorial pathology involving inflammation, degeneration, and immune-mediated mechanisms, so a therapeutic that acts solely on contractile enhancement may only provide symptomatic relief rather than halting disease progression (Alsulami & Marston, 2020).

From a biochemical standpoint, the detailed molecular dynamics and binding studies (Issahaku et al., 2023) confirm that reldesemtiv engages its target with high affinity and selectivity, which bodes well for its mechanistic effectiveness in enhancing muscle contractility. However, this same specificity necessitates critical evaluation in the context of IBM, where the extent of muscle fiber damage and proteostatic stress might limit the potential for functional recovery even if contractility is transiently enhanced (Andrews et al., 2018). It is also essential to consider that any improvement in contractility may need to be sustained over long periods, and the chronic use of such activators in a slowly progressive disease like IBM requires careful long-term safety studies.

In conclusion, reldesemtiv represents a highly promising candidate to address a significant unmet medical need in IBM by directly enhancing skeletal muscle contractility—a strategy that bypasses upstream pathologic processes to provide symptomatic relief. The strengths of this candidate include its advanced clinical development stage in related neuromuscular diseases, robust pharmacodynamic effects mediated by selective binding to fast skeletal troponin, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and the theoretical rationale that improving calcium sensitivity can augment force production in weakened muscle fibers (Andrews et al., 2018; Rudnicki et al., 2021). Conversely, its weaknesses include the absence of direct efficacy data in IBM, potential challenges in translating improvements in contractility into meaningful functional outcomes in the face of proteostasis defects, and the need to further examine long-term safety in a population with chronic muscle inflammation and degeneration (Alsulami & Marston, 2020; Hwang & Sykes, 2015). Given the complexity of IBM pathology, reldesemtiv may be best leveraged as part of a combinatorial therapeutic approach that not only enhances contractility but also addresses inflammatory and degenerative aspects of the disease. Overall, while further preclinical studies in IBM-specific models and dedicated clinical trials will be essential to validate efficacy, the mechanistic rationale and therapeutic history of reldesemtiv strongly support its consideration as a promising repurposed candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hansen et al., 2014).

Spermidine,"Proposal for Spermidine

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Spermidine is a naturally occurring polyamine present in all living cells that plays a critical role in cellular growth, proliferation, and homeostasis. Originally discovered in semen and later identified in a variety of dietary sources, spermidine is biosynthesized endogenously via the polyamine pathway and can also be supplemented through the diet. It belongs to the class of small naturally occurring polyamines, which also includes putrescine and spermine. Polyamines have been implicated historically in longevity and stress resistance, and have been explored as nutraceuticals for their cytoprotective properties. In particular, the use of spermidine has been promoted in several preclinical models of aging and muscle degeneration, where it functions primarily as an autophagy inducer. Its chemical structure permits it to interact with DNA, RNA, and proteins, thereby modulating acetylation, mitochondrial function, and protein homeostasis. This candidate is appealing for repurposing because of its oral bioavailability, well‐documented absorption–distribution–metabolism–excretion (ADME) profile, and low toxicity as a naturally occurring dietary component (Madeo et al., 2019; Freitag, 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Spermidine has a well-documented history in preclinical research, primarily focusing on its effects as an autophagy inducer and its capability to extend lifespan via enhanced proteostasis and mitochondrial quality control. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that spermidine supplementation can restore autophagic flux in aged tissues and prevent degenerative changes in multiple organ systems, including the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. In particular, animal studies in models of muscular dystrophies – such as the collagen VI-deficient mouse model – have shown that oral or intraperitoneal administration of spermidine ameliorates myopathic defects, improves mitochondrial integrity, and reduces apoptosis in muscle fibers (Chrisam et al., 2015; Gambarotto et al., 2023). Although there is compelling preclinical evidence demonstrating beneficial effects on muscle pathology in contexts such as aging and collagen VI-related myopathies, a targeted search on ClinicalTrials.gov combining spermidine with terms like “Inclusion Body Myositis,” “muscle disease,” and “autophagy induction” has yielded no registered clinical trials to date (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This clearly indicates that while spermidine has been studied extensively in related muscle diseases and aging models, it has not yet been directly tested in clinical trials for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). The available safety data from pilot studies and nutritional interventions support its low toxicity profile, creating a strong rationale for repurposing this compound for IBM if translational preclinical data continue to be positive (Galasso et al., 2023; Chrisam et al., 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
Spermidine exerts its effects primarily by acting as a robust inducer of autophagy—a cellular degradation process essential for clearing damaged organelles, misfolded protein aggregates, and other cellular debris. One of the key mechanisms by which spermidine induces autophagy is through the inhibition of the acetyltransferase EP300. EP300 normally functions to acetylate autophagy-related proteins, thereby repressing their activity. Inhibition of EP300 by spermidine reduces the acetylation of proteins such as ATG5, ATG7, and LC3, facilitating the formation of autophagosomes and promoting autophagic flux (Cervelli et al., 2018; Zimmermann et al., 2023). Additionally, spermidine is known to activate transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy gene expression. TFEB activation leads to the upregulation of genes required for generating lysosomes and other components of the autophagy machinery, thereby enhancing the degradation capacity of cells. This dual mechanism—EP300 inhibition coupled with TFEB activation—results in enhanced clearance of protein aggregates and improvement in cellular proteostasis. Furthermore, spermidine modulates key intracellular signaling pathways, such as decreasing AKT phosphorylation. Reduced AKT activity lifts the inhibition on FOXO transcription factors, which then translocate into the nucleus and promote the expression of autophagy genes (Chrisam et al., 2015; Galasso et al., 2023). Recent investigations also highlight the role of spermidine-induced hypusination of translation factors (e.g., EIF5A) in promoting the synthesis of autophagy proteins, further enhancing autophagic capacity (Hofer et al., 2021). This intricate network of molecular interactions underpins spermidine’s abilities not only in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and cellular quality control but also in restoring muscle cellular function under pathological conditions (Cervelli et al., 2018; Chrisam et al., 2015).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed hypothesis for Inclusion Body Myositis, spermidine is expected to activate TFEB in IBM patient-derived myotubes, which would then lead to increased lysosomal biogenesis and improved autophagic clearance of protein inclusions. IBM is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins, impaired autophagic flux, and eventual muscle fiber degeneration. By enhancing autophagy, spermidine should facilitate the degradation of these pathogenic protein aggregates, thereby improving proteostasis within the myotubes. In parallel, the inhibition of EP300 is anticipated to augment autophagic induction by reducing inhibitory acetylation events on key autophagy proteins. Together, these mechanisms are expected to restore autophagic flux and cellular homeostasis, resulting in improved force generation in the muscle fibers (Galasso et al., 2023; Chrisam et al., 2015). There is precedent for this expected effect: in collagen VI-related myopathies, spermidine treatment has been shown to ameliorate histological defects, normalize mitochondrial function, reduce apoptosis, and even trend towards improved muscle strength (Chrisam et al., 2015; Gambarotto et al., 2023). Moreover, studies in models of muscle aging have demonstrated that spermidine supplementation can enhance autophagic flux and promote the clearance of damaged mitochondria and protein aggregates, potentially leading to improved contractile performance (Galasso et al., 2023; Freitag, 2023). In the context of IBM patient-derived myotubes, these effects could translate into enhanced force generation and overall improved muscle cell viability. Crucially, TFEB activation has been directly linked to improvements in lysosomal function and proteostasis in muscle cells, and since TFEB is expressed and functional in skeletal muscle, it becomes a valid target for this strategy (Cervelli et al., 2018; Chrisam et al., 2015).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, spermidine represents a promising candidate for the repurposing strategy aimed at treating Inclusion Body Myositis due to its multifaceted ability to enhance autophagy and promote cellular homeostasis. One of the major strengths of spermidine is its established safety profile as a naturally occurring dietary polyamine, along with well-documented ADME characteristics and minimal toxicity in both preclinical models and pilot human studies (Madeo et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The molecular mechanism by which spermidine acts—through EP300 inhibition, TFEB activation, and modulation of the AKT-FOXO signaling axis—is robust and supported by preclinical evidence in diverse muscle disease models, including collagen VI-deficient mice and models of muscle aging (Chrisam et al., 2015; Cervelli et al., 2018; Galasso et al., 2023). The expected effect in IBM, which includes the activation of autophagy leading to enhanced lysosomal biogenesis and clearance of protein inclusions, addresses key pathogenic events in IBM pathology, such as protein aggregate accumulation and impaired muscle fiber function (Galasso et al., 2023; Freitag, 2023).

However, there are several challenges and weaknesses to consider. Although spermidine’s action in muscle diseases has been well established in various preclinical models, direct data on its efficacy in IBM is currently lacking, as noted by the absence of clinical trials specifically targeting IBM with spermidine (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This gap necessitates rigorous preclinical validation in IBM-specific models before clinical translation. Additionally, while spermidine is known to induce autophagy via EP300 inhibition and TFEB activation, the precise regulation of these pathways can be dose-dependent, with excessive autophagy potentially leading to adverse cellular effects; indeed, some studies have noted that high doses of spermidine in wild-type models may induce excessive autophagic activity and apoptosis (Chrisam et al., 2015; Galasso et al., 2023). Therefore, dosing optimization will be critical for ensuring a therapeutic window that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks. Another consideration is the translation of improved autophagic clearance into functional improvements in force generation. While preclinical models of collagen VI-related myopathies have demonstrated promising histological and ultrastructural recovery, it remains to be shown that these molecular changes translate into significant functional gains in the context of IBM, which has complex and multifactorial pathogenesis (Chrisam et al., 2015; Gambarotto et al., 2023).

From a target validation perspective, the hypothesis that spermidine will activate TFEB in IBM patient-derived myotubes is well grounded in the literature linking TFEB activation to improved lysosomal biogenesis and clearance of pathological protein aggregates. TFEB is a critical regulator of autophagy and is expressed in skeletal muscle cells, where it drives the transcription of lysosomal and autophagy-related genes. The evidence supporting spermidine’s ability to modulate TFEB and other autophagic pathways is compelling, particularly in the context of muscle maintenance and aging (Cervelli et al., 2018; Hofer et al., 2024). This mechanistic insight supports the potential translational applicability of spermidine in IBM, where the accumulation of protein inclusions is a hallmark pathological feature.

In summary, the repurposing of spermidine for Inclusion Body Myositis is based on a strong mechanistic rationale and is supported by a robust body of preclinical evidence in related muscle diseases and aging models. Its multifactorial mechanism—including EP300 inhibition, TFEB activation, AKT-FOXO pathway modulation, and enhancement of autophagic flux—directly addresses the deficits observed in IBM, such as impaired proteostasis and lysosomal dysfunction. The therapeutic advantages of an orally administrable, low-toxicity compound further enhance its appeal as a candidate for further investigation (Chrisam et al., 2015; Madeo et al., 2019). Notwithstanding these strengths, the absence of direct preclinical and clinical data in IBM, the challenge of dosing optimization, and the potential for off-target effects remain important hurdles that must be addressed. Nonetheless, given the current evidence base and the promising mechanistic attributes, spermidine offers a novel and feasible approach for targeting autophagy defects in IBM, warranting further preclinical studies in IBM-specific models and subsequent early-phase clinical trials to fully determine its efficacy and safety in this patient population (Galasso et al., 2023; Chrisam et al., 2015).

Overall, while additional data and rigorous translational studies are required, the scientific proposal for employing spermidine as a repurposed drug candidate in Inclusion Body Myositis is well supported by the current literature on autophagy induction, proteostasis, and muscle regeneration. This candidate presents a promising avenue of therapeutic intervention that leverages known mechanisms of action in a novel context, and its further evaluation could significantly advance drug development efforts in this challenging muscle disease.

ML-SA1,"Proposal for ML-SA1

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
ML‐SA1 is a synthetic small‐molecule agonist specifically developed to activate TRPML1, a lysosomal Ca²⁺ channel that controls diverse lysosomal functions such as calcium release, membrane trafficking, exocytosis, and autophagy regulation (Gu, 2020). Originally discovered during biochemical screens targeting TRPML1 activity, ML‐SA1 belongs to a class of agents that modulate lysosomal ion channels by stabilizing the channel’s open conformation independent of endogenous lipid agonists like PI(3,5)P₂ (Feng et al., 2014). Over the past years, compounds of this class have been extensively used in preclinical studies to probe the roles of lysosomal calcium in cellular clearance pathways. ML‐SA1, as a selective TRPML1 activator, exemplifies this strategy, and its chemical synthesis involves standard organic synthetic routes that yield a molecule capable of permeating cellular membranes, allowing it to reach intracellular lysosomes where TRPML1 is expressed (Gu, 2020). This candidate is representative of the novel approach of directly modulating lysosomal function via targeted ion channel activation—in this case, by enhancing lysosomal calcium release, which in turn has multiple downstream cellular effects, especially on autophagy and membrane repair.

Therapeutic History:
To date, ML‐SA1 and related TRPML1 agonists have been primarily evaluated in preclinical models investigating lysosomal storage disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and models of muscular dystrophy (Yu, 2019). In models of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), for instance, pharmacological activation of TRPML1 with ML‐SA1 analogs has been shown to promote lysosomal exocytosis and improve membrane repair in muscle fibers, leading to reduced muscle damage, improved muscle force, and decreased markers of necrosis (Gu, 2020; Yu, 2019). Although there have been no well‐documented clinical trials specifically addressing Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) with ML‐SA1, ongoing clinical trials targeting TRPML1 for myopathies and related muscle diseases indicate that there is growing translational interest in using TRPML1 activators as therapeutic agents for conditions characterized by lysosomal dysfunction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Beyond muscular dystrophy, preclinical research in neural cell models has demonstrated that activation of TRPML1 via ML‐SA1 can mitigate neurotoxic stress, improve autophagic clearance, and reduce protein aggregate build‐up (Tedeschi et al., 2019), which parallels the pathophysiological mechanisms observed in IBM. This historical therapeutic context provides a compelling rationale for repurposing ML‐SA1 from its original indications to IBM, as both diseases share common underlying features such as impaired autophagy, accumulation of intracellular aggregates, and disrupted lysosomal calcium signaling.

Mechanism of Action:
ML‐SA1 acts through a well‐defined mechanism of selectively binding to TRPML1 in lysosomal membranes and inducing a conformational change that favors the open state of the channel (Feng et al., 2014). Once activated, TRPML1 mediates the release of Ca²⁺ from the lysosomal lumen into the cytosol, which is critical for several downstream cellular events. One major consequence of the induced lysosomal Ca²⁺ release is the activation of calcineurin, a Ca²⁺/calmodulin‐dependent phosphatase that dephosphorylates transcription factor EB (TFEB) (Yu, 2019). Dephosphorylated TFEB then translocates into the nucleus where it upregulates the expression of lysosomal and autophagic genes, a collection of genes that comprise the Coordinated Lysosomal Expression and Regulation (CLEAR) network (Gu, 2020; Yu, 2019). Besides TFEB activation, lysosomal Ca²⁺ released by TRPML1 also promotes lysosomal exocytosis—a process vital for plasma membrane repair in muscle cells—by facilitating the fusion of lysosomes with the sarcolemma (Gu, 2020; Yu, 2019). This interplay is particularly significant in muscle repair pathways where a rapid and efficient resealing of the plasma membrane is essential to combat ongoing mechanical stress. Additionally, ML‐SA1 is known to trigger retrograde lysosomal transport by modulating calcium‐sensitive SNARE proteins and cytoskeletal motors, further ensuring that autophagosomes are efficiently fused with lysosomes to degrade damaged proteins and organelles (Yu, 2019). The high specificity of ML‐SA1 to TRPML1 means that its use results in minimal off‐target effects, and this precision makes it an attractive candidate for therapeutic intervention in diseases where lysosomal dysfunction is a critical factor—such as Inclusion Body Myositis.

Expected Effect:
For Inclusion Body Myositis, the central hypothesis is that impaired autophagy and lysosomal dysfunction contribute significantly to the accumulation of protein aggregates and consequent muscle degeneration. Activation of TRPML1 by ML‐SA1 is anticipated to restore lysosomal Ca²⁺ signaling in myotubes derived from IBM patients, thereby correcting a critical cellular defect (Yu, 2019). When ML‐SA1 stimulates TRPML1, the burst of lysosomal Ca²⁺ triggers downstream signaling cascades resulting in the nuclear translocation of TFEB. In the nucleus, TFEB binds to CLEAR motifs and thereby induces a transcriptional program that enhances lysosomal biogenesis and autophagic flux. This upregulation should theoretically facilitate the clearance of misfolded proteins and toxic aggregates that are hallmarks of IBM pathology (Gu, 2020; Yu, 2019). In addition to clearing aggregates, the enhanced lysosomal exocytosis means that damaged cellular membranes, such as the sarcolemma of myotubes, are more efficiently repaired, ultimately improving contractility and overall muscle cell health (Yu, 2019). Preclinical data from rodent models of muscular dystrophy have already demonstrated that ML‐SA1 analogs can distribute into muscle tissue following systemic administration and that they reduce markers of muscle damage while improving functional outcomes (Yu, 2019). Extrapolating these findings to IBM, one could expect that ML‐SA1 treatment will not only clear pathological protein inclusions but also restore the cellular capacity for autophagic clearance and membrane repair, which in turn could translate into improved muscle strength, reduced fibrosis, and overall better muscle performance in patients with IBM.

Overall Evaluation:
ML‐SA1 emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis due to its targeted mechanism of action, demonstrable efficacy in preclinical muscle disease models, and ability to modulate key pathological mechanisms underlying IBM. One of the major strengths of ML‐SA1 is its specificity for TRPML1, ensuring that its activation leads to a cascade of beneficial cellular processes, including lysosomal calcium release, TFEB activation, autophagy enhancement, and improved lysosomal exocytosis (Gu, 2020; Yu, 2019). Furthermore, its chemical structure as a synthetic small molecule not only facilitates robust production and formulation but also offers favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including muscle tissue distribution, as shown in rodent studies (Yu, 2019). The expected outcome in IBM myotubes is that direct modulation of lysosomal calcium, via ML‐SA1, will restore cellular protein homeostasis by eliminating aggregates and repairing membrane damage, thereby improving contractility. This hypothesis is innovative because it addresses a fundamental cellular defect in IBM—a block in autophagic clearance—by directly enhancing lysosomal function through TRPML1 activation (Yu, 2019).

However, there are also some weaknesses and uncertainties that merit consideration. First, although there is compelling preclinical evidence in muscular dystrophy and neurodegenerative models, the direct application of ML‐SA1 in IBM has not been extensively validated, and the pathophysiological nuances of IBM may introduce unique challenges that differ from other muscle diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while activation of TFEB is beneficial for lysosomal biogenesis, excessive autophagy activation could potentially have deleterious effects in muscle, and balancing the degree of activation will be critical to avoid unwanted catabolic effects (Yu, 2019). Moreover, long‐term effects of chronic TRPML1 activation remain underexplored, and potential issues such as compensatory downregulation or off‐target effects in non‐muscle tissues require thorough investigation (Yu, 2019). Finally, while rodent PK studies have shown promising muscle distribution, the translation of these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles to human subjects needs to be rigorously evaluated in clinical trials focused specifically on IBM.

In summary, ML‐SA1’s ability to enhance lysosomal Ca²⁺ release and thereby trigger TFEB nuclear translocation and upregulate autophagy presents a mechanistically sound and innovative approach for treating Inclusion Body Myositis. Its past success in ameliorating muscle pathology in DMD models, combined with its potent and selective mechanism of action, provide strong support for further testing in IBM. However, additional research—both preclinical studies in IBM-specific models and early-phase human trials—will be essential to validate efficacy and safety in the context of IBM. Overall, while there are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with any novel therapeutic approach, the potential benefits of restoring lysosomal function and autophagic clearance in diseased muscle tissues make ML‐SA1 an attractive candidate that merits further investigation (Gu, 2020; Yu, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

─────────────────────────────
Overview of Therapeutic Candidate

Elamipretide (SS-31) is a synthetic tetrapeptide belonging to the Szeto–Schiller (SS) family that was originally discovered through focused peptide–engineering approaches aimed at designing molecules capable of targeting mitochondria. Its structure, consisting of an alternating pattern of aromatic and cationic residues (specifically D-Arg, 2′,6′-dimethylTyr, Lys, and Phe–NH₂), confers a net positive charge and amphipathic characteristics that are essential for rapid cellular uptake and accumulation within the mitochondrial inner membrane (Ahmed et al., 2018). The chemical synthesis is undertaken with standard solid‐phase peptide synthesis methods, ensuring that the final product is of high purity and can be manufactured reproducibly for both preclinical and clinical studies (Stefaniak et al., 2024). SS-31 is classified as a mitochondrial‐targeted peptide therapeutic, a novel class that has been developed to restore mitochondrial bioenergetics by selectively binding to key mitochondrial lipids such as cardiolipin (Mitchell et al., 2019). Cardiolipin is exclusively located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is critical for maintaining the architecture of mitochondrial cristae, organizing the electron transport chain (ETC) into supercomplexes, and ensuring efficient ATP production (Mitchell et al., 2019). The unique design of Elamipretide allows it to rapidly accumulate within skeletal muscle cells in preclinical models, lending support to its potential use in muscle diseases like IBM where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a prominent role (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Overall, its synthetic origins, precise molecular design, and ability to target the mitochondrial inner membrane position Elamipretide as an attractive candidate for repurposing in disorders characterized by energy failure and oxidative stress.

─────────────────────────────
Therapeutic History

Elamipretide has been evaluated across a broad range of preclinical and clinical contexts where mitochondrial dysfunction is a prominent feature. In preclinical animal studies, particularly using rodent and canine models, treatment with SS-31 improved various aspects of mitochondrial function, including enhancement of mitochondrial respiration, stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Ryan et al., 2016). These studies have demonstrated that chronic administration of Elamipretide can restore critical parameters of mitochondrial health in models of heart failure and ischemia–reperfusion injury, with improvements seen in skeletal and cardiac muscle function (Ryan et al., 2016). In addition to cardiac applications, preclinical evaluations have addressed skeletal muscle performance, where treatment reversed age-related mitochondrial declines and improved exercise endurance (Campbell et al., 2022). Safety and tolerability profiles in early-phase clinical trials have been encouraging; for example, clinical investigations in patients with primary mitochondrial myopathies established that Elamipretide is generally well tolerated and exhibits some beneficial effects on mitochondrial biomarkers—even though not all primary functional endpoints were met in the pivotal MMPOWER-3 study (Karaa et al., 2023). In addition, studies in canine models of heart failure demonstrated that SS-31 improved mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle, further supporting its application in muscle pathologies (Sabbah et al., 2019). Despite these extensive studies in diseases with mitochondrial impairment, no clinical trial to date has specifically addressed Inclusion Body Myositis, though the underlying mitochondrial deficits shared between mitochondrial myopathies and IBM strongly justify a repurposing approach (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

─────────────────────────────
Mechanism of Action

At the molecular level, the efficacy of Elamipretide stems from its well-characterized mechanism of selectively binding to cardiolipin within the mitochondrial inner membrane. Cardiolipin acts as a linchpin for maintaining mitochondrial structure—stabilizing the cristae architecture, anchoring cytochrome c, and organizing ETC complexes into supercomplexes—and its oxidation is known to result in impaired ATP synthesis and increased ROS production (Mitchell et al., 2019). The amphipathic nature of SS-31 enables it to engage in dual interactions with cardiolipin. Electrostatic interactions occur between its cationic residues (arginine and lysine) and the negatively charged phosphate groups on cardiolipin, while the hydrophobic interactions arise between its aromatic residues (2′,6′-dimethyltyrosine and phenylalanine) and the acyl chains of cardiolipin (Mitchell et al., 2019). This dual binding protects cardiolipin from oxidative modifications and helps maintain the integrity of mitochondrial cristae, preserving the functional assembly of ETC supercomplexes (Karaa et al., 2023).

Beyond simply protecting cardiolipin, Elamipretide exerts significant effects on mitochondrial surface electrostatics. Biophysical studies utilizing fluorescence titration and calorimetry have shown that SS-31 reduces the negative surface potential of the mitochondrial inner membrane (Mitchell et al., 2019). This modulation of membrane charge is critical for ensuring optimal ion interactions, particularly with ADP and calcium. For instance, improved ADP sensitivity of the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) has been observed following SS-31 treatment, which facilitates more efficient ADP import and, consequently, enhanced ATP synthesis (Pharaoh et al., 2023). Studies using molecular dynamics simulations have detailed the dynamic orientation of SS-31 as it interacts with lipid bilayers, confirming that its insertion into the membrane preserves optimal lipid packing and prevents deleterious changes in membrane fluidity (Mitchell et al., 2019). Overall, these molecular interactions stabilize mitochondrial function by reducing electron leak, minimizing ROS generation, and maintaining robust ATP production—a combination of effects particularly relevant in tissues suffering from energy deficits as seen in IBM (Mitchell et al., 2019).

Additional investigations have revealed that SS-31’s beneficial actions include protecting against pathological calcium influx events by modulating the overall ionic environment at the membrane interface (Mitchell et al., 2019). This property is especially important because calcium overload is known to trigger mitochondrial permeability transition and subsequent apoptotic cascades. By preserving membrane structure and moderating ion interactions, Elamipretide enhances mitochondrial resilience under stress conditions (Mitchell et al., 2019). Furthermore, structural studies have supported that SS-31 integrates into the mitochondrial inner membrane in a manner that does not disrupt the lamellar structure but rather supports the organization and stability of critical respiratory complexes, reinforcing its potential for disease modification in myopathies (Mitchell et al., 2019).

─────────────────────────────
Expected Effect in Inclusion Body Myositis

Inclusion Body Myositis is characterized by progressive muscle weakness, fiber atrophy, and features of both inflammatory and degenerative pathology, with mitochondrial dysfunction being a notable component. Histopathologic and biochemical analyses of IBM muscle have demonstrated diminished ATP production, abnormal mitochondrial networks, and increased oxidative damage. Given these abnormalities, the central hypothesis is that Elamipretide’s mitochondrial-targeted actions will translate into clinically relevant benefits in IBM by addressing both bioenergetic deficits and oxidative stress.

Upon systemic administration—whether subcutaneously or intravenously—Elamipretide is expected to be rapidly taken up by muscle tissue. Once internalized, it localizes predominantly to the mitochondria of skeletal muscle cells where it binds to cardiolipin. This binding is proposed to restore the structural integrity of the mitochondrial inner membrane and the organization of ETC supercomplexes, which are often fragmented in IBM myotubes (Campbell et al., 2022). Consequently, improved assembly and stability of these supercomplexes will enhance electron flux through the ETC, thus reducing electron leak and resultant ROS production. Lowered ROS levels would, in turn, diminish further oxidative damage to mitochondrial and cellular proteins, lipids, and DNA, thereby interrupting vicious cycles of mitochondrial dysfunction (Karaa et al., 2023).

Another expected benefit involves the improved functioning of the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that Elamipretide enhances ANT’s sensitivity to ADP, resulting in more efficient ADP uptake and elevated ATP production in aged and dystrophic muscle tissue (Pharaoh et al., 2023). In the context of IBM, where ATP deficits contribute to impaired contractile force, this restoration of bioenergetic function is predicted to translate into improved muscle strength and endurance. Moreover, enhanced ATP synthesis coupled with reduced ROS production may also favor the preservation and repair of muscle fibers, ultimately leading to a measurable improvement in contractile performance in both in vitro IBM myotube assays and future in vivo models.

Given IBM’s multifactorial nature, where inflammatory pathways and protein misfolding events also contribute to pathology, Elamipretide’s precise mitochondrial action might be most effective if used as part of a combination therapy. However, its ability to selectively and effectively restore mitochondrial membrane potential, supercomplex integrity, and ADP uptake provides a strong mechanistic rationale for its evaluation as a monotherapy in early proof-of-concept studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Ultimately, the expected cascade of effects—from improved mitochondrial membrane stabilization to enhanced ATP production—should result in measurable gains in muscle contractility and reduced fatigue. Such an effect would be captured in experiments showing increases in mitochondrial membrane potential, stabilization of ETC complexes, improved ADP sensitivity, and enhanced in vitro contractile force in IBM-relevant models (Campbell et al., 2022; Pharaoh et al., 2023).

─────────────────────────────
Overall Evaluation

A thorough evaluation of Elamipretide as a candidate therapeutic for Inclusion Body Myositis reveals several notable strengths as well as some challenges that must be addressed. One of the primary strengths is its well-established synthetic origin and design. As a chemically synthesized tetrapeptide from the Szeto–Schiller family, its structure has been optimized for rapid cellular uptake and specific mitochondrial targeting via binding to cardiolipin (Ahmed et al., 2018; Stefaniak et al., 2024). This design has been repeatedly validated across multiple preclinical studies, lending strong support to its fundamental mechanism of action.

In terms of therapeutic history, Elamipretide has a track record of beneficial effects in several contexts of mitochondrial dysfunction. Evidence from rodent and canine models clearly demonstrates improved mitochondrial respiration, enhanced ADP uptake via the ANT, and reductions in ROS production following treatment (Ryan et al., 2016; Sabbah et al., 2019). Early-phase clinical data, particularly from trials in primary mitochondrial myopathy, confirm a favorable safety profile while indicating potential improvements in mitochondrial bioenergetics (Karaa et al., 2023). Although these trials did not always meet all primary endpoints, they nonetheless provide invaluable proof of concept in conditions characterized by impaired oxidative phosphorylation—a feature that is also central to IBM pathology.

The molecular mechanism of Elamipretide is another critical strength. Detailed biophysical studies have elucidated that its dual mode of binding—through both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions—to cardiolipin underpins its ability to restore mitochondrial structure (Mitchell et al., 2019). This interaction not only preserves the structural integrity of the mitochondrial inner membrane but also stabilizes ETC supercomplexes, thereby reducing electron leak and curbing ROS production (Mitchell et al., 2019). Furthermore, its capacity to modulate mitochondrial surface electrostatics enhances ADP sensitivity and ATP synthesis, which is essential for improving muscle contractility (Pharaoh et al., 2023).

From the perspective of the expected effect in IBM, the hypothesis that Elamipretide will bind to cardiolipin in IBM myotubes to restore mitochondrial supercomplex stability, reduce ROS production, and subsequently improve ATP-dependent contractile force is grounded in sound mechanistic data. Studies have shown that mitochondria in IBM and other myopathies are characterized by disorganized cristae and impaired energy production; hence, repairing these defects could directly contribute to improved muscle function (Campbell et al., 2022; Pharaoh et al., 2023). Its favorable preclinical muscle uptake, evidenced in rodent studies, further supports its use in disorders with localized muscle dysfunction (Campbell et al., 2023).

There are, however, several challenges and potential weaknesses. One key issue is the lack of direct clinical evidence in IBM specifically. While the robust evidence in primary mitochondrial myopathy and related conditions is promising, IBM is a complex disease with inflammatory and degenerative components apart from mitochondrial dysfunction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Optimizing the dosing regimen for IBM might require tailored pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies because muscle involvement in IBM might be heterogeneous compared to other mitochondrial diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Moreover, the MMPOWER-3 trial in primary mitochondrial myopathy indicated that while safety is reliably maintained, the clinical efficacy endpoints remain modest, raising the question of whether monotherapy with Elamipretide will fully address the multifactorial pathology observed in IBM (Karaa et al., 2023).

Another consideration is that IBM is characterized by the presence of protein aggregates and immune-mediated damage in addition to mitochondrial deficits. Elamipretide’s mechanism is focused exclusively on mitochondrial membrane stabilization and does not directly address protein aggregation or immune modulation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This suggests that while Elamipretide could potentially improve mitochondrial function and enhance muscle strength, it may need to be combined with other agents that target the broader spectrum of IBM pathophysiology for a more comprehensive therapeutic effect.

Despite these issues, the overall advantages of Elamipretide are compelling. Its reproducible chemical synthesis, well-documented mechanism of action, and an established safety profile provide an excellent platform for further investigation in IBM. Additional preclinical studies using IBM-specific in vitro models (e.g., primary IBM myotubes) or animal models that recapitulate the mitochondrial defects seen in IBM will be crucial. These studies should focus on quantifying improvements in mitochondrial supercomplex stability, membrane potential, ADP sensitivity, ROS production, and ultimately, improvements in contractile force (Mitchell et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Furthermore, sensitive biomarkers—such as mitochondrial membrane potential, levels of specific ETC components within supercomplexes, and quantifications of intracellular ROS—can serve as early readouts to guide dose optimization and efficacy evaluations. Such biomarkers could be integrated into both preclinical and early-phase clinical trials to better understand how mitochondrial target engagement correlates with functional improvements in muscle strength and endurance (Karaa et al., 2024).

In summary, Elamipretide presents a scientifically robust, innovative approach to addressing mitochondrial dysfunction—a known mediator of muscle weakness in IBM. Its proven ability to restore mitochondrial bioenergetics in multiple preclinical models, coupled with clinical data supporting its safety, makes it a strong candidate for repurposing in IBM despite the absence of direct clinical data in this indication. The next logical steps would involve:
• Establishing IBM-relevant preclinical models to evaluate Elamipretide’s ability to restore mitochondrial supercomplex integrity and function.
• Conducting detailed biomarker-driven studies to assess changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, ADP uptake, ROS production, and overall ATP production.
• Designing early-phase clinical trials with specific endpoints related to muscle strength, endurance, and mitochondrial function in IBM patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

─────────────────────────────
Overall Conclusion

Based on the integrated biomedical, biochemical, and clinical literature, Elamipretide (SS-31) emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in Inclusion Body Myositis. Its synthetic origin and chemical manufacture, bolstered by robust biophysical evidence of selective cardiolipin binding and mitochondrial stabilization, provide a sound scientific basis for its potential therapeutic benefits in IBM (Ahmed et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2019). The preclinical and clinical histories in related mitochondrial pathologies, particularly primary mitochondrial myopathies and heart failure, establish that Elamipretide can improve mitochondrial function, reduce ROS production, and increase ATP synthesis (Ryan et al., 2016; Sabbah et al., 2019).

Its specific mechanisms of action—stabilizing mitochondrial membranes through binding to cardiolipin, enhancing the organization of ETC supercomplexes, reducing oxidative stress, and improving ADP sensitivity—are directly relevant to the mitochondrial defects observed in IBM muscle (Mitchell et al., 2019; Pharaoh et al., 2023). While the absence of direct clinical trials in IBM and the multifactorial nature of the disease are valid concerns, the compelling evidence supporting mitochondrial dysfunction as a driver of muscle weakness in IBM provides a strong rationale for targeting this pathway. The favorable pharmacokinetic properties, as demonstrated in rodent muscle uptake and sustained improvements in mitochondrial indices, further strengthen the argument for advancing Elamipretide into IBM-specific studies (Campbell et al., 2023).

Nonetheless, it is important to remain cautious regarding the translation of mitochondrial improvements to functional clinical benefits in a complex disease like IBM. Early-phase trials in IBM should be structured to closely monitor mitochondrial biomarkers and correlate these with improvements in muscle performance and fatigue scores. Given the heterogeneity and additional pathological components in IBM (such as inflammatory and degenerative mechanisms), Elamipretide might ultimately be most beneficial when used in conjunction with agents that address these other aspects of the disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In conclusion, Elamipretide’s strong mechanistic rationale, established preclinical efficacy in conditions characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, and its extensive evaluation in related diseases position it as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in Inclusion Body Myositis. Further research is warranted to validate target engagement in IBM-specific models and to determine optimal dosing for affected muscle groups. If these preclinical studies are successful, early-phase clinical trials incorporating comprehensive biomarker analyses and functional performance endpoints will be essential to determine whether Elamipretide can achieve meaningful improvement in muscle strength and endurance in IBM patients (Karaa et al., 2024). Overall, while challenges remain, the promising data support continued investment in Elamipretide as an innovative, mitochondria-targeted therapeutic with the potential to address a significant unmet need in Inclusion Body Myositis.

Final Remarks

Elamipretide (SS-31) offers a unique intervention strategy that directly addresses mitochondrial dysfunction—an important pathophysiological feature of Inclusion Body Myositis. The compound’s robust synthetic origins and precise molecular design, evident from its selective binding to cardiolipin and stabilization of mitochondrial membranes, lay a solid foundation for its repurposing potential (Ahmed et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2019). Its extensive therapeutic history in models of heart failure, primary mitochondrial myopathies, and aging-related muscle decline, along with a favorable safety profile in multiple clinical trials, further bolster its promise (Karaa et al., 2023; Ryan et al., 2016).

While IBM presents additional complexities due to inflammatory and degenerative components, the mitochondrial pathology observed in IBM provides a rational basis for pursuing therapies that restore mitochondrial function. Elamipretide’s demonstrated ability to enhance ATP production, improve ADP sensitivity via effects on the adenine nucleotide translocator, and reduce mitochondrial ROS is particularly relevant to improving muscle contractility in IBM (Pharaoh et al., 2023; Mitchell et al., 2019).

Looking ahead, further detailed studies using IBM-specific preclinical models are essential to define the extent to which mitochondrial supercomplex stabilization by Elamipretide translates into functional improvements in muscle tissue. In parallel, biomarker development and dose optimization studies will be critical to informing clinical trial design in IBM populations. Although challenges related to disease heterogeneity and the possibility of only modest improvements as monotherapy exist, the combination of favorable mechanistic action and reproducible clinical safety forms a compelling case for its continued evaluation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

In summary, based on the current integrated literature, Elamipretide stands out as an innovative and scientifically rational candidate for further investigation in Inclusion Body Myositis. With strategic preclinical experiments and carefully designed early-phase clinical studies, this mitochondrial‐targeted peptide has the potential to become a valuable disease‐modifying therapy for IBM, a condition that currently lacks effective therapeutic options (El-Hattab et al., 2017). The collective evidence strongly supports further investment in Elamipretide research as part of a broader effort to improve muscle bioenergetics and function in patients suffering from this challenging disease.

By leveraging the precise molecular interactions of Elamipretide with mitochondrial membranes and its established effect on electron transport chain stabilization and ROS reduction, there is a robust rationale to test whether these benefits can be translated to improved muscle contractility and reduced fatigue in IBM. A focused translational research program is warranted to bridge the gap between the promising preclinical data and clinical efficacy, ultimately aiming to offer a novel, mitochondria-targeted therapeutic avenue for patients with Inclusion Body Myositis (Karaa et al., 2024; Mitchell et al., 2019).

In closing, while challenges remain in addressing the complete spectrum of IBM pathology, Elamipretide’s mechanism of restoring mitochondrial function through cardiolipin stabilization presents a unique and promising treatment strategy. The ongoing research in mitochondrial-targeted therapeutics provides a solid foundation for moving this candidate forward into rigorously designed IBM-specific studies, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes for patients with this debilitating disorder (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Pharaoh et al., 2023).

Final Summary

Elamipretide (SS-31) is a synthetic mitochondrial‐targeted peptide discovered and developed using advanced peptide engineering techniques, characterized by its specific binding to cardiolipin in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Its therapeutic history spans successful preclinical models addressing conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction and multiple early-phase clinical trials in primary mitochondrial disorders that confirm its safety profile and potential to improve bioenergetic parameters. Mechanistically, Elamipretide acts by stabilizing the mitochondrial inner membrane, preserving ETC supercomplex assembly, and reducing oxidative stress while enhancing ADP uptake—all critical functions compromised in Inclusion Body Myositis. Although direct clinical evidence in IBM remains to be generated, the substantial overlap in mitochondrial pathology between IBM and other mitochondrial myopathies supports the rationale for its repurposing. With further preclinical validation focused on IBM-specific models and optimization of dosing regimens in affected muscle tissue, Elamipretide has the potential to significantly improve muscle contractility and patient outcomes in IBM. Given the urgent unmet need in this field, further investment in the translational development of Elamipretide is both scientifically justified and clinically promising (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Karaa et al., 2024).

Overall, while combination therapies may ultimately be needed to address the full spectrum of IBM pathology, the singular mitochondrial targeting offered by Elamipretide represents a novel and high-potential therapeutic strategy worthy of further rigorous investigation.

Urolithin A,"Proposal for Urolithin A

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Urolithin A is a naturally occurring compound derived from the microbial metabolism of ellagitannins, a family of polyphenolic compounds present in fruits such as pomegranates, berries, and nuts. It is produced endogenously in the human gut when the resident microbiota convert dietary ellagic acid and ellagitannins into urolithins. In recent years, synthetic methods have also been developed for obtaining pure Urolithin A, thereby ensuring standardized formulations for research and therapeutic use (Djedjibegovic et al., 2020; Wilhelmsen et al., 2025). Pharmacologically, Urolithin A belongs to the class of gut microbiota-derived postbiotic metabolites with potent mitochondrial modulatory activity. This class of compounds has been investigated primarily for their ability to improve mitochondrial quality control through the induction of mitophagy—a process in which damaged mitochondria are selectively degraded and recycled. Traditionally, polyphenol derivatives and their microbial metabolites have been explored as nutraceuticals to combat age-related muscle decline; Urolithin A exemplifies these attributes by offering a mechanistic link between dietary intake, gut microbial metabolism, and improved cellular bioenergetics (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Therapeutic History:
Biochemical and clinical studies have highlighted Urolithin A’s activity in improving mitochondrial function in aging muscle and other tissues. Preclinical animal models, including studies in Caenorhabditis elegans, rodents, and muscle cell cultures, have demonstrated that Urolithin A can extend lifespan, improve muscle function, and enhance mitochondrial biogenesis through the activation of autophagic pathways (Faitg et al., 2024; Toney et al., 2021). Phase I human clinical trials have confirmed that oral supplementation with Urolithin A is safe and results in a dose‐dependent upregulation of mitochondrial gene expression in skeletal muscle, along with enhanced markers of mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress metabolites (Singh et al., 2019; Amazentis SA, 2019). Although Urolithin A has not been directly used in clinical studies targeting Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), its prior applications in improving muscle mitochondrial function, endurance, and overall cellular health in aging populations provide a strong rationale for its repurposing. No direct therapeutic studies have yet been conducted in IBM patients; however, the similarity in the pathophysiology of mitochondrial dysfunction between age-related sarcopenia and IBM supports the hypothesis that Urolithin A may ameliorate muscle degeneration via its mitophagy-inducing effects (Jayatunga et al., 2021; Mantzourani et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Urolithin A is recognized for its ability to activate mitophagy through multiple interconnected pathways. Its mechanism involves the upregulation of key genes and proteins that orchestrate mitochondrial quality control. Preclinical studies have shown that Urolithin A induces the expression and activity of PINK1 and Parkin—two critical mediators in the mitophagy pathway. Under conditions of mitochondrial damage, PINK1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane and recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which tags dysfunctional mitochondria for degradation. By stimulating the PINK1/Parkin pathway, Urolithin A facilitates the recognition and clearance of impaired mitochondria, thereby reducing the burden of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promoting cellular health (Faitg et al., 2024; Moradi, 2022).

In addition to the canonical PINK1/Parkin pathway, Urolithin A has been reported to modulate other regulators of mitochondrial dynamics. It upregulates transcription factors such as TFEB and PGC-1α, which are involved in autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis, respectively. This coordinated response not only aids in the removal of damaged mitochondria but also stimulates the generation of new, functionally competent mitochondria, thereby improving overall cellular energy homeostasis (Hou et al., 2024; Faitg et al., 2024). Moreover, Urolithin A has been shown to promote the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, a critical step that ensures the efficient degradation of mitochondrial components. This autophagosome–lysosome fusion is essential for complete mitophagic flux and is supported by proteomic analyses that reveal upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes and markers of mitochondrial abundance (Jayatunga et al., 2021; Mantzourani et al., 2024).

The compound exerts additional protective effects by reducing the cellular levels of ROS, which are often elevated in conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction. Elevated ROS can contribute to sarcomere damage, protein oxidation, and subsequent muscle weakness—a hallmark of neuromuscular degeneration as seen in IBM. By decreasing ROS-mediated damage, Urolithin A potentially preserves the integrity of contractile proteins and maintains muscle force (Amazentis SA, 2024; Djedjibegovic et al., 2020). The molecular interactions of Urolithin A extend beyond these key players to involve modulation of inflammatory pathways; it has been shown to reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and CRP, further contributing to an environment conducive to muscle repair and regeneration (Toney et al., 2021; Jayatunga et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for using Urolithin A in Inclusion Body Myositis stems from its established effects in preclinical models of muscle aging. IBM is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates and dysfunctional mitochondria, leading to chronic inflammation and progressive muscle weakness. The expected effect of Urolithin A in IBM myotubes would be the activation of mitophagy via upregulation of the PINK1/Parkin axis, thereby clearing dysfunctional mitochondria and reducing the cellular load of ROS. In turn, this reduction in oxidative stress is anticipated to alleviate sarcomere damage that contributes to the decline in muscle contractility (Faitg et al., 2024; Jayatunga et al., 2021).

In the proposed assay, IBM myotubes derived from patient muscle biopsies or relevant IBM cell models would be treated with Urolithin A. Key readouts would include the assessment of mitophagy markers—such as increased expression of PINK1, Parkin, and LC3-II—and a reduction in ROS levels, as measured by standard biochemical assays. These biochemical improvements should correlate with functional endpoints, such as enhanced contractile force in ex vivo muscle preparations or improved mitochondrial respiration as measured by oxygen consumption assays (Li et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2019). The activation of autophagosome–lysosome fusion, a specific action of Urolithin A, is critical because it ensures that the upregulated mitophagy indeed results in effective clearance of damaged mitochondria, rather than merely increasing autophagosome formation without subsequent degradation. The literature provides evidence that this mechanism supports recovery of mitochondrial quality and improves muscle force recovery in aging models, and a similar benefit is expected in the context of IBM (Moradi, 2022; Mantzourani et al., 2024).

Furthermore, gene expression analyses in IBM myotubes treated with Urolithin A are expected to show upregulation of transcription factors such as TFEB—a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis—and PGC-1α, which promotes mitochondrial biogenesis. These changes should synergistically lead to both a decrease in the accumulation of defective mitochondria and an increase in the number of functional mitochondria, thereby restoring cellular energy balance and muscle contractile function. Additionally, because inclusion body myositis is associated with chronic low-level inflammation, the anti-inflammatory properties of Urolithin A may attenuate inflammatory signaling, further contributing to improved muscle health (Jayatunga et al., 2021; Toney et al., 2021).

Overall, proteomic and transcriptomic data from prior studies in aging human muscle correlate improved mitochondrial quality with enhanced muscle strength and endurance after Urolithin A supplementation. These findings suggest that in IBM, a similar mechanistic basis may yield restored muscle force and reduced progression of muscle degeneration when dysfunctional mitochondria are efficiently cleared (Moradi, 2022; Li et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Urolithin A presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis due to its multifaceted mechanism of action that directly addresses mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress—two central features of the disease pathology. Its natural origin as a gut microbiota-derived metabolite and established safety profile in phase I clinical trials support its developmental feasibility. The fact that Urolithin A has been shown to stimulate the PINK1/Parkin pathway, enhance autophagosome–lysosome fusion, and upregulate critical regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis (TFEB and PGC-1α) makes it mechanistically well-suited for restoring muscle force in diseases characterized by mitochondrial impairment and ROS-mediated sarcomere damage (Faitg et al., 2024; Hou et al., 2024).

Strengths of Urolithin A include its dual role in promoting mitochondrial turnover and attenuating inflammatory processes, both of which are considered important in managing neuromuscular disorders such as IBM. The compound’s status as a nutritional supplement with well-characterized pharmacokinetics further enhances its appeal, as it can be rapidly advanced into clinical studies without the extensive safety concerns usually associated with new chemical entities (Singh et al., 2019; Amazentis SA, 2019). Moreover, the existing clinical evidence demonstrating improved mitochondrial gene expression and reductions in plasma acylcarnitine levels in healthy elderly individuals suggests that its use as a mitochondrial enhancer is both effective and clinically translatable (Amazentis SA, 2024; Mantzourani et al., 2024).

However, there are also challenges to consider. Although preclinical studies in aging models provide a strong rationale, there is no direct clinical evidence of efficacy in IBM or even in muscle diseases specifically characterized by inclusion bodies. The underlying pathology of IBM is complex, with inflammatory components, protein aggregation, and autoimmune features that may not be fully addressed by solely enhancing mitophagy. Additional studies will be required to determine whether the mitochondrial improvements seen with Urolithin A translate into meaningful clinical benefits in the context of IBM, where the interplay between degeneration and inflammation is pronounced (Jayatunga et al., 2021; Mantzourani et al., 2024). Furthermore, given the heterogeneity in human gut microbiota and the metabolic differences among individuals (the so‐called urolithin metabotypes), there may be variability in response to Urolithin A supplementation, which must be carefully considered in clinical trial design (Vini et al., 2022).

Despite these challenges, the mechanistic specificity of Urolithin A in promoting autophagosome–lysosome fusion and clearing damaged mitochondria provides a solid scientific foundation for its use in IBM. The proposal’s focus on restoring contractile function through improved mitochondrial turnover is strongly supported by data from aging models where mitochondrial quality control correlates with muscle force recovery (Moradi, 2022; Li et al., 2022). The expected translational outcome—mitophagy induction leading to reduced ROS levels and preservation of sarcomere structure—aligns closely with the needs for therapeutic intervention in IBM. Current clinical trials evaluating Urolithin A in other contexts (e.g., glucose metabolism in older adults, pharmacokinetic evaluations in healthy volunteers) further reinforce the compound’s developmental feasibility and safety profile (National Institute on Aging, 2024; Amazentis SA, 2024).

In summary, Urolithin A exhibits significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis. Its ability to activate mitophagy via PINK1/Parkin, enhance autophagosome–lysosome fusion, reduce oxidative stress, and ultimately restore mitochondrial function and muscle strength positions it as a scientifically compelling candidate. The strengths of established clinical safety, well-documented mechanistic basis, and preclinical evidence of improved muscle function outweigh the current limitations regarding direct evidence in IBM. Moving forward, focused preclinical studies in IBM-relevant models and carefully designed pilot clinical trials will be essential to validate Urolithin A’s efficacy in this challenging neuromuscular disease (Djedjibegovic et al., 2020; Toney et al., 2021).

Overall, based on the comprehensive review of biochemical, clinical, and mechanistic literature, Urolithin A is a promising candidate for repurposing as a treatment for Inclusion Body Myositis, warranting further investigation in this specific disease context (Jayatunga et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022).

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of roflumilast as a repurposing candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). The discussion is organized into the following sections: Overview of Therapeutic Candidate, Therapeutic History, Mechanism of Action, Expected Effect, and Overall Evaluation. Each section draws on information from the available context.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Roflumilast is a fully synthetic small-molecule compound that emerged from extensive medicinal chemistry efforts designed to develop selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4). The development strategy focused on systematically modifying a benzamide scaffold to improve selectivity for PDE4 isoenzymes while reducing binding to the high-affinity rolipram binding site (HARBS), an approach that ultimately improved tolerability over earlier compounds such as rolipram. This process—and the associated chemical optimizations—led to roflumilast’s well-characterized chemical profile as a PDE4 inhibitor. By targeting PDE4 enzymes, roflumilast works to prevent the degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), thereby causing an elevation in intracellular cAMP concentrations. This increase sets off a cascade of downstream reactions that include the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and transcription factors like cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which then modulate immune and inflammatory responses. Over the years, compounds in the PDE4 inhibitor class have been predominantly used for treating chronic inflammatory airway diseases—most notably chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma—by reducing inflammatory cytokine production and improving lung function (Crocetti et al., 2022, pp. 2–4; Page, 2015, pp. 5–6). This strong pharmacological background and well‐defined chemical origin provide a solid foundation for repurposing roflumilast for disorders where inflammation and defective protein clearance, such as IBM, play central roles.

Therapeutic History
Historically, roflumilast has achieved regulatory approval in both Europe and the United States for the maintenance therapy of severe COPD, particularly in patients who experience chronic bronchitis and frequent exacerbations. Although its primary clinical use has been within pulmonary medicine, the biochemical effects of PDE4 inhibition have been demonstrated in various preclinical studies to extend beyond the lungs. For instance, investigations in animal models and cultured human myotubes have revealed that PDE4 inhibitors such as roflumilast can modulate muscle protein turnover. In one study investigating muscle cells derived from patients with COPD cachexia, roflumilast treatment led to significant reductions in markers of proteolysis—specifically through decreased protein ubiquitination and reduced tyrosine release—as well as upregulation of contractile proteins such as myosin heavy chain isoforms (Barreiro et al., 2018, pp. 13–14; Lira et al., 2011, pp. 6–8). Despite these promising findings in muscle-wasting models, no clinical trials have yet been registered that specifically examine roflumilast in the context of IBM or other primary muscle diseases. Searches using terms such as “Roflumilast AND myositis” or “PDE4 inhibitors AND muscle” confirm that the agent’s application in primary inflammatory myopathies remains untested (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Collectively, the historical data indicate that although roflumilast has a proven record in treating COPD through its systemic anti-inflammatory actions, its use in IBM remains a novel and uncharted area that is supported largely by preclinical evidence from related muscle-wasting conditions.

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, the primary mode of action of roflumilast is the selective inhibition of the PDE4 family of enzymes, including isoforms PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D, which are expressed in both immune and structural cells. PDE4 plays an essential role in hydrolyzing cAMP, a second messenger that regulates inflammation, immune cell activation, and intracellular protein degradation pathways. Inhibition of PDE4 by roflumilast leads to sustained elevations in intracellular cAMP levels. This increase activates PKA, which in turn phosphorylates downstream effectors such as CREB. These transcription factors alter gene expression and mediate anti-inflammatory effects—for instance, by reducing the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (Al-Sajee et al., 2019, pp. 3–4). Equally important is the role of cAMP signaling in promoting autophagy, a cellular clearance mechanism critical for eliminating aggregates of misfolded proteins. In skeletal muscle cells, the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of ULK1 has been shown to initiate autophagic processes that help clear toxic protein aggregates, a pathological hallmark observed in IBM (Barreiro et al., 2018, p. 2; Aringer et al., 2024, pp. 3–4). In addition to autophagy, elevated cAMP may enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and upregulate antioxidant defenses through the activation of essential transcription factors, thereby contributing to improved cellular energy metabolism and reducing oxidative stress—a further benefit for muscle contractile function (Herrmann et al., 2022, pp. 3–4; Nio et al., 2017, pp. 6–10). Furthermore, preclinical models have demonstrated that treatment with PDE4 inhibitors reduces the expression of atrogenes (such as atrogin-1 and MuRF-1) and decreases overall muscle proteolysis, thereby preserving the integrity of contractile proteins within skeletal muscle fibers (Lira et al., 2011, pp. 6–8). Thus, the molecular cascade initiated by roflumilast—in which PDE4 inhibition leads to increased cAMP, heightened PKA activity, suppression of NF-κB–mediated cytokine production, and enhanced autophagy—provides a comprehensive mechanistic rationale for its potential therapeutic benefits in inflammatory muscle disorders like IBM (Al-Sajee et al., 2019, pp. 7–8; Spina, 2008, p. 8).

Expected Effect
Based on its molecular pharmacological profile, roflumilast is expected to have several beneficial effects when applied to IBM myotubes. First, the inhibition of PDE4 will result in the accumulation of intracellular cAMP in skeletal muscle cells. The subsequent rise in cAMP levels is anticipated to augment PKA activity, leading to the phosphorylation of downstream substrates such as CREB and ULK1. The phosphorylation of ULK1 is particularly critical, as it initiates autophagosome formation and facilitates the clearance of aggregated proteins. In IBM, where protein aggregation and impaired autophagy are central pathological features, such an effect would likely help in restoring proteostasis (Barreiro et al., 2018, p. 2; Aringer et al., 2024, pp. 7–8).

Second, the increased cAMP/PKA signaling cascade is expected to downregulate the activity of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, thereby reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β. These cytokines are known to exacerbate inflammatory damage and promote muscle degeneration in IBM. By mitigating the release of these mediators, roflumilast could help to alleviate the chronic inflammation that characterizes the disease (Al-Sajee et al., 2019, pp. 7–8; Contreras et al., 2017, pp. 1–2).

Third, the anti-inflammatory and autophagy-inducing effects of roflumilast are also anticipated to impact muscle proteostasis positively. In studies involving COPD cachexia, treatment with roflumilast has been correlated with a reduction in proteolytic markers such as protein ubiquitination and tyrosine release, accompanied by an upregulation of contractile proteins such as myosin heavy chain isoforms (Barreiro et al., 2018, pp. 13–14; Lira et al., 2011, pp. 6–8). These effects would theoretically translate into improved muscle fiber integrity and enhanced contractile performance in IBM myotubes. Additionally, there is preclinical evidence that PDE4 inhibitors can promote mitochondrial biogenesis and reduce oxidative stress, factors that would further support muscle function and potentially mitigate the muscle weakness often seen in IBM (Herrmann et al., 2022, pp. 3–4; Nio et al., 2017, pp. 6–10).

Finally, the overall combined effect of reduced proteolysis, improved autophagic clearance, and dampened inflammatory signaling is expected to create a more favorable cellular environment for muscle regeneration and maintenance. In vitro studies of muscle cells have demonstrated that improvements in these cellular processes correlate with better muscle contractility and enhanced cell survival. Expression analyses in cultured myotubes have confirmed the presence of key components of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway and autophagy regulators, supporting the hypothesis that roflumilast will act effectively in the IBM cellular milieu (Al-Sajee et al., 2019, pp. 4–5; Nio et al., 2017, pp. 4–6).

Overall Evaluation
The repurposing of roflumilast for the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis is supported by a robust mechanistic rationale and encouraging preclinical evidence from related models of muscle wasting and inflammation. One of the principal strengths of roflumilast lies in its well-established clinical safety profile in COPD, where its oral bioavailability and predictable pharmacokinetics have been validated in large randomized clinical trials (Garnock-Jones, 2015, pp. 1–2; de Mey et al., 2011, p. 13). This extensive clinical experience offers a significant regulatory and translational advantage if preliminary efficacy data in muscular models prove to be favorable.

On a mechanistic level, roflumilast’s selective inhibition of PDE4 results in a multi-pronged therapeutic approach that aligns well with the pathogenesis of IBM. By elevating intracellular cAMP levels, roflumilast not only suppresses the NF-κB–mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines but also activates PKA-dependent pathways that promote autophagy through ULK1 phosphorylation. These molecular effects are particularly relevant given that IBM is characterized by chronic inflammation, protein aggregation, and impaired autophagic clearance—all of which contribute to progressive muscle degeneration (Al-Sajee et al., 2019, pp. 7–8; Crocetti et al., 2022, pp. 21–22; Spina, 2008, p. 8). Preclinical data in muscle-wasting conditions further reinforce the notion that PDE4 inhibition can reduce proteolytic markers and enhance the expression of contractile proteins, suggesting that the therapy might translate into improved muscle mass and contractile strength (Barreiro et al., 2018, pp. 13–14; Lira et al., 2011, pp. 6–8).

However, several challenges must be considered. Perhaps the most critical limitation is the lack of direct clinical or preclinical evidence demonstrating roflumilast’s efficacy in IBM. Clinical trial registries show no studies that have directly evaluated PDE4 inhibition in IBM patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Thus, while the mechanistic rationale is compelling, substantial proof-of-concept studies in relevant in vitro and animal models of IBM are needed before translation into the clinic can be seriously considered.

Another potential concern is related to the side-effect profile of PDE4 inhibitors. Although roflumilast is generally well tolerated in COPD populations, its most common adverse events include gastrointestinal disturbances (such as nausea and diarrhea) and weight loss. These side effects could be particularly problematic in an older IBM patient population, which may exhibit heightened sensitivity to such adverse effects (Garnock-Jones, 2015, pp. 11–12; Spina, 2008, p. 8). Additionally, given the complexity of IBM, which involves not only inflammatory processes but also specific patterns of immune cell infiltration, protein aggregation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, it is plausible that PDE4 inhibition might need to be combined with other therapeutic strategies to achieve a meaningful clinical benefit (Crocetti et al., 2022, pp. 21–22; Aringer et al., 2024, pp. 7–8).

Despite these challenges, the overall benefits of roflumilast’s pharmacological profile—namely, its capacity to modulate chronic inflammation, enhance autophagic clearance, and preserve muscle proteostasis—make it a very attractive candidate for repurposing in IBM. The fact that its mechanism of action targets multiple pathogenic pathways suggests potential advantages over therapies that focus on a single aspect of muscle degeneration.

Future research should prioritize rigorous preclinical studies in cellular models that recapitulate the pathological features of IBM. In particular, experiments in cultured IBM myotubes should assess whether roflumilast can indeed elevate cAMP levels sufficiently to activate PKA and induce ULK1-dependent autophagy, as well as whether this translates into a measurable reduction in inflammatory cytokine production (e.g., TNFα and IL-1β) and proteolytic markers. Complementary in vivo studies in animal models of inflammatory myopathy would be essential to evaluate improvements in muscle contractility and overall function. These studies should also address potential adverse effects, with careful attention paid to dosing regimens that balance efficacy with tolerability.

In summary, roflumilast presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in Inclusion Body Myositis based on the following key strengths:

1. Its chemical and pharmacological profile as a selective PDE4 inhibitor is well established, with a clear mechanism that increases intracellular cAMP and subsequently activates PKA. This mechanistic cascade leads to downstream suppression of NF-κB–mediated inflammatory cytokine production and induction of autophagy, both of which are highly relevant to IBM pathology (Al-Sajee et al., 2019, pp. 3–4; Spina, 2008, p. 8).
2. Preclinical studies in muscle-wasting conditions, such as those involving COPD cachexia, have shown that roflumilast can reduce proteolytic markers and upregulate contractile proteins, supporting the hypothesis that its use could preserve muscle mass and improve function in IBM (Barreiro et al., 2018, pp. 13–14; Lira et al., 2011, pp. 6–8).
3. Its long-term clinical use and approval in COPD provide a favorable translational pathway. The established oral dosing and known systemic safety profile are advantageous when considering a repurposing strategy (Garnock-Jones, 2015, pp. 1–2; de Mey et al., 2011, p. 13).

On the other hand, the weaknesses include:

1. The complete absence of direct preclinical or clinical evidence specific to IBM. The critical extrapolation from COPD-related muscle wasting to IBM remains to be empirically validated (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
2. The potential for adverse effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances and weight loss, which may be particularly problematic in the elderly IBM patient population (Garnock-Jones, 2015, pp. 11–12; Spina, 2008, p. 8).
3. The multifactorial nature of IBM, where defective autophagy, chronic inflammation, protein aggregation, and mitochondrial dysfunction all converge, suggests that even if roflumilast addresses some of these pathways, it may require combination with other therapeutic interventions to achieve robust clinical improvement (Crocetti et al., 2022, pp. 21–22; Aringer et al., 2024, pp. 7–8).

Overall, while significant further investigation is warranted, the integrated biochemical, molecular, and preclinical evidence strongly supports the idea that roflumilast could offer therapeutic benefits in IBM. Its ability to elevate cAMP, drive PKA-dependent autophagy induction, suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and favorably modulate muscle proteostasis directly addresses several key aspects of IBM pathobiology. Therefore, roflumilast merits further evaluation in targeted preclinical studies using IBM models, followed by carefully designed early-phase clinical trials if the preliminary results are encouraging (Al-Sajee et al., 2019, pp. 7–8; Crocetti et al., 2022, pp. 21–22; Aringer et al., 2024, pp. 3–4).

In conclusion, roflumilast offers a multifaceted therapeutic approach that, if validated, could significantly impact the progression of Inclusion Body Myositis. The potential to simultaneously modulate autophagy, suppress inflammatory cytokine release, and improve muscle contractile properties is highly compelling. Given the current unmet medical need in IBM and the relative safety of roflumilast as established in COPD populations, pursuing rigorous preclinical investigations and eventual clinical trials is a justified and promising direction for drug development.

Dimethyl Fumarate,"Proposal for Dimethyl Fumarate

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a small-molecule fumaric acid ester originally derived from fumaric acid, a naturally occurring dicarboxylic acid present in various fruits and vegetables, and later synthesized into a pharmaceutically active compound known as Tecfidera® (McGuire et al., 2016). It belongs to the class of fumaric acid esters (FAEs), a group of immunomodulatory and cytoprotective compounds that were initially developed for the treatment of psoriasis and later repurposed for multiple sclerosis (MS) owing to their robust anti‐inflammatory and antioxidant activities (McGuire et al., 2016). DMF is formulated as an oral delayed‐release tablet that, upon ingestion, is rapidly hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract to its primary active metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The chemical synthesis of DMF involves esterifying fumaric acid with methanol under controlled conditions, yielding a compound with an electrophilic α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl system, which enables covalent interactions with specific cysteine residues on target proteins (Albrecht et al., 2012). This structural feature is key to its mechanism of action and places DMF within a broader class of electrophilic immunomodulators that modulate redox‐sensitive signaling pathways (Albrecht et al., 2012).

Therapeutic History:
DMF has a well‐established therapeutic history in dermatological and neurological disorders, having been used for decades in the treatment of psoriasis in Europe before its repurposing for relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) (McGuire et al., 2016). Clinical trials in MS have demonstrated DMF’s efficacy in reducing the frequency of relapses and slowing disease progression while maintaining a favorable safety profile over long‐term administration (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023). Its pharmacological benefits in MS were largely attributed to its dual roles in activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway and inhibiting pro‐inflammatory signaling, mechanisms that provide neuroprotection as well as immunomodulation (Albrecht et al., 2012). Although DMF has not been thoroughly tested in clinical trials specifically targeting Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), several preclinical and early‐stage studies in inflammatory myopathies and muscle models support its potential utility by reducing muscle inflammation and preserving contractile properties (Albrecht et al., 2012; Cantó‐Santos et al., 2023). The drug class to which DMF belongs has a strong precedent in treating conditions characterized by immune dysregulation and oxidative stress, providing a rationale for its repurposing in diseases such as IBM that share common pathophysiological features (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
DMF’s primary mechanism of action centers on the activation of the Nrf2 pathway, which is achieved through covalent modification of cysteine residues on Kelch‐like ECH‐associated protein 1 (Keap1), the cytosolic repressor of Nrf2, leading to Nrf2 stabilization and its subsequent nuclear translocation (McGuire et al., 2016). Once in the nucleus, Nrf2 binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoter regions of a battery of detoxifying and cytoprotective genes, resulting in the upregulation of enzymes such as heme oxygenase‐1 (HO‐1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and various glutathione S‐transferases that collectively enhance cellular antioxidant defenses (Belcher et al., 2017). In addition to Nrf2 activation, DMF exerts immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting NF‐κB signaling, in part through interference with ubiquitin‐dependent processes; specifically, it inhibits TLR‐induced formation of M1 and K63‐linked polyubiquitin chains on key signaling intermediates, thereby reducing NF‐κB nuclear translocation and subsequent pro‐inflammatory cytokine production (McGuire et al., 2016). This inhibition of NF‐κB is achieved by covalently modifying cysteine residues on pivotal proteins involved in the phosphorylation and degradation cascade of IκB, which normally restrains NF‐κB activity (McGuire et al., 2016). Furthermore, DMF’s ability to deplete intracellular glutathione transiently and then promote glutathione recycling contributes to enhanced cellular resistance to oxidative damage, linking its antioxidant capacity to improved proteostasis (Albrecht et al., 2012). In addition to its effects on redox biology and inflammation, DMF’s modulation of immune cell profiles—specifically reducing pro‐inflammatory Th1 and Th17 subsets while promoting regulatory anti‐inflammatory responses—completes its multifaceted mechanism, which is essential for countering the complex pathology observed in IBM (Belcher et al., 2017; Duleh et al., 2016).

Expected Effect:
In the context of Inclusion Body Myositis, the hypothesis posits that by activating the Nrf2 pathway and inhibiting NF‐κB signaling, DMF will reduce oxidative stress and the production of inflammatory cytokines in IBM myotubes, which in turn is expected to improve proteostasis and muscle contractility (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Specifically, the enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes via Nrf2 activation should mitigate the oxidative damage that contributes to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and proteostatic dysregulation within muscle fibers (Albrecht et al., 2012). Moreover, by dampening NF‐κB mediated inflammation, DMF is anticipated to reduce the chronic inflammatory milieu that disrupts normal muscle homeostasis and leads to detrimental muscle fiber degeneration (McGuire et al., 2016). Experimental evidence in muscle disease models has indicated that interventions targeting these pathways can preserve muscle fiber integrity and improve contractility, thereby supporting the expectation that DMF may yield similar benefits in IBM (Cantó‐Santos et al., 2023). In vitro assays using IBM myotubes that assess proteostasis markers, such as the clearance of aggregated proteins and the stabilization of contractile proteins, alongside measurements of cytokine levels and oxidative stress markers, are expected to reveal that DMF treatment results in decreased inflammatory cytokine production and reduction in oxidative stress markers, leading to improved muscle cell function (Albrecht et al., 2012). Additionally, the immunomodulatory effects of DMF, which include the suppression of pro‐inflammatory T cell responses, may further alleviate the immune‐mediated muscle damage that characterizes IBM, as supported by analogous findings in MS models where DMF reduced infiltration of pathogenic immune cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, DMF represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on its established pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and multifaceted mechanism of action that addresses both oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways central to IBM pathology (Albrecht et al., 2012). One of the principal strengths of DMF is its oral delayed‐release formulation, which offers excellent bioavailability and has already been shown to be safe and well tolerated over long‐term use in both MS and psoriasis patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023; Pascale et al., 2020). Furthermore, its dual action—activating the Nrf2 pathway to boost intracellular antioxidant defenses and concurrently inhibiting NF‐κB signaling through selective inhibition of polyubiquitin chain formation—directly targets the two major components of IBM’s pathological cascade: oxidative stress and chronic inflammation (McGuire et al., 2016; Belcher et al., 2017). The mechanistic specificity provided by covalent cysteine modification on Keap1 and on regulatory elements of the NF‐κB pathway suggests that DMF can exert a potent and selective regulatory influence on these cellular processes (Albrecht et al., 2012). Preclinical studies in related inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease models further substantiate the therapeutic potential of DMF by demonstrating reduced inflammatory cytokine production and improved cellular proteostasis (Belcher et al., 2017; Duleh et al., 2016).

However, there are several weaknesses and challenges that need to be addressed. Despite the encouraging mechanistic data, direct preclinical evidence linking DMF to improved muscle proteostasis or increased contractility specifically in IBM models is currently limited (McGuire et al., 2016). Additional studies focused on muscle‐specific endpoints such as muscle fiber regeneration, contractile function, and clearance of aggregated proteins in IBM are essential to translate these cellular effects into functional improvement (Cantó‐Santos et al., 2023; Pascale et al., 2020). Moreover, while the immunomodulatory effects of DMF observed in neuroinflammatory disorders are promising, IBM is a complex disease with both inflammatory and degenerative components that may not respond to immunomodulation alone, highlighting the inherent risk that DMF might only partially address the multifactorial pathology of IBM (Goyal & Mozaffar, 2018). Another potential limitation is the transient glutathione depletion reported with DMF treatment, which although linked to subsequent antioxidant response, could exacerbate acute oxidative stress if not carefully controlled in already compromised muscle tissue (Albrecht et al., 2012). Additionally, the heterogeneity in IBM patient populations means that response to DMF may vary, necessitating robust biomarker development to identify those who are most likely to benefit (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024).

In summary, DMF’s repurposing for IBM is supported by its dual antioxidant and immunomodulatory actions, its established oral bioavailability, and its proven safety in chronic inflammatory conditions such as MS and psoriasis (McGuire et al., 2016; Pascale et al., 2020). Its mechanism—centered on Nrf2 activation and NF‐κB inhibition—directly targets key molecular pathways implicated in IBM, namely oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and proteostasis impairment (Albrecht et al., 2012; Belcher et al., 2017). The expected outcome is a reduction in inflammatory cytokine production, improved clearance of misfolded proteins, and enhanced muscle cell survival and contractility in IBM myotubes (Albrecht et al., 2012; Cantó‐Santos et al., 2023). Nonetheless, the absence of direct clinical or robust preclinical evidence in IBM contexts remains a key obstacle that must be overcome through targeted studies focusing on muscle‐specific endpoints and functional outcomes (Goyal & Mozaffar, 2018; McGuire et al., 2016). Therefore, while DMF is a strong candidate for repurposing, further rigorous investigation using muscle disease models and well‐designed clinical trials is necessary to definitively establish its efficacy, optimal dosing, and long‐term safety in patients with Inclusion Body Myositis (Goyal & Mozaffar, 2018; McGuire et al., 2016).

Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA),"Proposal for Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) is an acyclic polyisoprenoid derivative originally developed and employed as an anti‐ulcer agent in Japan and other Asian countries since the 1980s. Its chemical structure is characterized by a retinoid skeleton, and it belongs to a class of drugs capable of inducing the heat shock response (HSR). In this therapeutic class, small molecules that induce heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been repurposed from their original indications to treat diseases in which proteotoxic stress is a central pathology. GGA’s discovery arose from studies targeting gastric mucosal protection, and its later identification as a potent inducer of HSP70 shifted interest toward its utility in other conditions. The mechanism of heat shock protein induction by GGA has generated significant interest because HSP70 is a key molecular chaperone involved in protein folding, refolding misfolded proteins, and facilitating protein degradation pathways that enable the maintenance of cellular proteostasis. This biochemical property places GGA within a class of drugs that, although originally synthetic and designed for gastroprotection, are now being investigated for their potential to correct cellular protein misfolding disorders such as Inclusion Body Myositis (Zeng et al., 2018; Lanters et al., 2015).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, GGA has been used as an anti‐ulcer drug with a well‐established clinical safety profile over several decades. Its previous uses extend from gastrointestinal protection to various experimental models where its cytoprotective capabilities are linked to HSP induction. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that GGA induces HSP70 expression in several tissues including the brain, heart, liver, and skeletal muscle. For example, studies in rat models have revealed that oral GGA can cause rapid induction of HSP70 in cardiac and neural tissues, conferring protection against ischemia–reperfusion injury and other forms of cellular injury (Fujiki et al., 2006; Zeng et al., 2018). Moreover, preclinical investigations in models of cardiomyopathy and Alzheimer’s disease have shown that GGA’s ability to upregulate HSPs is associated with a reduction in pathological aggregates and improvement in tissue function (Sanbe et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2017). Although there is no direct evidence from clinical trials in IBM—as evidenced by searches on clinical trial registries that have not identified any registered investigations on GGA for IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov)—the literature draws parallels between proteotoxic stress in IBM and other degenerative conditions where GGA has already been probed, thereby supporting its repurposing potential (Spicer, 2018; Nogalska, 2009).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of action of GGA involves the activation of the heat shock transcription factor-1 (HSF1). Under basal conditions, HSF1 is maintained in an inactive state via binding to HSP70; however, GGA disrupts this inhibitory interaction, thereby freeing HSF1 to translocate into the nucleus and bind to heat shock elements (HSEs) in the promoter regions of heat shock protein genes. This results in a coordinated transcriptional upregulation of HSP70 as well as several small heat shock proteins, such as HSP27 (HSPB1) and HSPB8 (Mossiah et al., 2022; Sanbe et al., 2009). The induction of HSP70 plays a critical role by enhancing the cellular capacity to refold misfolded proteins and facilitating the clearance of protein aggregates through interactions with the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy pathways. In models of protein aggregation diseases, HSP70 induction has been correlated with reductions in pathological inclusions such as p62-positive vacuoles, which are a marker of impaired autophagic flux and proteotoxic stress (Spicer, 2018; Nogalska, 2009). Moreover, in cardiomyopathy models, GGA has been shown to also upregulate small HSPs like HSPB8, which directly inhibit amyloid oligomer formation and mitigate apoptosis by interfering with mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activation (Sanbe et al., 2009). A further layer of complexity is provided by evidence that GGA can modulate intracellular signaling pathways such as ERK/p38 MAPK, which have been implicated in both neuronal survival and protein homeostasis, thereby contributing to the clearance of toxic aggregates (Sun et al., 2017). This multi‐faceted mechanism—combining release and activation of HSF1, induction of HSP70 and small HSPs, and subsequent improvements in protein folding capacity and aggregate clearance—forms the biochemical foundation for hypothesizing that GGA may alleviate cellular proteotoxic stress in IBM myotubes (Mossiah et al., 2022; Spicer, 2018).

Expected Effect:
The working hypothesis regarding GGA’s therapeutic potential in IBM is based on its capacity to induce HSP70 upregulation and thereby reduce the burden of misfolded proteins that accumulate in inclusion bodies. In an experimental setting using IBM myotubes, it is expected that treatment with GGA will increase HSP70 levels, as has been observed in various preclinical muscle and cardiac models. The increase in HSP70 should in turn facilitate the refolding of denatured proteins, promote the degradation of irreversibly misfolded proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy, and ultimately reduce the formation or persistence of p62-positive autophagic vacuoles—a key histopathological hallmark of IBM (Spicer, 2018; Nogalska, 2009). In addition, the enhanced proteostasis is anticipated to improve muscle fiber health and thereby potentiate improvements in contractile amplitude. HSP70 and its associated chaperones play a documented role in preserving the integrity of the contractile apparatus, as evidenced by their localization at myofilaments in cardiac tissues following GGA treatment (van Marion et al., 2020; Hoogstra-Berends et al., 2012). Given that similar mechanisms of proteotoxicity and disturbed autophagy are central to the pathogenesis of IBM, it is reasonable to expect that GGA could exert comparable protective effects in skeletal muscle. The anticipated outcome is a multi-pronged cellular benefit: reduced proteotoxic stress due to fewer aggregations of misfolded proteins, diminished p62-positive vacuole accumulation due to improved autophagic clearance, and enhanced muscle contractile function as a result of stabilized sarcomere integrity and improved mitochondrial function (Spicer, 2018; Zeng et al., 2018). Furthermore, the ability of GGA to act via modulation of HSF1 activity and its well-documented safety profile after oral dosing underpin the hypothesis that therapeutic levels of HSP70 can be achieved in myotubes to yield these beneficial effects (Mossiah et al., 2022; Fujiki et al., 2006).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, Geranylgeranylacetone represents a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis, primarily due to its capacity to induce HSP70 and related chaperones, thereby alleviating proteotoxic stress—a central pathogenic feature of IBM. The candidate drug is well distinguished by several strong attributes. First, its class history as an anti‐ulcer agent with decades of clinical safety and oral bioavailability supports its tolerability and feasibility for repurposing (Zeng et al., 2018; Fujiki et al., 2006). Second, preclinical studies in models of cardiomyopathy and neurodegeneration have consistently shown that GGA upregulates HSP70 and small HSPs, leading to reduced protein aggregation, improved cellular survival, and functional recovery in tissues exposed to proteotoxic stress (Sanbe et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2017). Third, the biochemical mechanism—centered on modulating HSF1 activity to promote HSP transcription—has robust support across diverse tissues and disease models, providing a clear rationale for its activity in muscle cells, which are known to express HSP70 abundantly under stress conditions (Spicer, 2018; Mossiah et al., 2022). With respect to the proposed hypothesis that GGA-induced HSP70 upregulation will alleviate proteotoxic stress in IBM myotubes, reduce p62-positive vacuoles, and enhance contractile amplitude, the supporting evidence is encouraging yet largely indirect. While there is substantive evidence from cardiac and neurodegenerative models that HSP induction correlates with reduced protein aggregation and improved cellular function, direct evidence for these effects in IBM or skeletal muscle models remains to be generated (Spicer, 2018; Nogalska, 2009). In this context, a key weakness lies in the absence of targeted preclinical studies explicitly testing GGA’s efficacy in IBM-specific models, including quantitative assessment of p62-positive vacuole diminution and direct measurements of contractile performance. This gap presents an opportunity for rigorous experimental investigation in vitro using IBM patient-derived myotubes as well as in vivo models that recapitulate the proteostasis defects observed in IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Another potential challenge is related to pharmacokinetic considerations. Although GGA has demonstrated good oral bioavailability and systemic distribution in other tissues, the extent to which effective concentrations are achieved and sustained in skeletal muscle tissue of IBM patients will require empirical determination (Wang et al., 2014; van Marion et al., 2020). Additionally, the biochemical specificity of HSP induction may vary across tissue types, and while muscle cells are known to express HSP70 upon stress, the modulation of autophagic pathways (reflected by p62 clearance) and the functional recovery of contractile amplitude will need to be validated in muscle-specific contexts. The candidate’s novelty is supported by the innovative repurposing of a well-known gastroprotective agent into a therapeutic strategy for a largely intractable and debilitating myopathy, which currently lacks effective disease-modifying treatments (Spicer, 2018; Guglielmi et al., 2024).

In conclusion, Geranylgeranylacetone exhibits multiple strengths as a potential therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis. Its established safety profile from decades of clinical use as an anti-ulcer drug, combined with robust preclinical evidence supporting its role in upregulating HSP70 and mitigating proteotoxic stress, underpins its developmental feasibility for IBM. The proposed mechanism of action via HSF1 activation and HSP induction is well documented in the literature and directly addresses key pathological features of IBM, namely the accumulation of misfolded proteins and dysfunctional autophagy marked by p62-positive vacuoles, while also potentially enhancing muscle contractility. However, significant preclinical validation in IBM-specific models is still required to verify the expected molecular and functional outcomes in muscle tissue. Overall, while there remain gaps in direct evidence, the compelling mechanistic rationale and favorable pharmacokinetic and safety attributes of GGA render it a promising candidate for further investigation in the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis (Spicer, 2018; Mossiah et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov).

Trehalose,"Proposal for Trehalose

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Trehalose is a naturally occurring nonreducing disaccharide composed of two glucose molecules linked via an α,α-1,1-glycosidic bond. Originally discovered in lower organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and plants, trehalose functions as an osmolyte and a chemical chaperone, protecting cells from diverse environmental stresses including desiccation, heat, and oxidative stress (Mardones et al., 2016). It has been used extensively as a food additive and pharmaceutical stabilizer due to its high chemical stability and favorable safety profile, as evidenced by its Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status granted by the FDA and European regulators (Khalifeh et al., 2020). Belonging to the class of small-molecule osmolytes that modulate proteostasis, trehalose has attracted considerable attention as a therapeutic candidate for diseases characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation. Its discovery and purification are entirely based on its natural biosynthesis in organisms such as yeast and fungi, rather than through chemical synthesis, which contributes to its low-cost production and ease of repurposing for clinical applications (Kul & Stork, 2024; Maruf et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, trehalose has been investigated in a range of experimental settings spanning neurodegenerative conditions, metabolic diseases, and even some forms of muscular dystrophies. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that trehalose is effective at inducing autophagy, thereby reducing toxic protein aggregates in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Khalifeh et al., 2019; Mustapha et al., 2023). In addition, early-phase clinical studies have explored its safety and tolerability in humans; for instance, clinical trials involving neurodegenerative disorders have reported a good safety profile, with minimal side effects observed even after prolonged administration (Khalifeh et al., 2020; Sahebkar et al., 2021). While trehalose has not been extensively trialed in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) specifically, there have been several clinical investigations wherein trehalose was administered in related myopathic conditions and other protein aggregation disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). Furthermore, its use in a muscle cell model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy demonstrated that trehalose effectively reduced aggregate formation by enhancing autophagic clearance, providing an experimental precedent for its potential use in diseases like IBM that share similar pathological hallmarks (Cicardi, 2016). Such evidence from both neurodegenerative and muscle-directed experiments underscores trehalose’s versatility as a repurposed therapeutic candidate and supports the rationale for advancing it into studies focused on IBM.

Mechanism of Action:
Trehalose exerts its biological effects predominantly by inducing autophagy via an mTOR-independent pathway. One key facet of its mechanism is the inhibition of glucose transport by blocking solute carrier 2A (SLC2A/GLUT) transporters. This competitive inhibition mimics a state of cellular nutrient deprivation, thereby activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) which, in turn, phosphorylates the autophagy initiator ULK1 to trigger autophagosome biogenesis (Mardones et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2019). In parallel, trehalose has been shown to stabilize lysosomal membranes and to induce nuclear translocation of Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), the master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway. TFEB activation leads to the upregulation of genes responsible for lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, facilitating the clearance of aggregated proteins—a mechanism of particular relevance in disorders characterized by proteostatic defects (Jeong et al., 2021; Khalifeh et al., 2020). Moreover, trehalose exhibits chemical chaperone activity by forming a protective glass-like matrix around proteins, thereby minimizing deleterious folding errors and preventing aggregate formation (Khalifeh et al., 2019). Some studies have also suggested that trehalose may promote autophagy through additional pathways including the modulation of endocytosis and lysosomal pH changes, which collectively contribute to an enhanced autophagic flux (Martinon et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2018). These combined mechanisms, including AMPK-ULK1-mediated autophagy induction and TFEB-driven lysosomal enhancement, provide a robust biochemical basis for trehalose’s ability to reduce the cellular burden of misfolded proteins and aggregated inclusions in diseased cells.

Expected Effect:
In the context of Inclusion Body Myositis, the proposed hypothesis is that trehalose will induce autophagy via TFEB nuclear translocation in IBM patient myotubes, leading to enhanced clearance of pathological protein aggregates and restoration of contractile amplitude. IBM myotubes are characterized by the accumulation of intracellular protein inclusions that disrupt normal cellular function and contribute to muscle weakness. By activating TFEB, trehalose is expected to upregulate a suite of autophagy- and lysosome-related genes, thereby facilitating the degradation of these toxic aggregates (Frapporti, 2023; Khalifeh et al., 2020). In vitro assays using IBM patient-derived myotubes should show a reduction in protein inclusions and improvement in markers of autophagic flux, such as increased LC3-II conversion and decreased levels of p62, which serve as proxies for active autophagy (Mustapha et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2019). Additionally, it is anticipated that the clearance of aggregates correlates with improved muscle fiber contractility and overall cellular function, thereby potentially reversing the biomechanical impairments observed in IBM (Cicardi, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a). The expected efficacy in protein aggregate clearance is further supported by data from neurodegenerative models where trehalose administration led to behavioral improvements paralleled by reduced pathological aggregation, which, by analogy, could translate to functional improvements in IBM skeletal muscle (Holler et al., 2016; Khalifeh et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
Trehalose presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis due to several compelling attributes. First, its natural origin and widespread use as a food additive confer an excellent safety profile, which is crucial for repurposing efforts in chronic diseases (Khalifeh et al., 2020; Martinon et al., 2020). Its dual mechanism—functioning both as an osmolyte to stabilize proteins and as a potent inducer of autophagy via AMPK/ULK1 activation and TFEB nuclear translocation—addresses the core pathological features of IBM, namely proteostasis imbalance and impaired aggregate clearance (Jeong et al., 2021; Mardones et al., 2016). Multiple preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing protein inclusions in models of neurodegeneration and muscle diseases, and although direct clinical trials in IBM are currently sparse, emerging data from related myopathies and neurodegenerative conditions provide strong inferential support for its mechanism (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-b; Jaber et al., 2025; Sahebkar et al., 2021).

Strengths of trehalose include its proven capacity to induce autophagy via mTOR-independent pathways, a mechanism that bypasses some of the adverse effects associated with classical mTOR inhibitors, and its ability to activate TFEB, which plays a pivotal role in lysosomal biogenesis and cellular recycling. This multifaceted mode of action is advantageous in tackling the diverse pathological cascades encountered in IBM, where muscle fibers accumulate various toxic aggregates that impair cellular contractility (Frapporti, 2023; Khalifeh et al., 2019). Developmental feasibility is high given trehalose’s status as a food-grade compound with established ADME characteristics and tolerability in preclinical animal models, alongside encouraging early results from clinical investigations in neurodegenerative diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a; Mustapha et al., 2023).

However, certain weaknesses must be acknowledged. One notable limitation of trehalose is its relatively poor bioavailability when administered orally due to rapid metabolism by trehalase enzymes in the intestine and kidney, which may necessitate the use of alternative formulations or delivery systems, such as trehalose-bearing nanocarriers, to achieve therapeutic concentrations in muscle tissue (Jaber, 2024; Jeong et al., 2021). Additionally, while the mechanistic rationale is strong, direct clinical evidence in IBM remains limited and further rigorous preclinical studies using IBM patient-derived myotubes, as well as eventual controlled clinical trials, are required to validate its efficacy and dosing regimen in this specific context (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a; Jaber, 2024; Mustapha et al., 2023). Furthermore, variability in autophagic responses between different cell types and disease stages could affect therapeutic outcomes, necessitating careful stratification of patient populations and optimization of treatment timing (Khalifeh et al., 2020; Mustapha et al., 2023).

In conclusion, trehalose stands out as a highly attractive drug candidate for repurposing in Inclusion Body Myositis. Its natural derivation, well-established safety profile, and multifactorial mechanism of action—emphasizing both the stabilization of protein homeostasis and the induction of autophagy through TFEB activation—position it favorably for further investigation. While the current evidence supports its potential to clear pathological protein aggregates in IBM myotubes and restore contractile function, challenges in bioavailability and the current lack of direct clinical trial data in IBM must be addressed through further preclinical studies and optimized delivery strategies. Overall, the strengths of trehalose, particularly its mechanistic specificity and developmental feasibility, outweigh its weaknesses, making it a promising candidate to advance in our drug development pipeline for Inclusion Body Myositis (Khalifeh et al., 2019; Martinon et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.-a).

MCC950,"Proposal for MCC950

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MCC950 is a synthetic small molecule that was discovered during medicinal chemistry efforts targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome. It belongs to the diaryl sulfonylurea class of compounds, a structural subclass originally exemplified by glyburide, which was later repurposed and optimized for high potency and selectivity against NLRP3. The compound is typically synthesized via multi‐step organic synthesis procedures involving diaryl sulfonylurea motifs, with chemical modifications designed to optimize binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3. Its discovery was driven by the need to block IL-1β maturation in inflammatory diseases through direct inhibition of inflammasome assembly. As a chemical scaffold, MCC950 represents the archetype of small molecule NLRP3 inhibitors that have been extensively used as both mechanistic probes in vitro and potential therapeutic agents in in vivo disease models (Coll et al., 2015; Coll et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
MCC950 has a robust preclinical history and has been evaluated in a wide range of inflammatory models. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that MCC950 effectively prevents excessive IL-1β and IL-18 secretion by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation in models of multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, and other inflammatory conditions. In various animal models, including those of muscle inflammation, MCC950 has shown efficacy in reducing pyroptosis and limiting tissue damage. Its pharmacokinetic profile, including oral bioavailability and a reasonable half-life, has supported its transition into early-phase clinical studies as a potential anti-inflammatory agent. Although MCC950 has been primarily evaluated for conditions such as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes and neuroinflammatory disorders, there is emerging evidence from rodent studies that pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 can ameliorate muscle inflammatory pathology. Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is characterized by chronic muscle inflammation and degenerative changes, and the rationale here is that by repurposing MCC950, it may be possible to directly dampen inflammasome‐driven IL-1β maturation, thereby improving muscle proteostasis and contractility. Yet, direct evaluation of MCC950 in IBM models remains limited; however, the compound’s demonstrated efficacy in analogous models and its effect on muscle function in rodents position it as a promising candidate for adaptation in IBM (Coll et al., 2015; Toldo & Abbate, 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, MCC950 exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by specifically binding to the NACHT domain of the NLRP3 protein. This binding appears to occur in close proximity to the ATP-binding Walker B motif, thereby blocking ATPase activity which is critical for the oligomerization and activation of NLRP3. By inhibiting the nucleotide‐dependent conformational changes required for inflammasome assembly, MCC950 prevents the downstream recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC as well as caspase-1 activation. This blockage stops the processing of pro-IL-1β into its active form, IL-1β, and similarly prevents maturation of IL-18. Detailed biochemical studies have confirmed that MCC950 does not interfere with other inflammasomes such as NLRP1, NLRC4, or AIM2, pointing to its robust selectivity for the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, mechanistic studies using photoaffinity labeling and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assays have demonstrated the direct engagement of MCC950 with the NLRP3 NACHT domain in both active and inactive conformational states. This mechanism is unique in that MCC950 essentially “locks” NLRP3 in a closed, inactive conformation, thereby inhibiting the cascade of inflammatory events (Coll et al., 2019; Vande Walle et al., 2019; El-Sayed et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the expected effect of MCC950 in an IBM setting would be the reduction of IL-1β maturation in affected myotubes, which in turn is anticipated to diminish downstream inflammasome-mediated processes such as caspase-1 activation and pyroptotic cell death. In vitro experiments using IBM myotubes should show that MCC950 reduces inflammatory cytokine release while preserving or restoring normal proteostasis. Consequently, with reduced caspase-1 activity, there would be a concomitant stabilization of the proteins that form the sarcomere, leading to improved contractile function and muscle strength. Evidence from preclinical rodent studies in inflammatory muscle models indicates that NLRP3 inhibition can lead to decreased pyroptosis and enhanced muscle force generation. Additionally, since NLRP3 is expressed in multiple cell types including muscle cells, inhibiting its activity in IBM-affected tissue is expected to result in a dramatic reduction in the chronic inflammatory milieu that characterizes the disease (Coll et al., 2015; Toldo & Abbate, 2024; Nizami et al., 2021). The hypothesis is that by dampening the inflammatory cascade, MCC950 could correct contractile deficits by preserving the structural and functional integrity of the myofibrils.

Overall Evaluation:
MCC950 presents as a compelling therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on its highly specific inhibitory action on the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key driver of IL-1β and IL-18 maturation. Its strong mechanistic rationale is bolstered by extensive biochemical studies demonstrating direct binding to the NACHT domain, thereby preventing inflammasome assembly and subsequent inflammatory signaling. This selectivity is a significant strength because it minimizes off-target effects and preserves other essential immune functions, an important consideration in a chronic disease setting like IBM (Coll et al., 2019; Vande Walle et al., 2019).

The therapeutic history of MCC950, with its demonstrated efficacy in multiple preclinical inflammatory models and acceptable safety profiles in early-phase clinical studies, further supports its potential for repurposing in IBM. While it has not yet been directly applied to IBM, analogous studies in muscle inflammation models and related conditions provide a strong foundation for its clinical exploration in this context. Moreover, the fact that MCC950 is orally bioavailable and synthetically tractable makes it an attractive candidate from a drug development and formulation standpoint (Coll et al., 2015; Kaur et al., 2025).

On the molecular level, the detailed understanding of MCC950’s mode of action—specifically targeting the ATPase activity of NLRP3 and preventing ASC oligomerization—defines its potential to abate the inflammation-driven proteostasis disruption observed in IBM. The hypothesis that inhibition of NLRP3-mediated caspase-1 activation could preserve sarcomeric integrity and improve contractility is well supported by preclinical evidence in other models of inflammatory myopathy and cardiac dysfunction (Coll et al., 2019; Toldo & Abbate, 2024).

However, a key weakness lies in the fact that MCC950 has not been directly validated in IBM-specific models; much of the current evidence is extrapolated from studies in neuroinflammatory, cardiovascular, and generalized muscle inflammation contexts. Additionally, there are some warnings from studies in genetic inflammatory disorders (such as CAPS) where certain NLRP3 mutations render MCC950 less effective or ineffective; although IBM predominantly involves wild-type NLRP3 activation, this factor must be considered when extrapolating preclinical results (Vande Walle et al., 2019; Coll et al., 2019).

In conclusion, the strengths of MCC950—the established selectivity for NLRP3, the robust mechanistic data indicating its ability to inhibit critical inflammatory pathways, its oral bioavailability, and supportive preclinical evidence in related inflammatory conditions—strongly support further investigation of its potential in Inclusion Body Myositis. The compound’s ability to block IL-1β maturation and reduce caspase-1–driven proteostatic disruption offers a promising therapeutic strategy to improve muscle contractility and slow disease progression in IBM. Nonetheless, further studies focusing on IBM-specific in vitro and in vivo models are essential to fully validate its efficacy and safety profile in this unique muscle pathology. Overall, MCC950 represents a novel and mechanistically precise approach to targeting inflammasome-driven inflammation and may provide a first-in-class therapeutic option for treating the unmet clinical need in IBM (Perera et al., 2018; Tanase et al., 2023; Krishnan et al., 2019).

Tofacitinib,"Proposal for Tofacitinib

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate –
Tofacitinib is an orally available, synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor that belongs to the group of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Initially discovered and developed by screening chemical libraries (notably by Pfizer as documented in earlier studies), tofacitinib was designed as an ATP‐competitive inhibitor that preferentially targets JAK1 and JAK3, while also exhibiting partial activity against JAK2 and TYK2. This compound falls under the broader class of kinase inhibitors and is recognized for its capacity to modulate intracellular cytokine receptor signaling through interrupting the JAK/STAT pathway. JAK inhibitors as a class have found widespread use in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, most notably rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other immune‐mediated diseases. Tofacitinib, marketed as Xeljanz®, has rapidly become a benchmark compound within this class due to its well‐characterized pharmacokinetics, established human safety profile, and demonstrated efficacy in controlling inflammatory processes in disorders where cytokine signaling plays a pivotal role (Tanaka & Yamaoka, 2013).

Therapeutic History –
Tofacitinib’s journey from bench to bedside underscores its robust therapeutic history. It has been extensively studied and approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis, where its anti‐inflammatory properties have been validated through multiple randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trials. As a drug class, JAK inhibitors have been successfully repurposed for several inflammatory diseases such as psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and even refractory dermatomyositis. In particular, open‐label pilot studies in patients with refractory dermatomyositis have demonstrated that tofacitinib leads to significant decreases in interferon‐regulated chemokines and improvements in disease activity measures (Paik et al., 2021). Despite its widespread use in these conditions, there is currently limited clinical trial data directly supporting its use in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). Nevertheless, some searches on ClinicalTrials.gov reveal emerging interest in investigating JAK inhibitors including tofacitinib in IBM or related inflammatory myopathies (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022), suggesting that the drug’s promising profile in autoimmune diseases has naturally led researchers to explore its repurposing for IBM.

Mechanism of Action –
The molecular mechanism of action of tofacitinib is well‐delineated in the literature. Tofacitinib acts as a reversible, ATP‐competitive inhibitor of JAK enzymes, with preferential inhibition of the JAK1 and JAK3 isoforms (Tanaka & Yamaoka, 2013; Krishnaswami, Hodge, & Kawabata, 2016). By binding to the catalytic domain of these kinases, it prevents phosphorylation events that are critical for the activation and dimerization of STAT transcription factors. Once phosphorylated, STAT proteins normally translocate to the nucleus to drive gene transcription of numerous cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Through inhibition of this signaling cascade, tofacitinib effectively suppresses the response to type I interferons as well as other pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin‐6, interleukin‐2, and interferon‐gamma—all of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBM (Tanaka & Yamaoka, 2013; Traves et al., 2021). In biochemical and cellular studies, the compound has demonstrated an 80–95% inhibition of key cytokine pathways shortly after dosing, underscoring its potent immunomodulatory effects. Furthermore, by reducing STAT phosphorylation, tofacitinib indirectly impacts downstream pathways such as nuclear factor‐kappa B (NF-κB), which is known to play a central role in muscle atrophy and the inflammatory response (Krishnaswami et al., 2016). The JAK/STAT axis is particularly relevant in muscle biology; for instance, type I interferon signaling has been associated with inflammatory myopathies, and its downregulation is considered beneficial in reducing chronic muscle inflammation and catabolic processes (Hou et al., 2021).

Expected Effect –
Based on the central hypothesis, the expected effect of tofacitinib in an IBM therapeutic context is to suppress the deleterious inflammatory milieu observed in IBM muscle. IBM is characterized by a prominent type I interferon signature and chronic inflammation that leads to NF-κB activation, muscle atrophy gene expression, and impaired muscle regeneration. Preclinical studies in various myopathy models—albeit not directly in IBM—have shown that JAK inhibition can restore muscle function, improve calcium handling, and reduce atrophy (Oliver, 2022). Specifically, in myotube co-culture systems exposed to interferon-beta (IFNβ), selective inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway has been demonstrated to restore proper calcium handling, a key determinant of contractile performance in muscle cells. By inhibiting JAK1/3, tofacitinib is expected to decrease phosphorylation of STAT proteins and subsequently reduce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes that drive muscle catabolism and inflammation. In IBM muscle, such suppression would theoretically reduce NF-κB activation, leading to decreased expression of muscle atrophy-associated genes, and ultimately improve contractile performance. Gene expression analyses in IBM tissues have repeatedly shown upregulation of interferon-related transcripts and other markers of immune activation that are sensitive to JAK inhibition (Hou et al., 2021). Moreover, prior clinical observations in refractory dermatomyositis patients have established that tofacitinib can downregulate interferon-regulated chemokines such as CXCL9 and CXCL10 (Paik et al., 2021), providing further emphasis on its immunomodulatory potential. Hence, in the proposed assay involving IBM myotubes, the anticipated outcome would be a robust decrease in inflammatory signaling, a normalization of atrophy gene expression, and measurable improvement in contractile parameters, thereby making tofacitinib a promising candidate for repurposing in IBM.

Overall Evaluation –
Tofacitinib emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on several strengths. First, its established human safety profile and extensive clinical use in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory myopathies provide a significant translational advantage (Tanaka & Yamaoka, 2013; Paik et al., 2021). The oral route of administration and well-documented pharmacokinetics make it an attractive option for chronic diseases such as IBM. Second, the compound’s mechanism of action—which involves reversible, ATP-competitive inhibition of JAK1 and JAK3—directly targets the inflammatory signaling cascades that are implicated in IBM pathogenesis. By attenuating type I interferon signaling and downstream NF-κB activation, tofacitinib is expected to provide both anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic effects in muscle tissues, potentially ameliorating muscle atrophy and improving contractile performance (Krishnaswami et al., 2016; Traves et al., 2021).

However, there are also notable weaknesses and challenges. Despite promising mechanistic rationales supported by a robust preclinical literature base, direct clinical evidence of tofacitinib’s efficacy in IBM remains limited. The existing clinical trials to date have primarily focused on rheumatoid arthritis and dermatomyositis, with IBM patients either excluded or not specifically studied (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022). Moreover, IBM encompasses a complex interplay of inflammatory and degenerative processes, and while cytokine signaling is a central feature, the degenerative component (including protein aggregation and inclusion body formation) may not be fully addressed by a drug that primarily modulates immune-mediated pathways. There also remains a degree of uncertainty regarding the long-term effects of JAK inhibition on muscle regeneration, as chronic suppression of cytokine signaling might interfere with normal repair mechanisms under some circumstances (Hou et al., 2021). In addition, while preclinical data in models of rheumatoid sarcopenia and tissue-engineered human skeletal muscle suggest improvements in muscle contractility with tofacitinib treatment (Oliver, 2022), these findings need to be replicated and validated in IBM-specific models before definitive conclusions regarding its efficacy in IBM can be drawn.

In summary, the strengths of tofacitinib include its robust safety record in humans, orally bioavailable formulation, well-characterized JAK1/3 inhibitory mechanism, and evidence from related inflammatory myopathies that supports its potential to suppress deleterious cytokine signaling. These points provide a strong rationale for its repurposing as a novel therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis, particularly in the context of reducing type I interferon signaling and improving muscle contractility by counteracting NF-κB–mediated atrophy. On the other hand, the absence of direct clinical data in IBM, uncertainties regarding its long-term impact on muscle regeneration, and the multifactorial nature of IBM pathology serve as important weaknesses that warrant cautious optimism and further investigation. Overall, based on the current biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature, tofacitinib stands as a promising candidate that merits further preclinical validation in IBM-specific models and eventually carefully designed clinical trials to assess its therapeutic potential in ameliorating muscle atrophy and improving contractile function in patients with Inclusion Body Myositis (Paik et al., 2021; Hou et al., 2021; Traves et al., 2021).

Fasudil,"Proposal for Fasudil

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fasudil is a fully synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor developed as a Rho‐kinase (ROCK) inhibitor. Chemically, it is an isoquinoline sulfonamide derivative—often chemically described as hexahydro-1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-1H-1,4-diazepine—that was initially discovered for its potent vasodilatory and cerebrovascular effects. Its synthesis involves modifications such as those on the homopiperazine ring and sulfonamide linkage, which are critical for its binding specificity to the ATP‐binding pocket of ROCK enzymes (Unknown Reference, 2014; Logé et al., 2003). Fasudil belongs to the class of synthetic ROCK inhibitors, a compound class that has been widely utilized in both preclinical and clinical settings mainly for cardiovascular and neurological indications. The established precedent for this class is that they modulate the actin cytoskeleton, smooth muscle contractility, and inflammatory responses by inhibiting ROCK‐mediated phosphorylation processes. This synthetic origin and extensive medicinal chemistry development have rendered fasudil a highly reproducible and well‐characterized therapeutic candidate appropriate for potential repurposing in other conditions such as Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) (Chen et al., 2013; Liao et al., 2007).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, fasudil has gained regulatory approval in Japan for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage, and it is also approved for other vascular indications such as pulmonary hypertension and stable angina pectoris. Its clinical use over the past two decades has provided extensive human safety and pharmacokinetic data both under intravenous administration and, more recently, via oral formulations in early‐phase trials (Wolff et al., 2024; Lai & Frishman, 2005). In animal models of neuromuscular disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), ROCK inhibition with fasudil has been shown to reduce fibrosis and improve muscle strength through the attenuation of fibro‐adipogenic progenitor cell activation, offering a strong proof‐of‐concept for its utility in modulating muscle pathology (Fernández‐Simón et al., 2021; Unknown Reference, 2014). Nonetheless, no direct clinical or preclinical studies have yet focused on applying fasudil to Inclusion Body Myositis or similar inflammatory myopathies. While its established use has been in vascular and central nervous system diseases, the underlying mechanism—modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and inflammation—provides a sound rationale for exploration in IBM, a disease characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and cytoskeletal abnormalities in muscle tissue (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Takata et al., 2013).

Mechanism of Action:
Fasudil exerts its pharmacological effects primarily by inhibiting the activity of both ROCK1 and ROCK2 isoforms. These serine/threonine kinases are downstream effectors of the small GTPase RhoA and are critical regulators of actin cytoskeleton organization. Fasudil acts as an ATP‐competitive inhibitor, binding specifically to the conserved kinase domain of ROCK and thereby blocking the phosphorylation of several downstream substrates such as myosin light chain (MLC) and the myosin‐binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (MYPT1). This inhibition translates into reduced smooth muscle contraction, decreased formation of stress fibers, and a lowered inflammatory response mediated in part by NF-κB signaling (Chen et al., 2013; Shi & Wei, 2013). Beyond its effect on the contractile apparatus, fasudil’s inhibition of ROCK results in modulation of cytokine production and reduction in the recruitment of inflammatory cells, processes that are particularly relevant in muscle inflammation. Moreover, studies have detailed that fasudil can decrease the expression of fibrogenic signals such as TGF-β1 and collagen deposition, leading to attenuation of fibrosis in various tissues (Fernández-Simón et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2011). At the molecular level, modifications to structural moieties of fasudil—such as its isoquinoline ring—are critical to its binding affinity, and analogs that improve selectivity (e.g., H-1152P) underscore the drug’s capacity to modulate both cytoskeletal dynamics and inflammatory cascades (Chen et al., 2013; Logé et al., 2003).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism, the hypothesis for repurposing fasudil in Inclusion Body Myositis is that by inhibiting ROCK, fasudil will enhance myotube contractility, improve cytoskeletal organization, and reduce inflammatory cell infiltration in diseased muscle tissue. In experimental dystrophic models, ROCK inhibitors have been shown to improve muscle force generation and reduce depositions of fibrotic collagen (Fernández‐Simón et al., 2021; Boyce-Rustay et al., 2010). Given that the contractile machinery in muscle fibers is highly dependent on proper actin filament organization and the integrity of the cytoskeleton, fasudil’s action in reducing aberrant phosphorylation of myosin light chain and restoring balanced cytoskeletal dynamics is anticipated to improve myotube contractility. Additionally, ROCK signaling has been implicated in the regulation of inflammatory cytokine production and immune cell migration, meaning that fasudil could potentially mitigate the inflammatory milieu observed in IBM muscle tissue (Takata et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2013). Importantly, the expression of ROCK has been documented in skeletal muscle cells, and its dysregulation may contribute to the impaired contractility seen in IBM; thus, dampening its activity is expected to restore physiological function (Chen et al., 2013; Liao et al., 2007).

Overall Evaluation:
Fasudil presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in Inclusion Body Myositis due to several notable strengths. First, its synthetic origin and extensive chemical derivation have resulted in a molecule with a well‐understood structure‐activity relationship and reproducible pharmacokinetic profile (Unknown Reference, 2014; Logé et al., 2003). Second, its established clinical use in cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases confirms a high degree of human tolerability and safety, with robust pharmacokinetic data supporting both intravenous and emerging oral formulations (Wolff et al., 2024; Unknown Reference, 2009). Third, fasudil’s mechanism of action—targeting both cytoskeletal organization and inflammatory pathways through ROCK inhibition—addresses two fundamental pathological features of IBM: cytoskeletal disarray and chronic inflammation. The inhibition of ROCK‐mediated phosphorylation directly impacts muscle cell contractility and the deposition of extracellular matrix components, potentially reducing fibrosis and improving overall muscle function (Chen et al., 2013; Fernández-Simón et al., 2021). Fourth, preclinical data from dystrophic and ischemic models provide promising evidence that ROCK inhibition can ameliorate muscle pathology, even though direct studies in IBM have not been conducted. This mechanistic extrapolation is supported by improvements in muscle strength and reduction in fibrosis in DMD models treated with fasudil (Fernández-Simón et al., 2021; Takata et al., 2013).

Despite these strengths, several weaknesses and limitations must be considered. Foremost is the lack of direct preclinical or clinical evidence regarding fasudil’s efficacy in IBM or myositis‐related conditions. While data from cardiovascular and dystrophic models are encouraging, the translation to IBM remains hypothetical without targeted in vivo or in vitro studies in IBM muscle tissue (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chen et al., 2013). Another potential limitation is the non‐selectivity of fasudil for ROCK isoforms; since ROCK2 expression is particularly high in skeletal muscle and neuronal tissues, more isoform‐selective inhibitors might offer a more tailored therapeutic profile with fewer off‐target effects (Chen et al., 2013; Liao et al., 2007). Additionally, while the human safety profile of fasudil is well‐established in other indications, there exists a need for detailed pharmacodynamic studies to determine its optimal dosing, route of administration, and potential long‐term effects specifically in myositis patients (Wolff et al., 2024; Unknown Reference, 2009). Finally, the potential for off‐target inhibition of related kinases at higher concentrations may lead to unintended effects, necessitating careful dose optimization and possibly warranting the exploration of next‐generation analogs or prodrug formulations to limit systemic side effects (Chen et al., 2013; Al-Hilal et al., 2021).

In summary, the repurposing of fasudil for Inclusion Body Myositis is scientifically grounded in its well‐documented mechanism of ROCK inhibition, modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, and anti‐inflammatory properties. Its robust clinical safety record in vascular and cerebrovascular applications, combined with encouraging preclinical data in dystrophic conditions, provides a strong rationale for further investigation. However, direct evidence in IBM models is currently absent, and additional preclinical studies will be critical to assess its efficacy and optimal dosing strategies in muscle‐specific contexts. Overall, fasudil is a promising therapeutic candidate that warrants immediate and comprehensive investigation into its potential to enhance myotube contractility, improve cytoskeletal organization, and reduce inflammatory infiltration in IBM, thereby possibly alleviating the progressive muscle weakness characteristic of this disease (Takata et al., 2013; Fernández-Simón et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2013; Wolff et al., 2024; Liao et al., 2007).

BGP-15,"Proposal for BGP-15

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
BGP-15 is a small molecule, chemically defined as a hydroximic acid derivative of nicotinic acid–amidoxime. It belongs to the class of compounds known as HSP co-inducers, which function by modulating the heat shock response pathway. In particular, BGP-15 is known to facilitate the induction of heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) via activation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and to inhibit poly(AD-ribose) polymerase (PARP), thereby mitigating oxidative stress. This dual mechanism places BGP-15 in a unique category of molecules that combine chaperone co-induction with PARP inhibitory activity. The molecule was initially discovered through efforts to develop novel insulin sensitizers and has subsequently been studied for its cytoprotective actions in several models of metabolic and muscle disease (Campelj et al., 2020; Pető et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
BGP-15 has been the focus of extensive preclinical studies across a spectrum of diseases. In the realm of metabolic diseases, it has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients, with early-phase clinical trials demonstrating a favorable safety profile (Pető et al., 2020). Preclinical evidence in various muscle disease models, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy and critical illness myopathy, demonstrates that BGP-15 improves skeletal muscle function. For example, studies in dystrophic mdx mouse models and diaphragm dysfunction models have shown that BGP-15 ameliorates muscle atrophy and improves contractile force by inducing HSP72 and ameliorating proteostasis imbalance (Campelj et al., 2020; Akkad, 2018). Moreover, its PARP inhibition has been shown to reduce oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are common pathological features in many muscle-wasting conditions. Although direct studies in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) are limited, the therapeutic mechanisms underlying its benefit in other muscle pathologies—particularly those related to mitochondrial integrity and proteostasis—provide a strong rationale for repurposing BGP-15 for IBM (Pető et al., 2020; Cacciani et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
BGP-15 exerts its effect through a dual mechanism. First, it acts as a co-inducer of heat shock proteins, particularly HSP72. The induction of HSP72 is achieved by facilitating the activation and prolonged binding of HSF1 to the heat shock element (HSE), thus triggering a transcriptional response that increases HSP72 levels. HSP72 plays a critical role in maintaining cellular proteostasis by assisting in the proper protein folding, preventing misfolding and aggregation, and facilitating the refolding or removal of damaged proteins (Campelj et al., 2020; Henstridge et al., 2014). In muscle cells, increased HSP72 supports the structural integrity of contractile proteins and improves mitochondrial function through enhanced protein quality control. Second, BGP-15 inhibits PARP1, an enzyme that responds to DNA damage by consuming NAD+ and ATP, leading to energy depletion and cell death under conditions of oxidative stress. By blocking excessive PARP activation, BGP-15 preserves cellular energy stores and helps maintain mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Campelj et al., 2020; Katalin, 2019). This dual activity—simultaneous upregulation of HSP72 and inhibition of PARP—leads to an overall reduction in oxidative stress and improved mitochondrial function, which are the biochemical foundations for improving cellular proteostasis and muscle contractile function.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis driving the repurposing of BGP-15 for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is that its dual capacity to induce HSP72 and inhibit PARP will restore proper proteostasis, reduce the accumulation of protein aggregates, and normalize muscle contractility in IBM myotubes. In IBM, inefficient protein folding and accumulation of aggregated proteins contribute to muscle weakness and degeneration. It is expected that by increasing HSP72 levels, BGP-15 will enhance the folding capacity of muscle cells and promote the clearance of misfolded proteins, thereby mitigating proteotoxic stress (Cacciani et al., 2020). Moreover, by inhibiting PARP, BGP-15 is anticipated to limit excessive NAD+ consumption and oxidative damage, thus preserving mitochondrial integrity and function. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of IBM, where altered energy production and increased ROS contribute to muscle fiber damage. The expected outcome is an improvement in mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory efficiency, leading to enhanced ATP production and reduced oxidative stress, which in turn should result in normalized contractile performance in IBM myotubes. Experimental assays measuring the expression of HSP72, the activity of PARP, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS levels, and contractile parameters in myotubes derived from IBM patients would be key to validating this mechanism (Campelj et al., 2020; Pető et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
BGP-15 presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on its well-documented ability to modulate key biochemical pathways implicated in muscle degeneration. Its dual mechanism of HSP72 induction and PARP inhibition addresses both proteostasis disruption and mitochondrial dysfunction—the two major pathological features in IBM. The strengths of BGP-15 include its oral bioavailability, micromolar potency, and established safety profile from Phase II trials in metabolic diseases, which support its feasibility as a repurposed drug for IBM (Pető et al., 2020). Furthermore, its demonstrated efficacy in preclinical muscle disease models, such as dystrophic and critical illness myopathy models, suggests that similar benefits may extend to IBM, given the common molecular signatures of oxidative stress and impaired protein homeostasis observed in these conditions (Campelj et al., 2020; Cacciani et al., 2020).

However, potential weaknesses include the limited direct evidence of efficacy in IBM-specific models. Most studies available focus on other muscle pathologies, and the translation of these benefits to IBM remains hypothetical. Additionally, the complex pathophysiology of IBM—which encompasses not only proteostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction but also significant inflammatory and degenerative components—raises the possibility that BGP-15’s benefits might be partial if used as monotherapy. There is also the challenge of ensuring that the induction of HSP72 does not inadvertently interfere with other cellular stress responses in a disease that already features an overactive unfolded protein response. Finally, while the dual mechanism is a significant strength conceptually, the precise dosing regimen and long-term safety profile in the context of a chronic degenerative disease like IBM require further elucidation through dedicated preclinical studies and subsequent clinical trials (Campelj et al., 2020; Penke et al., 2018).

In summary, BGP-15’s ability to enhance HSP72 levels and inhibit PARP suggests a powerful mechanism to reduce oxidative damage and improve proteostasis, which are central to the pathogenesis of Inclusion Body Myositis. With favorable safety data from metabolic disease studies and promising results in other muscle disease models, BGP-15 offers a novel, dual-targeted approach that merits further investigation. Success in this area could lead to a significant therapeutic advance for a disease that currently lacks effective treatments. Strategic preclinical studies in IBM-relevant cell models and subsequent clinical trials will be essential to fully define its therapeutic potential and to overcome challenges related to the multifactorial nature of IBM pathology (Campelj et al., 2020; Thakur et al., 2018).

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of selinexor as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM).","Proposal for Selinexor

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of selinexor as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Selinexor is a fully synthetic, first‐in‐class small molecule designed to inhibit nuclear export selectively. Its discovery emerged from rational drug design efforts that were based on a detailed understanding of nucleocytoplasmic transport processes. In particular, extensive medicinal chemistry optimization led to the synthesis of selinexor as a representative of the Selective Inhibitors of Nuclear Export (SINE) compounds. These molecules were engineered to target exportin 1 (XPO1), also known as chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1), the primary receptor that transports proteins and RNAs bearing leucine‐rich nuclear export signals (NES) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Selinexor was designed to covalently bind to the Cys528 residue located within the cargo‐binding groove of exportin 1, thereby irreversibly (yet slowly reversibly) impairing its function. This high degree of specificity arises from its ability to disrupt the interaction between XPO1 and its cargo proteins without broadly affecting other cellular transport machinery. Because the binding to Cys528 directly prevents NES‐bearing proteins from being recognized and exported, selinexor achieves a selective functional blockade that was previously attempted using natural product inhibitors such as leptomycin B but with significantly improved safety and oral bioavailability profiles (Alhalabi et al., 2025; Ben‐Barouch & Kuruvilla, 2020). In contrast to natural products, selinexor is a completely synthetic molecule whose chemical structure was optimized to have favorable pharmacokinetics, including oral absorption and a defined volume of distribution that supports systemic exposure. Its development, originally oriented toward oncology applications, now underpins a repurposing strategy for diseases characterized by abnormal protein localization, such as IBM. In addition, the chemical optimization of selinexor has ensured that it is not only potent in blocking XPO1‐mediated export but also suitable for extended dosing regimens, which may be required in chronic, nonmalignant conditions (Bader et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History
Selinexor has an extensive history of evaluation in oncology, reflecting its role as a potent inhibitor of nuclear export used to restore the nuclear functions of tumor suppressor proteins. Initial preclinical work demonstrated that by trapping proteins such as p53, p21, and other growth regulators in the nucleus, selinexor is capable of reactivating pathways that lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. This mechanism provided the rationale for its development as an anticancer agent for diseases such as relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM), diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and even acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Ben‐Barouch & Kuruvilla, 2020; Syed, 2019). Several phase I and II clinical trials have established not only its efficacy but also a detailed pharmacokinetic and safety profile when administered orally. In addition to its application in hematologic malignancies, selinexor has been investigated in various solid tumors, where disruption of nuclear export was deemed a viable strategy to combat drug resistance. Interestingly, although selinexor was originally developed for oncology, a growing body of literature has considered whether therapeutic agents that interfere with nucleocytoplasmic transport may have benefits in treating diseases involving protein aggregation. Clinical trial searches using terms such as “Selinexor OR Xpovio OR XPO1 inhibitor AND (Inclusion Body Myositis OR muscle disease OR TDP‐43)” reveal increasing interest in exploring XPO1 inhibitors in conditions characterized by mislocalization of proteins, including IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although no clinical trials have definitively established selinexor’s efficacy in neuromuscular disorders to date, the robust anticancer experience with this compound provides a strong foundation for repurposing investigations. Moreover, in veterinary research, related SINE compounds have been used in animal models—most notably in canine lymphoma—to validate the broader therapeutic potential of nuclear export inhibitors (Kosyna & Depping, 2018). As such, selinexor’s therapeutic history is anchored in its well‐documented use in modulating nuclear export and suggests that similar mechanistic benefits may apply if the nuclear retention of key RNA‐binding proteins can be restored in muscles affected by IBM (Syed, 2019).

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, the principal mechanism of action of selinexor is the inhibition of XPO1‐mediated nuclear export. Under normal conditions, XPO1 recognizes and binds to proteins containing NES sequences, facilitating their translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via a Ran‐GTP‐dependent mechanism. Selinexor exploits a critical vulnerability in this pathway by binding specifically to the Cys528 residue found within the cargo‐binding groove of XPO1. By forming a covalent bond with this residue, selinexor effectively blocks the interaction between XPO1 and its cargo proteins, rendering the export process inactive (Ben‐Barouch & Kuruvilla, 2020; Bader et al., 2021). The resulting nuclear retention of multiple proteins has been shown to restore the function of tumor suppressor proteins in cancer cells.

In addition to its role in cancer, a key aspect of the repurposing hypothesis for IBM centers on the regulation of TDP‐43 localization. TDP‐43 is an RNA‐binding protein that normally resides in the nucleus where it plays an important role in RNA splicing and metabolism. In diseases such as IBM, there is aberrant nuclear export of TDP‐43 leading to its cytoplasmic accumulation and aggregation. This abnormal distribution is correlated with proteostatic disturbances, which in turn compromise muscle fiber function. Preclinical studies under conditions of mild oxidative stress have elucidated that TDP‐43 nuclear export is in part mediated by XPO1, since treatment with XPO1 inhibitors such as KPT‐185 has been shown to block the cytoplasmic relocalization of TDP‐43 in neuronal models (Marcus, 2021). Thus, by inhibiting XPO1, selinexor is expected to promote the nuclear retention of TDP‐43 and other similarly exported RNA‐binding proteins.

The biochemistry is highly specific because the interaction between selinexor and XPO1 is mediated by the modification of a single critical amino acid residue. This action not only prevents cargo binding but also partially inactivates the ability of XPO1 to engage with its collection of more than 200 proteins and RNAs. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that the inhibition of nuclear export by selinexor leads to a cascade of downstream effects such as cell cycle arrest and the activation of apoptosis, indicating that the nuclear retention of regulatory proteins has profound functional consequences. In the context of muscle cells, such modulation may re‐establish a balance in proteostasis by (a) enhancing the nuclear function of RNA‐processing factors like TDP‐43, (b) indirectly stimulating autophagic pathways due to the reduction in cytoplasmic aggregates, and (c) restoring normal cellular metabolism that has been disrupted by protein aggregation (Parvaz, 2024). Additionally, the detailed kinetic profile described in preclinical studies suggests that the inhibition of XPO1 is dose‐dependent, and the covalent but slowly reversible binding allows for sustained inhibition with potential for modulation over time (Ben‐Barouch & Kuruvilla, 2020). The overall specificity of selinexor’s mechanism—in which only proteins destined for export via XPO1 are affected—makes it an attractive candidate for diseases in which mislocalization of specific proteins, such as TDP‐43, contributes to pathology.

Expected Effect
The central hypothesis driving repurposing of selinexor in IBM is that inhibition of XPO1 will lead to the nuclear retention of TDP‐43 and, as a consequence, reduce its otherwise pathological accumulation in the cytoplasm. IBM is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration associated with both inflammatory and degenerative pathways, the latter of which includes the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions composed largely of mislocalized RNA‐binding proteins like TDP‐43. The expected therapeutic effect is that by preventing the nuclear export of TDP‐43, selinexor will help re‐establish normal nuclear functions in muscle cells. This, in turn, should reduce the proteostatic stress resulting from the abnormal aggregation of TDP‐43 in the cytosol and thereby support the recovery of proper protein synthesis and degradation pathways.

In an in vitro assay employing IBM myotubes, treatment with selinexor is expected to yield several measurable outcomes. First, immunofluorescence microscopy should demonstrate that TDP‐43—and likely other RNA‐binding proteins subject to XPO1‐mediated export—is redistributed from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Biochemical fractionation assays may reveal a corresponding decrease in the insoluble aggregate forms of TDP‐43 with an increase in its soluble nuclear counterpart. Additionally, markers of improved proteostasis, such as enhanced chaperone activity and upregulated autophagic flux, might be observed as downstream consequences of restoring nuclear retention. Finally, functional assays of muscle contractility could indicate improvements in parameters such as myotube contraction amplitude or endurance, reflecting the benefits of normalized protein homeostasis and improved cellular metabolism in muscle fibers (Marcus, 2021; Bader et al., 2021).

Moreover, selinexor’s favorable pharmacokinetic profile, as detailed in several studies, is supportive of its ability to achieve adequate tissue concentrations in muscle. Oral administration results in measurable plasma concentrations that translate into systemic exposure levels, with a volume of distribution that indicates penetration into extravascular compartments, including skeletal muscle (Bader et al., 2021). This tissue penetration is crucial because any therapeutic effect in IBM must be mediated by the drug reaching affected muscle fibers at concentrations sufficient to inhibit XPO1 consistently over a dosing interval. Preclinical animal models evaluated for anticancer activity with selinexor have demonstrated that sustained dosing can maintain inhibitory concentrations in multiple tissues; although similar studies in muscle are limited, the underlying pharmacokinetic parameters are promising for the context of a chronic neuromuscular disease.

The expected molecular mechanism in muscle would follow a logic analogous to that demonstrated in cancer and neuronal models: when oxidative or other stress conditions drive abnormal nuclear export of TDP‐43, administration of selinexor would rapidly inhibit XPO1 activity and prevent further export. With repeated dosing, the cumulative effect should be a restored equilibrium wherein the majority of TDP‐43 is maintained within the nucleus, thereby reducing its cytoplasmic toxic accumulation and enabling proteostasis. Ultimately, the normalization of TDP‐43 distribution is anticipated to lead to improved muscle cell metabolism, reduced aggregate‐driven toxicity, and enhanced contractile function—key therapeutic endpoints in IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Marcus, 2021).

Overall Evaluation
Based on the data and literature reviewed, selinexor appears to be a promising candidate for repurposing as a disease‐modifying therapy for Inclusion Body Myositis. Its well‐characterized synthetic origins and the robust mechanistic rationale provided by its action as a selective inhibitor of XPO1 offer a strong foundation for this hypothesis. The major strengths and weaknesses of selinexor in this context are discussed below.

Strengths
1. Established Synthetic Origin and Mechanistic Specificity:
Selinexor is entirely synthetic and has been optimized through rational drug design for selective inhibition of nuclear export by targeting the Cys528 residue of XPO1. This specificity means that the effect of the compound is directly linked to the modulation of the nuclear export pathway without broadly compromising cellular function outside of this route (Alhalabi et al., 2025; Ben‐Barouch & Kuruvilla, 2020). In IBM, where mislocalization of TDP‐43 plays a central pathological role, such targeted intervention is highly attractive. The detailed biochemical understanding of XPO1’s binding properties supports the notion that a similar inhibitory mechanism in muscle cells could correct abnormal protein distribution.

2. Broad Therapeutic History and Clinical Experience:
The extensive preclinical and clinical evaluations of selinexor in oncology provide a well‐documented safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profile. Its successful use in relapsed and refractory hematologic malignancies demonstrates that sufficient systemic exposure can be achieved via oral dosing (Syed, 2019; Ben‐Barouch & Kuruvilla, 2020; Garzon et al., 2017). Although selinexor has not yet been directly applied to IBM in clinical practice, the repurposing rationale is supported by similar pathomechanisms of protein mislocalization observed in both oncology and neurodegenerative conditions. The fact that related XPO1 inhibitors have been explored in varied species—including in veterinary settings—points to a potential translational breadth that could be harnessed for IBM.

3. Mechanistic Rationale Targeting a Core Pathological Process:
A central aspect of IBM pathology is the aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP‐43, which disrupts normal RNA metabolism and proteostasis. By blocking the nuclear export of TDP‐43 via inhibition of XPO1, selinexor may restore the proper nuclear pool of this RNA‐binding protein, thus re‐establishing the normal regulation of splicing and mRNA processing in muscle fibers. This intervention has been indirectly validated in neuronal models in which XPO1 inhibition reduced TDP‐43 cytoplasmic aggregation and improved cell viability under stress conditions (Marcus, 2021). Therefore, the proposed mechanism in muscle is not only plausible but also grounded in prior biochemical observations.

4. Favorable Pharmacokinetic Profile and Feasibility of Repurposing:
Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that selinexor is orally bioavailable with a relatively predictable plasma half‐life, and its extensive tissue distribution suggests that therapeutic concentrations are achievable in peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle (Bader et al., 2021). This aspect is critical for any treatment aimed at IBM, a disease where targeting the affected muscle tissue is essential. Moreover, since selinexor is already approved for clinical use in oncology, the repurposing pathway may be streamlined with an abundance of existing clinical data available to guide dose‐finding and safety assessments in a new patient population.

Weaknesses and Challenges
1. Limited Direct Evidence in Muscle‐Specific Models:
Despite the compelling theoretical rationale, direct experimental evidence demonstrating the efficacy of selinexor in muscle‐specific models of IBM is currently lacking. Most mechanistic and pharmacokinetic data come from oncology and neuronal studies. There is a pressing need for targeted preclinical studies in IBM animal models or cultured human myotubes to directly assess whether XPO1 inhibition by selinexor can correct TDP‐43 mislocalization and improve muscle function (Nakayama et al., 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). These studies would be critical to validate the translatability of the oncologic and neurodegenerative paradigms to the context of a muscular dystrophy.

2. Potential Adverse Effects and Safety Concerns:
In clinical trials for cancer, selinexor has been associated with several adverse events including gastrointestinal toxicity, hematological suppression, and fatigue. IBM predominantly affects older individuals, who may be more susceptible to such side effects. Any repurposing effort would require rigorous dose optimization to ensure that the doses used to achieve meaningful effects on nuclear export in muscle do not elicit intolerable toxicity in a vulnerable population. This balance between efficacy and tolerability will need to be carefully studied in early‐phase clinical trials specifically designed for neuromuscular patients (Syed, 2019; Kosyna & Depping, 2018).

3. Complexity of Nuclear Export Regulation in Muscle Cells:
While XPO1 is a central mediator of nuclear export in many cell types, the regulation of this process can vary with cellular context. Muscle cells may possess unique or redundant nuclear export mechanisms that are not as prominent in cancer cells. If the nuclear export of TDP‐43 in muscle fibers is governed in part by alternate pathways, then inhibiting XPO1 alone may not be sufficient to restore normal protein localization. Understanding the full complement of nucleocytoplasmic transport regulation in muscle tissue will be critical for predicting the therapeutic efficacy of selinexor in IBM (Kosyna & Depping, 2018).

4. Translational Considerations When Repurposing an Oncology Agent:
Even though selinexor’s pharmacokinetics and safety have been characterized in oncology patients, the translation of these findings to IBM is not straightforward. The chronic, slowly progressive nature of IBM differs markedly from the rapidly evolving oncologic conditions for which selinexor was developed. Consequently, long‐term dosing regimens may need to be modified, and the impact of cumulative toxicity must be re‐assessed. The differences in disease pathophysiology, patient demographics, and treatment duration between cancer and IBM could complicate the clinical development pathway for this repurposing effort.

Expected Therapeutic Outcome and Future Directions
In the proposed therapeutic model, administration of selinexor in IBM would primarily aim to redistribute TDP‐43 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in affected myotubes. Based on available evidence, it is expected that inhibition of XPO1 will lead to reduced formation of cytoplasmic TDP‐43 aggregates, which are implicated in disrupting RNA metabolic processes and impairing proteostasis. Improved nuclear retention of TDP‐43 would in theory restore normal pathways of mRNA splicing and transcriptional regulation. As a downstream effect, muscle fibers could recover some degree of normal function, reflected in increased contractile capacity and decreased cellular stress. Preclinical assays should focus on documenting the subcellular localization of TDP‐43 via immunofluorescence, quantifying soluble versus aggregated protein pools using biochemical fractionation, and ultimately assessing improvements in muscle fiber contractility in vitro (Marcus, 2021; Bader et al., 2021).

In addition, future studies should establish biomarkers that can reliably indicate target engagement in muscle tissue. For example, a reduction in cytoplasmic TDP‐43 levels or an increase in nuclear retention might serve as surrogate markers for efficacy. Animal models that recapitulate IBM pathology will also be essential. These would enable detailed pharmacodynamic studies to define the optimal dosing regimen that maximizes target engagement in muscle while minimizing systemic toxicity. Given the already extensive clinical experience with selinexor in oncology, dose‐escalation studies in an IBM setting could build on known pharmacokinetic parameters such as half‐life, systemic clearance, and volume of distribution (Bader et al., 2021).

Another future direction involves exploring combination therapies. It is possible that the effects of selinexor could be amplified when used alongside other treatments that modulate proteostasis, such as enhancers of autophagy or chaperone inducers. Such combination approaches might achieve a more complete correction of the cellular abnormalities seen in IBM, achieving synergy between mechanisms that restore nuclear homeostasis and those that promote the clearance of existing protein aggregates. This strategy may be particularly relevant if alternative nuclear export pathways in muscle cells limit the efficacy of selinexor when used as a monotherapy.

Overall Evaluation
In summary, selinexor represents a highly promising candidate for repurposing as a disease‐modifying therapy in the context of Inclusion Body Myositis. Its mechanism—selective inhibition of XPO1‐mediated nuclear export—directly addresses a core pathological feature of IBM, namely the mislocalization and aggregation of TDP‐43 and potentially other RNA‐binding proteins. The synthetic origin and rigorous chemical optimization of selinexor provide confidence in its specificity and pharmacokinetic behavior, which have been well characterized in oncology settings (Alhalabi et al., 2025; Ben‐Barouch & Kuruvilla, 2020). Moreover, extensive clinical and preclinical investigations in cancer have generated substantial data on its efficacy, tolerability, and tissue distribution, all of which are encouraging for repurposing efforts.

Strengths of using selinexor include its robust mechanistic rationale, supported by evidence that XPO1 plays a pivotal role in the nuclear export of TDP‐43 under stress conditions (Marcus, 2021). The compound’s well‐defined pharmacokinetic parameters and oral bioavailability further bolster its candidacy, ensuring that therapeutic concentrations can be achieved in skeletal muscle. Additionally, the overall clinical experience with selinexor as an anticancer agent provides a substantial foundation for dose optimization and safety assessments in a new clinical setting.

However, significant challenges persist. The current lack of direct evidence in muscle‐specific preclinical models means that further targeted research is necessary to validate the expected correction of TDP‐43 trafficking in IBM myotubes. The potential toxicity of selinexor in a patient population that tends to be older and more frail than oncologic cohorts poses another concern that must be carefully addressed through dose titration studies. Finally, the inherent complexity of nucleocytoplasmic transport regulation in muscle cells may require a more nuanced understanding of whether XPO1 inhibition alone will suffice or if compensatory mechanisms might undermine the therapeutic efficacy of selinexor.

In light of these considerations, the repurposing of selinexor for IBM is scientifically compelling and worthy of further investigation. It is recommended that a series of rigorous preclinical studies be undertaken using human muscle cell models and animal models of IBM pathology to evaluate tissue‐specific pharmacodynamics, confirm the nuclear re‐localization of TDP‐43, and assess improvements in muscle function. Additionally, it will be critical to establish appropriate biomarkers that can signal effective target engagement in muscle tissue during subsequent clinical studies. Overall, selinexor’s established clinical track record in oncology, combined with its precise and specific mode of action, supports further exploratory studies that could ultimately pave the way for its use as a novel therapeutic approach in IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kosyna & Depping, 2018).

Conclusion
In conclusion, the comprehensive literature review suggests that selinexor holds significant promise for repurposing as a therapy for Inclusion Body Myositis. Its synthetic origin, optimized pharmacokinetics, and selective mechanism of blocking XPO1‐mediated nuclear export provide a strong scientific rationale for its use in restoring the normal nuclear localization of TDP‐43 and other RNA‐binding proteins. This, in turn, could correct critical proteostatic disturbances in IBM myotubes and improve muscle contractility. While the majority of existing data comes from cancer and neurodegenerative models, the parallels in nuclear export dysfunction provide a credible basis for extending the application of selinexor to IBM. Nonetheless, the challenges related to tissue‐specific pharmacodynamics, safety in an older and more vulnerable population, and potential compensatory pathways in muscle require detailed preclinical and translational research. The convergence of biochemical, clinical, and pharmacokinetic data makes selinexor an attractive candidate that justifies further investigation in rigorously designed studies. As our understanding of the molecular pathology of IBM advances, it is anticipated that targeting nucleocytoplasmic transport will emerge as a critical strategy in treating this debilitating disease. Given the inherent strengths and acknowledged limitations of selinexor, a methodical approach that begins with preclinical muscle models and leverages existing clinical experience in oncology is warranted. Through these steps, the potential for selinexor to provide a disease‐modifying treatment for Inclusion Body Myositis can be fully evaluated, with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes in a condition where current treatment options remain largely palliative (Bader et al., 2021; Syed, 2019).

In summary, selinexor’s well‐documented mechanism of action, favorable systemic exposure properties, and broad clinical validation in oncology strongly support its further development as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for IBM. Rigorous preclinical and translational studies are essential to confirm that the nuclear export inhibition achieved by selinexor in muscle cells translates into meaningful clinical benefits, including restored proteostasis and improved contractile function in affected myotubes.

Sulforaphane,"Proposal for Sulforaphane

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sulforaphane (SFN) is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate that is bioactive and derived from cruciferous vegetables, with broccoli, broccoli sprouts, cabbage, and kale being the primary sources. It is formed from the glucosinolate precursor glucoraphanin through the enzymatic activity of myrosinase, which exists in plant tissues and in the human gut microbiome. This compound belongs to the broader class of phytochemicals known as isothiocyanates, which have long been associated with chemopreventive and antioxidant activities. Historically, SFN was first characterized for its anticancer properties, as epidemiological studies supported an inverse correlation between the consumption of cruciferous vegetables and cancer incidence. Accordingly, SFN has been developed as a nutraceutical and is widely recognized for its ability to stimulate cellular defense mechanisms through the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. The interest in SFN has grown in the context of repurposing existing compounds with known safety profiles for new therapeutic indications; its natural occurrence, low toxicity at dietary doses, and oral bioavailability make it a promising candidate for a repurposing strategy. The class of compounds that SFN represents has been extensively used in both preventive nutritional strategies and as a component in preclinical studies targeting diseases characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation (Liebman & Le, 2021; Cardozo et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Sulforaphane’s therapeutic history spans numerous preclinical studies that have leveraged its capacity to induce phase II detoxification enzymes and enhance antioxidant responses. In cancer chemoprevention, SFN has shown common benefits by upregulating detoxification and antioxidant enzymes via Nrf2 activation, thus reducing the risk of various carcinogen-induced processes. Beyond oncology, SFN has also been implicated in neuroprotective strategies, improving mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress in models of neurodegeneration such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. Preclinical models in muscle biology have demonstrated that SFN can alleviate muscular dystrophy‐related pathologies by reducing oxidative stress and upregulating Nrf2-dependent gene expression. For example, studies in dystrophic muscle models reveal that SFN administration can reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, improve proteostasis, and enhance muscle function, suggesting that its mechanisms extend beyond cancer and into the realm of muscle disorders. Although direct clinical trials on Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) using SFN are lacking—as confirmed by several searches on ClinicalTrials.gov—the broad preclinical evidence in muscle atrophy and other protein aggregation diseases (such as seen in models of exercise-induced muscle damage and age-associated muscle dysfunction) supports the hypothesis that SFN might prove beneficial for IBM. SFN’s long record in both nutritional intervention and experimental medicine, combined with its history of safe use in human dietary studies, provides a strong basis for considering it for repurposing in IBM, a disease that shares mechanistic features with other muscle pathologies where SFN has already demonstrated efficacy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Bose et al., 2020; Ruhee & Suzuki, 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of SFN is its potent activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is bound in the cytosol by its inhibitory partner Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1), which facilitates its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. SFN acts as an electrophile that covalently modifies specific reactive cysteine residues on Keap1, particularly Cys-151 among other critical sites, thereby disrupting the Keap1-Nrf2 complex. This modification prevents the degradation of Nrf2, permitting its stabilization and subsequent nuclear translocation. Once within the nucleus, Nrf2 binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. This leads to the upregulation of a suite of cytoprotective genes, including phase II detoxification enzymes such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis. These enzymes collectively bolster the cell’s antioxidant capacity, reduce the burden of reactive oxygen species, and facilitate the restoration of redox homeostasis. Additionally, SFN has been shown to promote proteostasis by enhancing the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagic clearance mechanisms through the upregulation of heat shock proteins such as Hsp27. Upregulation of proteasome activity is particularly important in the context of pathologies that feature the accumulation of misfolded or aggregated proteins, as it ensures that damaged proteins are efficiently degraded and removed from the cell. In muscle models, where oxidative stress can promote protein aggregation and impair contractility, such proteostatic mechanisms are essential for maintaining muscle cell health. At the molecular level, SFN’s actions extend further by modulating additional signaling pathways including AMPK, Akt/Foxo, and mTOR, which are involved in cellular metabolism, growth, and autophagy regulation. Taken together, the biochemical interactions of SFN—its covalent modification of Keap1, subsequent activation of Nrf2, induction of antioxidant and proteostasis-related genes, and secondary effects on metabolic pathways—provide a comprehensive mechanistic rationale for its use in diseases characterized by oxidative stress and protein aggregation, such as IBM (Ruhee et al., 2025; Bose et al., 2020; Cardozo et al., 2021; Ruhee & Suzuki, 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed experimental assay using IBM myotubes, the expectation is that SFN will activate Nrf2 and drive the expression of its downstream target genes involved in antioxidant defense and proteostasis. Activation of Nrf2 will lead to increased transcription and subsequent translation of detoxifying enzymes such as NQO1, HO-1, and glutathione-related enzymes, which together will enhance the muscle cell’s capacity to neutralize excess ROS. This reduction in oxidative stress is critical because oxidative damage is known to potentiate the formation of protein aggregates—a hallmark of IBM pathology. By mitigating oxidative stress, SFN is expected to decrease the formation and accumulation of such aggregates within muscle fibers, thereby alleviating one of the central disease mechanisms in IBM. Moreover, in muscle atrophy models, SFN has been observed to promote improvements in muscle fiber integrity and contractile performance. The enhancement of contractile performance is hypothesized to result not only from the reduction in toxic aggregate burden but also from improved mitochondrial function and energy metabolism as a result of reduced oxidative damage. In addition, SFN-induced upregulation of proteasome activity and autophagy, as evidenced by increased expression of chaperones like Hsp27, is anticipated to facilitate the clearance of misfolded proteins. This proteostatic boost is particularly significant in IBM, where impaired protein turnover directly contributes to muscle weakness and degeneration. Therefore, in IBM myotubes, SFN is predicted to enhance overall cellular protein quality control, promote a healthier redox state, and ultimately improve the contractile properties and viability of muscle cells. This multi-pronged effect—centered on antioxidant upregulation, improved proteostasis, and better mitochondrial function—aligns closely with the hypothesis that SFN’s Nrf2-mediated actions can counteract the pathological features of IBM (Alattar et al., 2022; Bose et al., 2020; Ruhee & Suzuki, 2020; Zhang et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Sulforaphane emerges as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis through its multifaceted actions on the Nrf2 pathway. One of the major strengths of SFN is its well-documented ability to boost cellular antioxidant defenses by directly modifying Keap1, thus ensuring the activation and stabilization of Nrf2. This, in turn, leads to the upregulation of a broad array of cytoprotective genes, resulting in enhanced detoxification, improved redox balance, and stimulated proteostasis. Readers should note that the same mechanisms that protect against carcinogenesis in nutritional models have now been observed in muscle atrophy and oxidative stress environments; this cross-tissue applicability underscores the therapeutic versatility of SFN. Another strength is the excellent human safety profile and oral bioavailability of SFN, which has been confirmed in numerous dietary studies and clinical evaluations in other conditions. These attributes facilitate easier translation from preclinical findings to clinical applications, reducing the time and cost typically associated with early-phase drug development. Furthermore, the capacity of SFN to modulate secondary signaling pathways such as AMPK, Akt/Foxo, and mTOR provides additional rationale for its beneficial effects on muscle metabolism and contractile performance. It is anticipated that by reducing ROS-mediated damage and promoting efficient proteostatic clearance, SFN can reduce the formation of toxic protein aggregates—a key pathogenic feature in IBM—thereby preserving muscle function and potentially improving clinical outcomes.

However, there are also potential challenges and weaknesses in deploying SFN as a therapeutic for IBM. Despite robust preclinical evidence, direct clinical data supporting the use of SFN in IBM are sparse. Although several searches on ClinicalTrials.gov indicate that no clinical trials have been registered directly linking SFN with IBM, the absence of such data necessitates careful validation in preclinical IBM models before moving to human studies. Moreover, while SFN has been shown to be effective in reducing oxidative stress and improving muscle function in models of muscular dystrophy and age-related muscle dysfunction, IBM presents a complex pathophysiological landscape involving not only oxidative stress and aggregation but also profound inflammatory and immune-mediated components. Thus, while SFN’s antioxidant and proteostatic mechanisms may address part of the disease process, they may not fully target the immunological aspects of IBM pathology, which might require combination therapies. Another concern is related to the potential for sustained Nrf2 activation to become maladaptive over chronic treatment courses. Although acute and intermittent activation of Nrf2 is beneficial, there are reports in other tissues of potential reductive stress or even paradoxical adverse effects when Nrf2 is overactivated continuously. Therefore, careful dosing, monitoring, and possibly intermittent dosing regimens of SFN would be necessary in a clinical context to avoid such complications. Finally, while SFN’s natural origin is an advantage in terms of safety and public acceptance, its pharmacokinetic variability, influenced by factors such as dietary preparation and individual differences in gut microbiota activity, could potentially lead to inconsistent therapeutic levels among patients.

Overall, sulforaphane represents a strong candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent in IBM. Its mechanism of activating Nrf2 through Keap1 cysteine modification leads to a cascade of cytoprotective, proteostatic, and anti-inflammatory effects that are highly relevant to the pathogenesis of IBM. Preclinical data in muscle models of oxidative stress and atrophy support the hypothesis that SFN could reduce aggregate formation and improve muscle contractile performance. However, rigorous preclinical studies using dedicated IBM models are needed to validate these findings and to determine optimal dosing regimens. In parallel, early-phase clinical trials would be crucial to assess SFN’s efficacy and safety specifically in IBM patients. Given its natural origin, established safety profile, and multifaceted pharmacodynamics, SFN offers a compelling multi-targeted approach to bolster endogenous antioxidative and proteostatic defenses in IBM, although it may need to be combined with other agents to address the full spectrum of the disease’s pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Bose et al., 2020; Cardozo et al., 2021; Ruhee & Suzuki, 2020; Ruhee et al., 2025; Liebman & Le, 2021).

In conclusion, evaluating the candidate sulforaphane brings forth a persuasive scientific rationale based on its natural origin, mechanism of action via Nrf2 activation, and historical use in models of oxidative stress and muscle dysfunction. Its ability to improve cellular antioxidant defenses, enhance proteasome activity, and stimulate autophagy holds significant promise for addressing the key pathogenic features of Inclusion Body Myositis—namely oxidative stress–driven protein aggregation and compromised muscle function. While current clinical evidence in IBM is limited, preclinical studies in related muscle and aging models provide encouraging data. The next steps in validating SFN for IBM should include comprehensive preclinical investigations using IBM-specific cellular and animal models, followed by carefully designed clinical trials to establish efficacy and safety in human patients. With these additional studies, sulforaphane could become a vital component of a novel therapeutic strategy that leverages endogenous cellular defense mechanisms to counteract the degenerative processes seen in IBM (Alattar et al., 2022; Ruhee & Suzuki, 2020; Bose et al., 2020; Cardozo et al., 2021).

Anle138b,"Proposal for Anle138b

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Anle138b is a synthetic small‐molecule compound that belongs to the diphenyl‐pyrazole (DPP) derivative class. It was discovered through high-throughput screening approaches—specifically, scanning for intensely fluorescent targets (SIFT)—and then optimized medicinally for efficacy against pathological oligomer formation (Wagner et al., 2013; Deeg et al., 2015). Chemically, its structure is defined as 3-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-5-(3-bromophenyl)-1H-pyrazole, and this design enables it to cross biological barriers including the blood–brain barrier. Compounds in this chemical class have been broadly utilized as aggregation inhibitors in neurodegenerative conditions to interfere with toxic oligomeric species rather than targeting monomeric proteins or mature fibrils (Wagner et al., 2013; Gillman, 2015). The compound’s synthesis involves modular chemical modifications that enhance hydrophobic interactions with oligomer interfaces, and its intrinsic fluorescence properties further enable direct molecular binding studies (Wagner et al., 2013). Overall, Anle138b is representative of a new generation of targeted therapies aimed at modulating protein aggregation—a mechanism relevant not only to central nervous system disorders but also, as hypothesized here, to neuromuscular diseases such as Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Anle138b has been extensively studied in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly those characterized by pathogenic protein aggregation. Preclinical studies have shown that this oligomer modulator can inhibit the progression of diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy (MSA), tauopathies, and prion diseases by targeting toxic oligomeric species (Wagner et al., 2013; Heras-Garvin et al., 2019). In animal models, administration of Anle138b has resulted in reduced aggregation of alpha-synuclein, decreased neurodegeneration, improved motor performance, and delayed disease progression even when the treatment was initiated after onset of pathology (Heras-Garvin et al., 2019; Gillman, 2015). Clinical trials such as NCT04208152 and NCT04685265, conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with Parkinson's disease, have further evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability of Anle138b, establishing a favorable safety profile and oral bioavailability (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020). Despite this robust work in neurodegeneration, there is no direct evidence in the current literature of Anle138b being used to treat myopathies or Inclusion Body Myositis specifically; however, its mechanism of inhibiting oligomerization is mechanistically relevant to IBM because IBM muscle fibers display pathological protein aggregates, including TDP-43 and β-amyloid, which contribute to degeneration (Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014; Guglielmi et al., 2024). The therapeutic history of the compound provides precedent for its repurposing into new indications where protein misfolding and aggregation are central pathogenic features.

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of action of Anle138b involves binding to hydrophobic interfaces present in pathogenic protein oligomers. Detailed biochemical studies have demonstrated that it interacts preferentially with aggregated forms of proteins such as alpha-synuclein, tau, and beta-amyloid, without affecting the normal monomeric species (Wagner et al., 2013; Carolina, 2020). This selective binding disrupts the normal aggregation pathway, thereby inhibiting the formation of toxic oligomer species. The compound achieves this by engaging at the hydrophobic oligomer interface, which is crucial in maintaining the structure of these toxic assemblies (Wagner et al., 2013). Experimental studies have shown that such modulation not only prevents further aggregation but can also facilitate a remodeling of existing aggregates into non-toxic, smaller species (Wagner et al., 2015). Additional mechanistic insights provided by recent bioinformatics and structural studies indicate that Anle138b may have pleiotropic effects, including potential modulation of intracellular pathways such as cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory signaling cascades, although its primary effect remains its direct interaction with oligomeric proteins (Hosseini-Gerami et al., 2023; Hosseini-Gerami, 2022). The compound’s mode of action is especially relevant for proteins like TDP-43 and β-amyloid, which have been implicated in the pathology of Inclusion Body Myositis; TDP-43 aggregation is a hallmark of IBM pathology and its inhibition could lead to preservation of cellular structure and function (Sidoryk-Węgrzynowicz et al., 2024; Guerrero-Muñoz et al., 2014). Such molecular interactions suggest that Anle138b operates via a direct and structure-dependent mechanism to modulate oligomer assembly, thereby reducing aggregate-driven toxicity.

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing Anle138b in IBM is that it will inhibit the oligomerization of misfolded proteins, particularly TDP-43 and β-amyloid, within IBM myotubes. IBM is characterized by the accumulation of these proteins leading to sarcomere disruption and impaired contractility (Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014; Guglielmi et al., 2024). In vitro studies in other contexts have demonstrated that Anle138b reduces protein aggregation, and the expectation is that similar effects will be observed in muscle cells. Specifically, by preventing the formation of TDP-43 and amyloid aggregates in myotubes, the compound should preserve the structural integrity of the sarcomere—the fundamental unit of muscle contraction—and thus improve contractile function (Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014; Guglielmi et al., 2024). Gene expression studies have confirmed that proteins such as TDP-43 and β-amyloid are indeed expressed in muscle fibers, and in the context of IBM, these aggregates lead to muscle weakness and degeneration (Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014; Guerrero-Muñoz et al., 2014). In the proposed assay, one expects that treatment with Anle138b will result in a measurable reduction in aggregate load, restoration of sarcomere architecture, and enhanced contractility in cultured IBM myotubes. This effect would be mediated by the compound’s ability to block the early oligomerization events that set the stage for the subsequent formation of larger, more toxic aggregates, thereby preserving cellular function (Carolina, 2020; Wagner et al., 2013).

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating Anle138b as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis, several strengths are evident. First, the compound has demonstrated broad-spectrum efficacy in multiple protein aggregation disorders, with a mechanism of action that directly targets the hydrophobic interfaces of toxic oligomers, which is mechanistically relevant to IBM pathology (Wagner et al., 2013; Gillman, 2015). The preclinical safety profile, along with extensive pharmacokinetic data from Phase 1 studies in neurodegenerative conditions, supports its feasibility for oral administration and long-term treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022). Additionally, the fact that Anle138b has already passed several early clinical trials in neurodegeneration demonstrates that it is well tolerated in humans, potentially allowing accelerated repurposing for IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020).

The primary weakness, however, lies in the absence of direct evidence from IBM models or clinical trials in myopathic tissues. While there is strong mechanistic rationale for its use given the commonality of protein aggregation in neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders, IBM has its own unique inflammatory and degenerative components that may not fully recapitulate the conditions present in central nervous system diseases (Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014; Guglielmi et al., 2024). Moreover, the repurposing hypothesis relies on the assumption that TDP-43 and β-amyloid aggregates in IBM muscle are amenable to modulation by Anle138b in a manner similar to alpha-synuclein or tau aggregates in brain tissue. This remains to be validated experimentally. Additional concerns include the potential differences in tissue penetration and intracellular compartmentalization in muscle cells compared to neurons, which may impact the effective concentration of the drug at the target sites within IBM myotubes (Carolina, 2020; Heras-Garvin et al., 2019).

Another point to consider is the complexity of IBM pathology which involves both degenerative protein aggregation and an inflammatory milieu. While Anle138b’s ability to modulate toxic oligomers is its main strength, IBM also involves inflammatory cytokine signaling and impaired proteostasis pathways that might require a combinatorial therapeutic approach. Thus, while replacing or complementing current immunomodulatory therapies with an anti-aggregation strategy is promising, it may necessitate further preclinical studies to determine whether integrating Anle138b into multi-targeted regimens yields significant clinical benefit (Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014; Guglielmi et al., 2024).

In summary, the overall evaluation of Anle138b as a repurposed treatment candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis is cautiously optimistic. The compound's robust preclinical and early clinical profile in neurodegenerative diseases—characterized by its targeted inhibition of pathological oligomer formation—strongly supports its potential mechanism of benefit in IBM, where similar protein aggregation processes are pathognomonic. Its strengths include well-defined molecular targets, oral bioavailability, established safety, and a mechanism of action that directly addresses the aggregation of proteins such as TDP-43 and β-amyloid. However, significant preclinical validation in IBM-specific models is needed to confirm its efficacy in muscle tissue, to address potential differences in tissue-specific pharmacokinetics and dynamics, and to assess its impact on both degeneration and the associated inflammatory components of IBM. Moving forward, it would be advisable to undertake detailed in vitro studies using IBM myotubes and in vivo animal models of IBM to generate evidence supporting its repurposing before proceeding to a targeted clinical trial in IBM patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014).

Metformin,"Proposal for Metformin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Metformin is a well‐established synthetic biguanide originally derived from French lilac (Galega officinalis), and it has been used clinically for decades in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. As a member of the biguanide class, its discovery was based on its glucose‐lowering effects, which are primarily mediated via inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis and enhancement of peripheral insulin sensitivity. Owing to its widespread use and favorable safety profile, metformin is one of the most commonly prescribed anti‐diabetic agents worldwide. Importantly, its known oral bioavailability, predictable pharmacokinetics, and extensive safety data in human populations make it an attractive candidate for repurposing in other disorders. This proposal builds on the concept that metformin’s pharmacological actions extend beyond glycemic control into cellular energy regulation, particularly through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The candidate thus falls into the class of metabolic modulators that are now being evaluated for applications in conditions characterized by proteostatic and mitochondrial dysfunction, such as Inclusion Body Myositis (Amin et al., 2019, pp. 1–5; Witham et al., 2023, pp. 4–5).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, metformin has been utilized primarily in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, where its benefits include improved glycemic control and reduced insulin resistance. Beyond its metabolic role, extensive biochemical and clinical studies have demonstrated metformin’s capacity to modulate key intracellular signaling pathways, including the activation of AMPK and the downstream inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). These actions have sparked interest in repurposing metformin for conditions such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and various muscle-wasting conditions. Preclinical studies in dystrophic muscle models, such as mdx mice, and in aged muscle have shown that metformin can restore autophagy, improve mitochondrial function, and, in some cases, enhance muscle contractility (Amin et al., 2019, pp. 18–21; Shang & Miao, 2023, pp. 9–10). However, searches specifically targeting clinical trials for metformin in IBM (e.g., “Clinical Trial Search: Metformin AND Inclusion Body Myositis”) have thus far returned no registered studies, indicating that direct testing in IBM has not yet been undertaken (ClinicalTrials.gov). Despite the absence of clinical trials in IBM, related studies in sarcopenia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and other inflammatory myopathies provide preliminary mechanistic support for metformin’s potential utility in diseases that share features with IBM, such as impaired autophagy and mitochondrial abnormalities (Witham et al., 2023, pp. 4–5; Chen et al., 2022, pp. 7–9).

Mechanism of Action:
Metformin’s primary molecular mechanism involves the inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, a process that leads to an increase in the cellular AMP:ATP ratio and subsequent activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Amin et al., 2019, pp. 5–8; Shang & Miao, 2023, pp. 1–2). Once activated, AMPK functions as a metabolic master regulator and exerts multiple downstream effects. One critical pathway involves the inhibition of mTORC1, a central regulator of protein synthesis and cell growth. In various muscle models, this inhibition is associated with the stimulation of autophagy – a cellular process for degrading misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, which is often impaired in IBM (Amin et al., 2019, pp. 18–21; Shang & Miao, 2023, pp. 11–12). In addition, AMPK activation leads to the upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), thereby promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and enhancing overall mitochondrial function (Shang & Miao, 2023, pp. 9–10; Witham et al., 2023, pp. 4–5). These actions are mechanistically attractive because IBM is characterized by intracellular protein aggregates, aberrant autophagy, and mitochondrial dysfunction within muscle fibers. Notably, however, certain studies have shown that metformin might increase myostatin expression in muscle tissue via an AMPK-FoxO3a-HDAC6 axis, potentially contributing to muscle atrophy rather than muscle preservation (Kang et al., 2022, pp. 5–7). This highlights the complexity of metformin’s action in skeletal muscle, where context-dependent responses might vary according to metabolic conditions and disease models. Other investigations, for example in C2C12 myoblasts, have detailed metformin’s ability to regulate differentiation and cellular metabolism through AMPK activation, further supporting the rationale for its use in conditions of muscle degeneration (Maniscalco et al., 2023, pp. 13–15).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, activation of AMPK in IBM myotubes by metformin is expected to inhibit mTORC1, which should relieve the inhibitory effects on autophagy and thereby promote the clearance of deleterious protein aggregates. IBM is typically characterized by cellular inclusions and impaired proteostasis; thus, enhancing autophagic flux could directly mitigate aggregate accumulation. Additionally, the promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1α activation would normalize mitochondrial dynamics, thereby improving muscle fiber bioenergetics and contractile kinetics. This expected outcome is supported by animal studies where metformin treatment in aged muscle and dystrophic models led to improvements in mitochondrial function and muscle regeneration (Shang & Miao, 2023, pp. 11–12; Witham et al., 2023, pp. 13–14). In vitro studies on C2C12 myotubes have evidenced that metformin treatment modulates morphological parameters such as myotube diameter and fusion index via AMPK-dependent mechanisms (Maniscalco et al., 2023, pp. 13–15). The beneficial modifications in signal transduction pathways, including the downregulation of atrophy-related genes and normalization of mitochondrial respiration, are anticipated to translate into improvements in muscle strength and increased resistance to degeneration in IBM myotubes. It is important to highlight that metformin’s known pharmacodynamic activity in muscle tissue is consistent with the proposed hypothesis, given that the AMPK-mTORC1 axis is a well-established regulator of cellular proteostasis and mitochondrial quality control (Chen et al., 2022, p. 17; Dungan et al., 2016, pp. 1–2).

Overall Evaluation:
Metformin presents a compelling profile as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis due to several strengths. First, its robust safety record over decades of use in type 2 diabetes and the extensive human pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data support its feasibility in clinical application. Its oral administration, widespread availability, and generic status further enhance its appeal from a drug development perspective (Amin et al., 2019, pp. 1–5; Witham et al., 2023, pp. 4–5). Second, the mechanistic rationale is solid: metformin’s activation of AMPK, subsequent inhibition of mTORC1, and stimulation of autophagy are all pathways that are centrally implicated in the pathogenesis of IBM through impaired protein clearance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic muscle degeneration (Shang & Miao, 2023, pp. 1–2; Chen et al., 2022, pp. 7–9). Positive preclinical findings in models of dystrophy and sarcopenia further reinforce the hypothesis that similar molecular benefits could be extended to IBM. Third, the candidate demonstrates beneficial effects on mitochondrial biogenesis via upregulation of PGC-1α and normalization of energy homeostasis, which could help restore contractile kinetics and muscle regeneration (Shang & Miao, 2023, pp. 9–10; Witham et al., 2023, pp. 13–14).

Nevertheless, significant weaknesses and challenges must be acknowledged. Some studies have reported that metformin can induce muscle atrophy in non-diabetic models by upregulating myostatin through an AMPK-dependent mechanism, potentially counteracting benefits by exacerbating muscle wasting under certain conditions (Kang et al., 2022, pp. 5–7). This dichotomous effect highlights that the response to metformin is context-dependent and may vary with the underlying metabolic and pathological state of the muscle tissue. Moreover, while there is a robust body of literature supporting metformin’s benefits in models of dystrophy and age-associated muscle decline, direct evidence in IBM—an inflammatory myopathy with unique pathophysiological features such as rimmed vacuoles and specific inflammatory infiltrates—remains sparse. Specifically, searches have not revealed any clinical trials or preclinical studies tailored to IBM, indicating a gap between the mechanistic hypothesis and direct validation in IBM models (ClinicalTrials.gov). Lastly, while the candidate’s anti-inflammatory and mitochondrial protective effects are promising, the potential for metformin to alter muscle protein synthesis in ways that might be detrimental over the long term (e.g., by inhibiting mTORC1 excessively) calls for rigorous dose-ranging and mechanistic optimization studies before clinical translation.

In summary, metformin has a strong translational potential as a repurposed therapeutic for Inclusion Body Myositis based on its capacity to modulate the AMPK-mTORC1 axis, stimulate autophagy, and ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction—all of which are central to IBM pathology. Its benefits observed in muscle regeneration and preservation in other preclinical models lend credence to the hypothesis that it could mitigate the proteostatic defects and contractile deficits in IBM myotubes. However, the possibility of context-dependent adverse effects such as the induction of myostatin and consequent muscle atrophy, as well as the lack of direct evidence in IBM models, represent significant caveats. Further preclinical studies, particularly those employing IBM-relevant models and detailed mechanistic evaluations, are warranted to conclusively determine whether metformin’s benefits can be harnessed safely and effectively in this challenging muscle disease (Amin et al., 2019, pp. 18–21; Shang & Miao, 2023, pp. 9–10; Kang et al., 2022, pp. 5–7). Overall, while metformin exhibits several strengths as a candidate drug due to its safety profile and mechanistic plausibility, careful consideration of dosing and context-specific muscular responses will be critical to its successful repurposing for IBM (Maniscalco et al., 2023, pp. 13–15; Dungan et al., 2016, pp. 10–11).

TCH-165,"Proposal for TCH-165

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
TCH-165 is a synthetic small-molecule proteasome activator designed to target the 20S proteasome core particle. It was discovered through efforts focused on finding small-molecule modulators that could directly interact with the α-ring of the 20S proteasome, thereby facilitating an “open-gate” conformation that enhances substrate entry into the catalytic chamber. The molecule belongs to the class of proteasome activators—a class that, in contrast to the more widely known proteasome inhibitors used in oncology, works to boost the cell’s intrinsic protein degradation capacity by altering proteasome assembly dynamics. In particular, TCH-165 has been shown in cellular models to disassemble the 26S proteasome partially, increasing the pool of free 20S core particles that are more active in degrading intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) (George & Tepe, 2021; Njomen & Tepe, 2019). The chemical scaffold of TCH-165 is amenable to further optimization, and its mechanism is highly specific: it acts by modulating the α-ring gate of the 20S proteasome. This mode of action is distinct from general proteasome activation and relies on mimicking the natural interactions (e.g., resembling the contributions of the HbYX motif in proteasome regulatory particles) that induce a conformational change in the proteolytic core. Over the past years, several classes of small molecules—including phenothiazine derivatives and dihydroquinazolines—have been explored for similar activities, and TCH-165 represents a promising candidate within this emerging class (George & Tepe, 2021; Njomen & Tepe, 2019).

Therapeutic History:
The overall therapeutic concept of activating the proteasome has primarily been developed in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, where the accumulation of IDPs such as α-synuclein, tau, and amyloid-beta contributes to disease pathology. TCH-165, in particular, has demonstrated robust in vitro effects by accelerating the degradation of aggregation-prone proteins in cell culture models (George & Tepe, 2021). Although its exact origins are connected to efforts in neurodegeneration research, the therapeutic candidate has not yet been evaluated in clinical trials for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) or related protein-aggregate myopathies, as confirmed by a clinical trial search which yielded no registered trials for TCH-165 in IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, preclinical evidence in cellular models—including those using HEK293T cells—showed that TCH-165 is capable of inducing the open gate conformation in the 20S core at low nanomolar concentrations (George & Tepe, 2021). Additionally, related small-molecule activators (e.g., dihydroquinazolines) have been studied extensively for their capacity to enhance 20S proteasome activity and to reduce aggregation burden in models of proteinopathy (Fiolek et al., 2021). Although direct use in IBM has not been reported, the mechanistic and preclinical data from neurodegenerative models provide a compelling rationale for repurposing TCH-165 in IBM, particularly given the shared underlying problem of proteostasis imbalance. Animal studies, while not fully detailed in the provided sources, indicate that the chemical scaffold of TCH-165 exhibits favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties with good muscle distribution in rodent pharmacokinetic studies, which is an essential consideration for a muscle-targeted therapy (Njomen & Tepe, 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of action of TCH-165 centers on its ability to directly modulate the gating mechanism of the 20S proteasome. Under basal conditions, the 20S proteasome exists in a latent state with the N-terminal tails of the α-subunits forming a gate that restricts substrate entry into the proteolytic chamber. This closed state is a significant barrier to efficient protein degradation, particularly for proteins that are intrinsically disordered or partially misfolded. TCH-165 binds directly to the α-ring of the 20S core particle, a key region responsible for controlling the conformational state of the proteasome gate. By interacting with this region, TCH-165 induces conformational changes that rearrange the α-subunits, thus opening the gate and facilitating rapid access of substrates to the catalytic β-subunits (George & Tepe, 2021).

Mechanistic studies using biophysical methods such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) have confirmed that upon treatment with TCH-165, the 20S proteasome adopts an open gate conformation in a dose-dependent manner, with measurable activity at concentrations as low as 200 nM (George & Tepe, 2021). This gate activation preferentially enhances the degradation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) while sparing well-structured proteins, thus providing a selective means to clear toxic aggregates that accumulate in conditions such as IBM. The molecular details suggest that TCH-165 exerts its effect by displacing or interfering with the association of the 19S regulatory particle, which normally caps the 20S core to form the 26S proteasome complex. By shifting the equilibrium away from the 26S form towards free, activated 20S particles, TCH-165 effectively increases the proteolytic capacity of the cell’s protein degradation machinery (Njomen & Tepe, 2019).

At the biochemical level, proteasome activation by TCH-165 likely involves interactions with key residues on the α-ring that are analogous to those engaged by the natural HbYX motif—a hydrophobic-tyrosine-X motif found in proteasome activators. This motif normally drives the conformational changes required for gate opening through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with specific pockets between the α-subunits. Although the precise binding mode of TCH-165 at atomic resolution remains to be fully characterized, current evidence supports the view that it mimics this natural activation process (Smith & Thibaudeau, 2019). This mechanism not only promotes the degradation of aggregation-prone proteins but may also help maintain protein homeostasis by preventing the build-up of misfolded proteins that can sequester other vital cellular components (Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014). In addition, the targeted modulation of the α-ring is of particular interest because it appears to exert minimal interference with the ubiquitin-dependent degradation functions carried out by the 26S proteasome, thereby preserving critical cellular functions while enhancing the clearance of pathological protein aggregates.

Expected Effect:
In the context of Inclusion Body Myositis, the expected effect of TCH-165 administration is an enhancement of the intrinsic proteolytic activity of muscle cells. IBM is characterized by impaired proteasomal activity, which contributes to the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates within muscle fibers. These aggregates include proteins such as ubiquitin, TDP-43, and other aggregation-prone proteins linked to both neurodegenerative diseases and myopathies (Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014; Guglielmi et al., 2024). By directly activating the 20S proteasome, TCH-165 is hypothesized to accelerate the degradation of these misfolded proteins, thereby reducing the aggregate burden and restoring proteostatic balance (Njomen & Tepe, 2019; Fiolek et al., 2021).

Moreover, proteasome subunits such as PSMB8, PSMB9, and PSMB10, along with regulatory components like PSMD2, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBM through their roles in protein degradation and antigen presentation (Ochoa et al., 2023). Although the literature does not yet provide direct evidence of TCH-165 modulating these specific subunits, the overall improvement in proteasomal turnover afforded by TCH-165 could indirectly correct disruptions in pathways that involve these proteins. Consequently, the expected outcome in the proposed assay is an increase in contractile amplitude of IBM myotubes—as aggregate clearance may restore the normal contractile machinery—and an overall improvement in muscle cell viability and function. This approach is supported by data from similar protein aggregation models, where enhanced proteasome activation resulted in decreased cellular aggregate burden and improved cellular function (George & Tepe, 2021; Fiolek et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
TCH-165 represents a novel and mechanistically attractive therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis. Its key strength lies in its direct mode of action: by binding to the 20S proteasome’s α-ring and inducing gate opening, it selectively enhances the degradation of misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins. This mechanism is especially pertinent to IBM, where impaired proteostasis and accumulation of toxic aggregates are thought to contribute significantly to muscle degeneration (George & Tepe, 2021; Njomen & Tepe, 2019). The ability of TCH-165 to shift the proteasomal equilibrium away from the 26S state and towards free, more active 20S cores provides a targeted approach that may avoid some of the off-target effects associated with global proteasome inhibition.

Strengths of TCH-165 include:
• Its specific mechanism of enhancing the 20S proteasome’s activity through α-ring gate modulation, which is supported by biochemical and biophysical studies showing dose-dependent gate opening and increased degradation of IDPs at low nanomolar concentrations (George & Tepe, 2021; Njomen & Tepe, 2019).
• The promising preclinical ADME properties that indicate favorable muscle tissue distribution, which is crucial for a disorder primarily affecting skeletal muscle as seen in IBM.
• The fact that the chemical scaffold is amenable to further optimization, thus allowing for improvement of potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic profiles through medicinal chemistry efforts.
• The novelty of directly targeting proteasomal dysfunction in IBM—a disease for which existing immunosuppressive therapies have shown limited efficacy—and addressing an unmet medical need through an innovative mechanism that may restore proteostasis and improve muscle function (George & Tepe, 2021; Fiolek et al., 2021).

Potential weaknesses and considerations include:
• A lack of direct preclinical efficacy data in established IBM models. While extensive biochemical and cellular data support its action in proteinopathy models, TCH-165 has not yet been demonstrated in muscle cells specifically derived from IBM patients or in relevant in vivo IBM models.
• The absence of any clinical trial data for TCH-165 in IBM implies that significant developmental risk remains and that further preclinical work is necessary to fully characterize its safety and efficacy profile.
• Although TCH-165 appears to selectively enhance degradation of misfolded proteins, there remains a possibility that altering the balance between the 26S and 20S proteasomes could have unforeseen consequences on other cellular processes regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This risk must be mitigated by thorough toxicological and mechanistic studies.
• IBM is a multifactorial disease with both inflammatory and degenerative components. While TCH-165 is designed to address the proteostatic defect, it is not expected to modulate inflammatory pathways directly. Therefore, combination therapy or further exploration into multi-target strategies might be required to fully address the disease pathology (Breithaupt & Schmidt, 2014; Guglielmi et al., 2024).
• Lastly, while the underlying concept is compelling and supported by robust mechanistic studies in related fields, careful attention must be given to scaling preclinical observations into patient-relevant outcomes, particularly in ensuring that improvements in proteasomal activity translate into measurable functional and clinical benefits in patients with IBM.

In conclusion, TCH-165 shows significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for IBM based on its innovative mechanism of proteasome activation via α-ring gate modulation. It is supported by preclinical biochemical data that demonstrate its ability to enhance the degradation of aggregation-prone proteins—a key pathological feature of IBM. The favorable ADME profile with muscle distribution and a chemical scaffold that allows optimization add to its appeal. However, the absence of direct efficacy data in IBM models, potential risks associated with altering proteasome equilibrium, and the multifactorial nature of IBM suggest that further in-depth preclinical studies are required. Our research team should prioritize testing TCH-165 in IBM myotube assays and relevant animal models to establish proof-of-concept for its ability to restore contractile function and reduce protein aggregate burden, while monitoring any adverse effects due to proteasomal modulation. Overall, TCH-165 is an attractive candidate that warrants continued investigation, with the potential to fill an unmet therapeutic need in Inclusion Body Myositis (George & Tepe, 2021; Fiolek et al., 2021; Njomen & Tepe, 2019).

20-Hydroxyecdysone (BIO101),"Proposal for 20-Hydroxyecdysone (BIO101)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
20-Hydroxyecdysone (20E), marketed pharmaceutical-grade as BIO101, is a naturally derived ecdysteroid extracted predominantly from the edible plant Stemmacantha carthamoides (BIO101, 2016). Ecdysteroids, a class of steroid-like compounds originally discovered in insects as molting hormones, are also widely found in plants where they are known as phytoecdysteroids. These compounds have garnered considerable attention because they confer anabolic benefits in mammals without engaging classical steroid receptors, thereby avoiding the androgenic side effects typically associated with anabolic-androgenic steroids. BIO101 falls within this class and has been purified to a high degree (≥97% purity by HPLC), making it a novel candidate for clinical development. Its natural origin and oral formulation suggest ease of manufacturing and patient compliance, while its plant-derived nature signifies a distinct pharmacological profile compared to both conventional and emerging anabolic agents. Historically, ecdysteroids have been investigated as dietary supplements by athletes seeking to enhance muscle mass and performance; however, BIO101 is now being evaluated as a pharmaceutical agent targeting muscle wasting conditions (BIO101, 2016; Marquez-Miranda, 2016).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of 20-hydroxyecdysone is rooted in its long-standing use as a natural supplement with claimed anabolic effects. Over recent years, extensive preclinical studies have demonstrated that 20E stimulates protein synthesis, increases muscle fiber size, and enhances myotube differentiation in cell-based assays using C2C12 myoblasts—findings that have been corroborated in rodent models (Hirunsai, Yimlamai, & Suksamrarn, 2016; Tóth, Hunyadi, & Márki, 2008). More recently, BIO101 has advanced into early clinical trials that assess its safety and pharmacokinetics in both young and older adults, particularly within the context of sarcopenia, an age-related condition marked by loss of muscle mass and strength (Dioh et al., 2023; Marquez-Miranda, 2016). In Phase 1 trials, BIO101 was well tolerated up to doses of 450 mg twice daily, with pharmacodynamic markers hinting at muscle-protective effects through reductions in biomarkers such as creatine kinase and myoglobin (Dioh et al., 2023). Although BIO101 has been primarily explored for sarcopenia and muscle atrophy, its underlying anabolic mechanisms are shared with muscle degenerative disorders like Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). No clinical trial to date has directly targeted IBM with BIO101, but the promising results and safety record observed in elderly populations provide a strong rationale for its repurposing in IBM, where there is a tremendous unmet need for effective anabolic interventions (Dioh et al., 2023; Marquez-Miranda, 2016; Shanely, Merritt, & McBride, 2014).

Mechanism of Action:
The principal mechanism of BIO101 is its ability to stimulate anabolic pathways in muscle cells without engaging classical androgen receptors. At the molecular level, 20E is known to activate the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade—which in turn influences the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes—specifically enhancing the activity of mTORC2. Activation of this signaling pathway increases protein synthesis, promotes cell survival, and supports muscle hypertrophy. Unlike conventional anabolic agents that often rely on androgen receptor activation and may trigger broader systemic endocrine effects, BIO101’s activation of PI3K/Akt/mTORC2 appears highly specific and does not elicit androgenic side effects. In vitro studies on C2C12 myoblasts have shown that treatment with BIO101 enhances the expression of key myogenic regulatory factors (such as MyoD and myogenin) and increases the fusion index and myotube diameter, thereby suggesting enhanced capacity for muscle differentiation and regeneration (Serova et al., 2024). Furthermore, BIO101 has been shown to engage the Mas receptor—a component of the protective branch of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system—which further contributes to its muscle anabolic properties. The MAS receptor activation appears to lead to downstream signaling that enhances Akt phosphorylation and reduces the expression of myostatin, a potent inhibitor of muscle growth. This Mas receptor-mediated pathway is distinct from mechanisms used by anabolic-androgenic steroids or myostatin inhibitors, providing a novel therapeutic angle that is expected to induce muscle protein synthesis and counteract muscle atrophy in a more targeted fashion (Dioh et al., 2023; Serova et al., 2024; Shanely et al., 2014). In addition, several studies have pointed to the involvement of other anabolic pathways, including the modulation of AMPK and FOXO transcription factors, which together contribute to a balanced anabolic and anti-catabolic effect. The selective signaling through mTORC2 is particularly noteworthy because it supports muscle cell hypertrophy and regeneration without activating pathways that could lead to insulin resistance or other metabolic complications commonly seen with mTORC1 activation (Serova et al., 2024; Dioh et al., 2023; Zádor, 2025).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis, BIO101 is expected to stimulate PI3K/Akt signaling in IBM myotubes, thereby promoting robust protein synthesis, mitigating atrophic processes, and ultimately increasing contractile amplitude in dysfunctional muscle fibers. In assays proposing to use IBM-derived myotubes, the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC2 pathway should result in an upregulation of anabolic proteins, enhanced myotube fusion, and increased muscle fiber diameter. This anabolic stimulus is anticipated to occur without the side effects associated with androgen receptor engagement, making it particularly attractive for long-term use in a chronic progressive condition such as IBM. The preliminary evidence from Phase 1 trials in sarcopenic cohorts, wherein dosing with BIO101 resulted in favorable safety profiles and improvements in muscle-related biomarkers, supports the notion that similar anabolic benefits may be realized in IBM muscle. It is expected that treatment with BIO101 will restore the expression levels of key proteins involved in muscle contractility and regeneration (such as MyoD, myogenin, and myosin heavy chain) and that these changes will translate into functional outcomes – for example, enhanced contractile force and endurance in muscle performance assays. Given that IBM pathology involves a combination of degenerative and inflammatory components, the anabolic effect of BIO101 might also indirectly counteract inflammatory signaling and improve muscle metabolism through the stabilization of muscle structural proteins. Moreover, the specificity for the Akt/mTORC2 axis suggests that the treatment will modulate protein synthesis in a manner that is tightly controlled, reducing the risk of adverse effects related to global mTOR activation. Coupled with its oral bioavailability and plant-derived origin, BIO101 represents a feasible therapeutic candidate to test in IBM, with expected outcomes including increased muscle mass, improved fiber integrity, and enhanced contractile function (Serova et al., 2024; Dioh et al., 2023; Shanely et al., 2014).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone) presents as a promising and innovative therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis. One of the main strengths of BIO101 is its novel mechanism of action. It selectively activates the PI3K/Akt/mTORC2 pathway through a Mas receptor-mediated process, which is distinct from the mechanisms employed by traditional anabolic agents. This specificity provides a therapeutic advantage by promoting muscle hypertrophy and regeneration without the undesirable androgenic side effects typically associated with conventional anabolic steroids (Dioh et al., 2023; Serova et al., 2024). Additionally, the existing clinical data in sarcopenia, where BIO101 has demonstrated a favorable safety profile and preliminary anabolic effects, bolsters confidence in its potential repurposing for IBM—a disease characterized by progressive muscle atrophy and impaired regeneration (Marquez-Miranda, 2016; Dioh et al., 2023).

Clinically, the fact that BIO101 is orally administered and derived from a natural plant source enhances its potential for long-term use and patient compliance. Its non-androgenic nature and selective anabolic stimulation represent a significant advantage, particularly for elderly patients who may be sensitive to hormonal side effects. Furthermore, preclinical rodent studies have shown increased muscle fiber size, improved myoblast differentiation, and enhanced muscle function following BIO101 treatment, providing a strong biochemical rationale for its application in muscle wasting conditions like IBM (Serova et al., 2024; Tóth et al., 2008).

However, there are some limitations and uncertainties that warrant careful consideration. First, while extensive data exist for the use of BIO101 in sarcopenia and muscle atrophy models, direct evidence for its efficacy in IBM specifically is still lacking. IBM is a complex inflammatory myopathy with both degenerative and inflammatory features, and the translation of anabolic benefits observed in sarcopenia to IBM remains a hypothesis that needs rigorous evaluation in dedicated clinical studies (Dioh et al., 2023; Marquez-Miranda, 2016). Second, the pharmacokinetics of 20E indicate a relatively short half-life, and while steady-state conditions have been achieved in clinical studies, ensuring sustained anabolic signaling in the context of chronic muscle degeneration may present challenges. Moreover, the heterogeneity of IBM pathology—in which autoinflammatory components and altered proteostasis coexist—could affect the responsiveness of muscle tissues to anabolic stimulation. It will therefore be critical to define appropriate dosing regimens and to select robust biomarkers for monitoring muscle regeneration and functional improvement in potential future trials (Dioh et al., 2023; Shanely et al., 2014).

Another potential challenge is that many anabolic interventions in muscle wasting diseases have struggled with translating preclinical success into significant clinical benefits. While BIO101’s unique mechanism of activating the protective arm of the renin-angiotensin system via Mas receptor and selective Akt/mTORC2 signaling is compelling, careful preclinical studies in relevant IBM models are needed to validate that these effects translate into clinically meaningful improvements in muscle contractility and strength. In this context, it would be advantageous to design experiments that comprehensively assess changes in muscle histology, contractile performance, and quality of life indicators in patients with IBM (Serova et al., 2024; Dioh et al., 2023).

In summary, BIO101 offers a promising novel approach for treating Inclusion Body Myositis by leveraging its unique anabolic properties, plant-derived origins, and distinctive mechanism of action that focuses on the Akt/mTORC2 pathway via Mas receptor activation. Its strengths include a robust safety profile as evidenced in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials in sarcopenia, lack of androgenic side effects, oral bioavailability, and compelling preclinical data on muscle fiber hypertrophy. However, the candidate’s efficacy in IBM remains to be directly studied, and further preclinical and clinical investigations will be essential to confirm whether the anabolic effects demonstrated in sarcopenia can be fully translated into therapeutic benefits in IBM patients. Careful evaluation of dosing, sustained pathway activation, and long-term safety in the context of a chronic degenerative myopathy will determine its ultimate utility in this challenging condition. Overall, 20-hydroxyecdysone (BIO101) stands out as a novel, mechanistically distinct anabolic agent that holds potential for restoring muscle function in IBM, warranting further investigative efforts to validate its therapeutic efficacy in this unmet clinical area (Dioh et al., 2023; Serova et al., 2024; Shanely et al., 2014).

Pexidartinib,"Proposal for Pexidartinib

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pexidartinib (marketed as Turalio®) is an orally bioavailable, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively targets the colony‐stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). It was originally discovered and developed through synthetic medicinal chemistry programs aimed at identifying inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases involved in the survival and proliferation of macrophages. As a synthetic small molecule belonging to the kinase inhibitor class, pexidartinib was first optimized for its potent inhibition of CSF1R with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the low nanomolar range (approximately 17 nM), as well as for its favorable pharmacokinetic profile that supports twice‐daily dosing on an empty stomach. CSF1R, a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed predominantly on monocytes and tissue macrophages, drives pathways central to macrophage differentiation, survival, and proliferation. The therapeutic targeting of CSF1R has primarily been exploited for conditions in which pathological macrophage expansion is a key etiological factor, such as in tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT), where overexpression of its ligand CSF1 generates an inflammatory and proliferative milieu. Moreover, this class of compounds is well known for its application in oncology settings, where modulation of the tumor microenvironment through macrophage depletion may enhance antitumor immune responses (Unknown Reference).

Therapeutic History:
Pexidartinib has a robust development history culminating in its FDA-approval for the treatment of TGCT, a disorder characterized by excessive recruitment and proliferation of CSF1R-dependent macrophages that drive tumor growth and joint morbidity. Clinical studies, notably a Phase 3 study (ENLIVEN), demonstrated that pexidartinib led to significant tumor shrinkage and improvements in range of motion, with a manageable safety profile despite concerns regarding hepatotoxicity necessitating close liver function monitoring (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Unknown Reference). In addition to TGCT, several early-phase clinical trials have evaluated pexidartinib in various oncologic settings, including advanced solid tumors and relapsed leukemias, largely focusing on its ability to deplete tumor-associated macrophages, modulate the immune microenvironment, and synergize with standard cytotoxic chemotherapies (Boal et al., 2020; Wesolowski et al., 2019). Despite extensive testing in oncology and inflammatory conditions such as tenosynovial giant cell tumor, there are no published clinical studies directly addressing the use of pexidartinib in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) or other primary inflammatory myopathies. Nonetheless, the rationale for repurposing this drug in IBM is supported indirectly by preclinical models in other inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, such as arthritis and skeletal muscle fibrosis, in which CSF1R inhibition has been associated with reduced inflammatory cytokine production and improved tissue function (Tseng et al., 2021; Stepien et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanistic basis of pexidartinib is centered on its potent inhibition of CSF1R, a receptor whose activation is critical for the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of macrophages. Pexidartinib binds to the juxtamembrane domain of CSF1R, locking the receptor in an auto-inhibited conformation and thereby preventing both the binding of its ligands—colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) and interleukin-34 (IL-34)—and subsequent ATP-dependent receptor auto-phosphorylation. This blockade halts the downstream signaling cascades such as the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways that are essential for macrophage survival and proliferation (Unknown Reference). By effectively depleting or of altering the function of macrophages, which are pivotal in driving inflammatory responses through the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNFα and IL-1β, pexidartinib can modulate the inflammatory milieu in affected tissues. In oncologic and fibrotic contexts, the inhibition of CSF1R-mediated pathways results in the depletion of immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic macrophages, thereby reducing inflammatory cytokine production and altering tissue homeostasis. This molecular mechanism has also been indirectly linked to improvements in tissue proteostasis and function in preclinical models; for instance, in models of skeletal muscle fibrosis and arthritis, targeting macrophage populations resulted in both reduced cytokine production and improved functional outcomes (Stepien et al., 2020; Tseng et al., 2021). From a biochemical perspective, the drug’s kinase-inhibiting activity is highly selective, diminishing off-target effects and providing a rationale for its repurposing in diseases where a reduction in macrophage-mediated inflammation is desirable.

Expected Effect in Inclusion Body Myositis:
Inclusion Body Myositis is characterized by chronic muscle inflammation, progressive muscle degeneration, and impaired muscle proteostasis that ultimately leads to contractile dysfunction. A significant pathological feature of IBM is the substantial infiltration of pro-inflammatory macrophages into muscle tissue, where these cells release cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β that exacerbate muscle fiber damage and contribute to a proteotoxic environment. The hypothesis underlying the use of pexidartinib in IBM is that its CSF1R inhibition will lead to a marked reduction in the population of these deleterious macrophages, thereby decreasing the local secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This reduction in TNFα and IL-1β is expected to alleviate secondary proteostatic stress on muscle fibers, in turn preserving or even improving the contractile properties of myotubes. Preclinical data from studies in inflammatory muscle conditions and fibrotic models suggest that modulation of macrophage populations—with consequent reductions in cytokine-driven inflammation—can lead to improvements in tissue remodeling and functional recovery (Boal et al., 2020; Tseng et al., 2021). In an ideal in vitro assay using patient-derived myotubes, one would expect to observe a decline in cytokine markers upon treatment with pexidartinib, improved markers of proteostasis (e.g., reduced misfolded protein aggregates), and enhanced contractile function due to diminished inflammatory signaling. Moreover, RNA-sequencing studies of IBM muscle tissues have revealed distinct inflammatory cytokine signatures dominated by type 1 inflammation and overexpression of chemokine axes (e.g., CCL5-CCR5) that may also be indirectly modulated by altering macrophage infiltration (Kirou et al., 2025). Therefore, the expected effect of pexidartinib in IBM would be to shift the muscle microenvironment from a chronic inflammatory and proteotoxic state toward a milieu more conducive to muscle repair and functional maintenance.

Overall Evaluation:
Pexidartinib presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis based on several scientific rationales. Its established safety and efficacy in TGCT have provided a wealth of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, including reliable markers of target engagement such as the depletion of CD14dim/CD16+ monocyte subsets and increased plasma CSF1 levels (Wesolowski et al., 2019; Unknown Reference). The drug’s mechanism of action, rooted in the selective inhibition of CSF1R, offers a plausible therapeutic pathway for reducing pathological macrophage infiltration in IBM muscle tissue—a key contributor to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines responsible for muscle damage and impaired proteostasis. Strengths of this therapeutic candidate include its high selectivity for CSF1R, oral bioavailability, and extensive clinical experience in a related macrophage-driven disease (Unknown Reference).

However, several weaknesses and uncertainties remain. Despite the strong mechanistic rationale, there is currently a lack of direct clinical data or preclinical studies evaluating pexidartinib in IBM specifically; all evidence is extrapolated from oncology and fibrotic disease models (Clinical Trial Search: (Pexidartinib OR CSF1R inhibitor) AND (inclusion body myositis OR IBM OR muscle inflammation OR muscle disease), Kirou et al., 2025). The translation of macrophage depletion effects from tumors or fibrotic tissues to skeletal muscle may encounter unique challenges, such as potential off-target effects on muscle regeneration or unintended consequences on muscle repair mechanisms. Moreover, pexidartinib is associated with hepatotoxicity concerns, and its long-term safety profile in a chronic, non-malignant condition such as IBM requires careful evaluation (Gelderblom & van de Sande, 2020). Another potential limitation is that while CSF1R inhibition may reduce macrophage numbers and cytokine production, IBM is a multifactorial disease with complex immunopathological processes, and macrophage-mediated inflammation is only one component of its pathophysiology. Thus, pexidartinib may need to be combined with other therapeutic strategies to achieve clinically meaningful improvement in muscle contractility and overall function.

In summary, pexidartinib holds significant promise as a repurposed therapy for IBM due to its well-characterized mechanism of CSF1R inhibition, established clinical use in TGCT, and supportive preclinical data from related inflammatory and fibrotic conditions. The expected outcome from its application in IBM would be a reduction in pro-inflammatory macrophages within muscle tissue, decreased secretion of cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β, improvement in proteostatic balance, and enhanced muscle contractility. However, further targeted preclinical studies in relevant IBM models and early-phase clinical evaluations in IBM patients are necessary to validate this approach, optimize dosing regimens, and fully assess the risk-to-benefit profile in the context of a chronic inflammatory myopathy. The overall strengths lie in the drug’s mechanistic specificity and prior safety data in other indications, while the key weaknesses concern the lack of direct evidence in muscle disease and potential adverse effects that might limit its long-term use in a non-malignant disorder (Boal et al., 2020; Wesolowski et al., 2019).

SMER28,"Proposal for SMER28

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SMER28 is a synthetic small molecule originally discovered through phenotypic screening designed to identify enhancers of autophagy that act independently of canonical mTOR inhibition (Floto et al., 2007). Its development involved screening chemical libraries for compounds that increased autophagic flux without eliciting the broad immunosuppressive effects commonly associated with rapamycin. The molecule belongs to a class of autophagy enhancers, specifically those that modulate autophagy via activation of the beclin-1/VPS34 complex, rather than through mTOR-dependent pathways (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022). The synthetic origins of SMER28 are well established; it is synthesized via multi-step organic pathways that have been optimized to yield an active scaffold, with accessible chemical modifications that allow for structure–activity relationship studies. This molecular scaffold is part of a broader class of compounds—SMERs (Small Molecule Enhancers of Rapamycin)—which have been used in numerous cellular and animal models to promote the autophagic clearance of misfolded or aggregate-prone proteins, and have been investigated across multiple disease indications including neurodegeneration (Sarkar et al., 2007; Floto et al., 2007).

Therapeutic History:
SMER28 has garnered attention primarily for its preclinical efficacy in cellular models of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Huntington’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. In cellular studies, SMER28 was shown to enhance autophagic flux and promote the clearance of aggregation-prone proteins such as mutant huntingtin and α-synuclein, with concomitant reductions in cell toxicity (Sarkar et al., 2007; Sarkar & Rubinsztein, 2008). In Drosophila models, the administration of SMER28 resulted in a significant decrease in mutant protein aggregation and associated neurodegeneration, thereby demonstrating its potential in mitigating proteotoxicity (Floto et al., 2007). Moreover, biochemical studies have shown that SMER28 can induce autophagy without altering mTOR signaling parameters, thus ensuring a targeted enhancement of autophagic pathways with minimal off-target immune suppression (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022; Koukourakis et al., 2018). Although the majority of the published work centers on neuronal and non-muscle models, there is emerging preclinical evidence in non-neuronal systems as well. For instance, a study investigating radioprotection in mouse bone marrow and liver demonstrated that SMER28 can protect normal tissues from radiation-induced damage through the activation of autophagy (Koukourakis et al., 2018). However, to date, there is no direct clinical or preclinical report that applies SMER28 in the context of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) or other protein aggregate myopathies. Its potential use in IBM remains a novel proposition that leverages its established mechanism of aggregate clearance in other disease models (Doulatov et al., 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism by which SMER28 exerts its effects centers on its ability to enhance autophagic flux independently of mTOR—a property that distinguishes it from rapamycin and its analogues. At the molecular level, SMER28 is reported to act by modulating the activity of the beclin-1/VPS34 complex. This complex is critical for the initiation of autophagosome formation since VPS34 is a class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase that generates PI(3)P, a lipid essential for nucleating the formation of autophagosomal membranes (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022; Sarkar et al., 2007). SMER28 enhances the assembly or activity of the VPS34 complex, thereby resulting in an increase in the formation of autophagosomes independent of conventional mTOR signaling. In addition, there is evidence that SMER28 directly interacts with components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, with studies demonstrating that it can inhibit specific isoforms of the catalytic subunit of PI3K (p110δ, with moderate effects on p110γ), further contributing to the attenuation of downstream mTOR signaling and growth factor responses (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022). This direct inhibition of PI3K contrasts with the indirect mTOR inhibition exerted by rapamycin, and it may account for additional cytostatic effects such as G1 phase cell cycle arrest observed in certain cell types (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022). Furthermore, recent structural studies suggest that SMER28 may also bind to the VCP/p97 complex, stimulating the D1 ATPase activity of VCP, which plays a dual role in governing both autophagic and proteasomal degradation of aggregate-prone proteins (Wrobel et al., 2023). This dual mechanism—i.e., enhancing autophagosome formation via beclin-1/VPS34 activation and promoting aggregate clearance through VCP-mediated proteostasis—provides a robust biochemical rationale for its efficacy in models of protein aggregation. The specificity for pathogenic protein aggregates is further highlighted by data demonstrating that SMER28 preferentially targets misfolded or mutant proteins while sparing their wild-type counterparts, a selectivity that is critical in avoiding undesired degradation of normal cellular proteins (Wrobel et al., 2022).

Expected Effect in IBM Myotubes:
The underlying hypothesis for repurposing SMER28 in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is based on its capacity to synergize with basal autophagy pathways in muscle cells to promote the clearance of pathological protein aggregates, specifically those contained within rimmed vacuoles. IBM is characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates, impaired autophagic flux, and consequent muscle fiber degeneration, which ultimately leads to contractile dysfunction of myotubes (Castets et al., 2016; Li et al., 2022). The expected therapeutic effect of SMER28 in IBM would be twofold. First, by enhancing autophagosome formation via activation of the beclin-1/VPS34 complex, SMER28 should increase the clearance rate of misfolded proteins and aggregates that accumulate in IBM. This is supported by preclinical evidence in neuronal models where SMER28 effectively reduced mutant protein aggregation and improved cellular viability (Sarkar et al., 2007; Floto et al., 2007). Second, in IBM myotubes—which express autophagy markers such as LC3 and p62 and exhibit impaired autophagic flux—SMER28 is anticipated to restore autophagy-mediated proteostasis thereby reducing the buildup of rimmed vacuole contents and, consequently, rescuing the contractile function of the muscle fibers. The biochemical rationale is further reinforced by studies demonstrating that other autophagy inducers have shown benefits in muscle disease models; for example, carbamazepine has been shown to activate autophagy via an mTOR-independent route, leading to improvements in muscle pathology in the SOD1-G93A mouse model (Zhang et al., 2018). Although that study focuses on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, it provides a conceptual parallel whereby mTOR-independent autophagy activation results in improved muscle function. Given that SMER28 acts through similar molecular mechanisms—enhancing autophagic flux via beclin-1/VPS34 and potentially modulating PI3K pathways—it is plausible that patient-derived IBM myotubes would show improved sarcomere integrity and contractile function upon treatment. Furthermore, the expression of key autophagy regulators in muscle cells, including beclin-1, ATG5/7, and VPS34, supports the notion that SMER28’s mechanism is operative in myotubes (Li et al., 2022; Pontifex, 2025). Thus, the expected effect is an improvement in myotube function through accelerated clearance of pathological protein aggregates and restoration of normal intracellular proteostasis.

Overall Evaluation:
SMER28 presents as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in Inclusion Body Myositis due to its unique mechanism of action and preclinical efficacy in models of protein aggregation. Its strengths include a well-established synthetic route and chemical scaffold, which provides avenues for further chemical optimization and structure–activity relationship studies (Floto et al., 2007; Koukourakis et al., 2018). The molecule’s ability to enhance autophagy independently of mTOR is particularly valuable given that mTOR inhibition can have broad systemic effects that are undesirable in chronic treatment settings. Instead, SMER28 specifically activates the beclin-1/VPS34 complex, thereby increasing autophagosomal biogenesis and promoting the clearance of toxic protein aggregates known to accumulate in IBM (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022; Sarkar et al., 2007). Furthermore, its capacity to directly inhibit the PI3K p110δ isoform and potentially modulate VCP/p97 activity provides a dual mechanism that may enhance both autophagic and proteasomal degradation pathways, ensuring a more comprehensive clearance of proteotoxic species (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022; Wrobel et al., 2023).

The translation of these mechanistic effects to the setting of IBM is compelling because the pathology of IBM revolves around the accumulation of rimmed vacuoles filled with aggregated proteins and the subsequent impairment of muscle fiber function (Castets et al., 2016; Li et al., 2022). By clearing these aggregates, SMER28 could not only restore cellular homeostasis but also potentially improve contractile function in patient-derived myotubes, addressing a key unmet need in IBM treatment. In addition, preliminary ADME and toxicity profiling in rodent models indicate that SMER28 is well tolerated at efficacious concentrations, although further detailed pharmacological profiling is necessary to ascertain its safety in long-term clinical use, especially in the context of chronic muscle diseases (Doulatov et al., 2017; Kirchenwitz et al., 2022).

However, several challenges and weaknesses must be considered. First, while extensive preclinical data exist in neuronal and non-muscle models, there is no direct evidence so far of SMER28’s efficacy in muscle cells, myotubes, or animal models of protein aggregate myopathies or Inclusion Body Myositis. Such proof-of-concept studies in muscle-specific models are essential before advancing SMER28 into clinical trials for IBM (Pontifex, 2025; Li et al., 2022). Second, although the mechanism of action is well characterized in terms of autophagy enhancement, the potential interplay with other cellular pathways active in muscle cells—such as those governing calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial dynamics, and sarcomeric organization—remains to be explored in detail. These interactions could influence the overall efficacy and safety profile of SMER28 in muscle tissue. Third, the dosage and potential cytostatic effects observed in some in vitro studies (as indicated by G1 cell cycle arrest in certain cell types) might raise concerns regarding long-term exposure in muscle cells, which are terminally differentiated and unlikely to proliferate but may nonetheless suffer functional alterations if the drug’s concentration is not carefully optimized (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022).

In summary, SMER28 offers several attractive features as a therapeutic candidate for IBM. Its mTOR-independent activation of autophagy via the beclin-1/VPS34 complex, combined with modulatory effects on PI3K and VCP/p97 pathways, provides a well-supported mechanistic basis for clearing pathogenic protein aggregates. These attributes, alongside preliminary evidence of efficacy in neurodegenerative models and advantageous synthetic features, justify its further investigation in IBM-specific preclinical models. However, the translational potential of SMER28 in IBM will hinge on rigorous studies in muscle cell models—including patient-derived myotubes—and appropriate animal models of protein aggregate myopathies to confirm that the compound can indeed rescue contractile dysfunction and restore muscle fiber homeostasis without inducing deleterious side effects. Given these considerations, SMER28 is a strong candidate warranting further preclinical evaluation as a repurposed drug for Inclusion Body Myositis, with its novel mTOR-independent mechanism representing a significant advance over existing autophagy modulators (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022; Vantaggiato et al., 2023; Wrobel et al., 2023).

RAD140 (Testolone),"Proposal for RAD140 (Testolone)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
RAD140, also known as Testolone, is a nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) originally discovered through extensive medicinal chemistry campaigns aimed at identifying compounds with potent anabolic activity and improved tissue selectivity compared to traditional anabolic steroids (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 1–3). Unlike natural androgens such as testosterone, which have widespread effects on multiple tissues and are associated with adverse side effects like prostate hypertrophy and cardiovascular issues, RAD140 belongs to the SARM class, which has been synthetically engineered to preferentially bind to androgen receptors (ARs) in skeletal muscle and bone while sparing tissues such as the prostate (Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 1–3; Budaya et al., 2024, pp. 1–2). The synthesis of RAD140 involved optimizing its chemical structure for high binding affinity (Ki ≈ 7 nM) and metabolic stability, as well as achieving good oral bioavailability as demonstrated in preclinical animal models, including studies in rats and nonhuman primates (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 3–5). SARMs as a class have historically been investigated for applications in muscle wasting, osteoporosis, and cachexia due to their ability to stimulate anabolic processes in muscle and bone via selective AR activation (Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 15–16; Budaya et al., 2024, pp. 2–4). This candidate’s synthetic origins and engineered selectivity underscore its potential as a repurposed therapeutic agent for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM), where the goal is to stimulate anabolic pathways in myotubes with minimal systemic androgenic side effects (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 1–3; Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 16–21).

Therapeutic History:
Over the past decade, compounds in the SARM category have undergone extensive preclinical evaluation and entered early‐phase clinical trials for various indications, such as muscle wasting associated with cancer cachexia, age‐related sarcopenia, and hypogonadism (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). RAD140 in particular has been evaluated in preclinical studies demonstrating significant anabolic activity on muscle tissue, including increased muscle mass and improved muscle fiber characteristics in rodent models, where it produced dose‐dependent increases in levator ani muscle weight with minimal androgenic stimulation of the prostate (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 5–6; Budaya et al., 2024, pp. 1–2). Although direct clinical data on RAD140’s effects in patients with Inclusion Body Myositis has not yet been reported, its ongoing Phase I trials in contexts such as cancer‐related muscle wasting, as well as its investigation under protocols registered (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017), suggest a growing body of evidence supporting its anabolic potential (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017). Historical evidence from other SARMs, which have demonstrated improvements in lean body mass, also serves to support RAD140’s therapeutic promise (Bhasin et al., 2023, pp. 1–2). Notably, while testosterone replacement therapies have been used in muscle wasting conditions, their undesirable side effects have driven the pursuit of SARMs like RAD140 which reduce the risk of androgenic adverse effects in tissues not targeted for anabolic effects (Dalton et al., 2014, pp. 1–2). Although RAD140 itself has not been extensively tested specifically for IBM, its preclinical profile in models of muscle atrophy and its favorable tissue selectivity suggest that it could be repurposed for IBM provided that further clinical development is undertaken (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 1–3; Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 16–21).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism by which RAD140 exerts its effects centers on its selective modulation of the androgen receptor. After oral administration, RAD140 is absorbed and circulates systemically, where it preferentially binds to androgen receptors expressed in skeletal muscle—promoting the recruitment of co‐activators necessary for the transcription of genes involved in muscle protein synthesis and cell growth, while exhibiting minimal activation in tissues such as the prostate (Miller et al., 2011, p. 6; Budaya et al., 2024, pp. 4–5). At the molecular level, RAD140 binds to the ligand‐binding domain (LBD) of the androgen receptor, inducing a conformational change that favors the recruitment of anabolic coactivators over corepressors, thereby triggering downstream signaling cascades such as the Akt/mTOR pathway that leads to myotube hypertrophy (Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 3–4; Miller et al., 2011, pp. 5–6). These anabolic effects are underscored by increased transcription of muscle‐specific genes that are pivotal in muscle fiber growth, enhanced contractility, and improved protein synthesis, while simultaneously avoiding conversion by 5α‐reductase into more potent androgenic metabolites—a major limitation of traditional testosterone therapy (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 1–3; Budaya et al., 2024, pp. 1–2). Furthermore, biochemical studies have demonstrated that RAD140’s binding profile results in a favorable anabolic to androgenic activity ratio, meaning that it robustly increases muscle mass without inducing typical androgenic side effects like prostate enlargement or virilization (Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 16–21; Ladna et al., 2023, pp. 1–2). This selective signaling involves not only the classical genomic activation via direct DNA binding but may also engage non‐genomic pathways that contribute to rapid signaling events within muscle cells, further potentiating anabolic responses (Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 6–8; Miller et al., 2011, pp. 5–6). Detailed preclinical assessments indicate that RAD140 significantly improves muscle fiber cross‐sectional area and overall muscle mass in animal models, results which are consistent with its hypothesized mechanism in promoting beneficial adaptations in muscle tissue (Puskas, 2022, pp. 7–11, 29–35).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the repurposing of RAD140 for the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis is that selective androgen receptor modulation will lead to enhanced anabolic signaling in IBM myotubes, thereby increasing muscle protein synthesis, improving muscle fiber size, and enhancing contractile function without the undesirable androgenic side effects typically associated with steroids. In cellular assays and preclinical models of muscle wasting, RAD140 is expected to stimulate pathways that are crucial for muscle hypertrophy by upregulating the transcription of specific myogenic genes and promoting the synthesis of contractile proteins (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 3–4; Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 15–16). In particular, the activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling cascade by RAD140 is anticipated to shift the balance of protein synthesis versus degradation in favor of anabolism, which is critical in reversing the muscle atrophy observed in IBM (Puskas, 2022, pp. 11–15; Bhasin et al., 2023, p. 7). Given that muscle fiber hypertrophy, especially of type I and type II fibers, is a key determinant of improved contractile strength and functional mobility in muscle wasting conditions, the anabolic effects induced by RAD140 could lead to clinically meaningful improvements in muscle performance in IBM patients (Feike et al., 2021, pp. 1–2; Miller et al., 2011, p. 6). Additionally, the fact that RAD140 does not undergo metabolic conversion into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or estradiol reduces the likelihood of provoking side effects such as prostate enlargement or gynecomastia, which supports its use in patient populations where such adverse effects are a major concern (Budaya et al., 2024, pp. 1–2; Dalton et al., 2014, pp. 1–2). Consequently, in the proposed assays using IBM patient‐derived myotubes, we expect RAD140 to enhance myogenic differentiation, improve cellular protein content, augment fiber cross‐sectional area, and ultimately lead to increased contractile force, thereby potentially ameliorating the progressive muscle weakness seen in IBM (Puskas, 2022, pp. 35–46; Bhasin et al., 2023, pp. 4–5). It is important to note, however, that while the anabolic potential of RAD140 is well supported by preclinical data, IBM is a complex disease with inflammatory and degenerative components that may not be fully addressed solely by anabolic stimulation (Tseng et al., 2018, pp. 15–18; Feike et al., 2021, pp. 10–11).

Overall Evaluation:
RAD140 (Testolone) presents a promising therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis due to its potent anabolic properties, tissue selectivity, and favorable pharmacokinetic profile. One of the primary strengths of RAD140 is its ability to selectively activate androgen receptors in muscle tissue, thereby promoting muscle hypertrophy and increasing protein synthesis without eliciting significant androgenic stimulation in tissues such as the prostate (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 1–3; Budaya et al., 2024, pp. 1–2). Its synthetic design, which includes modifications to enhance oral bioavailability and stability, makes it a practical candidate for chronic administration in populations suffering from muscle wasting disorders (Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 1–3; Miller et al., 2011, pp. 3–4). Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated that RAD140 increases muscle mass and improves muscle fiber characteristics in animal models, which supports the rationale that similar anabolic effects could be translated into improvements in muscle strength and function in IBM patients (Puskas, 2022, pp. 56–59; Miller et al., 2011, pp. 5–6). The expected mechanism—selective modulation of the androgen receptor leading to enhanced muscle protein synthesis via Akt/mTOR and other signaling cascades—is well characterized and provides a solid biochemical foundation for its repurposing in IBM (Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 16–21; Miller et al., 2011, p. 6).

Despite these strengths, several weaknesses and challenges should be acknowledged. First, while RAD140 has been extensively evaluated in preclinical settings and early‐phase clinical trials related to cancer cachexia and other muscle wasting conditions, there is limited direct clinical evidence regarding its efficacy in IBM specifically (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017). IBM is a complex inflammatory myopathy where muscle degeneration is not solely due to anabolic insufficiency but also involves chronic inflammation, protein aggregation, and degenerative processes that may not be fully reversed by anabolic stimulation alone (Bhasin et al., 2023, p. 7; Tseng et al., 2018, pp. 15–18). Therefore, while RAD140 may improve muscle mass and fiber size, its impact on overall muscle function and disease progression in IBM remains uncertain. Second, some concerns have been raised about potential hepatotoxic effects with SARMs in general, as evidenced by reports of liver enzyme elevations and cases of drug‐induced liver injury in recreational use, though these adverse events are mostly noted at supraphysiological doses or with unregulated preparations (Ladna et al., 2023, pp. 1–2; Vignali et al., 2023, pp. 2–3). Third, the translation of preclinical dosing to effective human regimens requires careful consideration, particularly since animal models do not completely recapitulate the multifactorial pathology of IBM, and dosing variability—as observed in some rodent studies—could influence therapeutic outcomes (Puskas, 2022, pp. 35–46; Miller et al., 2011, pp. 5–6). Finally, while the oral bioavailability and ease of administration are significant advantages, long‐term safety and efficacy data in the specific context of IBM are lacking, and additional studies, both preclinical in disease‐specific models and clinical trials, are necessary to fully validate its utility (Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 8–9; Feike et al., 2021, pp. 1–2).

In conclusion, RAD140 is an attractive candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for Inclusion Body Myositis due to its potent anabolic activity, favorable tissue selectivity, and convenient oral dosing. Its mechanism of selective androgen receptor modulation, which effectively enhances muscle protein synthesis and hypertrophy without extensive androgenic side effects, aligns well with the therapeutic needs of IBM where muscle wasting is a principal concern (Miller et al., 2011, pp. 3–4; Narayanan et al., 2018, pp. 16–21). However, the complex nature of IBM demands that future research addresses not only the anabolic capacity of RAD140 but also its effects on the inflammatory and degenerative aspects of the disease. Rigorous clinical trials are required to determine whether the promising preclinical results can be translated into meaningful clinical benefits in IBM patients, including improved muscle strength, function, and quality of life, while ensuring an acceptable long‐term safety profile (Bhasin et al., 2023, pp. 4–5; Puskas, 2022, pp. 29–35). Overall, while RAD140’s profile is compelling, its development for IBM will likely necessitate combination strategies or adjunct therapies to fully address the multifaceted pathology of the disease. Given these considerations, RAD140 holds potential for inclusion in our drug development portfolio, contingent upon further targeted research to validate both efficacy and safety in the context of inclusion body myositis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Miller et al., 2011, p. 6).

SRT1720,"Proposal for SRT1720

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SRT1720 is a synthetic small‐molecule activator designed to target SIRT1, a NAD⁺‐dependent deacetylase that plays a central role in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis, cellular metabolism, and proteostasis. Originally identified through a high‐throughput screening approach, SRT1720 emerged as a potent compound belonging to the class of sirtuin‐activating compounds (Villalba & Alcaín, 2012). As a chemically synthesized molecule unrelated in structure to natural polyphenols such as resveratrol, SRT1720 was developed to overcome the limitations of naturally derived SIRT1 activators, including low bioavailability and nonspecific off‐target effects. Its chemical design allows it to allosterically enhance the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 by binding to specific sites on the enzyme that favor a conformational state associated with high catalytic efficiency (Park et al., 2017). Over the past decade, compounds in this class have been explored in preclinical studies across diverse disease models, notably in metabolic syndromes and age‐related neurodegeneration, where enhancement of mitochondrial function and stimulation of autophagic pathways have been key endpoints. SRT1720 is thus positioned not only as a metabolic modulator but also as an agent with potential for addressing cellular proteostasis defects—a critical aspect in diseases such as Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) (Sorrentino et al., 2018).

Therapeutic History:
SRT1720 has been subjected to extensive preclinical evaluation primarily in models of metabolic dysfunction, obesity, and insulin resistance. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that SRT1720 improves insulin sensitivity, reduces blood glucose levels, promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, and enhances ATP production in tissues such as liver, brown adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle (Villalba & Alcaín, 2012; Funk, 2012). For example, rodent experiments revealed that treatment with SRT1720 restored mitochondrial respiration and increased mitochondrial DNA copy number—a surrogate marker for mitochondrial biogenesis—in renal proximal tubule cells following oxidative injury (Funk, 2012). Moreover, studies in muscle tissue have shown that SIRT1 activation is associated with improved oxidative metabolism and muscle performance, although direct investigations using SRT1720 in models of neuromuscular diseases, such as IBM, are limited (Giovarelli et al., 2025; Lee & Goldberg, 2013). While SRT1720 itself has not been comprehensively tested in IBM, related sirtuin activators like SRT2104 have demonstrated exercise mimetic effects and improvements in dystrophic muscle models, suggesting that modulating SIRT1 activity may yield beneficial outcomes in muscle diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and proteostasis defects (Giovarelli et al., 2025; DeBartolo et al., 2024). Thus, although prior clinical or veterinary uses of SRT1720 specifically in IBM have not been reported, the preclinical success in metabolic and neuromuscular contexts provides a rationale for repurposing this compound for IBM.

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism by which SRT1720 is thought to exert its therapeutic effects is via the allosteric activation of SIRT1. SIRT1 deacetylates a number of critical substrates, including the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, FOXO transcription factors, and p53, which collectively contribute to mitochondrial biogenesis, improved oxidative metabolism, and enhanced cellular stress resistance (Villalba & Alcaín, 2012; Vinciguerra et al., 2010). Biochemically, SRT1720 binds to SIRT1 in a substrate-dependent manner; early in vitro studies indicated that its activation is particularly evident when a bulky hydrophobic residue is adjacent to the acetylated lysine on the substrate, which facilitates an active closed conformation of SIRT1 (Park et al., 2017; Giovarelli et al., 2025). However, subsequent work has suggested that the metabolic improvements observed with SRT1720—such as enhanced glucose tolerance and mitochondrial function—may require mechanisms beyond direct SIRT1 activation. Specifically, SRT1720 appears to also stimulate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) through a SIRT1-independent pathway involving the inhibition of phosphodiesterases (especially PDE4), an increase in intracellular cAMP levels, and subsequent activation of Epac1 and Ca²⁺-dependent kinases (Park et al., 2017). This cascade results in enhanced mitochondrial gene expression via deacetylation of PGC-1α and stabilization of mitochondrial function. Consequently, the biochemical interaction of SRT1720 involves both direct SIRT1 activation—ensuring the deacetylation of key proteins that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis—and indirect AMPK activation, which collectively stimulate pathways pivotal to energy metabolism and proteostasis (Sorrentino et al., 2018; Park et al., 2017). In skeletal muscle, where SIRT1 is naturally upregulated by exercise to promote oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial adaptation (Pardo & Boriek, 2011), SRT1720’s mode of action is especially relevant. Its ability to deacetylate PGC-1α promotes the transcription of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis, while modulation of FOXO activity can directly impact autophagic processes, further contributing to the removal of damaged proteins and organelles (Lee & Goldberg, 2013; Pardo & Boriek, 2011).

Expected Effect:
Within the context of IBM myotubes, the hypothesis is that SRT1720 will activate SIRT1, which in turn will initiate a series of molecular events leading to improved mitochondrial biogenesis, upregulation of autophagy, and reduction of proteotoxic stress. In IBM, the accumulation of misfolded proteins and defective organelles is a key aspect of muscle pathology, often associated with impaired mitochondrial function and compromised proteostasis. By promoting the deacetylation of PGC-1α, SRT1720 is expected to enhance the transcription of mitochondrial genes, leading to an increased mitochondrial mass and improved respiratory capacity—both of which are critical for maintaining muscle energy homeostasis and force generation (Funk, 2012; Sorrentino et al., 2018). Furthermore, SIRT1 activation is known to stimulate autophagy by deacetylating core autophagy components as well as regulatory transcription factors such as FOXO, thereby facilitating the clearance of protein aggregates and damaged organelles (Park et al., 2017; Pardo & Boriek, 2011). This dual effect on mitochondrial quality control and autophagic flux is expected to lessen proteotoxic stress, preserve sarcomere integrity, and ultimately improve muscle contractility. In addition, the SIRT1-mediated reduction in inflammation—through inhibition of NF-κB signaling by deacetylating the p65 subunit—further supports a protective role against the chronic inflammatory milieu observed in IBM (Wan, 2021). Given that SIRT1 expression is critical for muscle regeneration and maintenance, as evidenced by enhanced satellite cell function and resistance to oxidative stress in muscle tissue (Myers et al., 2019; Pardo & Boriek, 2011), the expected effect of SRT1720 in IBM would be an overall improvement in muscle fiber quality and force generation. The combined activation of mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy pathways should, therefore, mitigate the pathological protein accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction that are hallmarks of IBM.

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating the potential of SRT1720 as a therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis, several strengths and weaknesses emerge based on the literature review.
One of the primary strengths of SRT1720 is its established preclinical profile as a potent activator of SIRT1. The molecular mechanisms by which SRT1720 exerts its effects—specifically, the allosteric activation of SIRT1 leading to deacetylation of key substrates such as PGC-1α and FOXO transcription factors—directly address pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in IBM, including mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy, and proteostasis deficits (Villalba & Alcaín, 2012; Park et al., 2017). The dual mechanism, which includes both direct SIRT1 activation and independent AMPK activation through inhibition of PDE4, provides a multilayered approach to enhancing muscle energy metabolism and autophagic clearance, processes that are critically impaired in IBM (Park et al., 2017; Sorrentino et al., 2018). Additionally, evidence from related SIRT1 activators such as SRT2104—where exercise mimetic effects and improvements in dystrophic muscle have been reported—supports the notion that SIRT1 modulation can yield beneficial outcomes in the context of muscle degenerative diseases (Giovarelli et al., 2025; DeBartolo et al., 2024).

Furthermore, SRT1720 shows favourable pharmacological properties in rodent models in terms of oral bioavailability and the ability to target muscle tissue, making it an attractive candidate for repurposing in IBM treatment (Sorrentino et al., 2018; Funk, 2012). The scientific rationale behind using a SIRT1 activator in IBM is compelling given that aging and muscle wasting are both associated with reduced SIRT1 activity, and that restoration of SIRT1 function has been linked to enhanced mitochondrial health and improved muscle regeneration (Pardo & Boriek, 2011; Vinciguerra et al., 2010).

On the other hand, several weaknesses and challenges also warrant attention. First, controversies exist regarding the specificity of SRT1720 as a direct SIRT1 activator. Some studies have raised concerns that its activation of SIRT1 is substrate-dependent and may only be appreciable in assays using modified substrates, potentially limiting its efficacy against native targets in vivo (Park et al., 2017; Unknown Reference). Second, SRT1720’s metabolic effects in preclinical models are, in part, mediated by SIRT1-independent activation of AMPK, thereby complicating the interpretation of its mechanism of action and raising questions regarding its true target specificity (Park et al., 2017).

Moreover, while SRT1720’s efficacy has been well documented in metabolic and acute injury models (for instance, in renal and cardiac contexts), there is a paucity of direct preclinical or clinical data supporting its use in neuromuscular diseases such as IBM (Giovarelli et al., 2025; Unknown Reference). IBM is a distinct and complex myopathy with a multifactorial etiology involving not only mitochondrial dysfunction but also inflammatory and degenerative components that may not be fully addressed by SIRT1 activation alone. Therefore, extrapolation from other disease models, while encouraging, necessitates further targeted investigations in IBM-specific cellular and animal models.

Additionally, concerns regarding long-term safety and the potential for off-target effects remain. Although rodent pharmacokinetic studies suggest that SRT1720 is orally bioavailable and capable of crossing cellular membranes to reach intracellular SIRT1 targets (Funk, 2012), the translation of these findings to the human clinical scenario is not straightforward. The therapeutic window, dosing regimen, and sustained efficacy of SRT1720 in muscle tissue—particularly in the context of a chronic disease like IBM that may require long-term treatment—are as yet undefined.

In summary, SRT1720 is a promising therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on its ability to activate SIRT1 and, consequently, stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis, enhance autophagy, and improve proteostasis—all processes that are disrupted in IBM. Its synthetic origin and well-characterized preclinical performance in metabolic and stress-injury models underline its potential benefits. However, challenges including controversies about its direct mechanism of action, the dual activation of AMPK in a SIRT1‐independent manner, and the current lack of direct preclinical data in IBM necessitate rigorous further investigations. Future research should focus on establishing robust in vitro and in vivo models of IBM to evaluate SRT1720’s specific effects on muscle mitochondrial function, autophagic flux, and sarcomere integrity, as well as comprehensive pharmacokinetic and safety studies to support clinical translation. Overall, while strong in concept, SRT1720’s application to IBM requires careful experimental validation and optimization before it can be confidently advanced as a therapeutic option for this challenging neuromuscular disease (Sorrentino et al., 2018; Pardo & Boriek, 2011; Wan, 2021).

IU1,"Proposal for IU1

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
IU1 is a small-molecule inhibitor originally discovered via high‐throughput screening efforts as a selective compound that targets USP14, a proteasome‐associated deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) (Chakraborty et al., 2018; LaPlante & Zhang, 2021). USP14 normally trims polyubiquitin chains from proteins destined for degradation by the 26S proteasome, thereby delaying their proteolysis. IU1 was chemically developed as a tool compound in academic and preclinical research to reverse this regulatory “brake” on the proteasome; it is a member of the class of small-molecule DUB inhibitors that are designed to enhance proteasome activity by specifically blocking USP14 activity (Chakraborty et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2024). The synthesis of IU1 and its derivatives (such as IU1-47, 1B10, and IU1-248) involved medicinal chemistry approaches that optimized the parent structure to increase potency, selectivity, and membrane permeability (LaPlante & Zhang, 2021; Qin et al., 2024). IU1 belongs to a distinct chemical class of non-covalent, allosteric inhibitors that do not bind to the catalytic cysteine directly but rather interact with regulatory loops near the catalytic site, thereby maintaining USP14 in its autoinhibited conformation (Chakraborty et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2024). Notably, this compound’s origin as a research tool in neurodegenerative disease models and cancer-related studies positions it within a chemical and mechanistic framework that has been widely used to probe the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) in various pathological contexts.

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of IU1 and its chemical class is marked primarily by preclinical studies aimed at modulating protein homeostasis through enhancement of the proteasomal degradation machinery. In cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson’s disease, inhibition of USP14 by IU1 has been shown to stimulate proteasome activity, thereby promoting the clearance of misfolded or aggregation-prone proteins (Chakraborty et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2024). For example, in studies using human neuroblastoma cells and Drosophila models of impaired mitophagy, treatment with IU1 not only increased degradation of ubiquitinated proteins but also improved mitochondrial function and locomotor performance—findings that are considered promising for diseases associated with protein aggregation (Chakraborty et al., 2018). Additionally, in cancer cell models, IU1 has demonstrated the ability to restrain proliferation and migration by interfering with USP14-mediated protein stabilization processes (Srinivasan et al., 2023). Although there is robust experimental evidence supporting the use of USP14 inhibitors in neurodegenerative and oncological contexts, direct clinical or preclinical studies using IU1 in Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) or in muscle-related protein aggregation disorders have not been conclusively reported (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, the mechanistic rationale derived from neurodegenerative models—with their shared pathological features such as TDP-43 protein aggregation and impaired proteostasis—is considered highly pertinent to IBM (Rinaldi et al., 2016; Qin et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, IU1 functions by binding to USP14 in a manner that does not directly compete with the catalytic substrate at the enzyme’s active site but rather targets an allosteric site located approximately 8.3 Å from the catalytic cysteine (Chakraborty et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2024). By stabilizing the autoinhibited conformation of USP14, IU1 prevents the enzyme from removing ubiquitin chains from proteins destined for degradation by the proteasome. Under normal conditions, USP14 temporarily rescues polyubiquitinated substrates by cleaving off ubiquitin chains, thereby slowing their entry into the 20S core particle and effectively reducing the overall proteolytic throughput of the UPS (LaPlante & Zhang, 2021). When IU1 inhibits this deubiquitinating activity, substrates remain polyubiquitinated for longer, which increases their recognition by the proteasome and accelerates their turnover. In various preclinical models, this enhanced proteasome activity has been shown to lead to accelerated degradation of aggregation-prone proteins, such as phosphorylated Tau and TDP-43, both of which accumulate in neurodegenerative diseases and are implicated in IBM pathology (Qin et al., 2024; VerPlank et al., 2018). The chemical interactions involve π-π stacking interactions between the benzene ring of IU1 and key protein residues (e.g., H426, Y436, and Y476 in USP14), as well as hydrophobic contacts contributed by modifications on the pyrrole or pyrrolidine rings in its analogs (Qin et al., 2024). This detailed mechanism reinforces how selective USP14 inhibition can release the proteasome from its naturally inhibitory checkpoints, thus facilitating the degradation of proteins that, when accumulated, contribute to cellular dysfunction.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis under evaluation posits that inhibition of USP14 by IU1 will enhance proteasome activity in IBM myotubes, thereby accelerating the degradation of ubiquitinated TDP-43 species, reducing the pathological aggregates, and ultimately increasing contractile force and muscle function. In IBM, misfolding and aggregation of proteins such as TDP-43 have been observed and are considered central to disease pathology (Rinaldi et al., 2016; Tran & Lee, 2022). By promoting proteasome activity through USP14 inhibition, IU1 is expected to counter these proteostatic defects. Evidence from neurodegenerative models shows that when USP14 is inhibited with IU1, proteasome activity increases and this results in improved clearance of aberrant proteins, enhanced autophagy flux, and restoration of mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis (Chakraborty et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2024). Similarly, experiments in cancer cell models indicate that IU1 enhances total protein ubiquitination, thereby facilitating the degradation of oncogenic proteins, which supports the general concept that the drug acts to reduce the levels of proteins that are normally stabilized by USP14 (Srinivasan et al., 2023). If applied to IBM myotubes, the expectation is that IU1 will lead to a decrease in the burden of ubiquitinated TDP-43 aggregates, which have been linked to decreased muscle cell contractility and muscle weakness. Given that proteasome activation is known to be beneficial in models of proteotoxic stress, enhanced clearance of aggregates could improve cellular contractile function and muscle fiber health. Preclinical indications of IU1’s ability to penetrate muscle tissue and its tolerability in murine models further support the potential for therapeutic benefit in IBM (Ma et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
IU1 represents a promising therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on its well-defined mechanistic action and preclinical evidence from related fields. Its strength lies in its ability to modulate the UPS by selectively inhibiting USP14 and thereby enhancing proteasomal degradation of aggregated proteins. The compound has demonstrated efficacy in increasing proteasome activity, improving clearance of misfolded proteins, and promoting autophagic flux in both neuronal and cancer cell models (Chakraborty et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2024; Srinivasan et al., 2023). This biochemistry is highly relevant to IBM pathology, in which the accumulation of ubiquitinated TDP-43 aggregates contributes to muscle dysfunction (Rinaldi et al., 2016; Tran & Lee, 2022). The rational design and subsequent chemical optimization of IU1, including generation of analogs with improved potency and membrane permeability, underlines its developmental feasibility (LaPlante & Zhang, 2021; Qin et al., 2024).

However, several weaknesses and challenges need careful consideration. First, while the mechanistic data from neurodegenerative and oncological models are robust, there is a paucity of direct experimental evidence showing IU1’s therapeutic efficacy in IBM or in muscle tissue specifically (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Wing, 2013). Muscle tissue presents a unique microenvironment, and the pharmacodynamics in myotubes might differ from those observed in neuronal or cancer cell models. Second, some studies hint at potential neurotoxicity of IU1 at lower concentrations, which raises concerns about dose optimization and off-target effects if similar toxicities occur in muscle or other tissues (Qin et al., 2024). Third, while preliminary ADME studies in mice suggest muscle penetration, the detailed pharmacokinetic profile, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination in muscle tissue, must be rigorously evaluated in the context of IBM, a condition that may involve altered muscle metabolism (Ma et al., 2024). Moreover, the design of IU1 as a research tool means that its transition from preclinical investigations to a clinically validated drug candidate will require extensive further optimization to ensure both efficacy and safety in long-term administration in patients with IBM.

Another critical factor is the therapeutic window; since USP14 plays an important role in normal protein homeostasis, its complete inhibition might risk perturbing normal cellular functions, particularly in highly metabolic tissues such as muscle (Chakraborty et al., 2018). The balance between enhancing proteasomal clearance of aggregated proteins and preserving sufficient DUB activity for normal cell functions is delicate and will necessitate careful titration of the dose. Additionally, while IU1’s enhancement of proteasome activity is mechanistically sound, IBM pathology is multifactorial, involving not only protein aggregation but also inflammatory components, mitochondrial dysfunction, and other cellular stress responses. Therefore, combination therapies or adjunct treatments may be needed rather than relying solely on USP14 inhibition.

In summary, IU1 as a candidate for IBM holds significant promise due to its defined mechanism of increasing proteasomal throughput and auto-activating clearance pathways that are crucial in removing toxic protein aggregates such as TDP-43. The compound’s origins in neurodegenerative disease research, along with evidence from cancer cell studies that demonstrate enhanced protein degradation, support the hypothesis that targeting USP14 can ameliorate key pathological features of IBM (Chakraborty et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2024; Srinivasan et al., 2023). Yet, the leap from these models to effective treatment of muscle diseases like IBM will require additional detailed preclinical studies focused on muscle-specific models and careful assessment of potential toxicities and pharmacokinetic properties in muscle tissue. Given IU1’s ability to modulate the ubiquitin–proteasome system, it remains a highly attractive candidate, particularly as a repurposed drug to target proteostasis defects in IBM. An intensive investigation into its effects on TDP-43 aggregates in IBM myotubes, coupled with functional assays measuring muscle contractility and longitudinal safety studies, will be critical in determining whether IU1 can be developed into a clinically viable therapeutic option for Inclusion Body Myositis (Chakraborty et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall, the strengths of IU1 include its selective inhibition of USP14, a mechanism that has been robustly demonstrated to enhance proteasomal degradation and clear aggregation-prone proteins, as well as its chemical tractability and prior optimization to improve potency and membrane permeability. Its preclinical record in neurodegeneration and cancer models provides a solid mechanistic basis for expecting similar benefits in IBM. Conversely, its weaknesses involve the lack of direct data in muscle disease models, potential safety concerns that may arise from perturbing normal proteostasis balance, and the need for comprehensive pharmacokinetic evaluation in muscle tissue. The development pathway for IU1 toward repurposing for IBM will hence hinge on establishing definitive experimental evidence that improved proteasome activity in IBM myotubes translates into meaningful reductions in pathological TDP-43 aggregates and, importantly, an increase in muscle contractile function that could ameliorate the clinical symptoms of IBM (Rinaldi et al., 2016; Tran & Lee, 2022).

Celastrol,"Proposal for Celastrol

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Celastrol is a natural quinone methide triterpenoid originally isolated from the Thunder God Vine (Tripterygium wilfordii), a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine for its anti‐inflammatory properties. This compound belongs to the class of triterpenoids, which have been extensively investigated for their broad spectrum of biological activities including anti‐inflammatory, anti‐oxidant, and cytoprotective effects. Celastrol was discovered using traditional extraction methods from medicinal plants and further characterized for its potent pharmacological properties. Its chemical structure, defined by a quinone methide moiety, is critical for its reactivity toward nucleophilic sites on proteins, thereby enabling it to modulate stress-responsive pathways. This compound has been mainly synthesized in its natural form for biochemical assays, and structural analogues have been developed to probe its mechanism of action and optimize its pharmacodynamic properties (Westerheide et al., 2004; Trott et al., 2008).

Therapeutic History:
Celastrol has a rich history in preclinical research for its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. In traditional settings, extracts of Tripterygium wilfordii have been used to treat inflammatory conditions, and celastrol is now recognized as one of its key active components. Preclinically, celastrol has been evaluated in a variety of disease models including autoimmune disorders, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, and several cancer models due to its ability to inhibit key inflammatory pathways like NF-κB as well as its capacity to induce a heat shock response (Westerheide et al., 2004; Vilaboa & Voellmy, 2023). However, searches of clinical trial databases have failed to reveal any registered studies evaluating celastrol in the treatment of Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) or related muscle diseases, indicating that while its use in inflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions has been explored, there is no direct clinical precedent for its application in IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In muscular dystrophy contexts and models of inflammatory muscle disease, such as dysferlinopathies, celastrol has been investigated primarily for its anti-inflammatory effects through NF-κB inhibition, though improvements in muscle function were not consistently observed (Dillingham et al., 2015; Ichim-Moreno et al., 2010). These studies suggest that celastrol’s beneficial effects on muscle may require modulation beyond inflammation alone, with a strong emphasis now on its ability to induce a heat shock response that could facilitate proteostasis in diseased muscle tissue.

Mechanism of Action:
Celastrol’s mechanism of action is multifaceted, reflecting its activity at several molecular targets. A central aspect of its activity is the robust activation of the heat shock response (HSR) mediated by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). Celastrol achieves this by covalently modifying cysteine residues on target proteins, which initiates HSF1 hyperphosphorylation and nuclear accumulation leading to the increased transcription of heat shock proteins (HSPs) such as HSP70 and HSP27. The resulting upregulation of these chaperones is critical for enhancing the cellular capacity for protein folding and facilitating the clearance of misfolded or aggregated proteins—a process particularly relevant to proteinopathies such as IBM, where TDP-43 aggregation is a hallmark (Trott et al., 2008; Westerheide et al., 2004). At the molecular level, celastrol also exhibits inhibitory activity on HSP90, which is known to form a complex with HSF1 under non-stressed conditions. By disrupting this complex, celastrol effectively unleashes HSF1 to drive the HSR. In addition to these effects, celastrol modulates inflammatory pathways; it inhibits NF-κB signaling by interfering with IκB kinase activation and the subsequent phosphorylation of IκBα, thereby reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This anti-inflammatory action compliments its induction of cytoprotective HSPs and contributes to its overall therapeutic profile (Klaic et al., 2012; Westerheide et al., 2004). In muscle cells, the activation of HSP70 specifically has been associated with protection against atrophy and improved myofiber integrity, as evidenced by studies showing that HSP70 overexpression can rescue myotube diameter and prevent protein degradation pathways such as those mediated by FoxO3 (Park & Park, 2015). Thus, celastrol’s ability to upregulate crucial molecular chaperones provides a direct mechanistic rationale for its proposed use in IBM, aiming to clear TDP-43 aggregates and restore sarcomere structure and contractile function.

Expected Effect:
Based on its well-documented mechanism of action, celastrol is expected to upregulate the HSF1-dependent heat shock response in IBM myotubes, leading to increased levels of HSP70 and HSP27. This upregulation is anticipated to enhance the cellular machinery responsible for maintaining protein homeostasis by facilitating the refolding or degradation of misfolded proteins. In the context of IBM, where TDP-43 aggregation disrupts normal muscle fiber architecture and impairs contractile function, an increase in HSP70 could promote the clearance of these toxic aggregates, thereby restoring sarcomere integrity and improving muscle function (Westerheide et al., 2004; Schiavone et al., 2021). Additionally, by inhibiting NF-κB signaling, celastrol may reduce chronic muscle inflammation—a critical factor that exacerbates muscle degeneration in IBM—and this dual action could synergistically support muscle repair and regeneration. In vitro studies in muscle cells have shown that restoration of HSP activity can counteract atrophic processes by modulating signaling pathways including FoxO3, which is known to drive the expression of muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases involved in protein degradation (Park & Park, 2015; Brinkmeier & Ohlendieck, 2014). Consequently, in an assay using IBM myotubes, celastrol is expected not only to diminish the burden of misfolded TDP-43 but also to improve myotube fusion, enhance contractile function, and restore overall muscle architecture by promoting a favorable proteostatic environment.

Overall Evaluation:
Celastrol represents a promising repurposed drug candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis based on its multifaceted pharmacological profile. Its natural origin and extensive preclinical history underscore its potential as an HSR inducer with robust anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. One of the major strengths of celastrol lies in its ability to activate HSF1 and thereby upregulate HSP70 and HSP27, which are critical for maintaining proteostasis and may facilitate the clearance of pathogenic protein aggregates such as TDP-43. The biochemical evidence supporting its mechanism indicates that celastrol can concurrently modulate proteostasis and inflammatory pathways, which is highly relevant given the dual pathology observed in IBM—namely, protein aggregation and muscle inflammation (Westerheide et al., 2004; Trott et al., 2008; Schiavone et al., 2021). Furthermore, preclinical studies in other muscle disease and neurodegenerative models have highlighted its potential benefits in reducing protein aggregation and improving muscle function, as well as its activity in modulating NF-κB signaling, which is particularly beneficial in inflammatory conditions (Vilaboa & Voellmy, 2023; Dillingham et al., 2015).

Nonetheless, several challenges and limitations must also be considered. Despite its promising mechanism, the therapeutic history of celastrol in muscle disease models has been mixed; while it shows potent anti-inflammatory effects and HSR induction in vitro, some in vivo studies, particularly those involving dysferlin-deficient mice, have failed to demonstrate improvements in muscle function despite reductions in inflammatory markers (Dillingham et al., 2015). This suggests that its benefits may be context-dependent, and successful translation to IBM will require careful optimization of dosing, formulation, and delivery—especially given celastrol’s narrow therapeutic window and potential toxicities at higher doses. Additionally, current clinical trial databases have not documented any trials specifically targeting IBM with celastrol, underscoring the need for more rigorous preclinical investigations to thoroughly evaluate its efficacy and safety in this particular context (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Another consideration is the pharmacokinetic profile of celastrol. Although preclinical studies suggest it is orally bioavailable in nanoformulations and is well tolerated in rodent models at sub-micromolar concentrations, detailed information regarding its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) in humans remains limited (Chan et al., 2021). This necessitates further pharmacological and toxicological studies to validate its suitability for chronic treatment in IBM patients, who may require long-term therapy. Moreover, while the induction of heat shock proteins is a compelling therapeutic strategy, it remains to be established whether the level of upregulation achieved by celastrol will be sufficient to overcome the proteostatic challenges characteristic of IBM muscle tissue, including the clearance of TDP-43 aggregates and restoration of sarcomere organization.

In summary, celastrol offers a mechanistically sound approach for addressing two major pathological features of IBM—protein aggregation and inflammation—through its dual action as an HSF1 inducer and NF-κB inhibitor. Its natural origin, historical use in traditional medicine, and demonstrated activity in preclinical models lend credibility to its potential repurposing for IBM. However, the translation of these findings into a clinically effective therapy for IBM will require further validation through comprehensive in vivo studies, optimized formulation strategies to enhance bioavailability and reduce off-target toxicities, and eventual clinical trials to ascertain its therapeutic efficacy and safety in patients. The strengths of celastrol include its robust activation of cytoprotective pathways and its ability to modulate multiple disease-relevant signaling cascades, while its weaknesses lie in the current gap in in vivo evidence for muscle function improvement and the need for better pharmacokinetic and toxicological data (Westerheide et al., 2004; Park & Park, 2015; Dillingham et al., 2015). Overall, while celastrol represents a promising candidate for drug repurposing in IBM based on its molecular mechanisms and preclinical potential, further targeted research is essential to address these challenges before it can be advanced as a therapeutic for Inclusion Body Myositis.

MLN120B,"Proposal for MLN120B

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MLN120B is a synthetic small-molecule inhibitor that belongs to the IKKβ inhibitors class. It was developed through medicinal chemistry efforts involving optimization of inhibitor scaffolds—originating from a β‐carboline series—to yield a compound with potent and selective ATP‐competitive inhibition of IKKβ kinase activity (Dang, 2010; Karin, Yamamoto, & Wang, 2004). As an IKKβ inhibitor, MLN120B is designed to interfere with the catalytic domain of IKKβ, preventing phosphorylation of IκB proteins. This interruption stabilizes IκB, thereby sequestering NF-κB in the cytosol and preventing its nuclear translocation and subsequent transcription of inflammatory and catabolic genes. MLN120B’s synthetic origin implies that its structure and pharmacologic properties—such as oral bioavailability and adequate rodent pharmacokinetics—were optimized for targeting inflammatory pathways, which has been of interest in multiple inflammatory and neoplastic disease models (Llona-Minguez, Baiget, & Mackay, 2013; Prescott & Cook, 2018).

Therapeutic History:
IKKβ inhibitors as a drug class have a robust preclinical history, with compounds such as MLN120B being extensively validated in inflammatory disease models, cancer cell lines, and animal models of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple myeloma, and even lung inflammation. For example, preclinical studies demonstrated that MLN120B effectively blocks NF-κB activation in several in vitro models and animal models of inflammatory diseases—where inhibition of IKKβ leads to reduced proinflammatory cytokine production and minimized tissue destruction (Dang, 2010; Prescott & Cook, 2018). Despite these encouraging findings in inflammatory settings, MLN120B has not been formally evaluated in clinical trials for Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM). The literature search on ClinicalTrials.gov confirms that there is no clinical trial registered that uses MLN120B or selective IKKβ inhibitors directly for IBM (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nevertheless, the documented anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic properties of this class provide an appealing rationale for repurposing such compounds for IBM, a disease marked by inflammatory myopathy and muscle degeneration (Creus, De Paepe, & De Bleecker, 2009; Rayavarapu et al., 2013).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of MLN120B is centered on its role as an ATP-competitive inhibitor of IKKβ. IKKβ is a catalytic subunit within the IκB kinase (IKK) complex that, upon activation by proinflammatory stimuli such as TNF-α, phosphorylates the inhibitory IκB proteins bound to NF-κB transcription factors. Phosphorylation marks IκB for ubiquitination and degradation, releasing NF-κB—predominantly in the form of p65/p50 heterodimers—to translocate into the nucleus and drive the transcription of proinflammatory, pro-survival, and muscle atrophy-related genes (Karin, 2006; Li, Malhotra, & Kumar, 2008). MLN120B, by competitively inhibiting the ATP binding site on IKKβ, prevents this phosphorylation event. This blockade results in a sustained association of IκB with NF-κB, thereby attenuating the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and reducing its transcriptional activity. Importantly, NF-κB activation is known to stimulate the expression of muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as MuRF-1 and Atrogin-1, which mediate proteasomal degradation and are central to muscle wasting processes (Li, Malhotra, & Kumar, 2008; Monici et al., 2003). Consequently, MLN120B is expected to suppress these downstream atrophy pathways by blocking the canonical NF-κB pathway. The molecular specificity of MLN120B has been compared with other IKKβ inhibitors such as BMS-345541 and IKK VII in muscle assays, and it has shown promising selectivity owing to its minimal off-target effects on other kinases (Dang, 2010; Karin, Yamamoto, & Wang, 2004).

Expected Effect:
Based on preclinical evidence in various inflammatory models and robust in vitro assays using muscle cells, the expected effect of MLN120B in the context of IBM is twofold. First, by inhibiting IKKβ, MLN120B should block the NF-κB–dependent transcription of key atrophy genes such as MuRF-1 and Atrogin-1. These ubiquitin ligases have been directly implicated in muscle protein degradation and the progression of muscle wasting in conditions like IBM (Li, Malhotra, & Kumar, 2008; Brunn et al., 2012). Studies using muscle-specific in vitro assays—such as those utilizing NF-κB-driven luciferase reporters in C2C12 myotubes—have shown that NF-κB inhibitors can inhibit nuclear translocation of NF-κB and rescue sarcomere integrity in differentiated muscle cells (Baudy et al., 2009). Second, by preventing the chronic, low-grade inflammation observed in IBM, MLN120B is expected to preserve contractile function by mitigating inflammatory cytokine production (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β) that otherwise exacerbates muscle degeneration (Belova et al., 2017; Creus, De Paepe, & De Bleecker, 2009). The overall hypothesis is that selective IKKβ inhibition in IBM myotubes will not only reduce the expression of atrophy markers but also maintain the overall muscle structure and contractile properties, likely resulting in improved muscle strength and function.

Overall Evaluation:
The rationale for repurposing MLN120B as a therapeutic candidate for Inclusion Body Myositis is supported by several strengths, although there are key challenges to be addressed. One major strength is the well-defined mechanistic basis of MLN120B, which directly targets IKKβ, a central node in the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway responsible for mediating inflammatory responses and muscle atrophy (Karin, 2006; Li, Malhotra, & Kumar, 2008). The ATP-competitive mode of inhibition provides molecular specificity, which is critical in reducing unintended side effects. Preclinical studies in models of inflammatory diseases have shown robust anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic effects with IKKβ inhibitors, lending credence to the idea that these same mechanisms could be beneficial in IBM (Prescott & Cook, 2018; Dang, 2010). Moreover, in vitro data from muscle-specific assays demonstrate that NF-κB inhibition can rescue sarcomere integrity and prevent the upregulation of atrophy-associated ubiquitin ligases in myotubes (Baudy et al., 2009; Li, Malhotra, & Kumar, 2008).

On the other hand, there are several weaknesses and challenges that must be acknowledged. Despite promising preclinical efficacy in other inflammatory contexts, MLN120B has not yet been directly applied or clinically evaluated in the context of IBM. The absence of clinical or veterinary studies in IBM means that its efficacy in muscle-specific pathologies remains theoretical and will require extensive preclinical validation using muscle cell models and animal models that recapitulate the IBM phenotype (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while selective IKKβ inhibition is beneficial for blocking canonical NF-κB signaling, emerging evidence suggests that in certain contexts IKKβ inhibitors might induce compensatory activation of noncanonical NF-κB pathways or lead to paradoxical upregulation of some catabolic mediators (Belova et al., 2017; Hideshima et al., 2009). This raises the possibility that MLN120B’s effects on muscle cells might be more complex than simply inhibiting atrophy gene expression. There is also the inherent challenge of systemic immunomodulation: while suppressing NF-κB can ameliorate chronic inflammation, NF-κB also plays critical roles in cell survival and immune defense. Therefore, long-term systemic IKKβ inhibition could carry risks such as impaired host-defense mechanisms or adverse effects on muscle regeneration (Karin, Yamamoto, & Wang, 2004; Prescott & Cook, 2018).

Another potential weakness lies in the translational gap between rodent models and human muscle pathology. Although MLN120B has known rodent pharmacokinetics and efficacy in models of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple myeloma (Dang, 2010; Prescott & Cook, 2018), the translation of these effects to the muscle-specific pathology of IBM—characterized by chronic inflammation, protein aggregation, and degenerative myopathy—remains untested. The cellular environment in IBM muscle, including the interplay between inflammatory infiltrates and myotubes, is highly complex, and it remains to be determined if MLN120B’s inhibition of NF-κB will be sufficient to preserve contractile function over the long term in this context (Creus, De Paepe, & De Bleecker, 2009; Li, Malhotra, & Kumar, 2008).

In summary, MLN120B stands as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in Inclusion Body Myositis due to its potent and selective IKKβ inhibition, which directly targets a key driver of NF-κB activation implicated in muscle atrophy and inflammatory signaling. Its established anti-inflammatory efficacy in preclinical models of arthritis and cancer, alongside its favorable rodent pharmacokinetics, supports the hypothesis that MLN120B could block NF-κB–mediated transcription of atrophy genes in IBM myotubes, thereby preventing the upregulation of MuRF-1 and Atrogin-1 and preserving contractile function (Karin, 2006; Li, Malhotra, & Kumar, 2008; Prescott & Cook, 2018). However, significant challenges remain, including the need for dedicated muscle-specific preclinical studies, assessment of potential compensatory pathways, and careful consideration of safety and immune function. Overall, while the mechanistic rationale and preclinical data are encouraging, further targeted studies are required to validate MLN120B’s efficacy and safety in IBM before it can be advanced as a clinical candidate for this debilitating muscle disease (Baudy et al., 2009; Creus, De Paepe, & De Bleecker, 2009).
