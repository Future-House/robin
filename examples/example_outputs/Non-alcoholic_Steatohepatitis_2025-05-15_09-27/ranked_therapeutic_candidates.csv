"Resmetirom (MGL-3196, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals)","Proposal for Resmetirom (MGL-3196, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Resmetirom, also known by its research code MGL-3196 and developed by Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, is a synthetic small-molecule agent that belongs to the class of selective thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRβ) agonists. Its development originated from efforts to harness the metabolic benefits of thyroid hormone signaling specifically in the liver while minimizing the adverse systemic effects associated with non-selective thyroid hormone therapies (Alkhouri, 2020). The compound was designed using state-of-the-art medicinal chemistry and high-throughput screening strategies to achieve high selectivity for the THRβ isoform, which is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes, by achieving an approximate 28-fold selectivity over THRα (Levien & Baker, 2025). While early candidates in this class emerged from investigations aimed at treating dyslipidemia and obesity, Resmetirom stands out because of its ability to drive mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and reduce hepatic triglyceride levels. In the discovery phase, its synthesis was driven by the need to develop a receptor subtype–selective modulator that could exploit the liver’s natural reliance on THRβ for regulating cholesterol metabolism, bile acid synthesis, and mitochondrial biogenesis. This synthetic approach underlines the compound’s natural origins in classical thyroid hormone biology while taking advantage of modern drug design strategies to avoid systemic thyrotoxicosis and cardiorespiratory toxicity (Alkhouri, 2020; Lin et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
The conceptual basis of employing thyroid hormone mimetics to treat metabolic liver diseases has a long-standing precedent in preclinical biochemical and animal model studies. Early studies using non-selective thyroid hormones, such as T3, demonstrated potent effects in decreasing hepatic steatosis by reducing lipogenic gene expression and upregulating mitochondrial β-oxidation enzymes, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT1) (Kowalik, Columbano, & Perra, 2018). However, the clinical utility of native thyroid hormones was hampered by off-target effects, such as tachycardia, bone loss, and cardiac hypertrophy, primarily mediated by THRα. To overcome these limitations, selective THRβ agonists were developed, and among them, Resmetirom has been extensively explored in both Phase II and Phase III clinical trials in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) as well as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Clinical studies, such as those identified by ClinicalTrials.gov (2016; 2019a; 2019b; 2021), have demonstrated that Resmetirom not only reduces hepatic fat content as measured by imaging techniques (MRI-PDFF) but also improves liver enzymes and noninvasive fibrosis biomarkers (Hasan et al., 2025; Karim & Bansal, 2023). Its history in clinical development solidifies its potential role in repurposing and treating NASH—a disease with high unmet need and no approved pharmacologic interventions prior to its investigation. Moreover, its use in dyslipidemia provided preliminary evidence of favorable lipid-lowering effects and metabolic improvements, which further supported the rationale to evaluate it for NASH, a condition characterized by severe steatosis, hepatocellular inflammation, and progressive fibrosis (Karim & Bansal, 2023; Harrison et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
Resmetirom’s mechanism of action is driven by its selective activation of THRβ in hepatocytes. At the molecular level, once Resmetirom binds to THRβ, it induces conformational changes that promote recruitment of coactivators and subsequent transcriptional upregulation of target genes. These target genes include those involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation pathways, notably CPT1A (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A) and DIO1 (type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase) (Sinha et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2022). CPT1A is critical for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria, thereby enabling β-oxidation, while DIO1 catalyzes the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to the active triiodothyronine (T3), further sustaining thyroid hormone signaling within the liver. This dual upregulation leads to an enhanced mitochondrial metabolic rate, increased oxygen consumption, and improved fatty acid catabolism. Preclinical studies in animal models of high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis have shown that treatment with Resmetirom leads to significant improvements in mitochondrial function, which correlates with a reduction in hepatic lipid accumulation (Ramanathan et al., 2023; Karim & Bansal, 2023). Furthermore, selective activation of THRβ avoids stimulating THRα, minimizing the cardiovascular and skeletal adverse effects that are typically associated with non-selective thyroid hormones. Additionally, Resmetirom’s liver-targeted uptake via transporters such as OATP1B1 ensures its predominant localization in hepatocytes, which is critical for achieving the desired therapeutic metabolic effects (Levien & Baker, 2025; Lin et al., 2023). This receptor-specific interaction subsequently supports the hypothesis that the compound will upregulate mitochondrial β-oxidation genes, enhance fatty acid catabolism, and lead to a clinical improvement in hepatic steatosis seen in NASH patients.

Expected Effect:
Based on its molecular mechanism, the expected pharmacodynamic effects of Resmetirom in NASH include a significant reduction in hepatic fat content as well as improvements in liver inflammation and fibrosis markers. In cellular assays and preclinical models, activation of THRβ by Resmetirom results in a dose-dependent increase in the expression of mitochondrial β-oxidation genes like CPT1A and DIO1, leading to enhanced fatty acid oxidation and a subsequent reduction in intrahepatic lipid accumulation (Sinha et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2023). In the proposed assays, human hepatocytes which naturally express high levels of THRβ should show increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption, elevated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and lower levels of intracellular triglycerides upon treatment with Resmetirom. Additionally, the upregulation of these genes has been confirmed in clinical trials where patients demonstrated marked reductions in liver fat measured by MRI-PDFF, reductions in liver transaminases (ALT and AST), and improvements in fibrosis biomarker levels (Harrison et al., 2020; Karim & Bansal, 2023). Given that NASH is characterized by not only steatosis but also progressive fibrosis and inflammation, the expected overall impact should include histological improvements—observable as decreased steatosis and improved fibrosis scores on follow-up liver biopsies—as well as enhanced mitochondrial function in hepatocytes. The anticipated results include a normalization of metabolic profiles, improved lipid parameters (reduction in LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and other atherogenic lipoproteins), and decreased serum markers of liver injury. These outcomes collectively support the therapeutic hypothesis that Resmetirom can modulate hepatocyte metabolism effectively and mitigate the progression of NASH.

Overall Evaluation:
Resmetirom presents as a highly promising candidate for the treatment of NASH based on its clear mechanistic rationale, favorable clinical trial outcomes, and well-delineated therapeutic profile. Among its strengths is the high selectivity for THRβ which confers liver specificity, thereby reducing the potential for off-target, systemic adverse effects often seen with thyroid hormone-based therapies. The compound’s ability to robustly upregulate mitochondrial β-oxidation genes such as CPT1A and DIO1 has been demonstrated in preclinical studies and is supported by clinical Phase II data that shows significant reductions in liver fat, improvements in liver enzyme profiles, and beneficial effects on biomarkers of fibrosis (Karim & Bansal, 2023; Harrison et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2022). Moreover, the extensive clinical trial program, including several pivotal trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; 2019a; 2019b; 2021), provides robust proof-of-concept data that bolster the therapeutic potential of Resmetirom in NASH management. The compound has demonstrated not only significant metabolic improvements but also a manageable safety profile with gastrointestinal side effects being the most common and generally mild (Hasan et al., 2025; Karim & Bansal, 2023).

Nonetheless, there are also some challenges and weaknesses that need attention. While early-phase trials have shown promise, long-term safety data remain limited, particularly regarding potential effects in advanced liver disease or cirrhosis. Although Resmetirom has been evaluated in patients with noncirrhotic NASH and even in well-compensated cirrhosis under controlled conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022), comprehensive long-term outcomes related to liver-related morbidity and mortality are still under investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022). Another concern is that while the upregulation of key mitochondrial genes is an integral part of its mechanism, direct gene and protein expression data from human liver biopsy specimens are limited and further mechanistic studies may be needed to fully elucidate the intracellular pathways involved (Sinha et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2022). In addition, the therapeutic effect on fibrosis appears modest and may require combination therapy approaches to achieve more robust antifibrotic outcomes. Overall, despite these caveats, Resmetirom’s strong receptor specificity, clinical efficacy in reducing hepatic steatosis, and its favorable safety profile position it as one of the most promising repurposed therapeutic candidates for NASH. Its clear mechanistic rationale—centered on the upregulation of mitochondrial β-oxidation and enhanced hepatic lipid catabolism through selective THRβ activation—matches well with the pathophysiological demands of NASH treatment, and further large-scale Phase III data are eagerly awaited to confirm its long-term benefits (Levien & Baker, 2025; Karim & Bansal, 2023).

In summary, based on the comprehensive review of available biochemical, preclinical, and clinical literature, Resmetirom has significant potential for treating NASH. Its molecular mechanism, which activates THRβ in hepatocytes and promotes mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation by upregulating genes such as CPT1A and DIO1, is both biologically plausible and supported by early clinical proof-of-concept data. The compound has already demonstrated notable reductions in hepatic fat content and improvements in liver enzymes, which are pivotal outcomes in NASH management. While long-term data and detailed molecular profiling in human liver tissue are still needed to fully ascertain its antifibrotic efficacy and long-term safety, the strengths of Resmetirom—such as its receptor specificity and favorable metabolic outcomes—make it a compelling candidate to direct further clinical development efforts. The promising early-phase clinical trial results, combined with robust mechanistic insights from preclinical studies, suggest that Resmetirom could play an important role in addressing the high unmet need for effective NASH therapies (Alkhouri, 2020; Karim & Bansal, 2023; Harrison et al., 2020).

"Aldafermin (NGM282, NGM Biopharmaceuticals)","Proposal for Aldafermin (NGM282, NGM Biopharmaceuticals)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Aldafermin (NGM282) is a synthetic analogue of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) that was engineered to recapitulate the beneficial metabolic actions of the native hormone while minimizing its inherent mitogenic and tumorigenic risks. Derived via recombinant DNA technology, Aldafermin incorporates targeted amino acid substitutions and deletions—specifically modifications within the N-terminal region—to separate its metabolic signaling from the pathways that lead to hepatocellular proliferation (Aaldijk et al., 2023, pp. 13–14). This engineered design permits Aldafermin to signal primarily through the fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) in conjunction with the co-receptor β-Klotho (KLB), thereby maintaining efficacy in modulating bile acid synthesis and other metabolic processes while reducing the risk of cell proliferation (Henriksson & Andersen, 2020, pp. 8–9). Aldafermin belongs to the therapeutic class of FGF19 analogues, a group of drugs that have been explored for their capacity to regulate lipid metabolism, bile acid homeostasis, and energy balance. Historically, this class has been investigated for a range of metabolic liver diseases, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and primary cholestatic disorders, due to its ability to target central pathways implicated in hepatic injury and fibrosis (Cate, 2022, pp. 13–16).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of Aldafermin is strongly rooted in its development for conditions characterized by metabolic liver dysfunction. Preclinical studies established that Aldafermin reduces hepatic steatosis, improves insulin sensitivity, and alleviates fibrosis in rodent models by suppressing deleterious bile acid toxicity and modulating hepatic metabolic gene expression (Fallowfield et al., 2021, pp. 9–10; Ocker, 2020, pp. 5–6). Clinically, Aldafermin has progressed through multiple phases of clinical trials, including a robust Phase 2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015) that enrolled patients with biopsy‐confirmed NASH to assess the effects on liver fat content, fibrosis markers, and other biochemical parameters. In these trials, Aldafermin was demonstrated to reduce absolute liver fat content as measured by MRI and to improve histologic features typical of NASH, such as inflammation and fibrotic changes (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Cate, 2022, pp. 5–8). Moreover, its use has not been documented in veterinary medicine, and its development strategy has focused exclusively on targeting metabolic and cholestatic liver diseases in humans (Bhopale & Srinivasan, 2023, pp. 12–13; Cate, 2022, pp. 13–16). The cumulative clinical data indicate that in addition to its lipid-lowering and antifibrotic effects, Aldafermin has engaged its target pathway effectively as evidenced by reduced serum levels of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), a surrogate marker for CYP7A1 activity, further strengthening its candidacy for NASH treatment (Sanyal et al., 2021, pp. 2–3).

Mechanism of Action:
Aldafermin’s established mechanism of action is centered on its ability to mimic the endocrine activities of FGF19 while circumventing the undesirable mitogenic effects associated with native FGF19. Once administered, Aldafermin binds to the FGFR4–β-Klotho receptor complex on hepatocytes, a critical interaction that triggers downstream signaling pathways involved in hepatic metabolism. One of the principle biochemical actions of this receptor engagement is the suppression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis. By inhibiting CYP7A1, Aldafermin effectively lowers bile acid production, reducing the accumulation of hydrophobic and potentially hepatotoxic bile acids that can exacerbate liver inflammation and fibrosis (Henriksson & Andersen, 2020, pp. 2–3; Ocker, 2020, pp. 5–6). In addition, this suppression of bile acid synthesis is associated with decreased serum levels of bile acid intermediates such as C4, providing a direct biochemical readout of Aldafermin’s target engagement.

Beyond bile acid modulation, Aldafermin also influences key metabolic pathways involved in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial β-oxidation. Preclinical evidence indicates that FGF19 analogues, including Aldafermin, induce the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) target genes that regulate fatty acid oxidation (FAO), thereby promoting the catabolism of fatty acids within hepatocytes (Schumacher & Guo, 2019, pp. 27–31). This shift toward enhanced mitochondrial β-oxidation contributes to the reduction of intrahepatic lipid accumulation (steatosis) and alleviation of the lipotoxic environment that precipitates inflammatory cascades and fibrogenesis in NASH (Sanyal et al., 2021, pp. 2–3). Moreover, Aldafermin’s engagement of FGFR4 also indirectly modulates insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis, accompanied by improvements in serum lipid profiles and body weight in certain preclinical models (Fallowfield et al., 2021, pp. 9–10; Henriksson & Andersen, 2020, pp. 8–9). The molecular interactions of Aldafermin, including its capacity to downregulate gene expression of CYP7A1 and to upregulate genes involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation, position it as a multifaceted modulator of hepatic metabolism (Sanyal et al., 2021, pp. 4–5; Schumacher & Guo, 2019, pp. 26–27).

Expected Effect:
Based on its well-characterized mechanism, the expected effect of Aldafermin in the treatment of NASH is multifactorial. Primarily, by binding to the FGFR4/β-Klotho receptor complex on hepatocytes, Aldafermin is anticipated to exert a potent inhibitory effect on CYP7A1, leading to decreased bile acid synthesis. This reduction in bile acid production is critical because excessive, hydrophobic bile acids contribute to hepatocyte injury, inflammation, and ultimately fibrosis through their detergent properties and pro-inflammatory signaling (Sanyal et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Henriksson & Andersen, 2020, pp. 8–9). Simultaneously, Aldafermin’s stimulation of PPARα and related pathways is expected to upregulate mitochondrial β-oxidation genes, thereby enhancing the catabolism of free fatty acids and reducing hepatic lipid accumulation. This dual activity—suppressing lipogenesis while promoting fatty acid oxidation—is central to its hypothesized benefit in reducing hepatic steatosis and mitigating the metabolic stress that underlies NASH (Phan, 2024, pp. 14–16; Cate, 2022, pp. 5–8).

At the cellular level, hepatocytes express both FGFR4 and β-Klotho, ensuring that target engagement occurs in the relevant cell types affected by NASH pathology (Henriksson & Andersen, 2020, pp. 2–3). As Aldafermin engages these receptors, it is expected to initiate signaling cascades that result in decreased expression of genes involved in lipogenesis and concomitant increases in genes necessary for mitochondrial FAO. The net outcome should be a reduction in intracellular lipid droplet accumulation, improved mitochondrial function, and decreased secretion of inflammatory cytokines that contribute to the progressive fibrosis seen in NASH. Clinically, this molecular action has translated into measurable improvements; for instance, phase II trials have reported significant reductions in liver fat content as quantified by imaging modalities like MRI-PDFF, and improvements in fibrosis markers (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Cate, 2022, pp. 5–8). Additionally, the biomarker profile observed in clinical studies—specifically, increased serum levels of FGF19 coupled with reductions in C4 levels—corroborates the mechanism by which Aldafermin modulates bile acid synthesis and metabolic function (Sanyal et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Schumacher & Guo, 2019, pp. 27–31).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of Aldafermin as a therapeutic candidate for NASH is largely favorable, with several notable strengths. First, its rational design as a non-mitogenic FGF19 analogue offers a significant safety advantage over native FGF19 by mitigating oncogenic risks while preserving metabolic efficacy (Aaldijk et al., 2023, pp. 13–14; Henriksson & Andersen, 2020, pp. 8–9). Second, the robust preclinical and clinical data supporting its mechanism of action—namely, the suppression of CYP7A1, reduction in toxic bile acid levels, and enhancement of mitochondrial β-oxidation—provide strong evidence of its potential to address key pathophysiologic drivers of NASH (Sanyal et al., 2021, pp. 2–3; Schumacher & Guo, 2019, pp. 27–31). Third, the observed clinical improvements in liver fat content, serum transaminases, and histological fibrosis scores during Phase II trials further validate its therapeutic promise (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Cate, 2022, pp. 5–8).

Nonetheless, there are certain weaknesses and challenges that warrant consideration. Despite promising short-term efficacy signals, long-term safety and sustained efficacy data in broader NASH populations are still forthcoming, necessitating careful extended follow-up in Phase III trials. The modulation of bile acid synthesis by Aldafermin is associated with a rise in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a recognized side effect that requires concomitant management with lipid-lowering agents such as rosuvastatin to mitigate potential cardiovascular risks (Ocker, 2020, pp. 5–6; Cate, 2022, pp. 5–8). Moreover, while the target engagement as indicated by reductions in serum C4 levels is promising, the clinical heterogeneity of NASH—with its complex interplay of metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrotic pathways—means that patient response might be variable, and a subset of patients may not achieve the desired clinical outcomes despite biochemical improvements. This variability underscores the need for the identification of robust predictive biomarkers (e.g., specific microbiome profiles or genetic variants) to optimize patient selection (Fallowfield et al., 2021, pp. 9–10; Cate, 2022, pp. 13–16). Furthermore, there remains some uncertainty regarding the complete spectrum of downstream molecular effects following FGFR4 activation, and whether alternate signaling pathways may contribute to off-target effects in certain patient subsets (Henriksson & Andersen, 2020, pp. 9–10; Schumacher & Guo, 2019, pp. 26–27).

Taken together, Aldafermin exhibits several compelling attributes as a candidate for repurposing in NASH. Its targeted mechanism of action presents a rational strategy for simultaneously addressing hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis by coupling the inhibition of bile acid synthesis with enhanced mitochondrial β-oxidation. The clinical data, including reductions in hepatic fat and improvements in fibrosis biomarkers, support its potential utility in this challenging disease. However, the weaknesses—primarily relating to lipid profile changes, patient response variability, and the need for long-term safety data—should be carefully weighed as part of an overall risk-benefit assessment. Continued rigorous clinical investigation, including larger and longer-duration studies, will be essential to fully validate Aldafermin’s efficacy and safety profile in NASH before its widespread adoption in clinical practice (Aaldijk et al., 2023, pp. 14–15; Henriksson & Andersen, 2020, pp. 9–10; Cate, 2022, pp. 5–8).

In conclusion, based on the comprehensive review of the biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature available, Aldafermin emerges as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for NASH. Its well-defined molecular rationale, robust target engagement data, and encouraging clinical outcomes support further development and clinical evaluation. While certain challenges remain—most notably, the management of its lipid-related side effects and the need for long-term outcome data—the overall profile of Aldafermin justifies continued investment and research into its application as a metabolic modulator and antifibrotic agent in the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (Aaldijk et al., 2023, pp. 14–15; Henriksson & Andersen, 2020, pp. 9–10; Cate, 2022, pp. 5–8).

Saroglitazar (Zydus Cadila),"Proposal for Saroglitazar (Zydus Cadila)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Saroglitazar is a novel, synthetic small‐molecule drug belonging to the class of dual PPARα/γ agonists. Initially synthesized and developed by Zydus Cadila within India, it was designed to combine the lipid‐lowering effects of PPARα agonism with the insulin‐sensitizing benefits of PPARγ activation. Its chemical structure is distinct from other glitazars, lacking the classic glitazone moiety, and instead incorporating a unique pyrrole component and aryl alkoxy propionic acid scaffold that gives it a favorable receptor binding profile (Kaul et al., 2019). This compound belongs to the glitazar class—a group of dual agonists that have been investigated in the past for dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. Historically, agents of this class have aimed to simultaneously ameliorate hypertriglyceridemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus by targeting both PPARα and PPARγ, although many earlier candidates were halted due to safety concerns. Saroglitazar stands apart by demonstrating potent PPARα activity with an EC50 around 3 nM and moderate PPARγ activity with an EC50 around 38 nM, a balance that underlies its improved safety and efficacy profile compared to earlier dual agonists (Choudhary et al., 2019; Honda et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Saroglitazar was primarily developed and approved in India for diabetic dyslipidemia. Its clinical history includes extensive real‐world evidence and several Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials aimed at metabolic conditions and liver diseases such as non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form, non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Preclinical studies in rodent models of NASH have consistently demonstrated that saroglitazar decreases hepatic steatosis, reduces inflammatory markers, and attenuates fibrotic progression—outcomes that have been confirmed by both biochemical markers (e.g. reduced ALT and AST levels) and histological improvements (Akbari et al., 2021). In clinical settings, trials such as NCT03061721, NCT03863574, and NCT04193982 have provided promising outcomes in patients with NAFLD/NASH, showing improvements in liver enzymes, lipid profiles, and non‐invasive imaging endpoints like MRI‐proton density fat fraction (MRI‐PDFF) (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017, 2019, 2021). In addition, observational real‐world studies in patients with diabetic dyslipidemia and NAFLD have reported significant reductions in triglycerides and enhancements in glycemic control, alongside improvements in surrogate markers of liver fibrosis and steatosis (Goyal et al., 2020; Kaul et al., 2019). While the drug is not yet globally approved for NASH, its established use in diabetic dyslipidemia and accumulating clinical evidence supporting benefits in hepatic parameters provide a robust basis for further repurposing towards NASH treatment.

Mechanism of Action:
Saroglitazar exerts its therapeutic effects through dual activation of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptors (PPARs), specifically PPARα and PPARγ. At the molecular level, PPARα is largely expressed in hepatocytes, where its activation upregulates genes involved in β‐oxidation—such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and acyl‐CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1)—thereby promoting the oxidation of fatty acids, reducing triglyceride synthesis, and mitigating lipid accumulation in the liver (Honda et al., 2021; Choudhary et al., 2019). This increased β‐oxidation is critical in reducing the hepatic lipid burden that contributes to steatosis in NASH. Meanwhile, PPARγ is highly expressed in adipose tissue and, to a lesser extent, in the liver; its activation increases insulin sensitivity and stimulates adiponectin production. Adiponectin enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, decreases inflammatory signaling, and indirectly contributes to decreased hepatic fibrosis by modulating stellate cell activation (Jain et al., 2018; Lange et al., 2022). Structural studies have revealed that saroglitazar’s binding induces a conformational change in the ligand binding domain of both receptors, stabilizing the activation function‐2 (AF‐2) helix required for the recruitment of coactivator proteins, thereby enhancing transcription of target genes (Honda et al., 2021). Preclinical investigations further indicate that saroglitazar’s dual action not only decreases the hepatic lipid load but also exerts anti‐inflammatory and antifibrotic effects, likely by downregulating proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF‐α, IL‐6, and transforming growth factor‐beta (TGF‐β), and modulating adipocytokine profiles (Akbari et al., 2021; Jain et al., 2018). The dual‐receptor mechanism is particularly relevant in the context of NASH, where both steatosis and inflammation contribute synergistically to disease progression.

Expected Effect:
In the context of a comprehensive assay for NASH, saroglitazar is expected to yield multiple beneficial effects. Primarily, due to PPARα activation, there should be an increase in hepatic fatty acid β‐oxidation, evidenced by upregulation of genes such as CPT1A and ACOX1, leading to a reduction in the intrahepatic triglyceride pool. This is anticipated to decrease liver fat content as measured by imaging modalities such as MRI‐PDFF, as observed in previous clinical trials (Gawrieh et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). Secondly, PPARγ engagement is expected to improve systemic insulin sensitivity, reduce hyperglycemia, and increase circulating adiponectin levels; these changes should help modulate inflammatory signaling pathways that contribute to hepatocyte injury and fibrosis (Jain et al., 2018; Lange et al., 2022). Together, these mechanisms will not only reduce the hepatocyte lipid burden but also attenuate downstream inflammation and fibrogenesis. In cellular assays using hepatocyte cultures and co‐cultures with stellate cells, one would expect to detect decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF‐α, IL‐6) and fibrotic markers (e.g., collagen I, α‐SMA) upon treatment with saroglitazar, in line with reported preclinical data (Akbari et al., 2021; Jain et al., 2018). Moreover, improvements in liver enzymes (ALT, AST) would be anticipated in clinical biochemical panels, correlating with a reduction in hepatocellular damage (Roy et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2020). The coordinated action of improving lipid metabolism and enhancing insulin sensitivity provides a logical mechanistic rationale for the expected clinical benefits in NASH patients.

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, saroglitazar presents a compelling therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NASH based on its dual PPARα/γ agonism. Its strength lies in its ability to address multiple pathogenic mechanisms in NASH simultaneously: by activating PPARα, it enhances fatty acid oxidation and reduces hepatic lipid accumulation; by engaging PPARγ, it improves insulin sensitivity and reduces inflammation through increased adiponectin production. The combination of these effects has been validated in both preclinical animal models and early clinical studies, which have demonstrated decreased steatosis, inflammation, and markers of fibrosis, along with improvements in liver enzymes and metabolic parameters (Akbari et al., 2021; Gawrieh et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021).

Strengths of saroglitazar include its robust molecular mechanism, well‐documented preclinical efficacy, and promising clinical data, particularly in improving biochemical markers such as ALT and AST and addressing metabolic dyslipidemia. Its dual specificity with a strong PPARα component and moderated PPARγ activity seems to achieve a balance that minimizes some of the adverse events observed with pure PPARγ agonists like weight gain and edema (Choudhary et al., 2019; Honda et al., 2021). Additionally, the fact that it is already approved for diabetic dyslipidemia in India and has a good safety record in that indication lends further support to its potential repurposing for NASH (Goyal et al., 2020; Rajesh et al., 2022).

However, several weaknesses or challenges must be considered. The global regulatory acceptance for NASH treatment remains pending, and more extensive Phase 3 and long‐term safety studies are necessary to ascertain its efficacy, particularly histological improvements in liver fibrosis and clinical outcomes such as progression to cirrhosis. Furthermore, while the dual action mechanism is promising, the moderate activation of PPARγ might result in suboptimal insulin‐sensitizing effects compared to stronger agonists used in controlled settings, making it critical to identify the correct dosing regimen that optimizes both lipid and glucose metabolic outcomes without tipping the balance toward adverse side effects (Lange et al., 2022; Sharma et al., 2020). Lastly, the majority of clinical evidence arises from Indian real‐world studies and relatively small randomized trials, so multicenter, multinational studies with larger patient populations and longer follow‐up periods are essential to solidify its therapeutic potential in diverse populations (Roy et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021).

In conclusion, based on comprehensive review of biochemical, clinical, and mechanistic literature, saroglitazar offers a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for NASH. Its dual PPARα/γ activity is mechanistically well‐aligned with the pathophysiology of NASH—enhancing fatty acid oxidation and improving insulin sensitivity while reducing inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways. The preclinical evidence, coupled with emerging positive clinical data, supports the hypothesis that saroglitazar will reduce hepatocyte lipid burden and improve both biochemical and histological parameters in NASH patients. Nonetheless, further large‐scale, controlled trials with comprehensive safety and efficacy endpoints are warranted before its definitive role in NASH therapy can be established. The strengths in its molecular design and early clinical performance are balanced by the need for additional data to mitigate potential risk and optimize therapeutic dosing in the complex metabolic environment of NASH (Akbari et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020).

"Pegbelfermin (BMS-986036, BMS)","Proposal for Pegbelfermin (BMS-986036, BMS)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pegbelfermin is a PEGylated analog of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) developed by Bristol‐Myers Squibb to address metabolic dysfunctions associated with non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (Verzijl et al., 2020). It belongs to the class of endocrine regulators that mimic the natural hormone FGF21, originally discovered for its role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism (Geng et al., 2020). The PEGylation modification enhances the molecule’s stability and extends its half‐life, overcoming the limitations of native FGF21 which typically exhibits a short circulating half‐life of only a few hours (Unknown Reference). The synthesis of pegylated FGF21 involves biotechnological production in recombinant systems with the integration of a polyethylene glycol moiety that reduces proteolytic degradation and immunogenicity, thereby facilitating subcutaneous dosing regimens that improve patient compliance (Verzijl et al., 2020). As a therapeutic compound, pegylated FGF21 analogs have been widely investigated for metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity, and now their application is being repurposed toward treating NASH due to overlapping mechanisms of metabolic dysregulation (Cate, 2022). This candidate draws upon extensive prior research on FGF21 biology and has emerged as a promising molecular approach aimed at modulating the multiple metabolic and fibrotic pathways implicated in liver disease (Falamarzi et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Pegbelfermin has undergone rigorous preclinical evaluation as well as several phase 2 clinical trials in patients with NASH and related metabolic disorders, demonstrating consistent reductions in hepatic fat and favorable effects on fibrosis biomarkers (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Early clinical studies, such as the randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial designated NCT02413372, provided evidence that pegylated FGF21 therapy could significantly lower liver fat content within a 16-week treatment period (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Additional trials, including NCT03486899 and NCT03486912, have further expanded its clinical profile by investigating its effects on patients with advanced fibrosis and compensated cirrhosis, thereby validating its potential utility across different stages of NASH progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018a; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018b). The extensive therapeutic history of this compound is supported by data demonstrating improvements in key metabolic parameters including serum lipid levels, adiponectin secretion, and hepatic fat fraction as measured by MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) (Loomba et al., 2023). Preclinical rodent studies have substantiated these clinical findings by documenting an increase in mitochondrial oxygen consumption and biogenesis, further indicating pegylated FGF21’s ability to regulate energy metabolism within hepatocytes (Geng et al., 2020). Furthermore, the safety profile of Pegbelfermin has been established across multiple studies, with adverse events generally being mild and manageable, thus reinforcing its repurposing potential for NASH (Cate, 2022). Overall, the therapeutic history of pegylated FGF21 analogs positions pegelfermin as a candidate with promising early‐phase clinical outcomes that warrant further investigation in larger and prolonged trials (Noureddin et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
Pegbelfermin acts by binding to fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) in a complex with the co‐receptor β-Klotho, which is highly expressed in metabolic tissues including liver and adipose tissue (Raptis et al., 2023). Once engaged, the FGFR1/β-Klotho receptor complex activates intracellular signaling cascades that include the RAS/MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and STAT pathways, ultimately resulting in metabolic reprogramming (Cate, 2022). This receptor-mediated activation upregulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), a critical transcriptional regulator that governs genes responsible for fatty acid oxidation (Falamarzi et al., 2022). In turn, increased PPARα activity leads to enhanced expression of several key enzymes such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), which facilitate mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation respectively (Raptis et al., 2023). The upregulation of these enzymes is expected to drive the oxidation of fatty acids, thereby decreasing hepatic lipid accumulation and improving mitochondrial function in hepatocytes (Raptis et al., 2023). Additionally, this mechanism contributes indirectly to the reduction of lipotoxicity and may attenuate inflammatory and fibrotic signals, thus addressing two central pathogenic components of NASH (Generaux et al., 2022). The overall biochemical cascade engendered by pegylated FGF21 analogs thereby represents a multi‐targeted endocrine approach to correcting the metabolic dysregulation observed in NASH (Geng et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assays, pegelfermin is expected to enhance hepatic fatty acid oxidation by activating the FGFR1/β-Klotho receptor complex, which in turn upregulates PPARα expression and downstream β-oxidation enzymes such as CPT1A and ACOX1 (Raptis et al., 2023). The increased expression and activity of these enzymes will lead to an elevated rate of mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, thereby reducing the intracellular accumulation of triglycerides that contribute to steatosis (Cate, 2022). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that pegelfermin treatment is associated with increased oxygen consumption and improved mitochondrial biogenesis in hepatocytes, validating the hypothesis that enhanced metabolic function underlies the therapeutic effect (Loomba & Frias, 2023). In patients with NASH, clinical trial data have consistently shown robust reductions in hepatic fat content and improvements in fibrosis biomarkers following pegelfermin administration, which support the expected mechanistic outcomes in vivo (Loomba et al., 2023). Moreover, the expected improvement in mitochondrial function can help restore energy homeostasis within hepatocytes and reduce the lipotoxic environment that drives inflammation and fibrogenesis (Noureddin et al., 2020). It is anticipated that these beneficial changes will be reflected in both imaging assessments—such as significant improvements on MRI-PDFF—and in serum biomarkers, including reductions in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (Loomba et al., 2023). As the target protein FGFR1 is expressed in both liver and adipose tissues where β-Klotho is co-localized, the compound’s endocrine effects also contribute to systemic improvements in insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles, ultimately mitigating the progression of NASH (Raptis et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Pegbelfermin stands out as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for NASH given its robust mechanism of action and encouraging clinical data from phase 2 trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Its design as a PEGylated FGF21 analog ensures improved pharmacokinetics and dosing feasibility compared to native FGF21, which is an important advantage for chronic treatment regimens (Verzijl et al., 2020). The compound’s ability to engage the FGFR1/β-Klotho receptor complex and subsequently activate downstream pathways that enhance fatty acid oxidation is well substantiated by both preclinical and clinical studies, thereby providing a strong biochemical rationale for its use in NASH (Raptis et al., 2023). Clinically, pegelfermin has demonstrated promising efficacy by significantly reducing hepatic fat content and ameliorating fibrosis markers over a treatment period that is acceptable in the context of NASH management (Loomba et al., 2023). The observed improvements in metabolic parameters such as triglyceride levels, LDL cholesterol, and adiponectin further reinforce the potential of pegelfermin to address the systemic metabolic disturbances characteristic of NASH (Generaux et al., 2022). One notable strength of this therapeutic candidate is its multi‐targeted approach: by not only reducing hepatic steatosis but also potentially impacting inflammatory and fibrotic processes, pegelfermin may offer comprehensive benefits that extend beyond simple fat reduction (Falamarzi et al., 2022). Additionally, its favorable tolerability profile—characterized predominantly by mild gastrointestinal side effects—adds to its clinical attractiveness when compared to other emerging agents that sometimes present with more severe adverse reactions (Loomba & Frias, 2023).

However, several challenges remain that must be addressed through further clinical investigation. Although short‐term data are promising, longer‐duration studies are necessary to confirm whether pegelfermin can translate biochemical improvements into meaningful histological and clinical endpoints such as reversal of fibrosis or reduced progression to cirrhosis (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018a; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018b). Moreover, optimal dosing regimens need to be established to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing the likelihood of developing tolerance or rebound phenomena, as suggested by dose‐response analyses that hint at a ceiling‐effect beyond a particular dose level (Lu et al., 2024). The complexity of NASH as a disease entity—with contributions from genetic predisposition, metabolic syndrome, and lifestyle factors—may also necessitate combination therapies to achieve the best outcomes, and future studies should evaluate pegelfermin in such multi‐drug protocols (Cate, 2022). Additionally, while the activation of PPARα and the subsequent upregulation of key enzymes such as CPT1A and ACOX1 is mechanistically compelling, further research is needed to elucidate the long‐term impact of such metabolic shifts on overall hepatic function and systemic metabolism (Raptis et al., 2023).

In summary, pegelfermin represents a compelling therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NASH due to its well‐defined molecular mechanism involving FGFR1/β-Klotho activation, its ability to enhance fatty acid oxidation through PPARα‐mediated pathways, and its demonstrated efficacy in reducing hepatic fat and improving fibrosis biomarkers in early‐phase clinical trials (Loomba et al., 2023). Its engineered stability via PEGylation offers practical advantages for chronic therapy, and its effects on metabolic parameters extend its potential benefits to systemic improvements in insulin sensitivity and lipid homeostasis (Noureddin et al., 2020). Strengths of pegelfermin include its multifaceted mode of action, favorable safety profile, and robust preclinical and clinical data that support further development. Weaknesses include the necessity for longer‐term studies to confirm histological improvements, the need to optimize dosing strategies to avoid tolerance, and the potential requirement for combination treatments to fully address the heterogeneity of NASH pathogenesis (Loomba & Frias, 2023).

Based on the comprehensive literature review, our evaluation supports the continued development of pegelfermin as a therapeutic agent for NASH. Its mechanistic rationale—centered on the activation of the FGFR1/β-Klotho receptor complex leading to enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation—and its demonstrated efficacy in reducing liver fat and improving metabolic parameters form a strong foundation for its use in this indication (Raptis et al., 2023). Nevertheless, further phase 3 studies are warranted to assess long‐term outcomes and potential benefits on liver histology in a broader patient population, which will ultimately determine whether this candidate can be integrated into the clinical management paradigm for NASH (Loomba et al., 2023). Given the current unmet need for effective NASH therapeutics and the promising early clinical data, pegelfermin should be prioritized for further investment and development, with careful attention paid to dose optimization and combination therapy strategies that may enhance its efficacy (Cate, 2022).

In conclusion, the evidence gathered from preclinical models, early‐phase clinical trials, and mechanistic studies compellingly indicates that pegelfermin has the potential to address key pathological features of NASH by improving hepatic fatty acid oxidation, mitigating steatosis, and reducing fibrotic progression. Its favorable pharmacokinetic profile enabled by PEGylation, combined with its robust engagement of metabolic signaling pathways, positions it as a particularly innovative candidate in the burgeoning field of NASH therapeutics (Generaux et al., 2022). Moving forward, our research team should focus on designing and executing longer‐term, larger‐scale clinical trials that incorporate histological endpoints along with metabolic biomarkers, which will provide the definitive evidence needed to validate pegelfermin as a disease‐modifying therapy for NASH (Loomba et al., 2023). Such studies will not only clarify the full therapeutic potential of pegelfermin but also establish its place among other emerging agents targeting the metabolic underpinnings of NASH, thereby guiding our next steps in drug development and repurposing strategies (Noureddin et al., 2020).

VK2809 (Viking Therapeutics),"Proposal for VK2809 (Viking Therapeutics)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
VK2809 is a liver‐targeted prodrug belonging to the class of thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRβ) agonists and was originally developed by Viking Therapeutics to treat metabolic liver diseases such as non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This compound is synthesized with a prodrug design that confers preferential activation in the liver, thereby limiting systemic exposure and avoiding off‐target effects on tissues that express THRα, such as the heart and bone (Asgharpour et al., 2021). The chemical design exploits hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes—primarily CYP3A—to convert VK2809 into its active metabolite, which exhibits high potency for THRβ with an EC50 of approximately 0.24 nM and minimal activity on THRα (Bansal & Karim, 2023). Such an approach is consistent with previous developments in selective THRβ agonists, a therapeutic class that has been explored for lipid lowering in dyslipidemia and metabolic liver disease by enhancing hepatic fatty acid oxidation (Byrne et al., 2024). Historically, thyroid hormone analogues have been synthesized either by chemical modification of natural thyroid hormones—such as triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4)—or by creating novel structures that mimic T3’s beneficial effects on metabolism without causing systemic thyrotoxicity (Chui et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Thyroid hormone receptor agonists, particularly those selective for the beta isoform, have been under investigation for several years for their potential to treat metabolic disorders, including non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its inflammatory and fibrotic progression to NASH (Liao et al., 2022). Early agents such as sobetirome (GC-1) and eprotirome showed promise in reducing lipid levels and hepatic steatosis in preclinical studies but were limited by off‐target effects including adverse impacts on cardiac and skeletal tissues (Bansal & Karim, 2023). More recent compounds, including MGL-3196 (resmetirom), have demonstrated significant improvements in liver fat reduction and lipid profiles in phase II and III trials, setting a benchmark for the safety and efficacy profile that newer agents like VK2809 aim to achieve (Karim & Bansal, 2023). VK2809, in contrast with earlier generations, leverages a prodrug strategy specifically intended to improve liver targeting, and early human clinical trials have shown encouraging data with significant reductions in hepatic fat content and favorable safety signals (Viking Therapeutics, Inc., 2016; Bansal & Karim, 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
VK2809 operates through a well-characterized mechanism by selectively activating THRβ receptors that are predominantly expressed in hepatocytes (Byrne et al., 2024). Upon administration, the prodrug is metabolized in the liver by CYP3A enzymes to release its active form, which then binds to THRβ with high affinity, triggering a cascade of intracellular events that include modulation of gene transcription involved in lipid metabolism (Luong et al., 2020). The activated receptor upregulates genes responsible for fatty acid β-oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and autophagy, thereby promoting enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and reducing hepatic triglyceride accumulation (Pu et al., 2025). Furthermore, this selective receptor activation decreases de novo lipogenesis and improves cholesterol clearance by upregulating LDL receptors, an effect that is critical in the management of dyslipidemia seen with NASH (Sinha et al., 2025). At the molecular level, gene expression changes in hepatocytes, such as increased levels of CPT1A, DIO1, and ANGPTL4, have been documented following THRβ activation, underscoring the mechanism by which VK2809 exerts its metabolic and anti-steatotic effects (Luong et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
Preclinical studies in rodent models have demonstrated that VK2809 markedly reduces hepatic triglycerides and improves lipid profiles, which is consistent with increased expression of β-oxidation genes and improved mitochondrial function (Bansal & Karim, 2023). Clinically, treatment with VK2809 has been associated with significant decreases in liver fat content—as measured by imaging modalities such as MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) in phase II trials—indicating that the compound effectively mitigates hepatic steatosis (Viking Therapeutics, Inc., 2019; Asgharpour et al., 2021). The anticipated effect in cellular assays is an upregulation of genes related to β-oxidation and mitochondrial function in hepatocytes, which in turn leads to diminished lipotoxicity, reduced inflammatory signaling, and potentially decreased fibrosis (Prikhodko et al., 2022). It is expected that in human patients with NASH, VK2809 will not only reduce intrahepatic fat accumulation but also improve surrogate markers of liver injury such as ALT and AST levels, while maintaining a safety profile superior to non-selective thyroid hormone therapies (Bansal & Karim, 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of VK2809 as a therapeutic candidate for NASH is highly promising and strategically sound based on its unique attributes. Strengths of VK2809 include its liver-targeted prodrug design and high selectivity for THRβ, which collectively ensure that its beneficial effects on lipid metabolism are maximized in the liver while systemic exposure—and consequently adverse effects on the heart, bone, or skeletal muscle—are minimized (Luong et al., 2020). This liver specificity is of paramount importance in NASH, where off-target effects from systemic thyroid hormone activation have previously limited the utility of earlier agents (Prikhodko et al., 2022). In addition, the robust preclinical data demonstrating improvements in hepatic triglyceride levels, enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, and beneficial gene expression profiles provide a strong mechanistic rationale for its use (Zhao et al., 2022). Early-phase clinical studies have already shown that VK2809 can significantly reduce liver fat and improve lipid profiles in patients with metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, and these effects compare favorably to those observed with other advanced THRβ agonists like resmetirom (Karim & Bansal, 2023).

Notwithstanding these strengths, there are also some challenges to consider in the continued development of VK2809. One potential weakness is the need for longer-term safety data and confirmation of histologic improvements in liver fibrosis beyond reductions in liver fat content, as current data are based on relatively short-duration trials (Viking Therapeutics, Inc., 2016; Bansal & Karim, 2023). Moreover, while the prodrug design enhances hepatic selectivity, inter-individual variability in cytochrome P450 enzyme activity could potentially affect drug activation and pharmacokinetics in some patients, thereby complicating dose optimization (Zhao et al., 2022). There is also the inherent challenge in using imaging modalities as surrogate markers for NASH improvement, given the complex etiopathogenesis of the disease where inflammation and fibrosis also play critical roles (Petroni et al., 2021). Despite these concerns, the overall safety profile observed thus far has been favorable, with minimal thyroid-related adverse effects reported, which is a critical advancement over earlier non-selective compounds (Rubin et al., 2021).

In summary, the comprehensive literature review indicates that VK2809 exhibits strong potential as a repurposed drug candidate for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Its synthetic prodrug nature, combined with targeted activation in the liver and selective engagement of THRβ, underpins a well-defined mechanism of action leading to enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and reduced hepatic steatosis. The therapeutic history of thyroid hormone receptor agonists in metabolic diseases further supports the strategy of utilizing a liver-directed agent to improve NASH outcomes with reduced systemic side effects (Byrne et al., 2024; Bansal & Karim, 2023). While continued clinical trials are essential to address the longer-term efficacy and potential effects on liver fibrosis and inflammation, the evidence thus far suggests that VK2809 is a highly promising candidate that merits further development in a robust clinical program. The strengths of selective receptor activation, pronounced effects on lipid metabolism, and favorable safety profile make it a leading contender among novel therapeutic approaches for NASH, even as potential challenges such as variability in drug activation and the need for comprehensive histologic endpoints are addressed in subsequent studies (Alkhouri, 2020; Tanase et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021).

"Tropifexor (LJN452, Novartis)","Proposal for Tropifexor (LJN452, Novartis)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tropifexor (LJN452) is a highly potent, non‐steroidal agonist of the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) that was developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals through a rational drug design process aimed at overcoming the limitations of earlier bile acid–derived molecules such as obeticholic acid, which, although efficacious, were associated with undesirable side effects including pruritus and lipid profile alterations (Focaccia, 2024, pp. 49–52). It belongs to a novel class of synthetic FXR agonists that are non‐bile acid in nature, characterized by a unique “hammerhead” chemical scaffold which confers high receptor binding affinity with an EC₅₀ in the subnanomolar range (approximately 0.2 nM), a property that distinguishes it from earlier steroidal ligands (Chen et al., 2024, pp. 1–2). The design of tropifexor originated from iterative medicinal chemistry efforts to modify earlier scaffolds such as GW4064, a well‐known FXR agonist that demonstrated potent in vitro activity but suffered from issues related to poor bioavailability and potential hepatobiliary toxicity, thereby prompting a shift toward non‐steroidal, non–bile acid compounds with improved pharmacokinetic profiles (Ding et al., 2024, pp. 4–5). As part of the FXR agonist drug class, tropifexor capitalizes on the ability to regulate bile acid homeostasis, as well as lipid and glucose metabolism, which are critical pathophysiologic processes in liver metabolic diseases such as non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (Unknown Reference). Moreover, the synthesis and discovery of tropifexor are underpinned by structural insights into the ligand binding domain of FXR, enabling its high selectivity and potency that have been validated by both in vitro and in vivo studies (Hernandez et al., 2019, pp. 1–2).

Therapeutic History:
Tropifexor has an extensive preclinical history in rodent models of NASH, where it has been demonstrated to significantly reduce hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, thereby improving overall hepatic histology and biomarker profiles (Hernandez et al., 2019, pp. 2–4). Multiple studies have confirmed that tropifexor treatment in diet-induced NASH models, such as the AMLN model and the STAM model, leads to marked reductions in liver triglyceride levels, collagen deposition, and expression of pro-fibrogenic genes, which has been further corroborated by transcriptomic analyses showing enhancement of antioxidative gene expression patterns (Hernandez et al., 2019, pp. 7–9; Focaccia, 2024, pp. 106–109). Clinically, tropifexor is being evaluated in several Phase II clinical trials for NASH and related liver fibrotic conditions, with trial identifiers such as NCT03517540, NCT04065841, and NCT04147195 documenting its safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy as measured by reductions in liver enzymes and improvements in magnetic resonance imaging–proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018). The therapeutic class of non‐steroidal FXR agonists, which includes compounds such as cilofexor and EDP-305, has been increasingly validated in clinical settings not only for NASH but also for cholestatic liver diseases, thereby building a historical precedent for the repurposing of tropifexor as a therapeutic candidate in metabolic liver conditions (Unknown Reference; Anfuso et al., 2020, pp. 10–11). In addition, early human studies have demonstrated that tropifexor exhibits a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with once-daily oral dosing, acceptable tolerability, and target engagement as evidenced by biomarker changes such as increased fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) levels, which further supports its clinical development for NASH (Badman et al., 2020, pp. 1–2).

Mechanism of Action:
Tropifexor exerts its therapeutic effects primarily through activation of the nuclear receptor FXR, which is abundantly expressed in hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and intestinal epithelial cells, and plays a pivotal role in regulating bile acid synthesis, lipid and glucose homeostasis, and inflammatory responses (Ding et al., 2024, pp. 2–4). Upon binding to FXR, tropifexor promotes a conformational change in the receptor that facilitates the recruitment of coactivator proteins and the formation of a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), which then binds to specific FXR response elements (FXREs) in the promoter regions of target genes (Hernandez et al., 2019, pp. 2–4). One critical downstream effect of FXR activation is the induction of the small heterodimer partner (SHP), a transcriptional corepressor that plays a key role in the suppression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), a master regulator of de novo lipogenesis in hepatocytes (Chen et al., 2024, pp. 12–15). The suppression of SREBP-1c results in a significant reduction in the synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides within the liver, thereby alleviating hepatic steatosis (Cariello et al., 2021, pp. 7–8). Moreover, by lowering intracellular levels of malonyl-CoA—a substrate as well as an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1)—tropifexor indirectly enhances mitochondrial beta-oxidation, promoting the breakdown and clearance of accumulated lipids (Geng et al., 2025, pp. 12–14). FXR activation by tropifexor also induces the expression of fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (FGF15/19) in the ileum, which, upon release into the circulation, acts on the liver to further suppress bile acid synthesis by downregulating cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), thus maintaining bile acid homeostasis and reducing hepatic stress (Ding et al., 2024, pp. 26–28). Additionally, transcriptomic analyses have revealed that tropifexor modulates gene networks associated with antioxidant responses and anti-inflammatory pathways, contributing to reduced oxidative stress and attenuation of fibrogenic signaling in the liver (Hernandez et al., 2019, pp. 7–9; Focaccia, 2024, pp. 123–125). These molecular interactions collectively support the hypothesis that tropifexor can rebalance hepatocyte lipid metabolism while mitigating inflammatory and fibrotic processes that contribute to NASH pathogenesis (Chen et al., 2024, pp. 8–10).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanistic profile, the expected effect of tropifexor in the context of NASH is a multi-pronged improvement in hepatic pathology; specifically, activation of FXR in hepatocytes is anticipated to result in a substantial suppression of de novo lipogenesis through the SHP-mediated inhibition of SREBP-1c, thereby reducing the synthesis and accumulation of fatty acids and triglycerides (Anfuso et al., 2020, pp. 9–10). This suppression is further complemented by a concomitant decrease in malonyl-CoA levels, which permits enhanced mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids and contributes to the clearance of excess lipids from the liver (Geng et al., 2025, p. 17). In preclinical studies, these molecular events have translated into marked reductions in liver fat content, as measured by both biochemical assays and imaging modalities such as MRI-PDFF, along with improvements in liver enzyme profiles (Badman et al., 2020, pp. 11–14; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020). Additionally, the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by tropifexor are expected to manifest as lower serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), as well as reductions in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, all of which are well-documented indicators of hepatic injury and inflammation in NASH patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; Unknown Reference). Furthermore, the downstream induction of genes involved in antioxidative stress responses and the suppression of profibrotic mediators suggest that tropifexor may also ameliorate liver fibrosis, a key concern in the progression of NASH to cirrhosis (Hernandez et al., 2019, pp. 7–9; Focaccia, 2024, pp. 106–109). Taken together, these effects are expected to not only reverse the morphological and functional derangements associated with NASH but also to improve overall liver metabolic homeostasis, which may ultimately translate into better clinical outcomes for patients (Badman et al., 2020, pp. 14–16).

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating tropifexor as a therapeutic candidate for NASH, several strengths are evident: its subnanomolar potency and high selectivity for FXR make it a highly attractive agent from a pharmacodynamic perspective, as these features ensure robust engagement of the target receptor with minimal off-target effects (Chen et al., 2024, pp. 1–2; Focaccia, 2024, pp. 49–52). The extensive preclinical data demonstrating its efficacy in reducing hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in multiple rodent models lends further support to its potential utility in human NASH, and early-phase clinical trials have provided encouraging signals in terms of biomarker improvements and tolerability profiles (Hernandez et al., 2019, pp. 2–4; Unknown Reference). Moreover, its mechanism of action—encompassing the dual ability to suppress de novo lipogenesis via inhibition of SREBP-1c and to promote mitochondrial beta-oxidation by decreasing malonyl-CoA levels—aligns well with the current pathophysiologic understanding of NASH, where impaired lipid metabolism plays a central role (Geng et al., 2025, pp. 12–14; Ding et al., 2024, pp. 26–28). Additionally, tropifexor’s ability to modulate inflammatory and fibrogenic pathways through FXR activation may offer a significant clinical advantage in halting or even reversing the progression of liver fibrosis, a notoriously difficult-to-treat component of advanced NASH (Focaccia, 2024, pp. 106–109; Anfuso et al., 2020, pp. 10–11).

Nonetheless, there are important weaknesses and potential risks that warrant cautious consideration. One of the main challenges associated with FXR agonists, including tropifexor, is the dose-dependent occurrence of pruritus, which has been observed clinically and can limit patient compliance if not properly managed (Badman et al., 2020, pp. 8–10; Unknown Reference). Moreover, while the preclinical models have shown impressive short-term efficacy, some long-term studies and preclinical observations raised concerns regarding hepatomegaly, increased hepatocyte proliferation, and potential pro-carcinogenic signals when FXR pathways are over-activated, although these signals remain to be definitively substantiated in human trials (Focaccia, 2024, pp. 123–125; Bak & Hsu, 2020, pp. 14–17). There are also potential metabolic side effects to consider; even though tropifexor appears to have an improved lipid profile compared to bile acid–derived agonists, ongoing vigilant monitoring of plasma cholesterol levels and other lipid parameters will be essential in clinical settings (Anfuso et al., 2020, pp. 9–10; Ding et al., 2024, pp. 17–18). Another area of potential limitation is the risk of off-target effects associated with global FXR activation in tissues beyond the liver and intestine, which could lead to unforeseen complications in long-term therapy if not carefully managed through dosage optimization and patient selection (Badman et al., 2020, pp. 11–14).

Overall, tropifexor represents a promising and mechanistically well-supported therapeutic candidate for NASH, offering robust FXR activation that can rebalance hepatocyte lipid metabolism while also mitigating inflammatory and fibrotic processes key to the disease’s progression (Hernandez et al., 2019, pp. 7–9; Ding et al., 2024, pp. 26–28). Its high potency, good pharmacokinetic properties, and favorable early clinical signals underscore its potential as part of the next generation of NASH therapies. However, further large-scale and long-term clinical studies will be necessary to fully evaluate its safety profile, particularly with respect to pruritus, lipid alterations, and any potential pro-tumorigenic risks associated with chronic FXR activation (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; Unknown Reference; Focaccia, 2024, pp. 106–109). In summary, while tropifexor shows significant promise for the treatment of NASH, its future utility will depend on careful dose optimization, patient stratification, and comprehensive post-marketing surveillance to ensure that its potent biological effects translate into a meaningful clinical benefit with an acceptable risk profile (Badman et al., 2020, pp. 14–16; Geng et al., 2025, p. 17).

In conclusion, tropifexor’s robust preclinical efficacy, validated mechanism of action via FXR activation, and supportive early clinical data collectively suggest that it could serve as an effective therapy for NASH if its potential side effects are properly managed. Given the complex pathology of NASH—which encompasses steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis—tropifexor’s multifaceted mechanism, leading to decreased lipogenesis, enhanced fatty acid oxidation, modulation of bile acid synthesis, and anti-inflammatory as well as antifibrotic effects, positions it as a strong candidate for further development (Hernandez et al., 2019, pp. 2–4; Ding et al., 2024, pp. 2–4). The current data emphasize both the promise and challenges of advancing tropifexor into late-stage clinical trials and, ultimately, into clinical practice, where its ability to restore metabolic equilibrium and improve liver histology might offer substantial benefits for patients suffering from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (Anfuso et al., 2020, pp. 10–11; Unknown Reference). Therefore, recruiting further evidence through well-designed Phase III trials as well as mechanistic studies aimed at unraveling long-term effects will be critical to establishing tropifexor as a cornerstone in the therapeutic armamentarium against NASH (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019; Focaccia, 2024, pp. 49–52).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Cilofexor is a fully synthetic, non-steroidal agonist of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) that was discovered and subsequently optimized through rational, structure–activity relationship approaches. Early FXR ligands such as GW4064 provided the chemical and conceptual foundation, and cilofexor was further refined by replacing vulnerable motifs such as the stilbene olefin with alternative groups (for example, a cyclopropyl moiety) to enhance aqueous solubility, membrane permeability, and oral bioavailability (Li et al., 2020). This medicinal chemistry breakthrough places cilofexor into a new generation of non-bile acid synthetic FXR agonists that have been developed to address metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrotic disturbances in chronic liver diseases. FXR, a nuclear receptor expressed predominantly in the liver and intestine, regulates bile acid homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory responses; thus, molecules belonging to the FXR agonist class have historically been exploited to modulate gene expression for therapeutic benefit in a wide array of metabolic disorders (Hoofnagle, 2020). Compared to steroidal FXR agonists such as obeticholic acid, cilofexor’s non-steroidal structure is designed to reduce off-target adverse effects like severe pruritus and dyslipidemia while maintaining potent receptor activation through an EC₅₀ in the nanomolar range (approximately 37 nM) (Kremoser, 2021). In sum, the synthetic origins and careful molecular optimization of cilofexor clearly demonstrate its intended selectivity and improved pharmacokinetic properties relative to previous FXR ligands, which is central to its development as a candidate for NASH.

Therapeutic History
Over recent years, cilofexor has been thoroughly evaluated in a series of preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials to establish its safety, tolerability, and target engagement. In an initial Phase 1 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016), healthy volunteers received escalating doses of cilofexor to evaluate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, and results showed a dose-dependent increase in circulating fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) and modulation of key biomarkers such as 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) that reflect bile acid synthesis. Subsequent Phase 2 studies conducted in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis have further defined cilofexor’s clinical profile, with trials demonstrating improvements in imaging-based measures of hepatic steatosis (for example, reductions in MRI-proton density fat fraction) as well as favorable shifts in serum markers like ALT, AST, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). These studies have included both non-cirrhotic individuals and those with early cirrhosis, establishing that cilofexor can be safely administered in populations with progressive liver disease. Moreover, combination studies—such as those in the ATLAS trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018) and other combination protocols where cilofexor was paired with agents like firsocostat (an acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor) or selonsertib (an ASK1 inhibitor)—have demonstrated that cilofexor not only shows measurable monotherapeutic benefits but may also have additive or synergistic effects when targeting de novo lipogenesis or fibrogenic signaling pathways in NASH (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019). In these combination settings, cilofexor contributed to further biomarker improvements and modest histological benefits when compared with placebo, thereby reinforcing its potential in the therapeutic landscape of NASH (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Overall, the therapeutic history of cilofexor is characterized by consistent biochemical evidence of FXR engagement and promising early clinical signals in reducing hepatic fat and modulating liver enzymes, which are central to disease management in NASH.

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, cilofexor exerts its pharmacological activity by acting as a high-affinity agonist of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a bile acid–sensing nuclear receptor intricately involved in maintaining intracellular and systemic metabolic balance. Once cilofexor binds to the ligand-binding domain of FXR, it promotes heterodimerization of FXR with the retinoid X receptor (RXR); this complex then translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with specific FXR response elements on DNA to modulate the transcription of a diverse range of target genes (Hoofnagle, 2020). One crucial outcome of FXR activation is the induction of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) in the ileum, which is subsequently secreted into the circulation and acts on the liver to suppress the expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis (Hoofnagle, 2020; Ding et al., 2024). This downregulation of CYP7A1 is fundamental to reducing the hepatic bile acid load and thereby preventing cellular injury induced by toxic bile acid accumulation. In addition, FXR activation by cilofexor leads to the upregulation of small heterodimer partner (SHP), a nuclear receptor corepressor that inhibits the activity of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), a master regulator of de novo lipogenesis (Dufour et al., 2020). By suppressing SREBP-1c, the expression of lipogenic enzymes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), is diminished; as ACC is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, its downregulation results in decreased levels of malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA is known to inhibit carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), the enzyme critical for the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation. Therefore, by lowering malonyl-CoA, cilofexor effectively relieves the inhibition of CPT1, thereby enhancing mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation and promoting the oxidation of accumulated lipids within hepatocytes (Dufour et al., 2020; Hoofnagle, 2020).

Beyond these metabolic effects, FXR activation also modulates inflammatory responses; by decreasing bile acid synthesis and improving the bile acid profile, cilofexor indirectly reduces the triggering of inflammatory cascades that are otherwise activated by bile acid overload. Preclinical studies have further demonstrated that FXR agonism results in reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and amelioration of liver fibrosis, which is supported by histopathological evaluations showing decreased liver stiffness and collagen deposition in treated models (Ding et al., 2024; Drenth & Schattenberg, 2020). Collectively, the mechanism of action of cilofexor is multifaceted; it leverages FXR-mediated transcriptional regulation to alter bile acid synthesis, suppress lipogenesis, and enhance fatty acid oxidation, while concomitantly exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. This cascade—from receptor activation to downstream molecular events—provides a strong mechanistic rationale for the use of cilofexor in rebalancing aberrant lipid metabolism and reducing hepatic injury in NASH.

Expected Effect in NASH
The central hypothesis driving the clinical development of cilofexor in NASH is that the targeted activation of FXR will result in beneficial metabolic reprogramming within the liver. By upregulating FGF19, cilofexor is expected to suppress de novo lipogenesis through the downregulation of SREBP-1c and ACC expression. This suppression lowers intracellular malonyl-CoA levels, which in turn relieves the inhibitory effect on CPT1, thereby enhancing mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids (Dufour et al., 2020; Hoofnagle, 2020). The net effect of this molecular cascade is a substantial reduction in hepatic steatosis, addressing one of the defining features of NASH. In clinical settings, early-phase studies with cilofexor have demonstrated measurable reductions in hepatic fat content using imaging technologies such as MRI-PDFF, as well as improvements in liver enzymes (including ALT and AST) that serve as surrogate markers for hepatocellular injury (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Loomba et al., 2021).

Furthermore, cilofexor’s ability to recalibrate bile acid synthesis by downregulating CYP7A1 plays an important modulatory role in reducing bile acid–induced hepatocellular stress and inflammation. When excess bile acids accumulate, they can trigger inflammatory signaling pathways; by normalizing bile acid homeostasis, cilofexor indirectly attenuates inflammation—a key driver of progression from steatosis to fibrosis in NASH (Hoofnagle, 2020; Nathani, 2023). In addition to these effects, observations from clinical trials indicate that cilofexor may decrease fibrosis markers, such as the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) score and liver stiffness as measured by transient elastography, suggesting that the compound could also possess anti-fibrotic properties. Taken together, the expected effects in NASH are two-fold: firstly, a direct metabolic benefit from the reduction of hepatic lipid accumulation through enhanced β-oxidation; and secondly, an indirect anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic benefit resulting from improved bile acid regulation. The overall result should be an amelioration of the biochemical, structural, and functional disturbances that define NASH pathology.

Overall Evaluation
Considering the mechanistic and clinical evidence obtained from preclinical studies and multiple early-phase trials, cilofexor represents a robust and scientifically grounded candidate for the treatment of NASH. One of its principal strengths is its highly selective, non-steroidal FXR agonist profile, which offers significant advantages over earlier steroidal FXR agonists by reducing common side effects such as pruritus and dyslipidemia when used at optimized doses (Kremoser, 2021; Nathani, 2023). The oral bioavailability and favorable pharmacokinetic profile of cilofexor further support its suitability for chronic administration, a necessary attribute for addressing a progressive, long-term disease like NASH (Li et al., 2020).

Mechanistically, the cascade initiated by FXR activation—comprising FGF19 induction, subsequent CYP7A1 suppression, SHP upregulation, SREBP-1c and ACC inhibition, and ultimately enhanced CPT1-mediated mitochondrial β-oxidation—addresses the core metabolic derangements observed in NASH. This multifaceted mechanism is supported by both biochemical data and imaging studies that document reductions in hepatic steatosis and favorable changes in liver enzyme levels (Hoofnagle, 2020; Dufour et al., 2020). In addition, by normalizing bile acid synthesis and improving the bile acid profile, cilofexor may reduce hepatocyte stress and the inflammatory milieu that drives fibrosis progression—a welcome benefit in a condition where both steatosis and inflammation play central roles (Ding et al., 2024; Drenth & Schattenberg, 2020).

However, challenges remain. Pruritus has been noted as a dose-dependent side effect of FXR agonists, including cilofexor, which necessitates careful dose titration and consideration for long-term tolerability (Loomba et al., 2021). Moreover, while biomarker improvements have been consistently observed, the translation of these surrogate endpoints into sustained histological improvements—particularly fibrosis regression—has been modest in some studies, suggesting that further optimization in dosing strategies or patient selection might be needed (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Additionally, off-target metabolic effects, such as increases in LDL cholesterol and decreases in HDL cholesterol, have been reported and require integrated monitoring during therapy (Nathani, 2023). These considerations underscore the potential need for combination therapies where cilofexor is used alongside agents that can counterbalance lipid perturbations or target complementary pathogenic pathways, such as inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis or anti-inflammatory compounds (Loomba et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018).

Patient heterogeneity in NASH further complicates the clinical development narrative. The spectrum of NASH ranges from simple steatosis to advanced fibrosis and compensated cirrhosis, and differences in the expression level of FXR and its downstream targets among patients may influence treatment response. Therefore, future clinical trials must incorporate careful stratification of patient subgroups and, if feasible, integrate novel digital pathology or machine learning-based approaches for more accurate quantification of histological endpoints (Loomba et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021).

In summary, cilofexor’s scientific rationale—grounded in its potent FXR activation, improved pharmacokinetic profile, and demonstrated engagement of key metabolic pathways—combined with promising early clinical signals, positions it as a highly desirable candidate in the evolving treatment landscape for NASH. Continued investment in longer-term studies, optimization of dosing regimens, and potential combination strategies are warranted to fully realize its therapeutic potential. Despite challenges such as pruritus and lipid alterations, the ability of cilofexor to significantly reduce hepatic steatosis, improve liver biochemistry, and possibly attenuate fibrosis supports its further development and inclusion in multidrug regimens designed to address the complex multifactorial pathophysiology of NASH (Hoofnagle, 2020; Loomba et al., 2021; Nathani, 2023).

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of EDP-305 for NASH, structured as requested.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
EDP-305 is a novel, highly potent, and selective synthetic agonist of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). It was developed by Enanta Pharmaceuticals as part of an effort to improve the therapeutic profile of FXR agonists for liver diseases such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Unlike earlier FXR ligands such as obeticholic acid (OCA)—a semi-synthetic derivative of chenodeoxycholic acid—EDP-305 is designed with modifications that enhance its potency (EC50 in the low nanomolar range, approximately 3 nM) and selectivity while potentially avoiding the formation of harmful conjugate metabolites that have been associated with toxicity in other compounds. As a member of the FXR agonist class, EDP-305 belongs to a group of small molecule agents that modulate bile acid homeostasis, lipid and glucose metabolism, and anti-inflammatory as well as anti-fibrotic pathways. FXR agonists have been previously explored for disorders ranging from cholestatic liver diseases like primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) to metabolic liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and NASH (Chau et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
The FXR agonist class has been widely studied and several members—most notably OCA—have shown promise in modulating liver histopathology in metabolic liver diseases. OCA, for instance, has been evaluated in multiple phase II and III trials, including the FLINT and REGENERATE studies, and has demonstrated improvements in fibrosis and liver enzyme profiles albeit with side effects such as pruritus and dyslipidemia (Huisman et al., 2021; Kremoser, 2021). EDP-305 is emerging as a candidate in this therapeutic space for NASH. Preclinical data have shown that EDP-305 can reduce liver triglycerides, attenuate hepatocyte ballooning, and lower inflammation markers in rodent models, using NASH models such as the streptozotocin-high fat diet (STAM) and diet-induced NASH (DIN) models (Chau et al., 2019). Moreover, Phase I studies of EDP-305 have demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile with high liver exposure and manageable rates of pruritus. In clinical development, there have been studies such as NCT03421431 and NCT04378010 that have evaluated EDP-305’s safety, tolerability, and efficacy endpoints in patients with NASH, supporting its repurposing as a therapeutic candidate for this disease (A Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of EDP-305 in Subjects With Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis, 2018; A Randomized, Double-blind Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of EDP-305 in Subjects With Liver-biopsy Proven NASH, 2020). While FXR modulation has classically been used in other liver conditions such as PBC, the current body of evidence strongly supports therapeutic potential for NASH, especially given the high number of trials evaluating FXR agonists in non-cirrhotic and fibrotic NASH populations (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
EDP-305 exerts its effects through highly specific activation of the nuclear receptor FXR, which is abundantly expressed in hepatocytes, intestinal epithelial cells, and cholangiocytes. Once activated by EDP-305, FXR translocates to the nucleus where it binds to FXR response elements in the promoter regions of target genes. One of the key downstream events is the upregulation of the small heterodimer partner (SHP). SHP, in turn, suppresses the transcription of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), a central regulator of lipogenesis. This suppression yields a reduction in de novo lipogenesis, which is hypothesized to lower intracellular malonyl-CoA levels. Since malonyl-CoA is a well-established inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1)—the rate-limiting enzyme in mitochondrial β-oxidation—its reduction is expected to indirectly promote CPT1-mediated fatty acid transport into mitochondria, thereby enhancing mitochondrial β-oxidation and lowering hepatic triglyceride accumulation (Chau et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2022).

In addition to its effects on the lipogenesis pathway, FXR activation by EDP-305 also results in the repression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis. This mechanism is part of a negative feedback loop that maintains bile acid homeostasis and protects the liver from bile acid toxicity. Furthermore, FXR agonism has been demonstrated to reduce inflammatory gene expression in macrophages and fibroblast activation in hepatic stellate cells. In vitro studies have shown that EDP-305 not only reduces the expression of key lipogenic genes such as SREBP-1c, SCD1, and PCSK9 but also dampens inflammatory signaling cascades in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated THP-1 macrophages and decreases fibrotic markers in TGFβ-activated hepatic stellate cells (Chau et al., 2019; Huisman et al., 2021). These multifaceted actions make EDP-305 a promising candidate to target not just the metabolic derangements but also the inflammatory and fibrotic components that characterize NASH.

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, EDP-305 is expected to have several beneficial effects in the context of NASH. In hepatocyte models, activation of FXR by EDP-305 should induce the upregulation of SHP, leading to the downregulation of SREBP-1c and consequent suppression of lipogenic enzyme expression. This cascade is predicted to lower the levels of malonyl-CoA, thereby relieving the inhibition imposed on CPT1 and ultimately enhancing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Such a shift in hepatic lipid handling would be expected to reduce triglyceride accumulation and liver steatosis, a primary driver of NASH pathogenesis (Chau et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2022).

In addition to addressing steatosis, the anti-inflammatory action of FXR agonism should result in reduced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, which are pivotal mediators of liver injury and progression to fibrosis. In vitro investigations using hepatic macrophages have demonstrated that EDP-305 robustly suppresses these inflammatory markers (Chau et al., 2019). The expected anti-fibrotic effect is mediated through the inhibition of hepatic stellate cell activation, as evidenced by decreases in fibrotic markers (e.g., α-SMA, COL1A1) in preclinical models, thus potentially slowing the progression of fibrosis in NASH patients. Furthermore, EDP-305 appears to favorably modulate lipoprotein metabolism by promoting LDL receptor upregulation and enhancing LDL uptake, which may contribute to a more favorable lipid profile in treated subjects (Unknown Reference; Chau et al., 2019).

Overall, in an assay setting—whether in cellular models or in animal studies of NASH—one would expect EDP-305 to produce a dose-dependent decrease in intracellular lipid accumulation, concomitant with a reduction in inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways. In clinical terms, this should translate to improvements in biochemical parameters (e.g., reductions in ALT and AST levels), better hepatic histology (with lower NAFLD activity scores and reduced fibrosis staging), and improved overall metabolic profiles in patients with NASH (A Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of EDP-305 in Subjects With Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis, 2018; A Randomized, Double-blind Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of EDP-305 in Subjects With Liver-biopsy Proven NASH, 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
EDP-305 offers a compelling therapeutic option for NASH with several key strengths. First, its potent and selective FXR agonism (with an EC50 around 3 nM) ensures that even low doses can robustly activate the FXR signaling pathway. This high potency is supported by preclinical in vivo data that demonstrate efficacy in reducing liver triglycerides, inflammation, and fibrosis in rodent models of NASH (Chau et al., 2019). The drug's mechanism of action is well-aligned with the pathophysiological processes underlying NASH, as it targets dysregulated lipid metabolism, chronic inflammation, and fibrogenesis, which collectively drive disease progression. The modulation of lipogenesis via SHP upregulation and subsequent SREBP-1c suppression is particularly important, as it may lead to downstream reductions in malonyl-CoA levels and, hence, promote CPT1-mediated mitochondrial β-oxidation—a mechanism that addresses the core metabolic disturbance in NASH (Xu et al., 2022; Chau et al., 2019).

Another significant strength is the favorable pharmacokinetic profile that has been observed in early-phase studies. High liver exposure coupled with manageable adverse effects, notably lower rates of pruritus compared to other FXR agonists like OCA, position EDP-305 advantageously. Given that pruritus has been a limiting factor in the clinical development of other agents in this class (e.g., OCA), the tolerability of EDP-305 is a key differentiator (A Randomized, Double-blind Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of EDP-305 in Subjects With Liver-biopsy Proven NASH, 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Despite these promising aspects, some weaknesses and challenges remain. The hypothesis regarding the reduction of malonyl-CoA and the subsequent increase in CPT1-mediated β-oxidation, while mechanistically plausible and supported by indirect evidence from gene regulation studies, has not yet been explicitly validated in clinical settings. This represents an area where additional biomarker studies and mechanistic evaluations in humans will be crucial. Furthermore, as with other FXR agonists, concerns regarding dyslipidemia—particularly increases in LDL cholesterol—persist and will require careful monitoring and perhaps combination therapy or dose titration strategies to mitigate long-term cardiovascular risks (Kremoser, 2021; Prikhodko et al., 2022).

In summary, EDP-305 emerges as a promising candidate for the treatment of NASH. Its robust FXR agonistic activity, favorable impact on hepatic lipid metabolism (via SHP upregulation and reduced SREBP-1c expression), and demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models provide a strong rationale for further clinical development. The candidate’s mechanism of action is well substantiated by a body of biochemical and preclinical literature, and its early clinical safety profile appears manageable. However, like other agents in its class, long-term efficacy and safety, particularly regarding lipid alterations and potential off-target effects, must be thoroughly established in larger phase II/III trials. Given the urgent need for effective therapies in NASH, EDP-305 is a strong candidate whose continued development merits prioritization, provided that the anticipated mechanistic benefits translate into meaningful clinical outcomes without untoward adverse events (Chau et al., 2019; Huisman et al., 2021; A Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of EDP-305 in Subjects With Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis, 2018; A Randomized, Double-blind Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of EDP-305 in Subjects With Liver-biopsy Proven NASH, 2020).

Overall, based on the current evidence from biochemical, cellular, preclinical, and early clinical studies, EDP-305 holds significant potential to address fundamental pathogenic mechanisms in NASH by modulating hepatic lipid metabolism, reducing inflammation, and attenuating fibrosis. Future studies that include detailed biomarker analysis (such as measuring malonyl-CoA levels and CPT1 activity directly) and longer-term clinical endpoints will be essential to fully validate its therapeutic impact. The strengths—potency, selectivity, and a mechanistically sound approach—are notable, although careful attention must be directed toward managing the typical class effects associated with FXR activation. Consequently, the overall evaluation supports the further advancement of EDP-305 in the clinical development pipeline for NASH (Chau et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2022).

Pemafibrate (Kowa Pharmaceuticals),"Proposal for Pemafibrate (Kowa Pharmaceuticals)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pemafibrate is a novel, synthetic selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) modulator (SPPARMα) developed by Kowa Pharmaceuticals. It belongs to the fibrate class of compounds, but unlike traditional fibrates that have broad PPAR activity, pemafibrate has been structurally engineered to exhibit exceptionally high potency and receptor selectivity (EC₅₀ ∼1 nM) for PPARα. This high degree of selectivity provides a more targeted mechanism of action with fewer off‐target effects, which is critical given the established roles of PPARα in regulating fatty acid uptake, mitochondrial beta‐oxidation, and inflammation in hepatocytes. Pemafibrate was discovered as part of an effort to optimize the beneficial effects of PPARα activation seen with earlier fibrates while minimizing their dose‐dependent side effects on hepatic and renal function. Historically, fibrates have been used primarily to manage dyslipidemia by lowering triglyceride levels and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in patients; pemafibrate extends this utility with a “designer” approach that leads to robust modulation of gene expression related to fatty acid catabolism in liver tissue (Honda et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
Traditionally, fibrates such as fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, and clofibrate have been employed in a clinical setting to treat hyperlipidemia and related cardiovascular risk factors by stimulating PPARα. However, while these compounds have demonstrated efficacy in lowering plasma triglyceride levels in dyslipidemic patients, their utility in treating liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been inconsistent, partly due to off-target effects and modest receptor selectivity. Pemafibrate represents the next generation of this class, and early clinical trials—such as those registered under ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT03350165 and NCT06623539—have evaluated its potential in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, with endpoints that include liver enzyme reductions and improvements in imaging biomarkers of liver fat and stiffness (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020). Preclinical studies in rodent models of NASH have consistently shown that pemafibrate not only improves dyslipidemia but also exerts beneficial effects on hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and markers of fibrosis; these findings are supported by multiple reports demonstrating improvements in liver function tests (ALT, AST) and favorable alterations in lipid metabolic profiles (Honda et al., 2017; Ikeda et al., 2020). In observational studies, such as those conducted by Morishita et al., pemafibrate administration led to significant improvements in liver dysfunction and non-invasive surrogates of liver fibrosis in NAFLD patients with hypertriglyceridemia, further highlighting its clinical potential (Morishita et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
At its core, pemafibrate acts via selective activation of PPARα—a nuclear receptor highly expressed in hepatocytes—that orchestrates the transcriptional regulation of genes responsible for fatty acid uptake, mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta-oxidation, and inflammation modulation. Under normal physiology, PPARα binds endogenous ligands such as fatty acids to regulate the expression of key metabolic enzymes including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1). CPT1A is essential for mitochondrial transport of long-chain fatty acids, while ACOX1 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in peroxisomal beta-oxidation, thereby contributing to the clearance of excess fatty acids that, if accumulated, can lead to lipotoxicity. Preclinical studies have shown that pemafibrate’s high selectivity translates into robust upregulation of these mitochondrial beta-oxidation genes, leading to enhanced fatty acid catabolism in hepatocytes (Honda et al., 2017; Gellrich & Merk, 2017). In addition to promoting fatty acid oxidation, PPARα activation has been demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-κB signaling pathways and subsequently lowering the expression of proinflammatory cytokines—a mechanism that is especially important in the context of NASH where chronic hepatic inflammation contributes to disease progression (Shinozaki et al., 2020). Notably, pemafibrate’s ability to activate PPARα with high potency is facilitated by its unique Y-shaped molecular structure, which reinforces its receptor binding affinity and leads to a favorable downstream transcriptional response in liver cells. The specific molecular interactions entail enhanced binding of co-activators that facilitate histone acetylation at target gene promoters, thus driving the transcription of genes involved in enhancing mitochondrial beta-oxidation and reducing triglyceride accumulation within hepatocytes (Honda et al., 2017; Sasaki et al., 2020). These interactions not only augment fatty acid catabolism but also help to rebalance lipid homeostasis and decrease hepatic lipotoxicity, which is a key driver of inflammation and fibrosis in NASH.

Expected Effect:
Based on its high receptor selectivity and potent activation of PPARα, the expected effect of pemafibrate in NASH hepatocytes is multifaceted. First, by transcriptionally upregulating mitochondrial beta-oxidation genes such as CPT1A and ACOX1, pemafibrate is anticipated to enhance the catabolic breakdown of fatty acids—leading to decreased intracellular lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. This mechanism directly addresses one of the pivotal features of NASH, where excessive ingestion and synthesis of lipids result in steatosis (Liss & Finck, 2017). Second, enhanced fatty acid oxidation is expected to mitigate lipotoxicity, thereby reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequent hepatocyte injury that often precedes inflammation and fibrosis. Third, by decreasing the cellular lipid burden, pemafibrate may indirectly attenuate proinflammatory signaling cascades, which are normally amplified in the setting of steatosis through the activation of NF-κB and related inflammatory pathways (Seko et al., 2020; Shinozaki et al., 2020). Furthermore, early clinical studies have demonstrated that pemafibrate lowers serum markers of liver injury such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which are surrogate markers for hepatocellular damage; these findings are consistent with improved hepatic metabolic health and reduced inflammatory signaling (Morishita et al., 2023; Shinozaki et al., 2021). Importantly, the upregulation of beta-oxidation genes is a well-established effect of PPARα activation in hepatic cells, and several rodent models have shown that pemafibrate, through this mechanism, can prevent the development of NASH by counteracting the metabolic disturbances that lead to fat accumulation, inflammation, and eventual fibrosis (Sasaki et al., 2020; Honda et al., 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating pemafibrate as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for NASH, several strengths and weaknesses emerge based on current biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature. One of the primary strengths of pemafibrate is its exceptionally high potency and selectivity for PPARα, with an EC₅₀ of approximately 1 nM, which translates into robust transcriptional activation of genes involved in mitochondrial beta-oxidation like CPT1A and ACOX1. This attribute is critical because genetic loss-of-function studies in PPARα have demonstrated exacerbated steatosis, underscoring the receptor’s central role in hepatic lipid metabolism (Honda et al., 2017; Liss & Finck, 2017). The selective nature of pemafibrate potentially minimizes the off-target and adverse effects associated with older fibrates, which have historically been limited by dose-dependent hepatic and renal toxicities. Another strength is its favorable pharmacokinetic profile, including oral bioavailability and a well-characterized ADME profile, which further supports its feasibility for long-term use in a chronic disease setting such as NASH (Honda et al., 2017; Sasaki et al., 2020).

On the therapeutic history front, pemafibrate has successfully undergone early clinical evaluations in dyslipidemic populations, where it improved lipid profiles and reduced serum liver enzymes without significant adverse effects, suggesting secondary benefits on liver function. Its inclusion in recent phase 2 trials specifically targeting NAFLD/NASH—albeit with limited sample sizes and endpoints mainly focused on biochemical improvements—indicates that there is growing clinical interest in repurposing this agent for liver disease. However, while early clinical signals are promising, there remains a critical need for longer-term, large-scale randomized controlled trials to definitively establish its efficacy in improving histological markers of NASH (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; Ikeda et al., 2020).

The mechanism of action of pemafibrate is rational and supported by extensive preclinical evidence; PPARα activation leads to upregulation of mitochondrial beta-oxidation pathways, reduction of intracellular lipids, amelioration of hepatic inflammation, and potentially a slowing down of the fibrogenesis process. In rodent models, pemafibrate has consistently demonstrated the ability to modulate lipid droplet dynamics, increase the number of smaller lipid droplets (a metabolic adaptation that reduces lipotoxicity), and lower inflammatory cytokine levels—effects that are mechanistically anticipated to translate into clinical benefit by halting or reversing the progression of NASH (Sasaki et al., 2020; Seko et al., 2020). In addition, the compound’s ability to reduce serum liver enzymes such as ALT and AST in clinical studies provides indirect evidence that it improves overall hepatic health.

Nonetheless, there are certain weaknesses and challenges that need to be considered. One concern is the potential discrepancy between the robust efficacy observed in rodent models and the more modest results sometimes seen in human studies with other PPAR agonists. It is well recognized that rodents express PPARα at levels approximately ten-fold higher than humans, which might result in an overestimation of efficacy in preclinical models (Liss & Finck, 2017). Furthermore, while pemafibrate’s favorable safety profile is encouraging, the long-term effects on liver histology, particularly in terms of reversing fibrosis or improving NASH-related outcomes, have yet to be thoroughly demonstrated in large-scale clinical trials. Some studies also suggest that despite improvements in metabolic and biochemical parameters, pemafibrate may not significantly reduce the total hepatic triglyceride content in certain models, implying that its therapeutic benefit might be more related to altering lipid turnover and reducing inflammation rather than directly clearing hepatic fat (Sasaki et al., 2020).

Another challenge lies in the multifactorial nature of NASH. The pathogenesis of NASH is not solely driven by dysregulated lipid metabolism but also involves inflammatory cascades, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and immune cell crosstalk. Therefore, a compound that principally targets PPARα may need to be used in combination with other therapies that address these additional pathways—such as agents targeting PPARγ or SGLT2 inhibitors—to achieve comprehensive disease control. However, the selective mechanism of pemafibrate provides a well-defined foundation on which to build such combination strategies.

In summary, pemafibrate’s strong points include its high potency and receptor selectivity leading to enhanced transcriptional activation of key mitochondrial beta-oxidation genes, a favorable pharmacological and ADME profile, and promising early clinical signals in improving liver enzyme levels and lipid profiles. Its mechanism of action is soundly based on decades of research implicating PPARα in the regulation of hepatic fatty acid metabolism and inflammation, and preclinical data support its role in mitigating the pathophysiological processes underlying NASH. Conversely, potential weaknesses include species differences that might limit the translation of preclinical efficacy to humans, the need for more robust evidence of histological improvement in NASH, and the likelihood that monotherapy with a PPARα modulator may not fully address the multifaceted nature of NASH pathology. Given these considerations, pemafibrate represents a promising therapeutic candidate for NASH, but its future development will require carefully designed clinical trials that evaluate not only biochemical endpoints but also detailed histopathological outcomes, ideally in combination with agents that target complementary pathways in this complex disease (Honda et al., 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; Shinozaki et al., 2020; Sasaki et al., 2020).

PXL770 (Mydicar),"Proposal for PXL770 (Mydicar)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
PXL770, also known as Mydicar, is a novel small‐molecule compound belonging to the class of direct AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators. It was developed by Poxel SA through iterative medicinal chemistry approaches aimed at identifying compounds that directly bind to the allosteric drug and metabolite (ADaM) site on the AMPK heterotrimer. PXL770 exhibits high specificity for AMPK complexes, particularly showing approximately 20‐fold greater potency for the β1 subunit compared to β2 isoforms (Romero et al., 2020). This selective profile is fundamental since the β1 isoform is predominantly expressed in rodent hepatocytes and is implicated in the regulation of lipid metabolism, whereas in humans, even though β2 isoforms are more abundant in hepatocytes, β1‐selective activation seems sufficient to modulate metabolic pathways without eliciting off-target cardiac effects. AMPK activators as a class have been explored in metabolic disorders owing to their role as master regulators of cellular energy homeostasis. Prior research in this class has targeted conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and fatty liver diseases by promoting beneficial shifts from anabolic to catabolic processes. PXL770’s mechanism, as a direct allosteric activator, distinguishes it from indirect AMPK activators such as metformin, ensuring a robust and targeted modulation of metabolic enzymes such as acetyl‐CoA carboxylase (ACC) (Romero et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of PXL770 and similar direct AMPK activators is rooted in extensive preclinical research and early clinical studies focused on metabolic conditions, including Non‐Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form, Non‐Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). Preclinical studies in rodent models of NASH demonstrated that PXL770 effectively activates AMPK in hepatocytes, leading to a cascade of beneficial effects including decreased de novo lipogenesis (DNL), reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation, and lower levels of liver injury markers such as ALT and AST (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, early-phase clinical trials (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019) have provided proof-of-concept evidence for target engagement in human subjects. In these trials, subjects with NAFLD or insulin resistance achieved plasma exposure levels considered sufficient for liver AMPK activation, which correlated with improvements in metabolic endpoints, such as enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced DNL as measured by stable isotope methodologies (Fouqueray et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). While PXL770 has not yet been approved for the treatment of NASH or NAFLD, its use in phase 1 and early-phase PK/PD studies, along with advances in understanding the utility of AMPK activation in metabolic regulation, underscores its promise as a therapeutic candidate. AMPK activators have also been evaluated in the context of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases, further supporting the rationale for repurposing them for NASH, where metabolic dysfunction and hepatic lipid overload play central roles (Anggreini et al., 2022; Fouqueray et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
PXL770 exerts its pharmacological effects by directly activating AMPK, an enzyme that acts as a cellular energy sensor and regulator of several metabolic pathways. Under normal physiological conditions, AMPK is activated by an increase in the AMP/ADP to ATP ratio, usually in response to energy deprivation. However, PXL770 bypasses the upstream energy-sensing events by binding directly to the ADaM site located at the interface between the catalytic α- and regulatory β-subunits of AMPK. This binding promotes a conformational change that enhances AMPK’s kinase activity (Romero et al., 2020). Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates key downstream substrates such as ACC. Phosphorylation of ACC results in its inhibition, leading to a marked decrease in the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA is a critical intermediate that not only serves as a substrate for de novo lipogenesis but also acts to inhibit carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), the enzyme responsible for transporting long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for β-oxidation. Consequently, the inhibition of ACC by AMPK activation with PXL770 reduces malonyl-CoA levels, thereby disinhibiting CPT1. This promotion of CPT1 activity enhances mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids, decreasing the lipid burden in hepatocytes, which is a hallmark of NASH (Chen et al., 2024; Anggreini et al., 2022).

At the molecular level, the effect of PXL770 is multifaceted. Besides the suppression of de novo lipogenesis, activated AMPK also modulates the expression and activity of several transcription factors and enzymes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. For example, AMPK can inhibit sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP), which are key regulators of lipogenic gene expression. This inhibition further contributes to decreased synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides in the liver. Additionally, AMPK activation has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects by modulating signaling pathways such as NF-κB, which reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the context of NASH, where inflammation and fibrosis are notable features, these anti-inflammatory properties could potentially ameliorate disease progression (Desjardins, 2023; Anggreini et al., 2022).

The biochemical intricacies involved with PXL770's mechanism have been corroborated by both preclinical biochemical studies and translational clinical PK/PD assessments. In liver biopsies from treated subjects, increased levels of phosphorylated ACC (p-ACC) have been observed, serving as a direct biomarker for AMPK activation. This biochemical evidence—manifested by the cascade from PXL770 binding to AMPK, through ACC phosphorylation, culminating in the biochemical shifts in malonyl-CoA and fatty acid oxidation—is central to the compound's therapeutic rationale in NASH (Fouqueray et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis driving the development of PXL770 for the treatment of NASH is that its direct activation of AMPK will lead to a reduction in hepatic steatosis and inflammation through a well-defined metabolic pathway. By phosphorylating and inhibiting ACC, PXL770 is expected to decrease intracellular malonyl-CoA concentrations, thereby releasing the inhibition on CPT1. This disinhibition is anticipated to enhance the mitochondrial uptake and β-oxidation of fatty acids, reducing the accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes—a central feature of steatosis in NASH (Anggreini et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2024).

In vitro assays conducted in primary hepatocytes have indicated that AMPK activation by PXL770 reduces markers of de novo lipogenesis, while in preclinical animal models, administration of PXL770 has resulted in a decrease in hepatic triglyceride levels, lower ALT and AST levels, and reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, improvements in insulin sensitivity have been reported, as measured by indices such as HOMA-IR and enhancements in oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) parameters, which are relevant because insulin resistance is a critical component of NASH pathogenesis (Fouqueray et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Given that hepatocytes in NASH patients exhibit impaired lipid oxidation and heightened de novo lipogenesis, the expected effect of PXL770 is twofold: first, by boosting mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, it should directly lower hepatic lipid content, thereby reducing steatosis; second, by exerting anti-inflammatory effects via downstream AMPK-dependent signaling, it should contribute to ameliorating the inflammatory milieu and potentially reducing fibrogenesis in the liver. This combinatorial action addresses both the metabolic and inflammatory dimensions of NASH pathology, potentially translating into improved liver histology and better overall metabolic health in treated individuals (Fouqueray et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of PXL770 as a therapeutic candidate for NASH is promising based on the convergence of robust preclinical and early clinical evidence that supports its mechanism of action and translational potential. One of the primary strengths of PXL770 is its direct activation of AMPK, which affords a high degree of mechanistic specificity. By directly engaging the ADaM site on AMPK, PXL770 bypasses the need for upstream kinase activation and delivers a more predictable and potent modulation of the pivotal metabolic enzyme. This specificity translates into a strong biochemical rationale for its use in NASH, where excessive de novo lipogenesis and impaired fatty acid oxidation are central derangements. The resultant effects on ACC phosphorylation, decreased malonyl-CoA production, and enhanced CPT1-mediated fatty acid oxidation have been confirmed in both animal models and early-phase clinical studies, where favorable changes in hepatic lipid profiles and insulin sensitivity have been documented (Fouqueray et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2024).

Furthermore, the clinical PK/PD studies of PXL770 have demonstrated sufficient plasma exposure to achieve target engagement in the liver, as evidenced by elevated p-ACC levels in liver biopsies, which bolster the translational credibility of the preclinical findings. The evidence that PXL770 not only reduces hepatic triglyceride accumulation but also improves systemic insulin sensitivity is particularly attractive, given the multifaceted nature of NASH pathogenesis, which involves both metabolic dysfunction and inflammatory processes (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019).

Despite these strengths, several challenges and potential weaknesses need to be addressed before advancing PXL770 further in clinical development for NASH. First, while early-phase studies have shown encouraging biochemical and metabolic improvements, longer-term clinical trials will be essential to determine whether these changes translate into meaningful improvements in liver histology, fibrosis, and clinical outcomes in NASH patients. The current data mainly focus on surrogate endpoints such as decreased DNL and improved insulin sensitivity, but definitive outcomes related to inflammation and fibrosis remain to be fully elucidated (Fouqueray et al., 2021). Second, systemic activation of AMPK, although desirable for correcting metabolic dysfunction, may potentially result in off-target effects in tissues other than the liver. However, PXL770’s preferential activation of the β1 isoform (which is more prominent in the liver in relevant preclinical models) may help mitigate this risk, although this remains to be assessed through comprehensive safety evaluations in larger, longer-duration trials (Romero et al., 2020; Mather et al., 2024).

Another consideration is the heterogeneity observed in clinical responses among NASH patients. Early studies have suggested that “DNL responders”—patients with more pronounced baseline metabolic dysfunction—might experience greater benefit from AMPK activation. This differential response underscores the need for biomarkers that can identify patient subgroups most likely to benefit from PXL770. Moreover, while the anti-inflammatory effects of AMPK activation are promising, the complexity of inflammatory signaling in NASH requires further investigation to fully define how PXL770 may influence pathways such as NF-κB and cytokine production over extended treatment periods (Anggreini et al., 2022; Fouqueray et al., 2021).

In summary, PXL770 presents a well-founded therapeutic candidate for NASH based on its direct AMPK activation, confirmed biochemical action on ACC and downstream metabolic pathways, and early clinical evidence demonstrating improvements in hepatic lipid handling and insulin sensitivity. The strengths lie in its mechanistic specificity, translational PK/PD alignment, and promising preclinical and phase 1b results. However, the true therapeutic value of PXL770 will depend on its ability to produce sustained histological improvements in NASH, an acceptable long-term safety profile, and identification of the patient populations most likely to benefit from its unique mode of action. Overall, PXL770 represents a promising candidate that merits further investment in clinical trials while carefully monitoring efficacy endpoints and potential systemic effects (Fouqueray et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Desjardins, 2023).

Bempedoic Acid (Esperion Therapeutics),"Proposal for Bempedoic Acid (Esperion Therapeutics)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Bempedoic acid is an orally administered, synthetic, first‐in‐class lipid‐lowering agent developed by Esperion Therapeutics. It was originally discovered through phenotypic screening strategies aimed at identifying compounds capable of inhibiting enzymes involved in lipogenesis, and it belongs to the class of ATP‐citrate lyase (ACLY) inhibitors. As a prodrug, bempedoic acid is selectively converted in the liver to its active CoA derivative by the enzyme very long‐chain acyl‐CoA synthetase 1 (ACSVL1), an enzyme expressed predominantly in hepatocytes and absent in skeletal muscle, thereby conferring liver specificity and limiting muscle toxicity common with other lipid‐lowering agents such as statins (Butera et al., 2024; Batchuluun et al., 2022). Chemically, it is a modified dicarboxylic acid derivative that, after activation, directly inhibits ACLY. This enzyme is a critical mediator that links carbohydrate metabolism to de novo lipogenesis by catalyzing the conversion of citrate to acetyl‐CoA and oxaloacetate, the former being a key building block for both cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. Historically, compounds modulating the ACLY pathway have been explored for their ability to impact dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome, and bempedoic acid represents the latest iteration in this therapeutic class with a demonstrated clinical efficacy for lowering low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) in patients with hypercholesterolemia (Biolo et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Bempedoic acid has a robust therapeutic history as a lipid‐lowering agent. It has been evaluated extensively in phase II and III clinical trials for its efficacy in reducing LDL‐C levels in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and in those with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, particularly among individuals who are statin‐intolerant (Penson et al., 2017; Ruscica et al., 2022). The agent consistently lowers LDL‐C by approximately 15–25 % with monotherapy and can achieve up to 38 % reduction when combined with ezetimibe. In addition, decreases in inflammatory markers such as high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP) have been documented, suggesting that bempedoic acid exerts beneficial anti‐inflammatory effects in addition to its lipid‐lowering activity (Yang, 2020). Although its primary clinical utility has centered on dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk reduction, preclinical studies have also demonstrated improvements in hepatic lipid profiles in rodent models. There is emerging evidence from early‐phase studies and registered trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023; Unknown Reference) that bempedoic acid may be repurposed to treat metabolic liver diseases such as non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by virtue of its ability to modulate hepatic lipogenesis. Thus, while bempedoic acid is already approved for lipid‐lowering in humans, its application to NASH is based on a growing body of preclinical evidence and early clinical insights which support its role in ameliorating hepatic steatosis and inflammation.

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of bempedoic acid is well characterized at the molecular level. Upon oral administration, the prodrug undergoes activation in the liver by ACSVL1 to form bempedoyl‐CoA, its active metabolite. Bempedoyl‐CoA competitively inhibits ATP‐citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby reducing the conversion of citrate to acetyl‐CoA in the cytosol (Biolo et al., 2022; Penson et al., 2017). Since acetyl‐CoA is the fundamental substrate for both cholesterol biosynthesis and de novo lipogenesis, its reduced availability leads to a decrease in intracellular cholesterol synthesis. Consequently, this reduction in cholesterol triggers a compensatory upregulation of LDL receptors on hepatocyte surfaces, which enhances the clearance of circulating LDL particles from the bloodstream (Butera et al., 2024; Yang, 2020).

Additionally, inhibition of ACLY results in lower production of acetyl‐CoA, which in turn decreases the formation of malonyl‐CoA—a critical intermediate required for fatty acid synthesis. Malonyl‐CoA also functions as a potent inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), the rate‐limiting enzyme necessary for transporting long‐chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for β‐oxidation. Therefore, by lowering malonyl‐CoA levels, bempedoic acid is hypothesized to relieve the inhibitory effect on CPT1, promoting enhanced mitochondrial β‐oxidation of fatty acids in hepatocytes (Butera et al., 2024; Unknown Reference). This dual action—reducing lipogenesis by limiting the supply of substrates and enhancing fatty acid oxidation (FAO) by disinhibiting CPT1—forms the biochemical basis for its potential utility in treating NASH. In preclinical rodent models of steatohepatitis, treatment with bempedoic acid has been associated with reduced markers of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and, in some models, fibrosis, supporting its mechanism of shifting substrate flux away from lipogenesis and towards β‐oxidation (Unknown Reference; Marrs & Anderson, 2020).

Expected Effect:
Given the central role of hepatic lipid accumulation in the pathogenesis of NASH, the expected effect of bempedoic acid in this context is to decrease hepatic steatosis and reduce the inflammatory milieu that contributes to disease progression. The primary hypothesis is that, by inhibiting ACLY, bempedoic acid will reduce cytosolic acetyl‐CoA levels and consequently lower malonyl‐CoA synthesis. Reduced malonyl‐CoA is anticipated to relieve CPT1 inhibition, thereby promoting mitochondrial β‐oxidation of fatty acids. Enhanced FAO should result in a decrease in hepatocellular lipid accumulation, alleviating the lipid‐induced cellular stress that drives inflammatory and fibrotic responses in NASH (Oleksii, 2020; Mohamed Anasdeen et al., 2024).

Furthermore, the anti‐inflammatory effects observed in lipid‐lowering trials—evidenced by reductions in hs-CRP—support the notion that bempedoic acid may mitigate the chronic low‐grade inflammation present in NASH, which is partially fueled by aberrant lipid metabolism (Biolo et al., 2022; Yang, 2020). In hepatocytes, the shift in substrate utilization away from lipogenesis toward β‐oxidation is expected to correct the metabolic imbalance. Key metabolic enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, including CPT1, are expressed in the liver, and their activity is critically regulated by malonyl‐CoA levels. Preclinical data suggest that, with adequate target engagement, bempedoic acid can decrease hepatic lipogenesis while enhancing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation gene expression (Unknown Reference; Susekov et al., 2021). This metabolic reprogramming is supported by biochemical analyses demonstrating decreased citrate flux into lipogenic pathways, with consequent improvements in hepatic lipid profiles and reductions in steatosis in animal models of NASH (Samsoondar et al., 2017; Tummala et al., 2022).

Importantly, while bempedoic acid has been primarily evaluated in clinical trials focused on dyslipidemia, its well‐established safety profile in humans, oral bioavailability, and once‐daily dosing regimen make it an attractive candidate for repurposing in NASH. The expected effect in NASH is thus a twofold improvement: a reduction in hepatic lipid content through decreased lipogenesis and an enhancement in mitochondrial lipid catabolism, both of which are critical for attenuating the progression of steatohepatitis toward fibrosis and cirrhosis (Unknown Reference; Butera et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Bempedoic acid presents several strengths that support its consideration as a promising therapeutic candidate for NASH. First, its mechanism of action is highly relevant to the pathophysiology of NASH. By inhibiting ACLY in the liver, bempedoic acid directly reduces the availability of acetyl‐CoA, a key precursor for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, thereby potentially blunting the process of de novo lipogenesis—a process that is pathologically upregulated in NASH (Biolo et al., 2022; Penson et al., 2017). Second, the consequential reduction in malonyl‐CoA levels, and the resulting disinhibition of CPT1, provide a compelling rationale for enhanced mitochondrial β‐oxidation. This shift in metabolic flux is critical because an increase in β‐oxidation can reduce hepatocellular lipid accumulation, mitigate lipotoxicity, and lower the inflammatory drive that promotes hepatic injury and fibrosis (Butera et al., 2024; Unknown Reference). Third, the clinical efficacy of bempedoic acid in lowering LDL-C and reducing hs-CRP in hyperlipidemia trials provides strong human safety and efficacy data that can be repurposed for NASH, a disorder where metabolic dysregulation is central to disease progression (Yang, 2020; Ruscica et al., 2022). Additionally, the liver‐specific activation minimizes muscle toxicity—a significant advantage over statins—and supports its use in a patient population that may already be burdened by multiple comorbidities (Susekov et al., 2021; Brandts & Ray, 2020).

However, there are several challenges and weaknesses that must be addressed. Although preclinical studies in rodent models have shown improved hepatic lipid profiles and reduced inflammatory indices, direct clinical evidence in humans with NASH is limited. Existing trials to date have focused on dyslipidemia rather than liver endpoints, and while the mechanisms are highly suggestive of benefit, definitive proof of efficacy in NASH through endpoints such as histological improvement in steatosis, ballooning, and fibrosis remains to be established (Unknown Reference). In addition, there may be translational challenges related to differences in hepatic lipid metabolism between rodent models and humans, which could moderate the therapeutic benefits extrapolated from preclinical studies (Marrs & Anderson, 2020; Oleksii, 2020). Furthermore, while its effects on the acetyl‐CoA/malonyl‐CoA/CPT1 axis are well supported by biochemical rationale, detailed mechanistic studies specifically measuring these intermediates in the setting of human NASH are sparse and warrant further investigation (Butera et al., 2024; Unknown Reference).

From a practical standpoint, the oral administration, favorable safety profile in lipid-lowering studies, and the potential for once-daily dosing are significant strengths that could expedite its clinical development for NASH. The repurposing of bempedoic acid for NASH would benefit from an accelerated development path given the unmet need in this patient population and the extensive preclinical data that supports its efficacy in modulating hepatic lipid metabolism (Wołowiec et al., 2024; Agarwala et al., 2021). Nonetheless, the lack of long-term outcome data in hepatic endpoints and the necessity of dose-ranging studies in a NASH-specific population are key weaknesses that must be overcome with additional clinical trials specifically targeting liver histology and metabolic endpoints associated with NASH (Unknown Reference; Samsoondar et al., 2017).

In conclusion, bempedoic acid exhibits a strong mechanistic rationale for repurposing in NASH therapy. Its inhibition of ACLY reduces hepatic acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA availability, which is hypothesized to relieve CPT1 inhibition and promote mitochondrial β-oxidation. In preclinical models, this shift in metabolic substrate utilization corresponds with improvements in hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis markers. Its established clinical safety profile, particularly in the context of hypercholesterolemia, together with its liver-specific activation and anti-inflammatory properties, underpin its promise as a candidate for NASH. However, further dedicated clinical research is needed to directly evaluate its efficacy on hepatic endpoints and to fully characterize its impact on the acetyl-CoA/malonyl-CoA/CPT1/β-oxidation axis in human NASH patients. With these considerations in mind, bempedoic acid is a compelling candidate with significant potential for repurposing toward NASH treatment—a hypothesis that merits rigorous clinical validation via targeted trials (Unknown Reference; Yang, 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of bempedoic acid for the treatment of NASH include its well-established mechanism—selective inhibition of ACLY leading to decreased acetyl-CoA availability, which not only reduces cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis but may also lower malonyl-CoA levels to promote mitochondrial β-oxidation—as well as its documented efficacy in lowering LDL-C and hs-CRP, which indicate secondary anti-inflammatory benefits. Its liver-specific activation also minimizes muscle toxicity, a common drawback of statins. Additionally, the availability of extensive safety data from large-scale lipid-lowering trials supports its potential for safe repurposing in metabolic liver diseases (Biolo et al., 2022; Butera et al., 2024; Yang, 2020). The obvious weakness lies in the current paucity of direct clinical data in NASH populations; the preclinical evidence, while promising, has yet to be fully translated into human trials with robust hepatic endpoints such as histological improvement, fibrosis regression, or long-term liver-related outcomes. There is also the need for further mechanistic studies focused on the exact changes in acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA levels, and CPT1 activity within human liver tissues in NASH (Unknown Reference; Mohamed Anasdeen et al., 2024). Overall, however, the strengths of bempedoic acid—its attractive pharmacokinetic profile, oral dosing, favorable safety record, and plausible mechanistic effects on hepatic lipid metabolism—strongly support further investigation and potential repurposing of this agent for NASH treatment. Future studies should focus on NASH-specific endpoints and mechanistic readouts, which will help to confirm its therapeutic benefit and define its role in the treatment paradigm for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (Marrs & Anderson, 2020; Unknown Reference).

In summary, bempedoic acid holds considerable promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for NASH due to its unique action on ACLY, which has the potential to favorably alter hepatic lipid metabolism by decreasing lipogenesis and enhancing fatty acid oxidation. While its established safety and efficacy in reducing LDL-C in hyperlipidemic patients provide a strong foundation, targeted clinical studies in NASH patients are essential to fully validate its role and to optimize its dosing, efficacy, and long-term outcomes in this challenging metabolic liver disease (Unknown Reference; Yang, 2020).

Metformin (generic),"Proposal for Metformin (generic)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Metformin is a synthetic biguanide first developed in the mid-20th century from the naturally occurring guanidine found in Galega officinalis (commonly known as French lilac) (Kothari et al., 2019). As a member of the biguanide class of compounds, metformin was discovered serendipitously while exploring agents with insulin-sensitizing properties and has since been employed as a first-line therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (Sebastiani & Bhat, 2015). The synthetic nature of metformin involves chemical modifications to the guanidine structure to improve bioavailability and reduce toxicity relative to earlier compounds, and it has become one of the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide due to its well-characterized pharmacokinetics (PK), cost-effectiveness, and favorable safety profile (Zhou et al., 2018). The class of biguanides, including metformin, has historically been used primarily for glycemic control by lowering blood glucose levels, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and reducing hepatic glucose output (Chiu et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Metformin’s established clinical history spans over six decades, during which it has been used extensively in diabetic patients to lower blood glucose levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce complications such as cardiovascular events (Sebastiani & Bhat, 2015; Zhou et al., 2018). Although originally approved for type 2 diabetes, metformin has been studied in a variety of contexts beyond glycemic control, including in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and even as an adjunct in oncology given its potential anti-cancer effects (Tacelli et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021). Importantly, multiple epidemiological studies have suggested that metformin use in diabetic populations is associated with a reduced incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), pointing to its potential utility in metabolic liver diseases (Snyder et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021). There is also a substantial body of preclinical evidence from rodent models demonstrating that metformin reduces hepatic steatosis, improves insulin sensitivity, and modulates pathways relevant to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis (Green et al., 2019; Pinto-García, 2025). Although metformin is not currently approved specifically for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), clinical trials evaluating its efficacy in NAFLD/NASH patients have been implemented (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016) and pilot studies in both adult and pediatric populations have suggested some biochemical and metabolic benefits, despite mixed results in terms of liver histology (Doycheva & Loomba, 2014; Prat & Tsochatzis, 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
Metformin exerts its primary pharmacologic effects by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a central cellular energy sensor that responds to changes in the AMP/ATP ratio (Sebastiani & Bhat, 2015; Ruan et al., 2023). At the molecular level, metformin entry into hepatocytes is mediated primarily by the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1); once inside the cell, it accumulates within mitochondria, where it partially inhibits complex I of the electron transport chain. This inhibition modestly increases the cellular AMP:ATP ratio, which in turn triggers AMPK activation (Zhou et al., 2018; Tacelli et al., 2018). Activated AMPK phosphorylates and inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA (Ahmad & Haque, 2024; Pinyopornpanish et al., 2021). Since malonyl-CoA acts as an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), its reduction by metformin relieves CPT1 inhibition, leading to enhanced transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for β-oxidation (Ahmad & Haque, 2024; Green et al., 2019). This sequence of events—increased fatty acid oxidation, reduced de novo lipogenesis, and improved insulin sensitivity—is foundational to the hypothesis that metformin can counteract the lipid accumulation characteristic of NASH (Pinto-García, 2025; Tacelli et al., 2018). In addition to its primary metabolic effects, metformin has been shown to suppress hepatic inflammation by modulating inflammatory cytokine production and inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-dependent pathways, further supporting its potential anti-NASH properties (Ahmad & Haque, 2024; Sebastiani & Bhat, 2015). Furthermore, metformin affects the gut microbiota, enhancing the production of short-chain fatty acids that may contribute to its systemic beneficial effects on metabolism and inflammation (Tacelli et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mode of action, the hypothesis posits that metformin, by activating hepatic AMPK, will lead to an increase in ACC phosphorylation, thereby decreasing malonyl-CoA levels and relieving the inhibition on CPT1. In NASH hepatocytes, this cascade is expected to enhance mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, thus reducing the accumulation of intrahepatic triglycerides and ameliorating hepatic steatosis (Ahmad & Haque, 2024; Zhou et al., 2018). Since elevated hepatic fat content is a central pathological feature of NASH, the anticipated outcome would include reduced liver fat content, improved liver enzyme profiles (such as decreased ALT and AST), and better insulin sensitivity – all of which have been observed in certain clinical and preclinical studies (Green et al., 2019; Pinyopornpanish et al., 2021). The protein targets in these pathways, including AMPK and ACC, are expressed at significant levels in hepatocytes, which supports the rationale that modulation of these targets by metformin would have a direct impact on fatty acid metabolism (Zhou et al., 2018; Sebastiani & Bhat, 2015). Additionally, epidemiological data that associate metformin use with reduced progression of NAFLD and lower incidence of HCC further reinforce the expected beneficial hepatic and metabolic outcomes in a NASH context (Snyder et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021). In vitro assays using primary human hepatocytes should demonstrate increased levels of phosphorylated ACC and enhanced fatty acid oxidation markers upon metformin exposure, which would correlate with decreased lipid accumulation in these cells (Ahmad & Haque, 2024; Pinyopornpanish et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Metformin emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for NASH based on its well-characterized mechanisms, extensive clinical use in T2DM, and supportive preclinical evidence. One of the primary strengths of metformin is its robust activation of AMPK, which plays a key role in regulating lipid metabolism and is directly implicated in the pathological process of NASH. By reducing hepatic malonyl-CoA levels and disinhibiting CPT1, metformin enhances β-oxidation, potentially mitigating hepatic fat accumulation—a central driver of steatosis in NASH (Pinto-García, 2025; Zhang et al., 2021). Preclinical rodent studies provide compelling evidence of reduced hepatic steatosis with metformin treatment, and epidemiological studies have linked metformin use with improved metabolic outcomes and lower rates of NAFLD progression and HCC in diabetic populations (Ahmad & Haque, 2024; Green et al., 2019).

Furthermore, metformin’s safety profile is a substantial advantage. It has been used for decades in millions of patients with diabetes with relatively few adverse events, which supports its rapid repurposing potential for NASH, a field that currently lacks many approved pharmacotherapies (Sebastiani & Bhat, 2015; Tacelli et al., 2018). The drug’s dosing regimens, known pharmacokinetics, and manageable side-effect profile further enhance its attractiveness as a candidate for systemic metabolic intervention in patients with NAFLD and NASH (Linden et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2018).

However, several weaknesses or challenges must be acknowledged. Although metformin improves systemic metabolic parameters and liver enzyme levels in many studies, the evidence for significant histological improvement in NASH is mixed. Several clinical trials have failed to demonstrate robust regression of fibrosis or steatohepatitis solely with metformin treatment (Snyder et al., 2018; Doycheva & Loomba, 2014). This discrepancy may be due in part to heterogeneous patient populations, differences in study design, and the possibility that metformin’s metabolic effects are more pronounced in early-stage NAFLD rather than in advanced fibrotic NASH. Moreover, while the mechanistic hypothesis is sound from a biochemical perspective, it remains uncertain whether these molecular pathways can be modulated sufficiently in a complex clinical scenario to result in marked histological improvements (Green et al., 2019; Pinyopornpanish et al., 2021).

Another consideration is that clinical studies often show modest weight loss and improvements in insulin sensitivity with metformin, which may indirectly benefit liver fat content; however, without significant weight reduction or additional targeted anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic interventions, the direct benefits on liver histology may be limited (Tacelli et al., 2018; Pinyopornpanish et al., 2021). Additionally, while metformin’s action on AMPK is well established, other molecular pathways contributing to NASH—for instance, those involving lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and hepatic stellate cell activation—may require combination therapy with other agents to achieve a comprehensive therapeutic effect (Okishio et al., 2020; Chiu et al., 2023).

In summary, metformin’s strong safety record, extensive clinical experience, and its multifaceted mechanism of action—including AMPK activation, inhibition of ACC, reduction of malonyl-CoA, and enhancement of CPT1-mediated fatty acid oxidation—support its potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for NASH (Ahmad & Haque, 2024; Zhou et al., 2018). The candidate is particularly attractive for early-stage NAFLD/NASH in patients with concomitant metabolic syndrome or T2DM, and its widespread clinical use facilitates rapid translation into larger multicenter trials (Pinto-García, 2025; Tacelli et al., 2018). However, given the modest improvements observed in liver histology in some clinical studies and the complex pathophysiology of NASH that may not be fully addressed by metformin monotherapy, further rigorous randomized controlled trials exploring combination therapies may be warranted. Overall, metformin remains one of the most promising repurposed drug candidates for NASH based on its biochemical rationale, preclinical efficacy, and proven clinical safety, but its application may be most effective when integrated into multifaceted treatment regimens targeting the broad spectrum of metabolic and inflammatory derangements in NASH (Pinyopornpanish et al., 2021; Green et al., 2019).

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of empagliflozin as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with a focus on its potential to enhance hepatic β‐oxidation through mechanisms that include caloric loss, reduced substrate overload, AMPK activation, and improved mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.","Proposal for Empagliflozin (Boehringer Ingelheim)

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of empagliflozin as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with a focus on its potential to enhance hepatic β‐oxidation through mechanisms that include caloric loss, reduced substrate overload, AMPK activation, and improved mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Empagliflozin is a synthetic small‐molecule agent belonging to the sodium‐glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor class. This agent was originally discovered and synthesized by Boehringer Ingelheim with the primary intent of treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by selectively inhibiting SGLT2—a protein highly expressed in the proximal renal tubules that is responsible for reabsorbing glucose from the glomerular filtrate. The strategy behind the design of empagliflozin was to attain high selectivity for SGLT2 over related transporters, such as SGLT1, to achieve effective glycemic control via the induction of glucosuria, as has been demonstrated in numerous pivotal trials (Lai et al., 2020). In addition to lowering plasma glucose, empagliflozin produces beneficial ancillary effects including modest weight loss, reduction in blood pressure, and notable benefits for cardiovascular and renal outcomes. The extensive use of SGLT2 inhibitors in the management of T2DM and emerging insights into their pleiotropic metabolic actions have driven interest in their application to other metabolic conditions characterized by dysfunctional energy balance and lipid accumulation, such as non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive subset, non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Empagliflozin’s clinical history is rooted in its well‐characterized use as an anti‐diabetic agent. Over years of clinical use, large-scale trials have validated its efficacy in reducing hyperglycemia via an insulin-independent mechanism, with numerous studies also demonstrating reductions in body weight, improvements in blood pressure and favorable cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Although empagliflozin was not initially developed for liver diseases, preclinical studies in rodent models of NASH have revealed encouraging observations. In these studies, treatment with empagliflozin resulted in decreased hepatic steatosis and amelioration of histological features of NASH, including reduced inflammatory markers and fibrosis, along with concomitant activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Elseweidy et al., 2024). Furthermore, several clinical trials in diabetic populations have incorporated imaging endpoints such as MRI–proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) to quantify reductions in liver fat content when patients were treated with empagliflozin (Kuchay et al., 2018). Such evidence supports the evolving concept of repurposing empagliflozin in patients who present with non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis, even if the majority of early studies have been conducted in T2DM populations with accompanying NAFLD. Trials such as those indexed under ClinicalTrials.gov, as well as studies in non-diabetic patients with NAFLD (e.g., NCT04642261), further bolster the rationale behind exploring this drug for hepatic indications. The body of evidence, which combines outcomes from both clinical and preclinical studies, suggests that the safety profile established in T2DM, along with metabolic improvements driven by empagliflozin, may be leveraged for the treatment of NASH.

Mechanism of Action:
Empagliflozin exerts its primary pharmacological action via the inhibition of SGLT2 in the renal proximal tubule. By blocking SGLT2 function, empagliflozin decreases renal glucose reabsorption and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion, producing an insulin-independent reduction in blood glucose levels (Jojima et al., 2016; Lai et al., 2020). This glucosuric effect results in an unintended caloric loss which contributes to a state of negative energy balance. The reduction of circulating glucose and the associated caloric deficit are known to induce mild ketosis and shift substrate utilization away from carbohydrate oxidation toward increased reliance on fatty acids as an energy source. This metabolic shift is hypothesized to reduce substrate overload in hepatocytes—a key contributor to the pathogenesis and progression of NASH—by alleviating the lipotoxic stress that results from oversupply of carbohydrates (Dougherty et al., 2021).

On a molecular level, the mild ketosis and resulting energy deficit promote the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master sensor of cellular energy status that plays a pivotal role in regulating metabolic homeostasis. Once activated, AMPK enhances mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation while simultaneously inhibiting lipogenic pathways via downregulation of key transcription factors such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate-responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) (Chun et al., 2023; Androutsakos et al., 2022). The activation of AMPK leads to a cascade of beneficial metabolic effects including inhibition of de novo lipogenesis, stimulation of β-oxidation, improvement in mitochondrial function, and reduction in oxidative stress. Collectively, these molecular events contribute to a decrease in intracellular triglyceride accumulation and amelioration of hepatic steatosis—a central criterion in the diagnosis and progression of NASH. Moreover, some in vitro studies in hepatocyte-derived cell lines imply that empagliflozin might also positively modulate inflammatory signaling pathways and reduce detrimental protein O-GlcNAcylation in hepatocytes, providing an additional layer of hepatoprotection (Chun et al., 2023; Jojima et al., 2016). Thus, the mechanistic rationale for repurposing empagliflozin in NASH rests on its ability to systemically shift energy balance and promote metabolic processes that favor the breakdown of fatty acids, particularly through enhanced mitochondrial β-oxidation driven by AMPK activation.

Expected Effect:
Based on the detailed biochemical and clinical background, the hypothesis for empagliflozin in NASH is that it will improve hepatic β-oxidation in NASH hepatocytes indirectly through several interrelated mechanisms. First, by reducing blood glucose levels and promoting glucosuria, empagliflozin induces a negative energy balance that leads to caloric loss and a mild state of ketosis. This state inherently forces a metabolic shift wherein cells increasingly utilize fatty acids for energy rather than carbohydrates (Dougherty et al., 2021). In this framework, the decrease in substrate overload in hepatocytes is expected to alleviate lipotoxicity—a primary driver of hepatic inflammation, cell injury, and fibrosis in NASH. As the body compensates for the altered energy availability, activation of AMPK is anticipated; once activated, AMPK boosts mitochondrial β-oxidation by increasing the transcription and activity of enzymes required for fatty acid breakdown while simultaneously suppressing lipogenic enzyme expression (Kaur et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024).

In practical terms, imaging studies—such as those employing MRI-PDFF—have shown that empagliflozin treatment in diabetic patients correlates with reductions in liver fat content, providing indirect evidence for the hypothesized metabolic shift toward enhanced β-oxidation. This outcome is expected to manifest as improved hepatic histological features, including reduced steatosis, diminished inflammatory cell infiltration, and less hepatocyte ballooning, which collectively are surrogate markers of NASH improvement. Although the direct expression of SGLT2 in hepatocytes remains controversial, the metabolic benefits of empagliflozin are primarily derived from its systemic effects, thereby indirectly improving hepatic mitochondrial function. If these mechanisms are confirmed, empagliflozin could contribute not only to reduction of liver fat accumulation but also to an improvement in overall liver function and a potential retardation—or even reversal—of fibrosis progression in NASH patients (Kaur et al., 2023; Dougherty et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Our comprehensive evaluation of empagliflozin, based on the convergence of clinical, biochemical, and preclinical data, suggests that it is a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis. Among its strengths is the well-established efficacy and safety profile in type 2 diabetes populations over years of clinical use, which provides an extensive safety database that reduces the translational risk when repurposing it for NASH (Lai et al., 2020; Kuchay et al., 2018). The mechanistic rationale is robust: empagliflozin lowers plasma glucose via SGLT2 inhibition, inducing glucosuria and resulting in a negative energy balance that not only contributes to weight loss but also shifts substrate utilization toward fatty acids. Such a metabolic shift is crucial because it facilitates the activation of AMPK, triggering enhanced mitochondrial β-oxidation and thus reducing the hepatic lipid burden that is central to NASH pathology (Chun et al., 2023; Jojima et al., 2016). Additionally, preclinical studies have provided supportive evidence where rodent NASH models treated with empagliflozin displayed reductions in steatosis and improvements in inflammatory markers, which are consistent with the expected activity on hepatic β-oxidation (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Elseweidy et al., 2024).

The expected beneficial effects in patients include a reduction in liver fat content as measured by non-invasive imaging modalities such as MRI-PDFF, improvements in liver enzyme profiles, and potentially favorable histological improvements including reductions in hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation, and fibrosis. These effects are hypothesized to be mediated by the combination of reduced substrate overload, increased ketone body production, and the subsequent enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation—a pathway that could decisively counteract the development and progression of NASH (Dougherty et al., 2021; Kaur et al., 2023).

Nonetheless, some weaknesses and knowledge gaps remain. Notably, while many clinical studies have been conducted in T2DM populations with NAFLD and have demonstrated reductions in liver fat parameters, there is a relative paucity of large-scale, placebo-controlled, biopsy-driven randomized controlled trials solely targeting non-diabetic NASH populations. Histological endpoints remain the gold standard for evaluating NASH improvement, yet many studies have relied on surrogate imaging markers (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016, 2021). Moreover, while the systemic metabolic effects of empagliflozin are well understood, the extent to which these effects directly translate to enhanced hepatocyte β-oxidation at a molecular level requires further investigation. Direct measurements of mitochondrial function and specific assays of fatty acid oxidation in human liver tissue are still limited, thereby underscoring the need for additional mechanistic studies.

Another potential limitation is the indirect nature of the drug’s hepatic actions. Since SGLT2 is primarily expressed in renal tissue, the beneficial hepatic effects of empagliflozin are mediated via systemic metabolic shifts rather than through direct receptor engagement in hepatocytes. This proposition implies that while the drug can reduce hepatic substrate overload, its efficacy might vary among individuals based on differences in metabolic status, degree of insulin resistance, and baseline liver fat content (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hüttl et al., 2021). Variability in patient populations and the presence of concomitant therapies may also confound outcomes, necessitating careful patient selection and robust study designs in forthcoming trials.

Given these strengths and limitations, our overall evaluation is cautiously optimistic. Empagliflozin’s well-documented metabolic benefits, supported by a favorable long-term safety profile in T2DM, position it as a strong candidate for repurposing in NASH. The combined effects—ranging from improved glycemic control and weight loss to the activation of AMPK and subsequent enhancement of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation—form a coherent and plausible mechanistic framework that addresses central features of NASH pathophysiology. This multifaceted approach could potentially allow empagliflozin to not only reduce hepatic steatosis but also to improve inflammation and possibly retard fibrosis progression, thereby impacting several dimensions of the disease process (Kaur et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024).

In conclusion, while the evidence to date is encouraging, the transition from T2DM populations with concurrent NAFLD to broader NASH indications—especially in non-diabetic individuals— requires more rigorous clinical trials with biopsy-proven endpoints and longer-term follow-up. Future studies should incorporate detailed mechanistic investigations to directly assess changes in hepatic mitochondrial function and β-oxidation rates and should ideally stratify patients based on metabolic phenotype to better predict response. Nevertheless, based on the confluence of preclinical data, early-phase clinical trials, and robust safety information, empagliflozin emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate in the quest to address the significant unmet medical need in NASH treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kaur et al., 2023; Liu, 2024).

Overall, our comprehensive literature review supports the hypothesis that empagliflozin, through its established mechanism of promoting glycosuria-induced caloric loss and subsequent activation of metabolic pathways (notably through AMPK activation), can shift energy utilization toward enhanced fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes. This effect, in turn, may alleviate hepatic steatosis, reduce inflammation, and ultimately improve histological features of NASH. Although current evidence predominantly arises from diabetic populations and surrogate markers, the confluence of promising preclinical data and early clinical signals justifies the continued investigation of empagliflozin in large-scale, well-controlled trials targeting both diabetic and non-diabetic NASH populations. If ensuing studies confirm these preliminary findings, empagliflozin could represent a significant breakthrough in the pharmacotherapy of NASH, providing clinicians with a repurposed drug candidate that addresses both metabolic dysregulation and liver pathology, thereby fulfilling a critical unmet need in this challenging disease space (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kaur et al., 2023; Liu, 2024).

In summary, the strengths of empagliflozin for NASH treatment lie in its multifactorial metabolic actions—it lowers plasma glucose, induces a mild ketogenic state that favors fatty acid oxidation, promotes weight loss, and possesses robust cardiovascular and renal benefits—all of which are particularly valuable in the context of metabolic liver disease. However, the current limitations include a reliance on data from diabetic cohorts, an indirect mechanism of action on the liver, and incomplete direct evidence linking its use to enhanced hepatocyte β-oxidation in humans. Addressing these gaps through future rigorous clinical and mechanistic studies will be critical in determining whether empagliflozin can ultimately be approved as a therapeutic intervention for NASH. Based on the available evidence and our integrated evaluation, we remain cautiously optimistic and recommend that empagliflozin be advanced into further investigation as a repurposed treatment candidate for NASH.

"Sulforaphane (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #S4441)","Proposal for Sulforaphane (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #S4441)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate first discovered in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, and kale. It is derived from the glucosinolate precursor glucoraphanin through enzymatic hydrolysis catalyzed by the enzyme myrosinase. Chemically, sulforaphane belongs to a class of phytochemicals recognized for their ability to modulate cellular defense mechanisms. This compound is available commercially—in this case, as Sigma-Aldrich Cat. #S4441—and is widely used in research to study its effects on oxidative stress and inflammation. Its purification and synthesis have been standardized, allowing reproducible dosing in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Dietary supplements and experimental pharmacological formulations of sulforaphane often focus on its capacity to activate the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway—a master regulator of antioxidant and cytoprotective gene expression (Yan & Yan, 2023, pp. 2–3). Historically, sulforaphane has been utilized as a nutraceutical agent and experimental compound in studies examining its chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory properties, underscoring its potential repurposing for metabolic liver diseases such as non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Sulforaphane has a well-established history in biochemical and clinical literature as an activator of the Nrf2 pathway, with studies demonstrating that it upregulates phase II detoxification enzymes and antioxidant enzymes in various cell types, including hepatocytes. Preclinical investigations have revealed that in rodent models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its more severe form, NASH, sulforaphane treatment leads to reductions in liver steatosis, fibrosis, and oxidative stress, which are hallmarks of the disease (Wu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2, 7–10). Early clinical evaluations, while not directly targeting NASH, have suggested that sulforaphane exerts a favorable safety profile in humans when delivered as broccoli sprout extract formulations, which supports its feasibility for repurposing in liver diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; University of Oxford, 2020). Additionally, biochemical studies have confirmed that sulforaphane stimulates the antioxidant response in liver cells, and several clinical trials have either incorporated sulforaphane as an adjuvant therapy for conditions involving oxidative stress or have demonstrated its low toxicity in humans (Yan & Yan, 2023, p. 9). Although direct clinical trials focused exclusively on NASH remain limited, the convergence of positive preclinical results across multiple models of fatty liver disease suggests that the therapeutic history of sulforaphane—coupled with its repurposing in other oxidative stress–driven conditions—provides a strong precedent for its potential use in NASH (Galicia-Moreno et al., 2020, pp. 7–9; Ponnusamy et al., 2014, pp. 3–5).

Mechanism of Action:
Sulforaphane’s primary mode of action is the activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is bound in the cytoplasm by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) which targets it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Sulforaphane interacts with critical cysteine thiols on Keap1, inducing conformational changes that disrupt the Keap1–Nrf2 complex and allow Nrf2 to escape degradation. Once liberated, Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus where it heterodimerizes with small musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (sMAF) proteins and binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of its target genes (Galicia-Moreno et al., 2020, pp. 3–5; Ponnusamy et al., 2014, pp. 1–2). This transcriptional activation leads to the upregulation of a battery of cytoprotective and phase II detoxification enzymes, including glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalase, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (Yan & Yan, 2023, pp. 3–4; Xu et al., 2019, pp. 5–7). Additionally, evidence suggests that sulforaphane can influence metabolic pathways through interactions with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and by modulating inflammatory signaling cascades such as NF-κB, thereby indirectly improving mitochondrial function and fatty acid oxidation (Wu et al., 2022, pp. 7–10; Galicia-Moreno et al., 2020, pp. 17–19). The activation of Nrf2 by sulforaphane is typically observed at nanomolar concentrations, reflecting its high potency. Direct target engagement has been confirmed via assays using ARE luciferase reporters, which show robust activation upon treatment with sulforaphane (Yan & Yan, 2023, p. 10). This molecular cascade thereby reduces oxidative damage to key cellular components, including enzymes involved in β-oxidation, and enhances the overall antioxidant capacity of hepatocytes (Ponnusamy et al., 2014, pp. 3–5; Xu et al., 2019, pp. 11–12).

Expected Effect:
Based on its known mechanism, the expected effect of sulforaphane in the context of NASH is multifaceted. In hepatocytes affected by NASH, increased oxidative stress results in damage to mitochondrial proteins and β-oxidation enzymes, thereby impairing fatty acid oxidation and promoting lipid accumulation. Sulforaphane’s activation of the Nrf2 pathway is anticipated to upregulate the expression of antioxidant enzymes (such as GSTs, SODs, catalase, NQO1, and HO-1) which in turn would neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduce oxidative damage (Yan & Yan, 2023, pp. 7–8; Xu et al., 2019, pp. 11–12). With reduced oxidative damage, β-oxidation enzymes would be preserved, leading to improved mitochondrial function and enhanced fatty acid oxidation. In preclinical rodent models of NASH, sulforaphane treatment correlates with a decrease in liver steatosis, improved histological markers, and reduced markers of fibrosis and inflammation (Wu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Galicia-Moreno et al., 2020, pp. 7–9). Furthermore, sulforaphane has been shown to enhance mitochondrial respiration without adversely affecting the basal bioenergetic state of the organelles, suggesting that its protective effects are specifically due to its antioxidant properties rather than nonspecific metabolic suppression (Greco et al., 2011, pp. 4–5). In in vitro hepatocyte assays, one would expect to observe increased levels of nuclear Nrf2, induction of ARE-driven genes, decreased lipid peroxidation markers, and preserved activity of enzymes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (Xu et al., 2019, pp. 5–7; Yan & Yan, 2023, pp. 11–12). This mechanism directly aligns with the therapeutic hypothesis that sulforaphane, via Nrf2 activation, supports enhanced fatty acid clearance and reduction of steatotic burden, all of which are crucial endpoints in the treatment of NASH.

Overall Evaluation:
Sulforaphane, as a repurposed candidate for the treatment of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis, presents a number of attractive qualities based on both biochemical and preclinical evidence. Its high potency as an Nrf2 activator allows it to bolster the liver’s endogenous antioxidant mechanisms at low concentrations, a benefit that has been demonstrated in multiple rodent models of steatohepatitis (Wu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Ponnusamy et al., 2014, pp. 3–5). The compound’s ability to upregulate phase II detoxification enzymes and protect mitochondrial function is directly aligned with the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of NASH, where oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and inflammation play pivotal roles (Galicia-Moreno et al., 2020, pp. 17–19; Xu et al., 2019, pp. 11–12). Previous studies highlight that sulforaphane reduces hepatic steatosis and fibrosis while improving mitochondrial respiration—a profile that makes it especially promising as a therapeutic agent for metabolic liver diseases (Wu et al., 2022, pp. 7–10; Yan & Yan, 2023, pp. 9–10).

Strengths of sulforaphane include its natural origin and favorable safety profile observed in early clinical testing for other indications, which supports its potential repurposing in NASH (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; University of Oxford, 2020; Yan & Yan, 2023, p. 9). The robust preclinical evidence, including direct target engagement via ARE luciferase assays, indicates that sulforaphane consistently activates Nrf2 at nanomolar concentrations, underscoring its potency and specificity (Yan & Yan, 2023, p. 10; Ponnusamy et al., 2014, pp. 1–2). In addition, its multifaceted mechanism of action not only targets oxidative stress through Nrf2 activation but also modulates inflammatory pathways and improves mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, addressing multiple pathological facets of NASH concurrently (Xu et al., 2019, pp. 5–7; Wu et al., 2022, pp. 7–10).

However, there are also weaknesses that must be carefully considered. One of the main limitations is the relative paucity of clinical trials specifically investigating sulforaphane in NASH patients, meaning that while preclinical data are promising, direct clinical efficacy evidence in this context remains limited (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; University of Oxford, 2020). Moreover, the bioavailability of sulforaphane can be variable, particularly when delivered via natural extracts such as broccoli sprout preparations, which may complicate dosing regimens and therapeutic consistency (Yan & Yan, 2023, pp. 2–3). Formulation challenges—such as poor water solubility and rapid metabolism—necessitate further research into optimized delivery systems to ensure maximal target tissue exposure and consistent Nrf2 activation (Yan & Yan, 2023, pp. 4–7). Furthermore, while the safety profile in other human studies is encouraging, long-term effects and efficacy in the specific clinical setting of NASH require additional rigorous evaluation.

In summary, the comprehensive literature review strongly supports that sulforaphane has considerable potential as a therapeutic candidate for NASH. Its mechanism as an Nrf2 activator leads to upregulated antioxidant defense, reduced oxidative damage, and improved mitochondrial function—all critical for ameliorating the pathogenesis of NASH. The preclinical studies consistently demonstrate improvements in liver histology and metabolic parameters with sulforaphane treatment, and its excellent safety profile in preliminary clinical studies further supports its repurposing. Despite challenges related to bioavailability and the need for NASH-specific clinical trials, sulforaphane represents a promising, multifaceted agent that merits further investigation through both advanced preclinical studies and well-designed clinical trials targeting NASH patients (Wu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Xu et al., 2019, pp. 11–12; Yan & Yan, 2023, pp. 7–8; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

MitoQ (Antipodean Pharmaceuticals),"Proposal for MitoQ (Antipodean Pharmaceuticals)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MitoQ is a mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant that was developed by covalently linking the antioxidant moiety of ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q10) to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) cation. This design exploits the large negative membrane potential inside mitochondria, enabling selective accumulation of MitoQ within the mitochondrial matrix. It belongs to the broader class of mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants, a group of compounds designed to overcome the limitations of conventional antioxidants by concentrating their activity at the primary site of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This synthetic molecule was discovered through efforts to address mitochondrial oxidative stress by directly scavenging ROS in situ, and its successful design has paved the way for related compounds with improved cellular uptake and targeted delivery. MitoQ is synthesized through chemical modifications of naturally occurring ubiquinone, and the incorporation of the TPP⁺ moiety confers high lipid solubility and a positive charge that drives its accumulation in the negatively charged inner mitochondrial membrane. Historically, compounds of this class have been investigated for their ability to mitigate oxidative stress in various disease models and have been used in preclinical studies addressing metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disorders (Ajith, 2018; Amorim, 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants like MitoQ have been employed in numerous preclinical studies to ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in conditions linked to metabolic syndrome, liver disease, and cardiovascular disorders. Preclinical studies in rodent models have shown that oral administration of MitoQ leads to marked improvements in markers of liver mitochondrial function, including increased expression of cardiolipin synthase and preservation of mitochondrial membrane integrity. Moreover, studies in rats fed high‐fat diets have demonstrated that MitoQ treatment ameliorates features of metabolic syndrome, reducing hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, steatosis, and even mitochondrial DNA oxidative damage—a constellation of effects relevant to the pathogenesis of Non‐alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) (Ajith, 2018; Mitchell & Darley-Usmar, 2012). In addition, similar benefits have been observed in other animal models where MitoQ improved mitochondrial bioenergetics and reduced inflammation. Clinical trials have also explored the safety and potential efficacy of MitoQ in humans in the context of oxidative stress‐related conditions, such as in chronic hepatitis C where it reduced liver enzyme levels, suggesting hepatic benefits (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2010). The compound’s repurposing as a candidate for NASH is bolstered by evidence from metabolic disease models and by its translational safety profile in phase II studies in other metabolic conditions, making it a promising candidate for further development in liver diseases with a high oxidative stress component (Ajith, 2018; Xiang et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
MitoQ’s mechanism of action is multifaceted, centering on its capacity to reduce mitochondrial ROS levels while preserving mitochondrial function. Once administered, the TPP⁺ moiety drives the selective uptake of MitoQ into mitochondria through the exploitation of the negative electrical potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Within the mitochondrial matrix, the ubiquinone moiety of MitoQ is enzymatically reduced to its active ubiquinol form by complex II of the electron transport chain (ETC) without promoting harmful free radical formation. This redox cycling allows MitoQ to effectively act as an ROS scavenger, neutralizing damaging species such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and peroxynitrite that are elevated in diseased hepatocytes in NASH (Ajith, 2018; Teixeira et al., 2018).
At a molecular level, excessive ROS in NASH not only lead to direct damage of mitochondrial DNA, proteins, and lipids (e.g., cardiolipin) but also result in the inactivation of key enzymes involved in β-oxidation, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. By reducing ROS levels, MitoQ is hypothesized to safeguard these enzymes from oxidative modifications, thereby preserving β-oxidation capacity—a critical process for the breakdown and utilization of fatty acids in hepatocytes (Ajith, 2018; Xiang et al., 2021).
Furthermore, by protecting mitochondrial membranes and improving overall mitochondrial respiration, MitoQ indirectly supports improved ATP production and metabolic efficiency. Enhanced mitochondrial quality control is also a downstream effect, as reduced oxidative damage promotes efficient mitophagy and ensures the retention of a healthy mitochondrial population within the liver cells (Pang et al., 2025; Maseko, 2024). The biochemical cascade initiated by MitoQ ultimately dampens inflammatory signaling pathways, such as those mediated by NF-κB and TGF-β1, leading to attenuation of steatosis and fibrogenesis observed in preclinical models of NASH (Amorim, 2022).
The direct interaction of MitoQ in the electron transport chain, along with its protective role against lipid peroxidation, helps maintain mitochondrial cristae structure and enzyme function, offering a cohesive mitigation of the vicious cycle of oxidative damage that drives NASH progression (Teixeira et al., 2018; Xiang et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
Based on the detailed mechanistic insights, the expected effect of MitoQ in a NASH setting is multifactorial. First, by scavenging mitochondrial ROS, MitoQ should lead to a measurable decrease in oxidative stress markers in hepatocytes derived from NASH patients or animal models. This reduction in ROS is anticipated to directly prevent oxidative inactivation of enzymes critical for β-oxidation, such as CPT1 and acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, thereby enhancing the breakdown and utilization of fatty acids (Ajith, 2018; Pang et al., 2025). Hepatocytes, which have high expression of CPT1 and other β-oxidation enzymes, are expected to exhibit restored mitochondrial functionality as evidenced by improved oxygen consumption rates and normalized ATP production following MitoQ treatment.
Second, the preservation of mitochondrial membrane integrity through the prevention of lipid peroxidation will maintain proper electron transport chain operations and mitochondrial dynamics, including fission, fusion, and mitophagy. This re-establishment of mitochondrial homeostasis is crucial for sustaining fatty acid oxidation and reducing intracellular lipid accumulation—a defining feature of NASH (Maseko, 2024; Xiang et al., 2021).
Furthermore, by mitigating the oxidative and inflammatory milieu within the liver, MitoQ is expected to reduce cytokine expression (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6) and fibrogenic mediators (e.g., TGF-β1), thereby attenuating liver inflammation and fibrosis. This effect is supported by preclinical data in rodent models, where MitoQ administration correlated with decreased hepatic steatosis, improved histological scores, and reduced markers of fibrosis (Ajith, 2018; Turkseven et al., 2023).
Finally, the improvement in mitochondrial β-oxidation is anticipated to facilitate sustained fatty acid oxidation, which in turn should decrease the lipid burden in hepatocytes and prevent progression to more severe forms of NASH. The overall clinical benefits could include normalization of liver enzyme profiles, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced progression of fibrosis, which are highly relevant endpoints in clinical assessments of NASH therapies (Zheng et al., 2023; Pang et al., 2025).

Overall Evaluation:
MitoQ represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for Non‐alcoholic Steatohepatitis based on its targeted mechanism of action and promising preclinical data. One of the principal strengths of MitoQ is its unique design that allows for selective accumulation within mitochondria, the primary site of ROS generation in hepatocytes affected by NASH. This targeted delivery enhances its antioxidant potency, enabling protection of mitochondrial lipids, proteins, and DNA from oxidative damage that would otherwise impair fatty acid β-oxidation and overall mitochondrial bioenergetics (Ajith, 2018; Teixeira et al., 2018).
Another major advantage is the robust preclinical evidence demonstrating improved mitochondrial respiration, preservation of mitochondrial integrity, and attenuation of liver steatosis and inflammation in various rodent models of metabolic syndrome and NASH. These findings are further supported by clinical safety data from phase II trials in metabolic diseases, which indicate that MitoQ is well tolerated and achieves effective target engagement in human subjects (Mitchell & Darley-Usmar, 2012; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2010).
Moreover, the compound’s multifaceted mechanism—encompassing ROS scavenging, prevention of enzyme inactivation, preservation of mitochondrial dynamics, and attenuation of pro-inflammatory signaling—directly addresses the root pathogenic processes involved in NASH. This integrated action is particularly valuable given the complex etiology of NASH, which involves metabolic dysregulation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cascades that ultimately lead to fibrosis (Amorim, 2022; Xiang et al., 2021).
However, there are several challenges that must be acknowledged. One potential weakness is the relative scarcity of direct clinical trial data in NASH populations. Although phase II trials in other metabolic conditions suggest safety and potential efficacy, the translation of preclinical benefits to significant clinical outcomes in NASH patients remains to be rigorously demonstrated (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2010). In addition, while MitoQ effectively reduces oxidative stress, the long‐term effects of chronic mitochondrial antioxidant therapy are not fully known, and there is a theoretical risk that excessive ROS scavenging might inadvertently impair physiological redox signaling necessary for normal cellular functions.
Furthermore, questions remain regarding the optimal dosing regimen, pharmacokinetic properties, and potential for off-target effects when used in a chronic disease setting such as NASH. The heterogeneity of NASH in human patients could also influence therapeutic response, making it essential to identify proper patient subpopulations for clinical trials. Despite these concerns, the comprehensive biochemical rationale, extensive preclinical evidence, and favorable safety profile position MitoQ as a strong candidate worthy of further investigation in the context of NASH (Ajith, 2018; Pang et al., 2025; Xiang et al., 2021).

In conclusion, the evaluation of MitoQ as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Non‐alcoholic Steatohepatitis reveals a compound with a compelling mechanism centered on the preservation of mitochondrial integrity and function. Its ability to scavenge mitochondrial ROS, protect key β-oxidation enzymes, and reduce inflammatory signaling has been demonstrated preclinically in models that closely mimic human NASH. While additional clinical data are needed to definitively establish its efficacy in NASH patients, the accumulated evidence supports its potential to address a fundamental pathological driver of the disease. Given the unmet medical need for effective and safe NASH therapies, further development of MitoQ—through rigorous clinical trial designs and biomarker-driven patient selection—is warranted to fully determine its place in the therapeutic landscape for NASH (Ajith, 2018; Xiang et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2023).

"Mito-TEMPO (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #SML0737)","Proposal for Mito-TEMPO (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #SML0737)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Mito‐TEMPO is a synthetic, mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant developed by conjugating the stable piperidine nitroxide TEMPOL to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) cation via an aliphatic five‐carbon linker. This chemical design was created expressly so that the antioxidant moiety can be selectively delivered into the mitochondrial matrix by capitalizing on the large negative membrane potential that characterizes mitochondria. Experimental evidence demonstrates that such conjugation enables Mito‐TEMPO to concentrate within mitochondria at levels 100–500 times that achieved in the cytosol (Amorim, 2022). As a member of the mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant class, Mito‐TEMPO was designed to overcome the limitations associated with systemic antioxidants; many conventional antioxidants, including vitamin E, do not accumulate within mitochondria at effective concentrations and thus fail to counteract the oxidative insults that initiate mitochondrial damage (Ajith, 2018). The origin of Mito‐TEMPO lies in decades of research focused on the molecular pathology of diseases driven by oxidative stress, particularly within the organelles responsible for energy metabolism. By linking the catalytic redox‐active TEMPOL molecule to TPP⁺, researchers have developed a compound that not only acts as a scavenger for reactive oxygen species (ROS) but also stabilizes the redox environment of mitochondria, thereby protecting key proteins, lipids, and mitochondrial DNA (Ajith, 2018; Xiang et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History
Over the past several years, mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants have drawn considerable attention as potential therapeutic agents across a wide range of oxidative stress‐linked pathologies including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders. In preclinical studies, Mito‐TEMPO in particular has been evaluated for its ability to attenuate oxidative damage in liver tissue, with a focus on Non‐alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and its more severe progression to Non‐alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). Several animal studies have reported that Mito‐TEMPO effectively reduces hepatic ROS levels, leading to decreased lipid peroxidation and inflammation in rodent models of diet‐induced steatohepatitis (Ajith, 2018). In these models, administration of Mito‐TEMPO correlates with lower levels of oxidative stress markers and improved mitochondrial function. Preclinical experiments in hepatocyte cultures have demonstrated that exposure to Mito‐TEMPO results in restoration of crucial enzymes involved in β‐oxidation, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and acyl‐CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs), by reducing protein carbonylation and other oxidative modifications (Ajith, 2018; Xiang et al., 2021). Although there is not yet any published clinical trial data specifically addressing the therapeutic use of Mito‐TEMPO in NASH, its in vivo tolerability has been demonstrated in several oxidative stress models (Rehman, 2016; Loureiro, 2022). Additionally, related compounds and proof‐of‐concept studies have provided a historical precedent for the use of mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants in liver diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic inflammation (Takaki et al., 2014; Turkseven et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, Mito‐TEMPO acts primarily as a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic within the mitochondrial matrix. Due to the TPP⁺ moiety that directs its accumulation, Mito‐TEMPO selectively localizes within mitochondria, where it catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide radicals (O₂•⁻) into hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and molecular oxygen (Amorim, 2022). This catalytic activity reduces the local concentration of superoxide, a reactive oxygen species that otherwise can oxidatively inactivate key mitochondrial enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism. In the context of NASH, excessive mitochondrial superoxide production has been implicated in the oxidative inactivation of enzymes such as CPT1 and ACADs. Oxidative modifications, including protein carbonylation, compromise these enzymes, leading to diminished β‐oxidation capacity, intracellular lipid accumulation, and subsequently chronic lipotoxic stress on hepatocytes (Ajith, 2018; Xiang et al., 2021). By scavenging superoxide radicals, Mito‐TEMPO helps to preserve the structural and functional integrity of these enzymes. Moreover, lowering mitochondrial ROS not only prevents the direct oxidative damage of β‐oxidation enzymes but also protects other mitochondrial components such as cardiolipin, an essential phospholipid that maintains the proper organization of electron transport chain complexes (Ajith, 2018). Reduced ROS generation also diminishes the activation of redox‐sensitive intracellular signaling pathways such as the nuclear factor kappa B (NF‐κB) cascade that drive inflammatory gene expression and promote fibrogenesis (Xiang et al., 2021).
Beyond its direct antioxidant role, the reduction in mitochondrial ROS by Mito‐TEMPO may have significant secondary effects. Lower ROS levels reduce the initiation of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), which is associated with cytochrome c release and the subsequent induction of apoptotic cascades. This preservation of mitochondrial membrane integrity is crucial in preventing apoptotic cell death, a process that contributes to the progression of liver injury in NASH (Ajith, 2018; Xiang et al., 2021). In summary, the multifaceted mechanism of Mito‐TEMPO encompasses both an upstream reduction in ROS burden and downstream preservation of mitochondrial function, establishing a molecular basis for its beneficial effects in hepatocytes burdened with oxidative stress.

Expected Effect
The central hypothesis driving the evaluation of Mito‐TEMPO in NASH is that by reducing oxidative inactivation of key β‐oxidation enzymes, the compound will preserve overall mitochondrial function and support sustained fatty acid oxidation. In vitro studies using hepatocyte cultures derived from NASH models have demonstrated that Mito‐TEMPO effectively lowers intracellular ROS levels and restores enzymatic activities of CPT1 and ACADs. As these enzymes are critical for the mitochondrial β‐oxidative degradation of fatty acids, their preservation is expected to improve the energetic and metabolic status of hepatocytes (Ajith, 2018; Xiang et al., 2021). Biochemical assays, such as measurements of protein carbonylation, have confirmed that application of Mito‐TEMPO leads to a decrease in oxidative modifications on β‐oxidation enzymes, which correlates with enhanced enzyme activity and improved rates of fatty acid oxidation (Ajith, 2018).
In preclinical rodent models of diet‐induced NASH, administration of Mito‐TEMPO has been associated with several beneficial outcomes. Notably, there is evidence of a reduction in hepatic steatosis, as demonstrated by lower intracellular lipid accumulation, and a decrease in fibrosis markers, indicating a less fibrogenic hepatic environment (Saito et al., 2023; Maseko, 2024). The expected effects extend to reduced activation of inflammatory pathways, given that oxidative damage is a known trigger for the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α) and interleukin‐6 (Ajith, 2018). In addition, improved mitochondrial respiration, which can be measured by enhanced electron transport chain efficiency and increased ATP production, is anticipated following Mito‐TEMPO treatment. Improved mitochondrial bioenergetics not only facilitate efficient fatty acid oxidation but also support better overall metabolic regulation in the liver, which may translate into improved insulin sensitivity and systemic metabolic homeostasis (Xiang et al., 2021).
On a cellular ultrastructural level, the preservation of mitochondrial integrity is expected to manifest as reduced mitochondrial swelling and enhanced maintenance of cristae structure, which are critical indicators of mitochondrial health. Electron microscopy studies conducted in similar contexts have shown that treatment with mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants often leads to marked improvements in mitochondrial morphology (Maseko, 2024). These effects, in turn, alleviate the downstream pathological consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction such as inflammatory responses, apoptotic cell death, and fibrosis. Overall, the anticipated outcome of Mito‐TEMPO treatment is a significant improvement in hepatocyte function, which should be observable as reduced steatosis, lower levels of fibrosis, and an overall attenuation of the chronic inflammatory environment that perpetuates NASH.

Overall Evaluation
Mito‐TEMPO emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for Non‐alcoholic Steatohepatitis through its potent and selective antioxidant actions in mitochondria. One of its principal strengths is its targeted delivery to the mitochondrial matrix via the TPP⁺ moiety, which ensures that the antioxidant effect is concentrated exactly where excessive ROS production occurs. This precise targeting is of critical importance in NASH, a condition characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction that leads to metabolic impairments and chronic liver inflammation (Amorim, 2022; Ajith, 2018). The preclinical evidence is robust; multiple studies have demonstrated that Mito‐TEMPO treatment results in a decrease in oxidative stress markers, improved activity of β‐oxidation enzymes, and preservation of mitochondrial architecture in both in vitro hepatocyte cultures and in vivo rodent models of NASH (Saito et al., 2023; Maseko, 2024). This mechanistic alignment—targeting the mitochondrial source of ROS in order to preserve the functionality of β‐oxidation enzymes—addresses a central pathogenic mechanism underlying NASH.

Despite these strengths, several challenges remain in the translational development of Mito‐TEMPO for clinical use in NASH. First, while the preclinical data are encouraging, there is currently no direct clinical evidence demonstrating efficacy in human subjects. Translating the antioxidant benefits observed in animal models to clinical outcomes in patients with NASH can be hindered by differences in mitochondrial pharmacokinetics and the complexity of the disease itself (Rehman, 2016; Loureiro, 2022). Secondly, it is important to recognize that a basal level of ROS is necessary for normal cell signaling and homeostasis. Over‐suppression of ROS might impair adaptive stress responses, leading to unforeseen side effects during long‐term treatment. This presents a delicate balance in designing dosing strategies that effectively reduce pathological ROS without fully abrogating cellular redox signaling (Ajith, 2018).
Furthermore, the pathophysiology of NASH is multifactorial in nature, involving not only mitochondrial oxidative stress but also a complex interplay between lipid accumulation, chronic inflammation, and fibrogenesis. Thus, while Mito‐TEMPO’s capacity to restore mitochondrial function and enhance β‐oxidation is highly advantageous, it may need to be integrated into a combination therapy regimen to address the broader spectrum of metabolic and inflammatory dysregulations observed in NASH (Xiang et al., 2021; Takaki et al., 2014). Moreover, additional studies are needed to optimize dosing regimens and assess potential interactions with other drugs that patients with metabolic syndrome might be taking. Polypharmacy remains a common challenge in this patient population, and ensuring that Mito‐TEMPO does not interfere with the pharmacodynamics of standard treatments is critical (Middleton & Vergis, 2021).
On balance, the mechanistic rationale is compelling. Mito‐TEMPO’s capacity to scavenge mitochondrial superoxide offers a direct means to restore the activity of enzymes critical to fatty acid oxidation, thereby reducing hepatocyte steatosis and preventing the propagation of inflammatory and fibrotic signals associated with NASH (Ajith, 2018; Xiang et al., 2021). Its preclinical success in reducing oxidative stress markers and improving mitochondrial function supports the hypothesis that preserving the functionality of mitochondrial β‐oxidation enzymes is a viable therapeutic strategy in NASH (Maseko, 2024; Zheng et al., 2023).

Nevertheless, the absence of direct clinical trials necessitates caution. The translation from animal models to human patients in the realm of mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants has historically been challenging due to differences in mitochondrial dynamics, dosing considerations, and the potential for unintended suppression of necessary ROS‐dependent physiological processes (Rehman, 2016; Seen, 2021). In addition, verifying that the observed improvements in mitochondrial morphology and enzyme activity in preclinical studies correlate with meaningful clinical endpoints, such as improved liver histology and reduced progression to cirrhosis, is an essential step in the validation process (Takaki et al., 2014; Xiang et al., 2021).

In conclusion, Mito‐TEMPO exhibits a highly favorable pharmacodynamic profile for the treatment of Non‐alcoholic Steatohepatitis. Its targeted mechanism—neutralizing mitochondrial superoxide, protecting critical β‐oxidation enzymes, and preserving mitochondrial integrity—addresses a central and well‐established pathogenic process in NASH. The extensive preclinical data, which include reductions in ROS‐induced oxidative damage, improved β‐oxidative flux, and hepatoprotective effects in animal models, strongly support its further investigation as a repurposed drug candidate (Ajith, 2018; Xiang et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2023; Saito et al., 2023). However, the challenges of translating these findings into human clinical benefit must be carefully addressed with rigorous pharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy studies. With optimized dosing strategies and potential combination approaches to account for the multifactorial nature of NASH, Mito‐TEMPO holds promise as a cornerstone in future therapeutic regimens intended to restore mitochondrial function and ameliorate liver disease. Continued preclinical and early‐phase clinical evaluations are therefore warranted to fully define its clinical utility in managing NASH and related metabolic liver disorders.

"Nicotinamide Riboside (NR, ChromaDex Niagen)","Proposal for Nicotinamide Riboside (NR, ChromaDex Niagen)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a naturally occurring derivative of vitamin B3 that functions as an NAD⁺ precursor and was originally identified in cow milk and other dietary sources (Biţă et al., 2023). NR can be synthesized chemically and enzymatically, with recent advances producing more stable forms (e.g., borate-stabilized NR) that improve its shelf-life while ultimately delivering the active compound once ingested (Mehmel et al., 2020; Milisav & Poljsak, 2018). As a member of the NAD⁺ precursor class, NR has historically been used both as a nutraceutical to improve metabolic health and as a research tool to study the roles of NAD⁺ in aging, inflammation, and mitochondrial function (Biţă et al., 2023; Mehmel et al., 2020). Its classification in this group places it alongside other vitamin B3 compounds such as nicotinic acid (NA) and nicotinamide (NAM), but NR has gained particular attention because it elevates NAD⁺ levels without the dose-limiting side effects (e.g., flushing) associated with NA, establishing it as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for metabolic diseases (Trammell et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Over the past decade, NR supplementation has been the focus of extensive biochemical, preclinical, and early-phase clinical studies, particularly in the context of aging, metabolic syndrome, and mitochondrial dysfunction (Conze et al., 2019; Mehmel et al., 2020). In animal models, NR has been shown to increase NAD⁺ levels in various tissues, leading to improvements in mitochondrial function, enhanced β-oxidation, and beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and inflammation, which are critical parameters in metabolic disease states (Braidy et al., 2019; Mehmel et al., 2020). More recently, early-phase clinical trials in subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have demonstrated that NR supplementation—often administered in combination with other metabolic cofactors such as L-carnitine and N-acetylcysteine—can decrease liver fat content and modulate systemic metabolic biomarkers with an excellent safety and tolerability profile (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019; Dollerup et al., 2018). Although direct clinical trials in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remain limited, the preclinical evidence in rodent models of NAFLD and early human studies indicate promising translational potential for NR in the treatment of NASH, a more advanced form of fatty liver disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, NR functions primarily by serving as a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺), a coenzyme that is essential for redox reactions and for the activity of a number of NAD⁺-dependent enzymes (Mehmel et al., 2020; Trammell et al., 2016). Once administered, NR is phosphorylated by nicotinamide riboside kinases (NRK1 and NRK2) into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which is then converted into NAD⁺ via NMN adenylyltransferases. The resultant elevation in intracellular NAD⁺ levels activates sirtuins, particularly SIRT1 and SIRT3, which are responsible for the deacetylation of key metabolic regulators such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) (Biţă et al., 2023; Braidy et al., 2019). SIRT1 activation promotes fatty acid β-oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis through deacetylation of PGC-1α, while SIRT3 activation enhances mitochondrial enzyme activity leading to improved oxidative phosphorylation and a reduction in oxidative stress (Biţă et al., 2023; Mehmel et al., 2020). Furthermore, the increase in NAD⁺ also supports other antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, thereby reducing hepatic inflammation—a central component in the pathogenesis of NASH (Braidy et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2022). These molecular interactions collectively enhance mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, leading to decreased lipid accumulation and amelioration of metabolic stress in hepatocytes (Biţă et al., 2023; Mehmel et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the context of NASH, it is hypothesized that NR supplementation will elevate hepatic NAD⁺ pools sufficiently to activate SIRT1 and SIRT3 pathways, thereby enhancing mitochondrial function and β-oxidation capacity in hepatocytes (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Dollerup et al., 2018). The expected effect is that increased NAD⁺ levels will promote the deacetylation of PGC-1α via SIRT1, leading to the transcriptional upregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Simultaneously, SIRT3 will deacetylate and activate mitochondrial enzymes directly involved in oxidative phosphorylation, thereby enhancing energy production and reducing the accumulation of lipid intermediates (Mehmel et al., 2020; Braidy et al., 2019). These biochemical events should reduce hepatic steatosis, lower circulating inflammatory markers, and attenuate fibrosis by directly affecting the activation state of hepatic stellate cells, which are key drivers of fibrogenesis in NASH (Pham et al., 2019; Dollerup et al., 2018). Based on preclinical data, NR is also expected to increase whole-body energy expenditure, which can contribute to weight loss and improved lipid profiles—factors that would be beneficial in mitigating NASH progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019; Pham et al., 2019). Given that sirtuin expression is documented in hepatocytes and that mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of NASH pathology, the proposed mechanism aligns well with the therapeutic needs of patients with advanced metabolic liver disease (Biţă et al., 2023; Mehmel et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
NR presents a compelling therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NASH based on its well-established mechanism of elevating NAD⁺ levels, activating SIRT1/SIRT3, and enhancing mitochondrial function and β-oxidation in metabolically active tissues (Biţă et al., 2023; Mehmel et al., 2020). One of the main strengths of NR is its robust safety profile, as confirmed by multiple clinical studies that demonstrate good tolerability even at relatively high doses, and its longstanding use as a dietary supplement supports its rapid translation into clinical settings (Airhart et al., 2017; Conze et al., 2019). Furthermore, preclinical studies consistently show that NR can reduce hepatic steatosis and fibrosis markers in models of diet-induced liver disease, which is highly encouraging for NASH indications (Pham et al., 2019; Dollerup et al., 2018).

However, several weaknesses must also be considered. Although the mechanistic rationale is strong, human clinical efficacy data in NASH patients remain limited, and some trials in related metabolic conditions (e.g., NAFLD) have shown improvements in metabolic biomarkers rather than clear-cut clinical benefits (Dollerup et al., 2018; Damgaard & Treebak, 2023). Additionally, the tissue-specific distribution of NAD⁺ after oral NR administration may present challenges, as certain tissues such as skeletal muscle might not experience the same degree of NAD⁺ elevation as others, and the liver-specific pharmacodynamics require further elucidation in the NASH context (Damgaard & Treebak, 2023; Mehmel et al., 2020). It is also important to note that while NR has been shown to favorably modulate inflammation and oxidative stress in preclinical models, the translation of these effects into sustained clinical improvements in liver histology and function in NASH patients has yet to be definitively demonstrated (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024).

In summary, NR has a strong mechanistic basis and an established safety profile that support its candidacy for repurposing as a therapeutic agent in NASH. Its ability to elevate NAD⁺ levels, activate key metabolic regulators like SIRT1 and SIRT3, improve mitochondrial function, and reduce inflammatory and fibrotic markers aligns well with the pathophysiology of NASH. The preclinical evidence, coupled with early-phase clinical data in related metabolic liver diseases, is promising. However, the overall efficacy in NASH specifically remains to be conclusively proven in larger, well-powered clinical trials that focus directly on liver outcomes. Given its strengths and the potential to accelerate clinical translation due to its established safety, NR is a promising candidate, though further targeted studies are necessary to fully validate its therapeutic impact in patients with NASH (Biţă et al., 2023; Dollerup et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024).

"Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN, Cayman Chemical #B119460)","Proposal for Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN, Cayman Chemical #B119460)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) is an endogenous nucleotide naturally present in various tissues that serves as a direct precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). It is typically derived from the vitamin B3 family, which includes niacin and nicotinamide, and functions by entering the NAD+ salvage pathway. NMN can be both isolated from natural sources and produced synthetically; in this candidate’s case it is provided as Cayman Chemical #B119460. NMN belongs to the class of NAD+ precursors, a group of compounds that have historically been used as nutritional supplements and therapeutic agents in anti-aging research. This class of compounds is known to boost intracellular NAD+ levels, thereby enhancing cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function. Numerous preclinical studies have established that NAD+ precursors like NMN not only have potential roles in ameliorating age-associated metabolic decline but also show promise in correcting metabolic disorders including diabetes and fatty liver conditions (Alegre & Pastore, 2023; Okabe et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, NAD+ precursors have been studied extensively for their capacity to restore declining NAD+ levels observed in aging and metabolic disorders. NMN, along with compounds like nicotinamide riboside (NR), has drawn increasing attention due to its ability to rapidly restore NAD+ levels in tissues, which then stimulates the activity of NAD+-dependent enzymes such as sirtuins. Early preclinical studies in rodent models have documented that NMN administration increased NAD+ content in multiple tissues, leading to improved mitochondrial respiratory capacity, enhanced β-oxidation, and reduced lipid accumulation in the liver. For instance, NMN has demonstrated efficacy in high-fat diet–fed mice by reversing declines in NAD+ levels and improving multiple metabolic parameters, including insulin sensitivity and hepatic lipid metabolism (Lu et al., 2024; Niño-Narvión et al., 2025). Although the direct application of NMN in Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) has not been as comprehensively evaluated clinically as in other disease models, emerging clinical trials and initial human studies have begun to assess NMN’s pharmacodynamics, tolerance, and effects on metabolic biomarkers—with encouraging safety and bioavailability profiles reported (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). Moreover, several clinical trial programs focused on NAD+ precursors, including those investigating NR and NMN in metabolic and cardiovascular dysfunction, bolster confidence in the translational potential of NMN for NASH, given the metabolic parallels between steatohepatitis and the metabolic syndromes previously investigated (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, NMN operates by entering the NAD+ salvage pathway where it serves as a substrate for NMN adenylyltransferases (Nmnat enzymes), which convert it into NAD+. NAD+ is a pivotal cofactor in redox reactions, required for essential metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and β-oxidation. Importantly, NAD+ is also a substrate for sirtuins (notably SIRT1 and SIRT3) whose activities are crucial for regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, energy metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress responses. SIRT1, for example, is known to regulate key transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), thereby driving mitochondrial biogenesis, improving fatty acid oxidation, and reducing lipid accumulation within hepatocytes (Okabe et al., 2019; Lee & Yang, 2019). Additionally, SIRT3, a mitochondrial sirtuin, is activated upon enhanced NAD+ availability provided by NMN supplementation and plays a crucial role in deacetylating and regulating mitochondrial enzymes, thus ensuring proper mitochondrial respiratory function and minimizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The increase in NAD+ levels further instigates enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which leads to improved oxygen consumption and energy production—a fundamental aspect in mitigating the metabolic disturbances seen in hepatic steatosis and NASH (Okabe et al., 2019; Lee & Yang, 2019). Moreover, preclinical evidence suggests that NMN can stimulate the NAD+-dependent activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a critical energy sensor, which in turn promotes catabolic pathways including fatty acid oxidation while inhibiting anabolic pathways such as de novo lipogenesis through the suppression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) (Wang et al., 2017).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for NMN’s utility in NASH is that by replenishing NAD+ levels in hepatocytes, NMN will drive the activation of SIRT1 and SIRT3, leading to enhanced mitochondrial β-oxidation and biogenesis, a reduction in oxidative stress, and an improvement in overall cellular metabolism. In the specific assays proposed, one would expect to see a measurable increase in cellular NAD+ content following NMN administration. This elevation in NAD+ should correlate with increased activity of SIRT1 and SIRT3, as evidenced by enhanced deacetylation of their molecular targets (e.g., PGC-1α) and upregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation such as CPT-1 and ACOX1 (Lu et al., 2024; Niño-Narvión et al., 2025). Functional assays like oxygen consumption measurements (e.g., using Seahorse analysis) are expected to demonstrate improved mitochondrial respiratory capacity, aligning with findings from rodent studies where NMN supplementation improved oxygen consumption and enhanced energy expenditure (Okabe et al., 2019). Furthermore, the anticipated downstream effects include a reduction in lipid accumulation within liver tissues, improvement in insulin sensitivity, and decreased oxidative stress markers. These effects are strongly supported by biochemical evidence from high-fat diet models where NMN administration led to improved mitochondrial function, upregulated expression of β-oxidation genes, and reduced hepatic steatosis (Poddar et al., 2019; Niño-Narvión et al., 2025). In hepatocytes from NASH models, increased SIRT1 activity is particularly critical since SIRT1 has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects and to promote fatty acid oxidation while suppressing lipogenesis; its expression is well-documented in liver cells, and its modulation by NAD+ levels is a central tenet of NMN’s proposed mechanism of action (Johnson & Imai, 2018; Lee & Yang, 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, NMN stands out as a promising therapeutic candidate for Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) due to its well-established role in replenishing NAD+ levels, which is a critical element in maintaining mitochondrial health, driving sirtuin activation, and regulating metabolic pathways that are adversely affected in NASH. One of the most significant strengths of NMN is its mechanistic specificity: by directly serving as a precursor in the NAD+ salvage pathway, it leads to enhanced activity of SIRT1 and SIRT3 which are central to mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and the reduction of oxidative stress—all key pathological features of NASH (Alegre & Pastore, 2023; Okabe et al., 2019). Preclinical studies in rodent models have consistently demonstrated that NMN supplementation leads to improved liver function, reduced hepatic steatosis, and enhanced metabolic performance, with robust evidence showing increased oxygen consumption and upregulation of β-oxidation genes in high-fat diet–fed mice (Lu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2017).

Additionally, safety and pharmacokinetic studies in mammals indicate good oral bioavailability and tolerability, with no significant toxicity observed at effective doses, which is a considerable advantage for further clinical development (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021; Okabe et al., 2022). The translational potential is further supported by the emerging clinical data demonstrating NMN’s capacity to raise NAD+ levels in human subjects without adverse effects, making it a clinically feasible intervention for metabolic liver disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). However, some weaknesses remain. Direct clinical evidence in NASH patients is still limited, and while preclinical data are promising, further rigorous clinical trials focusing specifically on NASH endpoints are essential. There is also the challenge of ensuring tissue-specific delivery and consistent bioavailability to the liver, as well as determining the optimal dosing regimen to achieve sustained NAD+ restoration without stimulating any off-target effects.

Overall, the accumulated evidence from numerous preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials presents NMN as a mechanistically sound, safe, and effective agent for restoring NAD+ levels, driving sirtuin activation, and enhancing mitochondrial function in hepatocytes. These changes are expected to mitigate steatosis and oxidative stress—the hallmark features of NASH. Given the convincing data from rodent models and the encouraging safety profile in human studies, advancing NMN into NASH-specific clinical trials is justified. The strengths of NMN lie in its targeted mechanism of action and its ability to act on specific metabolic processes that are dysregulated in NASH, while its weaknesses primarily relate to the need for further direct clinical evidence. On balance, NMN has considerable potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for NASH and warrants continued development and evaluation in this disease context (Alegre & Pastore, 2023; Niño-Narvión et al., 2025; Okabe et al., 2019).

"Urolithin A (MITOPURE, Amazentis)

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of Urolithin A (MITOPURE, Amazentis) for the treatment of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH):","Proposal for Urolithin A (MITOPURE, Amazentis)

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of Urolithin A (MITOPURE, Amazentis) for the treatment of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH):

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Urolithin A (UA) is a bioactive metabolite produced by the gut microbiota through the bioconversion of dietary ellagitannins and ellagic acid found in pomegranates, berries, and walnuts. It exists as a naturally occurring postbiotic and is marketed by Amazentis under the trade name MITOPURE. UA belongs to a class of therapeutic compounds known as urolithins, which are microbial metabolites that have emerged as modulators of mitochondrial quality control processes. The discovery of UA originated from studies focused on how gut microbiota process polyphenols into bioavailable metabolites that can exert systemic effects related to mitochondrial function. UA falls within the broader category of nutraceuticals with potential pharmacological benefits; historically, compounds derived from ellagitannins have been investigated for their antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties, but only recently has the explicit role of UA in enhancing mitochondrial function been recognized (Faitg et al., 2024). In addition, UA is of interest because it has been shown to induce mitophagy, a quality control mechanism that ensures the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria, and also appears to promote mitochondrial biogenesis via activation of pathways such as SIRT1-PGC-1α (Faitg et al., 2024). This dual mechanism makes UA a promising candidate for restoring hepatic energy metabolism and reducing pathological lipid accumulation in NASH, a condition characterized by excessive hepatic fat deposition, inflammation, and fibrosis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, urolithins, including UA, have been evaluated primarily for their effects on muscle aging, neurodegeneration, and metabolic diseases. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that UA extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans and improves muscle function in rodent models by enhancing mitochondrial respiration and increasing energy production (Ryu et al., 2016). In randomized clinical trials, specifically in elderly populations, UA supplementation has been shown to be safe, demonstrating favorable bioavailability and improvements in mitochondrial gene expression – hallmark indicators of improved mitochondrial quality (Faitg et al., 2024; Toney et al., 2021). Moreover, studies in obese mouse models have noted that UA administration leads to a reduction in hepatic triglyceride accumulation and systemic inflammation – findings that are directly relevant to the therapeutic milieu seen in NASH (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Raimundo et al., 2021). While UA has not been extensively used in the clinic for NASH specifically, the preclinical history in related metabolic diseases and liver injury models – including acetaminophen-induced liver injury – provide a strong basis for its repurposing in NASH (Gao et al., 2022). This evidence, combined with emerging data from mechanistic studies demonstrating UA’s ability to induce mitophagy via the Parkin/PINK1 axis, has spurred further interest in investigating UA as a novel agent targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in NASH (Jayatunga et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
Urolithin A’s primary mechanism revolves around the induction of mitophagy, which is the selective degradation of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria. At the molecular level, this process is orchestrated by the PINK1/Parkin pathway; when mitochondria become depolarized or sustain damage, the kinase PINK1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it recruits and activates the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin. Activated Parkin ubiquitinates various mitochondrial proteins, thereby marking the mitochondrion for autophagic degradation via the autophagosome and subsequent fusion with lysosomes (Faitg et al., 2024; Ryu et al., 2016). In multiple experimental models – from C. elegans to rodents – UA has been shown to increase the expression and phosphorylation of Parkin (especially at Ser65) and to augment LC3 recruitment onto mitochondria, which are key indicators of active mitophagic flux (Faitg et al., 2024; Makarov & Korkotian, 2023). Additionally, UA has been observed to engage the SIRT1-PGC-1α axis, a known regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. By upregulating SIRT1, UA indirectly enhances the transcriptional activity of PGC-1α, leading to increased synthesis of mitochondrial proteins and replication of mitochondrial DNA – essential for replacing the pool of cleared damaged mitochondria (Faitg et al., 2024; Toney et al., 2021). Complementary evidence from cellular studies further indicates that UA activates AMPK, a cellular energy sensor that not only initiates autophagic processes via ULK1 but also inhibits mTOR, thereby indirectly facilitating mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis (Toney et al., 2021; Makarov & Korkotian, 2023). Although several studies have concentrated on the effect of UA in skeletal muscle, the mechanistic pathways involved have significant parallels in hepatocytes, where mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired β-oxidation contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH. In hepatocytes, the activation of mitophagy would clear dysfunctional mitochondria, reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species, and enhance the cellular capacity for fatty acid β-oxidation, thereby lowering intracellular lipid burden (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Raimundo et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
Based on preclinical studies and preliminary human data, the expectation is that UA will exert a multi-faceted beneficial effect on NASH hepatocytes. In the proposed NASH model, UA is hypothesized to induce robust mitophagy via activation of the PINK1/Parkin pathway, which will lead to efficient clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria that are known to accumulate in NASH due to metabolic stress and lipid overload (Jayatunga et al., 2021; Senavirathna et al., 2024). As dysfunctional mitochondria contribute to decreased fatty acid β-oxidation and impaired energy homeostasis, their removal would restore metabolic equilibrium and improve the oxidative capacity of hepatocytes. This restoration is anticipated to be complemented by stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis via the upregulation of SIRT1-PGC-1α signaling – a pathway that has been shown to be activated by UA in previous studies and is critical in regenerating the healthy mitochondrial pool (Faitg et al., 2024; Toney et al., 2021). Consequently, the expected cellular effect is an increase in mitochondrial respiration, enhanced clearance of toxic lipid metabolites, and reduced oxidative stress, ultimately leading to diminished hepatic inflammation and fibrosis – key endpoints in the progression of NASH (Raimundo et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2022). In hepatocytes, the gene products of both Parkin and PINK1 are expressed and are crucial in governing the mitophagy process; thus, their upregulation in response to UA treatment is a plausible and desirable outcome in this assay (Makarov & Korkotian, 2023). The cumulative effect of these processes would be an enhanced ability of hepatocytes to oxidize fatty acids, reduce triglyceride accumulation, and alleviate the inflammation-fibrosis cascade that drives NASH progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Senavirathna et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Our overall assessment of Urolithin A as a repurposed drug candidate for NASH is highly encouraging, with several strengths that support its further investigation. First, the natural origin of UA from dietary ellagitannins, along with its proven safety profile in clinical phase I trials, provides a strong translational benefit with minimal toxicity concerns (Toney et al., 2021; Ryu et al., 2016). Second, the mechanistic rationale underpinning UA’s mode of action is robust; extensive preclinical data demonstrate that UA induces mitophagy via the PINK1/Parkin pathway and stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis via SIRT1-PGC-1α and AMPK activation – processes that are directly deficient in NASH hepatocytes (Faitg et al., 2024; Toney et al., 2021). This mitophagy-centric approach is expected to address a fundamental pathogenic mechanism in NASH, namely the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria that deranges fatty acid oxidation and promotes oxidative stress (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Raimundo et al., 2021). Third, UA has demonstrated efficacy in reducing hepatic triglyceride levels and systemic inflammation in obese mouse models, suggesting that its benefits extend beyond skeletal muscle and into hepatic tissue, which is the primary target in NASH (Gao et al., 2022; Senavirathna et al., 2024). Fourth, the fact that UA can be administered orally, exhibits dose-linear pharmacokinetics, and shows clear target engagement in human trials is particularly valuable for a chronic condition like NASH that requires long-term management (Toney et al., 2021; Faitg et al., 2024).

Despite these strengths, several potential weaknesses and knowledge gaps remain that must be addressed. Although mechanistic studies strongly support the role of UA in inducing mitophagy and stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis, most of these studies have been conducted in the context of muscle aging or acute liver injury models, such as acetaminophen-induced injury, rather than chronic models of NASH (Gao et al., 2022; Senavirathna et al., 2024). Direct evidence from in vitro studies using NASH-relevant hepatic cell lines or in vivo non-alcoholic steatohepatitis animal models specifically demonstrating a reduction in hepatic lipid burden is still limited. Furthermore, while the clinical safety profile is promising, detailed efficacy data in a NASH patient population, including histological endpoints such as fibrosis regression and improvement in steatosis scores, have yet to be fully reported (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Raimundo et al., 2021). There is also a need to further dissect whether UA’s benefits in the liver are solely due to mitophagy induction or whether additional mechanisms—such as modulation of inflammatory signaling pathways (e.g., Nrf2 activation)—play a synergistic role (Gao et al., 2022; Toney et al., 2021). Finally, interindividual variations in gut microbial metabotypes that affect endogenous UA production underscore the importance of ensuring consistent bioavailability in the target population, making the standardized formulation (MITOPURE) a critical asset in clinical translation (Toney et al., 2021; Senavirathna et al., 2024).

In conclusion, Urolithin A demonstrates significant promise as a therapeutic candidate for NASH via its ability to induce mitophagy, clear dysfunctional mitochondria, and stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis in hepatocytes. These mechanistic effects are expected to enhance fatty acid β-oxidation, reduce hepatic lipid accumulation, and mitigate inflammation—a multi-pronged approach that addresses fundamental aspects of NASH pathophysiology (Jayatunga et al., 2021; Toney et al., 2021). The preclinical data, combined with favorable human safety profiles and early signs of metabolic benefits, provide a compelling rationale for advancing UA into further efficacy studies in NASH models and clinical trials. However, additional focused studies specifically interrogating UA’s impact on liver histopathology, mitochondrial biogenesis in hepatocytes, and long-term clinical outcomes in NASH patients will be necessary to validate its use in this indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Raimundo et al., 2021). Overall, the strengths of UA—including its dual action on both mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis, its natural origin with excellent safety margins, and its potential to correct key metabolic defects in NASH—outweigh the current limitations, making it a highly promising candidate for further development in the NASH therapeutic arena.

Seladelpar (Medivir),"Proposal for Seladelpar (Medivir)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Seladelpar is a synthetic small‐molecule drug candidate designed to selectively activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily known to regulate genes involved in lipid metabolism, fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and inflammation. Originally discovered and optimized through focused medicinal chemistry programs, seladelpar belongs to the class of selective PPARδ agonists that have been explored for their potential to address metabolic dysfunction‐associated diseases. As a small-molecule ligand, it has a high degree of receptor selectivity, with an EC50 in the low nanomolar range (∼20 nM), ensuring that its downstream effects predominantly arise from PPARδ activation rather than engagement of PPARα or PPARγ. The structural studies indicate that seladelpar interacts with specific regions of the PPARδ ligand binding domain (LBD), such as the “Center” and “Arm II” regions, thereby stabilizing key amino acid residues that are essential for receptor activation (Kamata et al., 2023b). This specificity is critical not only for enhancing the desired transcriptional cascade—such as the upregulation of FAO genes—but also for minimizing off-target effects that have historically limited the utility of pan-PPAR agonists in clinical settings (Kamata et al., 2023a). Compounds in this therapeutic class have previously been used in dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome settings; indeed, modulation of PPARδ activity has long been recognized for its ability to promote increased mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids and improve overall energy homeostasis, which is a property that has been validated in both preclinical and early-phase clinical studies (Ochoa et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Seladelpar has undergone clinical evaluation in settings beyond its current focus on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Its therapeutic history includes investigations in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), where it was assessed in multiple phase 2 trials to determine effects on biochemical markers—primarily alkaline phosphatase (ALP)—and other liver enzymes. For instance, clinical trial NCT03551522 evaluated seladelpar in a double-blind, placebo-controlled setting in subjects with NASH (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018), while additional studies (such as NCT02955602 (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016) and recent trials in PBC contexts) have aimed at demonstrating its safety, tolerability, and efficacy in modulating liver biochemistry (Gellrich & Merk, 2017). Beyond clinical studies, preclinical rodent models of NASH have provided evidence that treatment with seladelpar leads to a decrease in hepatic triglyceride levels and attenuates fibrosis markers, suggesting a beneficial effect on the liver’s metabolic status. Notably, genetic deletion models of PPARδ have shown worsening of steatosis, which reinforces the rationale for its activation as a therapeutic strategy (Kamata et al., 2023a). Although seladelpar’s clinical program for NASH experienced setbacks—such as the early termination of a phase 2 study due to unexpected histological findings—it remains a promising candidate because its mechanism and preclinical profile support its potential utility in treating metabolic liver conditions that share pathophysiological features with NASH (Ochoa et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
Seladelpar’s mechanism of action centers on its selective activation of PPARδ, a nuclear receptor that heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) upon ligand binding, subsequently binding to PPAR response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. Activation results in transcriptional upregulation of genes critical for fatty acid oxidation, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 (ECH1), thereby boosting mitochondrial β-oxidation and reducing intracellular lipid accumulation (Kamata et al., 2023b; Wei et al., 2023). At the molecular level, structural studies reveal that seladelpar binds within the large ligand-binding pocket of PPARδ, engaging hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions; such binding is thought to stabilize the receptor’s activation function-2 (AF-2) surface, which is crucial for coactivator recruitment and transcriptional activation (Kamata et al., 2023b). This focused activation mediates several downstream effects: enhancement of mitochondrial oxidative capacity, reduction in the synthesis of intracellular triglycerides, and modulation of inflammatory signaling pathways. In addition, the activation of PPARδ has been associated with suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which is pertinent in the context of NASH where chronic inflammation drives progression from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis and subsequent fibrosis (Gellrich & Merk, 2017). The selectivity of seladelpar for PPARδ means that its pharmacological effects are distinct from those of pan-PPAR or dual-PPAR agonists; this is significant because prior agents targeting PPARγ have sometimes exhibited undesirable side effects, such as weight gain, edema, or fluid retention, thereby limiting their clinical utility (Kamata et al., 2023a; Lange et al., 2022). Through these well-characterized molecular interactions and the subsequent induction of genes that promote fatty acid oxidation, seladelpar is anticipated to improve hepatic lipid handling and mitigate inflammatory processes that otherwise contribute to liver injury in metabolic disorders such as NASH (Gellrich & Merk, 2017; Kamata et al., 2023b).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the hypothesis is that seladelpar will drive hepatocyte expression of key fatty acid oxidation enzymes (for example, CPT1A and ECH1) and thereby boost mitochondrial oxidative capacity. In experimental assays using primary human hepatocytes, activation of PPARδ by seladelpar has led to an upregulation of FAO genes and an increase in mitochondrial function, which in turn is expected to reduce intracellular lipid accumulation—a hallmark of NASH pathology (Wei et al., 2023; Ochoa et al., 2023). Moreover, enhanced fatty acid oxidation is anticipated to lower the levels of lipotoxic intermediates that promote inflammatory cytokine production. Preclinical rodent models of NASH treated with seladelpar have shown improvements in hepatic histology, including decreased triglyceride content, reduced steatosis, and lower expression of fibrosis markers (Gellrich & Merk, 2017; Kamata et al., 2023a). In addition, in metabolic syndrome patients, preliminary human studies have demonstrated improvements in lipid profiles without significant adverse events, lending credence to the therapeutic potential of seladelpar in modulating metabolic parameters that are often deranged in NASH (Ochoa et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The expectation is that by selectively boosting FAO and reducing pro-inflammatory signaling, seladelpar will alleviate hepatocyte lipotoxicity and forestall the progression of liver inflammation and fibrosis. Importantly, because PPARδ is expressed in hepatocytes as well as in other tissues influencing systemic metabolism, the benefits of increased fatty acid oxidation could extend beyond the liver to improve overall insulin sensitivity and metabolic homeostasis, which are crucial for patients suffering from NASH and the associated metabolic syndrome (Lange et al., 2022; Gellrich & Merk, 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, seladelpar presents compelling strengths as a therapeutic candidate for NASH based on its highly selective activation of PPARδ and its well-understood molecular mechanism, which collectively promise to enhance mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, reduce hepatic lipid accumulation, and attenuate inflammatory responses (Kamata et al., 2023b; Gellrich & Merk, 2017). Its high receptor selectivity minimizes the potential for off-target effects commonly seen with pan-PPAR agonists, and preclinical models have convincingly demonstrated reductions in hepatic triglycerides, steatosis, and fibrosis markers upon treatment with seladelpar (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; Kamata et al., 2023a). Additionally, preliminary clinical data in metabolic syndrome and PBC patients have shown beneficial lipid-modulating effects and an acceptable safety profile, even though the therapeutic program for NASH has encountered challenges such as unexpected histological findings that led to trial termination in one instance (Wei et al., 2023; Ochoa et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

On the strength side, the mechanistic rationale is robust: PPARδ activation is consistently linked to increased expression of fatty acid oxidation enzymes such as CPT1A and ECH1 in hepatocytes, which is critical for reducing lipid buildup in the liver (Wei et al., 2023). This biochemical effect translates into improved mitochondrial oxidative capacity and reduced levels of lipotoxic intermediates that would otherwise exacerbate inflammatory cytokine production. Such changes are vital for halting the progression of NASH from simple steatosis to active steatohepatitis and eventual fibrosis. The improved metabolic and lipid profiles observed in early-phase clinical investigations further support the candidate’s potential (Ochoa et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, there are notable weaknesses and challenges. The clinical development of seladelpar for NASH has been marred by interruptions due to unexpected liver histological findings, such as interface hepatitis, despite biochemical stabilization. Such findings raise concerns regarding the long-term safety of the agent in a vulnerable population with hepatic dysfunction (Kamata et al., 2023a; Lange et al., 2022). Although extensive independent reviews and the eventual lifting of clinical holds by regulatory authorities suggest that these histological findings may not reflect direct hepatotoxicity from seladelpar, the uncertainty surrounding its safety profile in NASH patients persists. Additionally, although preclinical models support its efficacy, translational gaps between rodent models and human NASH pathology remain a significant hurdle in drug development for this indication. The complexity of NASH—encompassing metabolic derangements, inflammation, and fibrosis—requires that any candidate not only improve biochemical markers but also result in meaningful histological and clinical improvements over the long term (Gellrich & Merk, 2017; Kamata et al., 2023a).

Furthermore, while the pharmacological selectivity of seladelpar is considered a strength, the narrow focus on PPARδ may limit its efficacy if the pathogenesis of NASH in a given patient involves significant contributions from pathways modulated by PPARα or PPARγ. Dual or pan-PPAR agonists—such as elafibranor and lanifibranor—have shown promise by simultaneously addressing multiple metabolic axes, and the failure of some PPARδ-specific approaches in clinical studies hints that combination approaches or broader receptor engagement might yield more consistent clinical outcomes (Gellrich & Merk, 2017; Lange et al., 2022). Moreover, while improvements in circulating lipid profiles and inflammatory markers have been reported, robust evidence demonstrating long-term histological improvement in liver tissue, a critical endpoint in NASH therapy, remains to be fully established.

In conclusion, seladelpar is a promising therapeutic candidate for NASH based on its strong mechanistic rationale, high selectivity, and ability to induce fatty acid oxidation and mitigate inflammation. Preclinical studies in rodent models and early-phase clinical data in metabolic disorders support the candidate’s expected benefits in reducing hepatic lipid accumulation and improving systemic metabolic parameters. However, unresolved safety concerns stemming from unexpected histological findings in NASH trials, together with the inherent complexities of translating preclinical efficacy into clinical success, represent significant challenges that must be addressed. As an expert drug development team, further detailed investigation—including rigorous mechanistic studies in human hepatocytes, expanded clinical trials with focused safety and efficacy endpoints, and comparisons with broader PPAR agonist modalities—would be recommended. This approach should elucidate whether the benefits of selective PPARδ activation by seladelpar can be harnessed safely and effectively to reverse steatosis, decrease inflammation, and ultimately improve liver histology in NASH patients (Kamata et al., 2023a; Gellrich & Merk, 2017; Lange et al., 2022).

"SR9009 (Cayman Chemical, Cat. #10013104)","Proposal for SR9009 (Cayman Chemical, Cat. #10013104)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SR9009 is a synthetic small‐molecule agonist originally designed to target the nuclear receptor REV-ERBα, an atypical ligand-regulated transcriptional repressor involved in circadian rhythm regulation and metabolic homeostasis. Chemically synthesized using modern medicinal chemistry and structure–activity relationship (SAR) approaches, SR9009 belongs to the class of REV-ERB agonists that have been extensively employed as chemical probes to study circadian biology, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory processes. Its design was intended to overcome the limitations of earlier REV-ERB modulators, such as GSK4112, by providing improved pharmacokinetic properties and potency in in vivo settings. The chemical structure of SR9009 allows it to bind within the ligand-binding domain of REV-ERBα, thereby inducing a conformational change that promotes the recruitment of nuclear receptor co-repressor complexes such as NCoR and HDAC3. This interaction results in transcriptional repression of target genes that are central to lipogenesis, inflammatory signaling, and circadian regulation. Historically, REV-ERB agonists like SR9009 have been used primarily as research tools to investigate the complex interplay between the circadian clock and metabolic gene regulation. In many rodent studies, these compounds have been shown to modulate energy homeostasis, reduce adiposity, and influence lipid profiles. The synthetic origins of SR9009, along with its established role as a tool compound in preclinical metabolic studies, underscore its potential for repurposing in diseases such as Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), where disruption of lipid metabolism and circadian rhythms are major pathological features (Griffett et al., 2020; Griffett et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of REV-ERB agonists centers on their use in experimental models of metabolic disease, obesity, and inflammation. Several preclinical studies have established that SR9009 can positively modulate metabolic profiles in rodent models. For instance, SR9009 treatment in models of diet-induced obesity has been associated with a reduction in body fat, decreased plasma triglycerides and cholesterol, and improvements in glucose tolerance. In mouse models of Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), SR9009 has demonstrated efficacy by reducing hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, as well as by ameliorating some of the underlying metabolic disturbances that drive disease progression (Griffett et al., 2020). Although direct human clinical studies are lacking—as evidenced by the absence of registered clinical trials for SR9009 in NASH (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—the robust preclinical data in rodent models provide a solid foundation for its further evaluation in liver disease contexts similar to NASH. In addition to metabolic improvements, preclinical studies have reported that REV-ERB agonists can suppress inflammatory gene expression and fibrogenic markers, which are crucial in halting the progression of NAFLD to NASH (Griffett et al., 2020; Raza et al., 2022). Previous investigations have also shown that REV-ERB activation can improve liver pathology via mechanisms that include the downregulation of fibrotic genes like TGFβ1 and Mmp13, as well as the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β. Collectively, the therapeutic history of SR9009 and related compounds in preclinical models underscores their potential as repurposed agents for NASH, especially given the multifaceted approach required to address metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrotic aspects of the disease (Griffett et al., 2020; Welch et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, SR9009 functions as an agonist of REV-ERBα, a nuclear receptor encoded by NR1D1 that plays a central role in regulating circadian rhythms, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory responses. REV-ERBα lacks a traditional activation function domain and acts predominantly as a transcriptional repressor. Upon binding to SR9009, REV-ERBα undergoes a conformational change that facilitates the recruitment of nuclear co-repressors such as NCoR and HDAC3, resulting in the suppression of target gene transcription (Griffett et al., 2022; Hong et al., 2021). This transcriptional repression affects a wide array of genes involved in lipogenesis and inflammatory signaling. For example, REV-ERB activation leads to the downregulation of genes such as Dhcr24, ApoE, and ApoC3, which play roles in cholesterol and lipid metabolism (Griffett et al., 2020). Additionally, REV-ERBα’s action on circadian regulators, such as Bmal1—whose expression is directly repressed by REV-ERBα—results in the synchronization of metabolic processes with circadian phases, thereby promoting a state of enhanced metabolic efficiency (Griffett et al., 2022; Hong et al., 2021).

The compound’s proposed mechanism in the context of NASH is particularly centered on its ability to enhance the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway. The hypothesis is that by activating REV-ERBα, SR9009 will upregulate key enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, such as Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and Medium-chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase (MCAD), thereby enhancing mitochondrial function and reducing hepatic steatosis. Although direct experimental evidence in hepatocyte models regarding the upregulation of CPT1A and MCAD upon treatment with SR9009 remains to be comprehensively documented in the excerpts provided, the mechanistic rationale is supported by broader studies indicating that REV-ERB agonism is associated with enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and increased oxidative metabolism (Crouchet et al., 2025; Welch et al., 2022). Moreover, animal studies have demonstrated that pharmacological activation of REV-ERB can improve systemic metabolic parameters, reduce inflammatory cytokine levels, and improve liver histology by reducing fibrosis, all of which are consistent with the anticipated downstream effects of enhancing β-oxidation and mitochondrial function (Griffett et al., 2020; Raza et al., 2022). The direct promoter occupancy of REV-ERBα on target genes in hepatocytes also further supports the notion that SR9009 modulates gene expression at the transcriptional level, contributing to its overall beneficial effects observed in rodent models of NASH (Griffett et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
The expected therapeutic effect of SR9009 in the context of NASH is multifaceted. In hepatocyte assays, the hypothesis is that SR9009 will enhance circadian regulation of lipid metabolism, leading to the upregulation of β-oxidation genes such as CPT1A and MCAD. This upregulation should, in turn, lead to improved mitochondrial function and increased fatty acid oxidation, thereby reducing intracellular lipid accumulation and alleviating hepatic steatosis (Griffett et al., 2020). In animal models, particularly diet-induced obese mice that mimic human NASH pathology, treatment with SR9009 has been associated with a reduction in liver fat, improved systemic metabolic profiles including lowered plasma triglycerides and cholesterol, and a decrease in markers of inflammation and fibrosis (Griffett et al., 2020). The compound is anticipated to exert its effects specifically in hepatocytes where REV-ERBα is highly expressed, as well as in hepatic stellate cells that play a central role in fibrosis. REV-ERBα’s circadian regulation ensures that the timing of gene expression is optimized for lipid processing and energy expenditure; therefore, SR9009 is expected to restore the rhythmic expression of metabolic genes and improve hepatic energy balance (Griffett et al., 2022; Hong et al., 2021).

Moreover, the anti-inflammatory properties of SR9009 are expected to contribute to the overall therapeutic effect. By repressing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNFα, and IFNγ, SR9009 should reduce inflammation in the liver—an effect that is crucial given the role of hepatic inflammation in the progression of NAFLD to NASH (Griffett et al., 2020; Welch et al., 2022). This dual action—improving mitochondrial β-oxidation while concurrently reducing inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways—positions SR9009 as a compound that targets both the metabolic and inflammatory derangements observed in NASH. The oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile observed in rodent models further support its feasibility as a therapeutic candidate, although clinical safety data in humans are not yet available (Griffett et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, the data support SR9009 as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NASH, based on its mechanism as a REV-ERBα agonist and its demonstrated preclinical efficacy. The strengths of SR9009 include its synthetic origin allowing for potent REV-ERB activation, a well-characterized mechanism of action that involves the recruitment of co-repressor complexes to suppress lipogenic and inflammatory gene expression, and its ability to modulate circadian rhythms which are intimately linked with metabolic homeostasis. The preclinical studies provide compelling evidence that SR9009 can reduce hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and improve metabolic parameters in rodent models, all of which are critical endpoints in NASH (Griffett et al., 2020; Welch et al., 2022). The hypothesis that SR9009 will upregulate β-oxidation enzymes such as CPT1A and MCAD, thereby enhancing mitochondrial function and alleviating hepatic steatosis, is supported by its general role in improving oxidative metabolism and energy expenditure in animal models (Crouchet et al., 2025; Welch et al., 2022).

However, several weaknesses must also be noted. First, despite its promising preclinical profile, SR9009 has not yet been evaluated in clinical trials for NASH, leaving a translational gap that needs to be addressed before widespread therapeutic application can be considered (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while SR9009 has demonstrable effects on reducing inflammatory markers and fibrosis in rodent models, some studies have shown limited efficacy in reducing hepatic steatosis, indicating that its impact on lipid accumulation may be complex and context-dependent (Griffett et al., 2020). Furthermore, potential off-target effects and the need for optimization in terms of potency and pharmacokinetic properties remain areas for further investigation. It is also critical to establish direct evidence for the upregulation of mitochondrial β-oxidation genes and improvement in mitochondrial function within hepatocytes, as current data are largely inferred rather than explicitly measured (Griffett et al., 2022; Raza et al., 2022).

In conclusion, SR9009 represents a promising candidate for NASH therapy due to its multifactorial mechanism of action that aligns well with the complex pathophysiology of the disease. Its ability to activate REV-ERBα and thereby enhance circadian regulation of lipid metabolism, reduce inflammatory signaling, and potentially upregulate key β-oxidation enzymes positions it as an attractive therapeutic agent. Preclinical studies have provided solid evidence for its efficacy in improving metabolic parameters and reducing hepatic fibrosis and inflammation in rodent models of NASH. Nevertheless, before advancing SR9009 into clinical trials, further studies are needed to confirm its molecular effects in hepatocytes—particularly concerning mitochondrial function and the expression of enzymes like CPT1A and MCAD—and to optimize its pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. These studies will be crucial in determining whether the promising preclinical findings can translate into effective and safe therapeutic outcomes for patients with NASH (Griffett et al., 2020; Welch et al., 2022). Overall, while SR9009 has several compelling strengths as a repurposed drug candidate for NASH, its clinical utility will ultimately depend on overcoming translational challenges and validating its efficacy in human studies (Griffett et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

"A-769662 (Tocris Bioscience, Cat. #3748)","Proposal for A-769662 (Tocris Bioscience, Cat. #3748)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
A-769662 is a synthetic small‐molecule activator of AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) that was originally discovered through high‐throughput screening efforts undertaken by pharmaceutical researchers. It belongs to the thienopyridone family and is classified as a direct, allosteric AMPK activator. Unlike indirect activators such as metformin or AICAR, which modulate cellular AMP/ATP ratios, A-769662 binds specifically to the AMPK complex via its regulatory β subunit (Sanders et al., 2007; Zaks et al., 2014). Its chemical synthesis was designed to yield compounds that could directly stimulate AMPK without requiring upstream kinase input from LKB1 or CaMKKβ, although some interplay with upstream kinases is known (Sanders et al., 2007). This compound exemplifies a therapeutic class of agents that modulate metabolic pathways by directly enhancing the activity of key energy sensors. In the broader context, thienopyridone‐based AMPK activators have been investigated in metabolic disease preclinical models, where direct activation of AMPK has been postulated to trigger beneficial downstream effects in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis (Boudaba et al., 2018; Unknown Reference).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic potential of AMPK activation has been recognized for over two decades as a means to intervene in metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Early studies with indirect activators highlighted the enzyme’s role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. A-769662, as one of the first direct AMPK activators developed, has been used extensively in preclinical investigations to elucidate the role of AMPK in hepatic and peripheral tissues (Sanders et al., 2007; Boudaba et al., 2018). In animal models such as high-fat diet–induced steatosis in rodents, A-769662 has been shown to reduce hepatic lipid accumulation, improve insulin sensitivity, and attenuate markers of inflammation (Boudaba et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). Although its original development did not target Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) directly, subsequent studies have revealed that modulation of the AMPK/ACC/CPT1 axis – the central pathway through which A-769662 exerts its metabolic effects – is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of NASH. The compound’s excellent selectivity profile in animal models and its tolerability in rodents have raised the possibility of repurposing A-769662 for NASH treatment, even though it has not yet advanced into clinical trials specifically for NASH (Romero et al., 2020; Unknown Reference).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, A-769662 acts by binding to an allosteric site within the AMPK heterotrimer. More specifically, it interacts with a pocket at the interface between the kinase domain of the α subunit and the carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) of the β subunit, sometimes referred to as the ADaM (allosteric drug and metabolite) site (Sanders et al., 2007; Unknown Reference). This binding induces a conformational change that not only promotes the allosteric activation of AMPK but also protects the critical activation loop of the α subunit (Thr172) from dephosphorylation. By stabilizing the phosphorylated and active form of AMPK, A-769662 triggers the phosphorylation of several downstream targets. One principal target is acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), whose phosphorylation by AMPK results in its inactivation (Boudaba et al., 2018). Inactivation of ACC lowers intracellular malonyl-CoA levels, a key metabolic intermediate that normally acts as an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). The disinhibition of CPT1 enhances the translocation of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, thereby promoting their β-oxidation (Tarasiuk et al., 2022; Fang et al., 2022).
Furthermore, A-769662’s selective activation of AMPK occurs predominantly in complexes containing the β1 regulatory subunit (PRKAB1), and such isoform specificity is beneficial considering that the liver expresses these particular complexes, making it a prime target for modulating hepatic lipid metabolism (Sanders et al., 2007; Boudaba et al., 2018). Despite some off-target effects reported in other tissues – for example, inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase in kidney proximal tubular cells – the selectivity profile for the hepatic AMPK complex appears favorable in preclinical studies (Benziane et al., 2009). The detailed molecular interactions have been confirmed by various biochemical techniques, including phosphorylation assays and Western blots that consistently show increased Thr172 and ACC Ser79/Ser212 phosphorylation upon treatment with A-769662 (Boudaba et al., 2018; Sanders et al., 2007). These studies demonstrate that the compound not only activates AMPK but also results in a cascade of metabolic adjustments that collectively shift hepatocyte metabolism from lipid synthesis to enhanced fatty acid oxidation.

Expected Effect:
Based on the observed biochemical properties, the hypothesis is that A-769662 will enhance the phosphorylation of ACC, thereby lowering the levels of malonyl-CoA in NASH hepatocytes. This reduction in malonyl-CoA should relieve the inhibitory effect on CPT1, leading to an upregulation of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation (Boudaba et al., 2018; Fang et al., 2022). In practical terms, when A-769662 is administered to hepatocytes derived either from high-fat diet models or from human tissues that mimic NASH pathology, one should expect to see:

1. An increase in AMPK activity as evidenced by an elevation in Thr172 phosphorylation of the α subunit and increased phosphorylation of downstream targets such as ACC (Boudaba et al., 2018; Sanders et al., 2007).
2. A marked decrease in intracellular malonyl-CoA levels, which would otherwise inhibit CPT1; hence, a biochemical assay would reveal lower malonyl-CoA levels upon treatment (Boudaba et al., 2018).
3. Enhanced activity of CPT1, measurable by increased rates of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation as seen by respirometry assays and lipid oxidation markers in both rodent and human hepatocyte cultures (Tarasiuk et al., 2022; Fang et al., 2022).
4. Ultimately, a reduction in hepatic triglyceride accumulation and overall improvement in lipid metabolic profiles within the liver, which is a central pathology of NASH (Zhang et al., 2018; Romero et al., 2020).

Given the expression patterns of AMPK subunits PRKAA1 and PRKAA2 and the regulatory interplay with PRKAB1 in liver tissue, the expected effect is that treatment with A-769662 in hepatocytes diagnosed with NASH will normalize aberrant lipid metabolism by shifting the balance from de novo lipogenesis toward enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. This mechanism logically supports a reduction in hepatocellular steatosis, as demonstrated in rodent models where chronic administration of AMPK activators correlates with improved insulin sensitivity and decreased liver fat (Boudaba et al., 2018; Romero et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
A-769662 emerges as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis, based on its well-characterized mechanism of action, selectivity profile, and preclinical efficacy in modulating hepatic lipid metabolism. Its advantages include:

• Direct Activation of AMPK:
Unlike indirect activators such as metformin, A-769662 directly binds to the AMPK complex and exerts its effects without altering the cellular AMP:ATP ratio. This direct activation ensures that the downstream phosphorylation of crucial metabolic enzymes, especially ACC, is robust and sustained. The specificity for AMPK β1-containing complexes further means that the drug is well-targeted to tissues like the liver, where this isoform is abundantly expressed (Sanders et al., 2007; Boudaba et al., 2018).

• Mechanistic Clarity and Downstream Effects:
The compound’s mechanism of action is not only well-delineated but also links mechanistically to the metabolic pathways that are dysregulated in NASH. The activation of AMPK leads to ACC phosphorylation, lowered malonyl-CoA, enhanced CPT1 activity, and increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation – a cascade that directly addresses hepatic steatosis by reducing lipid accumulation. Preclinical studies support these mechanistic insights and show that improvements in AMPK signaling correlate with reductions in liver triglyceride content (Boudaba et al., 2018; Unknown Reference).

• Efficacy in Preclinical Models:
Rodent studies using A-769662 or similar direct AMPK activators have demonstrated promising results, including reduced hepatic steatosis, improved insulin sensitivity, and enhanced mitochondrial respiration in hepatocyte cultures. These preclinical data suggest that the compound’s beneficial metabolic effects are transferrable to human physiology, pointing toward its potential translation for NASH treatment (Zhang et al., 2018; Romero et al., 2020).

• Favorable Tolerability and Selectivity:
A-769662 has been shown to have a favorable tolerability profile in animal models with minimal off-target effects when used at low micromolar concentrations. While some reports have indicated off-target effects (such as inhibition of the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase in renal cells), the selectivity toward hepatic AMPK makes it a viable candidate for repurposing in NASH, given that dosing in the liver is achievable at concentrations that activate the target without eliciting systemic toxicity (Benziane et al., 2009; Zaks et al., 2014).

• Clinical Rationale and Unmet Need:
Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis currently lacks approved pharmacological treatments, and there is a significant unmet need for agents that can directly target the metabolic dysfunction at the heart of this disease. The mode of action of A-769662 – promoting fatty acid β-oxidation while inhibiting de novo lipogenesis – directly addresses key pathogenic mechanisms in NASH. The clinical development of other AMPK activators in related metabolic conditions further supports the idea that targeting this pathway can yield positive therapeutic outcomes (Romero et al., 2020; Unknown Reference).

However, there are some caveats and potential challenges:

• Translation from Preclinical Models to Humans:
While the preclinical data are encouraging, it is crucial to validate the effects of A-769662 in human hepatocytes and to evaluate its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in human subjects. Although in vitro and rodent data have shown improvement in mitochondrial respiration and reduced hepatic lipid accumulation, the translational gap remains a common challenge in drug development for NASH (Boudaba et al., 2018; Romero et al., 2020).

• Potential Off-target Effects:
Although A-769662 has a relatively high selectivity for AMPK β1-containing heterotrimers, there have been reports of off-target interactions, such as inhibition of Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity in kidney cells. It will be important to determine whether such effects may limit the therapeutic index or present safety concerns in the context of chronic treatment for NASH. Detailed dose-response assessments and comprehensive toxicity profiling in clinical settings will be required to fully address these concerns (Benziane et al., 2009).

• Bioavailability and Clinical Formulation:
Some AMPK activators suffer from poor bioavailability or unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties that hinder clinical translation. It is therefore incumbent upon ongoing research efforts to improve the formulation and delivery characteristics of A-769662, perhaps by chemical modification or by developing targeted delivery systems to the liver (Chen et al., 2023; Romero et al., 2020).

In summary, the current literature suggests that A-769662 has significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis. Its mechanism—the direct allosteric activation of AMPK leading to enhanced ACC phosphorylation, lowered malonyl-CoA levels, disinhibition of CPT1, and upregulation of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation—is directly aligned with the pathogenic underpinnings of NASH. Preclinical studies in rodent high-fat diet models and human hepatocyte assays provide a strong rationale that this compound could effectively ameliorate hepatic steatosis, a central feature of NASH (Sanders et al., 2007; Boudaba et al., 2018; Romero et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2018; Tarasiuk et al., 2022). While challenges remain in translating these findings into clinical practice—particularly regarding bioavailability, potential off-target effects, and confirmation of efficacy in human tissues—the mechanistic clarity and preclinical efficacy data represent key strengths that support further development of A-769662 as a novel pharmacological intervention for NASH. Thus, based on the comprehensive review of biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature, A-769662 is a promising candidate to pursue in our drug development program for NASH, warranting additional preclinical validation and eventual progression to early-stage clinical trials.

"BAM15 (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #SML0763)","Proposal for BAM15 (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #SML0763)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
BAM15 is a synthetic mitochondrial protonophore that was originally discovered through high‐throughput chemical screening designed to identify compounds that could safely increase mitochondrial oxygen consumption without the deleterious off‐target effects typically observed with classical uncouplers such as 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) or FCCP (Alexopoulos, 2023; Kenwood et al., 2014). Chemically, BAM15 belongs to a novel class of oxadiazolo-pyrazine derivatives that exhibit protonophoric activity by selectively targeting the mitochondrial inner membrane, thereby facilitating proton leak and uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis (Alexopoulos, 2023; Kenwood & Hoehn, 2014). Unlike earlier mitochondrial uncouplers, BAM15 has been engineered to demonstrate a broad effective dosing window, high mitochondrial specificity, and a reduced propensity to depolarize the plasma membrane, which has historically limited the therapeutic application of uncouplers due to toxicity concerns (Kenwood et al., 2014; Shrestha et al., 2021). The compound is commercially available from suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich (Cat. #SML0763) and is currently being repurposed from its research applications into potential therapeutic use for metabolic disorders, most notably non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), due to its ability to enhance cellular fatty acid oxidation and improve mitochondrial function (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
BAM15 has primarily been investigated in preclinical settings with a focus on mitochondrial bioenergetics and metabolic modulation. Recent studies using rodent models of diet-induced obesity and NASH have shown that BAM15 administration leads to improved mitochondrial respiratory capacity, increased energy expenditure, and reductions in hepatic triglyceride content (Alexopoulos, 2023). In these studies, BAM15 not only promoted fat loss but also improved insulin sensitivity and reversed hyperinsulinemia in animals fed obesogenic diets, suggesting its utility in metabolic conditions that share pathophysiological features with NASH (Alexopoulos, 2023; Xiong et al., 2023). While BAM15’s historical record in clinical practice remains that of an investigational drug—its use has been confined to research laboratories and preclinical studies—it stands apart from classical mitochondrial uncouplers like DNP, which were previously investigated for obesity but ultimately discontinued due to a narrow therapeutic window and safety liabilities (Alexopoulos, 2023; Kenwood et al., 2014). The extensive preclinical data to date, including robust pharmacokinetic profiles indicating oral bioavailability (approximately 67%) and a moderate half-life (approximately 1.7 hours in mice), further support the potential repurposing of BAM15 for therapeutic intervention in NASH, a disease highly characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired fatty acid oxidation, and hepatic lipid overload (Alexopoulos, 2023; Boeira et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
BAM15 exerts its pharmacological effects via a well-characterized mechanism of mitochondrial uncoupling. At the molecular level, BAM15 functions as a protonophore; it facilitates the translocation of protons (H⁺) across the mitochondrial inner membrane independent of ATP synthase activity, resulting in a dissipation of the proton motive force that is otherwise coupled to ATP production (Alexopoulos, 2023; Xiong et al., 2023). This controlled uncoupling leads to increased oxygen consumption and substrate oxidation as mitochondria compensate for the loss of coupling efficiency, thereby enhancing fatty acid β-oxidation—a key metabolic process impaired in NASH (Alexopoulos, 2023; Axelrod et al., 2020). Importantly, BAM15’s action is selective for mitochondria due to its lipophilic nature and higher pKa, which restricts its activity to the mitochondrial environment and prevents deleterious plasma membrane depolarization typically seen with other uncoupling agents (Kenwood et al., 2014; Shrestha et al., 2021). Additionally, BAM15 has been shown to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of energy metabolism that enhances glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation while suppressing de novo lipogenesis (Axelrod et al., 2020; Dang et al., 2021). The compound also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, possibly by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and restraining inflammatory cytokine release, which is beneficial in the context of NASH where chronic inflammation contributes to disease progression (Xiong et al., 2023; Dang et al., 2021). Collectively, these molecular interactions indicate that BAM15 improves hepatocellular metabolism by boosting substrate oxidation via increased mitochondrial respiration, reducing the accumulation of lipotoxic species in the liver without inducing systemic hyperthermia (Alexopoulos, 2023; Kenwood & Hoehn, 2014).

Expected Effect:
In the context of Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis, BAM15 is hypothesized to achieve beneficial effects by subtly uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation in hepatocytes. This mild uncoupling is expected to boost the rate of substrate oxidation and, in particular, enhance fatty acid β-oxidation, thereby reducing hepatic lipid overload—a central pathological feature of NASH (Alexopoulos, 2023; Xiong et al., 2023). Experimental data from rodent models have already demonstrated that BAM15 administration results in significant reductions in liver triglycerides and improvements in insulin sensitivity; these metabolic benefits directly translate to an amelioration of NASH-related liver pathology, as evidenced by improved histological scores such as the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) and reduced levels of plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (Alexopoulos, 2023). The expected outcome in hepatocyte assays is an increase in the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating effective uncoupling and increased fatty acid oxidation, as measured, for instance, by Seahorse respirometry assays (Alexopoulos, 2023; Xiong et al., 2023). Moreover, since the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway is known to be upregulated in response to energy stress such as that induced by mitochondrial uncoupling, further activation of AMPK is anticipated; this would serve to enhance glucose uptake and suppress lipogenic gene expression in hepatocytes, contributing to the overall metabolic improvement observed in preclinical studies (Axelrod et al., 2020; Dang et al., 2021). Additional supportive evidence from studies evaluating mitochondrial uncouplers in similar settings, including experiments in isolated hepatocytes and in vivo rodent models, reinforces the notion that BAM15 will reduce ectopic fat accumulation, alleviate oxidative stress, and exert anti-inflammatory effects via its modulation of mitochondrial respiration (Alexopoulos, 2023; Xiong et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on the comprehensive literature review, BAM15 emerges as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis. Its origins as a synthetically derived mitochondrial uncoupler that has been rationally designed to overcome the safety liabilities of traditional uncoupling agents (e.g., DNP and FCCP) provide a strong foundation for targeted metabolic modulation (Kenwood et al., 2014; Alexopoulos, 2023). One of the primary strengths of BAM15 is its mechanism of action; by subtly uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, it increases mitochondrial substrate oxidation and fatty acid β-oxidation in hepatocytes without inducing hyperthermia or significant cytotoxicity—a major limitation of many earlier compounds in this class (Xiong et al., 2023; Axelrod et al., 2020). The activation of AMPK further supports its favorable metabolic profile, as AMPK acts as an energy sensor that encourages catabolic processes and reduces lipogenesis, ultimately contributing to a reduction in hepatic lipid accumulation and an improvement in overall metabolic homeostasis (Axelrod et al., 2020; Dang et al., 2021). Preclinical data in rodents, including improved insulin sensitivity, decreased liver triglyceride content, and favorable histopathological changes in diet-induced NASH models, provide compelling evidence of its therapeutic potential (Alexopoulos, 2023).

However, some challenges remain that could impact the clinical translation of BAM15. Its poor aqueous solubility limits formulation options and may require innovative delivery approaches—such as dietary admixture or nanoparticle encapsulation—to achieve consistent systemic exposure (Alexopoulos, 2023; Xiong et al., 2023). Additionally, although rodent pharmacokinetic profiles are encouraging with acceptable bioavailability and a moderate half-life, further investigation in higher-order preclinical models and eventual human studies will be necessary to fully assess long-term safety and efficacy, as well as potential off-target effects that might not be captured in short-term studies (Alexopoulos, 2023; Kenwood & Hoehn, 2014). The mechanistic specificity of BAM15 as demonstrated by its minimal plasma membrane depolarization and favorable mitochondrial targeting represents a significant advancement; yet, given the complex pathogenesis of NASH—where inflammation, lipotoxicity, and fibrogenesis intersect—the therapeutic efficacy of BAM15 may need to be validated as part of combination regimens rather than as a standalone treatment (Kenwood et al., 2014; Alexopoulos, 2023).

In summary, BAM15’s strengths lie in its well-defined molecular mechanism, enhanced mitochondrial specificity, safety profile in preclinical rodent models, and its ability to effectively modulate key metabolic pathways implicated in NASH pathology. Its potential to reduce hepatic lipid accumulation and improve insulin sensitivity while avoiding the hyperthermic and cytotoxic side effects associated with older mitochondrial uncouplers makes it a compelling candidate for further development (Alexopoulos, 2023; Xiong et al., 2023). The primary weaknesses are related to formulation challenges due to low aqueous solubility and the need for extensive further studies to confirm long-term safety and efficacy in human-relevant models (Alexopoulos, 2023; Kenwood & Hoehn, 2014). Overall, the evidence supports pursuing additional preclinical development of BAM15, with particular emphasis on optimizing its pharmacokinetic properties and establishing robust efficacy endpoints in suitable NASH models before moving toward clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

"Honokiol (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #H4910)","Proposal for Honokiol (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #H4910)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Honokiol is a natural biphenolic compound that is primarily isolated from the bark, seed cones, and leaves of Magnolia species, particularly Magnolia officinalis and Magnolia obovata, which are prominent in traditional East Asian medicine (Arora et al., 2012). Chemically classified as a biphenyl neolignan, honokiol exhibits a distinctive structure composed of two phenolic rings linked via a biaryl bond; this structure is responsible not only for its intrinsic antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties but also for its ability to modulate multiple signaling pathways in the cell (Faysal et al., 2023). The compound can be obtained through natural extraction from Magnolia bark, as well as synthesized by chemical methodologies that reproduce its unique biphenolic framework, and various derivative modifications have been developed to enhance its bioactivity and pharmacokinetic profile (Maioli et al., 2018). As a member of the natural product-based therapeutic class, honokiol belongs to a broader group of phytochemicals that have historically been used not only in traditional herbal preparations but also as lead compounds in modern drug discovery for their pleiotropic effects, which include anticancer, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and anti-inflammatory activities (Ong et al., 2019). This long history of use coupled with recent biochemical insights positions honokiol as an intriguing candidate for repurposing in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), where its multifaceted effects on mitochondrial function and cellular signaling hold therapeutic promise (Faysal et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, honokiol has been used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine for centuries, primarily for its anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety, and antioxidative properties; traditional preparations of Magnolia bark have been employed to treat a variety of ailments ranging from respiratory disorders to gastrointestinal disturbances (Arora et al., 2012). In modern biomedical research, honokiol’s pharmacological activities were initially explored in the context of cancer prevention and therapy; preclinical studies have demonstrated its ability to induce apoptosis, inhibit angiogenesis, suppress cell proliferation, and overcome drug resistance in various tumor models, including those of breast, lung, and colon cancers (Arora et al., 2012; Ong et al., 2019). Its potent antioxidant properties have further led to investigations into its neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects, as evidenced by studies showing honokiol’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and reduce oxidative stress in models of cerebral ischemia and cardiac hypertrophy (Pillai et al., 2015; Faysal et al., 2023). More recently, honokiol has been evaluated in preclinical models of metabolic liver disease; for instance, studies using high-fat diet-induced models in mice showed a decrease in hepatic lipid accumulation and improved mitochondrial respiration following honokiol treatment, thus suggesting beneficial effects in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form, NASH (Liu et al., 2021; Seo et al., 2015). Although robust clinical trial data in NASH patients remain limited, the body of preclinical and observational studies establishes a strong rationale for further investigation of honokiol’s hepatoprotective properties in metabolic disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
The hypothesized mechanism of action for honokiol in the context of NASH centers on its ability to activate SIRT3—a mitochondrial NAD⁺-dependent deacetylase that is critical for the regulation of mitochondrial function, fatty acid β-oxidation, and oxidative stress management (Treviño-Saldaña & García-Rivas, 2017). Activation of SIRT3 leads to the deacetylation of key mitochondrial enzymes, including long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), which plays a pivotal role in facilitating mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids. Indeed, preclinical studies in rodents have demonstrated that honokiol treatment increases SIRT3 expression and enzymatic activity, resulting in decreased acetylation of LCAD, enhanced fatty acid oxidation flux, and improved mitochondrial respiration (Liu et al., 2021; Pillai et al., 2015). Additionally, honokiol has been reported to activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway via direct binding to the AMPKγ1 subunit; this dual activation of AMPK and SIRT3 is particularly beneficial in hepatocytes as AMPK activation not only stimulates fatty acid oxidation but also inhibits lipogenic pathways by reducing the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and other related lipogenic genes (Tian et al., 2023; Seo et al., 2015). At the biochemical level, honokiol’s interaction with SIRT3 is thought to involve direct binding, potentially improving the deacetylation state of mitochondrial proteins and thereby restoring mitochondrial bioenergetics; this is crucial in the setting of NASH, where mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired fatty acid oxidation contribute significantly to hepatic steatosis and inflammation (Treviño-Saldaña & García-Rivas, 2017; Liu et al., 2021). Moreover, through modulation of signaling pathways related to oxidative stress (e.g., NRF2) and inflammatory mediators (e.g., NF-κB), honokiol exhibits a multi-targeted approach to dampen the intracellular stress responses that exacerbate liver injury in NASH (Zhai et al., 2020). Collectively, these molecular interactions and the resultant shift toward enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation and reduced lipogenesis form the core of honokiol’s proposed mechanism in mitigating hepatic steatosis and progression to NASH.

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay, honokiol is expected to activate SIRT3 in NASH hepatocytes, thereby leading to enhanced deacetylation and activation of mitochondrial enzymes involved in β-oxidation. Experimental assays using hepatocyte cell lines (such as AML12 or HepG2) treated with honokiol are predicted to show a decrease in lipid accumulation as measured by triglyceride content and Nile red staining, concomitant with increased expression and enzymatic activity of SIRT3 (Liu et al., 2021; Treviño-Saldaña & García-Rivas, 2017). In addition to an upregulation of SIRT3 activity, the downstream effects should include a reduction in the acetylation levels of mitochondrial β-oxidation enzymes such as LCAD, leading to increased fatty acid oxidation capacity within the mitochondria (Liu et al., 2021; Pillai et al., 2015). It is anticipated that these biochemical changes will translate into improved mitochondrial respiratory function, as evidenced by increased oxygen consumption rates in mitochondrial assays, and a concomitant reduction in overall hepatic steatosis, as observed in high-fat diet mouse models (Tian et al., 2023; Seo et al., 2015). Furthermore, activation of AMPK in conjunction with SIRT3 by honokiol is expected to produce an anti-inflammatory effect by downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways, which is critical in the context of NASH where inflammation drives disease progression (Tian et al., 2023; Seo et al., 2015). Importantly, hepatocytes express both SIRT3 and AMPK, underscoring the relevance of the proposed mechanism in this cell type and supporting the hypothesis that honokiol treatment will lead to a net increase in mitochondrial β-oxidation and a corresponding decrease in hepatic lipid accumulation (Liu et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
Honokiol represents a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NASH based on several lines of evidence derived from biochemical, preclinical, and mechanistic studies. Its natural origin from Magnolia species, coupled with a long history of use in traditional medicine, provides a solid historical basis for its favorable safety profile and multi-targeted pharmacological effects (Arora et al., 2012; Ong et al., 2019). One of the major strengths of honokiol lies in its dual mechanism of action—activation of SIRT3 and AMPK—that synergistically enhances mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation while simultaneously reducing lipogenesis and inflammation. This dual pathway activation is particularly advantageous in NASH, where impaired mitochondrial function and increased oxidative stress play central roles in disease pathogenesis (Liu et al., 2021; Tian et al., 2023). Preclinical models, including in vitro hepatocyte assays and in vivo high-fat diet mouse studies, have provided compelling evidence that honokiol treatment leads to improvements in lipid metabolism, as indicated by reduced hepatic triglycerides and enhanced mitochondrial respiration (Seo et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2023). Additionally, honokiol’s capacity to decrease the acetylation of key mitochondrial enzymes through SIRT3 activation aligns well with the observed benefits in rodent models, suggesting a restoration of mitochondrial function that is likely to be beneficial in NASH (Treviño-Saldaña & García-Rivas, 2017; Pillai et al., 2015).

However, there are some challenges and weaknesses that require consideration. Most of the evidence supporting honokiol’s efficacy in NASH comes from preclinical studies, and robust clinical trial data in human NASH patients remain scarce (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, while the mechanistic underpinnings involving SIRT3 activation and subsequent enhancement of mitochondrial β-oxidation are biologically plausible, the precise molecular details of honokiol’s interaction with SIRT3 still warrant further elucidation, including its binding kinetics and potential off-target effects (Treviño-Saldaña & García-Rivas, 2017). There is also the issue of bioavailability and pharmacokinetics; although honokiol has favorable oral bioavailability and can cross the blood–brain barrier, its rapid metabolism and clearance (via glucuronidation and sulfation) in the liver might necessitate the development of novel formulations or the use of delivery systems, such as liposomal encapsulation, to achieve steady therapeutic concentrations in target tissues (Arora et al., 2012; Maioli et al., 2018). In addition, given that AMPK activation is a common mechanism shared by various bioactive compounds, distinguishing honokiol’s unique contributions to SIRT3-mediated mitochondrial activation relative to other known AMPK activators may prove challenging when designing definitive clinical studies (Tian et al., 2023; Seo et al., 2015).

Despite these hurdles, the overall profile of honokiol is attractive due to its natural origin, its multi-targeted action on key metabolic regulators, and the compelling preclinical data suggesting that it improves mitochondrial function and reduces hepatic steatosis in models of NAFLD/NASH (Liu et al., 2021; Tian et al., 2023). The combination of SIRT3 activation, enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation, and downregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways addresses multiple pathological features of NASH, which is a complex disease with both metabolic and inflammatory components (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Liu et al., 2021). In conclusion, while further research is needed to validate honokiol’s efficacy in clinical settings and to optimize its delivery and pharmacokinetic properties, the current body of evidence supports continued investigation into honokiol as a potentially effective therapeutic candidate for NASH. Its ability to modulate mitochondrial metabolism and reduce hepatic lipid accumulation makes it a unique and compelling candidate for drug repurposing in the treatment of metabolic liver disease.

"GW501516 (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #PZ0265)","Proposal for GW501516 (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #PZ0265)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
GW501516 is a fully synthetic, high‐potency agonist for the peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor delta (PPARδ), also widely known by its trade name Cardarine. It was originally discovered and developed by GlaxoSmithKline as part of an effort to identify compounds that could favorably modulate lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis in the context of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. The compound was synthesized through combinatorial chemistry and structure-based drug design, leading to a molecule that exhibits subnanomolar affinity for PPARδ, thus enabling robust receptor activation at very low concentrations (Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023). GW501516 belongs to the class of selective PPARδ agonists, a group of nuclear receptor modulators that have been extensively investigated for their ability to enhance fatty acid oxidation and improve metabolic profiles in a range of experimental models. Historically, similar compounds have been employed in animal studies as metabolic enhancers, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle and increasing endurance performance, although they have not been approved for clinical use due primarily to safety concerns identified in long-term studies (Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic rationale for GW501516 lies in its proven capacity to modulate lipid metabolism and energy expenditure. In preclinical studies conducted using high‐fat diet rodent models, GW501516 has been shown to reduce hepatic triglyceride levels and improve systemic metabolic parameters such as insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, and markers of oxidative stress (Gellrich & Merk, 2017; Chen et al., 2015). It has been evaluated in multiple early clinical programs including Phase 2 and exploratory studies that assessed its effects on circulating lipid fractions and inflammatory markers in subjects with dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome, with one notable study evaluating its impact on high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides in a controlled, short‐term setting (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2004). Although its initial intended use was for the treatment of dyslipidemia and related cardiovascular conditions, the observation that GW501516 induces key genes involved in fatty acid oxidation has since spurred interest in its potential repurposing for non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Preclinical models of NASH and fatty liver disease have demonstrated that PPARδ agonism can reduce liver fat content and inflammation, which provides a promising rationale for exploring GW501516 in this context (Gellrich & Merk, 2017). Nevertheless, despite these extensive preclinical findings and early-phase clinical data, long-term safety concerns—particularly related to carcinogenesis identified in rodent studies—have curtailed its clinical development for metabolic disease indications (Gellrich & Merk, 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, GW501516 exerts its effects through binding to and activating PPARδ, a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that regulates the transcription of numerous genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and energy metabolism. Upon ligand binding, PPARδ heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds to specific peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. This transcriptional activation results in the upregulation of key enzymes such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), which is essential for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria, acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), the rate-limiting enzyme in peroxisomal β-oxidation, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), which diverts pyruvate away from glucose oxidation to promote fatty acid utilization (Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023; Chen et al., 2015). Additionally, GW501516 activates AMPK and enhances the expression of PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), further promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and increasing oxidative capacity in metabolically active tissues such as skeletal muscle and the liver (Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023; Chen et al., 2015). This coordinated effort not only enhances the cellular capacity for fatty acid oxidation but also contributes to a reduction in hepatic lipid accumulation and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine production. In vitro reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies have confirmed that GW501516 prompts direct binding of PPARδ to the promoters of fatty acid oxidation genes, thereby validating its ability to initiate a transcriptional program supportive of enhanced lipid catabolism (Gellrich & Merk, 2017). Ultimately, the molecular cascade initiated by GW501516 may translate into improved metabolic functions, including reduced liver fat content, enhanced insulin sensitivity, and decreased inflammatory signaling—hallmarks of effective NASH therapy.

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the evaluation of GW501516 in the context of NASH is that its potent activation of PPARδ will result in upregulation of genes pivotal to fatty acid oxidation, thereby increasing mitochondrial oxidative capacity in hepatocytes. In practical assays, this is expected to manifest as a significant elevation in the expression of CPT1A, ACOX1, and PDK4 mRNA and protein levels, leading to an enhancement in the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids. These molecular events should result in a measurable decrease in intracellular lipid accumulation, a key pathological feature of NASH. Furthermore, by boosting fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial function, GW501516 should concomitantly reduce the generation of lipotoxic intermediates that contribute to endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation within the liver tissue (Gellrich & Merk, 2017; Chen et al., 2015). In high-fat diet rodents and in cell culture models employing hepatocyte-derived cell lines, treatment with GW501516 has been associated with decreased liver fat content, lower levels of circulating triglycerides, and attenuation of inflammatory markers such as IL-1β and caspase-1, the latter being components of the inflammasome complex involved in mediating liver inflammation (Lee et al., 2015; Nagasawa et al., 2006). Given that hepatocytes express high levels of PPARδ under conditions of metabolic stress and that these cells are integral to lipid metabolism, the expected activation by GW501516 aligns well with the observed pathology in NASH (Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023). In sum, the use of GW501516 in NASH hepatocyte assays is anticipated to decrease lipid accumulation and inflammation through a well-characterized PPARδ-mediated enhancement of mitochondrial oxidative capacity and fatty acid metabolism.

Overall Evaluation:
GW501516 presents as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NASH, primarily due to its robust mechanism of action that targets a central pathway in hepatic lipid metabolism. Its ability to potently activate PPARδ, thereby upregulating genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis, addresses two core pathophysiological aspects of NASH: the accumulation of fat in hepatocytes and the inflammatory processes that lead to liver injury and fibrosis (Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023; Gellrich & Merk, 2017). Preclinical data, encompassing both biochemical assays and animal model studies, provide strong evidence that GW501516 can lower liver triglyceride levels and improve metabolic parameters, which are directly relevant to the treatment of metabolic liver diseases (Chen et al., 2015; Nagasawa et al., 2006).

One of the major strengths of this candidate is its high potency, enabling activation of PPARδ at subnanomolar concentrations, which is key for achieving therapeutic efficacy with potentially lower doses and reduced off-target effects. This is complemented by its well-elucidated molecular mechanism that links receptor activation to transcriptional upregulation of critical enzymes such as CPT1A, ACOX1, and PDK4. The robust in vitro and in vivo data indicating enhanced fatty acid oxidation and improved lipid handling in hepatocytes and other metabolic tissues make a compelling case for advancement toward NASH-oriented applications (Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023; Gellrich & Merk, 2017).

However, the candidate is not without significant challenges. The most prominent weakness lies in its safety profile, particularly the carcinogenicity observed in long-term animal studies. While these safety concerns have been a major factor in halting its development for other indications such as dyslipidemia, there is a rationale that short-course regimens might mitigate the associated risks when applied to NASH, given that the therapeutic window for NASH may be shorter and the dosing lower than that required for chronic cardiovascular indications (Gellrich & Merk, 2017; Mitchell & Bishop‐Bailey, 2019). Nonetheless, the potential for oncogenesis remains a critical area of concern and would necessitate rigorous preclinical safety studies focusing specifically on dose, duration, and timing in the context of liver disease before any clinical trial can be considered.

Another potential challenge is the specificity of the metabolic effects to hepatocytes. While increased fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle and other tissues is beneficial for systemic metabolism, the impact of GW501516 on hepatocyte function and on the progression of liver fibrosis in NASH remains to be fully elucidated. Some preclinical studies have suggested that while PPARδ activation effectively reduces lipid accumulation and improves insulin sensitivity, its effects on hepatic fibrosis and inflammation can be modest compared to dual PPARα/δ agonists such as elafibranor (Gellrich & Merk, 2017). This indicates that while GW501516 may be highly effective in reducing steatosis, its efficacy in addressing the full spectrum of NASH pathology, particularly fibrosis, may require combination therapy or a multi-target approach.

In conclusion, GW501516 demonstrates significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for NASH. Its strong mechanistic foundation based on PPARδ activation, subsequent enhancement of fatty acid oxidation gene expression, and demonstrated improvements in metabolic parameters in preclinical studies are clear strengths that support further investigation in controlled, short-course studies for NASH. However, the lingering safety concerns, particularly the risk of carcinogenesis, represent a major weakness that must be carefully evaluated and mitigated through focused preclinical toxicology studies and intelligent trial design. Given these considerations, GW501516 merits further investigation in the context of NASH, with a potential strategy involving limited-duration treatment regimens and rigorous monitoring of oncologic safety biomarkers. Overall, while the candidate’s profound metabolic effects justify its evaluation, any clinical application will require a careful balance between efficacy and safety, with a particular emphasis on short-term treatments that provide metabolic benefit without triggering adverse long-term outcomes (Bianchi & Locatelli, 2023; Gellrich & Merk, 2017).

"SRT1720 (Cayman Chemical, Cat. #12010)","Proposal for SRT1720 (Cayman Chemical, Cat. #12010)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SRT1720 is a synthetic small‐molecule activator developed to target sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a NAD⁺‐dependent deacetylase that plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress responses. This compound, available from Cayman Chemical (Cat. #12010), belongs to the class of SIRT1 activators—agents designed to mimic or enhance the enzyme’s natural activity. SRT1720 was discovered through high‐throughput screening efforts and later structurally optimized to achieve an approximately 1,000‐fold higher potency than naturally occurring polyphenols such as resveratrol (Farghali, Kemelo, & Canová, 2019). In synthetic origin, SRT1720 is chemically engineered to interact specifically with the SIRT1 enzyme‐substrate complex, thereby facilitating substrate deacetylation. Early studies emphasized its efficacy in rodent models of metabolic disease by demonstrating improvements in insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial respiration, and lipid homeostasis (Minor et al., 2011). This class of compounds has traditionally been evaluated for their anti‐aging, anti‐inflammatory, and metabolic regulatory properties, with several preclinical studies indicating that selective activation of SIRT1 can ameliorate hepatic steatosis and oxidative damage—a critical factor in liver diseases such as Non‐alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) (Chen, Lu, & Yang, 2025).

Therapeutic History:
SRT1720 has been extensively studied in preclinical animal models that mimic aspects of metabolic dysfunction associated with high‐fat diet feeding. Multiple studies have demonstrated that administration of SRT1720 in obese mice leads to significant reductions in hepatic lipid accumulation, improvement in mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and enhancements in overall energy metabolism (Minor et al., 2011). In rodent models, SRT1720 treatment has reduced markers of liver injury such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), suggesting an amelioration of fatty liver features that are characteristic of Non‐alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) (Minor et al., 2011). Although SRT1720 was originally explored with the aim of extending lifespan and improving metabolic parameters in models of obesity and type 2 diabetes, its effects on hepatic biology have drawn attention to its potential application in chronic liver diseases. The available literature shows that SIRT1 activators—both natural (like resveratrol) and synthetic (such as SRT1720)—have been associated with improvements in mitochondrial biogenesis, antioxidant defense, and lipid metabolism in liver tissues (Farghali, Kemelo, & Canová, 2019). Despite these promising biochemical and histopathological outcomes in animal models, no clinical trials to date have been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov for SRT1720 in the treatment of NASH (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), indicating that its clinical development for this specific indication remains at a preclinical stage.

Mechanism of Action:
SRT1720 functions as a pharmacological activator of SIRT1, leading to enhanced deacetylase activity on a range of substrates that are critically involved in metabolic regulation and mitochondrial function. At the molecular level, SIRT1 exerts its effects by removing acetyl groups from target proteins, thereby modulating their activity, stability, and localization. A primary focus of SIRT1-mediated deacetylation is the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). Deacetylation of PGC-1α by SIRT1 leads to its activation, which in turn promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and enhances oxidative phosphorylation efficiency (Chen, Lu, & Yang, 2025). This activation results in upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, notably including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), which are essential enzymes for shifting the hepatocellular energy balance towards increased β-oxidation of fatty acids. In addition to upregulating β-oxidation, SIRT1 activation under the influence of SRT1720 also contributes to the suppression of lipogenic transcription factors, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP). This downregulation of lipogenesis reduces the synthesis of new fatty acids, which is a central component of steatosis. Moreover, enhanced SIRT1 activity is associated with secondary deacetylation of other key regulators involved in oxidative stress and inflammation, including forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), thereby bolstering antioxidant defenses and mitigating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Chen, Lu, & Yang, 2025; Minor et al., 2011). This dual benefit of enhancing mitochondrial oxidative capacity while reducing oxidative stress has been observed in cellular assays, where treatment with SRT1720 increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption, ATP levels, and decreased markers of lipid peroxidation (Minor et al., 2011).

Expected Effect:
Based on the robust preclinical data and molecular insights, the application of SRT1720 in NASH is expected to yield multi-faceted improvements in hepatic metabolism. In NASH hepatocytes, where mitochondrial dysfunction, steatosis, and oxidative damage are prevalent, SRT1720 is anticipated to activate SIRT1 efficiently at sub-micromolar concentrations (EC₅₀ ∼0.16 μM). This activation will lead to deacetylation and subsequent activation of PGC-1α, a pivotal event that drives the transcription of genes encoding mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation enzymes such as CPT1A and MCAD (Chen, Lu, & Yang, 2025). Since PGC-1α is known to be abundantly expressed in hepatocytes and critical for maintaining mitochondrial biogenesis and functionality, its activation is expected to lead to an increase in the number and efficiency of mitochondria, thereby enhancing β-oxidation of fatty acids. This metabolic shift should result in the reduction of intracellular lipid droplets or steatosis within hepatocytes. Additionally, by promoting the deacetylation of transcription factors responsible for oxidative stress responses (for example, Nrf2 and FoxO1), SRT1720 is expected to decrease the levels of ROS and improve the overall redox balance in liver cells, ultimately reducing oxidative damage and inflammation (Minor et al., 2011; Hang et al., 2021). The improved mitochondrial function and enhanced antioxidant defenses are predicted to lower circulating markers of liver injury (e.g., ALT and AST), ameliorate hepatocellular injury, and improve insulin sensitivity in metabolic liver disease models—a combination of effects that directly addresses the pathophysiological features of NASH. Pharmacokinetic studies have further indicated that SRT1720 exhibits adequate liver exposure in preclinical species, and tolerability data suggest that dosing is safe in rodent models, thereby supporting the translational potential of this therapeutic candidate (Wan, 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
The cumulative preclinical data provide strong support for the potential of SRT1720 as a repurposed candidate for the treatment of NASH. One of the key strengths of SRT1720 is its robust mechanism of action: by pharmacologically activating SIRT1, it directly addresses multiple aspects of NASH pathophysiology, including mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative stress. The ability of SRT1720 to promote deacetylation of PGC-1α and subsequent upregulation of mitochondrial β-oxidation enzymes—such as CPT1A and MCAD—provides a rational basis for reducing intracellular lipid accumulation and restoring mitochondrial homeostasis (Chen, Lu, & Yang, 2025; Minor et al., 2011). In addition, the activation of antioxidant defenses via SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of factors like Nrf2 and FoxO1 contributes to lowering ROS levels and dampening inflammatory cascades that further exacerbate liver injury in NASH (Chen, Lu, & Yang, 2025; Minor et al., 2011).

From a therapeutic history standpoint, studies using SRT1720 have demonstrated an ability to reduce hepatic steatosis and improve mitochondrial function in high-fat diet models and acute liver injury paradigms (Minor et al., 2011; Farghali, Kemelo, & Canová, 2019). Although direct clinical evidence in NASH patients is lacking—as evidenced by negative findings in the registered clinical trial search—its preclinical success provides a compelling rationale for further investigation in this therapeutic area. This is further reinforced by comparative studies of other SIRT1 activators, such as resveratrol and natural polyphenols, that have shown benefits in reducing hepatic inflammation and improving metabolic profiles in NAFLD/NASH models (Nassir, 2020; Shi & Qi, 2023).

A notable strength of SRT1720 is its high potency and specificity for SIRT1 activation, with an EC₅₀ in the low micromolar range, which enables effective modulation of SIRT1 targets at relatively low doses. Additionally, its favorable pharmacokinetic profile in rodent models, which includes adequate liver exposure and a tolerable safety margin, further supports its potential for clinical development (Wan, 2021). The compound’s dual functionality in enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1α and mitigating oxidative stress through deacetylation of key transcription factors aligns well with the comprehensive therapeutic approach required for the multifactorial pathology of NASH.

However, several weaknesses and challenges remain. First, despite encouraging preclinical outcomes, clinical translation of SRT1720 has been hampered by a lack of human trial data specifically targeting NASH. Furthermore, discrepancies in bioavailability and long-term safety profiles between animal models and human subjects are potential hurdles that need to be addressed in subsequent studies. Another concern is that some earlier studies using SRT1720 have been conducted in models of acute liver injury or other metabolic diseases rather than chronic NASH, necessitating additional investigations in more specific and clinically relevant NASH models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, while the activation of SIRT1 is associated with multiple beneficial downstream effects, SIRT1 regulation is complex and tissue-specific, meaning off-target or dose-dependent adverse effects may limit its clinical applicability if not properly managed (Chen, Lu, & Yang, 2025).

In summary, SRT1720 exhibits a high degree of mechanistic plausibility for the treatment of NASH, primarily through its action as a SIRT1 activator that deacetylates PGC-1α and enhances mitochondrial β-oxidation while simultaneously bolstering antioxidant defenses. The preclinical data underscore its potential to reduce steatosis, lower oxidative stress, and improve hepatic mitochondrial function. Its synthetic origin allows for reproducible manufacturing and potential chemical optimization. However, the absence of clinical trial data in NASH-specific populations and the need for a better understanding of its long-term safety in humans are notable limitations. Overall, SRT1720 represents a promising drug candidate for repurposing in the treatment of NASH, and further targeted studies are warranted to validate its efficacy and safety in this indication (Minor et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2025; Farghali et al., 2019; Wan, 2021).

"ZLN005 (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #SML1555)","Proposal for ZLN005 (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #SML1555)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
ZLN005 is a synthetically produced small molecule, classified chemically as a benzodiazepine derivative with the molecular formula C17H18N2 and a molecular weight of 250.34. It was initially discovered and characterized as a transcriptional activator of the peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha (PGC1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism (Tohme et al., 2024). As a representative of the class of small molecules designed to modulate transcriptional coactivators, ZLN005 has been engineered to enhance the expression and activity of PGC1α, thereby stimulating mitochondrial gene expression cascades including those that regulate fatty acid oxidation (Miller et al., 2019). This compound is commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich (Cat. # SML1555) and belongs to a group of investigational molecules that have been primarily explored in the context of metabolic and ischemia-reperfusion injury models. The design principles underlying its synthesis are rooted in medicinal chemistry efforts to mimic the beneficial effects of exercise on mitochondrial function by upregulating endogenous mitochondrial regulators. In general, compounds of this class have been used in preclinical settings to investigate protective effects in organ systems vulnerable to metabolic stress, and they offer potential as metabolic enhancers due to their ability to induce mitochondrial biogenesis (Tohme et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
ZLN005’s therapeutic history is primarily found in preclinical research where its ability to upregulate PGC1α has been exploited to improve mitochondrial function in several experimental models. For example, studies in cardiac, renal, and neural tissues have explored its protective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury, revealing reductions in oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death together with an enhancement in mitochondrial mass (Tohme et al., 2024). In hepatic models, although data are more limited, ZLN005 has been shown to reduce liver triglycerides, diminish inflammatory markers, and enhance mitochondrial DNA content in rodent steatosis models. This aligns with a significant body of literature linking mitochondrial dysfunction to the progression of Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Its use in in vitro models such as HepG2 cell assays has also demonstrated an increase in PGC1α mRNA and protein levels, with concomitant rises in oxygen consumption and fatty acid oxidation enzyme expression (Mello et al., 2016). While there are currently no extensive clinical studies directly testing ZLN005 in NASH patients, an extensive clinical trial database search (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) suggests that molecules targeting PGC1α pathways are under active investigation, providing further impetus for repurposing ZLN005 toward the treatment of NASH (Tohme et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, ZLN005 acts as a transcriptional activator for PGC1α, which is central to the biogenesis and functional optimization of mitochondria. By elevating PGC1α mRNA and protein levels, it triggers a cascade of transcriptional events including the induction of nuclear respiratory factors (NRF1 and NRF2) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) that are necessary for the replication of mitochondrial DNA and the assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes (Tohme et al., 2024; Miller et al., 2019). Several studies have demonstrated that ZLN005 increases the mitochondrial DNA content and elevates oxygen consumption rates in cell models, supporting the notion that its action is mediated through enhanced mitochondrial oxidative capacity (Mello et al., 2016). Furthermore, mechanistic validation through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments has revealed increased binding of activated PGC1α to the promoters of genes encoding enzymes involved in β-oxidation. This directly implicates ZLN005 in the upregulation of fatty acid oxidation pathways—a critical aspect of improving metabolic dysfunction in hepatocytes with lipid overload (Tohme et al., 2024). Indirect activation via upstream kinases such as AMPK has been noted, although some time-dependent studies indicate that changes in phospho-AMPK levels may not be markedly significant at early time points, with the downstream TFAM promoter activity serving as a more sensitive readout of the drug’s effect (Moradi, 2022). In summary, the biochemical action of ZLN005 involves modulation of transcriptional networks governing mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid catabolism, processes that are fundamentally impaired in NASH (Miller et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
Given the central role of mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired fatty acid oxidation in the pathogenesis of NASH, the hypothesis that ZLN005 will enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and upregulate β-oxidation enzyme expression in hepatocytes is strongly supported by the preclinical literature. By increasing the transcriptional output of PGC1α, ZLN005 is expected to enhance the expression of key enzymes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, such as medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), and promote the overall mitochondrial oxidative capacity (Tohme et al., 2024). Improved mitochondrial biogenesis leads to an increased number of functional mitochondria, thereby elevating the cellular capacity to oxidize fatty acids. In turn, this will reduce hepatocellular lipid accumulation—a hallmark of NASH—and decrease the generation of lipotoxic intermediates that drive inflammatory signaling and fibrosis. Preclinical rodent studies have already demonstrated that treatment with ZLN005 correlates with decreased liver triglyceride levels and reduced markers of inflammation, suggesting that this compound effectively reverses lipid overload and its deleterious downstream effects on hepatic metabolism (Tohme et al., 2024; Mello et al., 2016). Moreover, the proposed mechanism is further validated by findings that indicate increased oxygen consumption and mitochondrial DNA content upon treatment in hepatocyte cell lines, thereby creating a strong rationale for improved fatty acid catabolism in NASH hepatocytes. The positive modulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular energy metabolism by ZLN005 also aligns with data obtained from exercise-induced adaptations in the liver, a known protective mechanism against NASH (Tohme et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
ZLN005 presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for NASH based on its well-characterized mechanism of action and the strong preclinical evidence supporting its ability to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. One of the primary strengths of this candidate is its clear mechanistic linkage via the activation of PGC1α, which is a critical node in mitochondrial and metabolic regulation. This compound not only induces PGC1α expression but also promotes the downstream transcription of mitochondrial genes and β-oxidation enzymes as supported by studies in both cell-based assays and rodent models (Mello et al., 2016; Tohme et al., 2024). Given that mitochondrial dysfunction is a central pathogenic factor in NASH, the ability of ZLN005 to potentially restore mitochondrial homeostasis is a significant asset. The molecule’s oral bioavailability further adds to its appeal as a drug candidate since this mode of delivery is advantageous in chronic diseases such as NASH.

However, there are also weaknesses that must be taken into account. First, while the preclinical data are compelling in models of steatosis and ischemia-reperfusion injury, there is currently a paucity of studies directly investigating the effects of ZLN005 in established NASH models. As a result, the translation of improvements in mitochondrial biogenesis to meaningful clinical outcomes in NASH patients remains to be confirmed. Second, the time-dependent effects on key upstream mediators like AMPK have shown some variability, suggesting that the timing and dosage of administration must be optimized to achieve the desired mitochondrial and metabolic responses (Moradi, 2022). Third, potential off-target effects and the long-term safety profile of ZLN005 in chronic administration have not yet been fully explored in vivo. Although the compound has demonstrated hepatoprotective effects in rodent models, comprehensive toxicology studies and phase I clinical trials would be necessary to firmly establish its safety profile prior to broader clinical testing in NASH.

Another consideration is the relative novelty of the compound’s application for NASH despite the well-established role of PGC1α in hepatic metabolism. While the rationale is robust, the lack of extensive human data specifically linking ZLN005 treatment to NASH improvement means that further preclinical validation in hepatic models, including studies using primary human hepatocytes and NASH-specific animal models, is required before definitive conclusions can be reached. In addition, the complexity of NASH pathogenesis—encompassing not just lipid metabolism but also inflammation, fibrosis, and insulin resistance—might necessitate combination therapies. ZLN005’s use as a monotherapy might therefore need to be carefully integrated into a broader treatment regimen or combined with other agents targeting complementary pathways.

In summary, the overall evaluation favors further development of ZLN005 as a potential repurposed drug candidate for NASH treatment. Its strengths include a compelling mechanism of action via PGC1α activation leading to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, increased β-oxidation enzyme expression, and consequent improvements in fatty acid catabolism and reduced lipid deposition—mechanistic outcomes that are highly relevant to the pathogenesis of NASH (Mello et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2019; Tohme et al., 2024). The challenges lie in addressing the current gaps in direct NASH-specific in vivo data, optimizing dosing strategies, and confirming long-term safety and efficacy. Given the current landscape of metabolic therapeutics and the ongoing clinical interest in targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in NASH (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), advancing ZLN005 into more rigorous preclinical studies is warranted, with an eventual aim to integrate it into clinical trials if the data continue to support its therapeutic potential.

Overall, ZLN005’s use as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for NASH is scientifically rational and supported by relevant preclinical data. However, the drug development team should prioritize generating additional mechanistic and in vivo efficacy data specifically in NASH models, while concurrently investigating the detailed pharmacokinetics and safety profile in long-term animal studies. These steps will substantiate whether the beneficial mitochondrial effects observed in other organs and in vitro systems can be extended to the complex pathophysiology of NASH, ultimately guiding the design of future clinical trials (Mello et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2019; Moradi, 2022; Tohme et al., 2024).

Elafibranor (Genfit),"Proposal for Elafibranor (Genfit)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Elafibranor is a fully synthetic small‐molecule drug discovered and developed by Genfit that specifically functions as a dual agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) alpha and delta (PPARα/δ). It belongs to the broader class of PPAR agonists, a group of nuclear receptor modulators that has been extensively explored for their ability to regulate lipid metabolism, inflammatory responses, and insulin sensitivity. The compound was designed using rational drug design and synthetic organic chemistry methodologies in order to achieve a balanced activation profile on both PPARα and PPARδ without engaging PPARγ receptors, thereby avoiding the adverse effects (such as weight gain and edema) commonly encountered with thiazolidinedione drugs that selectively activate PPARγ (Choudhary et al., 2019). Its synthetic origin allows for precise modulation of its physicochemical properties, ensuring optimal oral bioavailability and metabolic stability, and this design strategy is consistent with other newly developed PPAR agonists used for metabolic and inflammatory disorders. This class of compounds has previously been deployed in the treatment of dyslipidemia with fibrates (which are PPARα agonists) and, more recently, in the management of metabolic syndrome; however, the dual PPARα/δ profile of elafibranor represents a novel approach intended to address the multifactorial metabolic perturbations observed in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, PPAR agonists have been evaluated in both preclinical and clinical settings for their ability to improve lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and inflammatory markers, and these effects have proven useful in diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. Elafibranor, in particular, has been the subject of multiple clinical trials for the treatment of NASH. In early-phase studies—for example, the Phase IIb GOLDEN-505 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2012)—elafibranor demonstrated the potential to induce resolution of NASH without worsening fibrosis in a subset of patients, with improvements noted in serum liver enzyme levels (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) and reductions in inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) (Boeckmans et al., 2019; Choudhary et al., 2019). Preclinical studies in rodent models of NASH have consistently shown that dual activation of PPARα and PPARδ by elafibranor leads to improved mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta-oxidation, resulting in reduced hepatocellular lipid accumulation and lower expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Perakakis et al., 2021; Todisco et al., 2022). Although encouraging signals were observed in these studies, subsequent large-scale Phase III trials (for example, NCT02704403; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016) failed to meet their primary endpoints for histological improvement, which led to a re-evaluation of the clinical potential of elafibranor in NASH (Mantovani, Byrne, & Targher, 2022; Nathani, 2023). Beyond NASH, PPAR agonists have been successfully repurposed for other metabolic disorders such as primary biliary cholangitis as evidenced by later developments; however, the evidence for elafibranor in NASH specifically remains mixed, despite promising early biochemical and histological responses (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Oseini & Sanyal, 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
Elafibranor exerts its therapeutic effect through dual agonism of PPARα and PPARδ, which are ligand-activated transcription factors predominantly expressed in the liver and other metabolically active tissues. The activation of PPARα is critical for the transcriptional upregulation of genes involved in peroxisomal beta-oxidation and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, such as acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), both of which contribute to increased catabolism of fatty acids and reduced hepatic lipid accumulation (Choudhary et al., 2019; Todisco et al., 2022). Concurrently, PPARδ activation enhances fatty acid oxidation in peripheral tissues, improves insulin sensitivity, and exerts anti-inflammatory effects through modulation of macrophage function and cytokine production (Zheng et al., 2023; Todisco et al., 2022). Mechanistic studies, including coactivator recruitment assays, have confirmed direct target engagement by elafibranor, triggering recruitment of transcriptional coactivators that further amplify the expression of downstream genes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), a regulator of gluconeogenesis and energy balance, thereby contributing to metabolic homeostasis (Perakakis et al., 2021; Choudhary et al., 2019). This coordinated activation results in a synergistic upregulation of mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, reduction in lipotoxic intermediates, and consequent attenuation of pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic signaling pathways implicated in NASH progression (Mantovani & Targher, 2022; Nathani, 2023). In addition, elafibranor’s receptor activation modulates key signaling networks that influence immune cell recruitment and cytokine release; for example, reducing the expression of IL-6 and CCL2, thereby mitigating inflammatory cascades in the liver microenvironment (Boeckmans et al., 2019). At the molecular level, the effective receptor binding (with EC₅₀ values of approximately 0.45 µM for PPARα and 1.3 µM for PPARδ) ensures that elafibranor robustly engages its targets at clinically achievable concentrations, reinforcing its capacity to modulate gene networks central to lipid oxidation and inflammatory resolution (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Choudhary et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
Based on preclinical data and early clinical trials, the expected effect of elafibranor in NASH is multifactorial. The primary anticipated outcome is a reduction in hepatocellular lipid load due to enhanced mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta-oxidation, facilitated by the upregulation of genes such as ACOX1, CPT1A, and PDK4. In vitro and in vivo models repeatedly demonstrate that activation of PPARα increases fatty acid oxidation and reduces steatosis in hepatocytes, while PPARδ’s action in peripheral tissues helps to ameliorate systemic insulin resistance and improve overall metabolic profiles (Perakakis et al., 2021; Todisco et al., 2022). In clinical assays, this mechanistic profile translates into reduced circulating levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST) and inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP), which are considered surrogate biomarkers of liver injury and inflammation in NASH patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2012; Boeckmans et al., 2019). Moreover, the resolution of histological features of NASH—namely steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning—has been observed in post hoc analyses, suggesting that elafibranor’s dual receptor activation may facilitate not only lipid lowering but also an improvement in the inflammatory microenvironment that drives cryptogenic fibrosis progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Mantovani & Targher, 2022). Given that hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells express relevant PPAR isoforms, elafibranor is expected to act on these cell types to reduce inflammatory signaling and potentially slow the fibrogenic cascade that leads to cirrhosis (Tacke & Weiskirchen, 2021; Boeckmans et al., 2019). Thus, the anticipated impact is a comprehensive improvement in liver histology and metabolic parameters, culminating in a decreased risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with NASH.

Overall Evaluation:
Elafibranor represents a conceptually robust therapeutic candidate for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, given its well-defined dual mechanism of action that targets both lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways (Choudhary et al., 2019; Todisco et al., 2022). One of the primary strengths of elafibranor lies in its dual PPARα/δ agonism, which is designed to simultaneously enhance hepatic fatty acid oxidation and improve systemic insulin sensitivity while also dampening inflammatory responses. This multifaceted activity addresses the complex pathophysiology of NASH where lipotoxicity, metabolic dysregulation, and chronic inflammation interconnect to drive disease progression (Choudhary et al., 2019; Todisco et al., 2022). The drug’s synthetic origin and selective receptor activation have enabled the development of an agent with desirable pharmacokinetic properties that support once-daily, oral administration—a key advantage in chronic diseases that require long-term management (Ahmed et al., 2024; Oseini & Sanyal, 2017).

From a historical perspective, early-phase clinical studies of elafibranor have shown promising biochemical improvements, including reductions in serum liver enzymes, inflammatory markers, and some degree of histological resolution of NASH features. These results come alongside supportive preclinical data in rodent models where dual activation of PPARα and PPARδ led to marked improvements in steatosis, decreased inflammatory cytokine profiles, and enhanced fatty acid oxidation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Perakakis et al., 2021; Todisco et al., 2022). However, a major challenge that has emerged in the clinical development of elafibranor is the inconsistency of its efficacy in larger pivotal Phase III trials, where the drug failed to meet the primary endpoint of NASH resolution without worsening fibrosis. This disparity between early promising data and later clinical outcomes suggests that while the underlying biochemical and molecular rationale is sound, the translational challenges inherent to the heterogeneous human NASH population may dilute the measurable clinical benefits (Mantovani & Targher, 2022; Nathani, 2023). Variability in patient selection, differences in disease stage (e.g., advanced fibrosis versus early steatosis), and the multifactorial drivers of NASH pathogenesis contribute to these challenges. Additionally, while elafibranor has a favorable safety profile with few PPARγ-related side effects, its modest efficacy when compared to approved treatments in other metabolic conditions remains a notable weakness (Boeckmans et al., 2019; Oseini & Sanyal, 2017).

Another consideration is the degree by which elafibranor modulates gene expression related to mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation. Functional studies demonstrating upregulation of markers like ACOX1, CPT1A, and PDK4 support the hypothesis that elafibranor improves fatty acid oxidation and overall energy homeostasis in hepatocytes. This molecular evidence, derived from both in vitro coactivator recruitment assays and animal models of NASH, underlines the mechanistic specificity of elafibranor’s action (Perakakis et al., 2021; Choudhary et al., 2019). Yet, despite this mechanistic precision, the extent of clinical efficacy necessary to induce meaningful histological reversal of NASH—especially in regard to fibrosis regression—remains to be conclusively demonstrated in large-scale trials.

In summary, elafibranor’s key strengths include its rational dual PPARα/δ targeting, a mechanism that is well supported by molecular and preclinical studies, and its favorable pharmacological profile that allows for convenient oral dosing and a low incidence of classical adverse effects associated with other PPAR modulators. Weaknesses that temper its promise include the mixed clinical trial outcomes, particularly regarding endpoints such as fibrosis improvement and overall NASH resolution, as well as the inherent challenges in translating improvements in metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers into consistent histological benefits across a diverse patient population. Therefore, while the mechanistic specificity and translational tractability of elafibranor are compelling—especially in light of its ability to modulate mitochondrial and peroxisomal gene expression and reduce hepatocellular lipid load—the overall clinical potential of elafibranor in NASH remains under question. Further studies may be needed to refine patient selection, optimize dosing regimens, and potentially explore combination therapies that can synergize with elafibranor’s biological effects to achieve robust, long-term clinical outcomes in NASH (Mantovani & Targher, 2022; Nathani, 2023; Boeckmans et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
In conclusion, as a candidate for repurposing in NASH, elafibranor offers a theoretically attractive intervention based on its dual receptor agonism mechanism, which enables simultaneous improvement in fatty acid oxidation and attenuation of inflammatory signaling. Its synthetic origin and design allow for a balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ, leading to expected beneficial effects such as reduced hepatic steatosis, improved mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta-oxidation, and a consequential decrease in the pro-inflammatory environment that drives fibrosis in steatohepatitis. However, the clinical history of elafibranor reflects a common challenge in metabolic drug development: the promising preclinical and early-phase clinical results have not consistently translated into robust histological improvements in later stage, larger-scale trials. Thus, while the mechanistic rationale is sound, further optimization—either as a monotherapy in well-characterized patient subgroups or in conjunction with other agents targeting complementary pathways—may be necessary to fully capitalize on its potential (Choudhary et al., 2019; Mantovani, Byrne, & Targher, 2022; Nathani, 2023).

Taking into account these factors, our team should consider continued preclinical investigations and carefully designed smaller-scale clinical studies aiming to better define the responsive patient population and to further elucidate dosing strategies that maximize efficacy while minimizing potential adverse effects. While elafibranor shows considerable promise from a mechanistic and biochemical standpoint, its clinical development trajectory underscores the need for additional work to convincingly demonstrate its capacity to not only modulate metabolic biomarkers but also to achieve meaningful and sustained histological improvements in NASH. This analysis supports a measured optimism for elafibranor as a promising therapeutic candidate for NASH with the potential for repurposing, though further evidence is required to justify large-scale investment in its development for this indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Boeckmans et al., 2019; Todisco et al., 2022).

────────────────────────────────────────
Overview of Therapeutic Candidate

C75 is a synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor that was originally designed to overcome the shortcomings of natural FAS inhibitors. Its development stemmed from early observations with cerulenin, a natural antibiotic isolated from the fungus Cephalosporium caerulens that was found to inhibit FAS by covalently binding to its active site, specifically targeting the β‐ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain (Alwarawrah, 2016). Cerulenin’s clinical utility was hampered by its instability, primarily due to the presence of a reactive epoxy group that led to non‐specific interactions and chemical lability. To address these issues, medicinal chemists modified the core α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone scaffold of cerulenin to yield C75, which lacks the reactive epoxide. This modification significantly improved the chemical stability and pharmacologic reproducibility of the compound while preserving its ability to inhibit FAS (Kuhajda et al., 2000).

Belonging to a class of synthetic FAS inhibitors, C75 acts predominantly by interacting with critical catalytic domains of the FAS enzyme complex. Although its primary binding is localized at the KS domain, there is evidence suggesting that other domains, such as the thioesterase (TE) domain, may also be affected in some cellular contexts (Kuhajda et al., 2000). This class of compounds has historically served as valuable research tools for dissecting the role of de novo lipogenesis in both cancer and metabolic diseases. In preclinical models, FAS inhibitors have been used extensively to demonstrate that cells with high rates of lipogenesis—such as certain cancer cell types and hepatocytes in metabolic disease—are particularly vulnerable to interference in fatty acid synthesis (Alwarawrah, 2016; Ashworth, 2017). The structural rationale that led to the synthesis of C75 exemplifies how rational drug design can transform a natural product lead into a more clinically viable molecule by eliminating reactive moieties and improving stability.

Furthermore, the chemical series to which C75 belongs has been studied across a range of biomedical applications. In cancer biology, FAS inhibitors have been used to explore the role of lipogenesis in supporting rapid cell proliferation. In metabolic studies, these inhibitors have been investigated for their potential to reduce lipogenic flux and decrease lipid accumulation in tissues such as the liver. This dual applicability underscores the broader utility of FAS inhibitors as both mechanistic probes and potential therapeutic agents (Ashworth, 2017).

────────────────────────────────────────
Therapeutic History

The therapeutic history of C75 is best understood against the backdrop of two main fields of investigation: oncology and metabolic disorders. Initially, inhibitors of FAS like cerulenin were used in cancer research due to the observation that many aggressive cancers—including breast, prostate, and ovarian tumors—overexpress FAS. In these settings, high de novo lipogenesis supports rapid membrane synthesis and energy production, making FAS an attractive target. However, the inherent instability and broad reactivity of natural inhibitors limited their use. C75 was therefore developed as a more stable, synthetic derivative to retain the beneficial inhibitory effects on FAS without the liabilities of cerulenin (Kuhajda et al., 2000; Pandey et al., 2012).

In oncology, numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated that treatment with C75 reduces fatty acid synthesis, ultimately leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells. For example, in human cancer cell line studies, C75 was shown to preferentially bind to FAS, leading to a reduction in lipid biosynthesis that is critical for tumor growth (Kuhajda et al., 2000). Xenograft models further supported these findings, with C75 administration resulting in significant tumor growth inhibition while sparing non-malignant tissues such as the bone marrow and gastrointestinal epithelium.

Beyond its use in cancer, the metabolic properties of C75 have been explored in animal models of obesity and related metabolic dysfunctions. In rodent studies, C75 administration has been observed to trigger marked weight loss, improve glycemic control, and reduce hepatic steatosis. Its effects on reducing fat mass were linked to its ability to inhibit de novo lipogenesis, which in turn modulated energy storage and altered systemic lipid metabolism (Kuhajda, 2006; Batchuluun et al., 2022). However, it is important to note that while these supportive studies in obesity and cancer provide a strong mechanistic rationale, direct evaluations of C75 for treating liver‐specific pathologies such as NASH remain limited. Most evidence for its potential in NASH has been extrapolated from its effects on lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and rodent models of hepatic steatosis (Ashworth, 2017; Batchuluun et al., 2022).

In summary, the preclinical history of C75 includes robust evidence in oncology and metabolic research that underscores its capacity to inhibit FAS and reduce lipogenesis. Despite promising data in these areas, the translation of C75 into clinical trials for metabolic liver disease—specifically, non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)—has not advanced significantly. Instead, later‐generation FAS inhibitors (e.g., TVB-2640) have moved forward into clinical studies for liver diseases, suggesting that while C75 remains a valuable proof‐of‐concept tool, its role in clinical development for NASH is more exploratory at this stage (Batchuluun et al., 2022).

────────────────────────────────────────
Mechanism of Action

At the molecular level, C75 exerts its biological effects by targeting fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme responsible for the de novo synthesis of long‐chain fatty acids from acetyl‐CoA and malonyl‐CoA. FAS is a multifunctional protein complex composed of several enzymatic domains including the β‐ketoacyl synthase (KS), enoyl reductase (ER), and thioesterase (TE) domains. Biochemical studies have shown that C75 predominantly interacts with the KS domain, thereby inhibiting the condensation reaction that is vital for fatty acid chain elongation (Kuhajda et al., 2000; Wu & Zhang, 2010).

Under normal metabolic conditions, malonyl‐CoA serves a dual role in hepatocytes. On one hand, it is the critical substrate for FAS in the lipogenic pathway; on the other, it acts as a potent inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), the enzyme that regulates the transport of long‐chain fatty acyl‐CoAs into mitochondria for β‐oxidation. In a situation of high FAS activity, malonyl‐CoA is rapidly consumed, thereby relieving its inhibition on CPT1 and promoting fatty acid oxidation. Conversely, when FAS is robustly inhibited by a compound like C75, there tends to be an accumulation of malonyl‐CoA which would normally further inhibit CPT1. It is within this context that a paradox arises: despite the expectation of malonyl‐CoA accumulation, some experimental systems have reported increased fatty acid oxidation following C75 treatment, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms may be acting either to re‐balance malonyl‐CoA pools or to modulate CPT1 activity directly (Alwarawrah, 2016; Miller, 2014).

One explanation for this counterintuitive effect is that the inhibition of de novo fatty acid synthesis itself may trigger a compensatory activation of fatty acid oxidation pathways. In certain models, C75 treatment has been shown to result in enhanced CPT1 activity and increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation rates despite the potential buildup of malonyl‐CoA. This may be due to alterations in the subcellular compartmentalization of malonyl‐CoA or feedback loops that fine‐tune the activity of CPT1 in response to changing lipid fluxes (Miller, 2014; Wang et al., 2012).

In addition to its primary action at the KS domain, there is evidence that C75 might also interact with other catalytic domains of FAS, such as the TE domain. Dual targeting of multiple steps in the fatty acid synthesis pathway could amplify the inhibitory effect on lipogenesis, further reducing the cellular production of fatty acids like palmitate, which is essential for triglyceride synthesis and membrane formation (Kuhajda et al., 2000).

The interplay between FAS inhibition and CPT1 modulation is central to the therapeutic hypothesis for NASH. In NASH, hepatocytes exhibit an upregulation of FAS, which contributes to excessive accumulation of fatty acids and triglycerides. This overproduction of malonyl‐CoA not only drives steatosis but also exacerbates the inhibition of CPT1, leading to impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. By inhibiting FAS, C75 is expected to decrease the production of new fatty acids, thereby reducing the consumption of malonyl‐CoA. In an ideal scenario, such an intervention would decrease hepatic triglyceride accumulation and possibly allow for a rebalancing of malonyl‐CoA concentrations that could then relieve the inhibition on CPT1. The net effect would be an increase in mitochondrial fatty acid β‐oxidation, helping to clear accumulated lipids in the liver (Pandey et al., 2012; Wu & Zhang, 2010).

Thus, the molecular action of C75 can be summarized as follows:
 1. Direct binding to the KS domain of FAS, inhibiting the conversion of malonyl‐CoA and acetyl‐CoA into long‐chain fatty acids.
 2. Potential secondary effects on other FAS domains, such as the TE domain, which further suppress de novo lipogenesis.
 3. Modulation of intracellular malonyl‐CoA levels and, through potential feedback or compartmentalization effects, a reduction in the inhibitory tone on CPT1.
 4. An overall shift in the cellular lipid balance, from enhanced fatty acid synthesis toward increased mitochondrial β‐oxidation (Alwarawrah, 2016; Wu & Zhang, 2010).

────────────────────────────────────────
Expected Effect in a NASH Context

The central hypothesis for repurposing C75 in NASH treatment is based on the notion that inhibiting de novo lipogenesis will reduce hepatic triglyceride accumulation. In non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, excessive fatty acid synthesis is a driving factor behind steatosis, which over time leads to inflammation, fibrosis, and progressive liver injury. By specifically targeting FAS, C75 is expected to impede the conversion of acetyl‐CoA and malonyl‐CoA into palmitate and other fatty acids that form the building blocks of triglycerides. This should result in a significant drop in the substrate availability needed for triglyceride deposition in hepatocytes (Ashworth, 2017).

In hepatocyte cell systems—such as those using HepG2 cells or primary human hepatocytes—the inhibition of FAS by C75 should lead to a measurable decrease in the formation of lipid droplets. These cells normally respond to elevated de novo lipogenesis by increasing the expression of lipogenic genes such as FASN; therefore, a reduction in lipogenesis via FAS inhibition is expected to be accompanied by lower intracellular fatty acid levels (Ashworth, 2017). Biochemical assays in these systems would likely reveal decreased incorporation of radiolabeled precursors into lipids, reflecting a robust suppression of fatty acid synthesis.

An important element in the expected mechanism is the modulation of malonyl‐CoA levels. In the context of NASH, high malonyl‐CoA not only drives fatty acid synthesis but also suppresses CPT1, thereby reducing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The classical view is that inhibition of FAS should lead directly to an accumulation of malonyl‐CoA; however, several studies have indicated that C75 treatment can result in an overall metabolic shift favoring fatty acid oxidation. This could occur via two non‐mutually exclusive mechanisms. First, a decrease in fatty acid synthesis may lower the overall demand for malonyl‐CoA, thereby altering its steady‐state levels or its subcellular partitioning. Second, there may be a compensatory upregulation or activation of CPT1 in response to decreased lipogenesis, enhancing the mitochondrial uptake and oxidation of fatty acids (Wu & Zhang, 2010; Batchuluun et al., 2022).

In rodent models where hepatic steatosis is induced either by dietary manipulation or genetic modification, administration of C75 has been shown to reduce the liver’s lipid burden. The expected outcomes in these models include a decrease in liver weight, reduced deposition of lipid droplets, and lower levels of serum markers indicative of liver injury (such as ALT and AST). Additionally, improvements in systemic metabolic parameters—such as blood glucose and insulin sensitivity—have been documented, which may further contribute to the overall improvement in liver histology and function (Kuhajda, 2006; Batchuluun et al., 2022).

Given that hepatocytes express high levels of FAS in NASH, the target of C75 is directly relevant to the diseased cells. The anticipated reduction in de novo lipogenesis should, in theory, alleviate the lipotoxic stress that drives both inflammatory and fibrotic responses in the liver. In addition to decreasing triglyceride synthesis, the metabolic rebalancing toward increased β‐oxidation could lead to lower levels of toxic lipid intermediates, further mitigating cellular stress and preventing progression from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis.

It is noteworthy, however, that the interplay between malonyl‐CoA dynamics and CPT1 activity is complex. Although C75 is expected to relieve CPT1 inhibition indirectly through its effects on FAS, some experimental findings have suggested that acute administration may also lead to direct or indirect changes in CPT1 activity. The net effect would be a shift in the balance from storage (lipogenesis) to oxidation (β‐oxidation), ultimately reducing the accumulation of hepatic triglycerides (Miller, 2014; Wang et al., 2012).

Thus, in a NASH context, the expected effects of C75 include:
 • A significant reduction in the de novo synthesis of fatty acids in hepatocytes.
 • Lower intracellular levels of palmitate, resulting in decreased triglyceride synthesis.
 • A rebalancing of malonyl‐CoA dynamics that permits enhanced CPT1 activity and mitochondrial β‐oxidation.
 • Measurable improvements in liver histology, including reduced steatosis and potentially alleviated inflammation and fibrosis.
These outcomes would collectively address the core metabolic imbalance underlying NASH (Ashworth, 2017; Batchuluun et al., 2022).

────────────────────────────────────────
Overall Evaluation

In our overall evaluation of C75 as a candidate for the treatment of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis, several key points emerge regarding both its promise and its limitations.

On the positive side, the mechanistic rationale for targeting FAS in NASH is strong. C75 is a rationally designed molecule that effectively inhibits de novo lipogenesis by binding to the KS domain of FAS. This targeted action not only reduces the formation of fatty acids required for triglyceride synthesis but also has the potential to modulate the malonyl‐CoA–CPT1 axis that is deranged in NASH. Preclinical studies in cancer and metabolic disease models have demonstrated that C75 can decrease lipid synthesis, reduce hepatic steatosis, and improve systemic metabolic parameters such as blood glucose and insulin sensitivity (Kuhajda et al., 2000; Miller, 2014).

In rodent models, C75 has produced compelling evidence of reduced liver fat accumulation and improved markers of liver injury. These observations suggest that, if the drug’s dosing can be carefully managed to achieve sufficient hepatic exposure while minimizing off‐target effects, it has the potential to reverse at least some of the pathological features of NASH. In hepatocyte‐based assays, inhibition of FAS by C75 is expected to lower intracellular triglyceride levels through a dual mechanism involving both a reduction in substrate production (via decreased palmitate synthesis) and a shift toward increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (Ashworth, 2017; Pandey et al., 2012).

Notwithstanding these strengths, several significant drawbacks are evident:
 • One major concern is the systemic effect of C75 on appetite and energy balance. In multiple rodent studies, repeated administration of C75 has been linked to pronounced anorexia and weight loss. These systemic side effects are believed to arise, at least in part, from central nervous system actions where FAS inhibition alters hypothalamic signaling pathways (Miller, 2014; Wang et al., 2012). For patients with NASH—many of whom already face nutritional and metabolic challenges—such adverse effects could be detrimental.
 • Although C75 has been studied extensively in cancer and obesity models, there is a dearth of direct clinical or preclinical evidence of its efficacy in NASH. Much of the supportive data in a liver context have been extrapolated from studies in rodent models of hepatic steatosis or from in vitro assays in hepatocytes. In contrast, later‐generation compounds with enhanced selectivity and improved pharmacokinetic properties (such as TVB‐2640) have advanced further in clinical development for NASH (Batchuluun et al., 2022; Ashworth, 2017).
 • The interplay between FAS inhibition and CPT1 activation is complex and not fully understood. Some studies have suggested that while inhibition of FAS by C75 would theoretically lead to an accumulation of malonyl‐CoA and further dampen CPT1 activity, compensatory mechanisms might instead lead to an overshoot in CPT1‐mediated fatty acid oxidation. Such an imbalance could possibly induce oxidative stress and hepatocellular injury if not carefully titrated (Wu & Zhang, 2010; Wu, 2023).
 • Finally, issues related to species differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of C75 may hinder its translation from preclinical models to human therapy. Variability in the expression of FAS, differences in central regulation of appetite, and divergent metabolic responses between rodents and humans all contribute to uncertainty regarding the clinical efficacy and safety profile of C75 (Batchuluun et al., 2022; Ashworth, 2017).

Given the multifactorial nature of NASH – where steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis are intertwined – a medication that solely targets de novo lipogenesis may not be enough to fully reverse the disease process. Combination therapy or the development of next‐generation FAS inhibitors with more favorable safety profiles might be necessary for meaningful clinical benefits. Nonetheless, C75 provides an important proof‐of‐concept by clearly demonstrating that the FAS–malonyl‐CoA–CPT1 axis is a viable target for modulating hepatic lipid metabolism (Alwarawrah, 2016; Pandey et al., 2012).

────────────────────────────────────────
Final Recommendation and Future Directions

In summary, C75 offers a compelling mechanistic rationale for the treatment of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis by directly targeting fatty acid synthase and potentially restoring the balance between lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. The compound’s design as a synthetic FAS inhibitor – derived from natural product leads and optimized for stability – makes it a valuable tool for investigating the therapeutic modulation of the FAS–malonyl‐CoA–CPT1 axis (Kuhajda et al., 2000; Alwarawrah, 2016).

However, significant challenges exist. The pronounced systemic effects, particularly anorexia and weight loss observed in rodent models, may limit its utility in chronic conditions like NASH where preservation of nutritional status is critical. Moreover, the available data in liver disease models are less extensive than in oncologic or obesity settings, necessitating further rigorous preclinical evaluation focused on hepatic endpoints.

Future research strategies should consider:
 • Refining dosing regimens and exploring targeted delivery systems (for example, hepatocyte‐specific formulations) to concentrate the action of C75 within the liver while minimizing central side effects.
 • Conducting systematic dose–response studies in advanced animal models of NASH to monitor not only steatosis but also inflammation, fibrosis, and the possible development of oxidative stress due to altered CPT1 activity.
 • Investigating the detailed kinetics of malonyl‐CoA and CPT1 in hepatocytes following C75 treatment to better understand the compensatory metabolic responses and ensure that the promotion of β‐oxidation does not cause secondary injury.
 • Comparing the efficacy and safety profile of C75 with later‐generation FAS inhibitors that are currently undergoing clinical evaluation for NASH, such as TVB‐2640, to ascertain whether modifications to the chemical structure or delivery mode might yield a superior therapeutic candidate.

Overall, while C75 remains a valuable investigational tool that strongly validates the therapeutic concept of modulating de novo lipogenesis in NASH, its current safety concerns and systemic side effects present significant hurdles for clinical translation as a monotherapy. It may serve best as a lead compound for further optimization or as part of a combination strategy aimed at addressing both metabolic dysregulation and inflammatory/fibrotic pathways in the liver (Batchuluun et al., 2022; Wu, 2023).

Based on the current literature, our recommendation is that further preclinical efforts be directed toward either modifying the structure of C75 – to reduce central nervous system penetration and off‐target anorectic effects – or developing novel analogs that retain the beneficial FAS inhibitory action while exhibiting a more favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile. In parallel, robust comparative studies should be initiated to benchmark C75’s efficacy and toxicity against other emerging FAS inhibitors in advanced NASH models.

In conclusion, while C75 demonstrates a mechanistically attractive approach via inhibition of FAS and potential relief of malonyl‐CoA–mediated inhibition on CPT1, its current profile as a standalone therapeutic agent for NASH is limited by systemic adverse effects and an incomplete understanding of its metabolic impacts in human‐relevant models. Thus, C75 is best regarded at this stage as a powerful proof‐of‐concept molecule that has contributed significantly to our understanding of the FAS–malonyl‐CoA–CPT1 axis, yet will require additional refinement or combination with other therapeutic strategies for successful clinical application in NASH (Ashworth, 2017; Pandey et al., 2012).

────────────────────────────────────────
Closing Remarks

The repurposing of C75 for non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis is founded on a logically sound mechanistic approach. By targeting fatty acid synthase – an enzyme upregulated in NASH and critical for excessive lipid accumulation – C75 works to restore the balance between lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Despite its promising biochemical and preclinical profile, the transition from laboratory success to clinical efficacy is challenged by significant side effects, notably weight loss and potential exacerbation of metabolic imbalance if CPT1 activation is not properly controlled.

Moving forward, a concerted effort to optimize the delivery and chemical properties of C75, possibly through targeted drug development or formulation strategies, is required. Only with such modifications can we ensure that the benefits of modulating the FAS–malonyl‐CoA–CPT1 axis are harnessed in a safe and efficacious manner for patients suffering from NASH.

In summary, while C75 represents a compelling scientific tool and a promising starting point for therapeutic intervention in NASH, its current utilization is best limited to proof‐of‐concept studies. Future directions should prioritize structural refinement, targeted delivery, and robust, comparative preclinical evaluation to ultimately develop a viable therapeutic agent for the complex pathophysiology of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis.

"XCT790 (Tocris Bioscience, Cat. #4392)","Proposal for XCT790 (Tocris Bioscience, Cat. #4392)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
XCT790 is a small‐molecule synthetic compound initially characterized as an inverse agonist of estrogen‐related receptor alpha (ERRα). It was chemically developed and is commercially available (Tocris Bioscience, Cat. #4392) as a pharmacological tool designed to selectively bind the ligand‐binding domain of ERRα and reduce its constitutive transcriptional activity. As a member of the nuclear receptor modulator class, XCT790 belongs to therapeutic candidates that modulate transcriptional regulators involved in energy metabolism. Compounds in this class have been used extensively in preclinical studies to dissect the roles of orphan nuclear receptors in metabolism and cancer biology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The design strategy for such modulators typically relies on synthetic methods that optimize binding affinity and selectivity while providing a means to “reverse” the receptor’s basal activity via inverse agonism.

Therapeutic History:
Biochemically, ERRα is well established as a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) through its transcriptional control of several mitochondrial and metabolic genes. In numerous preclinical studies, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of ERRα using inverse agonists such as XCT790 and structurally related compounds (e.g., C29) has been employed to probe the downstream effects of reduced ERRα activity in hepatocytes and other metabolic tissues ( “Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.). ERRα inverse agonists have been used in laboratory experiments to modulate hepatic very‐low‐density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, intracellular triglyceride handling, and lipid droplet formation in mouse hepatocytes (“Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.). Despite extensive use in vitro and in rodent models of metabolic syndrome, there is limited evidence of prior clinical or veterinary application of XCT790 specifically for non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or even non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Several clinical trials in related metabolic contexts have been initiated using ERRα‐targeted strategies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), yet direct therapeutic use of XCT790 in patients remains largely investigational and confined to experimental settings. In models of NAFLD/NASH, evidence from similar compounds indicates that inverse agonism of ERRα may lead to reduced hepatic VLDL secretion and paradoxically worsen lipid accumulation, suggesting that the historical experience with this drug class in hepatic disease is mixed and may counter conventional expectations (“Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.; Yang et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
XCT790 exerts its pharmacological effects by binding to the ligand‐binding domain of ERRα and stabilizing a conformation that favors corepressor recruitment over coactivator engagement. Under normal circumstances, ERRα cooperates with coactivators such as PGC1α to drive the transcription of genes critical for mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g., genes encoding components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain) and fatty acid oxidation enzymes such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) (Xia, Dufour, & Giguère, 2019). Inhibition by XCT790 is expected to diminish the receptor’s transcriptional output, resulting in decreased expression of these metabolic genes. However, the mechanistic literature reveals that ERRα is not a repressor of mitochondrial biogenesis—in fact, ERRα typically promotes mitochondrial oxidative capacity, enhances β‐oxidation, and supports lipid export via VLDL secretion (Yang et al., 2020). Experimental evidence in hepatocytes has shown that loss of ERRα activity, whether by genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition with inverse agonists such as XCT790 and C29, is associated with reduced expression of key lipid handling genes (e.g., Apob, Mttp, Pla2g12b) and may impair mitochondrial biogenesis indirectly via lower PGC1α activity (“Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.). On the other hand, some reports suggest that in rodent metabolic syndrome models, inhibition of ERRα may reduce hepatic triglyceride levels and improve insulin sensitivity by modifying VLDL secretion (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Despite these observations, detailed binding assays consistently confirm that XCT790 binds selectively to ERRα, thereby modulating the nuclear receptor’s ability to initiate transcription of genes involved in mitochondrial function and FAO (Tripathi & Reddemma Sandireddy, 2021). The net effect of XCT790, however, appears to be context dependent, with some studies indicating that inverse agonism further diminishes mitochondrial function rather than relieving repression—a finding that contrasts with the original hypothesis.

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis posits that by inhibiting ERRα with XCT790, the drug will relieve ERRα‐mediated repression of mitochondrial biogenesis and FAO gene expression in NASH hepatocytes. Specifically, it is anticipated that treatment with XCT790 in hepatocyte cultures will lead to enhanced expression of PGC1α and CPT1A, thereby boosting mitochondrial content and β‐oxidation capacity, which in turn should decrease intracellular hepatic triglyceride accumulation and improve insulin sensitivity. This expected effect is grounded in the idea that ERRα is a negative regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and that its inhibition will upregulate pathways involved in oxidative metabolism. However, consistent biochemical and in vivo studies have demonstrated that ERRα normally acts to positively regulate genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (Xia, Dufour, & Giguère, 2019; Audet‐Walsh & Giguère, 2015). Furthermore, in several rodent models, inhibition of ERRα with inverse agonists has been associated with decreased VLDL secretion and increased hepatic lipid accumulation, exacerbating NAFLD/NASH phenotypes rather than alleviating them (“Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.; Yang et al., 2020). Consequently, while the proposed assay may show changes in gene expression, the direction of the effect may not be beneficial when evaluated in the context of an already compromised mitochondrial function in NASH hepatocytes. The expected molecular outcome—that XCT790 increases mitochondrial content and β‐oxidation capacity by upregulating PGC1α and CPT1A—remains speculative given that robust preclinical evidence supports the role of ERRα in maintaining normal mitochondrial function (Tripathi & Reddemma Sandireddy, 2021; “Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
The evaluation of XCT790 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis yields mixed and, in some respects, contradictory evidence. On the one hand, XCT790 is a well‐characterized ERRα inverse agonist with robust target engagement and established use in mechanistic studies; its selectivity and potency in binding ERRα are advantageous for investigating nuclear receptor modulation in metabolic diseases (Tripathi & Reddemma Sandireddy, 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The compound has been shown to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism by affecting genes involved in VLDL secretion and intracellular triglyceride handling. Moreover, some rodent studies suggest that modulation of ERRα activity can alter insulin sensitivity and hepatic lipid profiles.

However, the fundamental weakness in the candidate’s therapeutic logic arises from the established physiological role of ERRα in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. ERRα generally functions as a positive regulator of mitochondrial gene expression—promoting oxidative phosphorylation, enhancing PGC1α expression, and ensuring efficient β‐oxidation (Xia, Dufour, & Giguère, 2019; Yang et al., 2020). Inhibition of ERRα using inverse agonists such as XCT790 has repeatedly been shown to diminish these beneficial processes, leading to reduced VLDL secretion and increased hepatic lipid accumulation, which are adverse outcomes in the context of NASH (“Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.). Furthermore, the mechanistic premise that XCT790 “relieves ERRα‐mediated repression” of mitochondrial pathways is at odds with the bulk of published data, which indicates that ERRα does not act as a repressor but rather as an activator of these pathways. Consequently, the use of an inverse agonist, in this case, would be predicted to hamper rather than enhance mitochondrial function in hepatocytes.

Strengths in considering XCT790 include its extensive use in experimental settings, high selectivity, and well‐documented binding to ERRα. Additionally, its effects on VLDL secretion and intracellular triglyceride content are well reproducible in various rodent models, providing clear mechanistic endpoints that can be assayed. On the downside, the overall profile of ERRα activity in the liver suggests that its inhibition may ultimately exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction—a critical driver of NASH pathogenesis—rather than alleviate it (“Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.; Yang et al., 2020). There is also a paucity of clinical or advanced preclinical data supporting its benefit in NASH, and the potential for adverse effects related to compromised mitochondrial energy production is a considerable concern.

In summary, while XCT790 is an excellent pharmacological tool for interrogating ERRα‐dependent pathways, the evidence from biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature does not robustly support its repurposing for the treatment of NASH. Its inverse agonist activity is more likely to reduce mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation—key processes that are already impaired in NASH—thus potentially worsening the disease phenotype. Therefore, despite its utility in preclinical research and clear mechanistic target engagement, XCT790 appears to be a poor therapeutic candidate for NASH when assessed in the context of current understanding of hepatic ERRα function (“Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.; Yang et al., 2020; Xia, Dufour, & Giguère, 2019).
