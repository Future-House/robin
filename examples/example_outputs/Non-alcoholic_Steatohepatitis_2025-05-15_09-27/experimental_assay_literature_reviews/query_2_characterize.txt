Query: Characterize the roles of Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells, and infiltrating immune cells in NASH progression, focusing on TLR-mediated signaling, inflammasome activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine networks (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6), chemokine release, and cell–cell cross-talk in vitro

Kupffer cells (KCs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and infiltrating immune cells collaborate in a complex network that drives the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), largely through TLR-mediated signaling, inflammasome activation, and the establishment of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine networks. KCs, the liver‐resident macrophages, express pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released by stressed or dying hepatocytes. When activated through TLRs like TLR4 and TLR9, these cells trigger downstream signaling pathways involving NF-κB and MAP kinases, resulting in the production of key pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (chen2020kupffercellsin pages 2-3).

TLR engagement in KCs also primes the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an intracellular multiprotein complex that leads to caspase-1 activation and the maturation of IL-1β. This inflammasome activation not only amplifies the inflammatory cascade but also contributes to hepatocyte injury and pyroptosis, thereby reinforcing the cycle of inflammation (mendezsanchez2020thecellularpathways pages 2-4). In vitro experiments consistently show that stimulation of TLRs on KCs in co-culture systems results in robust cytokine secretion that mirrors in vivo pro-inflammatory states and contributes to the feed-forward amplification of liver injury (moayedfard2022theroleof pages 2-4).

Hepatic stellate cells, which normally function in vitamin A storage and extracellular matrix homeostasis, are central to fibrosis once activated. Exposure to cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 secreted by KCs and infiltrating immune cells drives HSC transdifferentiation into myofibroblast-like cells. These activated HSCs secrete excessive collagen and other matrix proteins, culminating in fibrogenesis. Moreover, HSCs do not simply respond to these signals; they actively participate in cell–cell cross-talk by secreting mediators that further stimulate macrophage activation and sustain an inflammatory environment (carter2022hepaticstellatecellimmune pages 1-2).

In vitro co-culture studies have provided clear evidence of this bidirectional communication. HSCs not only respond to cytokines but also release chemokines such as CX3CL1 that modulate macrophage phenotype, dampening pro-fibrogenic activity in some contexts. This complex cross-talk emphasizes that HSCs contribute more than a passive fibrotic response; they dynamically regulate the immune microenvironment by influencing both innate and adaptive cell responses (carter2022hepaticstellatecellimmune pages 3-4).

In addition to resident KCs, infiltrating immune cells—especially monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils—are critical for sustaining and amplifying the inflammatory milieu. Chemokine release from KCs, including CCL2 and CCL5, drives the recruitment of these cells into the liver. Once in the liver, recruited macrophages adopt a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, further producing TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 in a manner that reinforces local inflammation and activates HSCs (cha2018theroleof pages 2-4). Neutrophils, recruited by chemokines and activated by signals from injured hepatocytes, release myeloperoxidase (MPO) and related mediators that not only contribute to direct tissue injury but also engage in cross-talk with HSCs to promote fibrogenesis (grunhut2018macrophagesinnonalcoholic pages 8-10).

Moreover, TLR-mediated signaling in these infiltrating cells perpetuates the cycle: continuous recognition of PAMPs and DAMPs sustains inflammasome activation and cytokine production, which, through in vitro co-culture models, has been shown to further activate HSCs and modulate the polarization states of macrophages—tilting the balance towards a predominantly pro-inflammatory environment (grunhut2018macrophagesinnonalcoholic pages 5-6). This immune cell interplay is orchestrated by a network of chemokines and cytokines that amplify the inflammatory signal, ensuring recruitment of additional immune cells and promoting a persistent and deleterious cycle that underlies the transition from steatosis to steatohepatitis.

In summary, Kupffer cells serve as the initial responders by detecting danger signals via TLRs, which activate inflammasomes and drive the secretion of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6. These cytokines not only propagate inflammation but also activate HSCs, inducing fibrogenesis, in concert with a chemokine-mediated recruitment of additional immune cells that further intensify the inflammatory and fibrogenic responses observed in NASH. The intricate cell–cell cross-talk observed in vitro underscores the pivotal roles of these liver cells in establishing the pathogenic milieu characteristic of NASH (moayedfard2022theroleof pages 4-5, nati2022theroleof pages 3-4).
