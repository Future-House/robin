Query: Investigate the molecular mechanisms driving hepatic lipid accumulation, altered lipid droplet dynamics, de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation impairment, and insulin resistance in Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis pathogenesis, including key transcriptional regulators and metabolic enzymes

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) develops through a convergence of molecular mechanisms that lead to hepatic lipid accumulation, altered lipid droplet dynamics, increased de novo lipogenesis, impaired fatty acid oxidation, and insulin resistance. Hepatic lipid accumulation is driven by an imbalance between lipid acquisition and disposal. Insulin resistance increases the release of free fatty acids (FFAs) from adipose tissue, while simultaneously upregulating de novo lipogenesis via increased carbohydrate flux; both lead to excessive triglyceride (TG) accumulation in hepatocytes (bessone2019molecularpathwaysof pages 1-2).

At the transcriptional level, several factors orchestrate these metabolic derangements. Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein 1c (SREBP-1c) is a central transcription factor that, in response to insulin and metabolic cues, promotes the expression of key lipogenic enzymes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1); this culminates in enhanced de novo lipogenesis and lipid droplet formation (li2023srebpregulationof pages 2-4). Carbohydrate-responsive Element-Binding Protein (ChREBP) similarly responds to carbohydrate metabolites to induce glycolytic and lipogenic gene expression, reinforcing TG synthesis in the liver (chakravarthy2020themetabolicbasis pages 1-2).

The role of genetically determined factors is also critical in modulating lipid droplet dynamics. Notably, the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3), particularly in the context of its I148M variant, exerts a dominant effect by impairing triglyceride hydrolysis and altering lipid droplet remodeling, which consequently promotes steatosis and fibrosis (OpenTargets Search, bessone2019molecularpathwaysof pages 4-6). Dysregulation of PNPLA3 not only leads to TG accumulation but also contributes to fibrogenic responses via activation of stellate cells (filalimouncef2022theménageà pages 14-15).

Fatty acid oxidation is primarily regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), with PPAR-α being essential for upregulating mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) that mediate fatty acid catabolism; however, in NASH, downregulation of PPAR-α and CPT1A activity results in impaired fatty acid oxidation and further lipid accumulation (steensels2020transcriptionalregulationin pages 10-12). In parallel, insulin resistance exacerbates these defects by impairing both the suppression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and mitochondrial oxidative capacity in hepatocytes (sakurai2021roleofinsulin pages 3-5).

Additional transcriptional regulators contribute to the metabolic dysregulation seen in NASH. Forkhead Box protein O1 (FoxO1) modulates gluconeogenic and lipogenic pathways, thereby linking dysregulated glucose metabolism with enhanced lipid synthesis, while alterations in other nuclear receptors (e.g., FXR and LXR) further disturb lipid homeostasis by modifying the expression of genes involved in both lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (steensels2020transcriptionalregulationin pages 23-25). Moreover, the interplay of these regulators with signaling pathways, such as PI3K-Akt-mTOR and AMPK, modulates both the activation status of SREBP-1c and the overall metabolic balance; inhibition of AMPK, for example, removes a key negative regulatory input on lipogenesis (boeckmans2022transcriptomicsrevealsdiscordant pages 15-16).

Oxidative stress arising from lipotoxicity and the accumulation of toxic lipid intermediates further exacerbates hepatocellular injury and inflammation, creating a milieu that perpetuates insulin resistance and fibrosis (yang2019oxidativestressand pages 3-5). Overall, the intricate network of genetic variants such as those in PNPLA3, transcriptional regulators like SREBP-1c, ChREBP, and FoxO1, and metabolic enzymes including ACC, FASN, SCD1, and CPT1A integrates to drive the progression from simple steatosis toward advanced NASH (gapp2020farnesoidxreceptor pages 16-16, steensels2020transcriptionalregulationin pages 6-8).
