Query: Elucidate endoplasmic reticulum stress responses, unfolded protein response pathways (PERK, ATF6, IRE1α), mitochondrial dysfunction mechanisms, ROS generation, and downstream apoptotic and fibrogenic signaling cascades in hepatocytes under lipotoxic conditions relevant to NASH

Under lipotoxic conditions relevant to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatocytes experience significant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress—a condition arising from the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins and exacerbated by high levels of saturated free fatty acids. Lipotoxicity disrupts ER homeostasis by saturating the chaperone BiP/GRP78, which under basal conditions binds and inactivates the three primary unfolded protein response (UPR) sensors: PERK (EIF2AK3), ATF6, and IRE1α (ajoolabady2023endoplasmicreticulumstress pages 1-3).

Once BiP dissociates, PERK rapidly oligomerizes and phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), resulting in a global attenuation of protein translation that helps reduce the protein-folding load. However, this phosphorylation selectively enhances the translation of ATF4, a transcription factor that upregulates genes involved in redox balance, amino acid metabolism, and apoptosis—including the pro-apoptotic factor CHOP. CHOP induction is critically involved in promoting apoptotic cascades within hepatocytes under chronic stress conditions (ajoolabady2023endoplasmicreticulumstress pages 3-5, shreya2023unfoldedproteinresponse pages 4-5).

In parallel, ATF6—another ER transmembrane protein—dissociates from BiP, translocates to the Golgi apparatus, and undergoes proteolytic cleavage into its active form ATF6p50. This active transcription factor moves to the nucleus where it induces the expression of ER chaperones and components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery. By upregulating these genes, ATF6 attempts to restore proper protein folding capacity and reduce ER stress; nevertheless, sustained ATF6 activation may also contribute indirectly to inflammatory processes that exacerbate hepatocytic injury (ajoolabady2023endoplasmicreticulumstress pages 3-5).

IRE1α, the most conserved UPR sensor, is activated through oligomerization and autophosphorylation. Its activated endoribonuclease domain then performs an unconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA to generate the spliced transcription factor XBP1s, which drives the expression of genes responsible for protein folding, ERAD, and lipid metabolism. Additionally, IRE1α interacts with TRAF2, leading to activation of apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (ASK1) and downstream JNK signaling, pathways that potentiate apoptotic cell death when ER stress is prolonged (ajoolabady2023endoplasmicreticulumstress pages 1-3, ajoolabady2023endoplasmicreticulumstress pages 3-5).

Mitochondrial dysfunction is an integral component of lipotoxic stress in hepatocytes. The ER stress response, particularly via the PERK-ATF4-CHOP axis, triggers changes in calcium homeostasis; abnormal release of Ca²⁺ from the ER impairs mitochondrial function and disrupts oxidative phosphorylation. This inefficiency in mitochondrial bioenergetics subsequently results in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further damage both mitochondrial and ER proteins, thereby creating a vicious cycle of cellular injury (liu2019endoplasmicreticulumstress pages 6-8, geng2020lipotoxicityinnonalcoholic pages 15-18).

Excessive ROS not only inflict oxidative damage on cellular macromolecules but also serve as secondary messengers that amplify stress signaling pathways, including those mediated by JNK, leading to further activation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and caspases. Such signaling cascades commit hepatocytes to programmed cell death when adaptive mechanisms fail (lee2022perkpreventshepatic pages 1-2). Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction and persistent oxidative stress contribute to fibrogenic signaling; dying hepatocytes and the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) activate hepatic stellate cells, which in turn promote extracellular matrix deposition and liver fibrosis—a hallmark of progressive NASH (maiers2019endoplasmicreticulumstress pages 11-12, zhou2022endoplasmicreticulumstress pages 2-4).

Of note, saturated fatty acids such as palmitate exacerbate these processes by increasing ceramide synthesis, which impairs ER Ca²⁺-ATPase function and further disrupts Ca²⁺ homeostasis, amplifying both mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS generation. This molecular interplay between ER stress sensors and mitochondrial pathways thus creates a network of intracellular signals that integrate adaptive responses with cell death and fibrogenic processes (yang2024huganqingzhitablets pages 11-11, ajoolabady2023endoplasmicreticulumstress pages 22-23).

In summary, under lipotoxic conditions in NASH, hepatocytes engage ER stress responses through the coordinated activation of PERK, ATF6, and IRE1α pathways. While these UPR mechanisms initially aim to restore ER function by attenuating protein synthesis and boosting chaperone capacities, persistent ER stress—coupled with disrupted calcium signaling and excessive ROS production—leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of apoptotic pathways, and stimulation of fibrogenic cascades. This integrated cascade of molecular events underlies hepatocyte injury, apoptosis, and fibrosis in the pathogenesis of NASH (ajoolabady2023endoplasmicreticulumstress pages 12-14, ajoolabady2023endoplasmicreticulumstress pages 22-23).
