Query: Compile best practices for developing cell culture assays for NASH drug screening, including optimal hepatocyte lines or iPSC-derived models, co-culture with non-parenchymal cells, induction protocols for steatosis and inflammation, endpoint biomarkers (lipid staining, cytokine panels, fibrogenic markers), and quantitative readouts

The best practices for developing cell culture assays for NASH drug screening involve detailed optimization of cell model selection, co‐culture strategies, induction protocols, endpoint biomarkers, and quantitative readouts. First, selecting optimal hepatocyte models is critical. Primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) remain physiologically relevant; however, their limited availability and shortened lifespan make them less ideal for long-term or high‐throughput screens (muller2019humaninvitro pages 1-2). In contrast, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)‐derived hepatocytes offer a renewable, patient-specific option that can recapitulate NASH-specific phenotypes such as spontaneous steatosis seen in donor-derived cells (gurevich2020ipscderivedhepatocytesgenerated pages 4-6, gurevich2020ipscderivedhepatocytesgenerated pages 6-9). Meanwhile, hepatoma cell lines such as HepG2, Huh7, or HepaRG have been widely used as surrogate models, although they generally do not provide full fidelity to in vivo hepatocyte physiology (muller2019humaninvitro pages 2-4).

Equally important is the inclusion of non-parenchymal cells to recreate the complex liver microenvironment. Co-culture systems should incorporate key cell types such as Kupffer cells (liver macrophages), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and liver endothelial cells to capture the interplay between steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis (pelecha2021cellmodelsand pages 1-2, rafiei2023developmentofa pages 1-2). These co-culture strategies have been shown to enhance hepatocyte functionality, for instance, increasing albumin secretion in 3D organoid models, and are essential for modeling fibrogenic responses via stellate cell activation (pelecha2021cellmodelsand pages 7-9, rezvani2023modelingnonalcoholicfatty pages 2-3).

Induction protocols for simulating NASH pathology should involve exposing the cell systems to pathophysiologically relevant stressors. Steatosis can be induced by treating cultures with free fatty acids (FFAs) like oleic and palmitic acids, which promote dose-dependent intracellular lipid accumulation measurable by lipid staining techniques (gurevich2020ipscderivedhepatocytesgenerated pages 4-6, soret2020invitroand pages 11-13). In addition, inducing inflammation requires the addition of cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6) or using agents such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to trigger immune responses, while fibrogenic activation can be modeled by adding TGFβ to activate HSCs, resulting in increased expression of collagen and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (holmgren2020characterizationofhuman pages 10-12, rafiei2023developmentofa pages 1-2).

Endpoint biomarkers must be multiparametric to capture the multidimensional aspects of NASH. Lipid accumulation is typically quantified using imaging-based lipid stains, such as Oil Red O, Nile Red, or BODIPY dyes, to assess the extent of steatosis (soret2020invitroand pages 11-13, silva2025inducedpluripotentstem pages 4-5). Quantifying inflammatory responses should involve cytokine panels, measuring key cytokines like TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β using ELISAs or multiplex assays (muller2019humaninvitro pages 1-2, pelecha2021cellmodelsand pages 10-11). For fibrogenic readouts, reliable markers include the expression levels of collagen type I, α-SMA, TGF-β, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (silva2025inducedpluripotentstem pages 5-7, rezvani2023modelingnonalcoholicfatty pages 3-5).

Quantitative readouts should integrate imaging, biochemical, and gene expression approaches. Microscopy-based imaging permits precise quantification of lipid droplets and cellular morphology, while gene expression analyses (e.g., RT-qPCR) allow for monitoring of key hepatic, inflammatory, and fibrogenic markers (pelecha2021cellmodelsand pages 7-9, soret2020invitroand pages 11-13). Additionally, functional assays such as CYP3A4 activity measurements provide insights into the metabolic competence of hepatocytes, helping to assess both basal hepatic function and drug-induced modulation (gurevich2020ipscderivedhepatocytesgenerated pages 6-9).

Overall, combining these approaches—using optimized hepatocyte models (whether primary, iPSC-derived, or hepatoma lines), establishing co-culture systems with key non-parenchymal cells, employing physiologically relevant induction protocols, and integrating multiparametric endpoint biomarkers with robust quantitative readouts—creates a comprehensive, human-relevant platform for NASH drug screening (gurevich2020ipscderivedhepatocytesgenerated pages 4-6, rafiei2023developmentofa pages 1-2, soret2020invitroand pages 11-13).
