Therapeutic Candidate 1:
Candidate: C75 (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #C9492)
Hypothesis: C75, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor, will reduce malonyl-CoA levels in NASH hepatocytes, thereby relieving malonyl-CoA–mediated inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and enhancing mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation to decrease steatosis.
Reasoning: C75 has been shown in rodent NASH models to inhibit FAS and lower malonyl-CoA, resulting in increased CPT1 activity and reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation. Genetic evidence links malonyl-CoA accumulation to NASH severity, and functional assays confirm C75 engages FAS with nanomolar potency.
