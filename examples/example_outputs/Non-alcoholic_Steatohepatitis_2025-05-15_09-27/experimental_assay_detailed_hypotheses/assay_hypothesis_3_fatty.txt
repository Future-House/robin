Assay Overview:
The proposed assay focuses on measuring fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in hepatocytes by quantifying mitochondrial and peroxisomal β‐oxidation via real‐time oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements using a Seahorse analyzer. In this assay, cultured hepatocytes—such as primary human hepatocytes, HepG2 cells, or the more metabolically competent HepaRG cells—are treated with fatty acid substrates (typically palmitate) to stimulate FAO. During the assay, OCR is recorded in the presence of modulators that target key regulatory enzymes, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor α (PPARα). These measurements provide dynamic readouts of both basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration, ATP-linked respiration, and the spare respiratory capacity, effectively modeling the capacity of hepatocytes to catabolize lipids under conditions relevant to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) pathogenesis (duan2022therapeutictargetingof pages 5-6, li2022mitochondriahomeostasisbiology pages 7-8).

Biomedical Evidence:
NASH pathogenesis is closely linked to impaired lipid homeostasis, wherein aberrant fatty acid β‐oxidation contributes to hepatocellular lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation. The functional disruption of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism is a hallmark of NASH, with reduced CPT1A activity and diminished PPARα signaling commonly reported in both experimental models and clinical settings (duan2022therapeutictargetingof pages 1-3). Moreover, preclinical studies have shown that restoring fatty acid catabolism can ameliorate hepatic lipid overload and fibrosis, directly linking enhanced mitochondrial FAO with improved liver function. Thus, measuring changes in OCR in response to fatty acids not only provides insight into mitochondrial function but also serves as a surrogate for the broader metabolic state of the hepatocyte, reflecting alterations in disease-relevant pathways such as those mediated by PPARα (mcginnis2022biochemicalmechanismsof pages 6-7, ciaula2021mitochondriamattersystemic pages 32-34).

Previous Use:
Seahorse-based fatty acid oxidation assays have been extensively employed in early-stage drug discovery to evaluate metabolic modulators in NASH. For instance, studies using HepG2 cells and primary hepatocyte-derived models have documented that treatment-related improvements in OCR correlate with reductions in lipid deposition and enhanced mitochondrial efficiency (maseko2023comparisonofheparg pages 2-3). Furthermore, pharmacologic interventions, such as the use of abemaciclib in NASH models, have demonstrated that increased mitochondrial respiration and FAO are associated with significant reductions in hepatic triglyceride accumulation and fibrosis, underscoring the relevance of OCR as a functional endpoint in drug screening (duan2022therapeutictargetingof pages 5-6). In addition, similar analyses have been leveraged to evaluate the efficacy of mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants in restoring FAO and limiting oxidative stress, further validating the utility of such assays in assessing compounds with beneficial metabolic effects (amorim2022mitochondriatargetedantioxidantantioxcin4 pages 2-4, morenofernandez2018peroxisomalβoxidationregulates pages 14-15).

Overall Evaluation:
The primary strength of this fatty acid oxidation assay lies in its ability to deliver real-time, quantitative assessments of mitochondrial function under conditions that closely mimic the metabolic stress observed in NASH. Its readouts, including basal respiration, ATP-linked respiration, and maximal respiratory capacity, provide comprehensive insights into the cellular bioenergetic state and the efficacy of therapeutic compounds in restoring lipid catabolism. Moreover, the assay’s sensitivity enables the detection of subtle changes in mitochondrial dynamics that may precede overt cellular damage.

However, there are limitations inherent to this approach. The metabolic behavior of hepatocyte cell lines can differ substantially; for example, HepG2 cells often exhibit decreased mitochondrial respiration compared to the more physiologically relevant HepaRG cells, potentially affecting the translation of in vitro findings (maseko2023comparisonofheparg pages 2-3). Additionally, the highly controlled in vitro environment may not fully recapitulate the complex in vivo liver microenvironment, where interactions with non-parenchymal cells and systemic factors further modulate NAFLD/NASH pathogenesis (li2022mitochondriahomeostasisbiology pages 7-8). Despite these challenges, the assay remains a robust and indispensable tool in the early phases of drug discovery, particularly for identifying compounds that target mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired fatty acid oxidation—a central mechanism in NASH (bellanti2018synergisticinteractionof pages 6-7, maseko2024mitochondrialfunctionsin pages 49-54).
