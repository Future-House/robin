Assay Overview:
The lipogenesis flux assay is designed to quantitatively measure de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in hepatocyte cultures by tracking the incorporation of stable isotope–labeled substrates, such as 13C–acetate or 13C–glucose, into newly synthesized fatty acids. Hepatocytes—either primary liver cells or established lines like HepG2—are incubated with the labeled substrates, after which the incorporation of the isotopes into lipid species is analyzed using mass spectrometry. This provides a direct, quantitative measurement of the activity of enzymes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FASN), which are primary drivers of DNL. In this way, the assay models a critical facet of NASH pathogenesis by replicating the aberrant lipid accumulation observed in hepatocytes (belew2022denovolipogenesis pages 64-68).

Biomedical Evidence:
Aberrant activation of the DNL pathway is a well-established contributor to the progression of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and its more severe form, Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). Increased expression and activity of lipogenic enzymes like ACC and FASN are directly linked to hepatic lipid overload, which fuels inflammation, fibrosis, and ultimately, liver injury. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that the synthesis of fatty acids via DNL is upregulated in NASH patients, correlating with disease severity and metabolic dysfunction. Moreover, stable isotope–based studies have provided mechanistic insights into how increased lipid synthesis contributes to pathological fat accumulation and the downstream inflammatory cascade. These findings underscore the clinical relevance of monitoring lipogenic flux, as interventions that reduce DNL may mitigate the progression of hepatic steatosis and inflammation (sunami2020nashfibrosisand pages 1-3, mccullough2018stableisotopebasedflux pages 9-11).

Previous Use:
Stable isotope flux assays have a strong track record in preclinical research focused on liver metabolism. Multiple studies have successfully used these assays to evaluate drug effects on DNL. For instance, the work by Ma et al. demonstrated the utility of such techniques in determining how modulators of glucose metabolism alter the rate of fatty acid synthesis in hepatocyte models (ma2025theeffectof pages 4-5). In another example, research into ACC inhibition and FXR agonism in NASH models has used similar methodologies to provide indirect metrics of therapeutic efficacy, linking reduced lipogenesis to improved metabolic outcomes (gapp2020farnesoidxreceptor pages 16-16). Furthermore, recent studies have established in vitro models that recapitulate an activated DNL state similar to that observed in patients with metabolic liver diseases, reinforcing the translational relevance of lipogenesis flux assays (kim2023characterizationofan pages 4-6).

Overall Evaluation:
The lipogenesis flux assay offers several strengths as a tool for early-stage drug discovery in NASH. Its ability to provide a direct quantitative measure of DNL is crucial, as it reflects changes in central metabolic enzymes (ACC and FASN) that drive hepatic fat accumulation. The use of stable isotope tracers with mass spectrometry ensures high sensitivity and specificity, which is imperative for detecting subtle alterations in metabolic activity. Additionally, the assay’s direct link to a core pathogenic process—elevated lipogenesis—makes it highly relevant from both a mechanistic and clinical perspective (mccullough2018stableisotopebasedflux pages 11-12).
However, there are some limitations. Cell culture models, while useful, do not fully recapitulate the multicellular complexity and systemic influences present in vivo. Technical expertise and advanced equipment are required to perform stable isotope labeling and subsequent mass spectrometric analyses, potentially limiting accessibility in less-equipped laboratories (sunami2020nashfibrosisand pages 3-5, wang2022therapeuticefficacyof pages 1-3).
In conclusion, the lipogenesis flux assay represents a robust, translationally relevant approach for assessing the impact of therapeutic candidates on a central metabolic pathway involved in NASH, making it a valuable tool in the early stages of drug discovery.
