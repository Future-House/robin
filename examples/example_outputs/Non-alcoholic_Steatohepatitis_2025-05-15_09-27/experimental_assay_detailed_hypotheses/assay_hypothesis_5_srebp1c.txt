Assay Overview:
This assay employs hepatocyte lines engineered to stably express a luciferase reporter gene under the control of an SREBP1c‐responsive promoter, thereby providing a readout of lipogenic transcriptional activity. The assay models a key facet of Non‐alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) pathogenesis—dysregulated de novo lipogenesis driven by SREBP1c activity. The luciferase output is measured in a rapid, sensitive, and quantifiable manner to monitor pathway modulation upon drug treatment. Typically, immortalized hepatocyte lines are used for their ease of culture, reproducibility, and amenability to high-throughput screening (li2023srebpregulationof pages 2-4, musso2023lipidomicsinpathogenesis pages 14-18).

Biomedical Evidence:
SREBP1c is a central transcription factor regulating genes involved in fatty acid, triglyceride, and cholesterol synthesis. In NASH, chronic activation of SREBP1c drives hepatic steatosis via increased lipogenesis, contributing to lipid accumulation, lipotoxicity, inflammation, and fibrosis (li2023srebpregulationof pages 2-4, nakagawa2025lipogenesisandmasld pages 13-14). Clinically, NAFLD and its progressive form NASH are characterized by metabolic dysregulation resulting from enhanced de novo lipogenesis, indicating that modulation of SREBP1c activity is directly linked to disease progression (musso2023lipidomicsinpathogenesis pages 14-18). The therapeutic rationale for targeting SREBP1c is further strengthened by studies showing that both genetic manipulation and pharmacological inhibition of this pathway reduce hepatic triglyceride accumulation and ameliorate NASH pathology in animal models. This assay, therefore, directly interrogates a key biochemical and molecular node underlying the disease (li2023srebpregulationof pages 7-8).

Previous Use:
Luciferase reporter assays driven by SREBP1c-responsive promoters have been widely applied in early-stage drug discovery to screen for compounds that modulate lipogenesis. For instance, transgenic overexpression and knockdown studies have validated the causal role of SREBP1c in hepatic steatosis, where reporter assays were utilized to measure the transcriptional effects of candidate compounds on lipogenic gene expression (rao2021β2spectrin(sptbn1)as pages 6-8, li2023srebpregulationof pages 8-11). These assays have led to the identification of small molecules that inhibit SREBP1c activation, with subsequent validation in higher-order models including primary hepatocyte cultures and in vivo systems (musso2023lipidomicsinpathogenesis pages 14-18, kim2023characterizationofan pages 4-6).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of this assay include its high sensitivity and rapid quantitative readout afforded by the luciferase reporter, enabling efficient high-throughput screening of candidates that modulate SREBP1c-driven lipogenesis. Its direct measurement of transcriptional activity provides mechanistic insights into how candidate drugs affect a primary driver of hepatic steatosis central to NASH pathogenesis (li2023srebpregulationof pages 2-4). Additionally, the use of hepatocyte cell lines provides a controlled environment to isolate the effects on lipogenic transcription without the complexity of multicellular interactions, making it suitable for initial screening (breheresch2018genomicsoflipidladen pages 1-2).

However, there are several limitations. Reporter assays may oversimplify the complex regulatory networks of lipid metabolism as they do not capture post-translational modifications, protein trafficking events, or interactions with hormonal and inflammatory signals relevant in in vivo liver physiology (rao2021β2spectrin(sptbn1)as pages 8-9, pelecha2021cellmodelsand pages 22-23). Furthermore, the metabolic dynamics in immortalized hepatocyte lines may differ from primary human hepatocytes, potentially limiting translational predictability. Given that NASH involves inflammation, fibrosis, and additional cellular stress responses, reliance solely on SREBP1c transcriptional activity could miss compounds acting via complementary or alternative pathways. Thus, while the assay is highly valuable for initial mechanistic screening, positive hits should be validated in more comprehensive models, such as micropatterned primary hepatocytes or hiPSC-derived platforms, to assess compound efficacy in a more physiologically relevant context (cottier2023micropatternedprimaryhepatocyte pages 1-2, parafati2020pluripotentstemcellderived pages 11-13).

In conclusion, the SREBP1c luciferase reporter assay represents a compelling tool for early NASH drug discovery, offering speed, sensitivity, and mechanistic clarity, while necessitating further downstream validation to ensure clinical relevance.
