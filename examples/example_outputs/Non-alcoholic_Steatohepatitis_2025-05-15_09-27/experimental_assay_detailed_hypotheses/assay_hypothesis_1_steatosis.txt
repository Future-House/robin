Assay Overview:
This assay quantifies intracellular triglyceride accumulation by employing fluorescent lipid dyes such as BODIPY in primary human hepatocytes or HepaRG cells under free fatty acid (FFA) challenge. The core measurement is the accumulation of lipid droplets, which is captured using automated high-content imaging to provide quantitative readouts in terms of fluorescence intensity and lipid droplet area. The assay directly models the key pathological feature of Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)—steatosis—by simulating the lipid overload that occurs in hepatocytes during disease progression (muller2022chemicalscreeningof pages 4-6, wiriyakulsit2023amodelof pages 11-12).

Biomedical Evidence:
Hepatic lipid accumulation is central to the pathogenesis of NASH. The excessive accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes triggers downstream effects, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and ultimately, cell injury that precipitates inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical studies underscore that reducing the intracellular lipid burden is associated with improved liver function and diminished progression to more severe stages of liver disease. Thus, an assay that quantitatively assesses intracellular lipid droplets provides a direct measure of a core disease milestone and offers mechanistic insights into how candidate therapeutics may intervene in the disease process. This is particularly relevant given evidence that improvements in steatosis can mitigate subsequent inflammatory and fibrotic responses (muller2022chemicalscreeningof pages 8-9, Clinical Trials Search: Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis).

Previous Use:
There is a strong precedent for employing fluorescent lipid dyes, notably BODIPY, coupled with automated imaging to quantify steatosis in both primary human hepatocytes and HepaRG cells. Prior studies have demonstrated that such assays effectively capture dose-dependent lipid accumulation following exposure to steatogenic FFAs, enabling rapid screening for anti-steatotic effects of various compounds. Moreover, these assays have been integrated with multiparametric analyses that also assess mitochondrial membrane potential, oxidative stress, and nuclear morphology. This multi-endpoint screening has provided insights into the mechanistic pathways of drug-induced steatosis and facilitated in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (PBPK modeling and IVIVE), thereby enhancing the translational potential of preclinical findings (muller2022chemicalscreeningof pages 1-4, parafati2020pluripotentstemcellderived pages 1-3, donato2022invitromodels pages 30-30).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths: The assay’s major advantage lies in its simplicity, high-throughput potential, and direct relevance to one of the earliest and most critical endpoints of NASH—lipid droplet burden. Using human-derived hepatocytes, particularly HepaRG cells that maintain many primary hepatocyte functions, ensures a closer approximation to the in vivo scenario. Automated high-content imaging further enhances reproducibility and allows for rapid screening of candidate compounds in a cost-effective manner.
Weaknesses: Despite its utility as an early screening tool, this assay is limited by its reductionist nature. Two-dimensional monocultures lack the cellular complexity and microenvironmental context—such as interactions with Kupffer cells, stellate cells, and endothelial cells—that are critical for capturing the full spectrum of NASH pathology, including inflammation and fibrosis. Additionally, while HepaRG cells offer many benefits, they may not entirely recapitulate the metabolic and xenobiotic functionalities of fully differentiated primary hepatocytes. Complementary models, such as 3D co-cultures or liver-organ-on-a-chip platforms, might be required to fully assess therapeutic efficacy on complex drug-induced liver injury and fibrogenic outcomes (strobel2021a3dprimary pages 2-3, wiriyakulsit2023amodelof pages 11-12).

In conclusion, while the steatosis quantification assay using fluorescent lipid dyes and automated imaging provides a robust, high-content platform for early-stage screening of anti-steatotic compounds, it is best employed as part of a battery of assays that collectively address the multifactorial aspects of NASH pathogenesis (muller2022chemicalscreeningof pages 8-9, donato2022invitromodels pages 30-30).
