Proposal for XCT790 (Tocris Bioscience, Cat. #4392)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
XCT790 is a small‐molecule synthetic compound initially characterized as an inverse agonist of estrogen‐related receptor alpha (ERRα). It was chemically developed and is commercially available (Tocris Bioscience, Cat. #4392) as a pharmacological tool designed to selectively bind the ligand‐binding domain of ERRα and reduce its constitutive transcriptional activity. As a member of the nuclear receptor modulator class, XCT790 belongs to therapeutic candidates that modulate transcriptional regulators involved in energy metabolism. Compounds in this class have been used extensively in preclinical studies to dissect the roles of orphan nuclear receptors in metabolism and cancer biology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The design strategy for such modulators typically relies on synthetic methods that optimize binding affinity and selectivity while providing a means to “reverse” the receptor’s basal activity via inverse agonism.

Therapeutic History:
Biochemically, ERRα is well established as a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) through its transcriptional control of several mitochondrial and metabolic genes. In numerous preclinical studies, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of ERRα using inverse agonists such as XCT790 and structurally related compounds (e.g., C29) has been employed to probe the downstream effects of reduced ERRα activity in hepatocytes and other metabolic tissues ( “Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.). ERRα inverse agonists have been used in laboratory experiments to modulate hepatic very‐low‐density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, intracellular triglyceride handling, and lipid droplet formation in mouse hepatocytes (“Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.). Despite extensive use in vitro and in rodent models of metabolic syndrome, there is limited evidence of prior clinical or veterinary application of XCT790 specifically for non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or even non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Several clinical trials in related metabolic contexts have been initiated using ERRα‐targeted strategies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), yet direct therapeutic use of XCT790 in patients remains largely investigational and confined to experimental settings. In models of NAFLD/NASH, evidence from similar compounds indicates that inverse agonism of ERRα may lead to reduced hepatic VLDL secretion and paradoxically worsen lipid accumulation, suggesting that the historical experience with this drug class in hepatic disease is mixed and may counter conventional expectations (“Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.; Yang et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
XCT790 exerts its pharmacological effects by binding to the ligand‐binding domain of ERRα and stabilizing a conformation that favors corepressor recruitment over coactivator engagement. Under normal circumstances, ERRα cooperates with coactivators such as PGC1α to drive the transcription of genes critical for mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g., genes encoding components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain) and fatty acid oxidation enzymes such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) (Xia, Dufour, & Giguère, 2019). Inhibition by XCT790 is expected to diminish the receptor’s transcriptional output, resulting in decreased expression of these metabolic genes. However, the mechanistic literature reveals that ERRα is not a repressor of mitochondrial biogenesis—in fact, ERRα typically promotes mitochondrial oxidative capacity, enhances β‐oxidation, and supports lipid export via VLDL secretion (Yang et al., 2020). Experimental evidence in hepatocytes has shown that loss of ERRα activity, whether by genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition with inverse agonists such as XCT790 and C29, is associated with reduced expression of key lipid handling genes (e.g., Apob, Mttp, Pla2g12b) and may impair mitochondrial biogenesis indirectly via lower PGC1α activity (“Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.). On the other hand, some reports suggest that in rodent metabolic syndrome models, inhibition of ERRα may reduce hepatic triglyceride levels and improve insulin sensitivity by modifying VLDL secretion (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Despite these observations, detailed binding assays consistently confirm that XCT790 binds selectively to ERRα, thereby modulating the nuclear receptor’s ability to initiate transcription of genes involved in mitochondrial function and FAO (Tripathi & Reddemma Sandireddy, 2021). The net effect of XCT790, however, appears to be context dependent, with some studies indicating that inverse agonism further diminishes mitochondrial function rather than relieving repression—a finding that contrasts with the original hypothesis.

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis posits that by inhibiting ERRα with XCT790, the drug will relieve ERRα‐mediated repression of mitochondrial biogenesis and FAO gene expression in NASH hepatocytes. Specifically, it is anticipated that treatment with XCT790 in hepatocyte cultures will lead to enhanced expression of PGC1α and CPT1A, thereby boosting mitochondrial content and β‐oxidation capacity, which in turn should decrease intracellular hepatic triglyceride accumulation and improve insulin sensitivity. This expected effect is grounded in the idea that ERRα is a negative regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and that its inhibition will upregulate pathways involved in oxidative metabolism. However, consistent biochemical and in vivo studies have demonstrated that ERRα normally acts to positively regulate genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (Xia, Dufour, & Giguère, 2019; Audet‐Walsh & Giguère, 2015). Furthermore, in several rodent models, inhibition of ERRα with inverse agonists has been associated with decreased VLDL secretion and increased hepatic lipid accumulation, exacerbating NAFLD/NASH phenotypes rather than alleviating them (“Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.; Yang et al., 2020). Consequently, while the proposed assay may show changes in gene expression, the direction of the effect may not be beneficial when evaluated in the context of an already compromised mitochondrial function in NASH hepatocytes. The expected molecular outcome—that XCT790 increases mitochondrial content and β‐oxidation capacity by upregulating PGC1α and CPT1A—remains speculative given that robust preclinical evidence supports the role of ERRα in maintaining normal mitochondrial function (Tripathi & Reddemma Sandireddy, 2021; “Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
The evaluation of XCT790 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis yields mixed and, in some respects, contradictory evidence. On the one hand, XCT790 is a well‐characterized ERRα inverse agonist with robust target engagement and established use in mechanistic studies; its selectivity and potency in binding ERRα are advantageous for investigating nuclear receptor modulation in metabolic diseases (Tripathi & Reddemma Sandireddy, 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The compound has been shown to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism by affecting genes involved in VLDL secretion and intracellular triglyceride handling. Moreover, some rodent studies suggest that modulation of ERRα activity can alter insulin sensitivity and hepatic lipid profiles.

However, the fundamental weakness in the candidate’s therapeutic logic arises from the established physiological role of ERRα in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. ERRα generally functions as a positive regulator of mitochondrial gene expression—promoting oxidative phosphorylation, enhancing PGC1α expression, and ensuring efficient β‐oxidation (Xia, Dufour, & Giguère, 2019; Yang et al., 2020). Inhibition of ERRα using inverse agonists such as XCT790 has repeatedly been shown to diminish these beneficial processes, leading to reduced VLDL secretion and increased hepatic lipid accumulation, which are adverse outcomes in the context of NASH (“Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.). Furthermore, the mechanistic premise that XCT790 “relieves ERRα‐mediated repression” of mitochondrial pathways is at odds with the bulk of published data, which indicates that ERRα does not act as a repressor but rather as an activator of these pathways. Consequently, the use of an inverse agonist, in this case, would be predicted to hamper rather than enhance mitochondrial function in hepatocytes.

Strengths in considering XCT790 include its extensive use in experimental settings, high selectivity, and well‐documented binding to ERRα. Additionally, its effects on VLDL secretion and intracellular triglyceride content are well reproducible in various rodent models, providing clear mechanistic endpoints that can be assayed. On the downside, the overall profile of ERRα activity in the liver suggests that its inhibition may ultimately exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction—a critical driver of NASH pathogenesis—rather than alleviate it (“Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.; Yang et al., 2020). There is also a paucity of clinical or advanced preclinical data supporting its benefit in NASH, and the potential for adverse effects related to compromised mitochondrial energy production is a considerable concern.

In summary, while XCT790 is an excellent pharmacological tool for interrogating ERRα‐dependent pathways, the evidence from biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature does not robustly support its repurposing for the treatment of NASH. Its inverse agonist activity is more likely to reduce mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation—key processes that are already impaired in NASH—thus potentially worsening the disease phenotype. Therefore, despite its utility in preclinical research and clear mechanistic target engagement, XCT790 appears to be a poor therapeutic candidate for NASH when assessed in the context of current understanding of hepatic ERRα function (“Dysfunction of estrogen-related receptor alpha-dependent hepatic VLDL,” n.d.; Yang et al., 2020; Xia, Dufour, & Giguère, 2019).
