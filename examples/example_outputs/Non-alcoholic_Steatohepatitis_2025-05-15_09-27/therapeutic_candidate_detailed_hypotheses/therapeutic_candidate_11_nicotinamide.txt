Proposal for Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN, Cayman Chemical #B119460)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) is an endogenous nucleotide naturally present in various tissues that serves as a direct precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). It is typically derived from the vitamin B3 family, which includes niacin and nicotinamide, and functions by entering the NAD+ salvage pathway. NMN can be both isolated from natural sources and produced synthetically; in this candidate’s case it is provided as Cayman Chemical #B119460. NMN belongs to the class of NAD+ precursors, a group of compounds that have historically been used as nutritional supplements and therapeutic agents in anti-aging research. This class of compounds is known to boost intracellular NAD+ levels, thereby enhancing cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function. Numerous preclinical studies have established that NAD+ precursors like NMN not only have potential roles in ameliorating age-associated metabolic decline but also show promise in correcting metabolic disorders including diabetes and fatty liver conditions (Alegre & Pastore, 2023; Okabe et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, NAD+ precursors have been studied extensively for their capacity to restore declining NAD+ levels observed in aging and metabolic disorders. NMN, along with compounds like nicotinamide riboside (NR), has drawn increasing attention due to its ability to rapidly restore NAD+ levels in tissues, which then stimulates the activity of NAD+-dependent enzymes such as sirtuins. Early preclinical studies in rodent models have documented that NMN administration increased NAD+ content in multiple tissues, leading to improved mitochondrial respiratory capacity, enhanced β-oxidation, and reduced lipid accumulation in the liver. For instance, NMN has demonstrated efficacy in high-fat diet–fed mice by reversing declines in NAD+ levels and improving multiple metabolic parameters, including insulin sensitivity and hepatic lipid metabolism (Lu et al., 2024; Niño-Narvión et al., 2025). Although the direct application of NMN in Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) has not been as comprehensively evaluated clinically as in other disease models, emerging clinical trials and initial human studies have begun to assess NMN’s pharmacodynamics, tolerance, and effects on metabolic biomarkers—with encouraging safety and bioavailability profiles reported (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). Moreover, several clinical trial programs focused on NAD+ precursors, including those investigating NR and NMN in metabolic and cardiovascular dysfunction, bolster confidence in the translational potential of NMN for NASH, given the metabolic parallels between steatohepatitis and the metabolic syndromes previously investigated (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, NMN operates by entering the NAD+ salvage pathway where it serves as a substrate for NMN adenylyltransferases (Nmnat enzymes), which convert it into NAD+. NAD+ is a pivotal cofactor in redox reactions, required for essential metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and β-oxidation. Importantly, NAD+ is also a substrate for sirtuins (notably SIRT1 and SIRT3) whose activities are crucial for regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, energy metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress responses. SIRT1, for example, is known to regulate key transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), thereby driving mitochondrial biogenesis, improving fatty acid oxidation, and reducing lipid accumulation within hepatocytes (Okabe et al., 2019; Lee & Yang, 2019). Additionally, SIRT3, a mitochondrial sirtuin, is activated upon enhanced NAD+ availability provided by NMN supplementation and plays a crucial role in deacetylating and regulating mitochondrial enzymes, thus ensuring proper mitochondrial respiratory function and minimizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The increase in NAD+ levels further instigates enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which leads to improved oxygen consumption and energy production—a fundamental aspect in mitigating the metabolic disturbances seen in hepatic steatosis and NASH (Okabe et al., 2019; Lee & Yang, 2019). Moreover, preclinical evidence suggests that NMN can stimulate the NAD+-dependent activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a critical energy sensor, which in turn promotes catabolic pathways including fatty acid oxidation while inhibiting anabolic pathways such as de novo lipogenesis through the suppression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) (Wang et al., 2017).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for NMN’s utility in NASH is that by replenishing NAD+ levels in hepatocytes, NMN will drive the activation of SIRT1 and SIRT3, leading to enhanced mitochondrial β-oxidation and biogenesis, a reduction in oxidative stress, and an improvement in overall cellular metabolism. In the specific assays proposed, one would expect to see a measurable increase in cellular NAD+ content following NMN administration. This elevation in NAD+ should correlate with increased activity of SIRT1 and SIRT3, as evidenced by enhanced deacetylation of their molecular targets (e.g., PGC-1α) and upregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation such as CPT-1 and ACOX1 (Lu et al., 2024; Niño-Narvión et al., 2025). Functional assays like oxygen consumption measurements (e.g., using Seahorse analysis) are expected to demonstrate improved mitochondrial respiratory capacity, aligning with findings from rodent studies where NMN supplementation improved oxygen consumption and enhanced energy expenditure (Okabe et al., 2019). Furthermore, the anticipated downstream effects include a reduction in lipid accumulation within liver tissues, improvement in insulin sensitivity, and decreased oxidative stress markers. These effects are strongly supported by biochemical evidence from high-fat diet models where NMN administration led to improved mitochondrial function, upregulated expression of β-oxidation genes, and reduced hepatic steatosis (Poddar et al., 2019; Niño-Narvión et al., 2025). In hepatocytes from NASH models, increased SIRT1 activity is particularly critical since SIRT1 has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects and to promote fatty acid oxidation while suppressing lipogenesis; its expression is well-documented in liver cells, and its modulation by NAD+ levels is a central tenet of NMN’s proposed mechanism of action (Johnson & Imai, 2018; Lee & Yang, 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, NMN stands out as a promising therapeutic candidate for Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) due to its well-established role in replenishing NAD+ levels, which is a critical element in maintaining mitochondrial health, driving sirtuin activation, and regulating metabolic pathways that are adversely affected in NASH. One of the most significant strengths of NMN is its mechanistic specificity: by directly serving as a precursor in the NAD+ salvage pathway, it leads to enhanced activity of SIRT1 and SIRT3 which are central to mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and the reduction of oxidative stress—all key pathological features of NASH (Alegre & Pastore, 2023; Okabe et al., 2019). Preclinical studies in rodent models have consistently demonstrated that NMN supplementation leads to improved liver function, reduced hepatic steatosis, and enhanced metabolic performance, with robust evidence showing increased oxygen consumption and upregulation of β-oxidation genes in high-fat diet–fed mice (Lu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2017).

Additionally, safety and pharmacokinetic studies in mammals indicate good oral bioavailability and tolerability, with no significant toxicity observed at effective doses, which is a considerable advantage for further clinical development (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021; Okabe et al., 2022). The translational potential is further supported by the emerging clinical data demonstrating NMN’s capacity to raise NAD+ levels in human subjects without adverse effects, making it a clinically feasible intervention for metabolic liver disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). However, some weaknesses remain. Direct clinical evidence in NASH patients is still limited, and while preclinical data are promising, further rigorous clinical trials focusing specifically on NASH endpoints are essential. There is also the challenge of ensuring tissue-specific delivery and consistent bioavailability to the liver, as well as determining the optimal dosing regimen to achieve sustained NAD+ restoration without stimulating any off-target effects.

Overall, the accumulated evidence from numerous preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials presents NMN as a mechanistically sound, safe, and effective agent for restoring NAD+ levels, driving sirtuin activation, and enhancing mitochondrial function in hepatocytes. These changes are expected to mitigate steatosis and oxidative stress—the hallmark features of NASH. Given the convincing data from rodent models and the encouraging safety profile in human studies, advancing NMN into NASH-specific clinical trials is justified. The strengths of NMN lie in its targeted mechanism of action and its ability to act on specific metabolic processes that are dysregulated in NASH, while its weaknesses primarily relate to the need for further direct clinical evidence. On balance, NMN has considerable potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for NASH and warrants continued development and evaluation in this disease context (Alegre & Pastore, 2023; Niño-Narvión et al., 2025; Okabe et al., 2019).
