Proposal for Urolithin A (MITOPURE, Amazentis)

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of Urolithin A (MITOPURE, Amazentis) for the treatment of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH):

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Urolithin A (UA) is a bioactive metabolite produced by the gut microbiota through the bioconversion of dietary ellagitannins and ellagic acid found in pomegranates, berries, and walnuts. It exists as a naturally occurring postbiotic and is marketed by Amazentis under the trade name MITOPURE. UA belongs to a class of therapeutic compounds known as urolithins, which are microbial metabolites that have emerged as modulators of mitochondrial quality control processes. The discovery of UA originated from studies focused on how gut microbiota process polyphenols into bioavailable metabolites that can exert systemic effects related to mitochondrial function. UA falls within the broader category of nutraceuticals with potential pharmacological benefits; historically, compounds derived from ellagitannins have been investigated for their antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties, but only recently has the explicit role of UA in enhancing mitochondrial function been recognized (Faitg et al., 2024). In addition, UA is of interest because it has been shown to induce mitophagy, a quality control mechanism that ensures the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria, and also appears to promote mitochondrial biogenesis via activation of pathways such as SIRT1-PGC-1α (Faitg et al., 2024). This dual mechanism makes UA a promising candidate for restoring hepatic energy metabolism and reducing pathological lipid accumulation in NASH, a condition characterized by excessive hepatic fat deposition, inflammation, and fibrosis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, urolithins, including UA, have been evaluated primarily for their effects on muscle aging, neurodegeneration, and metabolic diseases. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that UA extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans and improves muscle function in rodent models by enhancing mitochondrial respiration and increasing energy production (Ryu et al., 2016). In randomized clinical trials, specifically in elderly populations, UA supplementation has been shown to be safe, demonstrating favorable bioavailability and improvements in mitochondrial gene expression – hallmark indicators of improved mitochondrial quality (Faitg et al., 2024; Toney et al., 2021). Moreover, studies in obese mouse models have noted that UA administration leads to a reduction in hepatic triglyceride accumulation and systemic inflammation – findings that are directly relevant to the therapeutic milieu seen in NASH (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Raimundo et al., 2021). While UA has not been extensively used in the clinic for NASH specifically, the preclinical history in related metabolic diseases and liver injury models – including acetaminophen-induced liver injury – provide a strong basis for its repurposing in NASH (Gao et al., 2022). This evidence, combined with emerging data from mechanistic studies demonstrating UA’s ability to induce mitophagy via the Parkin/PINK1 axis, has spurred further interest in investigating UA as a novel agent targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in NASH (Jayatunga et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
Urolithin A’s primary mechanism revolves around the induction of mitophagy, which is the selective degradation of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria. At the molecular level, this process is orchestrated by the PINK1/Parkin pathway; when mitochondria become depolarized or sustain damage, the kinase PINK1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it recruits and activates the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin. Activated Parkin ubiquitinates various mitochondrial proteins, thereby marking the mitochondrion for autophagic degradation via the autophagosome and subsequent fusion with lysosomes (Faitg et al., 2024; Ryu et al., 2016). In multiple experimental models – from C. elegans to rodents – UA has been shown to increase the expression and phosphorylation of Parkin (especially at Ser65) and to augment LC3 recruitment onto mitochondria, which are key indicators of active mitophagic flux (Faitg et al., 2024; Makarov & Korkotian, 2023). Additionally, UA has been observed to engage the SIRT1-PGC-1α axis, a known regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. By upregulating SIRT1, UA indirectly enhances the transcriptional activity of PGC-1α, leading to increased synthesis of mitochondrial proteins and replication of mitochondrial DNA – essential for replacing the pool of cleared damaged mitochondria (Faitg et al., 2024; Toney et al., 2021). Complementary evidence from cellular studies further indicates that UA activates AMPK, a cellular energy sensor that not only initiates autophagic processes via ULK1 but also inhibits mTOR, thereby indirectly facilitating mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis (Toney et al., 2021; Makarov & Korkotian, 2023). Although several studies have concentrated on the effect of UA in skeletal muscle, the mechanistic pathways involved have significant parallels in hepatocytes, where mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired β-oxidation contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH. In hepatocytes, the activation of mitophagy would clear dysfunctional mitochondria, reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species, and enhance the cellular capacity for fatty acid β-oxidation, thereby lowering intracellular lipid burden (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Raimundo et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
Based on preclinical studies and preliminary human data, the expectation is that UA will exert a multi-faceted beneficial effect on NASH hepatocytes. In the proposed NASH model, UA is hypothesized to induce robust mitophagy via activation of the PINK1/Parkin pathway, which will lead to efficient clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria that are known to accumulate in NASH due to metabolic stress and lipid overload (Jayatunga et al., 2021; Senavirathna et al., 2024). As dysfunctional mitochondria contribute to decreased fatty acid β-oxidation and impaired energy homeostasis, their removal would restore metabolic equilibrium and improve the oxidative capacity of hepatocytes. This restoration is anticipated to be complemented by stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis via the upregulation of SIRT1-PGC-1α signaling – a pathway that has been shown to be activated by UA in previous studies and is critical in regenerating the healthy mitochondrial pool (Faitg et al., 2024; Toney et al., 2021). Consequently, the expected cellular effect is an increase in mitochondrial respiration, enhanced clearance of toxic lipid metabolites, and reduced oxidative stress, ultimately leading to diminished hepatic inflammation and fibrosis – key endpoints in the progression of NASH (Raimundo et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2022). In hepatocytes, the gene products of both Parkin and PINK1 are expressed and are crucial in governing the mitophagy process; thus, their upregulation in response to UA treatment is a plausible and desirable outcome in this assay (Makarov & Korkotian, 2023). The cumulative effect of these processes would be an enhanced ability of hepatocytes to oxidize fatty acids, reduce triglyceride accumulation, and alleviate the inflammation-fibrosis cascade that drives NASH progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Senavirathna et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Our overall assessment of Urolithin A as a repurposed drug candidate for NASH is highly encouraging, with several strengths that support its further investigation. First, the natural origin of UA from dietary ellagitannins, along with its proven safety profile in clinical phase I trials, provides a strong translational benefit with minimal toxicity concerns (Toney et al., 2021; Ryu et al., 2016). Second, the mechanistic rationale underpinning UA’s mode of action is robust; extensive preclinical data demonstrate that UA induces mitophagy via the PINK1/Parkin pathway and stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis via SIRT1-PGC-1α and AMPK activation – processes that are directly deficient in NASH hepatocytes (Faitg et al., 2024; Toney et al., 2021). This mitophagy-centric approach is expected to address a fundamental pathogenic mechanism in NASH, namely the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria that deranges fatty acid oxidation and promotes oxidative stress (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Raimundo et al., 2021). Third, UA has demonstrated efficacy in reducing hepatic triglyceride levels and systemic inflammation in obese mouse models, suggesting that its benefits extend beyond skeletal muscle and into hepatic tissue, which is the primary target in NASH (Gao et al., 2022; Senavirathna et al., 2024). Fourth, the fact that UA can be administered orally, exhibits dose-linear pharmacokinetics, and shows clear target engagement in human trials is particularly valuable for a chronic condition like NASH that requires long-term management (Toney et al., 2021; Faitg et al., 2024).

Despite these strengths, several potential weaknesses and knowledge gaps remain that must be addressed. Although mechanistic studies strongly support the role of UA in inducing mitophagy and stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis, most of these studies have been conducted in the context of muscle aging or acute liver injury models, such as acetaminophen-induced injury, rather than chronic models of NASH (Gao et al., 2022; Senavirathna et al., 2024). Direct evidence from in vitro studies using NASH-relevant hepatic cell lines or in vivo non-alcoholic steatohepatitis animal models specifically demonstrating a reduction in hepatic lipid burden is still limited. Furthermore, while the clinical safety profile is promising, detailed efficacy data in a NASH patient population, including histological endpoints such as fibrosis regression and improvement in steatosis scores, have yet to be fully reported (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Raimundo et al., 2021). There is also a need to further dissect whether UA’s benefits in the liver are solely due to mitophagy induction or whether additional mechanisms—such as modulation of inflammatory signaling pathways (e.g., Nrf2 activation)—play a synergistic role (Gao et al., 2022; Toney et al., 2021). Finally, interindividual variations in gut microbial metabotypes that affect endogenous UA production underscore the importance of ensuring consistent bioavailability in the target population, making the standardized formulation (MITOPURE) a critical asset in clinical translation (Toney et al., 2021; Senavirathna et al., 2024).

In conclusion, Urolithin A demonstrates significant promise as a therapeutic candidate for NASH via its ability to induce mitophagy, clear dysfunctional mitochondria, and stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis in hepatocytes. These mechanistic effects are expected to enhance fatty acid β-oxidation, reduce hepatic lipid accumulation, and mitigate inflammation—a multi-pronged approach that addresses fundamental aspects of NASH pathophysiology (Jayatunga et al., 2021; Toney et al., 2021). The preclinical data, combined with favorable human safety profiles and early signs of metabolic benefits, provide a compelling rationale for advancing UA into further efficacy studies in NASH models and clinical trials. However, additional focused studies specifically interrogating UA’s impact on liver histopathology, mitochondrial biogenesis in hepatocytes, and long-term clinical outcomes in NASH patients will be necessary to validate its use in this indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Raimundo et al., 2021). Overall, the strengths of UA—including its dual action on both mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis, its natural origin with excellent safety margins, and its potential to correct key metabolic defects in NASH—outweigh the current limitations, making it a highly promising candidate for further development in the NASH therapeutic arena.
