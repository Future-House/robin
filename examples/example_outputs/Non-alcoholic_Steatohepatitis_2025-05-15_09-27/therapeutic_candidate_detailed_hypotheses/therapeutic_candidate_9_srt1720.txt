Proposal for SRT1720 (Cayman Chemical, Cat. #12010)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SRT1720 is a synthetic small‐molecule activator developed to target sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a NAD⁺‐dependent deacetylase that plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress responses. This compound, available from Cayman Chemical (Cat. #12010), belongs to the class of SIRT1 activators—agents designed to mimic or enhance the enzyme’s natural activity. SRT1720 was discovered through high‐throughput screening efforts and later structurally optimized to achieve an approximately 1,000‐fold higher potency than naturally occurring polyphenols such as resveratrol (Farghali, Kemelo, & Canová, 2019). In synthetic origin, SRT1720 is chemically engineered to interact specifically with the SIRT1 enzyme‐substrate complex, thereby facilitating substrate deacetylation. Early studies emphasized its efficacy in rodent models of metabolic disease by demonstrating improvements in insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial respiration, and lipid homeostasis (Minor et al., 2011). This class of compounds has traditionally been evaluated for their anti‐aging, anti‐inflammatory, and metabolic regulatory properties, with several preclinical studies indicating that selective activation of SIRT1 can ameliorate hepatic steatosis and oxidative damage—a critical factor in liver diseases such as Non‐alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) (Chen, Lu, & Yang, 2025).

Therapeutic History:
SRT1720 has been extensively studied in preclinical animal models that mimic aspects of metabolic dysfunction associated with high‐fat diet feeding. Multiple studies have demonstrated that administration of SRT1720 in obese mice leads to significant reductions in hepatic lipid accumulation, improvement in mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and enhancements in overall energy metabolism (Minor et al., 2011). In rodent models, SRT1720 treatment has reduced markers of liver injury such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), suggesting an amelioration of fatty liver features that are characteristic of Non‐alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) (Minor et al., 2011). Although SRT1720 was originally explored with the aim of extending lifespan and improving metabolic parameters in models of obesity and type 2 diabetes, its effects on hepatic biology have drawn attention to its potential application in chronic liver diseases. The available literature shows that SIRT1 activators—both natural (like resveratrol) and synthetic (such as SRT1720)—have been associated with improvements in mitochondrial biogenesis, antioxidant defense, and lipid metabolism in liver tissues (Farghali, Kemelo, & Canová, 2019). Despite these promising biochemical and histopathological outcomes in animal models, no clinical trials to date have been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov for SRT1720 in the treatment of NASH (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), indicating that its clinical development for this specific indication remains at a preclinical stage.

Mechanism of Action:
SRT1720 functions as a pharmacological activator of SIRT1, leading to enhanced deacetylase activity on a range of substrates that are critically involved in metabolic regulation and mitochondrial function. At the molecular level, SIRT1 exerts its effects by removing acetyl groups from target proteins, thereby modulating their activity, stability, and localization. A primary focus of SIRT1-mediated deacetylation is the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). Deacetylation of PGC-1α by SIRT1 leads to its activation, which in turn promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and enhances oxidative phosphorylation efficiency (Chen, Lu, & Yang, 2025). This activation results in upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, notably including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), which are essential enzymes for shifting the hepatocellular energy balance towards increased β-oxidation of fatty acids. In addition to upregulating β-oxidation, SIRT1 activation under the influence of SRT1720 also contributes to the suppression of lipogenic transcription factors, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP). This downregulation of lipogenesis reduces the synthesis of new fatty acids, which is a central component of steatosis. Moreover, enhanced SIRT1 activity is associated with secondary deacetylation of other key regulators involved in oxidative stress and inflammation, including forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), thereby bolstering antioxidant defenses and mitigating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Chen, Lu, & Yang, 2025; Minor et al., 2011). This dual benefit of enhancing mitochondrial oxidative capacity while reducing oxidative stress has been observed in cellular assays, where treatment with SRT1720 increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption, ATP levels, and decreased markers of lipid peroxidation (Minor et al., 2011).

Expected Effect:
Based on the robust preclinical data and molecular insights, the application of SRT1720 in NASH is expected to yield multi-faceted improvements in hepatic metabolism. In NASH hepatocytes, where mitochondrial dysfunction, steatosis, and oxidative damage are prevalent, SRT1720 is anticipated to activate SIRT1 efficiently at sub-micromolar concentrations (EC₅₀ ∼0.16 μM). This activation will lead to deacetylation and subsequent activation of PGC-1α, a pivotal event that drives the transcription of genes encoding mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation enzymes such as CPT1A and MCAD (Chen, Lu, & Yang, 2025). Since PGC-1α is known to be abundantly expressed in hepatocytes and critical for maintaining mitochondrial biogenesis and functionality, its activation is expected to lead to an increase in the number and efficiency of mitochondria, thereby enhancing β-oxidation of fatty acids. This metabolic shift should result in the reduction of intracellular lipid droplets or steatosis within hepatocytes. Additionally, by promoting the deacetylation of transcription factors responsible for oxidative stress responses (for example, Nrf2 and FoxO1), SRT1720 is expected to decrease the levels of ROS and improve the overall redox balance in liver cells, ultimately reducing oxidative damage and inflammation (Minor et al., 2011; Hang et al., 2021). The improved mitochondrial function and enhanced antioxidant defenses are predicted to lower circulating markers of liver injury (e.g., ALT and AST), ameliorate hepatocellular injury, and improve insulin sensitivity in metabolic liver disease models—a combination of effects that directly addresses the pathophysiological features of NASH. Pharmacokinetic studies have further indicated that SRT1720 exhibits adequate liver exposure in preclinical species, and tolerability data suggest that dosing is safe in rodent models, thereby supporting the translational potential of this therapeutic candidate (Wan, 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
The cumulative preclinical data provide strong support for the potential of SRT1720 as a repurposed candidate for the treatment of NASH. One of the key strengths of SRT1720 is its robust mechanism of action: by pharmacologically activating SIRT1, it directly addresses multiple aspects of NASH pathophysiology, including mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative stress. The ability of SRT1720 to promote deacetylation of PGC-1α and subsequent upregulation of mitochondrial β-oxidation enzymes—such as CPT1A and MCAD—provides a rational basis for reducing intracellular lipid accumulation and restoring mitochondrial homeostasis (Chen, Lu, & Yang, 2025; Minor et al., 2011). In addition, the activation of antioxidant defenses via SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of factors like Nrf2 and FoxO1 contributes to lowering ROS levels and dampening inflammatory cascades that further exacerbate liver injury in NASH (Chen, Lu, & Yang, 2025; Minor et al., 2011).

From a therapeutic history standpoint, studies using SRT1720 have demonstrated an ability to reduce hepatic steatosis and improve mitochondrial function in high-fat diet models and acute liver injury paradigms (Minor et al., 2011; Farghali, Kemelo, & Canová, 2019). Although direct clinical evidence in NASH patients is lacking—as evidenced by negative findings in the registered clinical trial search—its preclinical success provides a compelling rationale for further investigation in this therapeutic area. This is further reinforced by comparative studies of other SIRT1 activators, such as resveratrol and natural polyphenols, that have shown benefits in reducing hepatic inflammation and improving metabolic profiles in NAFLD/NASH models (Nassir, 2020; Shi & Qi, 2023).

A notable strength of SRT1720 is its high potency and specificity for SIRT1 activation, with an EC₅₀ in the low micromolar range, which enables effective modulation of SIRT1 targets at relatively low doses. Additionally, its favorable pharmacokinetic profile in rodent models, which includes adequate liver exposure and a tolerable safety margin, further supports its potential for clinical development (Wan, 2021). The compound’s dual functionality in enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1α and mitigating oxidative stress through deacetylation of key transcription factors aligns well with the comprehensive therapeutic approach required for the multifactorial pathology of NASH.

However, several weaknesses and challenges remain. First, despite encouraging preclinical outcomes, clinical translation of SRT1720 has been hampered by a lack of human trial data specifically targeting NASH. Furthermore, discrepancies in bioavailability and long-term safety profiles between animal models and human subjects are potential hurdles that need to be addressed in subsequent studies. Another concern is that some earlier studies using SRT1720 have been conducted in models of acute liver injury or other metabolic diseases rather than chronic NASH, necessitating additional investigations in more specific and clinically relevant NASH models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, while the activation of SIRT1 is associated with multiple beneficial downstream effects, SIRT1 regulation is complex and tissue-specific, meaning off-target or dose-dependent adverse effects may limit its clinical applicability if not properly managed (Chen, Lu, & Yang, 2025).

In summary, SRT1720 exhibits a high degree of mechanistic plausibility for the treatment of NASH, primarily through its action as a SIRT1 activator that deacetylates PGC-1α and enhances mitochondrial β-oxidation while simultaneously bolstering antioxidant defenses. The preclinical data underscore its potential to reduce steatosis, lower oxidative stress, and improve hepatic mitochondrial function. Its synthetic origin allows for reproducible manufacturing and potential chemical optimization. However, the absence of clinical trial data in NASH-specific populations and the need for a better understanding of its long-term safety in humans are notable limitations. Overall, SRT1720 represents a promising drug candidate for repurposing in the treatment of NASH, and further targeted studies are warranted to validate its efficacy and safety in this indication (Minor et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2025; Farghali et al., 2019; Wan, 2021).
