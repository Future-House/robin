Proposal for Bempedoic Acid (Esperion Therapeutics)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Bempedoic acid is an orally administered, synthetic, first‐in‐class lipid‐lowering agent developed by Esperion Therapeutics. It was originally discovered through phenotypic screening strategies aimed at identifying compounds capable of inhibiting enzymes involved in lipogenesis, and it belongs to the class of ATP‐citrate lyase (ACLY) inhibitors. As a prodrug, bempedoic acid is selectively converted in the liver to its active CoA derivative by the enzyme very long‐chain acyl‐CoA synthetase 1 (ACSVL1), an enzyme expressed predominantly in hepatocytes and absent in skeletal muscle, thereby conferring liver specificity and limiting muscle toxicity common with other lipid‐lowering agents such as statins (Butera et al., 2024; Batchuluun et al., 2022). Chemically, it is a modified dicarboxylic acid derivative that, after activation, directly inhibits ACLY. This enzyme is a critical mediator that links carbohydrate metabolism to de novo lipogenesis by catalyzing the conversion of citrate to acetyl‐CoA and oxaloacetate, the former being a key building block for both cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. Historically, compounds modulating the ACLY pathway have been explored for their ability to impact dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome, and bempedoic acid represents the latest iteration in this therapeutic class with a demonstrated clinical efficacy for lowering low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) in patients with hypercholesterolemia (Biolo et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Bempedoic acid has a robust therapeutic history as a lipid‐lowering agent. It has been evaluated extensively in phase II and III clinical trials for its efficacy in reducing LDL‐C levels in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and in those with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, particularly among individuals who are statin‐intolerant (Penson et al., 2017; Ruscica et al., 2022). The agent consistently lowers LDL‐C by approximately 15–25 % with monotherapy and can achieve up to 38 % reduction when combined with ezetimibe. In addition, decreases in inflammatory markers such as high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP) have been documented, suggesting that bempedoic acid exerts beneficial anti‐inflammatory effects in addition to its lipid‐lowering activity (Yang, 2020). Although its primary clinical utility has centered on dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk reduction, preclinical studies have also demonstrated improvements in hepatic lipid profiles in rodent models. There is emerging evidence from early‐phase studies and registered trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023; Unknown Reference) that bempedoic acid may be repurposed to treat metabolic liver diseases such as non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by virtue of its ability to modulate hepatic lipogenesis. Thus, while bempedoic acid is already approved for lipid‐lowering in humans, its application to NASH is based on a growing body of preclinical evidence and early clinical insights which support its role in ameliorating hepatic steatosis and inflammation.

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of bempedoic acid is well characterized at the molecular level. Upon oral administration, the prodrug undergoes activation in the liver by ACSVL1 to form bempedoyl‐CoA, its active metabolite. Bempedoyl‐CoA competitively inhibits ATP‐citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby reducing the conversion of citrate to acetyl‐CoA in the cytosol (Biolo et al., 2022; Penson et al., 2017). Since acetyl‐CoA is the fundamental substrate for both cholesterol biosynthesis and de novo lipogenesis, its reduced availability leads to a decrease in intracellular cholesterol synthesis. Consequently, this reduction in cholesterol triggers a compensatory upregulation of LDL receptors on hepatocyte surfaces, which enhances the clearance of circulating LDL particles from the bloodstream (Butera et al., 2024; Yang, 2020).

Additionally, inhibition of ACLY results in lower production of acetyl‐CoA, which in turn decreases the formation of malonyl‐CoA—a critical intermediate required for fatty acid synthesis. Malonyl‐CoA also functions as a potent inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), the rate‐limiting enzyme necessary for transporting long‐chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for β‐oxidation. Therefore, by lowering malonyl‐CoA levels, bempedoic acid is hypothesized to relieve the inhibitory effect on CPT1, promoting enhanced mitochondrial β‐oxidation of fatty acids in hepatocytes (Butera et al., 2024; Unknown Reference). This dual action—reducing lipogenesis by limiting the supply of substrates and enhancing fatty acid oxidation (FAO) by disinhibiting CPT1—forms the biochemical basis for its potential utility in treating NASH. In preclinical rodent models of steatohepatitis, treatment with bempedoic acid has been associated with reduced markers of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and, in some models, fibrosis, supporting its mechanism of shifting substrate flux away from lipogenesis and towards β‐oxidation (Unknown Reference; Marrs & Anderson, 2020).

Expected Effect:
Given the central role of hepatic lipid accumulation in the pathogenesis of NASH, the expected effect of bempedoic acid in this context is to decrease hepatic steatosis and reduce the inflammatory milieu that contributes to disease progression. The primary hypothesis is that, by inhibiting ACLY, bempedoic acid will reduce cytosolic acetyl‐CoA levels and consequently lower malonyl‐CoA synthesis. Reduced malonyl‐CoA is anticipated to relieve CPT1 inhibition, thereby promoting mitochondrial β‐oxidation of fatty acids. Enhanced FAO should result in a decrease in hepatocellular lipid accumulation, alleviating the lipid‐induced cellular stress that drives inflammatory and fibrotic responses in NASH (Oleksii, 2020; Mohamed Anasdeen et al., 2024).

Furthermore, the anti‐inflammatory effects observed in lipid‐lowering trials—evidenced by reductions in hs-CRP—support the notion that bempedoic acid may mitigate the chronic low‐grade inflammation present in NASH, which is partially fueled by aberrant lipid metabolism (Biolo et al., 2022; Yang, 2020). In hepatocytes, the shift in substrate utilization away from lipogenesis toward β‐oxidation is expected to correct the metabolic imbalance. Key metabolic enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, including CPT1, are expressed in the liver, and their activity is critically regulated by malonyl‐CoA levels. Preclinical data suggest that, with adequate target engagement, bempedoic acid can decrease hepatic lipogenesis while enhancing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation gene expression (Unknown Reference; Susekov et al., 2021). This metabolic reprogramming is supported by biochemical analyses demonstrating decreased citrate flux into lipogenic pathways, with consequent improvements in hepatic lipid profiles and reductions in steatosis in animal models of NASH (Samsoondar et al., 2017; Tummala et al., 2022).

Importantly, while bempedoic acid has been primarily evaluated in clinical trials focused on dyslipidemia, its well‐established safety profile in humans, oral bioavailability, and once‐daily dosing regimen make it an attractive candidate for repurposing in NASH. The expected effect in NASH is thus a twofold improvement: a reduction in hepatic lipid content through decreased lipogenesis and an enhancement in mitochondrial lipid catabolism, both of which are critical for attenuating the progression of steatohepatitis toward fibrosis and cirrhosis (Unknown Reference; Butera et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Bempedoic acid presents several strengths that support its consideration as a promising therapeutic candidate for NASH. First, its mechanism of action is highly relevant to the pathophysiology of NASH. By inhibiting ACLY in the liver, bempedoic acid directly reduces the availability of acetyl‐CoA, a key precursor for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, thereby potentially blunting the process of de novo lipogenesis—a process that is pathologically upregulated in NASH (Biolo et al., 2022; Penson et al., 2017). Second, the consequential reduction in malonyl‐CoA levels, and the resulting disinhibition of CPT1, provide a compelling rationale for enhanced mitochondrial β‐oxidation. This shift in metabolic flux is critical because an increase in β‐oxidation can reduce hepatocellular lipid accumulation, mitigate lipotoxicity, and lower the inflammatory drive that promotes hepatic injury and fibrosis (Butera et al., 2024; Unknown Reference). Third, the clinical efficacy of bempedoic acid in lowering LDL-C and reducing hs-CRP in hyperlipidemia trials provides strong human safety and efficacy data that can be repurposed for NASH, a disorder where metabolic dysregulation is central to disease progression (Yang, 2020; Ruscica et al., 2022). Additionally, the liver‐specific activation minimizes muscle toxicity—a significant advantage over statins—and supports its use in a patient population that may already be burdened by multiple comorbidities (Susekov et al., 2021; Brandts & Ray, 2020).

However, there are several challenges and weaknesses that must be addressed. Although preclinical studies in rodent models have shown improved hepatic lipid profiles and reduced inflammatory indices, direct clinical evidence in humans with NASH is limited. Existing trials to date have focused on dyslipidemia rather than liver endpoints, and while the mechanisms are highly suggestive of benefit, definitive proof of efficacy in NASH through endpoints such as histological improvement in steatosis, ballooning, and fibrosis remains to be established (Unknown Reference). In addition, there may be translational challenges related to differences in hepatic lipid metabolism between rodent models and humans, which could moderate the therapeutic benefits extrapolated from preclinical studies (Marrs & Anderson, 2020; Oleksii, 2020). Furthermore, while its effects on the acetyl‐CoA/malonyl‐CoA/CPT1 axis are well supported by biochemical rationale, detailed mechanistic studies specifically measuring these intermediates in the setting of human NASH are sparse and warrant further investigation (Butera et al., 2024; Unknown Reference).

From a practical standpoint, the oral administration, favorable safety profile in lipid-lowering studies, and the potential for once-daily dosing are significant strengths that could expedite its clinical development for NASH. The repurposing of bempedoic acid for NASH would benefit from an accelerated development path given the unmet need in this patient population and the extensive preclinical data that supports its efficacy in modulating hepatic lipid metabolism (Wołowiec et al., 2024; Agarwala et al., 2021). Nonetheless, the lack of long-term outcome data in hepatic endpoints and the necessity of dose-ranging studies in a NASH-specific population are key weaknesses that must be overcome with additional clinical trials specifically targeting liver histology and metabolic endpoints associated with NASH (Unknown Reference; Samsoondar et al., 2017).

In conclusion, bempedoic acid exhibits a strong mechanistic rationale for repurposing in NASH therapy. Its inhibition of ACLY reduces hepatic acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA availability, which is hypothesized to relieve CPT1 inhibition and promote mitochondrial β-oxidation. In preclinical models, this shift in metabolic substrate utilization corresponds with improvements in hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis markers. Its established clinical safety profile, particularly in the context of hypercholesterolemia, together with its liver-specific activation and anti-inflammatory properties, underpin its promise as a candidate for NASH. However, further dedicated clinical research is needed to directly evaluate its efficacy on hepatic endpoints and to fully characterize its impact on the acetyl-CoA/malonyl-CoA/CPT1/β-oxidation axis in human NASH patients. With these considerations in mind, bempedoic acid is a compelling candidate with significant potential for repurposing toward NASH treatment—a hypothesis that merits rigorous clinical validation via targeted trials (Unknown Reference; Yang, 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of bempedoic acid for the treatment of NASH include its well-established mechanism—selective inhibition of ACLY leading to decreased acetyl-CoA availability, which not only reduces cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis but may also lower malonyl-CoA levels to promote mitochondrial β-oxidation—as well as its documented efficacy in lowering LDL-C and hs-CRP, which indicate secondary anti-inflammatory benefits. Its liver-specific activation also minimizes muscle toxicity, a common drawback of statins. Additionally, the availability of extensive safety data from large-scale lipid-lowering trials supports its potential for safe repurposing in metabolic liver diseases (Biolo et al., 2022; Butera et al., 2024; Yang, 2020). The obvious weakness lies in the current paucity of direct clinical data in NASH populations; the preclinical evidence, while promising, has yet to be fully translated into human trials with robust hepatic endpoints such as histological improvement, fibrosis regression, or long-term liver-related outcomes. There is also the need for further mechanistic studies focused on the exact changes in acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA levels, and CPT1 activity within human liver tissues in NASH (Unknown Reference; Mohamed Anasdeen et al., 2024). Overall, however, the strengths of bempedoic acid—its attractive pharmacokinetic profile, oral dosing, favorable safety record, and plausible mechanistic effects on hepatic lipid metabolism—strongly support further investigation and potential repurposing of this agent for NASH treatment. Future studies should focus on NASH-specific endpoints and mechanistic readouts, which will help to confirm its therapeutic benefit and define its role in the treatment paradigm for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (Marrs & Anderson, 2020; Unknown Reference).

In summary, bempedoic acid holds considerable promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for NASH due to its unique action on ACLY, which has the potential to favorably alter hepatic lipid metabolism by decreasing lipogenesis and enhancing fatty acid oxidation. While its established safety and efficacy in reducing LDL-C in hyperlipidemic patients provide a strong foundation, targeted clinical studies in NASH patients are essential to fully validate its role and to optimize its dosing, efficacy, and long-term outcomes in this challenging metabolic liver disease (Unknown Reference; Yang, 2020).
