Proposal for Metformin (generic)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Metformin is a synthetic biguanide first developed in the mid-20th century from the naturally occurring guanidine found in Galega officinalis (commonly known as French lilac) (Kothari et al., 2019). As a member of the biguanide class of compounds, metformin was discovered serendipitously while exploring agents with insulin-sensitizing properties and has since been employed as a first-line therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (Sebastiani & Bhat, 2015). The synthetic nature of metformin involves chemical modifications to the guanidine structure to improve bioavailability and reduce toxicity relative to earlier compounds, and it has become one of the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide due to its well-characterized pharmacokinetics (PK), cost-effectiveness, and favorable safety profile (Zhou et al., 2018). The class of biguanides, including metformin, has historically been used primarily for glycemic control by lowering blood glucose levels, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and reducing hepatic glucose output (Chiu et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Metformin’s established clinical history spans over six decades, during which it has been used extensively in diabetic patients to lower blood glucose levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce complications such as cardiovascular events (Sebastiani & Bhat, 2015; Zhou et al., 2018). Although originally approved for type 2 diabetes, metformin has been studied in a variety of contexts beyond glycemic control, including in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and even as an adjunct in oncology given its potential anti-cancer effects (Tacelli et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021). Importantly, multiple epidemiological studies have suggested that metformin use in diabetic populations is associated with a reduced incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), pointing to its potential utility in metabolic liver diseases (Snyder et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021). There is also a substantial body of preclinical evidence from rodent models demonstrating that metformin reduces hepatic steatosis, improves insulin sensitivity, and modulates pathways relevant to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis (Green et al., 2019; Pinto-García, 2025). Although metformin is not currently approved specifically for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), clinical trials evaluating its efficacy in NAFLD/NASH patients have been implemented (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016) and pilot studies in both adult and pediatric populations have suggested some biochemical and metabolic benefits, despite mixed results in terms of liver histology (Doycheva & Loomba, 2014; Prat & Tsochatzis, 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
Metformin exerts its primary pharmacologic effects by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a central cellular energy sensor that responds to changes in the AMP/ATP ratio (Sebastiani & Bhat, 2015; Ruan et al., 2023). At the molecular level, metformin entry into hepatocytes is mediated primarily by the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1); once inside the cell, it accumulates within mitochondria, where it partially inhibits complex I of the electron transport chain. This inhibition modestly increases the cellular AMP:ATP ratio, which in turn triggers AMPK activation (Zhou et al., 2018; Tacelli et al., 2018). Activated AMPK phosphorylates and inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA (Ahmad & Haque, 2024; Pinyopornpanish et al., 2021). Since malonyl-CoA acts as an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), its reduction by metformin relieves CPT1 inhibition, leading to enhanced transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for β-oxidation (Ahmad & Haque, 2024; Green et al., 2019). This sequence of events—increased fatty acid oxidation, reduced de novo lipogenesis, and improved insulin sensitivity—is foundational to the hypothesis that metformin can counteract the lipid accumulation characteristic of NASH (Pinto-García, 2025; Tacelli et al., 2018). In addition to its primary metabolic effects, metformin has been shown to suppress hepatic inflammation by modulating inflammatory cytokine production and inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-dependent pathways, further supporting its potential anti-NASH properties (Ahmad & Haque, 2024; Sebastiani & Bhat, 2015). Furthermore, metformin affects the gut microbiota, enhancing the production of short-chain fatty acids that may contribute to its systemic beneficial effects on metabolism and inflammation (Tacelli et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mode of action, the hypothesis posits that metformin, by activating hepatic AMPK, will lead to an increase in ACC phosphorylation, thereby decreasing malonyl-CoA levels and relieving the inhibition on CPT1. In NASH hepatocytes, this cascade is expected to enhance mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, thus reducing the accumulation of intrahepatic triglycerides and ameliorating hepatic steatosis (Ahmad & Haque, 2024; Zhou et al., 2018). Since elevated hepatic fat content is a central pathological feature of NASH, the anticipated outcome would include reduced liver fat content, improved liver enzyme profiles (such as decreased ALT and AST), and better insulin sensitivity – all of which have been observed in certain clinical and preclinical studies (Green et al., 2019; Pinyopornpanish et al., 2021). The protein targets in these pathways, including AMPK and ACC, are expressed at significant levels in hepatocytes, which supports the rationale that modulation of these targets by metformin would have a direct impact on fatty acid metabolism (Zhou et al., 2018; Sebastiani & Bhat, 2015). Additionally, epidemiological data that associate metformin use with reduced progression of NAFLD and lower incidence of HCC further reinforce the expected beneficial hepatic and metabolic outcomes in a NASH context (Snyder et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021). In vitro assays using primary human hepatocytes should demonstrate increased levels of phosphorylated ACC and enhanced fatty acid oxidation markers upon metformin exposure, which would correlate with decreased lipid accumulation in these cells (Ahmad & Haque, 2024; Pinyopornpanish et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Metformin emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for NASH based on its well-characterized mechanisms, extensive clinical use in T2DM, and supportive preclinical evidence. One of the primary strengths of metformin is its robust activation of AMPK, which plays a key role in regulating lipid metabolism and is directly implicated in the pathological process of NASH. By reducing hepatic malonyl-CoA levels and disinhibiting CPT1, metformin enhances β-oxidation, potentially mitigating hepatic fat accumulation—a central driver of steatosis in NASH (Pinto-García, 2025; Zhang et al., 2021). Preclinical rodent studies provide compelling evidence of reduced hepatic steatosis with metformin treatment, and epidemiological studies have linked metformin use with improved metabolic outcomes and lower rates of NAFLD progression and HCC in diabetic populations (Ahmad & Haque, 2024; Green et al., 2019).

Furthermore, metformin’s safety profile is a substantial advantage. It has been used for decades in millions of patients with diabetes with relatively few adverse events, which supports its rapid repurposing potential for NASH, a field that currently lacks many approved pharmacotherapies (Sebastiani & Bhat, 2015; Tacelli et al., 2018). The drug’s dosing regimens, known pharmacokinetics, and manageable side-effect profile further enhance its attractiveness as a candidate for systemic metabolic intervention in patients with NAFLD and NASH (Linden et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2018).

However, several weaknesses or challenges must be acknowledged. Although metformin improves systemic metabolic parameters and liver enzyme levels in many studies, the evidence for significant histological improvement in NASH is mixed. Several clinical trials have failed to demonstrate robust regression of fibrosis or steatohepatitis solely with metformin treatment (Snyder et al., 2018; Doycheva & Loomba, 2014). This discrepancy may be due in part to heterogeneous patient populations, differences in study design, and the possibility that metformin’s metabolic effects are more pronounced in early-stage NAFLD rather than in advanced fibrotic NASH. Moreover, while the mechanistic hypothesis is sound from a biochemical perspective, it remains uncertain whether these molecular pathways can be modulated sufficiently in a complex clinical scenario to result in marked histological improvements (Green et al., 2019; Pinyopornpanish et al., 2021).

Another consideration is that clinical studies often show modest weight loss and improvements in insulin sensitivity with metformin, which may indirectly benefit liver fat content; however, without significant weight reduction or additional targeted anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic interventions, the direct benefits on liver histology may be limited (Tacelli et al., 2018; Pinyopornpanish et al., 2021). Additionally, while metformin’s action on AMPK is well established, other molecular pathways contributing to NASH—for instance, those involving lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and hepatic stellate cell activation—may require combination therapy with other agents to achieve a comprehensive therapeutic effect (Okishio et al., 2020; Chiu et al., 2023).

In summary, metformin’s strong safety record, extensive clinical experience, and its multifaceted mechanism of action—including AMPK activation, inhibition of ACC, reduction of malonyl-CoA, and enhancement of CPT1-mediated fatty acid oxidation—support its potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for NASH (Ahmad & Haque, 2024; Zhou et al., 2018). The candidate is particularly attractive for early-stage NAFLD/NASH in patients with concomitant metabolic syndrome or T2DM, and its widespread clinical use facilitates rapid translation into larger multicenter trials (Pinto-García, 2025; Tacelli et al., 2018). However, given the modest improvements observed in liver histology in some clinical studies and the complex pathophysiology of NASH that may not be fully addressed by metformin monotherapy, further rigorous randomized controlled trials exploring combination therapies may be warranted. Overall, metformin remains one of the most promising repurposed drug candidates for NASH based on its biochemical rationale, preclinical efficacy, and proven clinical safety, but its application may be most effective when integrated into multifaceted treatment regimens targeting the broad spectrum of metabolic and inflammatory derangements in NASH (Pinyopornpanish et al., 2021; Green et al., 2019).
