Proposal for PXL770 (Mydicar)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
PXL770, also known as Mydicar, is a novel small‐molecule compound belonging to the class of direct AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators. It was developed by Poxel SA through iterative medicinal chemistry approaches aimed at identifying compounds that directly bind to the allosteric drug and metabolite (ADaM) site on the AMPK heterotrimer. PXL770 exhibits high specificity for AMPK complexes, particularly showing approximately 20‐fold greater potency for the β1 subunit compared to β2 isoforms (Romero et al., 2020). This selective profile is fundamental since the β1 isoform is predominantly expressed in rodent hepatocytes and is implicated in the regulation of lipid metabolism, whereas in humans, even though β2 isoforms are more abundant in hepatocytes, β1‐selective activation seems sufficient to modulate metabolic pathways without eliciting off-target cardiac effects. AMPK activators as a class have been explored in metabolic disorders owing to their role as master regulators of cellular energy homeostasis. Prior research in this class has targeted conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and fatty liver diseases by promoting beneficial shifts from anabolic to catabolic processes. PXL770’s mechanism, as a direct allosteric activator, distinguishes it from indirect AMPK activators such as metformin, ensuring a robust and targeted modulation of metabolic enzymes such as acetyl‐CoA carboxylase (ACC) (Romero et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of PXL770 and similar direct AMPK activators is rooted in extensive preclinical research and early clinical studies focused on metabolic conditions, including Non‐Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form, Non‐Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). Preclinical studies in rodent models of NASH demonstrated that PXL770 effectively activates AMPK in hepatocytes, leading to a cascade of beneficial effects including decreased de novo lipogenesis (DNL), reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation, and lower levels of liver injury markers such as ALT and AST (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, early-phase clinical trials (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019) have provided proof-of-concept evidence for target engagement in human subjects. In these trials, subjects with NAFLD or insulin resistance achieved plasma exposure levels considered sufficient for liver AMPK activation, which correlated with improvements in metabolic endpoints, such as enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced DNL as measured by stable isotope methodologies (Fouqueray et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). While PXL770 has not yet been approved for the treatment of NASH or NAFLD, its use in phase 1 and early-phase PK/PD studies, along with advances in understanding the utility of AMPK activation in metabolic regulation, underscores its promise as a therapeutic candidate. AMPK activators have also been evaluated in the context of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases, further supporting the rationale for repurposing them for NASH, where metabolic dysfunction and hepatic lipid overload play central roles (Anggreini et al., 2022; Fouqueray et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
PXL770 exerts its pharmacological effects by directly activating AMPK, an enzyme that acts as a cellular energy sensor and regulator of several metabolic pathways. Under normal physiological conditions, AMPK is activated by an increase in the AMP/ADP to ATP ratio, usually in response to energy deprivation. However, PXL770 bypasses the upstream energy-sensing events by binding directly to the ADaM site located at the interface between the catalytic α- and regulatory β-subunits of AMPK. This binding promotes a conformational change that enhances AMPK’s kinase activity (Romero et al., 2020). Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates key downstream substrates such as ACC. Phosphorylation of ACC results in its inhibition, leading to a marked decrease in the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA is a critical intermediate that not only serves as a substrate for de novo lipogenesis but also acts to inhibit carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), the enzyme responsible for transporting long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for β-oxidation. Consequently, the inhibition of ACC by AMPK activation with PXL770 reduces malonyl-CoA levels, thereby disinhibiting CPT1. This promotion of CPT1 activity enhances mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids, decreasing the lipid burden in hepatocytes, which is a hallmark of NASH (Chen et al., 2024; Anggreini et al., 2022).

At the molecular level, the effect of PXL770 is multifaceted. Besides the suppression of de novo lipogenesis, activated AMPK also modulates the expression and activity of several transcription factors and enzymes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. For example, AMPK can inhibit sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP), which are key regulators of lipogenic gene expression. This inhibition further contributes to decreased synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides in the liver. Additionally, AMPK activation has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects by modulating signaling pathways such as NF-κB, which reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the context of NASH, where inflammation and fibrosis are notable features, these anti-inflammatory properties could potentially ameliorate disease progression (Desjardins, 2023; Anggreini et al., 2022).

The biochemical intricacies involved with PXL770's mechanism have been corroborated by both preclinical biochemical studies and translational clinical PK/PD assessments. In liver biopsies from treated subjects, increased levels of phosphorylated ACC (p-ACC) have been observed, serving as a direct biomarker for AMPK activation. This biochemical evidence—manifested by the cascade from PXL770 binding to AMPK, through ACC phosphorylation, culminating in the biochemical shifts in malonyl-CoA and fatty acid oxidation—is central to the compound's therapeutic rationale in NASH (Fouqueray et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis driving the development of PXL770 for the treatment of NASH is that its direct activation of AMPK will lead to a reduction in hepatic steatosis and inflammation through a well-defined metabolic pathway. By phosphorylating and inhibiting ACC, PXL770 is expected to decrease intracellular malonyl-CoA concentrations, thereby releasing the inhibition on CPT1. This disinhibition is anticipated to enhance the mitochondrial uptake and β-oxidation of fatty acids, reducing the accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes—a central feature of steatosis in NASH (Anggreini et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2024).

In vitro assays conducted in primary hepatocytes have indicated that AMPK activation by PXL770 reduces markers of de novo lipogenesis, while in preclinical animal models, administration of PXL770 has resulted in a decrease in hepatic triglyceride levels, lower ALT and AST levels, and reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, improvements in insulin sensitivity have been reported, as measured by indices such as HOMA-IR and enhancements in oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) parameters, which are relevant because insulin resistance is a critical component of NASH pathogenesis (Fouqueray et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Given that hepatocytes in NASH patients exhibit impaired lipid oxidation and heightened de novo lipogenesis, the expected effect of PXL770 is twofold: first, by boosting mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, it should directly lower hepatic lipid content, thereby reducing steatosis; second, by exerting anti-inflammatory effects via downstream AMPK-dependent signaling, it should contribute to ameliorating the inflammatory milieu and potentially reducing fibrogenesis in the liver. This combinatorial action addresses both the metabolic and inflammatory dimensions of NASH pathology, potentially translating into improved liver histology and better overall metabolic health in treated individuals (Fouqueray et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of PXL770 as a therapeutic candidate for NASH is promising based on the convergence of robust preclinical and early clinical evidence that supports its mechanism of action and translational potential. One of the primary strengths of PXL770 is its direct activation of AMPK, which affords a high degree of mechanistic specificity. By directly engaging the ADaM site on AMPK, PXL770 bypasses the need for upstream kinase activation and delivers a more predictable and potent modulation of the pivotal metabolic enzyme. This specificity translates into a strong biochemical rationale for its use in NASH, where excessive de novo lipogenesis and impaired fatty acid oxidation are central derangements. The resultant effects on ACC phosphorylation, decreased malonyl-CoA production, and enhanced CPT1-mediated fatty acid oxidation have been confirmed in both animal models and early-phase clinical studies, where favorable changes in hepatic lipid profiles and insulin sensitivity have been documented (Fouqueray et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2024).

Furthermore, the clinical PK/PD studies of PXL770 have demonstrated sufficient plasma exposure to achieve target engagement in the liver, as evidenced by elevated p-ACC levels in liver biopsies, which bolster the translational credibility of the preclinical findings. The evidence that PXL770 not only reduces hepatic triglyceride accumulation but also improves systemic insulin sensitivity is particularly attractive, given the multifaceted nature of NASH pathogenesis, which involves both metabolic dysfunction and inflammatory processes (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019).

Despite these strengths, several challenges and potential weaknesses need to be addressed before advancing PXL770 further in clinical development for NASH. First, while early-phase studies have shown encouraging biochemical and metabolic improvements, longer-term clinical trials will be essential to determine whether these changes translate into meaningful improvements in liver histology, fibrosis, and clinical outcomes in NASH patients. The current data mainly focus on surrogate endpoints such as decreased DNL and improved insulin sensitivity, but definitive outcomes related to inflammation and fibrosis remain to be fully elucidated (Fouqueray et al., 2021). Second, systemic activation of AMPK, although desirable for correcting metabolic dysfunction, may potentially result in off-target effects in tissues other than the liver. However, PXL770’s preferential activation of the β1 isoform (which is more prominent in the liver in relevant preclinical models) may help mitigate this risk, although this remains to be assessed through comprehensive safety evaluations in larger, longer-duration trials (Romero et al., 2020; Mather et al., 2024).

Another consideration is the heterogeneity observed in clinical responses among NASH patients. Early studies have suggested that “DNL responders”—patients with more pronounced baseline metabolic dysfunction—might experience greater benefit from AMPK activation. This differential response underscores the need for biomarkers that can identify patient subgroups most likely to benefit from PXL770. Moreover, while the anti-inflammatory effects of AMPK activation are promising, the complexity of inflammatory signaling in NASH requires further investigation to fully define how PXL770 may influence pathways such as NF-κB and cytokine production over extended treatment periods (Anggreini et al., 2022; Fouqueray et al., 2021).

In summary, PXL770 presents a well-founded therapeutic candidate for NASH based on its direct AMPK activation, confirmed biochemical action on ACC and downstream metabolic pathways, and early clinical evidence demonstrating improvements in hepatic lipid handling and insulin sensitivity. The strengths lie in its mechanistic specificity, translational PK/PD alignment, and promising preclinical and phase 1b results. However, the true therapeutic value of PXL770 will depend on its ability to produce sustained histological improvements in NASH, an acceptable long-term safety profile, and identification of the patient populations most likely to benefit from its unique mode of action. Overall, PXL770 represents a promising candidate that merits further investment in clinical trials while carefully monitoring efficacy endpoints and potential systemic effects (Fouqueray et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Desjardins, 2023).
