Proposal for SR9009 (Cayman Chemical, Cat. #10013104)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SR9009 is a synthetic small‐molecule agonist originally designed to target the nuclear receptor REV-ERBα, an atypical ligand-regulated transcriptional repressor involved in circadian rhythm regulation and metabolic homeostasis. Chemically synthesized using modern medicinal chemistry and structure–activity relationship (SAR) approaches, SR9009 belongs to the class of REV-ERB agonists that have been extensively employed as chemical probes to study circadian biology, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory processes. Its design was intended to overcome the limitations of earlier REV-ERB modulators, such as GSK4112, by providing improved pharmacokinetic properties and potency in in vivo settings. The chemical structure of SR9009 allows it to bind within the ligand-binding domain of REV-ERBα, thereby inducing a conformational change that promotes the recruitment of nuclear receptor co-repressor complexes such as NCoR and HDAC3. This interaction results in transcriptional repression of target genes that are central to lipogenesis, inflammatory signaling, and circadian regulation. Historically, REV-ERB agonists like SR9009 have been used primarily as research tools to investigate the complex interplay between the circadian clock and metabolic gene regulation. In many rodent studies, these compounds have been shown to modulate energy homeostasis, reduce adiposity, and influence lipid profiles. The synthetic origins of SR9009, along with its established role as a tool compound in preclinical metabolic studies, underscore its potential for repurposing in diseases such as Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), where disruption of lipid metabolism and circadian rhythms are major pathological features (Griffett et al., 2020; Griffett et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of REV-ERB agonists centers on their use in experimental models of metabolic disease, obesity, and inflammation. Several preclinical studies have established that SR9009 can positively modulate metabolic profiles in rodent models. For instance, SR9009 treatment in models of diet-induced obesity has been associated with a reduction in body fat, decreased plasma triglycerides and cholesterol, and improvements in glucose tolerance. In mouse models of Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), SR9009 has demonstrated efficacy by reducing hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, as well as by ameliorating some of the underlying metabolic disturbances that drive disease progression (Griffett et al., 2020). Although direct human clinical studies are lacking—as evidenced by the absence of registered clinical trials for SR9009 in NASH (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—the robust preclinical data in rodent models provide a solid foundation for its further evaluation in liver disease contexts similar to NASH. In addition to metabolic improvements, preclinical studies have reported that REV-ERB agonists can suppress inflammatory gene expression and fibrogenic markers, which are crucial in halting the progression of NAFLD to NASH (Griffett et al., 2020; Raza et al., 2022). Previous investigations have also shown that REV-ERB activation can improve liver pathology via mechanisms that include the downregulation of fibrotic genes like TGFβ1 and Mmp13, as well as the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β. Collectively, the therapeutic history of SR9009 and related compounds in preclinical models underscores their potential as repurposed agents for NASH, especially given the multifaceted approach required to address metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrotic aspects of the disease (Griffett et al., 2020; Welch et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, SR9009 functions as an agonist of REV-ERBα, a nuclear receptor encoded by NR1D1 that plays a central role in regulating circadian rhythms, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory responses. REV-ERBα lacks a traditional activation function domain and acts predominantly as a transcriptional repressor. Upon binding to SR9009, REV-ERBα undergoes a conformational change that facilitates the recruitment of nuclear co-repressors such as NCoR and HDAC3, resulting in the suppression of target gene transcription (Griffett et al., 2022; Hong et al., 2021). This transcriptional repression affects a wide array of genes involved in lipogenesis and inflammatory signaling. For example, REV-ERB activation leads to the downregulation of genes such as Dhcr24, ApoE, and ApoC3, which play roles in cholesterol and lipid metabolism (Griffett et al., 2020). Additionally, REV-ERBα’s action on circadian regulators, such as Bmal1—whose expression is directly repressed by REV-ERBα—results in the synchronization of metabolic processes with circadian phases, thereby promoting a state of enhanced metabolic efficiency (Griffett et al., 2022; Hong et al., 2021).

The compound’s proposed mechanism in the context of NASH is particularly centered on its ability to enhance the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway. The hypothesis is that by activating REV-ERBα, SR9009 will upregulate key enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, such as Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and Medium-chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase (MCAD), thereby enhancing mitochondrial function and reducing hepatic steatosis. Although direct experimental evidence in hepatocyte models regarding the upregulation of CPT1A and MCAD upon treatment with SR9009 remains to be comprehensively documented in the excerpts provided, the mechanistic rationale is supported by broader studies indicating that REV-ERB agonism is associated with enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and increased oxidative metabolism (Crouchet et al., 2025; Welch et al., 2022). Moreover, animal studies have demonstrated that pharmacological activation of REV-ERB can improve systemic metabolic parameters, reduce inflammatory cytokine levels, and improve liver histology by reducing fibrosis, all of which are consistent with the anticipated downstream effects of enhancing β-oxidation and mitochondrial function (Griffett et al., 2020; Raza et al., 2022). The direct promoter occupancy of REV-ERBα on target genes in hepatocytes also further supports the notion that SR9009 modulates gene expression at the transcriptional level, contributing to its overall beneficial effects observed in rodent models of NASH (Griffett et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
The expected therapeutic effect of SR9009 in the context of NASH is multifaceted. In hepatocyte assays, the hypothesis is that SR9009 will enhance circadian regulation of lipid metabolism, leading to the upregulation of β-oxidation genes such as CPT1A and MCAD. This upregulation should, in turn, lead to improved mitochondrial function and increased fatty acid oxidation, thereby reducing intracellular lipid accumulation and alleviating hepatic steatosis (Griffett et al., 2020). In animal models, particularly diet-induced obese mice that mimic human NASH pathology, treatment with SR9009 has been associated with a reduction in liver fat, improved systemic metabolic profiles including lowered plasma triglycerides and cholesterol, and a decrease in markers of inflammation and fibrosis (Griffett et al., 2020). The compound is anticipated to exert its effects specifically in hepatocytes where REV-ERBα is highly expressed, as well as in hepatic stellate cells that play a central role in fibrosis. REV-ERBα’s circadian regulation ensures that the timing of gene expression is optimized for lipid processing and energy expenditure; therefore, SR9009 is expected to restore the rhythmic expression of metabolic genes and improve hepatic energy balance (Griffett et al., 2022; Hong et al., 2021).

Moreover, the anti-inflammatory properties of SR9009 are expected to contribute to the overall therapeutic effect. By repressing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNFα, and IFNγ, SR9009 should reduce inflammation in the liver—an effect that is crucial given the role of hepatic inflammation in the progression of NAFLD to NASH (Griffett et al., 2020; Welch et al., 2022). This dual action—improving mitochondrial β-oxidation while concurrently reducing inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways—positions SR9009 as a compound that targets both the metabolic and inflammatory derangements observed in NASH. The oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile observed in rodent models further support its feasibility as a therapeutic candidate, although clinical safety data in humans are not yet available (Griffett et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, the data support SR9009 as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NASH, based on its mechanism as a REV-ERBα agonist and its demonstrated preclinical efficacy. The strengths of SR9009 include its synthetic origin allowing for potent REV-ERB activation, a well-characterized mechanism of action that involves the recruitment of co-repressor complexes to suppress lipogenic and inflammatory gene expression, and its ability to modulate circadian rhythms which are intimately linked with metabolic homeostasis. The preclinical studies provide compelling evidence that SR9009 can reduce hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and improve metabolic parameters in rodent models, all of which are critical endpoints in NASH (Griffett et al., 2020; Welch et al., 2022). The hypothesis that SR9009 will upregulate β-oxidation enzymes such as CPT1A and MCAD, thereby enhancing mitochondrial function and alleviating hepatic steatosis, is supported by its general role in improving oxidative metabolism and energy expenditure in animal models (Crouchet et al., 2025; Welch et al., 2022).

However, several weaknesses must also be noted. First, despite its promising preclinical profile, SR9009 has not yet been evaluated in clinical trials for NASH, leaving a translational gap that needs to be addressed before widespread therapeutic application can be considered (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while SR9009 has demonstrable effects on reducing inflammatory markers and fibrosis in rodent models, some studies have shown limited efficacy in reducing hepatic steatosis, indicating that its impact on lipid accumulation may be complex and context-dependent (Griffett et al., 2020). Furthermore, potential off-target effects and the need for optimization in terms of potency and pharmacokinetic properties remain areas for further investigation. It is also critical to establish direct evidence for the upregulation of mitochondrial β-oxidation genes and improvement in mitochondrial function within hepatocytes, as current data are largely inferred rather than explicitly measured (Griffett et al., 2022; Raza et al., 2022).

In conclusion, SR9009 represents a promising candidate for NASH therapy due to its multifactorial mechanism of action that aligns well with the complex pathophysiology of the disease. Its ability to activate REV-ERBα and thereby enhance circadian regulation of lipid metabolism, reduce inflammatory signaling, and potentially upregulate key β-oxidation enzymes positions it as an attractive therapeutic agent. Preclinical studies have provided solid evidence for its efficacy in improving metabolic parameters and reducing hepatic fibrosis and inflammation in rodent models of NASH. Nevertheless, before advancing SR9009 into clinical trials, further studies are needed to confirm its molecular effects in hepatocytes—particularly concerning mitochondrial function and the expression of enzymes like CPT1A and MCAD—and to optimize its pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. These studies will be crucial in determining whether the promising preclinical findings can translate into effective and safe therapeutic outcomes for patients with NASH (Griffett et al., 2020; Welch et al., 2022). Overall, while SR9009 has several compelling strengths as a repurposed drug candidate for NASH, its clinical utility will ultimately depend on overcoming translational challenges and validating its efficacy in human studies (Griffett et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
