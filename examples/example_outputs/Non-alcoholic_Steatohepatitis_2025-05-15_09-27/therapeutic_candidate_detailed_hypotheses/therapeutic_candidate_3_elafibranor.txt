Proposal for Elafibranor (Genfit)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Elafibranor is a fully synthetic small‐molecule drug discovered and developed by Genfit that specifically functions as a dual agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) alpha and delta (PPARα/δ). It belongs to the broader class of PPAR agonists, a group of nuclear receptor modulators that has been extensively explored for their ability to regulate lipid metabolism, inflammatory responses, and insulin sensitivity. The compound was designed using rational drug design and synthetic organic chemistry methodologies in order to achieve a balanced activation profile on both PPARα and PPARδ without engaging PPARγ receptors, thereby avoiding the adverse effects (such as weight gain and edema) commonly encountered with thiazolidinedione drugs that selectively activate PPARγ (Choudhary et al., 2019). Its synthetic origin allows for precise modulation of its physicochemical properties, ensuring optimal oral bioavailability and metabolic stability, and this design strategy is consistent with other newly developed PPAR agonists used for metabolic and inflammatory disorders. This class of compounds has previously been deployed in the treatment of dyslipidemia with fibrates (which are PPARα agonists) and, more recently, in the management of metabolic syndrome; however, the dual PPARα/δ profile of elafibranor represents a novel approach intended to address the multifactorial metabolic perturbations observed in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, PPAR agonists have been evaluated in both preclinical and clinical settings for their ability to improve lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and inflammatory markers, and these effects have proven useful in diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. Elafibranor, in particular, has been the subject of multiple clinical trials for the treatment of NASH. In early-phase studies—for example, the Phase IIb GOLDEN-505 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2012)—elafibranor demonstrated the potential to induce resolution of NASH without worsening fibrosis in a subset of patients, with improvements noted in serum liver enzyme levels (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) and reductions in inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) (Boeckmans et al., 2019; Choudhary et al., 2019). Preclinical studies in rodent models of NASH have consistently shown that dual activation of PPARα and PPARδ by elafibranor leads to improved mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta-oxidation, resulting in reduced hepatocellular lipid accumulation and lower expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Perakakis et al., 2021; Todisco et al., 2022). Although encouraging signals were observed in these studies, subsequent large-scale Phase III trials (for example, NCT02704403; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016) failed to meet their primary endpoints for histological improvement, which led to a re-evaluation of the clinical potential of elafibranor in NASH (Mantovani, Byrne, & Targher, 2022; Nathani, 2023). Beyond NASH, PPAR agonists have been successfully repurposed for other metabolic disorders such as primary biliary cholangitis as evidenced by later developments; however, the evidence for elafibranor in NASH specifically remains mixed, despite promising early biochemical and histological responses (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Oseini & Sanyal, 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
Elafibranor exerts its therapeutic effect through dual agonism of PPARα and PPARδ, which are ligand-activated transcription factors predominantly expressed in the liver and other metabolically active tissues. The activation of PPARα is critical for the transcriptional upregulation of genes involved in peroxisomal beta-oxidation and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, such as acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), both of which contribute to increased catabolism of fatty acids and reduced hepatic lipid accumulation (Choudhary et al., 2019; Todisco et al., 2022). Concurrently, PPARδ activation enhances fatty acid oxidation in peripheral tissues, improves insulin sensitivity, and exerts anti-inflammatory effects through modulation of macrophage function and cytokine production (Zheng et al., 2023; Todisco et al., 2022). Mechanistic studies, including coactivator recruitment assays, have confirmed direct target engagement by elafibranor, triggering recruitment of transcriptional coactivators that further amplify the expression of downstream genes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), a regulator of gluconeogenesis and energy balance, thereby contributing to metabolic homeostasis (Perakakis et al., 2021; Choudhary et al., 2019). This coordinated activation results in a synergistic upregulation of mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, reduction in lipotoxic intermediates, and consequent attenuation of pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic signaling pathways implicated in NASH progression (Mantovani & Targher, 2022; Nathani, 2023). In addition, elafibranor’s receptor activation modulates key signaling networks that influence immune cell recruitment and cytokine release; for example, reducing the expression of IL-6 and CCL2, thereby mitigating inflammatory cascades in the liver microenvironment (Boeckmans et al., 2019). At the molecular level, the effective receptor binding (with EC₅₀ values of approximately 0.45 µM for PPARα and 1.3 µM for PPARδ) ensures that elafibranor robustly engages its targets at clinically achievable concentrations, reinforcing its capacity to modulate gene networks central to lipid oxidation and inflammatory resolution (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Choudhary et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
Based on preclinical data and early clinical trials, the expected effect of elafibranor in NASH is multifactorial. The primary anticipated outcome is a reduction in hepatocellular lipid load due to enhanced mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta-oxidation, facilitated by the upregulation of genes such as ACOX1, CPT1A, and PDK4. In vitro and in vivo models repeatedly demonstrate that activation of PPARα increases fatty acid oxidation and reduces steatosis in hepatocytes, while PPARδ’s action in peripheral tissues helps to ameliorate systemic insulin resistance and improve overall metabolic profiles (Perakakis et al., 2021; Todisco et al., 2022). In clinical assays, this mechanistic profile translates into reduced circulating levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST) and inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP), which are considered surrogate biomarkers of liver injury and inflammation in NASH patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2012; Boeckmans et al., 2019). Moreover, the resolution of histological features of NASH—namely steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning—has been observed in post hoc analyses, suggesting that elafibranor’s dual receptor activation may facilitate not only lipid lowering but also an improvement in the inflammatory microenvironment that drives cryptogenic fibrosis progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Mantovani & Targher, 2022). Given that hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells express relevant PPAR isoforms, elafibranor is expected to act on these cell types to reduce inflammatory signaling and potentially slow the fibrogenic cascade that leads to cirrhosis (Tacke & Weiskirchen, 2021; Boeckmans et al., 2019). Thus, the anticipated impact is a comprehensive improvement in liver histology and metabolic parameters, culminating in a decreased risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with NASH.

Overall Evaluation:
Elafibranor represents a conceptually robust therapeutic candidate for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, given its well-defined dual mechanism of action that targets both lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways (Choudhary et al., 2019; Todisco et al., 2022). One of the primary strengths of elafibranor lies in its dual PPARα/δ agonism, which is designed to simultaneously enhance hepatic fatty acid oxidation and improve systemic insulin sensitivity while also dampening inflammatory responses. This multifaceted activity addresses the complex pathophysiology of NASH where lipotoxicity, metabolic dysregulation, and chronic inflammation interconnect to drive disease progression (Choudhary et al., 2019; Todisco et al., 2022). The drug’s synthetic origin and selective receptor activation have enabled the development of an agent with desirable pharmacokinetic properties that support once-daily, oral administration—a key advantage in chronic diseases that require long-term management (Ahmed et al., 2024; Oseini & Sanyal, 2017).

From a historical perspective, early-phase clinical studies of elafibranor have shown promising biochemical improvements, including reductions in serum liver enzymes, inflammatory markers, and some degree of histological resolution of NASH features. These results come alongside supportive preclinical data in rodent models where dual activation of PPARα and PPARδ led to marked improvements in steatosis, decreased inflammatory cytokine profiles, and enhanced fatty acid oxidation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Perakakis et al., 2021; Todisco et al., 2022). However, a major challenge that has emerged in the clinical development of elafibranor is the inconsistency of its efficacy in larger pivotal Phase III trials, where the drug failed to meet the primary endpoint of NASH resolution without worsening fibrosis. This disparity between early promising data and later clinical outcomes suggests that while the underlying biochemical and molecular rationale is sound, the translational challenges inherent to the heterogeneous human NASH population may dilute the measurable clinical benefits (Mantovani & Targher, 2022; Nathani, 2023). Variability in patient selection, differences in disease stage (e.g., advanced fibrosis versus early steatosis), and the multifactorial drivers of NASH pathogenesis contribute to these challenges. Additionally, while elafibranor has a favorable safety profile with few PPARγ-related side effects, its modest efficacy when compared to approved treatments in other metabolic conditions remains a notable weakness (Boeckmans et al., 2019; Oseini & Sanyal, 2017).

Another consideration is the degree by which elafibranor modulates gene expression related to mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation. Functional studies demonstrating upregulation of markers like ACOX1, CPT1A, and PDK4 support the hypothesis that elafibranor improves fatty acid oxidation and overall energy homeostasis in hepatocytes. This molecular evidence, derived from both in vitro coactivator recruitment assays and animal models of NASH, underlines the mechanistic specificity of elafibranor’s action (Perakakis et al., 2021; Choudhary et al., 2019). Yet, despite this mechanistic precision, the extent of clinical efficacy necessary to induce meaningful histological reversal of NASH—especially in regard to fibrosis regression—remains to be conclusively demonstrated in large-scale trials.

In summary, elafibranor’s key strengths include its rational dual PPARα/δ targeting, a mechanism that is well supported by molecular and preclinical studies, and its favorable pharmacological profile that allows for convenient oral dosing and a low incidence of classical adverse effects associated with other PPAR modulators. Weaknesses that temper its promise include the mixed clinical trial outcomes, particularly regarding endpoints such as fibrosis improvement and overall NASH resolution, as well as the inherent challenges in translating improvements in metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers into consistent histological benefits across a diverse patient population. Therefore, while the mechanistic specificity and translational tractability of elafibranor are compelling—especially in light of its ability to modulate mitochondrial and peroxisomal gene expression and reduce hepatocellular lipid load—the overall clinical potential of elafibranor in NASH remains under question. Further studies may be needed to refine patient selection, optimize dosing regimens, and potentially explore combination therapies that can synergize with elafibranor’s biological effects to achieve robust, long-term clinical outcomes in NASH (Mantovani & Targher, 2022; Nathani, 2023; Boeckmans et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
In conclusion, as a candidate for repurposing in NASH, elafibranor offers a theoretically attractive intervention based on its dual receptor agonism mechanism, which enables simultaneous improvement in fatty acid oxidation and attenuation of inflammatory signaling. Its synthetic origin and design allow for a balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ, leading to expected beneficial effects such as reduced hepatic steatosis, improved mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta-oxidation, and a consequential decrease in the pro-inflammatory environment that drives fibrosis in steatohepatitis. However, the clinical history of elafibranor reflects a common challenge in metabolic drug development: the promising preclinical and early-phase clinical results have not consistently translated into robust histological improvements in later stage, larger-scale trials. Thus, while the mechanistic rationale is sound, further optimization—either as a monotherapy in well-characterized patient subgroups or in conjunction with other agents targeting complementary pathways—may be necessary to fully capitalize on its potential (Choudhary et al., 2019; Mantovani, Byrne, & Targher, 2022; Nathani, 2023).

Taking into account these factors, our team should consider continued preclinical investigations and carefully designed smaller-scale clinical studies aiming to better define the responsive patient population and to further elucidate dosing strategies that maximize efficacy while minimizing potential adverse effects. While elafibranor shows considerable promise from a mechanistic and biochemical standpoint, its clinical development trajectory underscores the need for additional work to convincingly demonstrate its capacity to not only modulate metabolic biomarkers but also to achieve meaningful and sustained histological improvements in NASH. This analysis supports a measured optimism for elafibranor as a promising therapeutic candidate for NASH with the potential for repurposing, though further evidence is required to justify large-scale investment in its development for this indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Boeckmans et al., 2019; Todisco et al., 2022).
