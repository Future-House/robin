Proposal for Empagliflozin (Boehringer Ingelheim)

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of empagliflozin as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with a focus on its potential to enhance hepatic β‐oxidation through mechanisms that include caloric loss, reduced substrate overload, AMPK activation, and improved mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Empagliflozin is a synthetic small‐molecule agent belonging to the sodium‐glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor class. This agent was originally discovered and synthesized by Boehringer Ingelheim with the primary intent of treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by selectively inhibiting SGLT2—a protein highly expressed in the proximal renal tubules that is responsible for reabsorbing glucose from the glomerular filtrate. The strategy behind the design of empagliflozin was to attain high selectivity for SGLT2 over related transporters, such as SGLT1, to achieve effective glycemic control via the induction of glucosuria, as has been demonstrated in numerous pivotal trials (Lai et al., 2020). In addition to lowering plasma glucose, empagliflozin produces beneficial ancillary effects including modest weight loss, reduction in blood pressure, and notable benefits for cardiovascular and renal outcomes. The extensive use of SGLT2 inhibitors in the management of T2DM and emerging insights into their pleiotropic metabolic actions have driven interest in their application to other metabolic conditions characterized by dysfunctional energy balance and lipid accumulation, such as non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive subset, non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Empagliflozin’s clinical history is rooted in its well‐characterized use as an anti‐diabetic agent. Over years of clinical use, large-scale trials have validated its efficacy in reducing hyperglycemia via an insulin-independent mechanism, with numerous studies also demonstrating reductions in body weight, improvements in blood pressure and favorable cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Although empagliflozin was not initially developed for liver diseases, preclinical studies in rodent models of NASH have revealed encouraging observations. In these studies, treatment with empagliflozin resulted in decreased hepatic steatosis and amelioration of histological features of NASH, including reduced inflammatory markers and fibrosis, along with concomitant activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Elseweidy et al., 2024). Furthermore, several clinical trials in diabetic populations have incorporated imaging endpoints such as MRI–proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) to quantify reductions in liver fat content when patients were treated with empagliflozin (Kuchay et al., 2018). Such evidence supports the evolving concept of repurposing empagliflozin in patients who present with non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis, even if the majority of early studies have been conducted in T2DM populations with accompanying NAFLD. Trials such as those indexed under ClinicalTrials.gov, as well as studies in non-diabetic patients with NAFLD (e.g., NCT04642261), further bolster the rationale behind exploring this drug for hepatic indications. The body of evidence, which combines outcomes from both clinical and preclinical studies, suggests that the safety profile established in T2DM, along with metabolic improvements driven by empagliflozin, may be leveraged for the treatment of NASH.

Mechanism of Action:
Empagliflozin exerts its primary pharmacological action via the inhibition of SGLT2 in the renal proximal tubule. By blocking SGLT2 function, empagliflozin decreases renal glucose reabsorption and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion, producing an insulin-independent reduction in blood glucose levels (Jojima et al., 2016; Lai et al., 2020). This glucosuric effect results in an unintended caloric loss which contributes to a state of negative energy balance. The reduction of circulating glucose and the associated caloric deficit are known to induce mild ketosis and shift substrate utilization away from carbohydrate oxidation toward increased reliance on fatty acids as an energy source. This metabolic shift is hypothesized to reduce substrate overload in hepatocytes—a key contributor to the pathogenesis and progression of NASH—by alleviating the lipotoxic stress that results from oversupply of carbohydrates (Dougherty et al., 2021).

On a molecular level, the mild ketosis and resulting energy deficit promote the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master sensor of cellular energy status that plays a pivotal role in regulating metabolic homeostasis. Once activated, AMPK enhances mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation while simultaneously inhibiting lipogenic pathways via downregulation of key transcription factors such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate-responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) (Chun et al., 2023; Androutsakos et al., 2022). The activation of AMPK leads to a cascade of beneficial metabolic effects including inhibition of de novo lipogenesis, stimulation of β-oxidation, improvement in mitochondrial function, and reduction in oxidative stress. Collectively, these molecular events contribute to a decrease in intracellular triglyceride accumulation and amelioration of hepatic steatosis—a central criterion in the diagnosis and progression of NASH. Moreover, some in vitro studies in hepatocyte-derived cell lines imply that empagliflozin might also positively modulate inflammatory signaling pathways and reduce detrimental protein O-GlcNAcylation in hepatocytes, providing an additional layer of hepatoprotection (Chun et al., 2023; Jojima et al., 2016). Thus, the mechanistic rationale for repurposing empagliflozin in NASH rests on its ability to systemically shift energy balance and promote metabolic processes that favor the breakdown of fatty acids, particularly through enhanced mitochondrial β-oxidation driven by AMPK activation.

Expected Effect:
Based on the detailed biochemical and clinical background, the hypothesis for empagliflozin in NASH is that it will improve hepatic β-oxidation in NASH hepatocytes indirectly through several interrelated mechanisms. First, by reducing blood glucose levels and promoting glucosuria, empagliflozin induces a negative energy balance that leads to caloric loss and a mild state of ketosis. This state inherently forces a metabolic shift wherein cells increasingly utilize fatty acids for energy rather than carbohydrates (Dougherty et al., 2021). In this framework, the decrease in substrate overload in hepatocytes is expected to alleviate lipotoxicity—a primary driver of hepatic inflammation, cell injury, and fibrosis in NASH. As the body compensates for the altered energy availability, activation of AMPK is anticipated; once activated, AMPK boosts mitochondrial β-oxidation by increasing the transcription and activity of enzymes required for fatty acid breakdown while simultaneously suppressing lipogenic enzyme expression (Kaur et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024).

In practical terms, imaging studies—such as those employing MRI-PDFF—have shown that empagliflozin treatment in diabetic patients correlates with reductions in liver fat content, providing indirect evidence for the hypothesized metabolic shift toward enhanced β-oxidation. This outcome is expected to manifest as improved hepatic histological features, including reduced steatosis, diminished inflammatory cell infiltration, and less hepatocyte ballooning, which collectively are surrogate markers of NASH improvement. Although the direct expression of SGLT2 in hepatocytes remains controversial, the metabolic benefits of empagliflozin are primarily derived from its systemic effects, thereby indirectly improving hepatic mitochondrial function. If these mechanisms are confirmed, empagliflozin could contribute not only to reduction of liver fat accumulation but also to an improvement in overall liver function and a potential retardation—or even reversal—of fibrosis progression in NASH patients (Kaur et al., 2023; Dougherty et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Our comprehensive evaluation of empagliflozin, based on the convergence of clinical, biochemical, and preclinical data, suggests that it is a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis. Among its strengths is the well-established efficacy and safety profile in type 2 diabetes populations over years of clinical use, which provides an extensive safety database that reduces the translational risk when repurposing it for NASH (Lai et al., 2020; Kuchay et al., 2018). The mechanistic rationale is robust: empagliflozin lowers plasma glucose via SGLT2 inhibition, inducing glucosuria and resulting in a negative energy balance that not only contributes to weight loss but also shifts substrate utilization toward fatty acids. Such a metabolic shift is crucial because it facilitates the activation of AMPK, triggering enhanced mitochondrial β-oxidation and thus reducing the hepatic lipid burden that is central to NASH pathology (Chun et al., 2023; Jojima et al., 2016). Additionally, preclinical studies have provided supportive evidence where rodent NASH models treated with empagliflozin displayed reductions in steatosis and improvements in inflammatory markers, which are consistent with the expected activity on hepatic β-oxidation (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Elseweidy et al., 2024).

The expected beneficial effects in patients include a reduction in liver fat content as measured by non-invasive imaging modalities such as MRI-PDFF, improvements in liver enzyme profiles, and potentially favorable histological improvements including reductions in hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation, and fibrosis. These effects are hypothesized to be mediated by the combination of reduced substrate overload, increased ketone body production, and the subsequent enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation—a pathway that could decisively counteract the development and progression of NASH (Dougherty et al., 2021; Kaur et al., 2023).

Nonetheless, some weaknesses and knowledge gaps remain. Notably, while many clinical studies have been conducted in T2DM populations with NAFLD and have demonstrated reductions in liver fat parameters, there is a relative paucity of large-scale, placebo-controlled, biopsy-driven randomized controlled trials solely targeting non-diabetic NASH populations. Histological endpoints remain the gold standard for evaluating NASH improvement, yet many studies have relied on surrogate imaging markers (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016, 2021). Moreover, while the systemic metabolic effects of empagliflozin are well understood, the extent to which these effects directly translate to enhanced hepatocyte β-oxidation at a molecular level requires further investigation. Direct measurements of mitochondrial function and specific assays of fatty acid oxidation in human liver tissue are still limited, thereby underscoring the need for additional mechanistic studies.

Another potential limitation is the indirect nature of the drug’s hepatic actions. Since SGLT2 is primarily expressed in renal tissue, the beneficial hepatic effects of empagliflozin are mediated via systemic metabolic shifts rather than through direct receptor engagement in hepatocytes. This proposition implies that while the drug can reduce hepatic substrate overload, its efficacy might vary among individuals based on differences in metabolic status, degree of insulin resistance, and baseline liver fat content (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Hüttl et al., 2021). Variability in patient populations and the presence of concomitant therapies may also confound outcomes, necessitating careful patient selection and robust study designs in forthcoming trials.

Given these strengths and limitations, our overall evaluation is cautiously optimistic. Empagliflozin’s well-documented metabolic benefits, supported by a favorable long-term safety profile in T2DM, position it as a strong candidate for repurposing in NASH. The combined effects—ranging from improved glycemic control and weight loss to the activation of AMPK and subsequent enhancement of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation—form a coherent and plausible mechanistic framework that addresses central features of NASH pathophysiology. This multifaceted approach could potentially allow empagliflozin to not only reduce hepatic steatosis but also to improve inflammation and possibly retard fibrosis progression, thereby impacting several dimensions of the disease process (Kaur et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024).

In conclusion, while the evidence to date is encouraging, the transition from T2DM populations with concurrent NAFLD to broader NASH indications—especially in non-diabetic individuals— requires more rigorous clinical trials with biopsy-proven endpoints and longer-term follow-up. Future studies should incorporate detailed mechanistic investigations to directly assess changes in hepatic mitochondrial function and β-oxidation rates and should ideally stratify patients based on metabolic phenotype to better predict response. Nevertheless, based on the confluence of preclinical data, early-phase clinical trials, and robust safety information, empagliflozin emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate in the quest to address the significant unmet medical need in NASH treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kaur et al., 2023; Liu, 2024).

Overall, our comprehensive literature review supports the hypothesis that empagliflozin, through its established mechanism of promoting glycosuria-induced caloric loss and subsequent activation of metabolic pathways (notably through AMPK activation), can shift energy utilization toward enhanced fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes. This effect, in turn, may alleviate hepatic steatosis, reduce inflammation, and ultimately improve histological features of NASH. Although current evidence predominantly arises from diabetic populations and surrogate markers, the confluence of promising preclinical data and early clinical signals justifies the continued investigation of empagliflozin in large-scale, well-controlled trials targeting both diabetic and non-diabetic NASH populations. If ensuing studies confirm these preliminary findings, empagliflozin could represent a significant breakthrough in the pharmacotherapy of NASH, providing clinicians with a repurposed drug candidate that addresses both metabolic dysregulation and liver pathology, thereby fulfilling a critical unmet need in this challenging disease space (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kaur et al., 2023; Liu, 2024).

In summary, the strengths of empagliflozin for NASH treatment lie in its multifactorial metabolic actions—it lowers plasma glucose, induces a mild ketogenic state that favors fatty acid oxidation, promotes weight loss, and possesses robust cardiovascular and renal benefits—all of which are particularly valuable in the context of metabolic liver disease. However, the current limitations include a reliance on data from diabetic cohorts, an indirect mechanism of action on the liver, and incomplete direct evidence linking its use to enhanced hepatocyte β-oxidation in humans. Addressing these gaps through future rigorous clinical and mechanistic studies will be critical in determining whether empagliflozin can ultimately be approved as a therapeutic intervention for NASH. Based on the available evidence and our integrated evaluation, we remain cautiously optimistic and recommend that empagliflozin be advanced into further investigation as a repurposed treatment candidate for NASH.
