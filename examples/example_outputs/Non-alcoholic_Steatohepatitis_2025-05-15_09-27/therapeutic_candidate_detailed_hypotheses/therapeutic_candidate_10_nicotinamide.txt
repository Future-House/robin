Proposal for Nicotinamide Riboside (NR, ChromaDex Niagen)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a naturally occurring derivative of vitamin B3 that functions as an NAD⁺ precursor and was originally identified in cow milk and other dietary sources (Biţă et al., 2023). NR can be synthesized chemically and enzymatically, with recent advances producing more stable forms (e.g., borate-stabilized NR) that improve its shelf-life while ultimately delivering the active compound once ingested (Mehmel et al., 2020; Milisav & Poljsak, 2018). As a member of the NAD⁺ precursor class, NR has historically been used both as a nutraceutical to improve metabolic health and as a research tool to study the roles of NAD⁺ in aging, inflammation, and mitochondrial function (Biţă et al., 2023; Mehmel et al., 2020). Its classification in this group places it alongside other vitamin B3 compounds such as nicotinic acid (NA) and nicotinamide (NAM), but NR has gained particular attention because it elevates NAD⁺ levels without the dose-limiting side effects (e.g., flushing) associated with NA, establishing it as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for metabolic diseases (Trammell et al., 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Over the past decade, NR supplementation has been the focus of extensive biochemical, preclinical, and early-phase clinical studies, particularly in the context of aging, metabolic syndrome, and mitochondrial dysfunction (Conze et al., 2019; Mehmel et al., 2020). In animal models, NR has been shown to increase NAD⁺ levels in various tissues, leading to improvements in mitochondrial function, enhanced β-oxidation, and beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and inflammation, which are critical parameters in metabolic disease states (Braidy et al., 2019; Mehmel et al., 2020). More recently, early-phase clinical trials in subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have demonstrated that NR supplementation—often administered in combination with other metabolic cofactors such as L-carnitine and N-acetylcysteine—can decrease liver fat content and modulate systemic metabolic biomarkers with an excellent safety and tolerability profile (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019; Dollerup et al., 2018). Although direct clinical trials in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remain limited, the preclinical evidence in rodent models of NAFLD and early human studies indicate promising translational potential for NR in the treatment of NASH, a more advanced form of fatty liver disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, NR functions primarily by serving as a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺), a coenzyme that is essential for redox reactions and for the activity of a number of NAD⁺-dependent enzymes (Mehmel et al., 2020; Trammell et al., 2016). Once administered, NR is phosphorylated by nicotinamide riboside kinases (NRK1 and NRK2) into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which is then converted into NAD⁺ via NMN adenylyltransferases. The resultant elevation in intracellular NAD⁺ levels activates sirtuins, particularly SIRT1 and SIRT3, which are responsible for the deacetylation of key metabolic regulators such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) (Biţă et al., 2023; Braidy et al., 2019). SIRT1 activation promotes fatty acid β-oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis through deacetylation of PGC-1α, while SIRT3 activation enhances mitochondrial enzyme activity leading to improved oxidative phosphorylation and a reduction in oxidative stress (Biţă et al., 2023; Mehmel et al., 2020). Furthermore, the increase in NAD⁺ also supports other antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, thereby reducing hepatic inflammation—a central component in the pathogenesis of NASH (Braidy et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2022). These molecular interactions collectively enhance mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, leading to decreased lipid accumulation and amelioration of metabolic stress in hepatocytes (Biţă et al., 2023; Mehmel et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the context of NASH, it is hypothesized that NR supplementation will elevate hepatic NAD⁺ pools sufficiently to activate SIRT1 and SIRT3 pathways, thereby enhancing mitochondrial function and β-oxidation capacity in hepatocytes (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; Dollerup et al., 2018). The expected effect is that increased NAD⁺ levels will promote the deacetylation of PGC-1α via SIRT1, leading to the transcriptional upregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Simultaneously, SIRT3 will deacetylate and activate mitochondrial enzymes directly involved in oxidative phosphorylation, thereby enhancing energy production and reducing the accumulation of lipid intermediates (Mehmel et al., 2020; Braidy et al., 2019). These biochemical events should reduce hepatic steatosis, lower circulating inflammatory markers, and attenuate fibrosis by directly affecting the activation state of hepatic stellate cells, which are key drivers of fibrogenesis in NASH (Pham et al., 2019; Dollerup et al., 2018). Based on preclinical data, NR is also expected to increase whole-body energy expenditure, which can contribute to weight loss and improved lipid profiles—factors that would be beneficial in mitigating NASH progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019; Pham et al., 2019). Given that sirtuin expression is documented in hepatocytes and that mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of NASH pathology, the proposed mechanism aligns well with the therapeutic needs of patients with advanced metabolic liver disease (Biţă et al., 2023; Mehmel et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
NR presents a compelling therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NASH based on its well-established mechanism of elevating NAD⁺ levels, activating SIRT1/SIRT3, and enhancing mitochondrial function and β-oxidation in metabolically active tissues (Biţă et al., 2023; Mehmel et al., 2020). One of the main strengths of NR is its robust safety profile, as confirmed by multiple clinical studies that demonstrate good tolerability even at relatively high doses, and its longstanding use as a dietary supplement supports its rapid translation into clinical settings (Airhart et al., 2017; Conze et al., 2019). Furthermore, preclinical studies consistently show that NR can reduce hepatic steatosis and fibrosis markers in models of diet-induced liver disease, which is highly encouraging for NASH indications (Pham et al., 2019; Dollerup et al., 2018).

However, several weaknesses must also be considered. Although the mechanistic rationale is strong, human clinical efficacy data in NASH patients remain limited, and some trials in related metabolic conditions (e.g., NAFLD) have shown improvements in metabolic biomarkers rather than clear-cut clinical benefits (Dollerup et al., 2018; Damgaard & Treebak, 2023). Additionally, the tissue-specific distribution of NAD⁺ after oral NR administration may present challenges, as certain tissues such as skeletal muscle might not experience the same degree of NAD⁺ elevation as others, and the liver-specific pharmacodynamics require further elucidation in the NASH context (Damgaard & Treebak, 2023; Mehmel et al., 2020). It is also important to note that while NR has been shown to favorably modulate inflammation and oxidative stress in preclinical models, the translation of these effects into sustained clinical improvements in liver histology and function in NASH patients has yet to be definitively demonstrated (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024).

In summary, NR has a strong mechanistic basis and an established safety profile that support its candidacy for repurposing as a therapeutic agent in NASH. Its ability to elevate NAD⁺ levels, activate key metabolic regulators like SIRT1 and SIRT3, improve mitochondrial function, and reduce inflammatory and fibrotic markers aligns well with the pathophysiology of NASH. The preclinical evidence, coupled with early-phase clinical data in related metabolic liver diseases, is promising. However, the overall efficacy in NASH specifically remains to be conclusively proven in larger, well-powered clinical trials that focus directly on liver outcomes. Given its strengths and the potential to accelerate clinical translation due to its established safety, NR is a promising candidate, though further targeted studies are necessary to fully validate its therapeutic impact in patients with NASH (Biţă et al., 2023; Dollerup et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024).
