Proposal for Saroglitazar (Zydus Cadila)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Saroglitazar is a novel, synthetic small‐molecule drug belonging to the class of dual PPARα/γ agonists. Initially synthesized and developed by Zydus Cadila within India, it was designed to combine the lipid‐lowering effects of PPARα agonism with the insulin‐sensitizing benefits of PPARγ activation. Its chemical structure is distinct from other glitazars, lacking the classic glitazone moiety, and instead incorporating a unique pyrrole component and aryl alkoxy propionic acid scaffold that gives it a favorable receptor binding profile (Kaul et al., 2019). This compound belongs to the glitazar class—a group of dual agonists that have been investigated in the past for dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. Historically, agents of this class have aimed to simultaneously ameliorate hypertriglyceridemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus by targeting both PPARα and PPARγ, although many earlier candidates were halted due to safety concerns. Saroglitazar stands apart by demonstrating potent PPARα activity with an EC50 around 3 nM and moderate PPARγ activity with an EC50 around 38 nM, a balance that underlies its improved safety and efficacy profile compared to earlier dual agonists (Choudhary et al., 2019; Honda et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Saroglitazar was primarily developed and approved in India for diabetic dyslipidemia. Its clinical history includes extensive real‐world evidence and several Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials aimed at metabolic conditions and liver diseases such as non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form, non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Preclinical studies in rodent models of NASH have consistently demonstrated that saroglitazar decreases hepatic steatosis, reduces inflammatory markers, and attenuates fibrotic progression—outcomes that have been confirmed by both biochemical markers (e.g. reduced ALT and AST levels) and histological improvements (Akbari et al., 2021). In clinical settings, trials such as NCT03061721, NCT03863574, and NCT04193982 have provided promising outcomes in patients with NAFLD/NASH, showing improvements in liver enzymes, lipid profiles, and non‐invasive imaging endpoints like MRI‐proton density fat fraction (MRI‐PDFF) (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017, 2019, 2021). In addition, observational real‐world studies in patients with diabetic dyslipidemia and NAFLD have reported significant reductions in triglycerides and enhancements in glycemic control, alongside improvements in surrogate markers of liver fibrosis and steatosis (Goyal et al., 2020; Kaul et al., 2019). While the drug is not yet globally approved for NASH, its established use in diabetic dyslipidemia and accumulating clinical evidence supporting benefits in hepatic parameters provide a robust basis for further repurposing towards NASH treatment.

Mechanism of Action:
Saroglitazar exerts its therapeutic effects through dual activation of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptors (PPARs), specifically PPARα and PPARγ. At the molecular level, PPARα is largely expressed in hepatocytes, where its activation upregulates genes involved in β‐oxidation—such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and acyl‐CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1)—thereby promoting the oxidation of fatty acids, reducing triglyceride synthesis, and mitigating lipid accumulation in the liver (Honda et al., 2021; Choudhary et al., 2019). This increased β‐oxidation is critical in reducing the hepatic lipid burden that contributes to steatosis in NASH. Meanwhile, PPARγ is highly expressed in adipose tissue and, to a lesser extent, in the liver; its activation increases insulin sensitivity and stimulates adiponectin production. Adiponectin enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, decreases inflammatory signaling, and indirectly contributes to decreased hepatic fibrosis by modulating stellate cell activation (Jain et al., 2018; Lange et al., 2022). Structural studies have revealed that saroglitazar’s binding induces a conformational change in the ligand binding domain of both receptors, stabilizing the activation function‐2 (AF‐2) helix required for the recruitment of coactivator proteins, thereby enhancing transcription of target genes (Honda et al., 2021). Preclinical investigations further indicate that saroglitazar’s dual action not only decreases the hepatic lipid load but also exerts anti‐inflammatory and antifibrotic effects, likely by downregulating proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF‐α, IL‐6, and transforming growth factor‐beta (TGF‐β), and modulating adipocytokine profiles (Akbari et al., 2021; Jain et al., 2018). The dual‐receptor mechanism is particularly relevant in the context of NASH, where both steatosis and inflammation contribute synergistically to disease progression.

Expected Effect:
In the context of a comprehensive assay for NASH, saroglitazar is expected to yield multiple beneficial effects. Primarily, due to PPARα activation, there should be an increase in hepatic fatty acid β‐oxidation, evidenced by upregulation of genes such as CPT1A and ACOX1, leading to a reduction in the intrahepatic triglyceride pool. This is anticipated to decrease liver fat content as measured by imaging modalities such as MRI‐PDFF, as observed in previous clinical trials (Gawrieh et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). Secondly, PPARγ engagement is expected to improve systemic insulin sensitivity, reduce hyperglycemia, and increase circulating adiponectin levels; these changes should help modulate inflammatory signaling pathways that contribute to hepatocyte injury and fibrosis (Jain et al., 2018; Lange et al., 2022). Together, these mechanisms will not only reduce the hepatocyte lipid burden but also attenuate downstream inflammation and fibrogenesis. In cellular assays using hepatocyte cultures and co‐cultures with stellate cells, one would expect to detect decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF‐α, IL‐6) and fibrotic markers (e.g., collagen I, α‐SMA) upon treatment with saroglitazar, in line with reported preclinical data (Akbari et al., 2021; Jain et al., 2018). Moreover, improvements in liver enzymes (ALT, AST) would be anticipated in clinical biochemical panels, correlating with a reduction in hepatocellular damage (Roy et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2020). The coordinated action of improving lipid metabolism and enhancing insulin sensitivity provides a logical mechanistic rationale for the expected clinical benefits in NASH patients.

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, saroglitazar presents a compelling therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NASH based on its dual PPARα/γ agonism. Its strength lies in its ability to address multiple pathogenic mechanisms in NASH simultaneously: by activating PPARα, it enhances fatty acid oxidation and reduces hepatic lipid accumulation; by engaging PPARγ, it improves insulin sensitivity and reduces inflammation through increased adiponectin production. The combination of these effects has been validated in both preclinical animal models and early clinical studies, which have demonstrated decreased steatosis, inflammation, and markers of fibrosis, along with improvements in liver enzymes and metabolic parameters (Akbari et al., 2021; Gawrieh et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021).

Strengths of saroglitazar include its robust molecular mechanism, well‐documented preclinical efficacy, and promising clinical data, particularly in improving biochemical markers such as ALT and AST and addressing metabolic dyslipidemia. Its dual specificity with a strong PPARα component and moderated PPARγ activity seems to achieve a balance that minimizes some of the adverse events observed with pure PPARγ agonists like weight gain and edema (Choudhary et al., 2019; Honda et al., 2021). Additionally, the fact that it is already approved for diabetic dyslipidemia in India and has a good safety record in that indication lends further support to its potential repurposing for NASH (Goyal et al., 2020; Rajesh et al., 2022).

However, several weaknesses or challenges must be considered. The global regulatory acceptance for NASH treatment remains pending, and more extensive Phase 3 and long‐term safety studies are necessary to ascertain its efficacy, particularly histological improvements in liver fibrosis and clinical outcomes such as progression to cirrhosis. Furthermore, while the dual action mechanism is promising, the moderate activation of PPARγ might result in suboptimal insulin‐sensitizing effects compared to stronger agonists used in controlled settings, making it critical to identify the correct dosing regimen that optimizes both lipid and glucose metabolic outcomes without tipping the balance toward adverse side effects (Lange et al., 2022; Sharma et al., 2020). Lastly, the majority of clinical evidence arises from Indian real‐world studies and relatively small randomized trials, so multicenter, multinational studies with larger patient populations and longer follow‐up periods are essential to solidify its therapeutic potential in diverse populations (Roy et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021).

In conclusion, based on comprehensive review of biochemical, clinical, and mechanistic literature, saroglitazar offers a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for NASH. Its dual PPARα/γ activity is mechanistically well‐aligned with the pathophysiology of NASH—enhancing fatty acid oxidation and improving insulin sensitivity while reducing inflammatory and fibrotic signaling pathways. The preclinical evidence, coupled with emerging positive clinical data, supports the hypothesis that saroglitazar will reduce hepatocyte lipid burden and improve both biochemical and histological parameters in NASH patients. Nonetheless, further large‐scale, controlled trials with comprehensive safety and efficacy endpoints are warranted before its definitive role in NASH therapy can be established. The strengths in its molecular design and early clinical performance are balanced by the need for additional data to mitigate potential risk and optimize therapeutic dosing in the complex metabolic environment of NASH (Akbari et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020).
