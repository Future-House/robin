Proposal for Resmetirom (MGL-3196, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Resmetirom, also known by its research code MGL-3196 and developed by Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, is a synthetic small-molecule agent that belongs to the class of selective thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRβ) agonists. Its development originated from efforts to harness the metabolic benefits of thyroid hormone signaling specifically in the liver while minimizing the adverse systemic effects associated with non-selective thyroid hormone therapies (Alkhouri, 2020). The compound was designed using state-of-the-art medicinal chemistry and high-throughput screening strategies to achieve high selectivity for the THRβ isoform, which is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes, by achieving an approximate 28-fold selectivity over THRα (Levien & Baker, 2025). While early candidates in this class emerged from investigations aimed at treating dyslipidemia and obesity, Resmetirom stands out because of its ability to drive mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and reduce hepatic triglyceride levels. In the discovery phase, its synthesis was driven by the need to develop a receptor subtype–selective modulator that could exploit the liver’s natural reliance on THRβ for regulating cholesterol metabolism, bile acid synthesis, and mitochondrial biogenesis. This synthetic approach underlines the compound’s natural origins in classical thyroid hormone biology while taking advantage of modern drug design strategies to avoid systemic thyrotoxicosis and cardiorespiratory toxicity (Alkhouri, 2020; Lin et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
The conceptual basis of employing thyroid hormone mimetics to treat metabolic liver diseases has a long-standing precedent in preclinical biochemical and animal model studies. Early studies using non-selective thyroid hormones, such as T3, demonstrated potent effects in decreasing hepatic steatosis by reducing lipogenic gene expression and upregulating mitochondrial β-oxidation enzymes, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT1) (Kowalik, Columbano, & Perra, 2018). However, the clinical utility of native thyroid hormones was hampered by off-target effects, such as tachycardia, bone loss, and cardiac hypertrophy, primarily mediated by THRα. To overcome these limitations, selective THRβ agonists were developed, and among them, Resmetirom has been extensively explored in both Phase II and Phase III clinical trials in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) as well as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Clinical studies, such as those identified by ClinicalTrials.gov (2016; 2019a; 2019b; 2021), have demonstrated that Resmetirom not only reduces hepatic fat content as measured by imaging techniques (MRI-PDFF) but also improves liver enzymes and noninvasive fibrosis biomarkers (Hasan et al., 2025; Karim & Bansal, 2023). Its history in clinical development solidifies its potential role in repurposing and treating NASH—a disease with high unmet need and no approved pharmacologic interventions prior to its investigation. Moreover, its use in dyslipidemia provided preliminary evidence of favorable lipid-lowering effects and metabolic improvements, which further supported the rationale to evaluate it for NASH, a condition characterized by severe steatosis, hepatocellular inflammation, and progressive fibrosis (Karim & Bansal, 2023; Harrison et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
Resmetirom’s mechanism of action is driven by its selective activation of THRβ in hepatocytes. At the molecular level, once Resmetirom binds to THRβ, it induces conformational changes that promote recruitment of coactivators and subsequent transcriptional upregulation of target genes. These target genes include those involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation pathways, notably CPT1A (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A) and DIO1 (type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase) (Sinha et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2022). CPT1A is critical for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria, thereby enabling β-oxidation, while DIO1 catalyzes the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to the active triiodothyronine (T3), further sustaining thyroid hormone signaling within the liver. This dual upregulation leads to an enhanced mitochondrial metabolic rate, increased oxygen consumption, and improved fatty acid catabolism. Preclinical studies in animal models of high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis have shown that treatment with Resmetirom leads to significant improvements in mitochondrial function, which correlates with a reduction in hepatic lipid accumulation (Ramanathan et al., 2023; Karim & Bansal, 2023). Furthermore, selective activation of THRβ avoids stimulating THRα, minimizing the cardiovascular and skeletal adverse effects that are typically associated with non-selective thyroid hormones. Additionally, Resmetirom’s liver-targeted uptake via transporters such as OATP1B1 ensures its predominant localization in hepatocytes, which is critical for achieving the desired therapeutic metabolic effects (Levien & Baker, 2025; Lin et al., 2023). This receptor-specific interaction subsequently supports the hypothesis that the compound will upregulate mitochondrial β-oxidation genes, enhance fatty acid catabolism, and lead to a clinical improvement in hepatic steatosis seen in NASH patients.

Expected Effect:
Based on its molecular mechanism, the expected pharmacodynamic effects of Resmetirom in NASH include a significant reduction in hepatic fat content as well as improvements in liver inflammation and fibrosis markers. In cellular assays and preclinical models, activation of THRβ by Resmetirom results in a dose-dependent increase in the expression of mitochondrial β-oxidation genes like CPT1A and DIO1, leading to enhanced fatty acid oxidation and a subsequent reduction in intrahepatic lipid accumulation (Sinha et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2023). In the proposed assays, human hepatocytes which naturally express high levels of THRβ should show increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption, elevated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and lower levels of intracellular triglycerides upon treatment with Resmetirom. Additionally, the upregulation of these genes has been confirmed in clinical trials where patients demonstrated marked reductions in liver fat measured by MRI-PDFF, reductions in liver transaminases (ALT and AST), and improvements in fibrosis biomarker levels (Harrison et al., 2020; Karim & Bansal, 2023). Given that NASH is characterized by not only steatosis but also progressive fibrosis and inflammation, the expected overall impact should include histological improvements—observable as decreased steatosis and improved fibrosis scores on follow-up liver biopsies—as well as enhanced mitochondrial function in hepatocytes. The anticipated results include a normalization of metabolic profiles, improved lipid parameters (reduction in LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and other atherogenic lipoproteins), and decreased serum markers of liver injury. These outcomes collectively support the therapeutic hypothesis that Resmetirom can modulate hepatocyte metabolism effectively and mitigate the progression of NASH.

Overall Evaluation:
Resmetirom presents as a highly promising candidate for the treatment of NASH based on its clear mechanistic rationale, favorable clinical trial outcomes, and well-delineated therapeutic profile. Among its strengths is the high selectivity for THRβ which confers liver specificity, thereby reducing the potential for off-target, systemic adverse effects often seen with thyroid hormone-based therapies. The compound’s ability to robustly upregulate mitochondrial β-oxidation genes such as CPT1A and DIO1 has been demonstrated in preclinical studies and is supported by clinical Phase II data that shows significant reductions in liver fat, improvements in liver enzyme profiles, and beneficial effects on biomarkers of fibrosis (Karim & Bansal, 2023; Harrison et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2022). Moreover, the extensive clinical trial program, including several pivotal trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; 2019a; 2019b; 2021), provides robust proof-of-concept data that bolster the therapeutic potential of Resmetirom in NASH management. The compound has demonstrated not only significant metabolic improvements but also a manageable safety profile with gastrointestinal side effects being the most common and generally mild (Hasan et al., 2025; Karim & Bansal, 2023).

Nonetheless, there are also some challenges and weaknesses that need attention. While early-phase trials have shown promise, long-term safety data remain limited, particularly regarding potential effects in advanced liver disease or cirrhosis. Although Resmetirom has been evaluated in patients with noncirrhotic NASH and even in well-compensated cirrhosis under controlled conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022), comprehensive long-term outcomes related to liver-related morbidity and mortality are still under investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022). Another concern is that while the upregulation of key mitochondrial genes is an integral part of its mechanism, direct gene and protein expression data from human liver biopsy specimens are limited and further mechanistic studies may be needed to fully elucidate the intracellular pathways involved (Sinha et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2022). In addition, the therapeutic effect on fibrosis appears modest and may require combination therapy approaches to achieve more robust antifibrotic outcomes. Overall, despite these caveats, Resmetirom’s strong receptor specificity, clinical efficacy in reducing hepatic steatosis, and its favorable safety profile position it as one of the most promising repurposed therapeutic candidates for NASH. Its clear mechanistic rationale—centered on the upregulation of mitochondrial β-oxidation and enhanced hepatic lipid catabolism through selective THRβ activation—matches well with the pathophysiological demands of NASH treatment, and further large-scale Phase III data are eagerly awaited to confirm its long-term benefits (Levien & Baker, 2025; Karim & Bansal, 2023).

In summary, based on the comprehensive review of available biochemical, preclinical, and clinical literature, Resmetirom has significant potential for treating NASH. Its molecular mechanism, which activates THRβ in hepatocytes and promotes mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation by upregulating genes such as CPT1A and DIO1, is both biologically plausible and supported by early clinical proof-of-concept data. The compound has already demonstrated notable reductions in hepatic fat content and improvements in liver enzymes, which are pivotal outcomes in NASH management. While long-term data and detailed molecular profiling in human liver tissue are still needed to fully ascertain its antifibrotic efficacy and long-term safety, the strengths of Resmetirom—such as its receptor specificity and favorable metabolic outcomes—make it a compelling candidate to direct further clinical development efforts. The promising early-phase clinical trial results, combined with robust mechanistic insights from preclinical studies, suggest that Resmetirom could play an important role in addressing the high unmet need for effective NASH therapies (Alkhouri, 2020; Karim & Bansal, 2023; Harrison et al., 2020).
