Overview of Therapeutic Candidate

C75 is a synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor that was originally designed to overcome the shortcomings of natural FAS inhibitors. Its development stemmed from early observations with cerulenin, a natural antibiotic isolated from the fungus Cephalosporium caerulens that was found to inhibit FAS by covalently binding to its active site, specifically targeting the β‐ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain (Alwarawrah, 2016). Cerulenin’s clinical utility was hampered by its instability, primarily due to the presence of a reactive epoxy group that led to non‐specific interactions and chemical lability. To address these issues, medicinal chemists modified the core α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone scaffold of cerulenin to yield C75, which lacks the reactive epoxide. This modification significantly improved the chemical stability and pharmacologic reproducibility of the compound while preserving its ability to inhibit FAS (Kuhajda et al., 2000).

Belonging to a class of synthetic FAS inhibitors, C75 acts predominantly by interacting with critical catalytic domains of the FAS enzyme complex. Although its primary binding is localized at the KS domain, there is evidence suggesting that other domains, such as the thioesterase (TE) domain, may also be affected in some cellular contexts (Kuhajda et al., 2000). This class of compounds has historically served as valuable research tools for dissecting the role of de novo lipogenesis in both cancer and metabolic diseases. In preclinical models, FAS inhibitors have been used extensively to demonstrate that cells with high rates of lipogenesis—such as certain cancer cell types and hepatocytes in metabolic disease—are particularly vulnerable to interference in fatty acid synthesis (Alwarawrah, 2016; Ashworth, 2017). The structural rationale that led to the synthesis of C75 exemplifies how rational drug design can transform a natural product lead into a more clinically viable molecule by eliminating reactive moieties and improving stability.

Furthermore, the chemical series to which C75 belongs has been studied across a range of biomedical applications. In cancer biology, FAS inhibitors have been used to explore the role of lipogenesis in supporting rapid cell proliferation. In metabolic studies, these inhibitors have been investigated for their potential to reduce lipogenic flux and decrease lipid accumulation in tissues such as the liver. This dual applicability underscores the broader utility of FAS inhibitors as both mechanistic probes and potential therapeutic agents (Ashworth, 2017).

────────────────────────────────────────
Therapeutic History

The therapeutic history of C75 is best understood against the backdrop of two main fields of investigation: oncology and metabolic disorders. Initially, inhibitors of FAS like cerulenin were used in cancer research due to the observation that many aggressive cancers—including breast, prostate, and ovarian tumors—overexpress FAS. In these settings, high de novo lipogenesis supports rapid membrane synthesis and energy production, making FAS an attractive target. However, the inherent instability and broad reactivity of natural inhibitors limited their use. C75 was therefore developed as a more stable, synthetic derivative to retain the beneficial inhibitory effects on FAS without the liabilities of cerulenin (Kuhajda et al., 2000; Pandey et al., 2012).

In oncology, numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated that treatment with C75 reduces fatty acid synthesis, ultimately leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells. For example, in human cancer cell line studies, C75 was shown to preferentially bind to FAS, leading to a reduction in lipid biosynthesis that is critical for tumor growth (Kuhajda et al., 2000). Xenograft models further supported these findings, with C75 administration resulting in significant tumor growth inhibition while sparing non-malignant tissues such as the bone marrow and gastrointestinal epithelium.

Beyond its use in cancer, the metabolic properties of C75 have been explored in animal models of obesity and related metabolic dysfunctions. In rodent studies, C75 administration has been observed to trigger marked weight loss, improve glycemic control, and reduce hepatic steatosis. Its effects on reducing fat mass were linked to its ability to inhibit de novo lipogenesis, which in turn modulated energy storage and altered systemic lipid metabolism (Kuhajda, 2006; Batchuluun et al., 2022). However, it is important to note that while these supportive studies in obesity and cancer provide a strong mechanistic rationale, direct evaluations of C75 for treating liver‐specific pathologies such as NASH remain limited. Most evidence for its potential in NASH has been extrapolated from its effects on lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and rodent models of hepatic steatosis (Ashworth, 2017; Batchuluun et al., 2022).

In summary, the preclinical history of C75 includes robust evidence in oncology and metabolic research that underscores its capacity to inhibit FAS and reduce lipogenesis. Despite promising data in these areas, the translation of C75 into clinical trials for metabolic liver disease—specifically, non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)—has not advanced significantly. Instead, later‐generation FAS inhibitors (e.g., TVB-2640) have moved forward into clinical studies for liver diseases, suggesting that while C75 remains a valuable proof‐of‐concept tool, its role in clinical development for NASH is more exploratory at this stage (Batchuluun et al., 2022).

────────────────────────────────────────
Mechanism of Action

At the molecular level, C75 exerts its biological effects by targeting fatty acid synthase (FAS), the enzyme responsible for the de novo synthesis of long‐chain fatty acids from acetyl‐CoA and malonyl‐CoA. FAS is a multifunctional protein complex composed of several enzymatic domains including the β‐ketoacyl synthase (KS), enoyl reductase (ER), and thioesterase (TE) domains. Biochemical studies have shown that C75 predominantly interacts with the KS domain, thereby inhibiting the condensation reaction that is vital for fatty acid chain elongation (Kuhajda et al., 2000; Wu & Zhang, 2010).

Under normal metabolic conditions, malonyl‐CoA serves a dual role in hepatocytes. On one hand, it is the critical substrate for FAS in the lipogenic pathway; on the other, it acts as a potent inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), the enzyme that regulates the transport of long‐chain fatty acyl‐CoAs into mitochondria for β‐oxidation. In a situation of high FAS activity, malonyl‐CoA is rapidly consumed, thereby relieving its inhibition on CPT1 and promoting fatty acid oxidation. Conversely, when FAS is robustly inhibited by a compound like C75, there tends to be an accumulation of malonyl‐CoA which would normally further inhibit CPT1. It is within this context that a paradox arises: despite the expectation of malonyl‐CoA accumulation, some experimental systems have reported increased fatty acid oxidation following C75 treatment, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms may be acting either to re‐balance malonyl‐CoA pools or to modulate CPT1 activity directly (Alwarawrah, 2016; Miller, 2014).

One explanation for this counterintuitive effect is that the inhibition of de novo fatty acid synthesis itself may trigger a compensatory activation of fatty acid oxidation pathways. In certain models, C75 treatment has been shown to result in enhanced CPT1 activity and increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation rates despite the potential buildup of malonyl‐CoA. This may be due to alterations in the subcellular compartmentalization of malonyl‐CoA or feedback loops that fine‐tune the activity of CPT1 in response to changing lipid fluxes (Miller, 2014; Wang et al., 2012).

In addition to its primary action at the KS domain, there is evidence that C75 might also interact with other catalytic domains of FAS, such as the TE domain. Dual targeting of multiple steps in the fatty acid synthesis pathway could amplify the inhibitory effect on lipogenesis, further reducing the cellular production of fatty acids like palmitate, which is essential for triglyceride synthesis and membrane formation (Kuhajda et al., 2000).

The interplay between FAS inhibition and CPT1 modulation is central to the therapeutic hypothesis for NASH. In NASH, hepatocytes exhibit an upregulation of FAS, which contributes to excessive accumulation of fatty acids and triglycerides. This overproduction of malonyl‐CoA not only drives steatosis but also exacerbates the inhibition of CPT1, leading to impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. By inhibiting FAS, C75 is expected to decrease the production of new fatty acids, thereby reducing the consumption of malonyl‐CoA. In an ideal scenario, such an intervention would decrease hepatic triglyceride accumulation and possibly allow for a rebalancing of malonyl‐CoA concentrations that could then relieve the inhibition on CPT1. The net effect would be an increase in mitochondrial fatty acid β‐oxidation, helping to clear accumulated lipids in the liver (Pandey et al., 2012; Wu & Zhang, 2010).

Thus, the molecular action of C75 can be summarized as follows:
 1. Direct binding to the KS domain of FAS, inhibiting the conversion of malonyl‐CoA and acetyl‐CoA into long‐chain fatty acids.
 2. Potential secondary effects on other FAS domains, such as the TE domain, which further suppress de novo lipogenesis.
 3. Modulation of intracellular malonyl‐CoA levels and, through potential feedback or compartmentalization effects, a reduction in the inhibitory tone on CPT1.
 4. An overall shift in the cellular lipid balance, from enhanced fatty acid synthesis toward increased mitochondrial β‐oxidation (Alwarawrah, 2016; Wu & Zhang, 2010).

────────────────────────────────────────
Expected Effect in a NASH Context

The central hypothesis for repurposing C75 in NASH treatment is based on the notion that inhibiting de novo lipogenesis will reduce hepatic triglyceride accumulation. In non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, excessive fatty acid synthesis is a driving factor behind steatosis, which over time leads to inflammation, fibrosis, and progressive liver injury. By specifically targeting FAS, C75 is expected to impede the conversion of acetyl‐CoA and malonyl‐CoA into palmitate and other fatty acids that form the building blocks of triglycerides. This should result in a significant drop in the substrate availability needed for triglyceride deposition in hepatocytes (Ashworth, 2017).

In hepatocyte cell systems—such as those using HepG2 cells or primary human hepatocytes—the inhibition of FAS by C75 should lead to a measurable decrease in the formation of lipid droplets. These cells normally respond to elevated de novo lipogenesis by increasing the expression of lipogenic genes such as FASN; therefore, a reduction in lipogenesis via FAS inhibition is expected to be accompanied by lower intracellular fatty acid levels (Ashworth, 2017). Biochemical assays in these systems would likely reveal decreased incorporation of radiolabeled precursors into lipids, reflecting a robust suppression of fatty acid synthesis.

An important element in the expected mechanism is the modulation of malonyl‐CoA levels. In the context of NASH, high malonyl‐CoA not only drives fatty acid synthesis but also suppresses CPT1, thereby reducing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The classical view is that inhibition of FAS should lead directly to an accumulation of malonyl‐CoA; however, several studies have indicated that C75 treatment can result in an overall metabolic shift favoring fatty acid oxidation. This could occur via two non‐mutually exclusive mechanisms. First, a decrease in fatty acid synthesis may lower the overall demand for malonyl‐CoA, thereby altering its steady‐state levels or its subcellular partitioning. Second, there may be a compensatory upregulation or activation of CPT1 in response to decreased lipogenesis, enhancing the mitochondrial uptake and oxidation of fatty acids (Wu & Zhang, 2010; Batchuluun et al., 2022).

In rodent models where hepatic steatosis is induced either by dietary manipulation or genetic modification, administration of C75 has been shown to reduce the liver’s lipid burden. The expected outcomes in these models include a decrease in liver weight, reduced deposition of lipid droplets, and lower levels of serum markers indicative of liver injury (such as ALT and AST). Additionally, improvements in systemic metabolic parameters—such as blood glucose and insulin sensitivity—have been documented, which may further contribute to the overall improvement in liver histology and function (Kuhajda, 2006; Batchuluun et al., 2022).

Given that hepatocytes express high levels of FAS in NASH, the target of C75 is directly relevant to the diseased cells. The anticipated reduction in de novo lipogenesis should, in theory, alleviate the lipotoxic stress that drives both inflammatory and fibrotic responses in the liver. In addition to decreasing triglyceride synthesis, the metabolic rebalancing toward increased β‐oxidation could lead to lower levels of toxic lipid intermediates, further mitigating cellular stress and preventing progression from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis.

It is noteworthy, however, that the interplay between malonyl‐CoA dynamics and CPT1 activity is complex. Although C75 is expected to relieve CPT1 inhibition indirectly through its effects on FAS, some experimental findings have suggested that acute administration may also lead to direct or indirect changes in CPT1 activity. The net effect would be a shift in the balance from storage (lipogenesis) to oxidation (β‐oxidation), ultimately reducing the accumulation of hepatic triglycerides (Miller, 2014; Wang et al., 2012).

Thus, in a NASH context, the expected effects of C75 include:
 • A significant reduction in the de novo synthesis of fatty acids in hepatocytes.
 • Lower intracellular levels of palmitate, resulting in decreased triglyceride synthesis.
 • A rebalancing of malonyl‐CoA dynamics that permits enhanced CPT1 activity and mitochondrial β‐oxidation.
 • Measurable improvements in liver histology, including reduced steatosis and potentially alleviated inflammation and fibrosis.
These outcomes would collectively address the core metabolic imbalance underlying NASH (Ashworth, 2017; Batchuluun et al., 2022).

────────────────────────────────────────
Overall Evaluation

In our overall evaluation of C75 as a candidate for the treatment of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis, several key points emerge regarding both its promise and its limitations.

On the positive side, the mechanistic rationale for targeting FAS in NASH is strong. C75 is a rationally designed molecule that effectively inhibits de novo lipogenesis by binding to the KS domain of FAS. This targeted action not only reduces the formation of fatty acids required for triglyceride synthesis but also has the potential to modulate the malonyl‐CoA–CPT1 axis that is deranged in NASH. Preclinical studies in cancer and metabolic disease models have demonstrated that C75 can decrease lipid synthesis, reduce hepatic steatosis, and improve systemic metabolic parameters such as blood glucose and insulin sensitivity (Kuhajda et al., 2000; Miller, 2014).

In rodent models, C75 has produced compelling evidence of reduced liver fat accumulation and improved markers of liver injury. These observations suggest that, if the drug’s dosing can be carefully managed to achieve sufficient hepatic exposure while minimizing off‐target effects, it has the potential to reverse at least some of the pathological features of NASH. In hepatocyte‐based assays, inhibition of FAS by C75 is expected to lower intracellular triglyceride levels through a dual mechanism involving both a reduction in substrate production (via decreased palmitate synthesis) and a shift toward increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (Ashworth, 2017; Pandey et al., 2012).

Notwithstanding these strengths, several significant drawbacks are evident:
 • One major concern is the systemic effect of C75 on appetite and energy balance. In multiple rodent studies, repeated administration of C75 has been linked to pronounced anorexia and weight loss. These systemic side effects are believed to arise, at least in part, from central nervous system actions where FAS inhibition alters hypothalamic signaling pathways (Miller, 2014; Wang et al., 2012). For patients with NASH—many of whom already face nutritional and metabolic challenges—such adverse effects could be detrimental.
 • Although C75 has been studied extensively in cancer and obesity models, there is a dearth of direct clinical or preclinical evidence of its efficacy in NASH. Much of the supportive data in a liver context have been extrapolated from studies in rodent models of hepatic steatosis or from in vitro assays in hepatocytes. In contrast, later‐generation compounds with enhanced selectivity and improved pharmacokinetic properties (such as TVB‐2640) have advanced further in clinical development for NASH (Batchuluun et al., 2022; Ashworth, 2017).
 • The interplay between FAS inhibition and CPT1 activation is complex and not fully understood. Some studies have suggested that while inhibition of FAS by C75 would theoretically lead to an accumulation of malonyl‐CoA and further dampen CPT1 activity, compensatory mechanisms might instead lead to an overshoot in CPT1‐mediated fatty acid oxidation. Such an imbalance could possibly induce oxidative stress and hepatocellular injury if not carefully titrated (Wu & Zhang, 2010; Wu, 2023).
 • Finally, issues related to species differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of C75 may hinder its translation from preclinical models to human therapy. Variability in the expression of FAS, differences in central regulation of appetite, and divergent metabolic responses between rodents and humans all contribute to uncertainty regarding the clinical efficacy and safety profile of C75 (Batchuluun et al., 2022; Ashworth, 2017).

Given the multifactorial nature of NASH – where steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis are intertwined – a medication that solely targets de novo lipogenesis may not be enough to fully reverse the disease process. Combination therapy or the development of next‐generation FAS inhibitors with more favorable safety profiles might be necessary for meaningful clinical benefits. Nonetheless, C75 provides an important proof‐of‐concept by clearly demonstrating that the FAS–malonyl‐CoA–CPT1 axis is a viable target for modulating hepatic lipid metabolism (Alwarawrah, 2016; Pandey et al., 2012).

────────────────────────────────────────
Final Recommendation and Future Directions

In summary, C75 offers a compelling mechanistic rationale for the treatment of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis by directly targeting fatty acid synthase and potentially restoring the balance between lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. The compound’s design as a synthetic FAS inhibitor – derived from natural product leads and optimized for stability – makes it a valuable tool for investigating the therapeutic modulation of the FAS–malonyl‐CoA–CPT1 axis (Kuhajda et al., 2000; Alwarawrah, 2016).

However, significant challenges exist. The pronounced systemic effects, particularly anorexia and weight loss observed in rodent models, may limit its utility in chronic conditions like NASH where preservation of nutritional status is critical. Moreover, the available data in liver disease models are less extensive than in oncologic or obesity settings, necessitating further rigorous preclinical evaluation focused on hepatic endpoints.

Future research strategies should consider:
 • Refining dosing regimens and exploring targeted delivery systems (for example, hepatocyte‐specific formulations) to concentrate the action of C75 within the liver while minimizing central side effects.
 • Conducting systematic dose–response studies in advanced animal models of NASH to monitor not only steatosis but also inflammation, fibrosis, and the possible development of oxidative stress due to altered CPT1 activity.
 • Investigating the detailed kinetics of malonyl‐CoA and CPT1 in hepatocytes following C75 treatment to better understand the compensatory metabolic responses and ensure that the promotion of β‐oxidation does not cause secondary injury.
 • Comparing the efficacy and safety profile of C75 with later‐generation FAS inhibitors that are currently undergoing clinical evaluation for NASH, such as TVB‐2640, to ascertain whether modifications to the chemical structure or delivery mode might yield a superior therapeutic candidate.

Overall, while C75 remains a valuable investigational tool that strongly validates the therapeutic concept of modulating de novo lipogenesis in NASH, its current safety concerns and systemic side effects present significant hurdles for clinical translation as a monotherapy. It may serve best as a lead compound for further optimization or as part of a combination strategy aimed at addressing both metabolic dysregulation and inflammatory/fibrotic pathways in the liver (Batchuluun et al., 2022; Wu, 2023).

Based on the current literature, our recommendation is that further preclinical efforts be directed toward either modifying the structure of C75 – to reduce central nervous system penetration and off‐target anorectic effects – or developing novel analogs that retain the beneficial FAS inhibitory action while exhibiting a more favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile. In parallel, robust comparative studies should be initiated to benchmark C75’s efficacy and toxicity against other emerging FAS inhibitors in advanced NASH models.

In conclusion, while C75 demonstrates a mechanistically attractive approach via inhibition of FAS and potential relief of malonyl‐CoA–mediated inhibition on CPT1, its current profile as a standalone therapeutic agent for NASH is limited by systemic adverse effects and an incomplete understanding of its metabolic impacts in human‐relevant models. Thus, C75 is best regarded at this stage as a powerful proof‐of‐concept molecule that has contributed significantly to our understanding of the FAS–malonyl‐CoA–CPT1 axis, yet will require additional refinement or combination with other therapeutic strategies for successful clinical application in NASH (Ashworth, 2017; Pandey et al., 2012).

────────────────────────────────────────
Closing Remarks

The repurposing of C75 for non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis is founded on a logically sound mechanistic approach. By targeting fatty acid synthase – an enzyme upregulated in NASH and critical for excessive lipid accumulation – C75 works to restore the balance between lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Despite its promising biochemical and preclinical profile, the transition from laboratory success to clinical efficacy is challenged by significant side effects, notably weight loss and potential exacerbation of metabolic imbalance if CPT1 activation is not properly controlled.

Moving forward, a concerted effort to optimize the delivery and chemical properties of C75, possibly through targeted drug development or formulation strategies, is required. Only with such modifications can we ensure that the benefits of modulating the FAS–malonyl‐CoA–CPT1 axis are harnessed in a safe and efficacious manner for patients suffering from NASH.

In summary, while C75 represents a compelling scientific tool and a promising starting point for therapeutic intervention in NASH, its current utilization is best limited to proof‐of‐concept studies. Future directions should prioritize structural refinement, targeted delivery, and robust, comparative preclinical evaluation to ultimately develop a viable therapeutic agent for the complex pathophysiology of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis.
