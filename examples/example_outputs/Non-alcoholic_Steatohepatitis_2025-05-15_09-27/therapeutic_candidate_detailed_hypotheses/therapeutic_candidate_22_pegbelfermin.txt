Proposal for Pegbelfermin (BMS-986036, BMS)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pegbelfermin is a PEGylated analog of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) developed by Bristol‐Myers Squibb to address metabolic dysfunctions associated with non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (Verzijl et al., 2020). It belongs to the class of endocrine regulators that mimic the natural hormone FGF21, originally discovered for its role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism (Geng et al., 2020). The PEGylation modification enhances the molecule’s stability and extends its half‐life, overcoming the limitations of native FGF21 which typically exhibits a short circulating half‐life of only a few hours (Unknown Reference). The synthesis of pegylated FGF21 involves biotechnological production in recombinant systems with the integration of a polyethylene glycol moiety that reduces proteolytic degradation and immunogenicity, thereby facilitating subcutaneous dosing regimens that improve patient compliance (Verzijl et al., 2020). As a therapeutic compound, pegylated FGF21 analogs have been widely investigated for metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity, and now their application is being repurposed toward treating NASH due to overlapping mechanisms of metabolic dysregulation (Cate, 2022). This candidate draws upon extensive prior research on FGF21 biology and has emerged as a promising molecular approach aimed at modulating the multiple metabolic and fibrotic pathways implicated in liver disease (Falamarzi et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Pegbelfermin has undergone rigorous preclinical evaluation as well as several phase 2 clinical trials in patients with NASH and related metabolic disorders, demonstrating consistent reductions in hepatic fat and favorable effects on fibrosis biomarkers (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Early clinical studies, such as the randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial designated NCT02413372, provided evidence that pegylated FGF21 therapy could significantly lower liver fat content within a 16-week treatment period (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Additional trials, including NCT03486899 and NCT03486912, have further expanded its clinical profile by investigating its effects on patients with advanced fibrosis and compensated cirrhosis, thereby validating its potential utility across different stages of NASH progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018a; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018b). The extensive therapeutic history of this compound is supported by data demonstrating improvements in key metabolic parameters including serum lipid levels, adiponectin secretion, and hepatic fat fraction as measured by MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) (Loomba et al., 2023). Preclinical rodent studies have substantiated these clinical findings by documenting an increase in mitochondrial oxygen consumption and biogenesis, further indicating pegylated FGF21’s ability to regulate energy metabolism within hepatocytes (Geng et al., 2020). Furthermore, the safety profile of Pegbelfermin has been established across multiple studies, with adverse events generally being mild and manageable, thus reinforcing its repurposing potential for NASH (Cate, 2022). Overall, the therapeutic history of pegylated FGF21 analogs positions pegelfermin as a candidate with promising early‐phase clinical outcomes that warrant further investigation in larger and prolonged trials (Noureddin et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
Pegbelfermin acts by binding to fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) in a complex with the co‐receptor β-Klotho, which is highly expressed in metabolic tissues including liver and adipose tissue (Raptis et al., 2023). Once engaged, the FGFR1/β-Klotho receptor complex activates intracellular signaling cascades that include the RAS/MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and STAT pathways, ultimately resulting in metabolic reprogramming (Cate, 2022). This receptor-mediated activation upregulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), a critical transcriptional regulator that governs genes responsible for fatty acid oxidation (Falamarzi et al., 2022). In turn, increased PPARα activity leads to enhanced expression of several key enzymes such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), which facilitate mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation respectively (Raptis et al., 2023). The upregulation of these enzymes is expected to drive the oxidation of fatty acids, thereby decreasing hepatic lipid accumulation and improving mitochondrial function in hepatocytes (Raptis et al., 2023). Additionally, this mechanism contributes indirectly to the reduction of lipotoxicity and may attenuate inflammatory and fibrotic signals, thus addressing two central pathogenic components of NASH (Generaux et al., 2022). The overall biochemical cascade engendered by pegylated FGF21 analogs thereby represents a multi‐targeted endocrine approach to correcting the metabolic dysregulation observed in NASH (Geng et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assays, pegelfermin is expected to enhance hepatic fatty acid oxidation by activating the FGFR1/β-Klotho receptor complex, which in turn upregulates PPARα expression and downstream β-oxidation enzymes such as CPT1A and ACOX1 (Raptis et al., 2023). The increased expression and activity of these enzymes will lead to an elevated rate of mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, thereby reducing the intracellular accumulation of triglycerides that contribute to steatosis (Cate, 2022). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that pegelfermin treatment is associated with increased oxygen consumption and improved mitochondrial biogenesis in hepatocytes, validating the hypothesis that enhanced metabolic function underlies the therapeutic effect (Loomba & Frias, 2023). In patients with NASH, clinical trial data have consistently shown robust reductions in hepatic fat content and improvements in fibrosis biomarkers following pegelfermin administration, which support the expected mechanistic outcomes in vivo (Loomba et al., 2023). Moreover, the expected improvement in mitochondrial function can help restore energy homeostasis within hepatocytes and reduce the lipotoxic environment that drives inflammation and fibrogenesis (Noureddin et al., 2020). It is anticipated that these beneficial changes will be reflected in both imaging assessments—such as significant improvements on MRI-PDFF—and in serum biomarkers, including reductions in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (Loomba et al., 2023). As the target protein FGFR1 is expressed in both liver and adipose tissues where β-Klotho is co-localized, the compound’s endocrine effects also contribute to systemic improvements in insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles, ultimately mitigating the progression of NASH (Raptis et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Pegbelfermin stands out as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for NASH given its robust mechanism of action and encouraging clinical data from phase 2 trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Its design as a PEGylated FGF21 analog ensures improved pharmacokinetics and dosing feasibility compared to native FGF21, which is an important advantage for chronic treatment regimens (Verzijl et al., 2020). The compound’s ability to engage the FGFR1/β-Klotho receptor complex and subsequently activate downstream pathways that enhance fatty acid oxidation is well substantiated by both preclinical and clinical studies, thereby providing a strong biochemical rationale for its use in NASH (Raptis et al., 2023). Clinically, pegelfermin has demonstrated promising efficacy by significantly reducing hepatic fat content and ameliorating fibrosis markers over a treatment period that is acceptable in the context of NASH management (Loomba et al., 2023). The observed improvements in metabolic parameters such as triglyceride levels, LDL cholesterol, and adiponectin further reinforce the potential of pegelfermin to address the systemic metabolic disturbances characteristic of NASH (Generaux et al., 2022). One notable strength of this therapeutic candidate is its multi‐targeted approach: by not only reducing hepatic steatosis but also potentially impacting inflammatory and fibrotic processes, pegelfermin may offer comprehensive benefits that extend beyond simple fat reduction (Falamarzi et al., 2022). Additionally, its favorable tolerability profile—characterized predominantly by mild gastrointestinal side effects—adds to its clinical attractiveness when compared to other emerging agents that sometimes present with more severe adverse reactions (Loomba & Frias, 2023).

However, several challenges remain that must be addressed through further clinical investigation. Although short‐term data are promising, longer‐duration studies are necessary to confirm whether pegelfermin can translate biochemical improvements into meaningful histological and clinical endpoints such as reversal of fibrosis or reduced progression to cirrhosis (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018a; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018b). Moreover, optimal dosing regimens need to be established to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing the likelihood of developing tolerance or rebound phenomena, as suggested by dose‐response analyses that hint at a ceiling‐effect beyond a particular dose level (Lu et al., 2024). The complexity of NASH as a disease entity—with contributions from genetic predisposition, metabolic syndrome, and lifestyle factors—may also necessitate combination therapies to achieve the best outcomes, and future studies should evaluate pegelfermin in such multi‐drug protocols (Cate, 2022). Additionally, while the activation of PPARα and the subsequent upregulation of key enzymes such as CPT1A and ACOX1 is mechanistically compelling, further research is needed to elucidate the long‐term impact of such metabolic shifts on overall hepatic function and systemic metabolism (Raptis et al., 2023).

In summary, pegelfermin represents a compelling therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NASH due to its well‐defined molecular mechanism involving FGFR1/β-Klotho activation, its ability to enhance fatty acid oxidation through PPARα‐mediated pathways, and its demonstrated efficacy in reducing hepatic fat and improving fibrosis biomarkers in early‐phase clinical trials (Loomba et al., 2023). Its engineered stability via PEGylation offers practical advantages for chronic therapy, and its effects on metabolic parameters extend its potential benefits to systemic improvements in insulin sensitivity and lipid homeostasis (Noureddin et al., 2020). Strengths of pegelfermin include its multifaceted mode of action, favorable safety profile, and robust preclinical and clinical data that support further development. Weaknesses include the necessity for longer‐term studies to confirm histological improvements, the need to optimize dosing strategies to avoid tolerance, and the potential requirement for combination treatments to fully address the heterogeneity of NASH pathogenesis (Loomba & Frias, 2023).

Based on the comprehensive literature review, our evaluation supports the continued development of pegelfermin as a therapeutic agent for NASH. Its mechanistic rationale—centered on the activation of the FGFR1/β-Klotho receptor complex leading to enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation—and its demonstrated efficacy in reducing liver fat and improving metabolic parameters form a strong foundation for its use in this indication (Raptis et al., 2023). Nevertheless, further phase 3 studies are warranted to assess long‐term outcomes and potential benefits on liver histology in a broader patient population, which will ultimately determine whether this candidate can be integrated into the clinical management paradigm for NASH (Loomba et al., 2023). Given the current unmet need for effective NASH therapeutics and the promising early clinical data, pegelfermin should be prioritized for further investment and development, with careful attention paid to dose optimization and combination therapy strategies that may enhance its efficacy (Cate, 2022).

In conclusion, the evidence gathered from preclinical models, early‐phase clinical trials, and mechanistic studies compellingly indicates that pegelfermin has the potential to address key pathological features of NASH by improving hepatic fatty acid oxidation, mitigating steatosis, and reducing fibrotic progression. Its favorable pharmacokinetic profile enabled by PEGylation, combined with its robust engagement of metabolic signaling pathways, positions it as a particularly innovative candidate in the burgeoning field of NASH therapeutics (Generaux et al., 2022). Moving forward, our research team should focus on designing and executing longer‐term, larger‐scale clinical trials that incorporate histological endpoints along with metabolic biomarkers, which will provide the definitive evidence needed to validate pegelfermin as a disease‐modifying therapy for NASH (Loomba et al., 2023). Such studies will not only clarify the full therapeutic potential of pegelfermin but also establish its place among other emerging agents targeting the metabolic underpinnings of NASH, thereby guiding our next steps in drug development and repurposing strategies (Noureddin et al., 2020).
