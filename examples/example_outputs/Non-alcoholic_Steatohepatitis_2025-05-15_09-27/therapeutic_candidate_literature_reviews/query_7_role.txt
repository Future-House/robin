Query: Role of key transcriptional and epigenetic regulators of hepatic β-oxidation such as PPARα, PPARδ, PGC1α, SIRT1, and AMPK in NASH development, including target validation studies assessing modulation effects on lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis in hepatocyte and rodent NASH models

PPARα is a central nuclear receptor that governs hepatic fatty acid β‐oxidation. It transcriptionally upregulates genes involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, thereby reducing lipid accumulation in hepatocytes—a protective mechanism in NASH. Notably, target validation studies in rodent models demonstrate that hepatocyte-specific deletion of PPARα leads to steatosis under fasting conditions, underscoring its pivotal role in counteracting lipid overload and inflammation (chen2018insightsintothe pages 6-8).

PPARδ, another isoform highly expressed in the liver, is implicated in regulating both anabolic and catabolic aspects of lipid metabolism. It modulates de novo lipogenesis and can influence the production of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) through the control of enzymes such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1). This activity not only protects hepatocytes against saturated fatty acid-induced lipotoxicity but also promotes an anti-inflammatory state via M2 macrophage activation. In vivo target validation using rodent studies has shown that activation of PPARδ, under appropriate conditions, supports fatty acid oxidation and attenuates inflammatory responses, although its effects on fibrosis may be context-specific (chen2018insightsintothe pages 8-10).

PGC1α, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, acts as a transcriptional coactivator that enhances the activity of PPARα, thereby amplifying β-oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis. Its role in NASH is further highlighted by studies showing that reduced PGC1α expression is associated with impaired mitochondrial function, susceptibility to oxidative stress, and exacerbated hepatic steatosis. Preclinical studies employing mouse models and hepatocyte cultures support that upregulation of PGC1α improves lipid catabolism and mitigates inflammation, thus stalling NASH progression (piccinin2019metabolicaspectsin pages 17-21).

SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, exerts significant epigenetic control over metabolic pathways by deacetylating transcription factors such as PGC1α and FOXO1. Its activation is known to enhance fatty acid oxidation and reduce lipogenesis as well as inflammatory signaling. In hepatocyte and rodent NASH models, overexpression or pharmacological activation of SIRT1—using agents like resveratrol and synthetic activators—has been shown to improve lipid profiles, diminish oxidative stress, and reduce tissue fibrosis. Conversely, SIRT1 deficiency exacerbates inflammation and steatosis, highlighting its regulatory importance (ding2017emergingrolesof pages 10-10).

AMPK, the AMP-activated protein kinase, functions as the cellular energy sensor and plays a critical role in maintaining energy homeostasis. By phosphorylating targets that promote fatty acid oxidation and inhibit lipogenesis, AMPK activation leads to improved insulin sensitivity and reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation. Rodent studies consistently demonstrate that AMPK activation—either achieved directly with specific agonists or indirectly via compounds such as metformin—not only reduces steatosis but also suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine production and fibrosis markers, thereby attenuating overall NASH pathology (gore2020investigatingfibrosisand pages 16-18).

Collectively, these transcriptional and epigenetic regulators form a tightly interwoven network that modulates hepatic β-oxidation and energy metabolism. Target validation studies—from genetic knockout experiments to pharmacological interventions in both hepatocytes and rodent models—indicate that modulating this regulatory network results in significant improvements in lipid accumulation, reductions in inflammatory gene expression, and amelioration of fibrotic progression within the liver. This body of evidence supports the therapeutic potential of targeting PPARα, PPARδ, PGC1α, SIRT1, and AMPK to strategically restore metabolic balance and counteract NASH development (chen2018insightsintothe pages 23-24, jain2018dualpparαγagonist pages 9-11, kumar2020thepparαγ pages 11-12).
