Query: Genetic, biochemical, and functional evidence implicating mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation impairment in NASH pathogenesis, with studies linking dysregulation or mutation of CPT1, ACADs, and related enzymes to disease severity and metabolic dysfunction in human liver samples and animal models

Mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation is central to hepatic energy metabolism, and its impairment has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) through genetic, biochemical, and functional evidence. Under physiological conditions, long‐chain fatty acids are imported into mitochondria via the carnitine shuttle system, wherein carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) converts fatty acyl-CoA to acyl-carnitine, facilitating mitochondrial entry and subsequent oxidation by acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) and related enzymes. Disruption of this process, either by dysregulation in gene expression or by mutation in key enzymes such as CPT1 and ACADs, impairs β-oxidation, leading to hepatic lipid accumulation, enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and eventual inflammation and fibrosis that characterize NASH (OpenTargets Search: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-CPT1,ACADs).

Biochemical studies in human liver samples and animal models have consistently shown that a reduction in CPT1 activity or its dysregulated expression is associated with progressive NASH. For instance, several studies indicate that impaired CPT1-mediated fatty acid transport results in intramitochondrial lipid accumulation and steatosis, which in turn fosters oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (baker2018mitochondrialrolein pages 4-6, perla2017theroleof pages 3-5). In experimental models such as the STAM mouse model, upregulation of the LPL/FABP4/CPT1 axis during NASH progression has been linked to metabolic reprogramming that facilitates liver carcinogenesis, thereby underscoring the functional consequences of altered CPT1 expression (OpenTargets Search: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-CPT1,ACADs).

Genetic studies further substantiate the role of mitochondrial β-oxidation impairment in NASH. Polymorphisms and mutations affecting CPT1 and acyl-CoA dehydrogenases compromise enzyme functionality, diminishing the capacity for fatty acid oxidation and leading to lipid accumulation. Genetic predisposition involving these enzymes is evidenced by altered expression levels and activity in both human patients and animal models, correlating with increased hepatic inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress (berardo2020nonalcoholicfattyliver pages 6-7, baker2018mitochondrialrolein pages 6-7). These genetic alterations disrupt normal mitochondrial metabolism and significantly contribute to the metabolic dysfunction observed in NASH.

Functional evidence from animal models supports the notion that impaired mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation is not merely a secondary consequence but a driving factor in NASH pathogenesis. For example, models with pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockdown of CPT1 exhibit a clear phenotype of reduced fatty acid oxidation, accumulation of acylcarnitines, and subsequent hepatic lipotoxicity. These metabolic derangements lead to increased ROS production and trigger downstream inflammatory cascades, which promote hepatocyte injury and fibrosis (garcia‐ruiz2018mitochondrialoxidativestress pages 6-7, maseko2024mitochondrialfunctionsin pages 35-38). Moreover, impaired activity of ACAD enzymes further compounds these effects by obstructing the progressive chain-shortening steps within the β-oxidation cycle, thereby exacerbating the biochemical milieu conducive to NASH progression (todisco2022pparalphaas pages 8-10).

The interplay between mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation impairment and key regulatory pathways has also been highlighted by studies involving peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). PPARα, a nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of fatty acid oxidation genes including CPT1 and ACADs, is downregulated in NASH, resulting in further suppression of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation capacity. This creates a vicious cycle where impaired oxidation leads to lipid buildup, which in turn reinforces PPARα downregulation and amplifies oxidative stress and inflammation (li2022mitochondriahomeostasisbiology pages 5-6, zhao2023mitochondrialdysfunctionin pages 9-11).

Despite the robust preclinical evidence linking impaired mitochondrial β-oxidation enzyme function to NASH, there remains a notable gap in clinical translation, as evidenced by the absence of clinical trials specifically targeting these mitochondrial pathways (Clinical Trials Search: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-CPT1,ACADs). Overall, the convergence of genetic, biochemical, and functional data points to dysregulation and mutation of CPT1, ACADs, and associated mitochondrial proteins as central to the metabolic dysfunction and disease severity observed in NASH, highlighting these enzymes as promising therapeutic targets for future interventions (baker2018mitochondrialrolein pages 2-3, ciaula2021mitochondriamattersystemic pages 2-4).
