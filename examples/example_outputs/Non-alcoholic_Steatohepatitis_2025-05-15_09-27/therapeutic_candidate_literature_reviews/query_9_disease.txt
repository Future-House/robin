Query: Disease models recapitulating human NASH hepatocyte lipid metabolism dysregulation: evaluation of primary human hepatocytes, iPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells, and 3D organoid/spheroid systems for assessing fatty acid oxidation deficits and screening mitochondrial β-oxidation enhancers

Primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) have long served as the benchmark for modeling human hepatocyte function since they inherently preserve essential metabolic pathways, including those controlling fatty acid oxidation, yet are hampered by donor variability, limited availability, and a restricted culture lifespan that challenges their utility for long-term studies of NASH pathology (pelecha2021cellmodelsand pages 1-2). PHHs allow direct, ex vivo assessment of lipid accumulation and mitochondrial β-oxidation deficits; however, they exhibit issues in reproducibility and in maintaining in vivo-like cellular architecture over prolonged culture periods (park2022threedimensionalorganoidsas pages 11-13).

Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) address some of these limitations by offering a renewable, genetically relevant platform that recapitulates many functional attributes of primary hepatocytes. Although these HLCs often display an immature phenotype relative to adult hepatocytes, their capacity to retain genetic background-specific features—such as the predisposition to lipid droplet accumulation observed in NASH—makes them valuable for dissecting the molecular underpinnings of fatty acid oxidation deficits (pelecha2021cellmodelsand pages 11-13). Furthermore, iPSC-derived models enable high-throughput screening for mitochondrial β-oxidation enhancers, as they can be generated in large quantities and manipulated under defined conditions (park2022threedimensionalorganoidsas pages 5-6).

Three-dimensional (3D) organoid and spheroid systems represent an advanced evolution in in vitro modeling, as they more closely mimic the in vivo liver microenvironment by enabling cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions and preserving crucial aspects of liver architecture, including bile canaliculi network formation. Such complex multicellular constructs are assembled either from primary cells or from iPSC-derived HLCs combined with non-parenchymal cell (NPC) types, such as hepatic stellate cells, cholangiocytes, and Kupffer cells. This physiological mimicry is critical for reproducing the dysregulated lipid metabolism characteristic of NASH, including steatosis, altered fatty acid oxidation, and associated inflammatory responses (morell2024novel3dapproach pages 5-8).

The 3D coculture systems have shown enhanced metabolic functionality, with improved expression of key enzymes involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation compared to 2D monocultures. When exposed to free fatty acids (FFAs), 3D organoids display dose-dependent lipid droplet accumulation, oxidative stress, and a transcriptomic profile that mirrors the metabolic dysregulation seen in NASH patients, thus validating their suitability as preclinical platforms for screening mitochondrial β-oxidation enhancers (ramli2020humanpluripotentstem pages 29-37). These models provide the structural and functional context necessary for accurately evaluating potential therapeutic agents that aim to correct fatty acid oxidation deficits, as the 3D architecture supports sustained hepatocyte function over time (park2022threedimensionalorganoidsas pages 6-8).

Moreover, the integration of omics approaches with these 3D models has enabled detailed mapping of metabolic pathways, revealing the critical role of impaired mitochondrial β-oxidation in the progression from simple steatosis to NASH. This comprehensive understanding has paved the way for targeted drug screening, wherein candidate compounds designed to enhance mitochondrial β-oxidation can be evaluated for their efficacy in reducing lipid accumulation and oxidative stress (pelecha2021cellmodelsand pages 13-14).

In conclusion, while PHHs represent the gold-standard baseline for human hepatocyte function, their limitations necessitate the use of alternative models such as iPSC-derived HLCs and 3D organoid/spheroid systems for the study of NASH. The latter models not only recapitulate the complex cell–cell interactions and hepatic architecture essential for accurate modeling of lipid metabolism dysregulation, but also provide robust platforms for assessing fatty acid oxidation deficits and screening mitochondrial β-oxidation enhancers—a critical need in the preclinical evaluation of NASH therapeutics (hassan2020liver‐on‐a‐chipmodelsof pages 1-3).
