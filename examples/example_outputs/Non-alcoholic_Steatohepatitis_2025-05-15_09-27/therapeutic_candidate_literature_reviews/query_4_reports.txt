Query: Reports of pharmacokinetic and safety assessments for novel mitochondrial β-oxidation activators in preclinical and early clinical studies for NASH or related metabolic liver diseases, emphasizing dosing regimens that achieve target engagement in liver tissue, bioavailability, half-life, and observed adverse effects

Novel mitochondrial β-oxidation activators for NASH have undergone extensive pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety evaluations in both preclinical models and early clinical trials. Collectively, these studies emphasize dosing regimens designed to ensure adequate liver tissue exposure, favorable bioavailability, extended half-life, and a manageable adverse effect profile.

Preclinical data illustrate that compounds such as pegozafermin (BIO89-100) demonstrate dose-dependent pharmacokinetic profiles when delivered subcutaneously. In the NCT04048135 study, varying doses (3–36 mg) administered weekly or biweekly over 12 weeks enabled the measurement of key parameters—maximum serum concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC), and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) up to 168 hours postdose. This design ensured that dosing regimens could be optimized to achieve sufficient exposure in liver tissue, supporting engagement of mitochondrial targets while maintaining acceptable safety (NCT04048135).

BAR502, evaluated in the Phase I study NCT06705998, provides another example. In healthy subjects, BAR502 was administered in both single and multiple ascending dose formats. Its pharmacokinetic assessments—including Cmax, Tmax, and AUC—were complemented by monitoring biomarkers such as serum bile acids and FGF19. These pharmacodynamic measurements were critical for inferring hepatic target engagement, while safety assessments (including vital signs, ECGs, and liver function tests) confirmed its tolerability over a 14-day dosing period (NCT06705998).

The direct AMPK activator PXL770, as reported by fouqueray2021pharmacodynamiceffectsof, showcases that oral dosing can achieve satisfactory plasma exposure and target engagement in liver tissue by significantly reducing hepatic de novo lipogenesis. The study, though limited in duration, found that 500 mg once-daily dosing was associated with measurable metabolic improvements and an adverse event profile comparable to placebo, underscoring the potential of such agents to modulate mitochondrial β-oxidation safely (fouqueray2021pharmacodynamiceffectsof pages 1-3).

In preclinical studies of mitochondrial uncouplers like SHS4121705, data showed robust liver localization with a calculated Cmax of approximately 81 µM and a half-life of 5.7 hours in mice. These pharmacokinetic characteristics, along with extensive tissue distribution data (e.g., highest drug levels in the liver), demonstrated that the compound attains therapeutic concentrations in hepatic tissue while avoiding the hyperthermic adverse effects seen with classical uncouplers. Later studies further refined such compounds to optimize oral bioavailability and metabolic stability, ensuring that dosing regimens lead to reliable target engagement with limited toxicity (garcia2021mitochondrialuncouplersdevelopment pages 61-66, garcia2021mitochondrialuncouplersdevelopment pages 81-86).

Additionally, clinical evaluations of agents like EDP-305 through studies such as NCT03207425 have focused on how hepatic impairment influences drug exposure. This single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver dysfunction quantified parameters including Cmax, AUC, and elimination half-life up to 216 hours postdose. Such extended sampling windows are pivotal for refining dosing recommendations in patients with compromised liver function, ensuring effective target engagement with minimized risk (NCT03207425).

Collectively, a surge of clinical trials—reflected in the broad search on mitochondrial activators in NASH—attests to the commitment to rigorously assess dosing, bioavailability, half-life, and safety. The cumulative data underline that optimal dosing regimens must balance sufficient liver exposure (to engage the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway) against the potential for adverse effects, ensuring both efficacy and safety in this challenging patient population (Clinical Trials Search: AREA[Condition]NASH OR AREA[Condition]nonalcoholic steatohepatitis AND (AREA[InterventionName]mitochondrial activator OR AREA[InterventionName]fatty acid oxidation activator OR AREA[InterventionName]β-oxidation activator) AND (pharmacokinetics OR safety OR bioavailability OR adverse OR dosing OR target engagement)).
