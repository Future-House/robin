Query: Literature on commercially available small molecules modulating key regulators of mitochondrial β-oxidation (eg, CPT1 activators, PPARα agonists, AMPK modulators) in NASH-model hepatocytes, including vendor catalog numbers, potency, selectivity, preclinical efficacy outcomes, mechanistic specificity, and preliminary safety data

The literature includes numerous studies on small molecules that modulate mitochondrial β‑oxidation in NASH‐model hepatocytes, with a particular focus on PPARα agonists and AMPK modulators. However, while several compounds are frequently mentioned, the available excerpts do not provide vendor catalog numbers, detailed potency values, or strict selectivity metrics.

PPARα agonists have received extensive attention as regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism. Classical fibrates such as bezafibrate, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, and pemaﬁbrate have been evaluated in both animal models and early clinical studies. These agents work through agonizing the PPARα receptor, leading to enhanced mitochondrial β‑oxidation, decreased hepatic steatosis, and improved lipid profiles. Preclinical studies in NASH models report that these compounds reduce inflammation and fibrosis markers while improving biochemical endpoints such as ALT, AST, and lipid parameters (xu2022targetedtherapeuticsand pages 11-12, prikhodko2022pharmacotherapyfornonalcoholic pages 9-11). In addition, multi‐PPAR agonists such as elafibranor (a dual PPARα/δ agonist), saroglitazar (PPARα/γ agonist), and lanifibranor (a pan‐PPAR agonist) have been clinically evaluated with promising reductions in steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Although their preclinical efficacy outcomes and clinical endpoints indicate a clear mechanistic specificity toward modulating mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, these sources uniformly state that detailed vendor catalog numbers, potencies, and selectivity profiles are not provided (xu2022targetedtherapeuticsand pages 6-7, prikhodko2022pharmacotherapyfornonalcoholic pages 9-11).

Regarding AMPK modulators, molecules such as nitazoxanide and PXL770 have been highlighted for their role in enhancing mitochondrial β‑oxidation via AMPK activation. Nitazoxanide, which is already FDA approved as an antiparasitic agent, has shown preclinical efficacy by reducing dyslipidemia, steatosis, fibrosis, and inflammation in NASH models. Similarly, PXL770 has demonstrated improvements in steatosis and insulin sensitivity at early clinical phases (prikhodko2022pharmacotherapyfornonalcoholic pages 21-23, xu2022targetedtherapeuticsand pages 7-8). However, as with the PPARα agonists, the reported studies do not include vendor catalog numbers, nor do they quantify potency or selectivity in a way that would facilitate direct commercial evaluation.

It is also notable that while CPT1 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1) is recognized as a key enzyme in fatty acid mitochondrial entry and subsequent β‑oxidation, the excerpts do not mention any commercially available small‐molecule CPT1 activators. Instead, the literature emphasizes compounds that indirectly modulate pathways affecting mitochondrial β‑oxidation through receptors and enzymes such as PPARα or upstream activation via AMPK (xu2022targetedtherapeuticsand pages 29-29, xu2022targetedtherapeuticsand pages 31-31).

Preclinical efficacy outcomes reported in animal models (using various diet-induced or genetic models of NASH) consistently point to reduced hepatic steatosis, diminished inflammatory markers, and attenuated fibrosis upon treatment with these agents. Despite these encouraging efficacy outcomes and mechanistic rationale, the available texts highlight a lack of granular data such as vendor-provided product identifiers, quantitative potency measurements (e.g., EC50 values), and selectivity profiles, as well as comprehensive preliminary safety data beyond general remarks, for example, noting gastrointestinal side effects or mild liver enzyme modulation with some of these agonists (prikhodko2022pharmacotherapyfornonalcoholic pages 27-28, xu2022targetedtherapeuticsand pages 10-11).

In summary, while the literature clearly supports the utility of small molecules—especially PPARα agonists and AMPK modulators—in modulating mitochondrial β‑oxidation to ameliorate NASH features in hepatocyte models, detailed commercial product specifications such as vendor catalog numbers, exact potency, and selectivity data are not provided in the current excerpts (xu2022targetedtherapeuticsand pages 11-12, prikhodko2022pharmacotherapyfornonalcoholic pages 16-18).
