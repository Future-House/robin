Query: Preclinical evaluation of candidate therapeutics targeting hepatic mitochondrial β-oxidation in NASH models, detailing efficacy and mechanism of action in rodent or patient-derived hepatocyte systems, dose–response relationships, target engagement confirmation by biochemical assays, and in vivo tolerability assessments

Candidate therapeutics targeting hepatic mitochondrial β-oxidation in NASH are undergoing a rigorous preclinical evaluation that integrates assessments of efficacy, mechanism of action, dose–response relationships, target engagement, and in vivo tolerability. In rodent models as well as patient-derived hepatocyte systems, efficacy is primarily quantified by reductions in hepatic triglyceride accumulation and overall liver fat content. For instance, a metabolic cofactor supplementation study (NCT04330326) administered a cocktail including N‑acetylcysteine, L‑carnitine tartrate, nicotinamide riboside, and serine to obese patients with NAFLD. This trial employed a two-stage dosing regimen—a half dose initially followed by a full dose—to determine the impact on liver fat as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and to monitor metabolic endpoints, thereby demonstrating an improvement in hepatic β‑oxidation that translated to decreased liver fat content (NCT04330326).

Mechanistically, many candidate therapeutics are designed to modulate nuclear receptor pathways that regulate fatty acid oxidation. Activation of receptors such as PPARα leads to the upregulation of enzymes critical for mitochondrial β‑oxidation, including components like acyl-CoA oxidase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT‑1). Preclinical data have shown that downregulation of PPARα in NASH is associated with impaired fatty acid oxidation and a consequent buildup of lipid intermediates that contribute to inflammation and fibrosis. The engagement of these nuclear receptors not only improves fatty acid oxidation but also mitigates secondary inflammatory responses, supporting a dual mechanism of action (hong2021theroleand pages 12-13, gul2023decipheringtherelational pages 32-33).

Dose–response relationships are critically evaluated by administering incremental doses in rodent models, with each dose carefully correlated to changes in biochemical biomarkers. Studies measuring hepatic malonyl-CoA levels, triglycerides, and oxidative stress markers have mapped these relationships to determine the optimal therapeutic window. For example, in some preclinical models, escalating doses of metabolic modulators have demonstrated a graded improvement in hepatic β‑oxidation, where intermediate doses maximized therapeutic efficacy while minimizing off‐target effects (berardo2020nonalcoholicfattyliver pages 6-7, santoslaso2021pathophysiologicalmechanismsin pages 14-16).

Confirmation of target engagement is achieved through a combination of biochemical assays and imaging techniques. Biochemical assays focus on quantifying the expression and activity of key enzymes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, whereas advanced imaging modalities such as MRI/MRS provide non-invasive quantification of liver fat. Additionally, stable isotope tracer methodologies, as implemented in studies assessing sulforaphane supplementation (NCT04364360), provide quantitative insight into changes in oxidative metabolism both at the whole-body and hepatic levels (hong2021theroleand pages 8-9, NCT04364360).

In vivo tolerability assessments include comprehensive monitoring of biochemical and physiological parameters. Rodent studies and early clinical trials have monitored liver function tests, kidney function, hematologic parameters, and electrocardiographic data to ensure that treatments are safe at therapeutic doses. Preclinical models, including both rodent systems and patient-derived hepatocyte cultures, have demonstrated that agents designed to enhance mitochondrial β‑oxidation generally have a favorable safety profile, showing minimal signs of hepatotoxicity or systemic oxidative stress when administered within an optimized dosing regimen (salvoza2023translationalapproachfor pages 27-30, santoslaso2021pathophysiologicalmechanismsin pages 16-17). Furthermore, advanced preclinical tools including organ-on-a-chip systems have improved the translational relevance of these findings by enabling detailed evaluations of both the efficacy and tolerability of candidate drugs under conditions that closely mimic human physiology (hong2021theroleand pages 24-25, berardo2020nonalcoholicfattyliver pages 14-15).

In summary, preclinical evaluation of candidate therapeutics targeting hepatic mitochondrial β-oxidation in NASH employs a multi-pronged approach. Efficacy is confirmed by decreases in liver fat and improvements in metabolic biomarkers, mechanisms are elucidated via nuclear receptor driven enzyme modulation, dose–response is mapped with detailed biochemical assays, target engagement is confirmed through both biochemical and imaging endpoints, and in vivo tolerability is robustly assessed through clinical chemistry and physiological monitoring. This comprehensive strategy provides a strong foundation for translating these promising therapeutic interventions into effective clinical treatments for NASH.
