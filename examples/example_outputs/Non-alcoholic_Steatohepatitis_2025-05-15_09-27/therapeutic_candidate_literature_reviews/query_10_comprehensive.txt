Query: Comprehensive review of validated readouts and biomarkers for mitochondrial β-oxidation activity and lipid accumulation in NASH research, including acyl-carnitine profiling, high-resolution respirometry, radiolabeled palmitate oxidation, lipid droplet quantification, and relevance for small-molecule screening strategies

The current literature on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) supports the use of validated biochemical, biophysical, and imaging readouts to evaluate mitochondrial β-oxidation activity and lipid accumulation. These readouts are essential for stringently characterizing mitochondrial dysfunction and for screening small molecules aimed at modulating metabolic derangements in NASH (karkucinska‐wieckowska2022mitochondriaoxidativestress pages 40-42, chang2022multidimensionalbiomarkeranalysis pages 1-2).

Acyl-carnitine profiling has emerged as a sensitive biochemical marker for mitochondrial β-oxidation dysfunction. This approach quantifies acyl-carnitine species that accumulate as a consequence of incomplete fatty acid oxidation, thereby reflecting the efficiency of mitochondrial FAO flux. Variations in acyl-carnitine profiles can serve as indicators of disrupted fatty acid transport and oxidation in NASH, making it a useful metric not only for assessing disease progression but also for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in preclinical models (karkucinska‐wieckowska2022mitochondriaoxidativestress pages 40-42, chang2022multidimensionalbiomarkeranalysis pages 1-2).

High-resolution respirometry is another critical tool that directly gauges mitochondrial respiratory capacity. By measuring oxygen consumption rates in isolated mitochondria or intact cells, this technique provides quantitative insight into oxidative phosphorylation and FAO activity. The precision of this method allows for the detection of subtle changes in mitochondrial function, which are pivotal when screening for small molecules that may restore or enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics in NASH (garcia2021mitochondrialuncouplersdevelopment pages 76-81, karkucinska‐wieckowska2022mitochondriaoxidativestress pages 37-40).

Radiolabeled palmitate oxidation assays offer a direct measure of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation flux. In these assays, incorporation and subsequent breakdown of radiolabeled palmitate yields quantitative data on the rate of β-oxidation. This method provides a dynamic functional readout that can predict metabolic improvements or deficiencies in cellular or animal models of NASH. As such, it is well-suited for small-molecule screening, since compounds that enhance radiolabeled substrate oxidation are likely to improve mitochondrial function and reduce lipotoxicity (karkucinska‐wieckowska2022mitochondriaoxidativestress pages 42-44, mccullough2018stableisotopebasedflux pages 1-3).

Lipid droplet quantification is universally used to assess intracellular lipid accumulation, a hallmark of NASH pathology. This method employs imaging techniques—often combined with specific lipid stains—to quantify both the size and number of lipid droplets within hepatocytes. Increased lipid droplet load is directly correlated with impaired mitochondrial β-oxidation and overall lipid metabolic dysregulation. By providing a visual and quantitative measure of steatosis, lipid droplet quantification is invaluable in characterizing disease severity and monitoring the therapeutic impact of small molecules that aim to reduce hepatic fat burden (chang2022multidimensionalbiomarkeranalysis pages 1-2, ciaula2021mitochondriamattersystemic pages 8-10).

Together, these validated readouts—acyl-carnitine profiling, high-resolution respirometry, radiolabeled palmitate oxidation, and lipid droplet quantification—form an integrated platform for dissecting the balance between mitochondrial β-oxidation and lipid accumulation in NASH. They are used not only to improve our mechanistic understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction but also as dynamic endpoints in small-molecule screening strategies. When a compound modulates mitochondrial respiration, increases β-oxidation, or reduces lipid accumulation, such effects can be detected using these methods, indicating its potential therapeutic utility in NASH (mccullough2018stableisotopebasedflux pages 12-14, naguib2020dietaryfattyacid pages 14-17).

This multidimensional approach, by combining metabolic flux analyses with imaging-based lipid assessments, enables researchers to correlate biochemical changes with histopathological outcomes, thereby enhancing the translational relevance of preclinical findings to human disease. As such, these biomarkers are indispensable in the current landscape of NASH research and drug discovery (ciaula2021mitochondriamattersystemic pages 10-12, ciaula2021mitochondriamattersystemic pages 32-34).
