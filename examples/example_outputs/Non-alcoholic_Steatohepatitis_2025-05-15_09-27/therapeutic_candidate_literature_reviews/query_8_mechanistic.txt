Query: Mechanistic interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, ER stress, and impaired fatty acid oxidation during NASH progression: in-depth analyses of reactive oxygen species effects on β-oxidation enzymes, stress-response signaling, and identification of potential molecular intervention points

Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and impaired fatty acid oxidation (FAO) interact in a tightly regulated, yet ultimately self‐reinforcing, network that drives the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Excess free fatty acids (FFAs) overload hepatocytes and lead to mitochondrial metabolic strain. Initially, increased FAO and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity serve compensatory roles; however, chronic lipid overload overwhelms these protective mechanisms, causing inefficient electron transport and increased electron leakage. This electron leakage elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, initiating oxidative damage to mitochondrial components and β-oxidation enzymes such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT1), long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), and very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) (amorim2022mitobulletantioxidanttargeting pages 93-97).

The resultant oxidative stress not only directly inactivates these enzymes by post-translational modifications (e.g., carbonylation or acetylation) but also destabilizes the integrity of the electron transport chain (ETC), further reducing ATP production and intensifying ROS generation. Consequently, the impairment of β-oxidation contributes to the accumulation of toxic lipid intermediates and free fatty acids, thereby exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction in a deleterious feedback loop (ciaula2021nonalcoholicfattyliver pages 1-2). Additionally, ROS-mediated damage extends to mitochondrial DNA and cardiolipin, compromising mitochondrial membrane potential and integrity (grattagliano2021protocolsformitochondria pages 212-214).

ROS also act as pivotal signaling molecules that activate various stress-response pathways. In particular, ROS trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the ER through key mediators such as PERK, IRE1, and ATF6, culminating in the induction of proapoptotic factors like CHOP and the activation of stress kinases such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). JNK signaling, in turn, propagates proinflammatory responses and further impairs FAO by interfering with the proper expression and function of mitochondrial enzymes (arroyaveospina2021roleofoxidative pages 5-6). This interplay causes a vicious cycle: malfunctioning mitochondria produce excessive ROS that induce ER stress, and persistent ER stress worsens mitochondrial dysfunction through additional ROS production and inflammatory signaling (amorim2022mitobulletantioxidanttargeting pages 86-90).

Furthermore, the stress-response signaling networks—which include Nrf2-mediated antioxidant pathways and sirtuin (SIRT1/SIRT3)-dependent metabolic regulation—are critically involved in attempting to restore cellular homeostasis. Under normal circumstances, Nrf2 activation leads to the upregulation of endogenous antioxidant enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase), but chronic oxidative stress downregulates these defenses, thereby exacerbating oxidative damage and impairing fatty acid oxidation (ma2021oxidativestressis pages 5-7). Over time, persistent stress results in defective mitophagy and the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, which amplify the ROS burden, compromise ATP production, and ultimately trigger inflammatory cascades that promote the transition from simple steatosis to overt NASH (mooli2022oxidativestressand pages 13-15).

Based on these mechanistic insights, several potential molecular intervention points have been identified. First, direct reduction of mitochondrial ROS can be achieved with targeted antioxidants or by modulating endogenous antioxidant defenses via Nrf2 activation (masarone2018roleofoxidative pages 1-2). Second, restoration of efficient FAO through pharmacological activation of key enzymes (e.g., CPT1) or by enhancing sirtuin activity may alleviate lipid accumulation and improve mitochondrial bioenergetics (amorim2022mitobulletantioxidanttargeting pages 35-41). Third, modulation of ER stress–mediated UPR signaling—by inhibiting PERK, IRE1, or CHOP—can mitigate inflammation and cell death associated with prolonged ER dysfunction (ciaula2021nonalcoholicfattyliver pages 12-13). Finally, enhancing mitophagy through pathways such as PINK1/Parkin provides an avenue to clear dysfunctional mitochondria, thereby breaking the cycle of ROS-induced damage (grattagliano2021protocolsformitochondria pages 214-216).

Collectively, targeting these interdependent pathways may interrupt the feed-forward cycles of oxidative damage, metabolic dysregulation, and inflammatory signaling that underlie NASH progression, offering promising strategies for therapeutic intervention.
