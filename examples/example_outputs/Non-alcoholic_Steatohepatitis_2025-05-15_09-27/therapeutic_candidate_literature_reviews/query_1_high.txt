Query: High-throughput small-molecule library screening studies aiming to enhance mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation in NASH-model hepatocytes, focusing on hit identification statistics, structural diversity metrics, target validation assays, efficacy in patient-derived cells, and pharmacokinetics, safety, and ADME profiles

High-throughput small‐molecule library screening studies aimed at enhancing mitochondrial fatty acid β‐oxidation in NASH-model hepatocytes utilize a multi‐endpoint approach that integrates diverse assay modalities with computational modeling. Overall, these studies report hit identification statistics, characterize chemical structural diversity, and deploy target validation assays with variable emphasis on efficacy in patient‐derived cells and detailed pharmacokinetic as well as safety and ADME profiling.

For hit identification statistics, one study using a cell painting assay in PH5CH8 hepatocytes screened over 5,300 compounds at 2 μM concentration. The primary hit picking was based on a random forest machine learning model that quantified more than 500 features per cell. Using a 3-sigma cutoff in phenotypic scoring, 113 compounds were initially selected as putative hits, with dose–response follow-up ultimately confirming 15 compounds exhibiting significant anti-steatosis activity (e.g., α-terthienyl, among others) (wotring2023rapidlytranslationaldrug pages 59-63, wotring2023rapidlytranslationaldrug pages 79-84).

Regarding structural diversity metrics, although a breadth of chemical scaffolds was observed among hits—including natural products, cardiac glycosides, and inhibitors of signal transduction pathways—the available excerpts provide only qualitative descriptions rather than quantitative metrics. Several studies note broad structural diversity and novelty among the identified compounds (e.g., α-terthienyl with three consecutive thiophene rings) without reporting explicit diversity indices or clustering analyses (wotring2023rapidlytranslationaldrug pages 63-67, wotring2023rapidlytranslationaldrug pages 67-73).

Target validation assays are a core component of the screening workflow. These include high-content imaging coupled with machine learning to capture morphological changes in steatotic hepatocytes, as well as biochemical and receptor-binding assays. For instance, assays such as TR-FRET for coactivator recruitment and cell-based luciferase reporter assays in HEK293T cells have been employed to confirm engagement of targets like thyroid hormone receptor β (THRβ) and other relevant nuclear receptors. Additionally, gene expression analysis via RT-qPCR in hepatocyte-derived cell lines (e.g., Huh-7) and primary human hepatocytes (PHH) has been used to validate dose-dependent transcriptional changes in THR target genes (e.g., CPT1A, DIO1), confirming that compound activity translates into modulation of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathways (luong2020regulationofgene pages 7-8, luong2020regulationofgene pages 4-5).

Efficacy in patient-derived cells is less consistently reported across studies. While certain evaluations of THRβ agonists in primary human hepatocytes clearly demonstrate target gene modulation, high-content imaging screens that primarily employ immortalized liver cell lines (e.g., PH5CH8 or HepaRG cells) lack direct comparisons with patient-derived hepatocytes. Thus, although the mechanistic validation steps in these studies are robust, the direct evidence of efficacy in patient-derived cells remains limited in the context excerpts provided (luong2020regulationofgene pages 2-4, luong2020regulationofgene pages 5-7).

Pharmacokinetics, safety, and ADME profiles were integrated into the workflow in some studies through the application of IVIVE models and in vivo validation. For example, one study linked in vitro cellular concentrations with in vivo exposures using toxicokinetic modeling to derive oral equivalent doses, thereby contextualizing in vitro efficacy with clinical plasma C_max values. Additionally, hit compounds like α-terthienyl were further evaluated in mouse models, establishing effective in vivo doses (as low as 1 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection) and beginning to characterize their safety profiles. However, detailed pharmacokinetic parameters, comprehensive ADME studies, and in-depth safety assessments remain less thoroughly described, highlighting an area for further investigation (muller2022chemicalscreeningof pages 36-39, wotring2023rapidlytranslationaldrug pages 59-63, wotring2023rapidlytranslationaldrug pages 67-73).

In summary, current high-throughput screening studies in NASH-model hepatocytes present robust hit identification and target validation methodologies that integrate high-content imaging and machine learning with biochemical and transcriptional assays. While qualitative assessments of structural diversity and early pharmacokinetic and safety data are provided, further work is necessary to comprehensively profile efficacy in patient-derived cells and fully characterize ADME properties.
