Query: Identify studies exploring dysregulated iron metabolism, mitochondrial iron overload, and associated oxidative stress pathways in Friedreich’s ataxia models, with emphasis on validated molecular targets for therapeutic intervention to restore bioenergetics

Studies in Friedreich’s ataxia (FA) have converged on the pathological interplay between dysregulated iron metabolism, mitochondrial iron overload, and ensuing oxidative stress, with multiple models validating molecular targets for therapeutic intervention aimed at restoring mitochondrial bioenergetics.

Frataxin deficiency underlies the core pathology in FA and leads to impaired iron–sulfur (Fe-S) cluster and heme biosynthesis. The resulting deficiency disrupts the normal iron utilization in mitochondria, causing nonprotein‐bound iron to accumulate within the mitochondrial matrix—a phenomenon directly linked to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress (chiang2016frataxinandthe pages 1-2, chiang2016frataxinandthe pages 8-10). In particular, studies using both yeast and mouse models have demonstrated that the reduction in frataxin levels adversely impacts the Fe-S cluster assembly machinery, where key components such as NFS1, ISCU, and associated chaperones like Isu are compromised. This impairment not only disrupts the electron transport chain but also renders the mitochondrial environment more susceptible to oxidative damage (chiang2016frataxinandthe pages 16-17, monfort2022recentadvancesin pages 1-2).

The dysregulation of iron metabolism is further compounded by altered expression of iron handling proteins. Upregulation of iron importers, for example, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and mitochondrial iron transporter MFRN2, occurs in FA models, while iron efflux proteins such as ferroportin (FPN1) and key intracellular iron storage proteins like ferritin and mitochondrial ferritin (FTMT) are downregulated. These alterations intensify mitochondrial iron loading and increase the labile iron pool, subsequently enhancing redox cycling through Fenton chemistry, which further escalates ROS accumulation (chiang2016frataxinandthe pages 10-11, chiang2016frataxinandthe pages 11-12).

Notably, the oxidative stress arising from iron overload leads to compromised antioxidant defenses. This is highlighted by the suppressed activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor essential for upregulating antioxidant response element (ARE) genes. The diminished Nrf2 response in frataxin-deficient models exacerbates the oxidative milieu, thereby creating a vicious cycle of mitochondrial dysfunction and ongoing cell damage (huang2019theroleof pages 12-14, rosa2020thenrf2signaling pages 8-10). In support of this, additional evidence indicates that interventions which enhance Nrf2 signaling can restore complex I activity, improve the mitochondrial membrane potential, and protect against ROS-induced damage, suggesting that the Nrf2 pathway is a validated molecular target in FA (huang2019theroleof pages 11-12).

Therapeutic studies underscore the potential of targeting both iron dysregulation and oxidative stress simultaneously. For instance, iron chelators, such as deferiprone, have shown some efficacy by targeting mitochondrial iron deposits and reducing the severity of cardiac hypertrophy, although chelation alone does not fully restore mitochondrial function (rodriguez2020antioxidanttherapiesand pages 15-17). In parallel, combining iron chelation with antioxidants like idebenone or compounds that activate Nrf2 (e.g., omaveloxolone) has demonstrated improved outcomes in terms of restoring mitochondrial bioenergetics, reducing ROS levels, and stabilizing neuromuscular function in FA models (chiang2016frataxinandthe pages 11-12, huang2019theroleof pages 12-14).

Furthermore, research has advanced our understanding of additional molecular targets involved in combating oxidative damage. The thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems, which regulate cellular redox states, have been investigated as potential intervention points to mitigate excess oxidative stress and thereby preserve mitochondrial function in frataxin-deficient cells (secocervera2020thioredoxinandglutaredoxin pages 18-20). This approach represents a strategy where correcting the balance between oxidative damage and antioxidant protection may improve cellular energy metabolism and ultimately ameliorate neurodegeneration in FA (rodriguez2020antioxidanttherapiesand pages 25-27, rodriguez2020antioxidanttherapiesand pages 27-28).

Overall, the cumulative evidence from FA models underscores that the restoration of iron homeostasis through modulation of iron import/export proteins, enhancement of Fe-S cluster and heme biosynthesis, activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response, and targeting of redox systems such as thioredoxin and glutaredoxin represent promising molecular interventions aimed at rescuing mitochondrial bioenergetics and mitigating disease progression in Friedreich’s ataxia (chiang2016frataxinandthe pages 1-2, edzeamey2024emergingantioxidanttherapies pages 2-3).
