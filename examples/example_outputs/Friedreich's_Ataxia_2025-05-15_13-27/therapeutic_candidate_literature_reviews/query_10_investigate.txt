Query: Investigate epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of the FXN gene and mitochondrial biogenesis pathways in Friedreich’s ataxia, including histone deacetylase inhibitors or demethylating agents that upregulate frataxin expression and rescue bioenergetic deficits

Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is primarily characterized by the epigenetic silencing of the FXN gene caused by a large GAA repeat expansion in intron 1. This expansion initiates heterochromatin formation through altered histone modifications—specifically, decreased histone acetylation and increased repressive methylation (e.g., H3K9me2/3 and H4K20me2/3)—thereby limiting transcriptional elongation and reducing frataxin protein levels (nageshwaran2017epigenetictranscriptionalregulation pages 15-18).

One promising approach to reverse FXN silencing involves histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. HDAC inhibitors function by increasing histone acetylation, which promotes an open chromatin state and facilitates transcription. Several studies have demonstrated that selective inhibition of class I HDACs—including HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3—is crucial for reactivating FXN transcription. In experiments using pimelic diphenylamide derivatives, treatment led to robust, dose-dependent increases in both FXN mRNA and frataxin protein levels in patient-derived cells and animal models, thereby normalizing FXN expression to levels observed in asymptomatic heterozygous carriers (mercanti2018epigenetictherapyfor pages 45-50, mercanti2018epigenetictherapyfor pages 72-76). Additionally, HDAC inhibitors have been shown to restore the acetylation of critical lysine residues on histone H3 (e.g., H3K9ac), which is essential for transcriptional activation and may contribute to the rescue of bioenergetic deficits by enhancing mitochondrial enzyme activities (lew2022discoveryoftherapeutics pages 13-15).

Beyond HDAC inhibition, targeting histone methylation has emerged as an alternative strategy. Research has identified the histone methyltransferase SUV4-20 H1 as a key contributor to the propagation of repressive H4K20 methylation marks at the FXN locus. Chemical inhibition of SUV4-20 H1 using the selective inhibitor A-196 results in a reduction of H4K20 di- and trimethylation, while simultaneously increasing the monomethylated H4K20 mark. This epigenetic shift is associated with a significant, albeit modest, upregulation of FXN expression in FRDA patient-derived cells (vilemaenriquez2020inhibitionofthe pages 3-5, vilemaenriquez2020inhibitionofthe pages 5-7). Enhanced analogues, such as compound A3, have improved potency, reinforcing the potential of histone methyltransferase inhibitors as an alternative or complementary therapeutic strategy to HDAC inhibitors.

Restoring frataxin levels is of critical importance because frataxin plays a central role in mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster assembly and overall mitochondrial function. The bioenergetic deficits observed in FRDA—including impaired electron transport chain activity and increased oxidative stress—are secondary to frataxin deficiency. By employing either HDAC inhibitors or SUV4-20 inhibitors to upregulate FXN expression, not only is the transcriptional repression reversed, but mitochondrial biogenesis and functionality are also improved. This dual action addresses both the underlying genetic epigenetic defect and its consequential mitochondrial dysfunction, offering a comprehensive therapeutic effect (lew2022discoveryoftherapeutics pages 13-15).

While initial interest included the use of demethylating agents, evidence suggests that DNA methylation changes in the FXN locus are less critical than histone modifications in dictating FXN silencing. Thus, targeting histone acetylation and methylation appears to be a more viable approach for reactivating the FXN gene (rodden2022dnamethylationin pages 12-13).

Despite the robust preclinical data supporting the therapeutic potential of epigenetic modulation in FRDA, no clinical trials targeting these epigenetic interventions (i.e., HDAC inhibitors, demethylating agents, or frataxin-targeting epigenetic therapies) are currently registered, highlighting a significant translational hurdle that remains to be overcome (Clinical Trials Search: Friedreich’s ataxia AND (AREA[InterventionName]deacetylase OR AREA[InterventionName]demethylating OR AREA[InterventionName]epigenetic OR AREA[InterventionName]frataxin)).

Overall, both the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors and the selective inhibition of repressive histone methyltransferases show great promise for reversing FXN gene silencing and restoring mitochondrial bioenergetic homeostasis in Friedreich’s ataxia (enriquez2018epigeneticmodificationof pages 188-192, sherzai2020hmtaseinhibitorsas pages 1-2).
