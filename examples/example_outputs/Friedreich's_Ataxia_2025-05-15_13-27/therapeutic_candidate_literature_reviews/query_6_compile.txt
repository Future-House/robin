Query: Compile genetic and functional studies demonstrating frataxin deficiency’s causative role in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis disruption, mitochondrial respiratory complex assembly, and oxidative phosphorylation failure in Friedreich’s ataxia patient-derived cells

Frataxin deficiency in Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is established as the primary genetic driver for disrupted iron–sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis, leading to defective assembly of mitochondrial respiratory complexes and consequent failure of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). FRDA is caused predominantly by a homozygous GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of the FXN gene, which triggers epigenetic silencing that reduces frataxin transcription and protein levels to between 5% and 30% of normal, thereby establishing a direct genetic basis for the disease (chiabrando2020hereditaryataxiaa pages 6-8).

Frataxin, a mitochondrial protein, is integral for the assembly of Fe-S clusters by interacting with core biosynthetic components such as NFS1, ISCU, and ISD11. It functions as an iron chaperone by donating iron necessary for the formation of these clusters, and its deficiency results in diminished availability of Fe-S clusters for assembly into key mitochondrial enzymes (anguloUnknownyearneuralandcardiac pages 11-15). Without functional Fe-S clusters, enzymes like aconitase and subunits of respiratory complexes I, II, and III fail to incorporate these essential cofactors, leading to a cascade of bioenergetic deficits.

Multiple genetic studies performed using patient-derived cells, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), lymphoblastoid cell lines, and fibroblasts, have provided robust evidence that frataxin deficiency causes a marked reduction in the efficiency of Fe-S cluster assembly. These studies demonstrate that reduced frataxin levels directly correlate with diminished activity of Fe-S enzyme systems, ultimately impairing the assembly and stability of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (chiang2016frataxinandthe pages 10-11). Furthermore, patient-specific cellular models have reinforced that supplementation with frataxin can restore the activity of these pathways, highlighting its causative role in the pathogenesis of FRDA (anguloUnknownyearneuralandcardiac pages 11-15).

Functional analyses using oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy have further confirmed that frataxin deficiency leads to compromised bioenergetic function. Specifically, studies have identified deficits in basal, ATP-linked, and maximal respiration in frataxin-deficient cells, thereby directly implicating frataxin loss in the impairment of OXPHOS (davide2023humanfrataxinthe pages 3-6). In addition, targeted rescue experiments that reintroduce frataxin or frataxin-like proteins in these cells have partially restored mitochondrial oxygen consumption and the assembly of respiratory complexes, confirming that the defective bioenergetics are secondary to the primary defect in Fe-S cluster biogenesis (davide2023humanfrataxinthe pages 6-6).

At the molecular level, frataxin deficiency is also associated with an imbalance in mitochondrial iron metabolism. The defective utilization of iron for Fe-S cluster synthesis leads to a paradoxical mitochondrial iron overload, which further fuels the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This oxidative stress exacerbates defects in respiratory complex assembly and accelerates cellular damage, thereby contributing to the progressive loss of mitochondrial function observed in affected tissues such as neurons and cardiomyocytes (gonzalez‐cabo2013mitochondrialpathophysiologyin pages 1-2).

Comprehensive studies have linked these biochemical and genetic abnormalities to the clinical manifestations of FRDA, wherein impaired Fe-S cluster biogenesis disrupts the integrity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, diminishes ATP production, and induces oxidative stress that collectively underlie the neurodegenerative and cardiomyopathic aspects of the disease (martelli2014dysregulationofcellular pages 1-2, martelli2014dysregulationofcellular pages 2-3). Supporting these findings, additional analyses have demonstrated similar disruptions in mitochondrial function through the use of epigenetic therapeutic approaches aimed at reversing transcriptional silencing, thereby reinforcing the centrality of frataxin’s role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity (mercanti2018epigenetictherapyfor pages 17-22, kosman2023…actinand pages 22-25).

In sum, genetic studies and functional assays in patient-derived cells consistently demonstrate that frataxin deficiency is directly responsible for the disruption of Fe-S cluster biogenesis. This disruption impairs the proper assembly of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, leading to a failure in oxidative phosphorylation and a resultant cascade of bioenergetic insufficiency and oxidative damage that underlie the pathophysiology of Friedreich’s ataxia.
