Query: Survey existing clinical or pilot studies of repurposed metabolic modulators (e.g., NAD+ precursors, dichloroacetate, elamipretide) in Friedreich’s ataxia or related mitochondrial dysfunction disorders, focusing on bioenergetic flux outcomes, safety, and translational potential

Several clinical and pilot studies have evaluated repurposed metabolic modulators—primarily NAD+ precursors and mitochondrial‐targeted peptides such as elamipretide—in patients with Friedreich’s ataxia or related mitochondrial dysfunction disorders. For example, a Phase 2a trial (NCT04817111) of the NAD+ precursor MIB‑626 in Friedreich’s ataxia patients demonstrated that short‐term supplementation was safe and well tolerated, with only non‐serious adverse events reported. Although bioenergetic endpoints such as the cardiac phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio and grip strength did not reach statistically significant changes, a significant increase in whole blood NAD+ levels was observed, confirming biological target engagement. These initial findings support the concept that NAD+ boosting may translate into improved cellular bioenergetics if explored in larger or longer studies (NCT04817111, poltronieri2021nadprecursorsmitochondria pages 8-9).

Studies in broader mitochondrial dysfunction contexts provide converging evidence. In a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind trial (NCT02245620), elamipretide was administered to elderly subjects with mitochondrial dysfunction. The trial reported modest improvements in maximal ATP synthetic rate (ATPmax) as measured by skeletal muscle fatigue testing and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, along with slight improvements in muscle force-time integral. Importantly, the safety profile of elamipretide was favorable, as only a few non-serious adverse events were reported. Although this study was conducted in an elderly population, its bioenergetic flux endpoints (such as ATP production and mitochondrial coupling efficiency) offer valuable insights into how mitochondrial-targeted approaches may be beneficial in disorders with similar pathological features, such as Friedreich’s ataxia (NCT02245620).

Studies on nicotinamide riboside (NR) further highlight the translational potential of NAD+ precursor strategies. In one trial (NCT03432871), NR was evaluated for its capacity to promote mitochondrial biogenesis in patients with mitochondrial diseases. The study’s design, with acute pharmacokinetic monitoring and a subsequent 4-week intervention, focused on outcomes including phosphocreatine replenishment (via 31P-MRS) and mitochondrial DNA copy number as indices for improved oxidative phosphorylation. Although direct effects on Friedreich’s ataxia were not assessed in this trial, the observed enhancements in mitochondrial function and safety profile underscore the broader applicability of NAD+ precursors in mitochondrial dysfunction disorders (NCT03432871).

Additional studies employing niacin and NR in mitochondrial myopathy—a condition that shares several bioenergetic deficits with Friedreich’s ataxia—support these conclusions. Trials such as NCT03973203 and NCT05590468 are exploring dose-escalation regimens and long-term NR supplementation to assess functional outcomes like the 6-minute walk test, muscle strength, and maximal oxygen uptake. These studies also monitor detailed biochemical parameters, including circulating NAD+ and its metabolites. Their methodologies, incorporating both mechanistic endpoints (e.g., changes in mitochondrial biomarkers) and clinical functional tests, provide a framework for future investigations in Friedreich’s ataxia and similar disorders (NCT03973203, NCT05590468).

Preclinical and clinical reviews further elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings and translational challenges of using metabolic modulators. For instance, recent reviews have detailed how NAD+ precursors enhance SIRT1 activation and mitochondrial biogenesis, while elamipretide’s binding to cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial membrane improves electron transport chain integrity. Although some trials have reported only modest effects on bioenergetic flux, the overall safety profiles and mechanistic evidence support continued research into optimizing dosing strategies and extending treatment durations for significant therapeutic impact (bottani2020therapeuticapproachesto pages 22-24, bottani2020therapeuticapproachesto pages 9-11, konarikova2020currentprogressin pages 6-8).

In summary, the existing clinical and pilot studies indicate that repurposed metabolic modulators have acceptable safety profiles and can engage their intended biological targets, as shown by increased NAD+ levels and modest improvements in ATP synthesis. While further studies are needed to confirm significant bioenergetic and clinical improvements, these early-phase trials provide strong translational potential for addressing mitochondrial dysfunction in Friedreich’s ataxia and related disorders (NCT04817111, NCT02245620, NCT03432871, NCT03973203, NCT05590468, bottani2020therapeuticapproachesto pages 22-24).
