Query: Search for preclinical studies evaluating efficacy of candidate small molecules or repurposed drugs on mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates, coupling efficiency, and ATP production in Friedreich’s ataxia animal models or patient-derived neurons, with detailed target mechanism confirmation

Preclinical studies have been conducted using both animal models and patient‐derived cellular systems to evaluate the efficacy of candidate small molecules and repurposed drugs on key mitochondrial bioenergetic parameters such as oxygen consumption rate (OCR), coupling efficiency, and ATP production in Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA). Several publications have described efforts to simulate FRDA’s mitochondrial dysfunction in models that include patient‐derived fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–derived neurons and cardiomyocytes, and even rodent and invertebrate models, with assessments focusing on improved mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis.

For example, one group reported that using FRDA patient‐derived fibroblasts and iPSCs, candidate compounds like idebenone and its derivatives were evaluated for their impact on mitochondrial respiration parameters. These studies assessed parameters such as mitochondrial oxygen consumption, coupling efficiency, and ATP production, thus providing preliminary target mechanism confirmation; however, while improvements in these parameters were noted, the detailed mechanistic confirmation was often only partially addressed (clay2019newdevelopmentsin pages 3-4). Additional preclinical evaluations employing patient‐derived iPSC models have incorporated electrophysiological, molecular, and metabolic assays to assess mitochondrial function. These approaches have confirmed, at least indirectly, that treatment with selected compounds leads to improvements in ATP-dependent respiration and coupling efficiency, in part by partial restoration of frataxin levels and normalization of Fe-S cluster-containing enzyme activities (maheshwari2023patientderivedipscmodels pages 12-12).

More in-depth mechanistic confirmation comes from investigations using modified idebenone conjugates. In one study, researchers designed mitochondria-targeted compounds (MTC-A and MTC-B) to enhance lipophilicity and mitochondrial delivery. By employing advanced respirometry techniques such as the Seahorse XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer and high-resolution Oxygraph-2k measurements, these studies directly quantified mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates and ATP-dependent respiration in FRDA patient-derived fibroblasts and differentiated muscle cell models. The data showed that low nanomolar concentrations of these compounds could restore maximal respiration and ATP production to levels comparable or even superior to traditional idebenone treatments, confirming their mechanistic action by bypassing complex I deficiencies and improving coupling efficiency (thomson2023noveldiagnosticapproaches pages 49-54).

Further, additional results from related studies using similar techniques provided evidence that upon treatment with these molecules, there was an upregulation of biogenesis markers such as PGC-1α, and enhanced transcription of endogenous antioxidative regulators like NRF2. In differentiated C2C12 myoblasts challenged with oxidative stress, these mitochondria-targeted compounds not only improved oxygen consumption but also conferred protection against mitochondrial dysfunction. Such studies underscore the importance of detailed mechanistic evaluations, as they combine molecular markers (e.g., increased frataxin protein levels) with functional mitochondrial parameters (OCR, coupling efficiency, and ATP production) to validate the therapeutic potential of these compounds (thomson2023noveldiagnosticapproaches pages 45-49).

Other investigations, notably those involving small molecules like idebenone, coenzyme Q10 analogues, and Nrf2 activators (e.g., RTA408/omaveloxolone), have also focused on mitochondrial respiration measures in both animal and cell-based models. These studies, while largely preclinical, have demonstrated improvements in mitochondrial parameters. However, many of these reports note that although there is biochemical evidence for mitochondrial improvement, direct confirmation of target mechanisms via detailed quantitative assessments of OCR, coupling efficiency, and ATP production across a broad spectrum of FRDA models remains an ongoing challenge (strawser2017pharmacologicaltherapeuticsin pages 13-17).

In summary, while several preclinical studies have evaluated the efficacy of candidate small molecules—using patient-derived systems and animal models—to improve mitochondrial respiration, coupling efficiency, and ATP production, detailed mechanistic confirmation often remains incomplete. The most detailed mechanistic insights are provided by studies employing advanced bioenergetic assays that directly quantify OCR and ATP synthesis following treatment with novel, mitochondria-targeted idebenone derivatives (thomson2023noveldiagnosticapproaches pages 54-59).
