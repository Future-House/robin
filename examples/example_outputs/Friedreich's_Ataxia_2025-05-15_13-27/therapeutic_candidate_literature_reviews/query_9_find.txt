Query: Find research on mitochondrial dynamics, including fission/fusion imbalance, mitophagy impairment, and mitochondrial membrane potential loss in Friedreich’s ataxia cellular models, highlighting mechanistic insights and potential small molecule modulators of these processes

Research in Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) cellular models has revealed a complex interplay between mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitophagy, and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), offering mechanistic insights and pointing to potential therapeutic targets via small molecule modulators. At the core of these studies is a notable imbalance between mitochondrial fission and fusion processes. Under normal circumstances, fission and fusion are tightly regulated by proteins such as DRP1 (dynamin‐related protein 1) for fission and MFN1/2 and OPA1 for fusion. However, in FRDA, frataxin deficiency disrupts this balance through several mechanisms. For example, in some cellular models, oxidative stress and iron dysregulation trigger aberrant DRP1 activation via dephosphorylation and S‐nitrosylation, leading to increased mitochondrial fragmentation and loss of MMP (agarwal2025exploringmitochondrialdynamics pages 6-8, agro2020effectofmitochondrial pages 21-22). Conversely, research in cardiomyocytes derived from FRDA patients reported decreased DRP1 levels, presumably due to post‐translational regulation and decreased protein half‐life, resulting in impaired fission and excessive mitochondrial fusion, ultimately causing enlarged and dysfunctional mitochondrial networks (chidipi2022thedynaminrelatedprotein pages 12-14, chidipi2022thedynaminrelatedprotein pages 16-18).

The impaired fission process is intrinsically linked to defective mitophagy. Mitophagy, primarily mediated by the PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway, is essential for the clearance of damaged mitochondria. In FRDA, the combination of excessive oxidative stress and an imbalance favoring mitochondrial fusion hampers the effective segregation and removal of damaged organelles, leading to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria (agro2020effectofmitochondrial pages 15-17, dorn2015mitochondrialdynamismand pages 3-5). Furthermore, reduced or aberrant DRP1 function also impairs Parkin-independent mitophagy, highlighting that proper mitochondrial fission is a prerequisite for the initiation of efficient mitophagy processes (chidipi2022thedynaminrelatedprotein pages 15-16).

Mitochondrial membrane potential loss is a recurring hallmark of FRDA pathology. Multiple studies report that disruption in mitochondrial dynamics coupled with oxidative damage leads to the dissipation of the MMP, a critical factor for ATP production and overall cellular health. The loss of MMP further exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction by triggering apoptotic pathways and limiting the organelle’s capacity to maintain efficient metabolic processes (agro2020effectofmitochondrial pages 17-19, chen2023mitochondrialdynamicsin pages 4-5). This impaired bioenergetic state not only predisposes the cells to energy crises but also contributes to a self-amplifying cycle of oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage.

Therapeutically, several small molecule modulators have been proposed to counteract these defects in FRDA cellular models. Iron chelators, such as deferoxamine, have been shown to mitigate iron-induced activation of DRP1, thereby reducing excessive mitochondrial fission and preserving mitochondrial integrity (agarwal2025exploringmitochondrialdynamics pages 6-8). Additionally, mTORC1 inhibitors like rapamycin and Torin1 have emerged as potential modulators; these molecules are capable of rebalancing mitochondrial bioenergetics by reducing mitochondrial respiration, increasing membrane polarization, and alleviating stress-induced mitophagy impairment (lehmer2024investigatingthemechanistic pages 24-29, lehmer2024investigatingthemechanistic pages 39-40). Moreover, small molecule NRF2 activators, as identified by the OpenTargets Platform, are promising candidates because activating NRF2 not only boosts frataxin expression but also enables an enhanced antioxidant response, thereby reducing ROS production and stabilizing mitochondrial dynamics (OpenTargets Search: Friedreich's ataxia).

In summary, the mechanistic framework in FRDA involves a disruption of the delicate fission/fusion balance, impaired mitophagy due to compromised PINK1/Parkin and DRP1 pathways, and consequential loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Studies support the use of small molecule modulators—such as iron chelators, mTORC1 inhibitors, and NRF2 activators—to restore mitochondrial quality control and bioenergetic function, thus offering promising avenues to mitigate mitochondrial defects in FRDA cellular models (agarwal2025exploringmitochondrialdynamics pages 6-8, agro2020effectofmitochondrial pages 19-21, chidipi2022thedynaminrelatedprotein pages 16-18, lehmer2024investigatingthemechanistic pages 24-29).
