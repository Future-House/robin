Query: Identify studies reporting high-throughput or targeted screening of novel small molecules in Friedreich’s ataxia patient-derived cellular models using bioenergetic flux analysis (eg. Seahorse XF) to enhance mitochondrial respiratory capacity with target validation data

Based on the provided context, no study explicitly reports a high‐throughput or targeted screening campaign of novel small molecules in Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) patient-derived cellular models using bioenergetic flux analysis (for example, with the Seahorse XF analyzer) to enhance mitochondrial respiratory capacity with accompanying target validation data.

Several excerpts describe investigations in FRDA models that evaluate mitochondrial respiration and overall bioenergetic health using the Seahorse platform. For example, Fil et al. (fil2020mitochondrialdamageand pages 13-15, 25-28) report oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurements and mitochondrial stress tests in mutant cells, and Sacca et al. (sacca2020theupperlimb pages 51-54, 92-94) demonstrate that overexpression of frataxin isoforms or genetic rescue in patient-derived cellular models can improve mitochondrial respiration based on Seahorse data. However, despite using these bioenergetic flux analysis tools, none of these studies describe a screening strategy aimed at identifying novel small molecules.

Similarly, other sections clarify that although several studies interrogate mitochondrial dysfunction and test candidate therapeutic agents (such as NRF2 activators or epigenetic modulators) in FRDA models, the focus remains on targeted investigations or phenotypic characterization rather than on large-scale or specifically targeted chemical screening. For instance, the study highlighted by Sacca et al. (sacca2020theupperlimb pages 21-24, 94-97) and the corresponding work on FXN reporter assays do involve screening approaches; yet, they rely on transcriptional reporter readouts rather than bioenergetic flux parameters measured by Seahorse XF, and they do not provide data linking compound activity to enhanced mitochondrial respiratory capacity with validated molecular targets.

Furthermore, references such as Lorenz (lorenz2022modelingmitochondrialdisorders pages 37-40) and additional Sacca et al. excerpts (sacca2020theupperlimb pages 59-64) specifically note that while iPSC-based models and advanced image-based or high-content screening platforms have been developed to identify compounds that modulate disease-relevant phenotypes, none of these examples explicitly document the use of a Seahorse XF-based high-throughput or targeted screening approach for mitochondrial respiratory enhancement coupled with target validation data.

In summary, while several studies employ bioenergetic flux analysis to characterize mitochondrial function and assess the effects of candidate molecules in FRDA models, the provided context does not include any study that combines high-throughput or targeted small molecule screening with Seahorse XF analysis (or an equivalent method) to specifically identify and validate novel compounds that enhance mitochondrial respiratory capacity in patient-derived models of Friedreich’s ataxia (fil2020mitochondrialdamageand pages 15-17, sacca2020theupperlimb pages 21-24, sacca2020theupperlimb pages 51-54, lorenz2022modelingmitochondrialdisorders pages 37-40).
