Query: Retrieve pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, including ADME, tissue distribution, and human phase I/II trial data, for compounds shown to increase mitochondrial respiratory capacity in neurodegenerative or mitochondrial disease contexts relevant to Friedreich’s ataxia

Below is a summary of the available pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles—including aspects of ADME and tissue distribution—from early-phase clinical and in vitro studies of compounds designed to boost mitochondrial respiratory capacity in settings such as Friedreich’s ataxia and related neurodegenerative or mitochondrial diseases.

EPI-743 (vatiquinone) is under active investigation in several phase II studies for conditions including Leigh syndrome, LHON, and Pearson syndrome. Its mechanism as an NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1 cofactor enhances glutathione biosynthesis, thereby protecting against oxidative stress. In terms of safety, multiple open-label trials have reported promising tolerability, although it is notable that a phase 2 trial in MELAS was terminated because of peripheral nerve toxicity. Although the excerpts do not provide detailed ADME parameters or tissue distribution profiles, its mechanism implies effective cellular and mitochondrial uptake (koopman2016mitochondrialdisordersin pages 10-12, quinlan2021strategiesforincreasing pages 65-70).

Idebenone, a short-chain benzoquinone and CoQ10 analog, has been evaluated in phase II and III trials for LHON and Friedreich’s ataxia. In the context of Friedreich’s ataxia, despite a phase III trial showing no significant change in neurological function over six months, idebenone was well tolerated. Its PK profile suggests rapid metabolism with a reasonable tissue distribution to neural tissues, although the details on absorption, metabolism, and excretion remain limited in the provided data (koopman2016mitochondrialdisordersin pages 9-10, feng2020comparativeinvitro pages 17-19).

MTP-131 (also called Bendavia or Szeto-Schiller peptide SS-31) targets the mitochondrial inner membrane by binding to cardiolipin, thereby improving oxidative phosphorylation. It has reached phase I/II clinical evaluation in mitochondrial myopathies and LHON. While no specific quantitative ADME data or tissue distribution profiles are provided in the excerpts, its mechanism of action suggests effective delivery to and accumulation in mitochondria, with early trial indications pointing toward a favorable safety profile (koopman2016mitochondrialdisordersin pages 10-12).

KH176 has also been evaluated in phase I trials; it has shown a promising pharmacokinetic profile and good tolerability in healthy volunteers. Although the precise ADME details and tissue distribution data are not fully elaborated, the available early-phase clinical results support its potential in treating mitochondrial dysfunction (koopman2016mitochondrialdisordersin pages 10-12).

In a related preclinical study, compound 76—designed to increase frataxin expression and thereby enhance mitochondrial respiratory capacity—demonstrated improved metabolic stability relative to its predecessor. In a mouse model with subcutaneous dosing at 1 mg/kg, compound 76 exhibited a plasma half-life of approximately 1.9 hours with peak concentrations at 30 minutes; however, plasma levels dropped below quantifiable limits by 8 hours. This compound has a favorable CNS multiparameter optimization (MPO) score, suggesting the likelihood of blood-brain barrier penetration, although further ADME details (such as plasma protein binding) and dose optimization remain necessary. Its in vivo safety profile was acceptable at the tested dose with no adverse effects (quinlan2021strategiesforincreasing pages 139-144).

Finally, a broader search on ClinicalTrials.gov indicates that over 11,000 trials have been registered that involve evaluations of compounds impacting mitochondrial respiratory capacity and that assess pharmacokinetic parameters as well as ADME, tissue distribution, and early-phase safety in conditions including Friedreich’s ataxia (Clinical Trials Search: Friedreich’s ataxia OR neurodegenerative disease OR mitochondrial disease AND (mitochondria OR respiratory capacity) AND (pharmacokinetics OR ADME OR tissue distribution OR phase I OR phase II)).

In summary, while several compounds—such as EPI-743, idebenone, MTP-131, KH176, and emerging agents like compound 76—have been shown to have promising early safety and PK profiles, detailed ADME and tissue distribution data are often limited or remain to be fully characterized. Further comprehensive studies and clinical trial reports are needed to establish their complete pharmacokinetic profiles and confirm their efficacy in enhancing mitochondrial respiratory capacity in neurodegenerative and mitochondrial disease contexts relevant to Friedreich’s ataxia (koopman2016mitochondrialdisordersin pages 10-12, feng2020comparativeinvitro pages 17-19, quinlan2021strategiesforincreasing pages 139-144).
