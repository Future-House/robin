Query: Mechanisms of epigenetic silencing and transcriptional regulation of the FXN gene in Friedreich’s ataxia, including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and involvement of non-coding RNAs, and potential reporter-based screening assay development

The pathogenic mechanism underpinning Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) involves a multitiered epigenetic silencing of the FXN gene that is initiated by an expansion of GAA repeats in intron 1, which triggers a cascade of chromatin and transcriptional alterations (dong2024theregulationof pages 3-5). These expanded repeats adopt non-B DNA conformations such as triplex structures and RNA–DNA hybrids (R-loops), which physically obstruct the progression of RNA Polymerase II during transcription elongation (dong2024theregulationof pages 3-5, nageshwaran2017epigenetictranscriptionalregulation pages 11-15). The formation of these unconventional structures not only impedes polymerase activity but also appears to trigger downstream epigenetic modifications that consolidate the transcriptional repression of FXN (fernandezfrias2020analysisofputative pages 3-4).

A key epigenetic mechanism is the alteration of histone modifications at and around the expanded GAA tract. The heterochromatin environment is characterized by an enrichment of repressive histone marks such as trimethylation at histone H3 lysines 9 and 27 (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) and a reduction of activating marks, notably the decreased acetylation of H3 and H4 (dong2024theregulationof pages 3-5, giunti2017friedreichsataxiaclinical pages 3-4). In FRDA patient cells, a reduction in active histone modifications is evident at key regulatory sites, including the 5′UTR and promoter regions of FXN, which is compounded by a subsequent decline in RNA Polymerase II phosphorylation that is required for efficient transcription elongation (mikaeili2017investigatingtherole pages 36-40).

In addition to these histone changes, DNA methylation plays an integral role in maintaining the repressive chromatin state at the FXN locus. Dense hypermethylation of CpG sites immediately upstream and downstream of the GAA repeats has been observed, with a differential methylation pattern that correlates with reduced FXN mRNA levels and a more severe clinical phenotype (rodden2020methylatedandunmethylated pages 1-2, nageshwaran2017epigenetictranscriptionalregulation pages 15-18). This aberrant DNA methylation further contributes to the heterochromatinization of the region, thereby ensuring a durable silencing of the FXN gene.

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) also play a substantial role in the epigenetic regulation of FXN. Antisense transcripts, particularly FAST-1, have been documented to be upregulated in FRDA and are implicated in the reinforcement of silencing mechanisms (mikaeili2017investigatingtherole pages 102-110, mikaeili2018fast1antisenserna pages 3-6). FAST-1 exerts its regulatory influence by promoting repressive histone modifications (e.g., increased H3K9me3 and decreased H3K9ac) and altering local CTCF binding—a key chromatin insulator whose displacement further facilitates the spread of heterochromatin over the FXN locus (mikaeili2017investigatingtherole pages 141-145, mikaeili2018fast1antisenserna pages 6-7). The resultant disruption of chromatin architecture undermines not only the recruitment of the transcriptional machinery but also the formation of necessary promoter-enhancer loops, thereby cementing the gene’s transcriptional inactivity.

To better study the dynamics and regulation of FXN expression under these complex conditions, reporter-based screening assays are under development. The integration of reporter genes, either RNA-based such as MS2-binding loops or protein-based reporters like GFP fused in-frame with FXN, aims to enable real-time monitoring of transcriptional activity directly at the endogenous FXN locus (nageshwaran2017epigenetictranscriptionalregulation pages 64-67). This approach is crucial for dissecting the combinatorial contributions of histone modifications, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNA interactions in the silencing process. Furthermore, such assays have the potential to facilitate high-throughput screens employing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated epigenome editing that target specific chromatin regulators, setting the stage for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reactivating frataxin expression (dong2024theregulationof pages 5-7).

In summary, the epigenetic repression of the FXN gene in Friedreich’s ataxia is a multifaceted process involving obstructive DNA secondary structures, loss of activating histone marks, gain of repressive histone modifications, DNA hypermethylation, and the action of repressive non-coding RNAs, which together block effective transcriptional elongation and initiation while reporter-based screening assays continue to evolve as key tools for both mechanistic studies and therapeutic development (dong2024theregulationof pages 3-5, nageshwaran2017epigenetictranscriptionalregulation pages 11-15, rodden2020methylatedandunmethylated pages 1-2).
