Query: Strategies for quantifying mitochondrial function in Friedreich’s ataxia cell culture systems, focusing on high-throughput assays for oxygen consumption rate, membrane potential, ATP production, and iron-mediated oxidative damage as pharmacodynamic readouts

A robust evaluation of mitochondrial function in Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) cell culture systems relies on integrating multiple high-throughput readouts that individually and collectively inform on cellular bioenergetics and iron‐mediated oxidative stress. The primary pharmacodynamic endpoints include oxygen consumption rate (OCR), mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP production, and iron‐mediated oxidative damage.

For OCR, high‐throughput respirometry using extracellular flux analyzers constitutes the standard approach. Instruments such as the Seahorse XF Analyzer enable real‐time measurement of mitochondrial respiration in multiwell formats, allowing the quantification of basal and stressed OCR to provide insights into electron transport chain efficiency. These measurements are critical in FRDA models where frataxin deficiency leads to respiratory chain impairments. The literature underscores the suitability of OCR assessments in drug screening and mechanistic studies in FRDA cell models (mercanti2018…pharmacokinetics pages 41-45, mercanti2018…pharmacokinetics pages 45-50).

Mitochondrial membrane potential is a sensitive indicator of mitochondrial health and is typically measured using potentiometric fluorescent dyes. Dyes such as JC-1, TMRM (tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester), or Rhodamine 123 accumulate in mitochondria in a potential-dependent manner. High-throughput fluorescence plate readers or flow cytometry platforms can be employed to assess membrane potential quantitatively. Changes in membrane potential directly reflect alterations in ATP synthesis and electron transport, and thus serve as a vital pharmacodynamic readout in response to therapeutics targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in FRDA (mercanti2018…pharmacokinetics pages 45-50, mercanti2018…pharmacokinetics pages 17-22).

ATP production assays are used to gauge overall cellular energy status and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Luminescence-based assays, typically using luciferase-catalyzed reactions such as the CellTiter-Glo® assay, provide a high-throughput readout of ATP levels that correlate with mitochondrial performance in live cells. Since FRDA results in impaired ATP synthesis due to compromised mitochondrial function, quantifying cellular ATP levels is an essential surrogate marker for therapeutic efficacy in restoring mitochondrial activity. Such ATP assays are adaptable to both 2D and 3D cell culture systems, ensuring that metabolic changes can be monitored effectively in disease-relevant models (alzufairi2024enhancementofbreast pages 69-73, mercanti2018…pharmacokinetics pages 14-17).

Iron-mediated oxidative damage is another central aspect of FRDA pathology due to mitochondrial iron overload. This damage can be assessed using a multiparametric approach. Fluorescent probes such as DCFDA are employed to measure general reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, while mitochondrial-specific ROS probes like MitoSOX add specificity. Simultaneously, the assessment of lipid peroxidation markers – for instance through assays quantifying malondialdehyde (MDA) levels or using flow cytometry-based lipid peroxidation readouts – can provide complementary data regarding cellular oxidative damage. Moreover, recent applications of mitochondrial iron-specific probes like Mito-FerroGreen enable direct detection of labile Fe²⁺ within mitochondria. Such measurements directly assess the effect of iron chelation agents and support pharmacodynamic profiling in high-throughput formats, as highlighted in breast cancer models that share methodological parallels with FRDA systems (alzufairi2024enhancementofbreast pages 238-241, alzufairi2024enhancementofbreast pages 217-230).

Overall, the integration of these high-throughput assays in FRDA cell culture systems offers a comprehensive pharmacodynamic framework to evaluate mitochondrial function. By employing extracellular flux analysis to measure OCR, fluorescent probes to assess membrane potential, luciferase-based luminescence for ATP quantification, and specialized assays for detecting ROS and iron-related oxidative damage, researchers can obtain a multiparametric readout that is essential for both mechanistic studies and therapeutic screening in FRDA (mercanti2018…pharmacokinetics pages 87-90, mercanti2018…pharmacokinetics pages 95-98).

Each of these strategies not only provides individual insights into distinct aspects of mitochondrial function but also can be combined to yield an integrated profile of mitochondrial health in FRDA models. This comprehensive approach is instrumental for capturing the multifaceted mitochondrial defects induced by frataxin deficiency and for assessing the pharmacodynamic impact of potential therapeutics aimed at restoring mitochondrial function in FRDA (mercanti2018…pharmacokinetics pages 76-81).
