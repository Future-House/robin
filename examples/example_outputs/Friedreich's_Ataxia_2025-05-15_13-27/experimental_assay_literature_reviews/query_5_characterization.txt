Query: Characterization of cellular models for Friedreich’s ataxia including patient fibroblasts, iPSC-derived cell types, shRNA/CRISPR-mediated FXN knockdown lines, and identification of robust phenotypic biomarkers suitable for medium-to-high throughput drug screening, and reproducibility assessments

Cellular models for Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) have been characterized using several complementary approaches that collectively recapitulate critical disease phenotypes and provide robust, reproducible platforms for medium-to-high throughput drug screening. Patient-derived fibroblasts represent one of the earliest models generated from FRDA individuals carrying GAA repeat expansions that cause a reduction in frataxin (FXN) expression. Although fibroblasts do not always exhibit the full spectrum of biochemical and clinical manifestations seen in FRDA, they serve as an accessible starting material for reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), thereby retaining the genetic hallmarks of the disease (anguloUnknownyearneuralandcardiac pages 15-19, maheshwari2023patientderivedipscmodels pages 1-3).

iPSC-derived models have significantly advanced our ability to dissect both neural and cardiac components of FRDA pathology. Reprogramming patient fibroblasts into iPSCs, followed by differentiation into specific cell types such as neurons, cardiomyocytes, and sensory neurons, has been shown to maintain the GAA repeat expansions while dramatically reducing FXN expression, thereby recapitulating the primary pathogenic defect (maheshwari2023patientderivedipscmodels pages 1-3, schreiber2019progressinunderstanding pages 4-6). Differentiated neuronal cells consistently exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and progressive cell degeneration, in addition to aberrant oxidative stress markers that reflect the cellular consequences of FXN deficiency (schreiber2019progressinunderstanding pages 6-7, sacca2020theupperlimb pages 116-120). Similarly, iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes display functional impairments such as disorganized mitochondrial networks, reduced FXN levels, and altered electrophysiological properties, which are key readouts for assessing contractility and other relevant cardiac dysfunctions (wong2019correlationbetweenfrataxin pages 7-10, sacca2020theupperlimb pages 100-104).

In addition to using patient-derived cells, models generated by targeted gene knockdown or editing have been instrumental in elucidating the mechanisms underlying frataxin deficiency. Techniques employing shRNA and CRISPR have been applied to establish FXN knockdown lines that mimic the frataxin deficiency observed in patient cells. These genetically engineered cell lines recapitulate key aspects of FRDA pathology, including mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired iron-sulfur cluster synthesis, and increased oxidative stress (schreiber2019progressinunderstanding pages 1-3, sacca2020theupperlimb pages 92-94). Importantly, the use of gene editing tools such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and CRISPR not only allows for the creation of loss-of-function models but also enables allele-specific modifications that can reverse the pathogenic state; for example, excision of the expanded GAA repeats results in partial restoration of FXN levels and amelioration of downstream phenotypes (maheshwari2023patientderivedipscmodels pages 13-13, schreiber2019progressinunderstanding pages 4-6).

Robust phenotypic biomarkers have been identified across these models and include parameters such as FXN mRNA and protein levels, mitochondrial performance indices (e.g., mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption rates, and calcium transient amplitudes), and indicators of oxidative stress (e.g., reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation). Additionally, in cardiomyocyte models, contractility parameters and electrophysiological readouts provide direct functional measurements that are both quantitative and reproducible, making them suitable for medium-to-high throughput screening platforms (wong2019correlationbetweenfrataxin pages 7-10, sacca2020theupperlimb pages 21-24). The consistency of these phenotypic markers has been confirmed across multiple patient-derived lines and engineered genetic models, ensuring reproducibility that is critical for reliable drug screening (schreiber2019progressinunderstanding pages 6-7, anguloUnknownyearneuralandcardiac pages 40-44).

In summary, the integrated use of patient fibroblasts, iPSC-derived neural and cardiac cells, and engineered FXN knockdown lines via shRNA/CRISPR provides a comprehensive and robust cellular platform for understanding FRDA mechanisms. Critical phenotypic biomarkers—ranging from mitochondrial dysfunction to altered contractile properties—are reproducible across these models, establishing them as ideal platforms for medium-to-high throughput drug screening and therapeutic development (sacca2020theupperlimb pages 116-120, schreiber2019progressinunderstanding pages 3-4).
