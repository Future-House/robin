Query: Comprehensive review of frataxin’s role in mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster assembly, regulation of iron homeostasis and reactive oxygen species production including downstream signaling cascades and cell viability metrics in fibroblasts and neuronal cell models for assay design

Frataxin is a central mitochondrial protein with multiple roles that converge on the iron–sulfur (Fe–S) cluster biosynthetic pathway, iron homeostasis, and redox regulation, making it a prime target for assay development in fibroblast and neuronal cell models. Frataxin interacts directly with the scaffold protein ISCU and the cysteine desulfurase complex (NFS1/ISD11), facilitating the delivery of sulfur and iron necessary for de novo Fe–S cluster assembly, which is critical for the activity of many mitochondrial enzymes such as aconitase and components of the respiratory chain (campbell2021moleculardetailsof pages 21-22, campbell2021moleculardetailsof pages 4-6).

In this regulatory capacity, frataxin functions both as an iron chaperone and as an allosteric activator that modulates the kinetics of sulfur transfer reactions. Although early models proposed a primary role as an iron donor, current evidence points to a nuanced scenario where frataxin regulates the iron-loading of the ISCU scaffold and controls the flux of sulfur species through the ISC complex (campbell2021moleculardetailsof pages 21-22, chiang2016frataxinandthe pages 8-10). This fine-tuning is crucial for protecting nascent Fe–S clusters from oxidative damage, as these clusters are inherently sensitive to redox fluctuations, thereby linking frataxin to mitochondrial iron regulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) management (campbell2021moleculardetailsof pages 4-6, han2017mechanismsofiron pages 1-2).

Loss or mutation of frataxin, as exemplified by models of Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA), disrupts this balance. Deficient frataxin expression leads to impaired Fe–S cluster formation, mitochondrial iron overload, and the inappropriate accumulation of labile iron that catalyzes ROS generation. This oxidative stress is further compounded by the downregulation of key antioxidant defenses, including enzymes like mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, and the dysregulation of redox-sensitive transcription factors such as Nrf2 (chiang2016frataxinandthe pages 10-11, chiang2016frataxinandthe pages 11-12). The subsequent increase in oxidative markers and the disruption of iron regulatory networks, including altered expression of iron transporters (e.g., TfR1) and storage proteins, can drive apoptotic or ferroptotic cell death pathways, ultimately reducing cell viability (chiang2016frataxinandthe pages 7-8, doni2021acombinedspectroscopic pages 14-15).

Downstream signaling cascades triggered by frataxin deficiency involve both direct and indirect mechanisms. Mitochondrial dysfunction, coupled with ROS-mediated oxidative damage, affects multiple signaling pathways. For instance, decreased activity of Fe–S-dependent enzymes impairs ATP production and destabilizes the electron transport chain, thereby generating additional ROS that can further inhibit vital cell survival pathways (chiang2016frataxinandthe pages 8-10, perfitt2022mitochondrialdenovo pages 15-17). Furthermore, frataxin loss has been linked to alterations in redox regulatory systems, including the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems, which modulate the reversible glutathionylation of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin, thereby affecting cellular integrity and viability (secocervera2020thioredoxinandglutaredoxin pages 3-5, kosman2023decreasedfilamentousactin pages 22-25).

For the design of assays in fibroblast and neuronal cell models, it is therefore essential to incorporate endpoints that reflect these multifaceted roles. Assays should quantitatively measure Fe–S cluster assembly efficiency through activities of enzymes like aconitase, record mitochondrial iron accumulation via specific staining or biochemical quantification, and assess ROS levels using fluorescent probes. Additionally, monitoring downstream signaling cascades—such as the activation state of antioxidant transcription factors (e.g., Nrf2), changes in expression of iron regulatory proteins, and indicators of apoptosis or ferroptosis—will provide comprehensive insights into cellular health and viability in the context of frataxin deficiency (sanchez2016characterizationoffrataxin pages 7-11, OpenTargets Search: -frataxin, campbell2021moleculardetailsof pages 1-2, chiang2016frataxinandthe pages 1-2).

Collectively, these integrated readouts not only elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying frataxin’s functions in mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster assembly and iron homeostasis, but they also offer robust platforms for screening therapeutic interventions aimed at mitigating the oxidative and metabolic stresses characteristic of disorders such as Friedreich’s ataxia.
