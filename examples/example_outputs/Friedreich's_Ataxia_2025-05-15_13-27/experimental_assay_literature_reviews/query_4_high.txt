Query: High-content imaging assays to monitor mitochondrial morphology changes, iron accumulation (ferritin and labile iron pool), lipid peroxidation, and calcium homeostasis in iPSC-derived neurons and cardiomyocytes modeling Friedreich’s ataxia, including quantification methodologies and throughput considerations for assay scalability

High-content imaging assays for Friedreich’s ataxia models integrate multiplexed fluorescent staining, automated image acquisition, and sophisticated computational analysis to simultaneously monitor mitochondrial morphology, iron accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and calcium homeostasis in iPSC‐derived neurons and cardiomyocytes.

For mitochondrial morphology, these assays typically employ potentiometric dyes such as tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) and mitochondrial network markers like MitoTracker. High-resolution automated imaging systems capture individual cell data, allowing for segmentation of mitochondrial objects and quantification of parameters such as total mitochondrial area, length, aspect ratio, and connectivity. Advanced image processing routines—including white top-hat filtering, segmentation algorithms, and morphological binning—are applied to classify mitochondria into distinct phenotypic categories (e.g., puncta, rods, networks, and swollen forms). Machine learning approaches further refine subtype classification and improve sensitivity in detecting subtle changes induced by disease or pharmacological treatments. Throughput is enhanced by utilizing high-content platforms in multi-well (often 384-well) formats, combined with automated liquid handling and robust image analysis pipelines, facilitating statistically robust, single-cell quantification across large datasets (little2018asinglecell pages 11-12, leonard2015quantitativeanalysisof pages 10-11, bosch2019automatedquantitativeanalysis pages 16-17).

Monitoring iron accumulation involves detecting both ferritin levels and labile iron pools. Although not always detailed explicitly, assays are adapted by incorporating fluorescence-based probes or antibodies that recognize ferritin or bind labile iron. Immunocytochemistry and fluorescent chemical probes can be optimized to quantify iron localization and levels in live or fixed cells. These measurements can then be integrated into the high-content imaging workflow and synchronized with other cellular markers to correlate iron dysregulation with mitochondrial dysfunction and overall cell health. Rigorous image segmentation and intensity measurement algorithms ensure that changes in iron levels are quantified reproducibly. Such methodologies require validation of probe specificity and extensive calibration to account for potential fluorescence overlap with other markers (enriquez2018epigeneticmodificationof pages 80-84).

Lipid peroxidation is typically inferred from oxidative stress assays utilizing sensitive fluorescent reporters that specifically respond to peroxidized lipids. By employing dyes responsive to lipid peroxidation, these assays can provide spatial and intensity-based readouts of lipid damage. High-content screening allows for the concurrent measurement of cell viability and other oxidative parameters, ensuring that lipid peroxidation signals are not confounded by cell loss or non-specific staining. Automated image analysis across thousands of cells permits rigorous quantification of peroxidation events and comparison across treatment groups, thereby establishing robust disease-relevant endpoints.

Calcium homeostasis is assessed using calcium-sensitive dyes such as Fura-2 or other ratiometric indicators. These assays are designed to capture dynamic changes in intracellular calcium fluxes upon stimulation or pharmacological modulation. High-content platforms equipped with real-time fluorescence detection (such as FLIPR systems) collect temporal and spatial data on calcium signals. Quantification strategies thus include time-lapse imaging and kinetic analyses that measure calcium flux amplitudes, frequencies, and recovery times, ensuring both sensitive detection and high-throughput screening compatibility (grimm2015highcontentassaymultiplexing pages 4-5, enriquez2018epigeneticmodificationof pages 80-84).

Overall, the quantification methodologies across all these parameters rely on automated image acquisition, robust segmentation algorithms, intensity-based measurements, and statistical methods (such as the calculation of Z’-factors and coefficients of variation) to ensure assay quality and reproducibility. Scaling these assays to high-throughput formats is achieved by miniaturizing protocols in multi-well plate configurations, incorporating automated liquid handling systems, and using software pipelines capable of processing large datasets with minimal human intervention. This comprehensive, multiplexed approach allows for simultaneous assessment of multiple cellular parameters that are critical for modeling Friedreich’s ataxia and screening potential therapeutics (little2018asinglecell pages 2-3, sieprath2016integratedhighcontentquantification pages 14-17, grimm2015highcontentassaymultiplexing pages 7-9).
