Proposal for Leriglitazone

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Leriglitazone is a fully synthetic small‐molecule drug originally developed as a derivative within the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class, a family of compounds historically used as insulin sensitizers for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its specific design involves modifications of the parent compound pioglitazone, and it represents the active metabolite M4 in its hydrochloride form. This molecule was optimized to overcome limitations inherent to older glitazones, particularly their suboptimal brain penetration. Leriglitazone’s enhanced blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability sets it apart from conventional PPARγ agonists and renders it suitable for indications with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Belonging to the class of synthetic PPARγ agonists, it modulates transcriptional programs by binding the nuclear receptor PPARγ. This receptor is known to control gene expression programs involved in lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, inflammation, and, critically, mitochondrial biogenesis via activation of downstream coactivators like PGC-1α. In summary, leriglitazone is a rationally designed synthetic agent engineered to achieve high CNS bioavailability while harnessing the known therapeutic properties of TZDs, making it a promising candidate for repurposing in neurodegenerative disorders such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (Edzeamey et al., 2024; Pizcueta et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Thiazolidinediones historically have been used for metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes due to their insulin-sensitizing properties; however, conventional agents such as pioglitazone have also been studied for off-label neuroprotective effects because of their ability to modulate mitochondrial function and anti-inflammatory pathways. Leriglitazone, as a next‐generation PPARγ agonist, has demonstrated promising preclinical and early clinical evidence in several neurodegenerative disorders. Its clinical development has notably included studies in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), where its effectiveness was linked to its ability to attain therapeutic CNS concentrations while maintaining a favorable safety profile. In the context of FRDA—a disorder characterized by a deficiency of the mitochondrial protein frataxin that leads to impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics, iron dysregulation, and oxidative stress—early in vitro studies using FRDA fibroblasts have observed increases in frataxin protein upon treatment with leriglitazone. Moreover, clinical trial evidence in FRDA (e.g., study NCT03917225; Minoryx Therapeutics, S.L., 2019) has focused on imaging and biomarker endpoints, showing that the drug is capable of modifying disease-relevant parameters such as spinal cord morphology and markers of neuronal integrity, even though definitive efficacy outcomes are still emerging. While leriglitazone itself has not yet been approved for FRDA, the prior therapeutic history of its drug class and the encouraging biochemical and bioenergetic signals documented in FRDA models underscore its potential repurposing for this neurodegenerative condition (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Edzeamey et al., 2024; Pandolfo et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
Leriglitazone’s mechanism centers on its high-affinity binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that modulates gene transcription upon activation. Binding of leriglitazone to PPARγ results in a conformational change that facilitates dissociation of corepressors and recruitment of coactivators, notably including PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha). PGC-1α plays a pivotal role as the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation by coactivating a host of transcription factors that upregulate genes required for the synthesis and maintenance of mitochondrial proteins and respiratory chain complexes. In the context of FRDA, increased PGC-1α activity is expected to drive the formation of new mitochondria and enhance the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, thereby counteracting the bioenergetic deficits that arise from frataxin deficiency. Furthermore, evidence suggests that leriglitazone can indirectly stabilize frataxin protein levels. Although the precise molecular interactions that lead to frataxin stabilization remain to be entirely delineated, activation of the PPARγ-PGC-1α axis is proposed to upregulate mitochondrial chaperones such as GRP75 (glucose-regulated protein 75). GRP75 is essential for mitochondrial protein import and quality control, and its increased expression may help maintain proper frataxin folding and stability. By enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and reducing oxidative stress, leriglitazone also contributes to restoring mitochondrial membrane potential and normalizing intracellular calcium homeostasis, processes that are typically disrupted in FRDA models. The combined effect of these mechanisms—selective PPARγ activation, PGC-1α–driven mitochondrial biogenesis, upregulation of chaperones like GRP75, and stabilization of frataxin—constitutes the primary biochemical rationale for using leriglitazone to restore mitochondrial function and mitigate neurodegeneration in FRDA (Pandolfo et al., 2022; Pizcueta et al., 2023; Rodríguez-Pascau et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis under evaluation is that leriglitazone will selectively modulate PPARγ in FRDA iPSC-derived neurons, leading to a cascade of beneficial transcriptional events. In such a system, one would expect leriglitazone to robustly activate PPARγ, which then increases transcriptional output of PGC-1α. As PGC-1α levels rise, this should drive mitochondrial biogenesis and boost the expression of genes critical for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function. A direct downstream effect anticipated from this activation is the upregulation of mitochondrial chaperones such as GRP75, which facilitates the proper processing and stability of frataxin, the protein scarce in FRDA pathology. As frataxin levels become stabilized, the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters necessary for electron transport chain integrity can be improved, thereby restoring normal oxidative phosphorylation. Preclinical findings in FRDA fibroblasts have already shown that treatment with leriglitazone results in increased frataxin protein levels and improved bioenergetic profiles, suggesting that similar effects may be recapitulated in iPSC-derived neuronal models. In these neuronal assays, one would expect enhanced mitochondrial coupling efficiency, reduced production of reactive oxygen species, and decreased signs of mitochondrial stress. Given that neurons in FRDA patients suffer from impaired mitochondrial metabolism leading to neurodegeneration, the restoration of these pathways is likely to translate into improved neuronal survival, enhanced neurite outgrowth, and overall better cellular function. Supporting this hypothesis is the observation that other brain-penetrant agents targeting similar pathways have demonstrated increases in mitochondrial respiration and neuroprotection. Therefore, the expected effects of leriglitazone include not only biochemical and mitochondrial improvements but also measurable neurophysiological benefits in assays using FRDA patient-derived neuronal cultures (Edzeamey et al., 2024; Pizcueta et al., 2023; Rodríguez-Pascau et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
The comprehensive literature review indicates that leriglitazone is a highly promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia. One of its key strengths is its rational design as a synthetic PPARγ agonist with superior CNS penetration, which addresses a critical need in FRDA therapy given the disease’s prominent neurological manifestations. By selectively activating PPARγ, leriglitazone initiates a cascade that enhances PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis, upregulates mitochondrial chaperones like GRP75, and contributes to frataxin protein stabilization. This multi-level modulation of mitochondrial function directly targets the core pathogenic mechanisms of FRDA—mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and oxidative stress—suggesting that leriglitazone could restore cellular bioenergetics and improve clinical outcomes.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that treatment with leriglitazone increases frataxin protein levels in FRDA fibroblasts and improves bioenergetic markers, supporting the drug’s efficacy at the molecular level. Additionally, early clinical data in other CNS disorders, notably X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, confirm its ability to reach therapeutic concentrations in the brain and exhibit a tolerable safety profile. These observations, together with its well-defined mechanism of action, provide strong evidence of its potential benefit in FRDA. However, some limitations remain. The variability of frataxin level responses in different cell types—as observed with differential effects in neuronal versus cardiomyocyte models—is an important consideration, since FRDA pathology affects multiple tissues. Moreover, while the mechanistic rationale is robust, definitive clinical efficacy data specifically in FRDA patients are still emerging, and the potential for off-target effects common to the PPARγ agonist class (for example, fluid retention or weight gain) must be carefully monitored over longer treatment durations. Finally, the integration of transcriptional modulation, mitochondrial chaperone activity, and frataxin stabilization into a coherent, long-lasting therapeutic benefit remains to be validated in comprehensive phase II/III clinical trials.

In conclusion, based on the available biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature, leriglitazone represents a strong candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its design as a brain-penetrant PPARγ agonist makes it uniquely suited to overcome previous challenges encountered with conventional TZDs, and its ability to activate the PGC-1α pathway could translate into significant improvements in mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation. The therapeutic history of TZDs in related neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, combined with encouraging preclinical data in relevant FRDA models, further supports its potential. Nonetheless, future studies must confirm the extent to which leriglitazone can stabilize frataxin and modulate mitochondrial chaperones such as GRP75 in patient-derived neuronal networks, and whether these cellular improvements result in measurable clinical benefits. Overall, leriglitazone possesses several key strengths—including mechanistic specificity, CNS penetration, and translational progress—that justify its continued evaluation and development as a disease-modifying therapy for Friedreich’s Ataxia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Edzeamey et al., 2024; Pandolfo et al., 2022; Pizcueta et al., 2023; Rodríguez-Pascau et al., 2021).
