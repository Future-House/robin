Proposal for Sulforaphane (Cayman Cat#10005594)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate originally discovered in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower. It is typically extracted from broccoli sprouts and is available commercially (e.g., Cayman Cat#10005594). As an isothiocyanate, sulforaphane belongs to a class of phytochemicals that have garnered widespread attention for their chemopreventive, antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. This compound was initially identified through epidemiological studies linking high consumption of cruciferous vegetables to lower incidences of cancer. Over time, its potent ability to modulate redox-sensitive pathways has been increasingly appreciated in the context of neurological and mitochondrial disorders. In general, compounds of this class have been used both as dietary supplements and as lead candidates in drug development pipelines targeting oxidative stress–associated pathologies (Ding & Klomparens, 2019; Yang et al., 2025).

Therapeutic History:
Sulforaphane has an extensive preclinical history in the context of neurodegenerative and mitochondrial disorders. Multiple investigations have documented its beneficial effects in cellular models by attenuating oxidative stress, reducing the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and restoring mitochondrial function. In particular, sulforaphane has been shown to increase the expression of the transcription factor NRF2 and its target antioxidant enzymes such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and γ-glutamyl cysteine ligase (GCL). In a specific study focusing on neurological disorders, sulforaphane was demonstrated to increase NRF2 DNA binding through disruption of its inhibitory partner KEAP1, leading to upregulation of phase II detoxifying enzymes (Chang & Chen, 2024; Petrillo et al., 2017). Moreover, in models of Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) and related mitochondrial diseases, sulforaphane has been reported to not only activate NRF2 signaling but also to increase frataxin mRNA levels in patient-derived fibroblasts; such an effect would be critically important given that FRDA is characterized by frataxin deficiency and consequent mitochondrial dysfunction (Lew et al., 2022; Petrillo et al., 2019). Although the compound’s use in clinical trials for FRDA has not been as extensively documented as for some other diseases, its success in similar models and its favorable safety profile have rendered it a promising candidate for repurposing toward FRDA therapy (Keita et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
The principal mechanism of action of sulforaphane is its ability to activate the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway. Normally, NRF2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which targets NRF2 for proteasomal degradation. Sulforaphane covalently modifies key cysteine residues in KEAP1—particularly Cys151—thereby altering its conformation and preventing it from binding NRF2. This disruption allows NRF2 to stabilize and translocate into the nucleus, where it binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) present in the promoter regions of various phase II detoxifying and antioxidant genes (Petrillo et al., 2017; La Rosa et al., 2020). Once in the nucleus, NRF2 forms complexes with small Maf proteins and drives the expression of genes including NQO1, HO-1, superoxide dismutase isoforms (SOD1 and SOD2), and enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis and regeneration such as GCL, ultimately contributing to cellular defense against oxidative stress. In addition to its canonical role via KEAP1 modification, sulforaphane may also influence the epigenetic regulation of the NRF2 gene itself by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs), further potentiating NRF2-mediated transcriptional responses (Lew et al., 2022; Petrillo et al., 2017). Such dual activity—both alleviating the inhibitory effects of KEAP1 and modulating epigenetic regulators—underscores the compound’s robust ability to enhance cellular antioxidant capacity. This multifaceted activation of NRF2 has been observed to restore mitochondrial coupling efficiency and augment ATP production in various cellular models, thereby mitigating the energy deficits which are hallmarks of mitochondrial diseases, including FRDA (Ding & Klomparens, 2019; La Rosa et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for using sulforaphane in FRDA is that it will induce NRF2 nuclear translocation in FRDA fibroblasts. This NRF2 activation is expected to upregulate a suite of phase II detoxifying enzymes, such as NQO1, HO-1, and glutathione-synthesizing enzymes, which in turn would mitigate ROS-mediated damage. In FRDA, where frataxin deficiency leads to impaired mitochondrial function and enhanced oxidative stress, these actions are critically important. By normalizing aspects of mitochondrial function—specifically mitochondrial coupling efficiency and ATP production—sulforaphane is anticipated to improve cellular bioenergetics. There are reports that, in FRDA patient cells, sulforaphane treatment increases frataxin mRNA levels via engagement of the NRF2–ARE system, which is significant given that even modest upregulation of frataxin can have a therapeutic benefit (Petrillo et al., 2019; Lew et al., 2022). Additionally, by reducing the accumulation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and restoring reduced glutathione (GSH) content, the compound is expected to rebalance the redox state of the cells (Petrillo et al., 2017; Seco-Cervera et al., 2020). The convergence of enhanced antioxidant enzyme expression and the normalization of intracellular redox homeostasis should help mitigate the mitochondrial dysfunction and ensuing energy deficits critical in the pathogenesis of FRDA (Chang & Chen, 2024; La Rosa et al., 2020). In the proposed assay using patient-derived FRDA fibroblasts, one would expect an observable increase in nuclear NRF2, upregulation of downstream antioxidant gene transcripts, a reduction in markers of oxidative damage, and improved mitochondrial function metrics such as oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and ATP production (Lew et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Sulforaphane presents a promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on several converging lines of evidence. One of its greatest strengths lies in its natural origin and established safety profile. The fact that it is a dietary constituent and has been widely consumed in the form of cruciferous vegetables reduces the barrier to clinical translation and supports its potential use as a nutraceutical or adjunct to other therapies (Yang et al., 2025; Ding & Klomparens, 2019). Its robust mechanism of NRF2 activation, mediated through covalent modification of KEAP1 and potential epigenetic modulation, is well documented and offers a multi-target approach to attenuate oxidative stress—a central pathological process in FRDA (Petrillo et al., 2017; La Rosa et al., 2020). The expected biological effects—increased expression of antioxidant genes, restoration of redox balance, and normalization of mitochondrial function—address the major cellular deficits in FRDA patient cells. Furthermore, sulforaphane has been shown in preclinical studies to upregulate frataxin mRNA levels, which could translate into clinically meaningful improvements given the critical roles of frataxin in mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis and energy metabolism (Lew et al., 2022; Petrillo et al., 2019).

However, there are challenges and weaknesses that must be considered. Although preclinical data are very promising, clinical validation specifically in FRDA patients is still limited. The pharmacokinetic limitations of sulforaphane, such as its relatively poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability, may impede its effectiveness in vivo unless overcome by novel formulation strategies or improved delivery systems (Chang & Chen, 2024; Rufini et al., 2022). Moreover, while activation of the NRF2 pathway is critical for combating oxidative stress, this pathway is complex and tightly regulated, and there is always concern about potential off-target effects or unintended consequences of chronic NRF2 activation. The interplay between NRF2 and other signaling pathways could lead to variability in patient responses, particularly in a disease as multifactorial as FRDA (Petrillo et al., 2017; Tiberi et al., 2023). Another potential limitation is the indirect nature of its action on frataxin expression; while sulforaphane may increase frataxin mRNA levels via NRF2–ARE engagement, the overall impact on frataxin protein levels and functional activity within mitochondria remains to be definitively demonstrated (Lew et al., 2022; Petrillo et al., 2019). Lastly, the translation from preclinical models such as fibroblasts and neuronal cell lines to clinical efficacy in patients with FRDA is fraught with challenges, including differences in disease severity, patient heterogeneity, and the proper timing and dosing of the intervention (Keita et al., 2022; Strawser et al., 2017).

In summary, the overall evaluation of sulforaphane as a therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia is encouraging. The compound’s natural derivation, favorable safety profile, and well-characterized mechanism of NRF2 activation all support its potential to mitigate oxidative damage and improve mitochondrial function—a therapeutic strategy that directly addresses key aspects of FRDA pathology. However, to ensure a successful transition from bench to bedside, further studies must focus on optimizing its bioavailability, verifying its effects on frataxin protein levels in relevant FRDA models, and establishing robust clinical endpoints. The convergence of biochemical data and preclinical models suggests that, if formulation and delivery challenges can be overcome, sulforaphane might offer a viable approach to improve mitochondrial coupling efficiency, reduce ROS accumulation, and enhance ATP production in FRDA patients, thereby slowing or potentially halting disease progression (Chang & Chen, 2024; Petrillo et al., 2019; La Rosa et al., 2020). Overall, sulforaphane stands out as a promising repurposed drug candidate for FRDA, meriting further detailed investigation in targeted preclinical and eventual clinical studies.
