Proposal for Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is a naturally occurring nucleotide that is synthesized endogenously as an intermediate in the salvage pathway of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺) biosynthesis. NMN is formed primarily through the enzymatic action of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) on nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B₃, and is subsequently converted to NAD⁺ by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) enzymes. As such, NMN belongs to the class of NAD⁺ precursors, a group of molecules that have garnered considerable attention for their ability to boost intracellular NAD⁺ levels. This class also includes compounds like nicotinamide riboside (NR) and niacin (nicotinic acid). Historically, NAD⁺ precursors have been investigated both as dietary supplements and as pharmacological agents aimed at counteracting the decline in NAD⁺ levels observed during aging and in various metabolic diseases. Their use in preclinical models has been associated with improvements in metabolic function, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, and even protection from neurodegenerative changes. NMN, in particular, has been studied for its rapid uptake and conversion to NAD⁺, making it especially promising as a metabolic enhancer with potential applications in disorders characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) (Cantó et al., 2012; Massudi et al., 2012).

Therapeutic History:
The use of NAD⁺ intermediates has a rich preclinical history. NMN has been administered in animal models of mitochondrial disease, where its supplementation was shown to restore NAD⁺ pools, improve oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In various rodent studies, NMN administration improved mitochondrial function, enhanced ATP production, and provided significant protection against the metabolic derangements associated with aging and ischemic injury (Sims et al., 2018; Mendelsohn & Larrick, 2014). Additionally, NMN has been evaluated in several early-phase clinical studies which have consistently demonstrated its safety and its ability to increase blood NAD⁺ levels in healthy human subjects. For instance, clinical trials such as NCT04817111 and NCT05984550 have investigated the use of NAD⁺ precursors to modulate mitochondrial bioenergetics and immune cell function, providing important translational evidence that supports the mechanism of action seen in preclinical models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; McCormack, 2021; Shanghai Cell Therapy Group Co., Ltd., 2023). Although NMN has not been directly trialed in FRDA patients in published studies, related compounds such as niacin and nicotinamide have been applied in Friedreich’s Ataxia contexts. Specifically, nicotinamide was evaluated in open-label studies of FRDA, where it was shown to increase frataxin mRNA and protein levels, albeit without marked neurological improvement over short durations (Rufini et al., 2022). This historical background suggests that while NMN itself has a well-established safety and efficacy profile in terms of NAD⁺ boosting, its application to FRDA remains to be explored, making the current hypothesis highly compelling due to the mechanistic rationale drawn from both metabolic and mitochondrial models (Radenkovic et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
NMN acts as an immediate precursor in the NAD⁺ salvage pathway, thereby replenishing intracellular NAD⁺ pools that are essential for many cellular processes, including energy metabolism, DNA repair, and the regulation of gene expression. Once NMN is taken up by cells—potentially via transport mechanisms such as the recently identified Slc12a8 transporter—it is converted to NAD⁺ by NMNAT isoforms. Elevated levels of NAD⁺ then serve two critical roles. First, NAD⁺ functions as an essential redox coenzyme in metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), thereby driving ATP synthesis. Second, NAD⁺ acts as a necessary cofactor for a family of NAD⁺-dependent deacetylases known as sirtuins. Among these, SIRT3 is of particular interest because it is localized to the mitochondria and is known to directly regulate the acetylation status of mitochondrial proteins. Activation of SIRT3 leads to deacetylation of key mitochondrial enzymes, thereby enhancing their activity and improving overall mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics (Okabe et al., 2022; Mendelsohn & Larrick, 2014). In a cellular context relevant to Friedreich’s Ataxia—a disease marked by mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress—enhancing NAD⁺ levels via NMN supplementation would theoretically stimulate SIRT3 activity. This, in turn, would promote the deacetylation of multiple mitochondrial proteins involved in OXPHOS, leading to improved electron transport chain function, enhanced ATP production, and reduced generation of harmful ROS. The mechanistic detail extends to the observation that increased NAD⁺ levels help correct the redox imbalance (the NAD⁺/NADH ratio) seen during cellular stress, which is critical for maintaining ATP production efficiency (Sims et al., 2018; Srivastava, 2016).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis of the current proposal is that NMN administration in FRDA patient-derived fibroblasts will rapidly increase intracellular NAD⁺ levels, thereby boosting SIRT3 activity. In practice, this is expected to lead to enhanced deacetylation of mitochondrial OXPHOS enzymes, which are often hyperacetylated in conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction. The functional outcome of this deacetylation process would be an improvement in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, as measured by increases in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and enhanced ATP synthesis. In vitro assays using FRDA fibroblasts are anticipated to demonstrate these improvements with a concomitant reduction in oxidative stress markers, such as decreased ROS production. There is substantial evidence from animal models showing that NMN can indeed restore NAD⁺ levels, preserve mitochondrial respiration, and reduce oxidative stress in various tissues (Sims et al., 2018; Mendelsohn & Larrick, 2014). Additionally, given that SIRT3 is highly expressed in mitochondrial-rich tissues and is known to be critical for maintaining mitochondrial protein homeostasis, its activation in FRDA fibroblasts would further support the rationale that NMN will lead to a marked improvement in mitochondrial function (Okabe et al., 2022; Radenkovic et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, NMN appears to be a highly promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on several lines of evidence drawn from biochemical, clinical, and preclinical research. The strengths of NMN as a candidate lie in its well-defined role as an NAD⁺ precursor, its ability to rapidly increase intracellular NAD⁺ levels, and its demonstrated capacity to enhance mitochondrial function by activating SIRT3 and other NAD⁺-dependent enzymes. Preclinical evidence from animal models has consistently shown that NMN administration improves oxygen consumption, reduces oxidative stress, and enhances ATP production, all of which are particularly relevant in the context of FRDA, a disorder characterized by significant mitochondrial dysfunction (Sims et al., 2018; Mendelsohn & Larrick, 2014). In terms of safety, early-phase clinical trials with NMN in healthy subjects have reported good tolerability and effective NAD⁺ boosting, which provides a strong translational foundation for its further evaluation in patient populations (Okabe et al., 2022; Fukamizu et al., 2022).

However, there are also some challenges and weaknesses to consider. While there is ample evidence supporting the NAD⁺ boosting and mitochondrial enhancing properties of NMN in healthy individuals and in various disease models, there is currently a lack of direct clinical evidence for its efficacy in Friedreich’s Ataxia. The unique pathophysiology of FRDA, which includes frataxin deficiency, aberrant iron metabolism, and pronounced oxidative stress, may pose additional hurdles that are not fully addressed by NAD⁺ elevation alone. Furthermore, although NAD⁺ precursors such as nicotinamide have been evaluated in FRDA with some promising molecular endpoints, the translation of these findings into functional neurological improvements remains uncertain, as highlighted by short-duration studies that failed to show significant neurological benefits (Rufini et al., 2022). Another consideration is the tissue-specific uptake and metabolism of NMN. For example, while NMN is effective at increasing NAD⁺ in blood and liver, it may have variable efficacy in skeletal muscle and neural tissues, which are critical targets in FRDA. The potential inability of NMN to robustly penetrate certain tissues or cell types, and the possibility of differing enzyme expression profiles (e.g., NAMPT and NMNAT isoforms) in FRDA patient-derived fibroblasts compared to healthy cells, represent areas that require further investigation (Mendelsohn & Larrick, 2014; Radenkovic et al., 2020).

Despite these challenges, the overall mechanistic rationale—based on the restoration of NAD⁺ levels, activation of SIRT3, and subsequent improvements in mitochondrial bioenergetics—remains compelling. Given that FRDA is fundamentally a disease of mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress, targeting the NAD⁺ metabolism pathway with NMN offers a novel therapeutic approach that could complement existing interventions. Future studies will need to focus on optimizing dosing regimens, assessing tissue-specific uptake, and evaluating long-term effects on both biochemical and clinical endpoints in FRDA patients. Comparative studies with other NAD⁺ precursors, such as nicotinamide riboside, could also help elucidate whether NMN has unique advantages in terms of efficacy or safety in the FRDA context (Radenkovic et al., 2020; Srivastava, 2016).

In summary, NMN represents a well-rationalized and promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its natural origin as a key NAD⁺ intermediate, extensive preclinical evidence of enhancing mitochondrial function through SIRT3 activation, and confirmed safety in early-phase human trials provide strong support for its further evaluation in FRDA. The primary strengths of NMN lie in its ability to rapidly replenish intracellular NAD⁺, thereby improving oxidative phosphorylation and reducing oxidative damage. However, its potential limitations include the need for more robust and disease-specific clinical data and possible challenges related to tissue-specific pharmacodynamics in FRDA patients. Taken together, the available evidence encourages further investigation of NMN as a therapeutic strategy for mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction in Friedreich’s Ataxia, with the expectation that NMN-induced NAD⁺ elevation will lead to improved SIRT3 activity, enzyme deacetylation, and ultimately enhanced ATP synthesis in affected fibroblasts and other relevant cell types (Okabe et al., 2022; Sims et al., 2018; Rufini et al., 2022).
