Proposal for Nicotinamide riboside (Niagen; ChromaDex)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a naturally occurring form of vitamin B3 that has garnered considerable interest as a direct precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). NR is naturally present in small quantities in milk and certain vegetables; however, its significance lies in its capacity to boost intracellular NAD+ levels when provided exogenously. Given that NAD+ is an essential coenzyme necessary for redox reactions, DNA repair, and metabolic regulation, NR occupies a unique niche among the nicotinamide derivative class of compounds. Industrial production of NR is performed via controlled microbial fermentation and chemical synthesis routes that yield high-purity material suitable for dietary supplementation as well as for clinical applications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). As a member of the NAD+ precursor class, NR is distinct from other vitamin B3 analogs such as niacin and nicotinamide due to its metabolic pathway which bypasses some of the intermediary steps required by the latter molecules, leading to more efficient augmentation of NAD+ pools. This class of compounds has previously been employed in several preclinical studies focused on aging and metabolic dysfunction; the underlying rationale has been to ameliorate deficiencies in mitochondrial function and to counteract the decline in NAD+ levels associated with age-related disease. Moreover, the biochemical and pharmacological properties of NR, including its oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile as demonstrated in early-phase clinical studies, make it an attractive candidate for repurposing towards the treatment of mitochondrial and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
The history of NR as a therapeutic candidate extends back over recent years during which it has been extensively tested in multiple models of aging, metabolic dysfunction, and mitochondrial disease. Preclinical studies have consistently shown that NR supplementation leads to increases in NAD+ levels across various tissues, a change that tends to correlate with improvements in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and overall bioenergetic homeostasis. For example, in experimental animal models of obesity and heart failure, administration of NR not only increased NAD+ levels but was also associated with enhanced mitochondrial DNA copy numbers and improved oxidative metabolism (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Similar results have been observed in preclinical studies that evaluated NR’s capacity to enhance mitochondrial function in models of neurodegeneration and muscle pathology. Early-phase clinical trials in humans have evaluated NR in populations with metabolic derangements, including obese individuals and patients with mitochondrial myopathies. These studies have provided evidence of oral bioavailability and a strong safety profile while also demonstrating a measurable increase in circulating NAD+ levels (Lloret & Beal, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, NR has been examined in recent clinical trials specifically targeting mitochondrial diseases and neurodegenerative conditions. For instance, trials such as NCT04192136 and NCT03432871 have explored the utility of NR in patient cohorts where mitochondrial dysfunction is a key component of the pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017). One trial at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia combined NR supplementation with exercise training in Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) patients to assess changes in aerobic capacity and metabolic biomarkers. Although these studies are largely focused on short-term biomarkers of mitochondrial function and safety, they provide a strong foundation to support NR’s further development as a therapeutic for disorders characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, including Friedreich’s Ataxia (Rufini et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, the mechanism of action of nicotinamide riboside is both well characterized and compelling in the context of mitochondrial disease. Once ingested, NR is absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract and enters the systemic circulation. Within target cells, NR is phosphorylated by nicotinamide riboside kinases – NRK1 and NRK2 – to generate nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NMN is then transformed into NAD+ by NMN adenylyltransferases. The net effect of this metabolic cascade is a robust elevation in intracellular NAD+ levels (Lloret & Beal, 2019). NAD+ serves as a substrate for several groups of enzymes, most notably the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases. Among the sirtuins, SIRT1—largely nuclear—and SIRT3—which is primarily mitochondrial—play critical roles in regulating mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis. When SIRT1 is activated by increased NAD+ levels, it deacetylates and activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), which is widely recognized as the master transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. Once activated, PGC-1α promotes the transcription of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, thereby leading to an increase in both the number and function of mitochondria. Concurrently, SIRT3 acts within the mitochondria by deacetylating key enzymes involved in the electron transport chain, which not only enhances oxidative phosphorylation efficiency but also improves the mitochondrial antioxidant defenses, notably by activating manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) (Marmolino et al., 2010). In the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, the deficiency of frataxin—a mitochondrial protein essential for iron-sulfur cluster assembly—compromises several iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes of the electron transport chain, leading to both bioenergetic failure and oxidative damage. By replenishing NAD+ levels, NR is proposed to act via the SIRT1/3–PGC-1α axis, thereby driving mitochondrial biogenesis, improving oxidative phosphorylation, and reducing oxidative stress. This cascade is supported by preclinical evidence in which boosting NAD+ levels resulted in increased mitochondrial DNA copy number, enhanced oxygen consumption, and reduced production of reactive oxygen species (Lloret & Beal, 2019; Koňaříková et al., 2020). In essence, the molecular actions of NR target a fundamental weakness in FRDA’s pathology – mitochondrial dysfunction – by reactivating key enzymes and transcriptional programs that are compromised in the diseased state.

Expected Effect:
Friedreich’s Ataxia is marked primarily by the loss of frataxin leading to impaired iron-sulfur cluster formation, reduced activity of key mitochondrial enzymes, and a consequent bioenergetic failure alongside increased oxidative stress. The administration of NR is expected to increase intracellular NAD+ concentrations, which in turn should activate NAD+-dependent deacetylases like SIRT1 and SIRT3. Through the activation of these sirtuins, NR supplementation is anticipated to promote the deacetylation and functional activation of PGC-1α, which will stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis. As a result, one would expect to observe an increase in mitochondrial DNA copy number as well as improvements in markers of mitochondrial function such as oxygen consumption rates, ATP production, and general bioenergetics. Additionally, the enhanced activity of SIRT3 is expected to lead to increased deacetylation of mitochondrial enzymes responsible for antioxidant defenses, thereby contributing to a reduction in reactive oxygen species and overall oxidative stress (Poddar et al., 2019). In functional cellular assays using FRDA patient-derived neurons or muscle cells, one would predict that NR will restore the bioenergetic capacity of these cells, reflected in enhanced mitochondrial respiration and improved viability under metabolic stress. These cellular-level changes should ideally translate into clinically observable improvements such as stabilization or improvement in neuromuscular coordination and a slowing in the progression of ataxia symptoms. Moreover, in clinical trials that include biomarkers of mitochondrial health, we anticipate that NR supplementation would demonstrate measurable increases in NAD+ levels in blood and possibly in relevant tissues, along with surrogate endpoints of mitochondrial function. The central hypothesis is that by correcting the bioenergetic deficit through a mechanism that drives mitochondrial biogenesis and enhances oxidative phosphorylation, NR will counteract a primary defect of FRDA, thereby offering neuroprotective benefits and improving patient outcomes (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
Nicotinamide riboside represents a scientifically robust and attractive candidate for repurposing as a treatment for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Several strengths support this evaluation. First, the mode of action of NR is clearly defined; by serving as a direct precursor to NAD+, NR is able to elevate intracellular NAD+ levels, thereby driving the activity of crucial NAD+-dependent enzymes such as SIRT1 and SIRT3. Activation of these sirtuins leads to deacetylation of PGC-1α, which in turn enhances mitochondrial biogenesis. This molecular pathway is particularly relevant given that the hallmark of FRDA is mitochondrial dysfunction precipitated by frataxin deficiency. Preclinical studies in diverse models of mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration have provided evidence that augmenting NAD+ levels results in improved mitochondrial function, enhanced ATP production, and reduced oxidative stress (Lloret & Beal, 2019; Marmolino et al., 2010). The biomolecular rationale is compelling in that NR directly addresses the energetic failure at the heart of FRDA pathology.

Second, early-phase clinical trials have already provided a strong indication that NR is safe and well tolerated in humans, with an oral bioavailability that supports both ease of administration and favorable patient compliance. Trials examining metabolic health in (pre)obese individuals have indicated that NR can be safely administered and shall lead to measurable increases in NAD+ levels (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, additional studies focused on mitochondrial diseases and neurodegenerative conditions (such as the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust trial) support NR’s potential to enhance mitochondrial function in affected patient populations (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017).

Third, there is a significant body of preclinical literature that speaks directly to the expected biochemical improvements resulting from NAD+ precursor supplementation. Studies have shown that NR supplementation leads to upregulation of mitochondrial DNA copy number, enhanced oxygen consumption, and improved metabolic profiles in cells subjected to mitochondrial stress. For instance, in models of neurodegeneration and in cardiac muscle-specific dysfunctions, elevated NAD+ levels following NR supplementation have correlated with improved mitochondrial and cellular function (Poddar et al., 2019). Such improvements in mitochondrial biomarkers are promising, given that similar changes may be anticipated in FRDA wherein bioenergetic failure is a major component of disease progression.

Despite these strengths, several challenges and limitations exist. Although there is abundant rationale from preclinical studies and early clinical trials in other conditions, direct clinical evidence in Friedreich’s Ataxia patients is not yet robust. Many clinical studies have thus far focused on surrogate endpoints such as biochemical markers (e.g., NAD+ levels, mitochondrial DNA copy number) rather than on hard clinical outcomes such as motor function or ataxia progression. Therefore, while NR’s capacity to improve mitochondrial markers is well supported, the translation of these improvements into clinically meaningful endpoints in FRDA remains to be established in large-scale, targeted clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Another consideration is that FRDA is a multifactorial disease that, in addition to mitochondrial dysfunction, involves epigenetic silencing of the frataxin gene, disruptions in iron metabolism, and other cellular stress responses. It is possible that a monotherapy approach solely based on NR-induced NAD+ elevation may not be sufficient to fully reverse or halt the progression of FRDA. There may be a requirement for combination therapies that address both the bioenergetic deficits and the gene regulatory anomalies associated with frataxin deficiency. Hence, while NR is a promising candidate, its therapeutic benefit might be optimized when used together with complementary agents that target other aspects of FRDA pathogenesis.

Additionally, although the safety profile of NR is encouraging over short-term administration, Friedreich’s Ataxia is a chronic disease, and patients may require lifelong treatment. As such, long-term safety and tolerability data specific to chronic use in the context of neurodegeneration are still needed. It will be critical to determine not only whether NR can sustainably elevate NAD+ levels over years but also whether such elevations consistently correlate with meaningful clinical improvements over extended periods of treatment (Rufini et al., 2022).

Furthermore, while preclinical results in animal models have been promising, establishing reliable biomarkers that bridge the gap between improved mitochondrial function in laboratory assays and observable clinical improvement in neuromuscular coordination remains a challenge. The heterogeneity of mitochondrial dysfunction in FRDA patients means that robust and reproducible biomarker studies are required to stratify patients and monitor therapeutic outcomes. Such biomarkers might include measurements of NAD+ levels, mitochondrial DNA copy number, oxygen consumption rates, and assessments of oxidative stress in both peripheral tissues and the central nervous system. Only by correlating these biomarkers with clinical improvements in motor function and other quality-of-life measures can the full therapeutic potential of NR be validated.

In summary, NR has several attractive features that support its candidacy as a repurposed drug for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its ability to elevate NAD+ levels and activate key mitochondrial regulatory pathways—including the SIRT1/3–PGC-1α axis—is directly aligned with the known pathophysiology of FRDA, where mitochondrial dysfunction is a central defect. The extensive preclinical evidence demonstrating that NAD+ precursors can ameliorate bioenergetic deficits and protect against oxidative stress, combined with the encouraging safety and bioavailability data from early-phase clinical studies in other conditions, make NR a scientifically compelling candidate for further investigation in FRDA populations (Lloret & Beal, 2019; Marmolino et al., 2010).

At the same time, the current limitations must be acknowledged. Direct clinical efficacy data in FRDA is still sparse, and the complexity of FRDA’s multifactorial pathogenesis may necessitate multi-targeted therapeutic strategies beyond simply boosting NAD+. Long-term studies are required to understand the chronic effects of NR supplementation in neurodegenerative settings. Additionally, the development and validation of clinically relevant biomarkers that can accurately predict therapeutic success in FRDA patients will be critical to advancing NR from a promising candidate to an established treatment.

Overall, given the strong mechanistic rationale, favorable safety profile, and encouraging preclinical findings, NR is a promising candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its mechanism—elevating NAD+ to activate sirtuin-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis—addresses a fundamental aspect of FRDA pathophysiology, and there is a robust body of evidence supporting this approach in other models of mitochondrial dysfunction (Lloret & Beal, 2019; Poddar et al., 2019). However, advancing NR into large-scale, controlled clinical trials specifically targeting FRDA will be essential to determine whether improvements in mitochondrial biomarkers translate into meaningful clinical benefits such as improved motor coordination, slowed disease progression, and enhanced quality of life for patients. Continued investment in both mechanistic studies and clinical investigations is therefore warranted to explore the full potential of nicotinamide riboside as a therapeutic option for Friedreich’s Ataxia (Rufini et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

In conclusion, the repurposing of nicotinamide riboside (Niagen; ChromaDex) for Friedreich’s Ataxia is a scientifically compelling proposition that builds on decades of research into NAD+ metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. The preclinical evidence robustly supports the notion that elevating NAD+ levels can activate key mitochondrial biogenesis pathways through sirtuin-mediated deacetylation of PGC-1α and improve cellular energy metabolism. Early-phase clinical studies in related diseases further underscore NR’s safety, oral bioavailability, and ability to favorably modulate metabolic endpoints. Nonetheless, the complexity of FRDA pathogenesis, which includes frataxin deficiency, iron dysregulation, and epigenetic alterations in addition to mitochondrial dysfunction, suggests that NR might be most effective when used as part of a combination therapeutic strategy. Large, well-controlled long-term clinical trials focusing specifically on FRDA are needed in order to determine the extent to which NR-induced improvements in mitochondrial biomarkers translate into meaningful clinical benefits for patients. Given these considerations, nicotinamide riboside stands out as an attractive candidate that merits further rigorous evaluation in the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, and its development could potentially provide a much-needed therapeutic intervention for this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder (Lloret & Beal, 2019; Marmolino et al., 2010; Rufini et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).
