Proposal for Urolithin A

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Urolithin A is a naturally occurring gut microbiota‐derived metabolite produced via the conversion of ellagitannins and ellagic acid found in foods such as pomegranates, berries, and nuts. The generation of Urolithin A is mediated by specific bacterial species present in the human gut (Djedjibegovic et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022). Belonging to the class of polyphenol-derived postbiotics, Urolithin A has attracted considerable attention owing to its capacity to modulate mitochondrial function and quality through the activation of mitophagy. The discovery of Urolithin A has been closely linked to studies of dietary polyphenols and the role of the gut microbiome in generating bioactive metabolites; these investigations revealed that only a subset of individuals are capable of converting dietary ellagitannins into Urolithin A, while exogenous supplementation could overcome this limitation (Kothe et al., 2023). As a naturally derived compound, Urolithin A exemplifies a nutraceutical agent with a dual role; it is both a marker of a healthy gut microbial ecosystem and an active inducer of mitochondrial turnover. The compound is not synthesized chemically on a large scale in most cases; rather, it is isolated or produced through fermentation approaches that mimic microbial conversion processes. Historically, this class of compounds has been employed to target age-related declines in mitochondrial function, with various studies demonstrating beneficial effects in restoring mitochondrial respiration and increasing oxidative phosphorylation metrics in aged animal models. This background places Urolithin A as a promising candidate for repurposing to address mitochondrial dysfunction inherent to neurodegenerative disorders such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (Faitg et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Biochemically, Urolithin A has been evaluated in preclinical studies and early phase clinical trials principally in the context of age-associated muscle decline and metabolic dysfunction. Clinical trials, such as those examining its effects on mitochondrial bioenergetics in older adults (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019), have demonstrated that Urolithin A is well-tolerated in humans with a favorable safety profile. These studies have provided robust pharmacokinetic data that indicate dose-dependent increases in plasma concentrations, a moderately long half-life, and significant bioavailability when administered orally (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019). Although its application in Friedreich's Ataxia has not been directly tested—there are no registered clinical trials using Urolithin A for FRDA specifically (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—the compound’s history in addressing mitochondrial decline in muscle tissue offers a strong rationale for its repurposing. In various animal and cell-based models of mitochondrial dysfunction, Urolithin A has been shown to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, improve oxygen consumption rates (OCR), and stimulate key pathways involved in mitochondrial turnover by enhancing mitophagy (Li et al., 2022; Pradeepkiran et al., 2022). Its therapeutic history thus far has been primarily in contexts related to aging, metabolic disorders, and neuroprotective applications in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease models, where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key pathological role. Therefore, while Urolithin A has not been used directly in FRDA, its repurposing for diseases marked by mitochondrial impairments, such as Friedreich’s Ataxia, is supported by a strong foundation of preclinical and early clinical data demonstrating its ability to modulate mitochondrial health (Sorrentino et al., 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
The central mechanism of action of Urolithin A lies in its capacity to induce mitophagy – the selective autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria. At the molecular level, it acts by upregulating key proteins involved in the PINK1/Parkin pathway, a critical regulatory cascade for mitochondrial quality control. Under conditions of mitochondrial depolarization, the serine/threonine kinase PINK1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane. PINK1 then phosphorylates ubiquitin and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, leading to the recruitment of autophagy receptors that tag damaged mitochondria for degradation via the autophagosome–lysosome pathway (Pradeepkiran et al., 2022; Stepanova & Magrané, 2020). In cellular studies, Urolithin A has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the accumulation of phosphorylated Parkin and other mitophagy markers, thereby promoting the proper recycling of dysfunctional mitochondria and the biogenesis of healthy organelles. This molecular cascade results in increased maximal OCR and coupling efficiency, which reflects overall improvements in mitochondrial respiratory capacity and energy production. In addition to activating the PINK1/Parkin axis, Urolithin A has been shown to modulate other signaling pathways such as AMPK signaling and to upregulate mitochondrial biogenesis factors, including PGC-1α, ultimately fostering an environment conducive to mitochondrial renewal and enhanced cellular bioenergetics (Djedjibegovic et al., 2020; Kothe et al., 2023). Moreover, studies in models of age-related muscle decline have shown that Urolithin A decreases oxidative stress and reduces mitochondrial damage by functioning as a potent antioxidant that indirectly supports mitochondrial health (Faitg et al., 2024). Given that FRDA pathophysiology is characterized by frataxin deficiency leading to defective iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis, excess ROS generation, and impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, the mitophagy-enhancing and mitochondrial-renewing properties of Urolithin A are particularly applicable. It is expected that by promoting the PINK1/Parkin-mediated removal of damaged mitochondria, Urolithin A can reset mitochondrial quality control and restore bioenergetic capacity in FRDA neurons (Hayashi & Cortopassi, 2015).

Expected Effect:
Based on the preclinical evidence accumulated from studies in aging muscle and neurodegenerative models, the hypothesis for employing Urolithin A in Friedreich’s Ataxia is that it will induce mitophagy via the PINK1/Parkin pathway in affected FRDA neurons. In this context, the compound is expected to facilitate the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria that accumulate as a consequence of frataxin deficiency, thereby triggering compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis. The net effect would be a restoration of mitochondrial coupling efficiency and maximal OCR – key measures of mitochondrial respiratory function – which are typically compromised in FRDA due to impaired iron-sulfur cluster formation (Pradeepkiran et al., 2022; Stepanova & Magrané, 2020). The improved mitochondrial turnover would also lead to a reduction in ROS levels as damaged, ROS-producing mitochondrial components are removed from the cellular environment, thus alleviating oxidative stress. Importantly, FRDA neurons, like other postmitotic cells, are highly reliant on robust mitochondrial function for energy generation and survival. Given that studies have documented the expression of key mitophagy regulators such as PINK1 and Parkin in neurons, and that mitochondrial dysfunction is a core component of FRDA pathology (Hayashi & Cortopassi, 2015), it is reasonable to expect that Urolithin A will exert a neuroprotective effect in FRDA by restoring mitochondrial homeostasis. In vitro assays using FRDA-derived neuronal cell lines or patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are likely to reveal improvements in bioenergetic parameters, such as increased OCR and ATP production, lower oxidative damage, and elevated expression levels of mitochondrial biogenesis markers after Urolithin A treatment (Pradeepkiran et al., 2022; Kothe et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of Urolithin A as a therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia is promising but remains at a preclinical and translational stage. Its major strengths include a well-documented mechanism of action that addresses one of the central pathological features of FRDA—mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired mitophagy. Multiple preclinical studies have demonstrated that Urolithin A is capable of activating the PINK1/Parkin pathway, resulting in enhanced clearance of damaged mitochondria and stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis (Pradeepkiran et al., 2022; Sorrentino et al., 2018). Additionally, favorable safety profiles from nutritional clinical studies, along with robust pharmacokinetic data, support its potential for rapid translation to human use (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019). Another key advantage is the dual nature of Urolithin A: not only does it promote the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria, but it also induces the generation of new, functional organelles, which is critical in diseases marked by severe mitochondrial impairment such as FRDA.

However, there are notable weaknesses and gaps that must be addressed before Urolithin A can be validated specifically for FRDA treatment. There is an absence of direct clinical or preclinical evidence examining Urolithin A’s effects in FRDA models or patient-derived cells. The existing clinical trials have been limited to healthy adults and conditions primarily related to muscle aging or metabolic dysfunction, rather than neurodegenerative or mitochondrial diseases such as FRDA (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, while the mechanistic hypothesis centered on PINK1/Parkin activation is strongly supported by studies in other disease contexts, it remains to be confirmed whether FRDA neurons respond similarly to Urolithin A supplementation. This represents a critical gap in the literature, as FRDA’s mitochondrial pathology has unique features that may require tailored dosing or combination therapies. Additionally, although Urolithin A has been described as having antioxidant properties and the ability to reduce ROS, the extent to which these effects directly translate to improved neurologic outcomes in FRDA is not yet established. Future research should focus on rigorous in vitro studies using FRDA-relevant cell lines and in vivo animal models that recapitulate the frataxin deficiency seen in patients. Such studies should aim to measure not only bioenergetic parameters, but also improvements in neuronal survival, oxidative stress markers, and motor function to provide a comprehensive evaluation of therapeutic potential.

In summary, Urolithin A represents a highly promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia due to its dual action in promoting mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis via the PINK1/Parkin pathway, its capacity to reduce oxidative stress, and its favorable safety profile established in human studies. The convergence of biochemical, preclinical, and early clinical data supports the hypothesis that enhancing the turnover of damaged mitochondria in FRDA could restore cellular energy homeostasis and mitigate disease progression. The strengths of Urolithin A lie in its natural origin, acceptable pharmacokinetics, and robust mechanistic evidence in related mitochondrial dysfunction models (Djedjibegovic et al., 2020; Pradeepkiran et al., 2022). However, its weaknesses include the current lack of direct evidence in FRDA models and the need to confirm that neuronal mitochondrial quality control systems in FRDA can be reactivated by this compound to a therapeutically relevant extent (Hayashi & Cortopassi, 2015). Based on the available literature, further targeted preclinical studies and subsequent clinical trials in FRDA patients are warranted to validate the therapeutic potential of Urolithin A for this indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kothe et al., 2023).
