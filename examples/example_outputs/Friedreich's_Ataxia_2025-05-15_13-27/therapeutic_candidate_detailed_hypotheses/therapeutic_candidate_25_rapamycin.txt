Proposal for Rapamycin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rapamycin is a naturally occurring lipophilic macrolide originally isolated from the bacterium *Streptomyces hygroscopicus*. Initially discovered for its antifungal properties, rapamycin was later found to have potent immunosuppressive and antiproliferative activities. It belongs to the class of mTOR inhibitors and is most commonly classified as an allosteric inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). The compound was synthesized and characterized following its discovery in environmental samples, and its structure–activity relationships have been extensively explored. Over the years, rapamycin has been employed in diverse clinical contexts—most notably as an immunosuppressant in organ transplantation and as an agent to prevent restenosis after coronary interventions. In recent decades, its potential as an anti-aging agent and neuroprotective therapy has garnered significant attention. This class of compounds has historically been used to modulate nutrient-sensing pathways, regulate protein synthesis, and induce autophagy, making rapamycin a particularly attractive candidate for diseases with underlying mitochondrial dysfunction and proteostatic stress (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2009).

Therapeutic History:
Rapamycin has a robust therapeutic history. Clinically, it is FDA-approved as an immunosuppressant for preventing organ transplant rejection and has been utilized in oncology due to its antiproliferative properties. Its use has extended into experimental models of neurodegeneration where it has demonstrated neuroprotective effects, largely attributed to its ability to promote autophagy and clear misfolded or aggregated proteins. Preclinical studies in neurodegenerative contexts—including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease models—have shown that rapamycin ameliorates cellular stress by enhancing cellular recycling processes (Pan et al., 2009; Wong, 2013). Specifically for Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA), clinical trial databases indicate that no direct clinical trials with rapamycin have been conducted to date (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, compelling preclinical evidence exists in Drosophila models of FRDA, where rapamycin-mediated inhibition of TORC1 improved motor performance, increased lifespan, reduced oxidative damage markers, and improved mitochondrial function (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015). Moreover, in frataxin-deficient yeast models, rapamycin treatment reduced oxidative stress via enhanced mitophagy and clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria (Marobbio et al., 2012). Thus, while rapamycin has not been directly tested in FRDA patients, its efficacy in related models of mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration provides a strong rationale for its repurposing.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, rapamycin exerts its biological effect by forming a complex with the intracellular receptor FKBP12, which then binds to and inhibits mTORC1. mTORC1 is a serine/threonine kinase that integrates signals from nutrients, growth factors, and cellular energy status to regulate protein synthesis, lipid biosynthesis, and autophagy. Under normal conditions, active mTORC1 phosphorylates downstream targets such as S6 kinase (S6K) and the eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BP), thereby promoting protein synthesis and inhibiting autophagy. Rapamycin’s binding to FKBP12 interferes with the kinase activity of mTORC1, leading to dephosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP, which in turn promotes the induction of autophagy and, more specifically, mitophagy—the selective clearance of damaged mitochondria (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015; Marobbio et al., 2012). In models of FRDA, where frataxin deficiency leads to impaired iron–sulfur cluster synthesis, mitochondrial iron overload, and oxidative stress, these processes contribute to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. By activating autophagy, rapamycin enhances mitochondrial quality control, reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and may improve mitochondrial membrane potential and spare respiratory capacity. Evidence in Drosophila FRDA models supports the notion that the neuroprotective effects of rapamycin are mediated not solely through autophagy induction under normoxic conditions but also via improved ATP availability through modulation of translation regulators such as 4E-BP (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015). This mechanistic detail is further reinforced by studies indicating that mTOR inhibition can lead to enhanced nuclear translocation of antioxidant transcription factors (e.g., cap-n-collar, the Drosophila ortholog of Nrf2), thereby upregulating the expression of antioxidant genes and mitigating oxidative stress (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015). Additionally, preclinical work in yeast models has shown that rapamycin treatment results in reduced mitochondrial mass and decreased protein carbonylation, pointing to its effectiveness in reducing oxidative damage (Marobbio et al., 2012).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis posits that in FRDA patient-derived fibroblasts, rapamycin will inhibit mTORC1 signaling, which is anticipated to trigger a cascade of beneficial cellular processes. First, the inhibition of mTORC1 is expected to relieve its repression on autophagy. As a result, autophagic flux, and in particular mitophagy, should be enhanced. This will promote the clearance of damaged mitochondria, resulting in improved mitochondrial quality control and a reduction in accumulated oxidative damage. Restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential is anticipated due to the reduction in ROS levels and the removal of defective mitochondria, which compromises normal electron transport chain function. Consequently, these effects should normalize oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and bolster ATP production as functional mitochondria repopulate the cellular environment. Supporting evidence in Drosophila models of FRDA showed that rapamycin treatment normalized markers of lipid peroxidation such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxyalkenals, as well as total glutathione levels, which are reflective of improved oxidative stress parameters (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015). In parallel, studies in yeast models have demonstrated that rapamycin reduces ROS production and decreases mitochondrial mass, further indicating a remodeling of mitochondrial turnover (Marobbio et al., 2012). At the molecular level within FRDA fibroblasts, enhanced autophagic clearance should also be accompanied by restoration of mitochondrial biogenesis pathways, leading to an increase in spare respiratory capacity—a critical metric for cellular resilience under metabolic stress. Hence, rapamycin is expected to exert its beneficial effects by simultaneously reducing oxidative burden, enhancing mitochondrial dynamics, and promoting overall cellular energy homeostasis. This expectation is underpinned by the extensive preclinical literature demonstrating the neuroprotective and mitochondria-preserving effects of rapamycin in various models of mitochondrial and neurodegenerative disease (Pan et al., 2009; Calap-Quintana et al., 2015).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of rapamycin as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia is cautiously optimistic. One of the greatest strengths of rapamycin is its extensive preclinical and clinical record in other diseases, which provides a well-characterized safety and dosing profile. Its established ability to inhibit mTORC1 and induce autophagy and mitophagy positions it favorably for conditions like FRDA, where mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are central to pathology (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015; Marobbio et al., 2012). Preclinical models, particularly the Drosophila FRDA studies, offer encouraging data with improvements seen in motor function, lifespan, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress markers. This mechanistic consistency across different species and models underscores the biological plausibility that rapamycin could restore mitochondrial integrity in FRDA patient-derived cells. Moreover, the molecular interactions of rapamycin—namely its inhibition of mTORC1 via FKBP12—and its downstream effects on translation regulators and autophagy pathways have been rigorously detailed in the literature, lending strong support to the hypothesis that rapamycin will enhance mitochondrial quality control in FRDA (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015; Marobbio et al., 2012).

However, there are notable weaknesses and considerations that require further investigation. First, despite promising preclinical data, there is yet to be any direct clinical trial evidence of rapamycin’s efficacy in treating FRDA (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This gap in clinical data means that the translation of animal model results to human patients remains speculative. Additionally, some studies, such as those investigating the effects of diazoxide on frataxin expression, have highlighted that mTOR signaling can have a dual role; in certain contexts, mTOR activity appears necessary for the optimal expression of frataxin (Santoro et al., 2018). In such cases, the inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin could theoretically downregulate frataxin expression—a protein already deficient in FRDA—which might counteract some of its beneficial effects on mitochondrial turnover. Thus, the dosing regimen and target specificity of rapamycin will be critical to maximize its mitophagy-promoting and antioxidant-enhancing properties without inadvertently suppressing frataxin levels further. Another potential concern is the immunosuppressive effect of rapamycin, which, although well-characterized in transplant and oncology settings, could pose risks for long-term treatment in a chronic neurodegenerative disease. Nevertheless, the cumulative preclinical evidence suggests that at carefully titrated doses, rapamycin could strike a balance between efficacy and tolerability, especially with the possibility of intermittent dosing protocols that have been shown to extend lifespan and improve healthspan in other models (Siegmund et al., 2017; Harinath et al., 2024).

In summary, rapamycin has strong potential as a repurposed drug for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on its molecular mechanism of mTORC1 inhibition, which is expected to enhance autophagy and mitophagy, thereby clearing damaged mitochondria and reducing oxidative stress—a central pathology in FRDA. Its extensive therapeutic history in other indications underpins its favorable safety profile, and preclinical models have already demonstrated improvements in mitochondrial quality control with rapamycin treatment. However, the complexity of mTOR’s role in regulating frataxin expression and the necessity for precise dosing remain significant challenges that warrant further targeted studies in FRDA-specific models and patient-derived cells before progressing to clinical trials. Overall, while there is a strong mechanistic rationale and promising preclinical data supporting rapamycin’s use in FRDA, additional research is required to optimize its application and fully ascertain its therapeutic value in this context (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015; Marobbio et al., 2012; Pan et al., 2009).
