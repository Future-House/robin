Proposal for Mdivi-1

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Mdivi-1 is a small synthetic molecule originally discovered via high-throughput screening in yeast-based assays targeting mitochondrial fission proteins. It was first characterized as an inhibitor of the yeast dynamin‐related protein Dnm1 and later was repurposed as a putative inhibitor of mammalian dynamin‐related protein 1 (DRP1) based on sequence and functional homologies. As a quinazolinone derivative, its chemical structure—featuring aromatic rings and functional groups such as chloro and methoxy substituents—belongs to a class of small molecule inhibitors that modulate mitochondrial dynamics. Its discovery emerged from efforts to find compounds that “rescue” mitochondria from excessive fragmentation by interfering with the GTPase activity involved in DRP1’s self‐assembly and fission ability (Kim et al., 2013). This class of therapeutics, often termed mitochondrial division inhibitors, has been extensively employed in in vitro and in vivo models to study and modulate mitochondrial morphology in various contexts, including neurodegenerative disease and cancer. The compound’s chemical synthesis and optimization have been driven by the need for precise modulators of mitochondrial fission, and despite some controversies regarding its exact biochemical targets, Mdivi-1 remains an important tool for probing mitochondrial function and dynamics in experimental systems (Basei & Zorzano, 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Mdivi-1 has been widely used as a research tool in biomedical studies focusing on the role of mitochondrial fission in cellular homeostasis, apoptosis, and metabolic regulation. Historically, it was applied in models of ischemia-reperfusion injury where excessive DRP1-mediated fission contributes to tissue damage and cardiomyocyte death, and it provided protection against neuronal injury in various neurodegenerative disease models (Bordt et al., 2017). Additionally, DRP1 inhibitors including Mdivi-1 have been utilized in models of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and epilepsy, with studies demonstrating improvements in mitochondrial morphology, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and enhanced cell survival (Oliver & Reddy, 2019). While direct clinical applications in Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) have not been realized—clinical trial searches for Mdivi-1 in the context of FRDA yield only early-stage exploratory studies—there is a significant body of preclinical data supporting its utility in conditions where mitochondrial dysfunction is paramount (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In similar neurodegenerative disorders characterized by mitochondrial fragmentation and bioenergetic deficits, DRP1 inhibitors have shown promise by rebalancing mitochondrial dynamics and promoting overall cellular health (Deng et al., 2022). This positions Mdivi-1 as a potentially attractive candidate for repurposing in FRDA, a disease where frataxin deficiency leads to mitochondrial pathology including fragmentation and impaired respiration (Deng et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
Mdivi-1 was originally posited to function through the selective inhibition of DRP1’s GTPase activity, a critical enzyme function required for mitochondrial fission. DRP1, a dynamin-related GTPase, normally translocates from the cytosol to the mitochondria where it oligomerizes and forms ring-like structures around the mitochondrial outer membrane to initiate fission. Inhibition of DRP1 by Mdivi-1 was thought to occur through an allosteric mechanism that prevents the conformational changes and self-assembly necessary for its GTPase function, thereby reducing mitochondrial fragmentation and favoring a more elongated, fused network (Kim et al., 2013). However, subsequent studies have revealed that the mechanism of Mdivi-1 may be more complex than a simple DRP1 inhibitor. Evidence indicates that at commonly used concentrations, Mdivi-1 may also act by reversible inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, leading to modulation of ROS production and influencing cellular bioenergetics independently of direct DRP1 inhibition (Bordt et al., 2017; Marx et al., 2024). Despite these debates, numerous studies have demonstrated that treatment with Mdivi-1 results in a reduction of DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission, restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), improvements in oxygen consumption rates (OCR), and enhanced cell survival under oxidative stress conditions (Basei & Zorzano, 2023; Oliver & Reddy, 2019). The compound interferes with DRP1’s ability to hydrolyze GTP—a process essential for its fission activity—by binding either to allosteric sites or interfering with protein-protein interactions that facilitate its mitochondrial recruitment. Furthermore, the documented effects on mitochondrial dynamics have been supported by changes in the expression levels of fusion proteins such as mitofusins (Mfn1, Mfn2) and optic atrophy protein 1 (Opa1) in treated cells, suggesting a coordinated rebalancing of fission–fusion processes (Oliver & Reddy, 2019). Collectively, although controversies remain regarding the precise molecular target of Mdivi-1, the consensus is that its protective effects in various disease models are mediated, at least in part, by its capacity to inhibit DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation and thereby improve mitochondrial function (Deng et al., 2022; Koch & Traven, 2019).

Expected Effect:
In the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, where frataxin deficiency precipitates mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by excessive fission, reduced ATP production, and impaired oxidative phosphorylation, the treatment hypothesis posits that Mdivi-1 will restore the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion. By inhibiting DRP1’s fission-promoting activity, Mdivi-1 is expected to reduce pathological mitochondrial fragmentation observed in FRDA fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. This should lead to preservation or restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), enhancement of ATP-linked respiration, and improvement of maximal OCR, indicative of a more efficient and robust oxidative phosphorylation process (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Basei & Zorzano, 2023). Several studies using DRP1 inhibitors in neurodegenerative models have demonstrated increased cell viability and reduced apoptosis under conditions of oxidative or metabolic stress, outcomes that are directly relevant to the pathophysiologic mechanisms in FRDA (Reddy, 2014; Oliver & Reddy, 2019). Moreover, the expected molecular effects include improved mitophagy, which can allow for better quality control of damaged mitochondria, thereby indirectly contributing to enhanced bioenergetic capacity and mitigation of cellular stress. In the proposed assays, DRP1 expression is well established in FRDA fibroblasts and neuronal cells, affirming that these cells possess the requisite machinery for DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission. Consequently, the application of Mdivi-1 is anticipated to result in a shift towards mitochondrial elongation and improved network connectivity, correlating with increased respiratory function and cellular energy status (Yu et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Mdivi-1 emerges as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on its mechanistic rationale and extensive preclinical history. One of its major strengths lies in its established use as a research tool to modulate mitochondrial dynamics, along with a substantial body of evidence demonstrating that DRP1 inhibition can attenuate mitochondrial fragmentation, enhance mitochondrial respiration, and improve cell survival in various disease models (Oliver & Reddy, 2019; Reddy, 2014). Its known dosing ranges—from in vitro concentrations of 1 to 50 µM to effective in vivo applications in animal models—provide a solid foundation for translational studies in FRDA (Kim et al., 2013; Koch & Traven, 2019). The expected restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential and bioenergetic parameters in FRDA fibroblasts and iPSC-derived neurons aligns with the molecular hypothesis that reducing excessive DRP1-mediated fission will improve mitochondrial integrity and function in these cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Basei & Zorzano, 2023).

However, there are notable challenges and potential weaknesses that must be considered. Foremost among these is the ongoing controversy regarding Mdivi-1’s primary mechanism of action. Several studies suggest that its beneficial effects might be mediated through reversible inhibition of mitochondrial complex I rather than direct DRP1 inhibition (Bordt et al., 2017; Marx et al., 2024). This dual mechanism introduces complexity in interpreting the outcomes, as complex I inhibition may lead to off-target effects that could compromise mitochondrial function if not tightly regulated. Furthermore, despite promising preclinical data in other neurodegenerative and ischemia-related models, direct evidence of efficacy in Friedreich’s Ataxia models is limited, necessitating more rigorous testing (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Oliver & Reddy, 2019). The specificity of DRP1 inhibition by Mdivi-1 is also questioned by some reports where the compound does not fully recapitulate phenotypes observed by genetic knockdown of DRP1, suggesting that the compound’s effects might be context-dependent and variable across different cell types and disease models (Reddy, 2014; Zerihun et al., 2023).

Additionally, while Mdivi-1’s capacity to improve mitochondrial morphology is documented, the long-term consequences of chronic DRP1 inhibition remain unclear. Mitochondrial fission is an essential physiological process required for quality control, cell division, and adaptation to metabolic stress; therefore, its complete suppression might lead to unforeseen deleterious effects, particularly in tissues that rely heavily on mitochondrial turnover and energy production (Whitley et al., 2019; Sridharan, 2023). Safety, dosing optimization, and specificity of action are all critical parameters that need further validation in preclinical FRDA models. Moreover, given the complex interplay between mitochondrial biogenesis, fission, fusion, and mitophagy in FRDA pathogenesis, it will be important to ensure that Mdivi-1 not only prevents excessive fission but also permits adequate mitochondrial turnover and repair mechanisms (Ghani, 2025).

In summary, Mdivi-1 represents a candidate with a compelling mechanistic basis for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its strengths lie in its well-documented ability to modulate mitochondrial dynamics, improve mitochondrial function, and reduce oxidative stress in a variety of cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative disease. The transition of these benefits to FRDA models is supported by the observation that mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired bioenergetics are core pathological features of FRDA. Nonetheless, the controversial aspects of its mechanism—specifically, the potential contribution of complex I inhibition—and the need for further evidence regarding long-term safety and efficacy in FRDA-specific systems present challenges that must be addressed through rigorous preclinical testing before clinical translation can be confidently pursued (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Basei & Zorzano, 2023).

Overall, the repurposing of Mdivi-1 for FRDA is scientifically plausible and supported by a significant body of mechanistic and experimental data across multiple disease models. Its ability to inhibit DRP1-mediated fission and thereby rebalance mitochondrial dynamics offers a clear strategy to counteract the bioenergetic deficits observed in FRDA. However, the candidate’s dual mechanism of action, potential off-target effects, and the necessity for comprehensive efficacy and safety studies are critical areas that require further exploration. In our role as a drug development team, these considerations will inform the design of preclinical experiments aimed at rigorously testing Mdivi-1 in FRDA-specific models, with the ultimate goal of determining its viability as a therapeutic agent that can be translated into clinical studies for this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Marx et al., 2024; Oliver & Reddy, 2019).
