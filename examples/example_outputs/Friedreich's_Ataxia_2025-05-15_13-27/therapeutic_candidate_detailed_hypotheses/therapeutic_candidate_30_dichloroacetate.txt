Proposal for Dichloroacetate (DCA)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a low molecular weight (approximately 150 Da) small molecule originally discovered as a by-product of chlorination processes and later synthesized for its ability to modulate cellular metabolism. It belongs to the class of metabolic modulators that target key regulatory enzymes within the mitochondria. Specifically, DCA is known for its capacity to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), thereby removing the inhibitory phosphorylation from the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) and promoting its activity. Unlike many large, biologically derived molecules, DCA is a fully synthetic compound known for its high oral bioavailability and capacity to cross biological barriers, including the blood–brain barrier. This characteristic supports its investigation not only in metabolic diseases but also as a potential therapeutic in neurodegenerative conditions where mitochondrial dysfunction is a core pathology (Stacpoole et al., 2008; Michelakis et al., 2008). Over the years, compounds from this class have been used in various settings—ranging from the treatment of congenital lactic acidosis and other mitochondrial disorders to experimental applications in cancer therapy, where reactivation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation serves to counteract the Warburg effect in tumor cells (Kankotia & Stacpoole, 2014).

Therapeutic History:
DCA has an extensive history of investigational use in mitochondrial disorders. It has been administered in both clinical and preclinical settings to treat conditions characterized by impaired oxidative metabolism, particularly congenital lactic acidosis and primary defects in the PDH complex. Early studies have demonstrated that DCA decreases blood lactate levels by enhancing PDH activity; these studies provided proof-of-concept that augmenting mitochondrial oxidation via PDK inhibition can ameliorate metabolic derangements (Abdelmalak et al., 2013; Stacpoole et al., 2008). In clinical practice and controlled trials involving patients with mitochondrial cytopathies, long-term administration of DCA has been associated with improvements in biochemical markers, notably reduced lactate accumulation, alongside evidence of metabolic stabilization (Abdelmalak et al., 2013; Stacpoole et al., 2008). Although no registered clinical trials have specifically evaluated DCA in Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) according to searches on ClinicalTrials.gov, its longstanding use in related mitochondrial diseases—including other neurodegenerative conditions with mitochondrial impairment—supports its translational potential (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, DCA has been explored in cancer research as a means to reverse metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells (Kankotia & Stacpoole, 2014), further corroborating its ability to modulate mitochondrial function and suggesting biological plausibility for repurposing in FRDA, which is also characterized by defective mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, DCA’s mechanism of action is well defined. The primary target of DCA is pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), a family of enzymes (PDK1–PDK4) that normally phosphorylate and inhibit the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. Under conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction or metabolic stress, PDK activity is upregulated, leading to decreased flux through PDH and a shift toward anaerobic glycolysis, which results in lactate accumulation and reduced cellular energy production (Michelakis et al., 2008; Stacpoole et al., 2008). By specifically binding to and inhibiting PDK, DCA relieves this inhibitory phosphorylation of the E1α subunit of PDH, thereby reactivating the enzyme complex (Stacpoole et al., 2008). This reactivation facilitates the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, enhancing entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and promoting efficient mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (Stacpoole et al., 2008).

Further, research indicates that DCA may have secondary effects on mitochondrial metabolism. For example, it can influence the expression of enzymes involved in glycolysis and the TCA cycle, and it affects cellular redox status by reducing lactate levels and thereby diminishing subsequent acidification and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Michelakis et al., 2008; Liou, 2011). Notably, while DCA’s inhibition of PDK leads to increased PDH activity, its metabolism is tightly linked to glutathione transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1), and genetic variabilities in this enzyme can influence DCA’s pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile, particularly with respect to peripheral neuropathy (Abdelmalak et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2023). This molecular cascade is central to the therapeutic hypothesis in FRDA, where frataxin deficiency disrupts iron–sulfur cluster formation and impairs mitochondrial energy production—making the modulation of PDH activity via PDK inhibition a plausible intervention to restore metabolic balance (Stacpoole et al., 2008).

Expected Effect:
Based on the mechanistic profile of DCA, the expected effect in the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia involves a metabolic shift in FRDA patient-derived neurons from glycolysis toward increased oxidative phosphorylation. In FRDA, neuronal cells exhibit compromised mitochondrial function and impaired PDH flux, contributing to energy deficits that underpin neurodegeneration. By inhibiting PDK, DCA is anticipated to reactivate PDH, thereby increasing the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and promoting its oxidation in the TCA cycle. This metabolic rerouting should result in elevated oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and increased ATP production, ultimately enhancing cellular bioenergetics in affected neurons (Zhang et al., 2023).

Experimental assays in FRDA cell models are expected to show biochemical markers consistent with restored PDH activity—such as decreased lactate levels and increased activity of mitochondrial enzymes like citrate synthase—as well as improved mitochondrial morphology and function (Stacpoole et al., 2008; Liou, 2011). In addition, in vitro studies of DCA in various cell types, including neuronal and glial models, have shown that enhanced PDH activity correlates with improved cellular survival under conditions of metabolic stress (Hong et al., 2018). Therefore, the current hypothesis predicts that treatment with DCA will correct the underlying bioenergetic deficiencies observed in FRDA patient-derived neuronal cultures, leading to measurable increases in OCR, ATP production, and overall improvements in mitochondrial function.

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of DCA as a therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia is encouraging based on its well-established mechanism of action and extensive clinical experience in related mitochondrial disorders. Among the primary strengths of DCA are its:

1. Mechanistic Rationale: The compound directly targets a central metabolic checkpoint—PDK inhibition—that governs the flux of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. Given that FRDA is characterized by impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, reactivation of PDH represents a targeted intervention aimed at correcting energy deficits in frataxin-deficient neurons (Stacpoole et al., 2008; Michelakis et al., 2008).

2. Extensive Preclinical and Clinical Data: DCA has a proven track record in enhancing mitochondrial metabolism in disorders such as congenital lactic acidosis and PDH deficiency. Although direct clinical data for FRDA are lacking, the extensive use of DCA in mitochondrial disorders provides strong supportive evidence for its safety and metabolic efficacy, particularly in younger populations (Abdelmalak et al., 2013; Stacpoole et al., 2008).

3. Pharmacological Advantages: High oral bioavailability and the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier are significant advantages for a therapeutic intended to target central nervous system neurons, making DCA a viable candidate for overcoming the delivery challenges inherent to neurological disorders (Michelakis et al., 2008).

4. Potential Synergy with Combination Therapies: Preclinical studies have indicated that DCA may function synergistically when combined with agents such as thiamine, which further optimize PDH complex activity. Combination regimens could potentially mitigate the dose-dependent adverse effects associated with DCA, particularly peripheral neuropathy (Abdelmalak et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2023).

Nonetheless, several weaknesses and concerns must be addressed:

1. Toxicity Issues: Chronic DCA administration has been associated with dose-dependent peripheral neuropathy in both animal models and human trials, a risk that may be exacerbated in older patients due to differential drug metabolism via GSTZ1. These adverse effects underscore the need for careful dosing strategies and possibly individualized regimen adjustments based on pharmacogenetic profiling (Liou, 2011; Stacpoole et al., 2008).

2. Variability in Metabolism: Inter-individual differences in GSTZ1 expression and function can markedly influence DCA clearance and plasma half-life, potentially leading to heterogeneous therapeutic outcomes. This variability may also necessitate the development of precision dosing regimens or advanced delivery systems to ensure consistent therapeutic exposure (Zhang et al., 2023; Abdelmalak et al., 2013).

3. Lack of Direct Data in FRDA: Although the biochemical rationale for DCA use in FRDA is robust, there remains a paucity of direct experimental data from FRDA-specific cellular or animal models. Rigorous preclinical studies are required to validate the hypothesized improvements in OCR, ATP production, and mitochondrial function in FRDA neurons before clinical translation can be considered (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Stacpoole et al., 2008).

4. Potential for Oxidative Stress: While enhancing oxidative phosphorylation is desirable, it may also lead to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The balance between improved energy production and the risk of exacerbating oxidative stress will need to be carefully managed, particularly in the context of FRDA, where oxidative damage is already a concern (Zhang et al., 2023; Liou, 2011).

Overall, DCA presents as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia, given its established ability to modulate mitochondrial metabolism through PDK inhibition and its extensive use in related metabolic disorders. The strengths of its robust mechanism of action, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and deep clinical experience in analogous conditions provide a compelling rationale for further exploration in FRDA. However, addressing its toxicity profile and variability in drug metabolism will be critical in optimizing its therapeutic window for FRDA. In summary, while challenges remain—particularly with respect to neuropathic side effects and the need for direct FRDA-related data—the molecular and clinical evidence supports the continued preclinical assessment and eventual clinical trial evaluation of DCA as a promising therapeutic strategy to restore mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in FRDA patient-derived neurons (Stacpoole et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2023; Kankotia & Stacpoole, 2014).
