Proposal for SS-31 (Elamipretide; Stealth BioTherapeutics)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SS-31, also known as Elamipretide or MTP-131, is a synthetic, cell-permeable tetrapeptide originally developed by Stealth BioTherapeutics. It was discovered through research efforts aimed at restoring mitochondrial bioenergetics by targeting cardiolipin—a unique phospholipid found exclusively in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) that is vital for maintaining cristae integrity and electron transport chain (ETC) organization (Szeto, 2014). SS-31 belongs to the class of Szeto-Schiller peptides, characterized by an alternating aromatic and cationic amino acid motif (D-Arg–dimethyl-Tyr–Lys–Phe-NH2) that facilitates its efficient membrane penetration and selective mitochondrial targeting (Karaa et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2019). This peptide’s design exploits the unique electrostatic interplay with cardiolipin, allowing it to insert into the mitochondrial membrane independent of the membrane potential, thereby distinguishing it from other mitochondria‐targeted molecules that typically require active transport mechanisms (Mitchell et al., 2021). Historically, peptide‐based mitochondrial therapeutics have been explored for their antioxidant capacities and ability to stabilize mitochondrial membranes, a strategy that addresses the bioenergetics failure seen in various aging-related and mitochondrial disorders (Szeto & Birk, 2014).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of SS-31 spans preclinical models to multiple human clinical trials addressing mitochondrial dysfunction. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that SS-31 can improve mitochondrial ATP production, reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reverse mitochondrial depolarization under stress conditions (Birk et al., 2014; Mitchell et al., 2019). Clinically, SS-31 has been investigated in conditions such as primary mitochondrial myopathy (PMM) and heart failure, where its capacity to enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics has been validated in randomized, dose-escalation trials (Karaa et al., 2018; Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2016). Additionally, clinical evaluation in Barth Syndrome, a genetic mitochondrial disorder with cardiomyopathy as a hallmark, has provided further evidence of SS-31’s mitochondrial protective effects (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2017). Importantly, an investigator-initiated study conducted at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia specifically evaluated the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of SS-31 in Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA)—a neurodegenerative disorder marked by mitochondrial dysfunction due to frataxin deficiency—supporting the rationale for its repurposing in FRDA (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 2022). In the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, although direct clinical efficacy data appear limited, the compound’s mechanistic promise, supported by its safety and pharmacokinetic profile from prior trials, forms a compelling basis for further investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Mechanism of Action:
SS-31’s mechanism of action is rooted in its robust interaction with cardiolipin on the IMM. Cardiolipin is essential for forming and maintaining the structural integrity of the mitochondrial cristae and for optimizing the assembly of respiratory supercomplexes that include ETC complexes I–IV (Szeto, 2014; Mitchell et al., 2022). By reversibly binding to cardiolipin, SS-31 stabilizes the cytochrome c/cardiolipin complex, thereby preventing the peroxidation of cardiolipin and reducing the propensity of cytochrome c to acquire peroxidase activity—a key step in triggering apoptosis (Szeto & Birk, 2014; Mitchell et al., 2019). This stabilization results in improved electron transfer efficiency among ETC complexes, leading to enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, increased ATP synthesis, and ultimately a better coupling of oxygen consumption (Chatfield et al., 2019). Moreover, SS-31 reduces the leakage of electrons that typically form ROS, which not only preserves mitochondrial function but also minimizes oxidative stress—a major pathological driver in FRDA (Edzeamey et al., 2024; Mitchell et al., 2021). Biophysical investigations indicate that SS-31 modulates mitochondrial membrane surface electrostatics and lipid organization, thereby enhancing mitochondrial plasticity and resilience under metabolic stress (Mitchell et al., 2021; Tamucci et al., 2023). Its peptide structure and physicochemical properties, including its amphipathic nature and net positive charge, allow for rapid tissue uptake and mitochondrial localization, which is critical because it can act directly at the site of bioenergetic deficiency in FRDA patient-derived cells (Pepe, 2019).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for using SS-31 in Friedreich’s Ataxia is that the peptide will bind to cardiolipin in the defective mitochondria of FRDA patients, thereby stabilizing cristae architecture and enhancing the formation of electron transport chain supercomplexes. In FRDA, there is a well-documented impairment in mitochondrial function primarily due to frataxin deficiency, which disrupts iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, leading to aberrant electron transfer and excessive ROS production (Edzeamey et al., 2024; Lew et al., 2022). By restoring the structural integrity of the IMM, SS-31 is expected to promote optimal docking and assembly of ETC complexes (I–IV), resulting in improved maximal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and ATP output in affected cells (Chatfield et al., 2019; Mitchell et al., 2021). Support for this expectation comes from studies in animal models of mitochondrial dysfunction, including those examining conditions akin to FRDA, in which treatment with SS-31 led to improvements in mitochondrial respiration and decreased oxidative damage (Mitchell et al., 2019; Lew et al., 2022). Given that FRDA patient-derived cardiomyocytes express the critical components of the ETC and cardiolipin, the restoration of these parameters by SS-31 should translate into measurable functional improvements such as enhanced contractility and reduced cellular stress (Chatfield et al., 2019; Scott et al., 2024). Furthermore, the phase 1/2 clinical safety and pharmacokinetic data gathered from previous trials underscore the feasibility of repurposing SS-31 with appropriate dosing regimens in FRDA patients (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov).

Overall Evaluation:
SS-31 represents a promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on its well-established ability to target and stabilize mitochondrial membranes via binding to cardiolipin, thereby enhancing the function of the electron transport chain. Its synthetic peptide nature, derived from the Szeto-Schiller class of compounds, affords high specificity for the IMM and enables restoration of mitochondrial bioenergetics, which is the central defect in FRDA (Szeto, 2014; Mitchell et al., 2019). One of the major strengths of SS-31 is its demonstrated efficacy in improving mitochondrial respiration, reducing ROS production, and stabilizing membrane architecture in various preclinical and clinical models, including trials in mitochondrial myopathy and heart failure (Karaa et al., 2018; Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2017). Furthermore, its previous use in FRDA-relevant contexts, evidenced by the FRDA Investigator Initiated Study at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, supports the concept that mitochondrial bioenergetic deficits in FRDA may be mitigated by SS-31 (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 2022).

From a biophysical perspective, the ability of SS-31 to engage directly with cardiolipin and modulate the mitochondrial membrane environment is particularly compelling for FRDA, where disrupted iron-sulfur cluster assembly and mitochondrial structural abnormalities are early and crucial features of the disease (Mitchell et al., 2021; Edzeamey et al., 2024). This mechanism not only stabilizes the mitochondria but may also promote the assembly of ETC supercomplexes, thereby increasing maximal oxygen consumption and ATP generation, which are critically compromised in FRDA (Chatfield et al., 2019; Lew et al., 2022).

However, there are also limitations and uncertainties. The direct clinical efficacy of SS-31 in FRDA remains to be conclusively demonstrated since most existing clinical data on SS-31 pertain to other mitochondrial diseases and conditions such as PMM, Barth Syndrome, and heart failure (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2016; Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2017). The pharmacodynamic and long-term effects specifically in the context of FRDA pathology still need further exploration. Additionally, while FRDA pathophysiology shares core mitochondrial features with other disorders, the chronic progression and neurodegenerative aspects of FRDA may present unique hurdles that require optimization of dosing and possibly combination therapies to achieve meaningful clinical benefits (Manto, 2022; Scott et al., 2024). Furthermore, the limited blood-brain barrier penetration of SS-31 may restrict its efficacy in preventing or reversing neurological deficits in FRDA, where central nervous system involvement is significant (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 2022; Ji et al., 2021).

In summary, SS-31 shows considerable promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on its robust mitochondrial-targeted mechanism, strong preclinical data on improving mitochondrial bioenergetics, and an established safety record in early clinical trials. Its capacity to bind cardiolipin, stabilize mitochondrial cristae, and promote ETC supercomplex formation directly addresses the hypothesized therapeutic mechanism in FRDA. Despite the need for further dedicated studies in FRDA models and patient populations to validate its efficacy in this specific context, the existing biochemical, preclinical, and clinical evidence provides a solid rationale for advancing SS-31 into more focused FRDA clinical development (ClinicalTrials.gov; Mitchell et al., 2019; Chatfield et al., 2019).

Overall, the strengths of SS-31 include its innovative mitochondrial-targeted design, proven effect on restoring mitochondrial bioenergetics, and supportive safety/PK data from previous human trials. The potential weaknesses include the need to optimize CNS exposure in FRDA patients and the current paucity of direct clinical efficacy data in FRDA, which must be addressed in subsequent phase 2/3 trials. Given these considerations, the repurposing of SS-31 for Friedreich’s Ataxia is scientifically compelling and warrants further preclinical validation and clinical evaluation to determine its full therapeutic potential.
