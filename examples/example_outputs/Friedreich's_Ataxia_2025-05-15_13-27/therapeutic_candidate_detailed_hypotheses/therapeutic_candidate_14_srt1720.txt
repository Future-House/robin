Proposal for SRT1720

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of SRT1720 as a candidate therapeutic for Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA):

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SRT1720 is a fully synthetic small‐molecule activator of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) that was originally discovered through high‐throughput screening programs aimed at finding compounds that could overcome the limitations of natural SIRT1 activators such as resveratrol. It belongs to the class of imidazo[1,2-b]thiazole compounds and was developed following extensive medicinal chemistry efforts to improve potency, specificity, and pharmacokinetic properties relative to polyphenolic natural products. The molecule’s design was predicated on modifying the structural features of resveratrol in order to preserve the “calorie restriction–mimetic” biological effects – notably those attributable to SIRT1 activation – while circumventing problems such as low solubility, poor bioavailability, and nonspecific binding. In this context, SRT1720 represents a next‐generation synthetic SIRT1 activator designed to engage SIRT1 via an allosteric mechanism that lowers the Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) for substrate(s) and expedites deacetylase activity. Its chemical synthesis and structure–activity relationship examinations have been described in several studies, where variations of the imidazo[1,2-b]thiazole scaffold were explored to optimize the potency and selectivity of SIRT1 activation (Granchi & Minutolo, 2018; Höppner et al., 2014). As such, SRT1720 is classified among sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs) that are structurally distinct from natural polyphenols and have been investigated for their capacity to modulate metabolic pathways, inflammatory responses, and mitochondrial function.

Therapeutic History:
SRT1720 and related compounds have primarily been studied for their beneficial effects in preclinical models of metabolic dysfunction including type 2 diabetes mellitus, diet-induced obesity, and cardiovascular pathology. Preclinical studies in rodents have demonstrated that SRT1720 administration improves insulin sensitivity, enhances glucose homeostasis, reduces inflammatory markers, and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis by activating SIRT1 (Sauve, 2009; Andreux et al., 2013). In animal models, oral dosing of SRT1720 led to improvements in metabolic parameters, reduced fat accumulation, and protected various tissues – including liver and kidney – from ischemic and oxidative injuries (Funk, 2012). The compound even extended lifespan in obese mice by mimicking the beneficial effects associated with calorie restriction. Importantly, despite these encouraging preclinical outcomes, there is no direct evidence that SRT1720 has been tested either in clinical trials or in preclinical models specifically for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Searches using key databases (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov) have yielded no records of clinical trials investigating SRT1720 or related SIRT1 activators in FRDA (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In contrast, other compounds targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress – such as pioglitazone or Nrf2 activators – have been the subject of repurposing studies in FRDA (Clay et al., 2019; Rufini et al., 2022). Thus, while SRT1720’s therapeutic history in metabolic and cardiovascular indications is well documented in the preclinical literature, its use in neurodegenerative conditions marked by frataxin deficiency and mitochondrial impairment remains to be established.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, SRT1720 acts as an allosteric activator of SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase enzyme that plays a critical role in multiple cellular processes including energy metabolism, inflammation, DNA repair, and mitochondrial biogenesis. SIRT1’s enzymatic activity is normally limited by substrate availability and by the levels of NAD+ in the cell; SRT1720 binds to the enzyme-substrate complex and lowers the Km for its peptide substrates, thereby enhancing deacetylase activity (Sinclair & Hubbard, 2013; Sauve, 2009). One of the key downstream targets of SIRT1 is the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). Under normal conditions, PGC-1α is acetylated and held in an inactive state; upon deacetylation by SIRT1, PGC-1α becomes activated, translocates to the nucleus, and upregulates the transcription of a broad network of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. This includes the stimulation of nuclear respiratory factors (NRF-1 and NRF-2) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA), which drive the replication of mitochondrial DNA and the expression of mitochondrial proteins (Andreux et al., 2013; Funk, 2012). Furthermore, SRT1720 has been demonstrated in preclinical models to not only improve mitochondrial respiratory flux but also to increase ATP production, likely by boosting the overall mitochondrial capacity of cells affected by metabolic stress (Funk, 2012). In addition to directly impacting mitochondrial biogenesis, SRT1720 can modulate inflammation by deacetylating p65 – a subunit of NF-κB – thereby suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (Granchi & Minutolo, 2018; Gueguen et al., 2014). Although some studies have questioned whether the activation of SIRT1 in vitro might be substrate-dependent (especially when fluorophore-tagged peptide substrates are used), multiple independent lines of evidence from in vivo rodent studies support the conclusion that SRT1720 does indeed enhance SIRT1 activity, leading to improvements in mitochondrial dynamics and metabolic function (Sauve, 2009; Sinclair & Hubbard, 2013).

Expected Effect in FRDA:
The central hypothesis for repurposing SRT1720 in Friedreich’s Ataxia hinges on its ability to reverse the downregulation of SIRT1 that has been observed in FRDA patient fibroblasts, and thereby rescue downstream pathways mediated by PGC-1α. In FRDA, frataxin deficiency leads to impaired mitochondrial function, accumulation of oxidative stress, and reduced ATP production. Several studies in FRDA models have documented decreased PGC-1α expression and a consequent failure to mount an adequate mitochondrial biogenesis response in the face of cellular stress (Marmolino et al., 2010; Clay et al., 2019). By pharmacologically activating SIRT1, SRT1720 is expected to promote deacetylation of PGC-1α, thereby facilitating its activation and nuclear translocation. Once activated, PGC-1α would drive the transcription of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial replication and oxidative phosphorylation, leading to an increase in mitochondrial number, enhanced respiratory flux, and higher ATP yields. In cell-based assays performed in vitro – such as those using FRDA patient fibroblasts – one could measure a decrease in PGC-1α acetylation levels concomitant with an increase in the expression of mitochondrial markers including components of the respiratory complexes and mtDNA copy number (Funk, 2012; Manjula et al., 2021). This improved mitochondrial function should theoretically translate into enhanced cellular bioenergetics and a reduction in oxidative damage, which are central to the pathology of FRDA. Because mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of FRDA, augmenting mitochondrial biogenesis via the SIRT1–PGC-1α axis is a plausible strategy to restore energy homeostasis in affected cells (Andreux et al., 2013; Sanchis-Gomar et al., 2014). Furthermore, since SRT1720 has demonstrated the capacity to be administered orally with acceptable pharmacokinetic profiles in rodent models, and given its prior safety profile in these preclinical investigations (Granchi & Minutolo, 2018; Sauve, 2009), there is a strong rationale for its evaluation in FRDA cell systems as a means of improving mitochondrial respiratory function and ATP production.

Overall Evaluation:
Based on the comprehensive review of the literature, SRT1720 appears to be a scientifically promising candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia, especially given the central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the disease’s etiology. The strengths of SRT1720 as a therapeutic candidate include its potent and relatively selective activation of SIRT1; its well-documented ability in multiple preclinical models to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, respiratory function, and ATP synthesis; and its oral bioavailability with favorable pharmacokinetic parameters established in rodent studies (Sauve, 2009; Andreux et al., 2013). These characteristics reinforce the hypothesis that by reversing the SIRT1 deficiency observed in FRDA cells, SRT1720 could reactivate the PGC-1α signaling pathway, thereby stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis and ultimately improving the cellular energy balance in patients with FRDA.

Nonetheless, several challenges remain that temper this enthusiasm. First, while SRT1720’s metabolic benefits have been well established in models of diabetes and obesity, there is a noticeable lack of data directly addressing its efficacy in models of neurodegeneration or in the specific context of FRDA. No preclinical studies to date have directly evaluated SRT1720’s effects on frataxin expression or mitochondrial function in FRDA patient-derived cells or animal models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Second, some controversy persists regarding the assay methodologies used to demonstrate SIRT1 activation by SRT1720, with some reports suggesting that the compound’s effects may be dependent on the presence of fluorophore-tagged substrates in vitro, which could limit the translational significance of such data (Sinclair & Hubbard, 2013; Sauve, 2009). Third, the off-target effects and potential adverse reactions associated with first-generation SIRT1 activators like SRT1720 need to be carefully assessed before moving forward with clinical studies, especially given the complex pathophysiology of FRDA that involves both central and peripheral mitochondrial defects (Granchi & Minutolo, 2018; Chang et al., 2024). Lastly, while its oral pharmacokinetics in rodents are encouraging, reliable data on its pharmacokinetic profile in humans are absent, which could present hurdles in the drug development pipeline.

In conclusion, SRT1720 exhibits several mechanistic attributes that are in line with the therapeutic needs of Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its ability to activate SIRT1 and, consequently, stimulate the deacetylation and activation of PGC-1α provides a direct rationale for its use to restore mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism in FRDA cells. This approach directly tackles the mitochondrial dysfunction and energy deficit observed in FRDA – a disease marked by frataxin deficiency and resultant impaired mitochondrial function. Thus, while further preclinical studies specifically designed to evaluate SRT1720 in FRDA models are warranted, the existing body of literature in related metabolic and mitochondrial paradigms supports its potential utility. The strengths of SRT1720 lie in its potent activation of SIRT1, its documented capacity to enhance mitochondrial function, and its oral bioavailability in preclinical models; however, careful consideration must be given to assay-dependent activation mechanisms and potential off-target effects. Overall, SRT1720 represents a promising candidate for further investigation in the therapeutic landscape of Friedreich’s Ataxia, provided that subsequent studies reaffirm its efficacy in disease-specific models and elucidate its safety profile in a clinical context (Manjula et al., 2021; Andreux et al., 2013).
