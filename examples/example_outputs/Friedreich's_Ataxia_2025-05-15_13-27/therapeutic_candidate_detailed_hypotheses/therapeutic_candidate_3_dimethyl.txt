Proposal for Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), commercially known as Tecfidera, is a methyl ester of fumaric acid derived by chemical modification of fumaric acid into a more lipophilic compound that enhances its oral bioavailability. As a synthetic derivative belonging to the fumaric acid ester class, DMF was originally developed and approved for use in multiple sclerosis and psoriasis due to its potent anti‐inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. In terms of its chemical origin, DMF is produced via esterification reactions that convert fumaric acid into a dimethyl ester, endowing the molecule with the necessary properties to cross the blood–brain barrier and interact with intracellular targets. This class of compounds is recognized for their ability to modulate redox homeostasis in cells mostly through activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Because of its capacity to activate Nrf2 and modulate other signaling cascades such as the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, DMF has been repurposed as a potential therapeutic candidate in diseases characterized by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, including Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) (Abeti et al., 2022; Bresciani et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Dimethyl fumarate has an established history in clinical medicine as a treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis, with decades of clinical use supporting a robust safety profile and clear pharmacokinetic properties. Its approval by the FDA for multiple sclerosis underscores its validated clinical efficacy in modulating inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways, despite being primarily indicated for immunomodulation. In preclinical studies using cellular and animal models, DMF has been shown to increase the expression of frataxin—a protein deficient in Friedreich’s Ataxia—and enhance mitochondrial gene expression and function. For instance, studies in FA patient-derived fibroblasts and lymphoblasts have demonstrated significant dose-dependent increases in frataxin mRNA and protein expression upon treatment with DMF (Jasoliya et al., 2019). Furthermore, oral dosing of DMF in FRDA mouse models rescued mitochondrial dysfunction, increased aconitase activity, and led to improvements in biochemical markers of mitochondrial health (Hui et al., 2020). Although DMF has not yet been assessed in official clinical trials for Friedreich’s Ataxia, its repurposing for FRDA is strongly supported by preclinical evidence as well as by its extensive use in other neurodegenerative contexts, where its mechanism of action aligns with the pathophysiology seen in FRDA (Pane et al., 2023; Rufini et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
DMF’s primary mode of action involves the activation of the Nrf2 pathway—a master regulator of cellular antioxidant responses. Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its inhibitory partner Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which targets Nrf2 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. DMF acts as a reactive electrophile that covalently modifies cysteine residues on Keap1. This covalent modification disrupts the Keap1–Nrf2 complex, thereby preventing Nrf2 degradation, and permits Nrf2 to translocate into the nucleus where it binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in DNA. This binding initiates the transcription of a wide range of cytoprotective and antioxidant genes, including those involved in detoxification, glutathione synthesis, and mitochondrial protection (Abeti et al., 2022; Strawser et al., 2017). Additionally, DMF indirectly activates the AMPK pathway, a central energy sensor in the cell that, when activated, phosphorylates and induces the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). PGC-1α is a key transcriptional coactivator that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Thus, by stimulating AMPK signaling, DMF may promote the upregulation of PGC-1α expression, leading to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and improved bioenergetics in cells afflicted by mitochondrial dysfunction, such as FRDA neurons (Jasoliya et al., 2019; Pane et al., 2023; Rufini et al., 2022). This multifaceted mechanism—combining antioxidant gene induction with potential enhancements in mitochondrial biogenesis—addresses both the oxidative stress and the bioenergetic deficits that are central to FRDA pathogenesis.

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis under evaluation, it is anticipated that DMF will ameliorate the bioenergetic deficits in FRDA by executing two interrelated actions: first, through robust activation of the Nrf2 pathway which will lead to the increased transcription of antioxidant genes, thereby reducing cellular oxidative stress; and second, by indirectly stimulating the AMPK pathway which will, in turn, enhance the activity of PGC-1α, resulting in increased mitochondrial biogenesis. In vitro studies in FRDA models have already shown that DMF leads to upregulation of frataxin levels, an increase in mitochondrial gene expression and function, and a corresponding reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (Abeti et al., 2022; Hui et al., 2020). These effects are expected to be measurable in assays that quantify mitochondrial DNA copy number, enzymatic activities such as that of aconitase (a marker of iron–sulfur cluster integrity), and overall improvements in cellular ATP production. The expression of Nrf2 and its downstream targets has been documented in neuronal and fibroblast cell lines, which are commonly used models in FRDA studies (Jasoliya et al., 2019; Pane et al., 2023). In addition, given that AMPK activation is well established to improve cellular energy metabolism and promote mitochondrial renewal, treatment with DMF should lead to heightened ATP production and enhanced metabolic resilience in neurons that are typically vulnerable to mitochondrial deficits in FRDA (Rufini et al., 2022; Strawser et al., 2017). Collectively, these expected effects are mechanistically consonant with DMF’s known pharmacological properties and align with the corrective actions needed to counteract the oxidative stress and bioenergetic impairment that are hallmarks of FRDA.

Overall Evaluation:
The potential repurposing of DMF for the treatment of Friedreich’s Ataxia is supported by a robust mechanistic rationale and a body of preclinical data that highlights its ability to improve mitochondrial function and augment antioxidant defenses. One of the most significant strengths of DMF lies in its established safety profile and clinical track record in its current indications, such as multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. This confers a degree of assurance regarding its tolerability and pharmacokinetics, which is further supported by the fact that the effective human-equivalent doses for mitochondrial effects in animal models are within the clinically used dose ranges (Hui et al., 2020; Jasoliya et al., 2019). Moreover, the dual action of DMF on both the Nrf2 and AMPK pathways addresses key aspects of FRDA pathophysiology: by activating Nrf2, DMF is well positioned to counteract the heightened oxidative stress featured in FRDA, while the potential upregulation of PGC-1α via AMPK activation contributes to restoring mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism (Abeti et al., 2022; Pane et al., 2023).

Nonetheless, there remain certain weaknesses and gaps in the current data regarding DMF’s applicability to FRDA. One notable limitation is that, to date, there are no registered clinical trials specifically evaluating DMF in FRDA patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The majority of the evidence supporting DMF’s potential for FRDA comes from preclinical studies in cell and animal models. While these models have demonstrated promising increases in frataxin expression and improvements in mitochondrial function, the translation of these effects into meaningful clinical outcomes in FRDA patients remains to be clearly established (Jasoliya et al., 2019; Hui et al., 2020). There is also the challenge inherent in repurposing a drug designed for an immunomodulatory purpose; the pleiotropic effects of DMF that confer its neuroprotective properties might also, under certain conditions, lead to off-target effects that must be carefully monitored. Furthermore, while the activation of AMPK and consequent upregulation of PGC-1α is inferred from DMF’s known mechanisms in other contexts, direct evidence linking DMF with robust increases in mitochondrial biogenesis via these pathways in FRDA models is still emerging (Rufini et al., 2022; Strawser et al., 2017).

Despite these concerns, the overall scientific rationale for repurposing DMF is compelling. The convergence of oxidative stress, impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics, and reduced frataxin expression in FRDA creates a therapeutic window that DMF could exploit through its modulation of the Nrf2–Keap1 axis and related bioenergetic pathways. The biochemical and molecular data indicate that DMF’s actions in restoring redox balance and enhancing mitochondrial function could ameliorate the neurodegenerative process that underpins FRDA (Abeti et al., 2022; Bresciani et al., 2023). Additionally, its established oral availability makes DMF an attractive candidate in terms of patient compliance and ease of administration, which are critical components in chronic disorders like FRDA.

In conclusion, while direct clinical evidence of DMF’s efficacy in Friedreich’s Ataxia remains to be generated, the extensive preclinical data, along with its well-defined mechanism of action and favorable safety profile, provide strong support for further investigation. The hypothesis that DMF will activate Nrf2 and AMPK pathways in FRDA neurons—thereby enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, increasing PGC-1α expression, and ameliorating bioenergetic deficits—is well grounded in current molecular research (Jasoliya et al., 2019; Pane et al., 2023; Strawser et al., 2017). Given these strengths and the potential impact on mitochondrial function in FRDA, it would be worthwhile for the development team to pursue additional preclinical studies and eventually design early-phase clinical trials to rigorously test DMF’s therapeutic benefit in FRDA patients. The overall assessment of DMF as a repurposed agent for Friedreich’s Ataxia is therefore cautiously optimistic, with the recommendation to prioritize further investigation while closely monitoring any immunomodulatory or off-target effects that could arise from its pleiotropic mechanisms (Rufini et al., 2022; Tiberi et al., 2023).
