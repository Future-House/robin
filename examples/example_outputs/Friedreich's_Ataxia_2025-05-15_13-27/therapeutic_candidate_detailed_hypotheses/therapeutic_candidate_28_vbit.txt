Proposal for VBIT-4

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of VBIT-4 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA):

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
VBIT-4 is a synthetically derived small‐molecule inhibitor originally developed from a lead compound, AKOS-022, which was identified through a high-throughput screening campaign employing bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET2) assays (Ben-Hail et al., 2016). Subsequent structure–activity relationship studies led to the synthesis of several derivatives, including VBIT-3 and notably VBIT-4. VBIT-4 belongs to a novel chemical class of VDAC1 (voltage-dependent anion channel 1) inhibitors that modulate mitochondrial permeability by preventing the oligomerization of VDAC1—a process implicated in the release of pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c (Ben-Hail et al., 2016). This class of compounds has been designed to stabilize mitochondrial function by ensuring VDAC1 remains in a monomeric or non-pathological oligomer state. In several preclinical studies, molecules like VBIT-4 have been used experimentally to interfere with mitochondrial signaling pathways that normally lead to apoptosis, proving useful in models of cancer, neurodegeneration, and even diabetic complications (Ben-Hail et al., 2016; Belosludtsev et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Biochemical studies have demonstrated that VBIT-4 directly binds to purified VDAC1, thereby diminishing channel conductance and reducing its oligomerization in response to apoptotic stimuli (Ben-Hail et al., 2016). Preclinical experiments have shown that VBIT-4 can inhibit cytochrome c release from mitochondria, preserve mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and prevent the detachment of hexokinase from mitochondria, a process intricately linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis (Ben-Hail et al., 2016). While these studies have been primarily conducted in cellular models exposed to stresses like selenite, staurosporine, and cisplatin, they have not yet been specifically extended to FRDA models. Moreover, searching clinical trial databases reveals no registered studies testing VBIT-4 or other VDAC1 inhibitors in Friedreich’s Ataxia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Thus, while VBIT-4 has shown promise in models of mitochondrial-driven apoptosis in conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes-related mitochondrial damage (Verma et al., 2022; Belosludtsev et al., 2023), its use in FRDA remains hypothetical yet highly plausible given the shared mechanistic features of mitochondrial dysfunction.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, VBIT-4 acts by directly binding to VDAC1, a protein embedded in the mitochondrial outer membrane that regulates the flux of ions, metabolites, and ATP/ADP exchange, in addition to playing a critical role in the initiation of apoptosis (Ben-Hail et al., 2016). Under pathological conditions, VDAC1 tends to form oligomers which create pores that permit cytochrome c and other apoptogenic factors to leak into the cytosol, thereby triggering caspase activation and cell death (Ben-Hail et al., 2016). VBIT-4 inhibits this oligomerization process, presumably by stabilizing VDAC1 in a conformation that is less prone to interacting with itself and with other mitochondrial proteins. As a result, it not only reduces the release of cytochrome c but also preserves the mitochondrial membrane potential, limits excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and maintains intracellular calcium homeostasis (Ben-Hail et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2023). This mechanism is supported by observations that VBIT-4 is capable of restoring ΔΨm and oxygen consumption rates (OCR) in cell models undergoing mitochondrial stress (Ben-Hail et al., 2016). Importantly, VDAC1 is expressed in all mitochondria-rich tissues, including those affected in FRDA, where mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark, rendering this target both accessible and therapeutically relevant (Shoshan-Barmatz et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
Based on its known mechanism, VBIT-4 is expected to prevent pathological VDAC1 oligomerization in FRDA mitochondria. By doing so, it should reduce the inappropriate release of cytochrome c—a critical early event in apoptosis—stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential, and consequently support efficient electron transport chain (ETC) function. Since FRDA is characterized by mitochondrial iron accumulation, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and heightened ROS-driven damage, the stabilization of mitochondrial membranes by VBIT-4 would ideally lead to improved ATP production and reduced oxidative stress (Edzeamey et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2023). This expected effect aligns with findings from other disease models where VBIT-4 has restored mitochondrial function and decreased apoptosis by preventing key pathological events such as calcium overload and ROS generation (Ben-Hail et al., 2016; Belosludtsev et al., 2023). In essence, in an FRDA assay, one would anticipate that treatment with VBIT-4 will yield preserved mitochondrial membrane potential, improved electron transport chain efficiency (OCR), and a decrease in markers of apoptosis such as cytochrome c release. Given that frataxin deficiency in FRDA leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and disturbed calcium homeostasis (Zhao et al., 2023), the application of VBIT-4 could help mitigate these deficits by targeting a central node—VDAC1—that orchestrates multiple facets of mitochondrial integrity.

Overall Evaluation:
VBIT-4 presents several strong attributes as a potential therapeutic agent for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Among its strengths is the clear mechanistic rationale: by preventing VDAC1 oligomerization, VBIT-4 addresses the core mitochondrial dysfunction that underlies apoptotic cell death. Preclinical data in various models (including those for Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes-related mitochondrial dysfunction) support its efficacy in restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, reducing ROS generation, and preserving metabolic activity (Ben-Hail et al., 2016; Verma et al., 2022). Moreover, its favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles in animal studies lend further support to the idea that it might be repurposed safely for FRDA, a disease in which long-term treatment would likely be necessary (Ben-Hail et al., 2016).

However, a significant weakness of the current dataset is the absence of direct preclinical or clinical data concerning VBIT-4 in Friedreich’s Ataxia. While the general role of VDAC1 in mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis is well documented, FRDA-specific studies—such as in FXN-deficient cell models or appropriate animal models—are lacking (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, while VBIT-4 has been well characterized in the context of apoptosis and neurodegeneration, FRDA has its own unique aspects, such as disrupted iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and altered mitochondrial calcium handling, that might require additional mechanistic validation (Zhao et al., 2023). There is also the potential for unforeseen off-target effects, as mitochondrial dynamics are complex and involve the interplay of many proteins beyond VDAC1. Furthermore, while the compound’s synthesis and chemical class have been described in preclinical reports, more detailed information regarding its chemical stability, bioavailability in tissues directly affected in FRDA (e.g., the cerebellum and dorsal root ganglia), and its long-term safety remains to be rigorously established (Ben-Hail et al., 2016).

In summary, VBIT-4 is an innovative small molecule that acts by inhibiting VDAC1 oligomerization—a pivotal event in the cascade of mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Its previously demonstrated ability to restore mitochondrial membrane potential, improve oxidative phosphorylation, and reduce ROS production in other disease models offers a compelling rationale for its application in Friedreich’s Ataxia. Although direct experimental evidence in FRDA models is currently absent, the mechanism by which VBIT-4 operates aligns closely with the pathological defects observed in FRDA, including impaired electron transport chain efficiency and increased oxidative damage. The strengths of VBIT-4 lie in its clear mechanistic action on a well-established mitochondrial target, its proven efficacy in preclinical models of related mitochondrial and neurodegenerative disorders, and its apparent safety profile in long-term administration studies. Its weaknesses include the lack of direct FRDA-related preclinical data and the need for comprehensive studies to map its pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in the specific context of FRDA. Overall, further investigation in FRDA-specific cell and animal models is warranted to validate whether VBIT-4’s mitochondrial protective effects can translate into clinical benefit for patients suffering from Friedreich’s Ataxia (Ben-Hail et al., 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Zhao et al., 2023).
