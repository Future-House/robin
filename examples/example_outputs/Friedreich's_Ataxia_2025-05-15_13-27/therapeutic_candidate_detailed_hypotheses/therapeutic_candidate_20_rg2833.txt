Proposal for RG2833 (HDAC Inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
RG2833, also known as RGFP109, is a synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor belonging to the pimelic diphenylamide class of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. This compound was developed by introducing modifications to the benzamide scaffold in order to target epigenetic dysregulation, with a particular focus on overcoming the transcriptional silencing of the FXN gene that characterizes Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA). The compound was synthesized through medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at optimizing brain penetration and metabolic stability, and it belongs to a class of HDAC inhibitors that have previously been explored mainly within oncology but have more recently been repurposed for neurodegenerative disorders. In preclinical studies, the 2-aminobenzamide class of HDAC inhibitors, including RG2833, has been shown to lead to increased acetylation of histones at key residues in the chromatin region around the FXN gene, thereby alleviating gene silencing (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Soragni et al., 2014).

Therapeutic History:
HDAC inhibitors, as a drug class, have a long history of use in oncology, where their ability to alter chromatin structure and gene expression has been leveraged to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. However, over the last decade multiple studies have repurposed these compounds for neurodegenerative conditions. RG2833 was originally developed based on biochemical evidence gathered from FRDA patient-derived cells and animal models. Preclinical studies demonstrated that treatment with RG2833 results in an increase in both FXN mRNA and frataxin protein levels in fibroblasts and lymphoblasts derived from FRDA patients, as well as in neuronal cells differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Soragni et al., 2014). Similarly, mouse models of FRDA, such as the YG8R transgenic mice, have provided evidence that administration of pimelic diphenylamide HDAC inhibitors, including RG2833 and related compounds like RGFP109, can lead to improved mitochondrial function, as measured by restoration of iron–sulfur cluster enzyme activity and improvements in motor coordination (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Sandi, 2010). Furthermore, early-phase clinical trials have established a tolerability profile for RG2833; the compound has demonstrated target engagement in humans through its ability to increase histone acetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and trends toward increased FXN expression in FRDA patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Strawser et al., 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, RG2833 functions by selectively inhibiting class I HDACs, particularly HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3. The therapeutic rationale for this approach in FRDA is directly linked to the epigenetic pathogenesis of the disease. In FRDA, expanded GAA·TTC triplet repeats in intron 1 of the FXN gene lead to heterochromatin formation and a localized decrease in histone acetylation. This hypoacetylated state is associated with an impaired transcriptional environment that results in reduced FXN mRNA and consequently lower levels of frataxin protein, a critical protein involved in mitochondrial iron–sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly and oxidative phosphorylation (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Sandi, 2010).

RG2833 reverses this gene silencing by binding to the catalytic pockets of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 with a slow-on/slow-off kinetic mechanism. This prolonged inhibition results in increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 near the FXN locus, particularly at sites such as H3K9, H4K5, and H4K12, which are critical for maintaining an open and transcriptionally active chromatin configuration (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Soragni, Chou, Rusche, & Gottesfeld, 2015). The increased histone acetylation relieves the repressive chromatin environment, allowing RNA polymerase II to engage more effectively with the FXN promoter, thereby restoring transcriptional activity. Beyond histone modifications, evidence suggests that treatment with RG2833 also correlates with improvements in downstream mitochondrial parameters, including increased activity of Fe-S cluster–dependent enzymes and improved ATP generation, which critically depend on sufficient frataxin levels (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Strawser et al., 2017). The compound’s selectivity for HDAC3 is particularly significant because HDAC3 has been found to be a major regulator of FXN gene silencing in FRDA patient cells, and selective inhibition of HDAC3 appears to be a key mechanism by which FXN transcription is reactivated (Soragni & Gottesfeld, 2016; Soragni et al., 2015).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underlying the use of RG2833 in FRDA is that by increasing histone acetylation at the FXN gene locus, the compound will de-repress FXN transcription, leading to an upregulation of FXN mRNA and a consequential increase in frataxin protein. In vitro studies have consistently demonstrated that treatment of FRDA patient-derived fibroblasts or lymphoblasts with RG2833 results in a two- to threefold increase in FXN mRNA levels to levels comparable to those seen in asymptomatic heterozygous individuals (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Soragni et al., 2014). This is significant because even a moderate restoration of frataxin levels (approximately 50% of normal) is thought to be potentially therapeutic in FRDA, given that heterozygous carriers do not develop the symptoms of the disease.

Furthermore, the reactivation of FXN transcription is expected to have downstream effects on mitochondrial function. Frataxin is essential for the proper biogenesis of Fe-S clusters – critical components in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes – and its deficiency leads to impaired ATP generation and increased oxidative stress. Therefore, by upregulating FXN expression, RG2833 is hypothesized to improve mitochondrial respiration and overall cellular energy metabolism. This improvement in mitochondrial function may be reflected in enhanced activity of Fe-S cluster enzymes, increased oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and improved ATP production in treated cells (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Strawser et al., 2017). In animal models, these biochemical effects have translated into functional improvements, such as enhanced motor coordination and reduced neurodegenerative pathology. The expectation is that similar improvements in mitochondrial protein function and energy production will occur in FRDA patients, potentially translating to clinical benefits in terms of neurological function and cardiac performance, which are key aspects of FRDA pathology (Zesiewicz et al., 2020; Strawser et al., 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
The accumulated preclinical and early clinical evidence presents RG2833 as a promising therapeutic candidate for FRDA. Its primary strength lies in its rational design and mechanism of action: by selectively inhibiting class I HDACs, especially HDAC3, RG2833 directly targets the epigenetic modifications that lead to FXN gene silencing. The ability of RG2833 to restore histone acetylation and reactivate FXN transcription has been consistently demonstrated in FRDA patient cells and animal models, where the resultant improvements in mitochondrial function have been documented. The safety profile observed in Phase I studies lends further support to its continued development, making it a strong candidate for further clinical trials (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Soragni et al., 2014; Strawser et al., 2017).

Nevertheless, there are some notable challenges and potential weaknesses. One concern is the suboptimal central nervous system (CNS) bioavailability that has been observed with earlier compounds in the class, although RG2833 has demonstrated improved brain penetration relative to its predecessors. Metabolic liabilities also exist, as the drug is known to be metabolized into inactive and potentially toxic benzimidazole metabolites that could present challenges during long-term administration – a significant concern given the chronic nature of FRDA (Soragni et al., 2014; Soragni et al., 2015). Additionally, while early-phase clinical trials have confirmed target engagement and a favorable safety profile, robust clinical efficacy data demonstrating meaningful clinical or functional improvements in FRDA patients remain to be established. This is an important consideration, as the ultimate goal is to improve neurological and cardiac outcomes rather than merely achieving biochemical changes at the molecular level (Soragni & Gottesfeld, 2016; Zesiewicz et al., 2020).

Furthermore, while the mechanism of increasing histone acetylation at the FXN locus is well supported by both preclinical and early clinical evidence, there is inherent complexity in epigenetic regulation that may result in off-target effects or variable patient responses. The epigenetic landscape in FRDA is intricate, and the long-term consequences of HDAC inhibition on the global gene expression profile are not fully known. Although studies have suggested that 2-aminobenzamide HDAC inhibitors tend to have a relatively limited impact on global gene expression – affecting only a few hundred genes with modest fold changes – careful monitoring of potential adverse effects remains critical (Soragni & Gottesfeld, 2016; Strawser et al., 2017).

In summary, the preclinical data have rigorously demonstrated that RG2833 can reverse the epigenetic silencing of the FXN gene by increasing histone acetylation, leading to meaningful increases in FXN mRNA and frataxin protein levels. This biochemical restoration correlates with improved mitochondrial function and suggests downstream benefits that could ameliorate the clinical manifestations of FRDA. Early clinical safety studies further support the feasibility of the compound’s use in humans. However, long-term clinical efficacy, optimal dosing regimens, and mitigation of potential toxic metabolites remain issues to be addressed in future studies. Overall, RG2833 represents a strong candidate for further development as a disease-modifying therapy for FRDA, with the potential to address the root cause of frataxin deficiency through targeted epigenetic modulation (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Soragni et al., 2015; Soragni & Gottesfeld, 2016; Strawser et al., 2017).
