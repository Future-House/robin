Proposal for Elamipretide (SS-31)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Elamipretide (also known as SS-31, MTP-131, or Stealth peptide) is a synthetic aromatic-cationic tetrapeptide designed to target mitochondria. It was originally developed based on the Szeto–Schiller peptides—a class of compounds characterized by an alternating cationic and aromatic amino acid sequence that facilitates cell membrane penetration and preferential accumulation in mitochondria (Mitchell et al., 2022). These peptides are synthesized chemically in the laboratory using standard peptide synthesis techniques, and they are formulated for systemic administration. Elamipretide belongs to a class of mitochondria-targeted therapeutics that have been developed to improve bioenergetics by stabilizing mitochondrial membranes and reducing oxidative stress (Oliver & Reddy, 2019). This class of compounds has previously been used in preclinical and clinical investigations to treat mitochondrial dysfunction across a spectrum of conditions, including primary mitochondrial myopathies and ischemia-reperfusion injury in cardiac tissues (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Jiang et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Elamipretide has undergone extensive preclinical evaluation as a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant and membrane-stabilizing agent. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the peptide can protect mitochondrial cristae structure, preserve electron transport chain (ETC) efficiency, and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in cellular and animal models of mitochondrial dysfunction (Allen et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020). Clinically, elamipretide has been evaluated in Phase 2 trials involving primary mitochondrial myopathy, Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), and other mitochondrial disorders, where it has shown modest improvements in ATP synthetic capacity (ATPmax) and functional outcomes such as exercise tolerance, with a favorable safety profile (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although elamipretide has not yet been approved for Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) specifically, its application in related mitochondrial disorders and cardiomyopathies is encouraging because FRDA is characterized by severe mitochondrial dysfunction including decreased ATP production and increased oxidative stress (Zhao et al., 2017). Preclinical investigations in FRDA cellular models have demonstrated that SS-31 upregulates frataxin protein expression, which is crucial since frataxin deficiency underlies the major mitochondrial pathology in FRDA; these findings indicate that elamipretide might be repurposed for FRDA (Zhao et al., 2017; Lew et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
Elamipretide’s known mechanism of action revolves around its selective binding to cardiolipin—a unique anionic phospholipid exclusively present in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) that is essential for maintaining mitochondrial cristae architecture and the proper assembly of respiratory chain complexes (Mitchell et al., 2021; Oliver & Reddy, 2019). By binding to cardiolipin, elamipretide stabilizes the mitochondrial inner membrane structure and prevents cardiolipin peroxidation—a key event that leads to cristae disruption and mitochondrial dysfunction during oxidative stress (Tamucci et al., 2023; Viscomi & Zeviani, 2020). This interaction has several downstream biochemical effects:
• It preserves the architecture of mitochondrial cristae, thereby sustaining the optimal organization of respiratory supercomplexes which is critical for efficient electron transport (Allen et al., 2020; Bottani et al., 2020).
• It enhances the coupling efficiency of the ETC, increasing ATP synthesis by reducing electron leakage and associated ROS formation (Zhao et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2020).
• It may also mitigate factors that lead to mitochondrial depolarization and apoptosis under conditions of oxidative stress (Tamucci et al., 2023).

These molecular actions are of particular interest in FRDA because the deficiency of frataxin in this disorder leads to mitochondrial iron overload, impaired assembly and function of iron–sulfur (Fe–S) clusters, and subsequent disruption of ETC complexes and ATP synthesis (Zhao et al., 2017). Moreover, preclinical evidence shows that SS-31 can upregulate frataxin protein levels post-transcriptionally, providing a dual mechanism to counteract the primary defect in FRDA—both by improving mitochondrial bioenergetics through cardiolipin stabilization and by directly increasing the levels of the deficient protein (Zhao et al., 2017; Lew et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the expected effect of elamipretide in FRDA patient cardiomyocytes is to restore mitochondrial cristae integrity and enhance the stability of ETC supercomplexes, thereby boosting maximal respiration and ATP synthesis. In the proposed assay, treatment with elamipretide is predicted to:
• Increase mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), a direct indicator of improved ETC coupling and bioenergetics (Tamucci et al., 2023).
• Enhance maximal ATP synthetic rate (ATPmax) as observed in prior clinical trials with mitochondrial myopathy populations (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
• Reduce ROS accumulation by stabilizing cardiolipin, thereby decreasing oxidative damage within mitochondria, which is particularly relevant in FRDA where high levels of oxidative stress exacerbate cell dysfunction (Jiang et al., 2020; Viscomi & Zeviani, 2020).
• Upregulate frataxin expression in a posttranscriptional manner, which is crucial as frataxin deficiency is the root cause of FRDA pathology (Zhao et al., 2017; Lew et al., 2022).

Furthermore, gene expression studies have established that frataxin is indeed expressed in cardiomyocytes; hence, the restoration of mitochondrial function in this cell type is directly relevant to the cardiac manifestations often observed in FRDA patients (Edzeamey et al., 2024). The proposed assays would measure outcomes such as mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ATP production, ROS levels, and direct imaging of mitochondrial cristae structure, all of which are predicted to improve following elamipretide treatment (Lynch, 2022; Oliver & Reddy, 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
Elamipretide shows significant promise as a repurposed drug candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on several compelling lines of evidence. Its synthetic origins and classification within a well-established drug class of mitochondria-targeted peptides provide a strong technical basis for its development (Mitchell et al., 2022). The extensive preclinical and early clinical data demonstrating improvements in mitochondrial function—particularly in terms of enhanced ATP production, stabilized cristae integrity, and reduced ROS levels—underscore its potential to address the mitochondrial dysfunction that is central to FRDA pathology (Jiang et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2017). Importantly, the ability of SS-31 to upregulate frataxin protein levels uniquely positions it to counteract the primary molecular defect in FRDA (Zhao et al., 2017; Lew et al., 2022).

Strengths of elamipretide for FRDA include its well-characterized mechanism of action—binding to cardiolipin to enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics—and its established safety and tolerability in human trials for related mitochondrial diseases (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Its dual activity of both structural mitochondrial protection and frataxin upregulation is particularly attractive, as it addresses multiple facets of FRDA pathology. Furthermore, the favorable pharmacokinetic and dosing data from previous trials allow for rapid translation into FRDA-focused studies.

However, there are also challenges and weaknesses to consider. Despite promising preclinical data, direct clinical evidence in FRDA patients remains limited, so the translational efficacy in neurodegenerative contexts must be rigorously evaluated. There is also the inherent complexity of FRDA pathology, which extends beyond mitochondrial dysfunction to include systemic iron dysregulation and neuronal degeneration; a mono-therapeutic approach, even one that restores mitochondrial function, may only partially address the disease. Additionally, while the safety profile in other mitochondrial disorders is reassuring, long-term dosing in a pediatric or young adult FRDA population (given the early onset of the disease) may present unique challenges that require dedicated investigation (Lynch, 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In conclusion, the comprehensive literature review strongly supports the hypothesis that elamipretide can enhance mitochondrial cristae integrity and ETC supercomplex stability in FRDA cardiomyocytes, leading to improved maximal respiration and ATP synthesis. The multiple studies referenced affirm its mechanism via cardiolipin binding, the subsequent benefits for mitochondrial function, and its potential to upregulate frataxin—the key protein deficient in FRDA. Thus, elamipretide emerges as a compelling candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia, warranting further preclinical validation in FRDA-specific models as well as early-phase clinical studies to investigate its efficacy in restoring mitochondrial bioenergetics and mitigating the clinical progression of this devastating disease (Mitchell et al., 2021; Viscomi & Zeviani, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).
