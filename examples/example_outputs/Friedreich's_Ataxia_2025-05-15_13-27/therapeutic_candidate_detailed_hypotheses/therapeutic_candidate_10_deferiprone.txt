Proposal for Deferiprone (Ferriprox)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Deferiprone (also known as Ferriprox or L1) is a synthetic, orally active iron chelator belonging to the 3‐hydroxypyridin-4‐one class, originally developed to treat systemic iron overload conditions such as thalassemia major. It was discovered and later synthesized as a low-molecular-weight, bidentate compound capable of effectively binding ferric iron via its two donor atoms, forming a stable 3:1 complex with iron (Chaston & Richardson, 2003). The compound’s chemical structure confers lipophilicity that enables it to cross cellular membranes easily, including the mitochondrial membranes, which is central to its repurposing for diseases characterized by intracellular and mitochondrial iron accumulation (Nuñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018; Kontoghiorghes, 2022). In summary, deferiprone is a synthetic hydroxypyridinone derivative that has been optimized for oral administration and effective chelation of redox-active iron, thereby placing it in a unique class of compounds that have traditionally been used to reduce iron burden in transfusion-dependent patients.

Therapeutic History:
Since its introduction for the management of transfusional siderosis in conditions such as thalassemia major, deferiprone has accumulated extensive clinical experience confirming its long-term safety and efficacy in reducing systemic iron overload (Chaston & Richardson, 2003). Its use in iron overload conditions provided the foundational evidence for repurposing it in diseases involving focal intracellular and mitochondrial iron accumulation. In the specific context of Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA), clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008, 2009; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) have investigated its potential to reduce cardiac iron load and ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction in affected FRDA patients (Kontoghiorghes, 2022). Furthermore, preclinical models and mechanistic studies in neurodegenerative conditions have lent further support by demonstrating that deferiprone can lower mitochondrial iron levels, thereby mitigating oxidative damage—a hallmark shared by FRDA and iron overload disorders (Goncalves et al., 2008; Isaya, 2014). Collectively, these studies underscore a therapeutic history where deferiprone has not only been well characterized for iron overload but is also now being validated in diseases with mitochondrial iron dysregulation such as FRDA.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, deferiprone functions via a well-established mechanism of iron chelation. Its two donor atoms coordinate with ferric iron (Fe3+) in a bidentate fashion to form a 3:1 (ligand:iron) complex, which is subsequently excreted primarily via the urine. This mechanism is critical for depleting labile iron pools that catalyze the Fenton reaction, a process responsible for generating highly reactive hydroxyl radicals, thereby reducing oxidative stress (Chaston & Richardson, 2003). Notably, because deferiprone is small and lipophilic, it is able to cross cellular and mitochondrial membranes, allowing it to directly target the mitochondrial labile iron pool. Excess mitochondrial iron contributes to the impairment of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster–containing enzymes—such as aconitase—which are essential for mitochondrial respiration and energy production; by chelating this iron, deferiprone is hypothesized to preserve the activity of these key enzymes (Goncalves et al., 2008; Vaubel & Isaya, 2013). Additionally, the antioxidant benefits conferred by this chelation are twofold: reducing the pool of catalytic iron required for Fenton chemistry and minimizing subsequent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These combined actions can lead to improvements in mitochondrial bioenergetics and cellular survival in tissues most affected in FRDA, such as cardiomyocytes and neurons (Nuñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018; Devos et al., 2014). The molecular interactions of deferiprone have been characterized across both in vitro biochemical studies and relevant in vivo models, further establishing its mechanism in reducing oxidative damage by modulating mitochondrial iron homeostasis.

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving deferiprone’s repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia is that by chelating excess mitochondrial labile iron, the drug will reduce iron-catalyzed Fenton reactions and associated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This reduction in oxidative stress is expected to preserve the functionality of Fe-S cluster enzymes, such as aconitase, thereby maintaining effective mitochondrial respiration and energy production in FRDA cardiomyocytes and neurons (Goncalves et al., 2008; Isaya, 2014). In a proposed assay setting, one would anticipate finding normalization of both biochemical and mitochondrial biomarkers, including restored activities of enzymes that depend on intact Fe-S clusters, reduced lipid peroxidation products, and overall improved mitochondrial respiration as determined by oxygen consumption measurements (Nuñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018; Vaubel & Isaya, 2013). Moreover, previous clinical data indicate that treatment with deferiprone may yield improvements in cardiac parameters such as reduced left ventricular mass index, which is particularly significant given the high prevalence of cardiomyopathy in FRDA patients (Kruger et al., 2016). In neuronal cells, the expected effect includes reduced markers of oxidative stress and improved cell viability, potentially translating into slowing the progression of ataxic symptoms as measured by established clinical rating scales (Jain et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Deferiprone presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia, particularly due to its ability to target a key pathogenic driver—excess mitochondrial iron resulting in oxidative damage and impaired Fe-S cluster synthesis. Among its strengths is its oral bioavailability and capacity to cross mitochondrial membranes, which differentiates it from larger or poorly absorbed chelators such as desferrioxamine (Chaston & Richardson, 2003; Nuñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018). Its long history of safety and efficacy in managing systemic iron overload further supports its translational potential (Kontoghiorghes, 2022). Mechanistically, the drug capitalizes on reducing the labile iron pool within mitochondria—thereby diminishing ROS production and protecting Fe-S cluster enzymes—which is directly aligned with the molecular pathology observed in FRDA (Goncalves et al., 2008; Vaubel & Isaya, 2013). Studies in preclinical models, as well as early-phase clinical trials identified by ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008, 2009), provide a mechanistic rationale and preliminary evidence suggesting benefits in reducing cardiac iron overload and potentially improving mitochondrial function.

Notwithstanding these strengths, some weaknesses merit consideration. Although deferiprone has demonstrated efficacy in reducing iron deposition, the balance between effective iron chelation and the risk of inducing systemic iron deficiency remains a challenge, particularly given that iron is essential for numerous biological processes (Mounsey & Teismann, 2012). Moreover, clinical responses to deferiprone in FRDA have been variable, with some studies reporting limited neurological improvement—a likely reflection of disease heterogeneity and the possibility that iron accumulation represents a secondary rather than primary defect (Martelli & Puccio, 2014; Chiabrando et al., 2020). Additionally, side effects such as transient neutropenia and agranulocytosis, albeit rare and manageable with careful monitoring, must be factored into the overall risk–benefit assessment (Kontoghiorghes, 2022; Devos et al., 2014). Finally, while the mechanistic foundation is robust, further well-powered, randomized controlled trials are required to definitively confirm that deferiprone’s chelation of mitochondrial iron translates into meaningful, long-term clinical benefits for FRDA patients (Rummey et al., 2018; Jain et al., 2022).

In conclusion, the comprehensive literature review supports deferiprone as a mechanistically rational and promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its ability to chelate excess mitochondrial iron, reduce Fenton-driven ROS production, and preserve Fe-S cluster enzyme function directly addresses core aspects of FRDA pathology. The compound’s oral bioavailability, mitochondrial penetration, and established safety profile in iron overload therapy are significant strengths that lend credence to its repurposing for FRDA (Chaston & Richardson, 2003; Kontoghiorghes, 2022; Nuñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018). However, gaps remain regarding optimal dosing to avoid systemic iron depletion and the need for further robust clinical evidence specifically in FRDA populations (Kruger et al., 2016; Martelli & Puccio, 2014). Overall, while additional clinical trials are essential to fully define its efficacy and long-term safety in FRDA patients, deferiprone’s favorable pharmacological profile and targeted mechanism of reducing mitochondrial iron overload make it a highly promising candidate worthy of continued development in the treatment of Friedreich’s Ataxia.
