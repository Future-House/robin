Proposal for Pioglitazone (Actos)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pioglitazone (marketed as Actos) is a synthetic thiazolidinedione compound originally developed and approved as an insulin sensitizer for type 2 diabetes mellitus. It belongs to the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of therapeutic compounds, which act as selective agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). These compounds were discovered through efforts to find insulin sensitizers and have since been extensively used in metabolic disorders to improve glucose uptake, regulate lipid metabolism, and modulate inflammatory responses (García‐Giménez, Sanchis‐Gomar, & Pallardó, 2011). The structural design of pioglitazone allows it to bind to PPARγ, triggering transcriptional activation of genes primarily involved in adipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Its established pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, with decades of clinical use in the diabetic population, make it an attractive candidate for drug repurposing in other conditions that share overlapping mechanistic abnormalities with type 2 diabetes, such as mitochondrial energy deficits and oxidative stress observed in neurodegenerative diseases like Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) (Mancuso, Orsucci, Choub, & Siciliano, 2010; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, pioglitazone has been used for the management of diabetes due to its ability to enhance insulin sensitivity. This clinical application is supported by robust biochemical and clinical evidence demonstrating that PPARγ activation improves metabolic homeostasis (Pizcueta et al., 2023). Notably, pioglitazone has also been shown in preclinical studies to generate neuroprotective effects in models of neurodegeneration, including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, by modulating inflammatory responses and improving mitochondrial bioenergetics (Mollo et al., 2019). In the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, there has been limited direct clinical investigation; a search on ClinicalTrials.gov for “Pioglitazone AND Friedreich’s Ataxia” returned only one trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris, 2008). Preclinical studies in FRDA cellular models and animal systems, including KIKO mice that recapitulate features of frataxin deficiency, have demonstrated that pioglitazone can upregulate PGC-1α and the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), leading to improved mitochondrial respiration and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (Marmolino et al., 2010; Unknown Reference). These findings, together with evidence from similar neurodegenerative conditions, support the hypothesis that pioglitazone might beneficially impact mitochondrial function and antioxidant defenses in FRDA (García‐Giménez, Sanchis‐Gomar, & Pallardó, 2011; Marmolino et al., 2010).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of action of pioglitazone lies in its capacity to activate PPARγ, a nuclear receptor that, upon binding its ligand, forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). This heterodimer then binds to PPAR response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes, thus regulating transcription. One key downstream effect of PPARγ activation is the upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), which is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism (Mancuso et al., 2010; Unknown Reference). PGC-1α, in turn, orchestrates the transcription of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, including components of the electron transport chain, and antioxidant enzymes such as mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and catalase. In FRDA, a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a deficiency of frataxin, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are central pathological features. Frataxin deficiency impairs the synthesis of iron–sulfur clusters necessary for mitochondrial respiratory chain function, leading to reduced ATP production and increased ROS (García-Giménez et al., 2011; Marmolino et al., 2010). By increasing PGC-1α expression, pioglitazone is expected to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defenses, thereby partially compensating for the mitochondrial deficits seen in FRDA (Marmolino et al., 2010; Unknown Reference). Moreover, PPARγ activation is also associated with anti-inflammatory effects, which could be beneficial in mitigating secondary neurodegeneration associated with oxidative stress and mitochondrial failure (Pizcueta et al., 2023; Morató et al., 2013).

At the molecular level, pioglitazone has been shown to increase the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, such as those encoding mitochondrial enzymes, and to upregulate adiponectin, which further enhances mitochondrial metabolic efficiency. Additionally, by promoting the expression of SOD2 and catalase, the drug is expected to reduce oxidative stress by quenching superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, respectively, thereby protecting cells from ROS-induced damage (Unknown Reference; Kearney, Orrell, Fahey, & Pandolfo, 2012). This molecular cascade of PPARγ activation → PGC-1α upregulation → enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant enzyme expression forms the critical underpinning for the therapeutic rationale in FRDA, where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in disease progression (Marmolino et al., 2010; Unknown Reference).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed in vitro assay using FRDA patient fibroblasts, the expected effect of pioglitazone is multifaceted. Firstly, by binding to PPARγ, pioglitazone should lead to the upregulation of PGC-1α, which is typically downregulated in frataxin-deficient cells. As PGC-1α levels rise, there is an anticipated increase in the transcription of mitochondrial and antioxidant genes, which should result in an improved mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Specifically, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis is expected to elevate the levels of key proteins such as SOD2 and catalase, helping to mitigate the high ROS levels observed in FRDA (Marmolino et al., 2010; Unknown Reference).

Secondly, an increase in antioxidant enzyme activity should lead to a reduction in oxidative damage, thereby stabilizing cellular redox states and improving overall cellular viability. The improvement in mitochondrial respiration, as measured by oxygen consumption rate (OCR), is expected to be a direct consequence of enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and function, ultimately leading to a partial restoration of cellular ATP levels. Additionally, while some studies indicate that pioglitazone may demonstrate only modest effects on frataxin expression itself, the overall enhancement of the mitochondrial network and the bolstering of the antioxidant defense system are thought to yield functional improvements sufficient to slow disease progression in FRDA (Unknown Reference; Pandolfo et al., 2022).

Since FRDA pathology is characterized by increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and compromised energy metabolism, upregulation of PGC-1α and the subsequent restoration of enzymes essential for ROS detoxification are critical. FRDA patient fibroblasts are known to exhibit blunted responses to oxidative challenges, such as hydrogen peroxide exposure; treatment with pioglitazone is therefore hypothesized to normalize the induction of these antioxidant enzymes, thereby reducing oxidative damage and improving cell survival (Marmolino et al., 2010; Unknown Reference). In preclinical models, for instance, KIKO mice treated with pioglitazone showed significant increases in mitochondrial antioxidant markers without a profound change in frataxin levels, suggesting that the therapeutic benefit may be derived primarily from improved mitochondrial function and enhanced oxidative stress resistance (Unknown Reference).

Overall Evaluation:
The comprehensive literature review supports the notion that pioglitazone is a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on its mechanism of action and its effects on mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defenses. One of the key strengths of pioglitazone is its well-characterized clinical safety profile and established pharmacokinetics, which ease the translation from preclinical studies to human clinical trials (Mancuso et al., 2010; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Its molecular mechanism—activation of PPARγ leading to upregulation of PGC-1α and subsequent enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant enzyme expression—is directly relevant to the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying FRDA (Marmolino et al., 2010; Unknown Reference).

Another strength highlighted by multiple studies is the ability of PPARγ agonists to restore impaired mitochondrial function, as evidenced by improved oxygen consumption and reduced ROS production in both cellular and animal FRDA models (Marmolino et al., 2010; Unknown Reference). Moreover, pioglitazone’s capacity to induce antioxidant defenses, particularly through the upregulation of SOD2 and catalase, is critically important given the high oxidative stress burden in FRDA patients (Unknown Reference; Kearney, Orrell, Fahey, & Pandolfo, 2012).

However, there remain certain weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Clinical evidence specifically targeting FRDA with pioglitazone is still very limited; only one clinical trial has been recorded and much of the supportive data come from preclinical models. Furthermore, while pioglitazone has been effective in diabetic and certain neurodegenerative contexts, its impact on frataxin expression in FRDA has been somewhat inconsistent, with some studies noting only minor direct effects on frataxin levels. This suggests that the therapeutic benefit might predominantly arise from improvements in mitochondrial function and redox balance rather than from a substantial correction of frataxin deficiency per se (Unknown Reference; García‐Giménez, Sanchis‐Gomar, & Pallardó, 2011).

Additionally, the safety profile of pioglitazone, though well established in the treatment of diabetes, presents potential concerns when repurposed for FRDA—especially given that FRDA patients often develop cardiomyopathy and other cardiac complications. Side effects such as fluid retention, weight gain, and an increased risk of heart failure are known with TZD drugs, and these risks must be carefully balanced against the potential neurological benefits in FRDA (Morató et al., 2013; Pizcueta et al., 2023).

From a mechanistic standpoint, the hypothesis that pioglitazone will improve mitochondrial respiration through PPARγ activation and subsequent PGC-1α upregulation is well supported by a series of biochemical studies. These studies demonstrate that increasing PGC-1α leads to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and improved antioxidant enzyme expression—a process that can theoretically counteract the mitochondrial deficits observed in FRDA (Marmolino et al., 2010; Unknown Reference). Furthermore, the convergence of improved mitochondrial dynamics, oxidative stress reduction, and modulation of energy metabolism aligns very well with the core pathological processes in FRDA, lending strong mechanistic credibility to the candidate’s potential (Pandolfo et al., 2022; Pizcueta et al., 2023).

In summary, pioglitazone’s established safety profile, its robust mechanism as a PPARγ agonist capable of upregulating PGC-1α and antioxidant defenses, and evidence from preclinical models collectively argue in favor of its repurposing for Friedreich’s Ataxia. While direct clinical data in FRDA are still limited, the convergence of biochemical, cellular, and animal model findings suggests that pioglitazone could have a meaningful therapeutic impact on mitochondrial respiration and oxidative stress parameters typical of FRDA pathology. Key challenges remain, including the need to optimize dosing regimens to achieve sufficient central nervous system (CNS) penetration without exacerbating cardiac risk factors, and the necessity for further clinical trials to confirm efficacy in FRDA patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris, 2008; Morató et al., 2013; Unknown Reference).

Overall, our evaluation indicates that pioglitazone should be considered a promising candidate for further investigation in Friedreich’s Ataxia, with the potential to address multiple facets of the disease’s mitochondrial and oxidative pathology. The next steps would include focused preclinical studies in FRDA-specific models and well-designed early-phase clinical studies in FRDA patients to address the translational gaps and to determine both efficacy and safety in this vulnerable population (Mancuso et al., 2010; Unknown Reference; Pizcueta et al., 2023).
