Proposal for Dynasore

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Dynasore is a cell‐permeable small molecule originally discovered through high‐throughput chemical screening designed to identify inhibitors of clathrin‐mediated endocytosis. Its discovery was driven by the need to impede the GTPase activity of dynamin family proteins, and over time dynasore was established as a powerful tool compound in cell biology. As a synthetic agent, its chemical scaffold was optimized to block the intrinsic GTPase activity that is critical for the conformational changes of dynamin proteins. In particular, dynasore has been shown to inhibit Dynamin 1 and Dynamin 2, as well as the dynamin‐related protein 1 (DRP1), a key mediator of mitochondrial fission (Chen et al., 2023; Misrani et al., 2021). Since DRP1 regulates mitochondrial division by hydrolyzing GTP—a process required for its self-assembly into ring- or spiral-like structures that constrict the mitochondrial outer membrane—dynasore’s inhibition of this activity has notable implications for mitochondrial dynamics. This compound belongs to the class of dynamin inhibitors and has been widely used as a research reagent to interrogate both endocytic and mitochondrial fission pathways in various cellular systems (Clemente et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2023). Its synthetic origins enable investigators to access a molecule that is not only potent but can be applied across a range of experimental models, thereby accelerating efforts to repurpose it for conditions characterized by excessive mitochondrial fragmentation, such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA).

Therapeutic History
Throughout its research history, dynasore has been utilized primarily as a tool to dissect underlying cellular processes. Initially, its key application lay in studies of clathrin‐mediated endocytosis, where dynasore’s inhibition of dynamin activity provided critical insights into vesicular trafficking and receptor internalization. Subsequent studies expanded its use to examining mitochondrial dynamics. In particular, research has demonstrated that by inhibiting DRP1—the dynamin‐related protein responsible for mitochondrial fission—dynasore can reduce the extent of mitochondrial fragmentation in in vitro models. Preclinical studies in neuronal cells have shown that interfering with DRP1’s function can lead to improved mitochondrial integrity, a finding of great relevance to neurodegenerative conditions (Grohm et al., 2012; Oliver & Reddy, 2019). For example, in models of spinal cord injury, dynasore administration improved motor function recovery by decreasing neuronal apoptosis and astrocytic proliferation, highlighting its potential neuroprotective capacity (Li et al., 2017). Although clinical applications specifically targeting Friedreich’s Ataxia have not yet been reported, the extensive preclinical evidence in models of Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders demonstrates that targeting mitochondrial dynamics with dynasore may be a viable approach. In addition, the compound has been used experimentally to modulate intracellular iron uptake and reduce oxidative damage via off‐target effects, which further points toward its pleiotropic impact in mitigating stress‐related cell death in neurons (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Oliver & Reddy, 2019).

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, dynasore exerts its effects by directly inhibiting the GTPase activity of dynamin family proteins. Under normal conditions, DRP1 is largely cytosolic but is recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane in response to cellular cues that demand mitochondrial division. Upon recruitment, DRP1 oligomerizes into ring-like structures around the mitochondria and hydrolyzes GTP to generate the mechanical force required for membrane constriction and subsequent fission (Reddy et al., 2011; Oliver & Reddy, 2019). Dynasore binds to the GTPase domain of DRP1 and related dynamins, thereby impairing their capacity to bind or hydrolyze GTP. This impedes the conformational changes necessary for oligomerization and membrane scission, effectively reducing the rate of mitochondrial fission (Martinez et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2019).

In addition to its direct inhibition of DRP1, dynasore has been documented to have additional cellular activities. For instance, its use in neuronal models has revealed that dynasore can reduce intracellular iron uptake by interfering with dynamin‐dependent endocytosis of transferrin receptors—a process that ultimately reduces the availability of iron for mitochondrial operations—and also acts as a radical-trapping antioxidant that scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Clemente et al., 2020; Misrani et al., 2021). These ancillary effects, while complicating the precise attribution of outcomes entirely to DRP1 inhibition, may confer additional cytoprotective benefits by mitigating iron-induced oxidative stress, a common feature in neurodegenerative conditions and FRDA.

From a structural standpoint, dynasore’s interference with the enzymatic cycle of DRP1 leads to a reduction in the excessive fission events that can result in fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. Mitochondrial fragmentation is detrimental given that it disrupts the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), impairs electron transport chain efficiency, and decreases ATP production (Oliver & Reddy, 2019; Reddy et al., 2011). Through the inhibition of DRP1’s GTPase activity, dynasore is expected to shift the balance toward mitochondrial fusion, thereby promoting a more interconnected and stable mitochondrial network. This shift could directly enhance oxidative phosphorylation by improving the coupling efficiency between the electron transport chain complexes and ATP synthase—a critical parameter measured by the ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (Reddy et al., 2011; Martinez et al., 2023).

The impact of dynasore on DRP1 has been further elucidated in studies that examine the downstream effects on mitochondrial quality control mechanisms such as mitophagy. In healthy cells, a balanced interplay between fission and fusion ensures that damaged mitochondria are segregated and subsequently removed via autophagic processes. In cases where excessive mitochondrial fission occurs, the efficiency of mitophagy is compromised, leading to the accumulation of depolarized and dysfunctional mitochondria. By reducing DRP1-mediated fission, dynasore may help restore mitophagic efficiency, ensuring that damaged mitochondrial fragments are appropriately targeted for degradation and removal, thereby maintaining a healthy mitochondrial population (Reddy et al., 2011; Oliver & Reddy, 2019).

Expected Effect
Friedreich’s Ataxia is characterized by a complex interplay of mitochondrial dysfunction, including impaired energy production, oxidative stress, and disruptions in mitochondrial quality control. In FRDA, frataxin deficiency leads to iron accumulation, increased cellular oxidative stress, and compromised mitochondrial bioenergetics. The proposed therapeutic hypothesis for dynasore in FRDA is that by inhibiting GTPase-dependent DRP1 activity, it will reduce excessive mitochondrial fission, promote mitochondrial fusion, and thereby stabilize the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). The anticipated result is an improvement in the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, ultimately reflected by an increase in ATP-linked OCR and overall enhanced bioenergetic function in FRDA patient neurons (Martinez et al., 2023; Oliver & Reddy, 2019).

In practice, the expected effects of dynasore in FRDA models can be broken down into several interrelated therapeutic benefits. First, by inhibiting DRP1 activity, dynasore should lead to a reduction in mitochondrial fragmentation. In FRDA, excessive fission contributes to a population of small, fragmented mitochondria that exhibit lower Δψm and an impaired capacity for ATP production. By promoting a shift towards mitochondrial fusion, dynasore is expected to help restore a more interconnected mitochondrial network. This interconnectivity is beneficial because it facilitates the distribution of mitochondrial DNA, proteins, and substrates across the network, thereby supporting more robust and efficient oxidative phosphorylation (Chen et al., 2023; Reddy et al., 2011).

Second, stabilization of Δψm is crucial for maintaining the electrochemical gradient used by ATP synthase to produce ATP. In neurons, which are highly dependent on mitochondrial ATP production for synaptic transmission and overall cellular homeostasis, the preservation of Δψm directly translates into improved functional capacity. Improvements in Δψm, driven by dynasore’s reduction of pathological fission, are expected to enhance electron transport chain activity, reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species, and promote more efficient ATP-linked respiration (Oliver & Reddy, 2019; Martinez et al., 2023).

Third, by modulating the balance of mitochondrial dynamics, dynasore may foster a cellular environment that is more conducive to effective mitophagy. In FRDA, the accumulation of damaged or depolarized mitochondria exacerbates oxidative stress and further undermines bioenergetic efficiency. By rebalancing fission and fusion, dynasore is anticipated to enable more efficient segregation and removal of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy. This, in turn, should reduce intracellular oxidative stress and improve overall mitochondrial quality, thereby sustaining the energy production demands necessary for neuronal survival (Chidipi et al., 2022; Edenharter et al., 2018).

Moreover, additional off-target effects of dynasore—such as the reduction in intracellular iron uptake and its radical-trapping antioxidant properties—could provide further therapeutic benefits in FRDA. Since FRDA is associated with mitochondrial iron overload and consequent oxidative damage, the reduction in iron availability and direct scavenging of reactive oxygen species may attenuate the oxidative stress burden on neurons. This dual action, while complicating the pure attribution to DRP1 inhibition, might synergistically complement the primary mechanism by improving mitochondrial respiration indirectly (Clemente et al., 2020; Misrani et al., 2021).

Overall, the expected effect of dynasore in an FRDA context is a cascade of beneficial cellular events: restoration of mitochondrial network morphology, stabilization of Δψm, improved electron transport and ATP-linked oxygen consumption, and enhanced clearance of damaged mitochondria through more effective mitophagy. Together, these effects should converge to improve bioenergetic parameters in FRDA patient neurons, potentially translating into neuroprotective outcomes and better cellular survival in the face of frataxin deficiency (Oliver & Reddy, 2019; Reddy et al., 2011).

Overall Evaluation
The overall evaluation of dynasore as a therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia is characterized by a cautiously optimistic perspective that acknowledges both significant strengths and notable weaknesses.

Strengths.
One of the primary strengths of dynasore lies in its well-established mechanism of action. As a potent inhibitor of dynamin family GTPases, especially DRP1, dynasore directly addresses a critical dysregulation observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, including FRDA. Excessive DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission is increasingly recognized as a contributor to mitochondrial fragmentation, diminished membrane potential, and impaired ATP production. Dynasore’s ability to inhibit the GTPase activity of DRP1 is well supported by biochemical studies demonstrating improvements in mitochondrial morphology and function upon DRP1 inhibition (Oliver & Reddy, 2019; Reddy et al., 2011). Moreover, dynasore has a history of robust performance in various experimental models, ranging from in vitro cell culture assays to in vivo studies in animal models of neurodegeneration. For instance, its demonstrated efficacy in reducing neuronal apoptosis and improving motor outcomes in spinal cord injury models provides a foundation for its potential utility in FRDA (Li et al., 2017). Additionally, by stabilizing Δψm and enhancing ATP-linked oxygen consumption through the promotion of mitochondrial fusion, dynasore targets the bioenergetic deficits that are central to FRDA pathology (Martinez et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023).

Another key strength is its cell‐permeable nature and the extensive body of preclinical research supporting its use as a research tool. The compound’s synthetic origin and the relative ease with which it is available for laboratory studies allow for rapid investigation into its mechanistic effects on mitochondrial dynamics in FRDA patient-derived neuronal cultures or animal models. This availability is pivotal for early-phase drug development programs looking to repurpose established research reagents for new therapeutic indications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Oliver & Reddy, 2019).

Weaknesses.
Notwithstanding these strengths, there are several challenges associated with repurposing dynasore for FRDA. A major concern arises from its lack of specificity. Dynasore is known to inhibit several dynamin family proteins—not only DRP1, which regulates mitochondrial fission, but also Dynamin 1 and Dynamin 2, which are essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis and other critical cellular processes. Such broad activity raises the risk of off-target effects that could disrupt neuronal functions such as synaptic vesicle recycling, potentially exacerbating cellular dysfunction in an already vulnerable FRDA neuronal population (Clemente et al., 2020; Misrani et al., 2021).

Another potential drawback is the pleiotropic nature of dynasore’s actions. In addition to inhibiting DRP1, dynasore has been reported to reduce intracellular iron uptake and to act as a direct scavenger of reactive oxygen species. While these effects might be beneficial in reducing the oxidative stress that accompanies FRDA, they confound the interpretation of results by making it difficult to attribute any observed therapeutic benefits solely to the modulation of mitochondrial fission (Clemente et al., 2020; Misrani et al., 2021). This multiplicity of action could complicate dose calibration and toxicity assessments. In scenarios where excessive inhibition of DRP1 could lead to overly fused mitochondria, there is also a risk that mitophagy—the process required for the removal of damaged mitochondria—may be impaired, resulting in the accumulation of dysfunctional organelles. Therefore, achieving an optimal therapeutic window that balances DRP1 inhibition with adequate mitochondrial turnover will be a critical challenge (Reddy et al., 2011; Oliver & Reddy, 2019).

Furthermore, though there is promising in vitro and animal model evidence on dynasore’s efficacy in modulating mitochondrial dynamics in neurodegenerative models, direct evidence of its beneficial effects in FRDA-specific models remains sparse. FRDA is a multifaceted disease characterized not only by mitochondrial fragmentation but also by frataxin deficiency, iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis impairment, and chronic oxidative stress. Without direct preclinical studies demonstrating that dynasore can restore mitochondrial membrane potential, improve ATP-linked OCR, and enhance mitophagy in FRDA models, its translation into a FRDA therapeutic remains hypothetical (Chidipi et al., 2022; Edenharter et al., 2018).

Lastly, the pharmacokinetic profile, bioavailability, and long-term toxicity of dynasore in therapeutic contexts have not yet been fully characterized. While dynasore has proven its worth as a research reagent in cellular models, its adaptation for clinical use requires extensive optimization in terms of dosing regimens and safety evaluations. This represents an additional hurdle that must be overcome before considering clinical trials in FRDA (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation and Recommendation
In summary, dynasore presents a compelling mechanistic rationale for repurposing as a therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its well-documented inhibition of DRP1’s GTPase activity offers a direct strategy to tackle the excessive mitochondrial fission that is implicated in the mitochondrial dysfunction observed in FRDA. By stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential, enhancing the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and potentially promoting more effective mitophagy, dynasore is hypothesized to ameliorate the bioenergetic deficits that contribute to neuronal degeneration in FRDA (Oliver & Reddy, 2019; Reddy et al., 2011). The extensive preclinical use of dynasore in models of neurodegeneration, along with its pivotal role as a research tool, adds further weight to the proposition of investigating its effects in FRDA-specific systems (Grohm et al., 2012; Martinez et al., 2023).

However, significant challenges remain. The lack of absolute specificity toward DRP1 and the potential for off-target inhibition of essential dynamin-related processes pose risks that must be carefully managed. The compound’s additional activities—such as modulation of intracellular iron uptake and direct antioxidant effects—while possibly beneficial, complicate the mechanistic interpretation and require precise experimental delineation. Moreover, an overly aggressive inhibition of DRP1 may disrupt the necessary balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion, potentially impairing the normal turnover of mitochondria via mitophagy and causing deleterious effects on cellular homeostasis (Reddy et al., 2011; Oliver & Reddy, 2019). Direct studies in FRDA patient-derived neurons or animal models will be critical to determine whether dynasore can deliver the anticipated improvements in Δψm stabilization, ATP-linked OCR, and overall neuronal bioenergetics without incurring unacceptable side effects.

Given these considerations, our overall evaluation is one of guarded optimism. Dynasore’s robust mechanistic basis as an inhibitor of GTPase-dependent DRP1 activity aligns well with the therapeutic needs of FRDA, where mitochondrial dysfunction is a central pathogenic feature. Its prior demonstration of efficacy in diverse neurodegenerative contexts further underscores its potential. Nonetheless, the inherent challenges relating to off-target effects, dose calibration, and the need for direct efficacy data in FRDA models cannot be overlooked. To advance dynasore as a repurposed candidate for FRDA, we recommend a systematic, multi-phase research approach that includes:

1. Detailed in vitro studies using FRDA patient-derived neuronal cultures to assess the effects of dynasore on mitochondrial morphology, membrane potential, and ATP-linked respiration. These studies should incorporate assays to monitor mitophagy efficiency and evaluate any off-target impacts on endocytic pathways.
2. In vivo testing in appropriate animal models of FRDA to evaluate the compound’s pharmacokinetic parameters, bioavailability, and neuroprotective efficacy. Long-term studies should assess whether sustained DRP1 inhibition correlates with improved motor and cognitive outcomes without perturbing essential cellular processes.
3. Dose-ranging studies to identify a therapeutic window in which dynasore can reduce excessive mitochondrial fission while preserving the minimal basal fission necessary for mitochondrial quality control.
4. Exploration of combination therapies wherein dynasore’s DRP1 inhibition is complemented by agents that target other aspects of FRDA pathology—such as compounds that enhance mitochondrial biogenesis or directly ameliorate frataxin deficiency—to achieve a more holistic correction of mitochondrial dysfunction.

In conclusion, while dynasore represents an innovative candidate with a compelling mechanism of action in theory, its successful translation from a research tool to a therapeutic agent for Friedreich’s Ataxia hinges on the resolution of several critical challenges. These include establishing its specificity, managing its pleiotropic effects, and proving its efficacy in FRDA-specific models. Given the pressing need for effective interventions in FRDA, the potential for dynasore to restore mitochondrial homeostasis remains an appealing avenue worthy of further preclinical exploration. With methodical and rigorous testing, dynasore could indeed contribute to a new generation of therapeutics aimed at correcting mitochondrial dynamics and improving bioenergetic outcomes in patients suffering from Friedreich’s Ataxia (Chen et al., 2023; Oliver & Reddy, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
