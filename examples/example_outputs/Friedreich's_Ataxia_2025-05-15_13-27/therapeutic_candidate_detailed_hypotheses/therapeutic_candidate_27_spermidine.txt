Proposal for Spermidine

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Spermidine is a naturally occurring polyamine present in cells and abundant in the diet through foods such as aged cheese, wheat germ, nuts, and soybeans. Its endogenous synthesis occurs via the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) pathway and it is also produced by gut microbes. As a small molecule, spermidine belongs to the polyamine class of compounds, which have been recognized for their roles in cellular proliferation, autophagy regulation, and modulation of mitochondrial function. Historically, polyamines were discovered in the mid-twentieth century and have since been associated with diverse cellular processes including modulation of oxidative stress, gene expression, and protein translation. In particular, spermidine has garnered attention for its ability to induce autophagy—a process essential for cellular quality control—by modulating acetyltransferase activity and influencing posttranslational modifications such as the hypusination of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). This compound, therefore, represents a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of conditions characterized by impaired autophagy and mitochondrial quality control such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (Al-Habsi et al., 2022; Zimmermann et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Spermidine’s therapeutic potential has been explored in a range of preclinical models across aging, neurodegeneration, and cardioprotection, where its ability to enhance autophagic flux and mitochondrial bioenergetics has led to lifespan extension and improved cellular function. In multiple studies, spermidine treatment in murine and Drosophila models has been shown to restore mitochondrial ATP production, enhance mitochondrial respiration, and improve fatty acid oxidation by activating mitochondrial trifunctional protein, a crucial regulator of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation processes (Al-Habsi et al., 2022; Hofer et al., 2021). Clinical and epidemiological investigations, such as those emerging from human dietary intake studies (e.g., the Bruneck study), have supported an inverse correlation between spermidine consumption and cognitive decline, underscoring its potential translational benefits in age-related neurodegenerative diseases (Hofer et al., 2021). Although spermidine itself has not been directly trialed in Friedreich’s Ataxia, its mechanism of action parallels other therapeutic strategies that aim to restore mitochondrial quality and boost autophagy—such as rapamycin, which has been evaluated in FRDA models to promote mitochondrial and antioxidant defenses (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015; Bürk, 2017). In veterinary and clinical settings, while spermidine’s safety profile remains favorable due to its natural occurrence in food, its use has primarily been in the context of aging research rather than an established treatment for FRDA or other inherited mitochondrial disorders (Xu et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, spermidine exerts its effects by inducing macroautophagy, a critical cellular degradation pathway that facilitates the removal of damaged proteins and organelles through the formation of autophagosomes. One of the best-characterized mechanisms involves the inhibition of the acetyltransferase EP300, thereby reducing protein acetylation and subsequently de-repressing autophagic gene expression. Additionally, spermidine is essential for the hypusination of eIF5A—a unique posttranslational modification necessary for the translation of specific autophagy-related proteins such as ATG3. This modification not only boosts autophagic flux but is also closely linked to enhanced mitochondrial protein translation and stability, ultimately leading to an elevation in mitochondrial respiration and ATP production (Hofer et al., 2021; Zimmermann et al., 2023).

Spermidine also directly interacts with mitochondrial enzymes; for example, it reportedly binds to the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP) complex with high affinity (Kd ~0.1 mM), thereby allosterically enhancing fatty acid β-oxidation. This interaction supports improved mitochondrial fuel utilization and energy generation, which is particularly important in cells suffering from mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition to its metabolic actions, spermidine alleviates oxidative stress by suppressing overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and reducing the initiation of apoptosis under conditions of cellular stress (Al-Habsi et al., 2022; Fairley et al., 2023).

Furthermore, the compound modulates mitophagy—the selective autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria—by upregulating key mediators such as PINK1 and Parkin, which are critical for marking dysfunctional mitochondria for degradation. The activation of these pathways is pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control, especially in tissues with high energy demands, such as neuronal and cardiac tissues, which are profoundly affected in FRDA (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015; Fairley et al., 2023). Therefore, spermidine’s multitarget mechanism comprising autophagy induction, mitochondrial enzyme activation, mitigation of oxidative stress, and enhancement of mitophagy forms the basis for its hypothesized therapeutic benefit in FRDA.

Expected Effect:
In the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, where frataxin deficiency leads to mitochondrial iron accumulation, impaired iron–sulfur cluster synthesis, increased ROS production, and compromised mitochondrial ATP production, the expected effect of spermidine would be multifold. By activating autophagy, spermidine should promote the clearance of damaged mitochondria and reduce the cellular burden of dysfunctional organelles. This activity is anticipated to restore mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and elevate ATP production by ensuring that only functionally competent mitochondria are retained within the cell (Al-Habsi et al., 2022; Fairley et al., 2023).

Moreover, spermidine-induced upregulation of mitophagy via the PINK1/Parkin pathway should lead to a reduction of oxidative stress markers by eliminating mitochondria that overproduce ROS. In FRDA patient fibroblasts, where defective mitochondria accumulate due to impaired autophagic turnover, such intervention is expected to lower intracellular oxidative stress and ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, by enhancing the activity of mitochondrial trifunctional proteins, spermidine may further improve fatty acid oxidation efficiency and cellular energy metabolism. In functional assays, these actions would translate to improved mitochondrial respiration parameters, increased cell viability, and restoration of energy homeostasis, thereby addressing the bioenergetic deficits observed in FRDA cells (Fairley et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2016).

At the molecular level, increased expression of autophagy markers such as LC3 and P62 and increased levels of mitophagy regulators (e.g., PINK1/Parkin) in FRDA fibroblasts upon spermidine treatment would support the hypothesis. Consistent with data from neurodegenerative models, enhanced autophagic flux would likely correlate with improved mitochondrial quality control and ATP generation, thereby compensating for the frataxin deficiency-induced metabolic impairments (Bürk, 2017; Xu et al., 2020).

Overall, the expected phenotypic outcome in treated FRDA patient fibroblasts would be a significant reduction in the proportion of damaged mitochondria accompanied by restoration of Δψm and increased ATP levels, which could ultimately improve cellular function and survival—a therapeutic effect highly desirable in disorders characterized by mitochondrial insufficiency (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015; Fairley et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
The evidence collected from multiple preclinical studies and mechanistic investigations supports the hypothesis that spermidine may be a promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its natural occurrence and dietary presence suggest favorable tolerability and an established safety profile in long-term administration, making it an attractive candidate for repurposing. The compound’s dual action—in inducing macroautophagy and boosting mitophagy via the PINK1/Parkin pathway—aligns well with the pathological mechanisms observed in FRDA, where mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and defective organelle turnover are central features (Al-Habsi et al., 2022; Fairley et al., 2023; Bürk, 2017).

Strengths of spermidine include its multifaceted mechanism of action: it not only activates autophagic pathways to clear damaged mitochondria but also enhances mitochondrial respiration and ATP production via the activation of mitochondrial trifunctional protein. This integrated approach directly addresses the bioenergetic deficits and oxidative stress observed in FRDA and similar mitochondrial disorders. Additionally, the extensive preclinical data demonstrating lifespan extension and neuroprotection in various animal models lends further support to its therapeutic potential (Al-Habsi et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2020).

However, several weaknesses and challenges remain. While the majority of evidence is derived from models of aging and neurodegeneration—such as Alzheimer’s disease and tauopathy models—direct experimental data in FRDA models are limited to indirect mechanistic rationales based on shared mitochondrial dysfunction. There is no direct clinical or robust preclinical data demonstrating effectiveness in FRDA patient fibroblasts or in animal models of FRDA specifically. This gap indicates the need for dedicated studies to assess the pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and dosing of spermidine in FRDA-relevant systems (Watchon et al., 2024). Moreover, it will be important to confirm that the molecular targets of spermidine—such as the mitochondrial trifunctional protein and the eIF5A hypusination machinery—are expressed and functionally relevant in FRDA patient cells, particularly fibroblasts, to ensure that the proposed mechanisms are operative in the intended target population (Fairley et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2016).

In conclusion, despite the current lack of direct clinical evidence in FRDA, the preclinical and biochemical rationale for using spermidine as a repurposed therapeutic candidate is strong, based on its ability to promote autophagy and mitophagy, restore mitochondrial function, and enhance cellular ATP production. These actions address key pathophysiological features of FRDA, notably mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. The compound’s favorable oral tolerability and established safety profile further support its developmental feasibility. However, further studies are warranted to directly evaluate spermidine’s efficacy in FRDA models and to optimize its dosing regimen in FRDA patient fibroblasts and, eventually, in clinical trials (Al-Habsi et al., 2022; Fairley et al., 2023; Bürk, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Overall, spermidine represents a promising candidate for further investigation in Friedreich’s Ataxia, with the potential to improve mitochondrial clearance, restore bioenergetic capacity, and ameliorate disease progression through its multifaceted molecular actions.
