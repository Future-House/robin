Proposal for Deferasirox (Exjade)

Below is a detailed evaluation of Deferasirox (Exjade) as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia, structured as a scientific proposal review.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Deferasirox (marketed as Exjade) is an orally active, synthetic iron chelator that belongs to a class of tridentate bis‐hydroxyphenyl‐triazole compounds. It was developed through a rational drug design program to overcome the limitations of earlier iron chelation agents such as deferoxamine, which suffers from the inconvenience of parenteral administration and poor cell penetration. Deferasirox binds ferric iron with high affinity, forming a stable 2:1 complex with Fe(III). The structural design—synthesized in two steps starting from a salicylic acid derivative—yields a compound that is highly lipophilic enough to allow improved bioavailability yet selective for iron over other metals. Its oral bioavailability (approximately 70%), long plasma half‐life (typically 8 to 16 hours, with some reports even noting sustained levels conducive to once-daily dosing), and extensive protein binding (roughly 99% bound to serum albumin) have made it the agent of choice for managing transfusional iron overload in conditions such as β-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (Stumpf, 2007; Tanaka, 2014). Belonging to the synthetic iron chelator class, its development represents a shift from natural siderophores to rationally designed molecules with improved pharmacokinetic properties, and its chemical class has been used extensively in the management of systemic iron overload. Although initially developed for hematological conditions, its chemical profile suggests that, if it accesses intracellular or even mitochondrial iron pools, it could have broader applications.

Therapeutic History:
Deferasirox’s therapeutic history is extensive in the context of chronic iron overload. Clinically, it has been approved since 2005 by regulatory authorities worldwide to manage iron overload in transfusion-dependent patients, particularly in thalassemia major, sickle cell disease, and myelodysplastic syndromes (Stumpf, 2007; Tanaka, 2014). Over the years extensive phase II and III clinical trials have established its efficacy in lowering serum ferritin levels and reducing liver iron concentration, while its oral formulation greatly improves compliance compared to the parenteral administration required with deferoxamine (Piga & Cappellini, 2006; Palumbo et al., 2021). In addition, its pharmacokinetic profile and favorable safety data have been demonstrated in both pediatric and adult populations (Stumpf, 2007; Entezari et al., 2022). Notably, while clinical usage in systemic iron overload has been robust with decades of patient experience, there are no formally registered clinical trials evaluating deferasirox specifically in Friedreich’s Ataxia or other mitochondrial iron overload disorders as confirmed by recent searches (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, the biochemical rationale of iron chelation in diseases with mitochondrial iron dysregulation, as seen in Friedreich’s Ataxia, has been extensively discussed in the literature (Chaston & Richardson, 2003; Núñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018). Thus, although it has not yet been applied directly in FRDA patient populations, the demonstrated clinical utility of deferasirox in other iron overload conditions supports its potential repurposing.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, deferasirox functions by selectively chelating ferric iron (Fe3+) in both extracellular and intracellular compartments. Its tridentate ligand structure allows it to form a 2:1 complex with iron, thereby sequestering free iron and reducing the labile iron pool (LIP) responsible for catalyzing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via Fenton chemistry. The drug’s high affinity for Fe3+ reduces the availability of iron that may otherwise participate in redox cycling reactions which produce hydroxyl radicals and other cytotoxic species (Tanaka, 2014; Stumpf, 2007). Furthermore, while much of its clinical benefit in iron overload stems from its ability to facilitate excretion through the biliary system, there is preclinical evidence suggesting that its ability to bind intracellular iron may extend to iron in mitochondrial compartments (Unknown Reference; Vaubel & Isaya, 2013). In iron overload conditions, excess iron accumulates in tissues such as the liver and heart; in the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, mitochondrial iron accumulation is a hallmark owing to frataxin deficiency. The reduced frataxin levels in FRDA cells impair proper iron–sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly, leading to a buildup of mitochondrial iron and subsequent oxidative stress (Llorens et al., 2019; Santos et al., 2010). While deferasirox was primarily developed to remove iron from systemic pools, its physicochemical properties—including its moderate lipophilicity and oral bioavailability—suggest that it might also access intracellular iron reserves, including those in the mitochondria (Stumpf, 2007; Tanaka, 2014). This is supported by mechanistic studies showing that iron chelators sharing similar enzymatic targeting have been shown to mitigate mitochondrial oxidative stress by expanding the mitochondrial iron chelatable pool (Chaston & Richardson, 2003; Rodríguez et al., 2020). However, compared to smaller chelators such as deferiprone, which have demonstrated superior mitochondrial penetration (Lee et al., 2016), there is some uncertainty whether deferasirox can achieve sufficiently high mitochondrial concentrations. Nonetheless, its strong binding affinity and sustained plasma levels may yield a net reduction in the labile iron pool even if only a fraction of the drug accesses the mitochondria (Núñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018; Ward et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis driving the repurposing strategy for Friedreich's Ataxia posits that deferasirox will bind mitochondrial iron with high affinity in FRDA cells, thereby lowering the labile iron pool, decreasing ROS generation, and normalizing complex I-driven oxygen consumption. In FRDA, frataxin deficiency is known to lead to mitochondrial iron accumulation, contributing to excessive ROS generation through Fenton reactions, and impairing the activity of mitochondrial iron–sulfur proteins such as complex I and aconitase (Llorens et al., 2019; Santos et al., 2010). By chelating excess mitochondrial iron, deferasirox is expected to reduce oxidative stress, which is a key driver of mitochondrial dysfunction in FRDA. Moreover, by “normalizing” the labile iron pool, deferasirox could help restore proper mitochondrial function, including the reactivation of complex I-driven oxygen consumption—a parameter that is often depressed in FRDA due to iron-induced oxidative damage (Rodríguez et al., 2020; Marmolino, 2011). This proposed effect is based on the concept that reducing redox-active iron will lead to lower generation of hydroxyl radicals, thereby attenuating the cascade of mitochondrial damage that results from oxidative stress. At the cellular level, the expected cascade involves decreased iron-mediated ROS production, improved functionality of iron–sulfur cluster enzymes, and ultimately enhanced ATP production and reduced apoptotic signaling. This mechanism is supported by preclinical studies in which iron chelation has improved cellular bioenergetics and reduced oxidative markers in models of mitochondrial iron overload (Chaston & Richardson, 2003; Vaubel & Isaya, 2013). Additionally, indirect evidence from studies involving other chelators such as deferiprone in FRDA models has shown that lowering mitochondrial iron can delay or reverse some aspects of the pathological phenotype (Lee et al., 2016; Núñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018). Thus, it is anticipated that in an assay using FRDA-derived cells, deferasirox treatment would yield measurable improvements in mitochondrial respiration rates and reductions in oxidative stress biomarkers.

Overall Evaluation:
The comprehensive review of the literature supports the notion that deferasirox has several strengths as a repurposed candidate for Friedreich's Ataxia, yet there remain significant uncertainties that must be addressed in further studies.

Strengths include:
•  Established Clinical Safety and Pharmacokinetics: Deferasirox has a well-documented safety profile and robust PK/ADME data from its long-term use in patients with transfusional iron overload. The oral bioavailability, long half-life, once-daily dosing regimen, and predictable pharmacokinetics observed in thalassemic patients provide a strong foundation from which to repurpose the drug (Stumpf, 2007; Tanaka, 2014; Palumbo et al., 2021).
•  Mechanistic Rationale: The central role of mitochondrial iron accumulation and oxidative stress in FRDA pathogenesis makes iron chelation an attractive therapeutic strategy. Deferasirox’s ability to chelate ferric iron with high affinity could theoretically reduce the labile iron pool responsible for ROS generation and thereby improve mitochondrial function (Llorens et al., 2019; Santos et al., 2010).
•  Oral Administration and Patient Compliance: As an oral agent, deferasirox circumvents the compliance issues associated with parenteral chelators such as deferoxamine. This is especially relevant in a chronic neurodegenerative condition like FRDA, where long-term treatment adherence is critical (Stumpf, 2007; Palumbo et al., 2021).

Weaknesses and Concerns include:
•  Mitochondrial Penetration Uncertainty: Although the compound is effective at reducing systemic iron overload, there is limited direct evidence that deferasirox accumulates in mitochondria to an extent sufficient for therapeutic efficacy in FRDA. In preclinical studies, other chelators like deferiprone have shown greater mitochondrial access, which casts some doubt on whether deferasirox can adequately lower mitochondrial labile iron (Lee et al., 2016; Núñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018; Ward et al., 2021).
•  Lack of Direct Clinical Evidence in FRDA: To date, no clinical trials have formally evaluated the efficacy of deferasirox in Friedreich’s Ataxia patients. While theoretical and mechanistic support exists, the absence of direct clinical data regarding its impact on mitochondrial iron, ROS levels, or clinical outcomes in FRDA remains a significant gap (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chaston & Richardson, 2003).
•  Potential Impact on Iron-Dependent Processes: FRDA is a condition in which not only is iron accumulation problematic, but proper iron utilization is already compromised due to frataxin deficiency. There is a theoretical risk that iron chelation might inadvertently deplete iron needed for essential cellular functions if not dosed carefully, although the demonstrated safety in iron overload patients is reassuring (Tanaka, 2014; Vaubel & Isaya, 2013).

In summary, the overall evaluation is cautiously optimistic. Deferasirox emerges as a promising candidate based on its robust clinical history in iron overload disorders, well-characterized pharmacokinetics, and established safety profile. Mechanistically, its ability to bind ferric iron and reduce the labile iron pool is directly relevant to addressing mitochondrial iron-mediated oxidative stress—one of the core pathophysiological features in Friedreich's Ataxia (Llorens et al., 2019; Santos et al., 2010). Its oral route of administration further enhances its appeal for long-term, chronic diseases. However, significant gaps exist regarding its capacity to penetrate mitochondria and effectively chelate the mitochondrial iron that is central to FRDA pathology. Consequently, while the theoretical rationale is strong and preclinical models support iron chelation strategies, extensive additional research—both in vitro using FRDA-derived cell models and in vivo in relevant animal models—is needed to confirm mitochondrial bioavailability, optimize dosing, and determine potential effects on mitochondrial respiratory function and antioxidant defenses (Rodríguez et al., 2020; Marmolino, 2011).

Overall, we conclude that deferasirox possesses potential for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its strengths in pharmacokinetics, safety, and mechanism of reducing labile iron and oxidative stress are compelling. However, the weaknesses underscore the need for targeted preclinical studies to verify mitochondrial targeting and to evaluate the balance between efficacious iron chelation and preservation of essential iron-dependent mitochondrial processes. Thus, while deferasirox should be considered a promising candidate and prioritized for further mechanistic and preclinical evaluation, caution and rigorous experimental validation are warranted before initiating clinical trials in FRDA patients (Chaston & Richardson, 2003; Tanaka, 2014; Ward et al., 2021).
