Proposal for KH176

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
KH176, also known by its later clinical designation sonlicromanol, is a synthetic, orally bioavailable, water‐soluble compound developed as a mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and redox modulator. It traces its origins to modifications of Trolox, a vitamin E derivative known for its antioxidant properties, but KH176 has been rationally optimized to specifically target mitochondrial redox imbalance rather than acting as a broad-spectrum antioxidant. This compound falls within the class of redox modulators, which are a subset of small‐molecule therapeutics designed to restore cellular redox homeostasis and improve mitochondrial function. The development process, involving advanced screening methods including automated image quantification and machine learning applied to patient‐derived fibroblast models with mitochondrial dysfunction, enabled the identification of KH176 for its potent ROS‐scavenging capabilities and its ability to enhance bioenergetic parameters in defective cellular models (Beyrath et al., 2018, pp. 2–3). Compounds of this class have historically been exploited for their ability to ameliorate oxidative stress in a variety of pathologies, and they have seen use in experimental settings for neuromuscular and mitochondrial disorders. In the case of KH176, its chemical structure has been fine‐tuned to provide favorable pharmacokinetics (PK), including blood–brain barrier permeability, and an acceptable safety profile, all of which are essential attributes for repurposing in neurodegenerative and multisystem mitochondrial diseases such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (FA) (Liufu & Wang, 2021, pp. 3–5).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of KH176 is notable for its progressive advancement through early-phase clinical studies. Initially evaluated in Phase I single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) studies in healthy male volunteers, KH176 demonstrated a favorable safety profile with well‐tolerated doses up to 800 mg in single-dose administrations and 400 mg twice daily in multiple-dose settings, with manageable and predictable pharmacokinetics (Koene et al., 2017, pp. 1–2). These early human studies, which detailed dose-dependent exposure and minimal adverse cardiac effects (provided dosing remained below critical plasma concentrations), established the foundational safety necessary to progress further into patient-centric trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Subsequently, KH176 progressed into Phase II trials exemplified by the KHENERGY study in patients with mitochondrial m.3243A>G spectrum disorders—a genetically defined subset of mitochondrial diseases. Although this trial primarily focused on mitochondrial disorders associated with the m.3243A>G mutation, the resulting safety and exploratory efficacy data (including improvements in neuropsychological outcomes such as alertness and mood, as well as some gait parameters) provide mechanistic and clinical rationale for testing KH176 in related neuromuscular conditions (Janssen et al., 2019, pp. 1–2; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Preclinical data also support KH176’s efficacy: in mammalian models of mitochondrial dysfunction such as the Ndufs4−/− mouse model of Leigh disease, KH176 demonstrated improvements in motor performance, reductions in lipid peroxidation, and preservation of tissue microarchitecture—even though some endpoints, like lifespan extension, were not significantly altered (de Haas et al., 2017, pp. 2–3). To date, however, KH176 has not been directly studied in Friedreich’s Ataxia patients, though its mechanism and efficacy in analogous mitochondrial and neuromuscular diseases suggest a high potential for translational application in FA (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of KH176 is multifaceted, centering on its ability to modulate intracellular redox homeostasis. The primary active entity is not KH176 itself but its intracellularly produced metabolite, KH176m. KH176m exerts potent antioxidant effects by interacting with and activating the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin enzyme system, a critical endogenous antioxidant pathway that detoxifies peroxides and regulates redox signaling. Specifically, KH176m binds directly—according to in silico molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance studies—to peroxiredoxins such as Prdx2 and Prdx4, thereby enhancing their capacity to reduce hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides by accelerating NADPH consumption in the TrxR–Trx–Prdx cycle (Beyrath et al., 2018, pp. 10–11; Hankemeier & Smeitink, 2023, pp. 26–29). This selective interaction not only scavenges excessive ROS but also rebalances redox-sensitive signaling pathways that are dysregulated in mitochondrial diseases. In parallel, KH176m selectively inhibits microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), an enzyme downstream of cyclooxygenase activity responsible for catalyzing the formation of pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂). By reducing PGE₂ synthesis, KH176m exhibits anti-inflammatory effects without the broad prostaglandin suppression typically observed with classical NSAIDs, which is advantageous in mitigating side effects and preserving the production of cardioprotective prostanoids (Jiang, 2023, pp. 39–43; Smeitink et al., 2023, pp. 125–127). On the cellular level, the redox-modulating action of KH176 is associated with improvements in mitochondrial bioenergetics, evidenced by increased oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and potentially enhanced coupling efficiency of the electron transport chain. Although data specifically showing direct restoration of Complex I activity are limited, the overall decrease in oxidative stress is expected to mitigate secondary damage to Complex I and other respiratory chain components—a key consideration in diseases like Friedreich’s Ataxia where oxidative damage exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction (Liufu & Wang, 2021, pp. 5–7). Moreover, preclinical studies in disease models reveal that KH176 treatment correlates with reduced lipid peroxidation, decreased cellular ROS levels, and improved cell viability under oxidative stress conditions, thus underscoring its capability to restore mitochondrial function via redox modulation (Beyrath et al., 2018, pp. 6–7; de Haas et al., 2017, pp. 3–6).

Expected Effect:
Based on its well-characterized mechanism, the expected effect of KH176 in Friedreich’s Ataxia cells would be the reduction of mitochondrial ROS levels through targeted modulation of redox enzymes. In FRDA, one of the cardinal pathogenic features is the accumulation of mitochondrial oxidative damage resulting from frataxin deficiency, which disrupts iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis and ultimately impairs oxidative phosphorylation, particularly Complex I-driven electron transport. With KH176 reducing the burden of ROS (and particularly lipid peroxidation markers) by bolstering the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin system, it is anticipated that this compound would decrease redox stress and enable a partial restoration of normal Complex I activity and electron transport chain coupling. Preclinical models have shown that treatment with KH176 improves the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and reduces markers of oxidative damage; if similar effects are observed in FRDA cells, ATP production would likely increase, thus correcting one of the metabolic deficits observed in the disease (de Haas et al., 2017, pp. 2–3; Pitceathly et al., 2021, pp. 12–16). Moreover, the compound’s redox-modulating effect may also translate to improved cellular viability and function in tissues highly reliant on mitochondrial energy production, such as neurons and cardiomyocytes—cell types that are critically affected in Friedreich’s Ataxia (Liufu & Wang, 2021, pp. 3–5; Meng & Wu, 2023, pp. 3–5). From a molecular perspective, the restoration of redox balance is expected to normalize the expression and activity of key redox-sensitive proteins that regulate both mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics. Given that genes encoding components of the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin system are ubiquitously expressed and particularly enriched in metabolically active tissues, the intervention with KH176 is likely to produce measurable improvements in biochemical assays of mitochondrial function as well as downstream clinical endpoints such as gait performance and cognitive alertness (Janssen et al., 2019, pp. 5–7; Pitceathly et al., 2021, pp. 37–39). The hypothesis that KH176 will “restore Complex I activity and coupling efficiency” should be understood as an indirect effect: while KH176 may not directly upregulate Complex I enzyme activity, its reduction of ROS-mediated damage could allow Complex I to function more efficiently under conditions where the oxidative environment is less deleterious, thereby leading to increased ATP production (Jiang et al., 2021, p. 3).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, KH176 emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia. One of its primary strengths lies in its well-documented safety profile from early-phase human studies, where favorable pharmacokinetics and tolerability have been clearly demonstrated in healthy volunteers as well as in patients with other mitochondrial diseases (Koene et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). The compound’s mechanism of action, which centers on selective redox modulation via the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin system and selective inhibition of mPGES-1, provides a sound biochemical rationale for addressing the oxidative stress that is a core contributor to the pathology of FRDA (Beyrath et al., 2018, pp. 10–11; Hankemeier & Smeitink, 2023, pp. 26–29). Preclinical data lending support to this mechanism include robust evidence of reduced cellular ROS, normalization of mitochondrial oxidative damage markers, and preservation of tissue microstructure in models of Complex I deficiency (de Haas et al., 2017, pp. 2–3; Beyrath et al., 2018, pp. 6–7).

However, the weaknesses of KH176 for application in Friedreich’s Ataxia are also apparent. Despite encouraging preclinical findings and the compound’s clinical safety in related mitochondrial disorders, direct clinical data in FRDA patients is currently lacking. The KHENERGY study, while providing important insights into the compound’s effects in patients with m.3243A>G mutations, did not yield significant improvements in motor outcomes such as gait, although there were measurable improvements in mood and alertness (Janssen et al., 2019, pp. 1–2; Janssen et al., 2019, pp. 5–7). This highlights a potential disconnect between biochemical improvements and clinically meaningful functional outcomes, a gap that has also been observed with other redox modulators like idebenone in FRDA (Liufu & Wang, 2021, pp. 5–7). In addition, while the hypothesis posits that KH176 will restore Complex I activity and coupling efficiency, the evidence so far suggests that its effects are predominantly mediated by reduction of oxidative stress rather than direct modulation of ETC complex enzymatic function; thus, the anticipated improvement in ATP production might be modest at best or may require combination with other therapeutic modalities to achieve robust bioenergetic restoration (Jiang et al., 2021, p. 3; Pitceathly et al., 2021, pp. 44–47). Another consideration is that the redox system is complex and highly regulated, meaning that intervention via a single modulatory pathway might not be sufficient on its own to reverse the multifactorial mitochondrial dysfunction observed in Friedreich’s Ataxia. Furthermore, while early phase clinical trials have indicated an acceptable safety profile, the long-term effects and potential off-target consequences of chronic redox modulation remain to be elucidated in the context of FRDA (Koene et al., 2017, pp. 10–11).

Despite these concerns, the overall strengths of KH176—including its well-tolerated dosing regimen, favorable PK profile, ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, and a mechanism that directly intersects with the pathogenic oxidative stress observed in mitochondrial diseases—make it a highly attractive candidate for further evaluation in Friedreich’s Ataxia. The current body of literature provides a strong rationale for advancing KH176 into proof-of-concept studies in FRDA cell lines and possibly in early-phase clinical trials in FRDA patients. Importantly, its potential to improve not only biochemical markers of mitochondrial function but also clinical endpoints, such as improvements in cognitive function and potentially neuromuscular performance, aligns well with the unmet clinical needs in FRDA (Pitceathly et al., 2021, pp. 12–16; Meng & Wu, 2023, pp. 3–5).

In conclusion, KH176 represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate based on its robust preclinical evidence of redox modulation, favorable safety profile in Phase I human trials, and biochemical mechanism that is directly relevant to the pathophysiology of Friedreich’s Ataxia. However, while the candidate has clear strengths, such as its specific modulation of the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin system and its potential anti-inflammatory benefits via selective mPGES-1 inhibition, challenges remain regarding its ability to deliver sustained improvements in mitochondrial complex functionality and clinical outcomes in FRDA. The next logical steps would include more focused preclinical studies in FRDA-specific cellular models to document changes in OCR, ATP production, and Complex I activity after KH176 treatment, followed by carefully designed clinical trials in FRDA patients to confirm its efficacy on neuromuscular function and overall quality of life. Given the promising biochemical rationale and the advantages gleaned from its studies in other mitochondrial diseases, KH176 merits further exploration as part of the therapeutic arsenal against Friedreich’s Ataxia while also considering the possibility of combination therapies that might synergize its effects with agents targeting complementary aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Janssen et al., 2019, pp. 8–9).

Overall, the repurposing of KH176 for Friedreich’s Ataxia is conceptually well grounded, and careful follow-up studies could help bridge the gap between preclinical promise and clinically meaningful outcomes. The next phases of research should focus on establishing its impact on mitochondrial ATP production, verifying its efficacy in directly modulating Complex I-related parameters, and ultimately quantifying improvements in patient-reported outcomes and functional measures in FRDA cohorts. This strategic approach will provide the necessary data to validate whether KH176 can meaningfully modify disease progression in Friedreich’s Ataxia, thereby providing a new avenue for intervention in a disease area with significant unmet medical need (de Haas et al., 2017, pp. 6–7; Pitceathly et al., 2021, pp. 44–47).
