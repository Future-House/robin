Proposal for Metformin

Below is a detailed evaluation of metformin as a candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia, organized into the required sections.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Metformin is a synthetic agent from the biguanide class that was designed based on natural observations of the glucose‐lowering effects of compounds present in Galega officinalis. Early work identified that extracts from this plant, which contains the guanidine-derived molecule galegine, were associated with blood glucose reduction. However, because natural guanidines were associated with significant toxicity at therapeutic levels, medicinal chemists synthesized metformin as a dimethyl biguanide in order to combine efficacy with an improved safety profile (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 1–2). Unlike its natural precursor, galegine, metformin exhibits a stable biguanide structure that has been optimized to minimize lactic acidosis and other adverse effects that plagued earlier biguanide agents such as phenformin and buformin (Szymczak-Pajor et al., 2022, pp. 15–16). Chemically, metformin is manufactured by an organic synthetic route that involves the condensation of dimethylamine hydrochloride with cyanoguanidine under controlled conditions, resulting in the formation of the characteristic biguanide functional group (Lv & Guo, 2020, pp. 1–2). Today, metformin belongs to a large class of antidiabetic agents; it is widely prescribed as the first‐line therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) because of its robust antihyperglycemic properties, cost‐effectiveness, and extensive clinical safety record (Zuliani et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; Sportelli et al., 2020, pp. 2–3). In addition to its well‐documented use in T2DM, there is growing interest in repurposing metformin for other indications, including obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and also various neurodegenerative and mitochondrial diseases. Its ability to modulate cellular energetic balance and to affect mitochondrial function makes it a fitting candidate for diseases marked by mitochondrial dysfunction, such as Friedreich’s Ataxia.

Therapeutic History
The history of metformin in clinical medicine spans more than half a century. Initially introduced for diabetes management, metformin rapidly became the most commonly prescribed oral antidiabetic medication worldwide due to its efficacy in lowering blood glucose levels and its low risk of severe hypoglycemia (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 2–3; Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 1–3). In the decades since its introduction, thousands of clinical studies and extensive post-marketing surveillance have established its safety profile, with gastrointestinal disturbances being its most common side effect. Beyond its primary role in T2DM, metformin has been explored extensively in preclinical and clinical settings for its pleiotropic actions. For instance, studies have evaluated metformin’s potential beneficial effects in carcinoma through antiproliferative mechanisms, in cardiovascular disease through improved endothelial function and reduced oxidative stress, and in metabolic syndrome via improvements in insulin sensitivity (Lv & Guo, 2020, pp. 1–2; Du et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). Importantly, metformin’s modulatory effects on mitochondrial function have prompted investigations of its use in several neurodegenerative conditions. In Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease models, metformin has been shown to interact with pathways regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and cell survival (Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 19–20). Despite these numerous trials and experimental applications, a search of clinicaltrials.gov for “metformin Friedreich’s Ataxia” reveals no registered clinical studies specifically targeting Friedreich’s Ataxia with metformin (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nevertheless, the pathogenic features of Friedreich’s Ataxia—namely mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired energy metabolism—overlap significantly with the conditions in which metformin has demonstrated positive effects. This mechanistic overlap supports the ongoing exploration of metformin’s repurposing even in the absence of dedicated FRDA clinical trials (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 22–24; Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 19–20).

Mechanism of Action
Metformin’s pharmacological action is multifaceted, centering on its ability to modulate cellular energy metabolism at the mitochondrial level. The primary mechanism involves metformin’s mild, non-competitive inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory-chain complex I. This inhibition leads to a modest reduction in mitochondrial ATP production and, as a consequence, an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio. Such a shift in energy balance serves as a cellular signal for energy stress (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 3–5; Szymczak-Pajor et al., 2022, pp. 8–9). Cells respond to this elevated AMP/ATP ratio by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of energy homeostasis. Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates a host of downstream targets that inhibit anabolic processes while promoting catabolic pathways to restore energy balance; these targets include acetyl-CoA carboxylase and various transcription factors that regulate lipid and glucose metabolism (Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 3–4; Li et al., 2022, p. 13).

An essential mediator downstream of AMPK activation is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α), a transcriptional coactivator that serves as a “master regulator” of mitochondrial biogenesis. Activation of PGC-1α induces the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial replication, respiratory chain assembly, and antioxidant defense, thereby increasing mitochondrial quality and capacity (Rius-Pérez et al., 2020, p. 20). In addition to the canonical AMPK-dependent pathway, metformin also exerts effects via alternative, AMP-independent mechanisms. Recent studies have elucidated that metformin can interact with lysosomal proteins, such as presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), to activate AMPK via a lysosome-dependent pathway that does not require a change in the AMP/ATP ratio (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 5–8).

Furthermore, metformin’s action on mitochondrial complex I not only reduces ATP production but also alters the NADH/NAD⁺ ratio. This change in redox balance can directly influence the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under normal conditions, mitochondrial electron leakage from complex I is a significant source of ROS; by mildly inhibiting complex I, metformin potentially reduces this electron leakage and thereby diminishes ROS generation (Szymczak-Pajor et al., 2022, pp. 5–6; Li et al., 2022, pp. 7–8). This dual impact—simultaneous stimulation of compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis through AMPK/PGC-1α and reduction of oxidative stress through attenuated ROS production—is central to metformin’s broad metabolic and cytoprotective actions observed in numerous preclinical models.

Expected Effect in Friedreich’s Ataxia
Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) is a mitochondrial disorder that arises from deficiency of frataxin, a protein critical for iron-sulfur cluster assembly in mitochondria. This deficiency disrupts normal mitochondrial homeostasis, leading to impaired oxidative phosphorylation, increased ROS, and progressive neurodegeneration in affected tissues, particularly in the nervous system and the heart. The hypothesis behind repurposing metformin for FRDA is that low-dose metformin would exert a carefully balanced inhibition of complex I in FRDA cells. Such inhibition is expected to promote a modest reduction in ATP production that is sufficient to elevate the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio without precipitating a severe energy crisis—a delicate balance particularly crucial in cells already stressed by frataxin deficiency (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 22–24; Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 6–8).

This increase in AMP is anticipated to robustly activate AMPK, which then triggers a cascade of downstream events including the upregulation of PGC-1α. As PGC-1α is critical for mitochondrial biogenesis, its upregulation is predicted to drive the generation of new, functional mitochondria and the clearance of damaged ones via mitophagy. The overall effect should be an improvement in the quality of the mitochondrial pool in FRDA cells, better coupling of oxidative phosphorylation, and a reduction in the excessive ROS production that contributes to cellular damage (Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Li et al., 2022, pp. 7–8).

In preclinical studies using other neurodegenerative or mitochondrial disease models—including models of Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases—metformin has demonstrated the ability to restore mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and improve cellular bioenergetics (Du et al., 2022, pp. 3–5). In such models, the normalization of OCR correlates with improved neuronal viability and function, suggesting that similar benefits might also be observed in FRDA. The expectation in FRDA-specific assays, particularly those using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons, is that metformin treatment will lead to a measurable improvement in mitochondrial coupling efficiency, as evidenced by a restored balance between ATP generation and ROS production. Furthermore, given that frataxin is expressed in neuronal tissue where mitochondrial impairment is central to pathology, enhancing mitochondrial turnover through the AMPK/PGC-1α axis could directly counteract the bioenergetic deficiencies that underlie the progressive neurodegeneration observed in FRDA (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 22–24; Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).

Overall, if metformin’s dual mechanism—combining mild complex I inhibition with robust AMPK activation—can be titrated precisely in FRDA cells, it is expected that this will trigger compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis and mitigate the excessive oxidative stress that contributes to the ataxic phenotype. Such normalization of mitochondrial function would theoretically improve cellular survival, neuronal function, and ultimately slow the progression of neurodegeneration characteristic of Friedreich’s Ataxia.

Overall Evaluation
Metformin possesses considerable promise as a candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia. One of its strongest assets is its extensive clinical history in type 2 diabetes mellitus. With decades of data affirming its safety, well-known pharmacokinetics, and cost-effectiveness, metformin minimizes many of the risks associated with new drug development. Its robust record as an antidiabetic agent provides a significant translational advantage because the dosing, tissue distribution, and adverse event profile are well characterized (Zuliani et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; Sportelli et al., 2020, pp. 2–3).

From a mechanistic perspective, metformin directly addresses several pathological aspects of Friedreich’s Ataxia. The disease is characterized by impaired mitochondrial function stemming from frataxin deficiency, which leads to both a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation efficiency and an increase in ROS production. Metformin’s principal mechanism of moderately inhibiting complex I and elevating the AMP/ATP ratio can trigger AMPK-dependent signaling cascades that facilitate mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover through the upregulation of PGC-1α (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 3–5; Rius-Pérez et al., 2020, p. 20). This, in turn, promises to improve mitochondrial quality and reduce the damaging burden of oxidative stress—a central pathological mechanism in FRDA (Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Li et al., 2022, pp. 7–8).

Despite these attractive features, several noteworthy challenges must be considered. First, while the preclinical data for metformin’s action on mitochondrial metabolism are extensive in models of diabetes and neurodegeneration (e.g., Parkinson’s and Huntington’s), direct evidence for its efficacy in Friedreich’s Ataxia models is currently lacking. A search of clinical trial databases indicates no registered studies examining metformin specifically in FRDA (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The unique mitochondrial stress already present in frataxin-deficient neurons may render them particularly sensitive to further inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, dosing will need to be very carefully optimized; too high a dose might exacerbate energy deficits, while too low a dose may not sufficiently trigger the compensatory mechanisms needed to enhance mitochondrial quality (Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Li et al., 2022, pp. 7–8).

Another challenge lies in the complexity of AMPK signaling in neuronal cells. Although AMPK activation has consistently been associated with beneficial effects in many cell types, the downstream responses in neurons—especially in a disease context like FRDA that is characterized by profound mitochondrial impairment—might differ from those observed in hepatocytes or muscle cells. Neuronal metabolic responses are inherently more fragile; thus, the heterogeneity in AMPK activation and its potential off-target effects might result in variable responses that complicate dose titration. Moreover, while alternative AMP-independent mechanisms (such as those mediated by PEN2 at the lysosomal membrane) have been described, it remains unclear whether these pathways are fully functional in the neuronal contexts relevant to FRDA (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 5–8).

A further point of consideration is that while metformin does reduce ROS production by attenuating mitochondrial electron leakage, persistent mild inhibition of complex I might limit overall ATP production in cells that are already energetically compromised by frataxin deficiency. In such a scenario, even if AMPK is activated and mitochondrial biogenesis occurs, the net energy output may not be sufficient to reverse the bioenergetic deficit. Thus, extensive preclinical studies in FRDA-specific models—such as frataxin-deficient iPSC-derived neurons or animal models that recapitulate the mitochondrial dysfunction seen in FRDA—will be essential to define the therapeutic window (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 22–24; Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 6–8).

On the other hand, the wealth of data supporting metformin’s impact on energy metabolism and redox homeostasis significantly strengthens its candidacy. Several studies conducted in diverse biological systems have demonstrated that metformin’s modulation of the NADH/NAD⁺ ratio and its effects on mitochondrial coupling correlate with improved cellular function and survival. For example, in preclinical models of neurodegeneration, metformin’s ability to restore oxygen consumption rates and reduce oxidative stress has been linked with neuroprotection and improved motor function (Du et al., 2022, pp. 3–5). Although these models are not identical to Friedreich’s Ataxia, they underscore the potential for metformin to correct energetic deficits in cells under mitochondrial stress. In FRDA, where defective iron-sulfur cluster formation compromises multiple enzymatic systems of the mitochondria, the possibility that metformin could favorably reprogram cellular energy metabolism is particularly appealing.

It is also important to emphasize that metformin’s extensive clinical use implies that many aspects of its pharmacokinetics and tolerability are well understood. This alone could facilitate a rapid transition from preclinical validation to clinical trials, provided that further studies confirm that a carefully titrated dose can trigger the desired compensatory responses in FRDA cells without imposing undue energetic stress. The prospect of repurposing an already approved and inexpensive drug is highly attractive in the context of a rare disease such as Friedreich’s Ataxia, where the cost and risk associated with novel drug development are significant barriers (Zuliani et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; Sportelli et al., 2020, pp. 2–3).

In conclusion, metformin exhibits substantial promise as a therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on its well-characterized safety profile, long history of clinical use, and multifaceted action on mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis. Its ability to induce a mild inhibition of mitochondrial complex I and thereby activate AMPK—with subsequent upregulation of PGC-1α and promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis—directly targets key pathomechanisms underlying FRDA. These include the oxidative stress and bioenergetic failure that arise from frataxin deficiency. While the clinical evidence for metformin in Friedreich’s Ataxia is currently indirect—largely inferred from its efficacy in other neurodegenerative and mitochondrial conditions—there is robust biochemical and preclinical support for its further investigation in this setting (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 3–5; Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Li et al., 2022, pp. 7–8).

The main challenges reside in determining the optimal dose that is capable of eliciting beneficial AMPK-mediated compensatory mechanisms without exacerbating the energy deficiency already present in frataxin-deficient neurons. Moreover, cell type–specific differences in AMPK signaling and mitochondrial dynamics necessitate comprehensive studies using FRDA models. In light of these considerations, systematic preclinical evaluation using FRDA-specific cellular and animal models is imperative. Such studies should focus on the dose-response relationship of metformin in neuronal tissues, quantify improvements in oxygen consumption rates, monitor mitochondrial coupling efficiency, and measure reductions in ROS production. Only with these rigorous validations can metformin ultimately be considered a viable therapeutic option for FRDA.

Overall, metformin’s theoretical benefits—including improvements in mitochondrial biogenesis, enhanced antioxidant defenses, and the rebalancing of cellular bioenergetics—make it an appealing repurposing candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its extensive clinical background provides significant advantages in terms of known pharmacokinetics, safety, and potential for rapid regulatory approval compared with entirely novel drugs. However, the translation of metformin’s known effects in diabetes and other neurodegenerative models into a meaningful treatment for FRDA will depend on careful dose optimization and comprehensive preclinical studies to ensure that its mitochondrial inhibitory effects do not inadvertently worsen the energy deficit in vulnerable neuronal cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 16–17). If these hurdles can be overcome, metformin could offer a new avenue for mitigating the neurodegenerative progression observed in Friedreich’s Ataxia, representing an exciting opportunity for repurposing a well-known drug to address a critical unmet need in mitochondrial disease therapy.

In summary, the major strengths of metformin include its well-documented safety profile over decades of clinical use, its low cost and wide availability, and its multifaceted mechanism of action that directly addresses key pathological features of FRDA—namely mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired energy metabolism, and ROS overproduction. The weaknesses lie primarily in the currently unproven efficacy of metformin in FRDA-specific models and the challenges inherent in fine-tuning a therapeutic window that balances energy stress and compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis in already compromised neurons. Given these considerations, metformin warrants continued investigation in rigorous preclinical studies dedicated to the Friedreich’s Ataxia model before moving into clinical trials. Such work is justified by the mechanistic plausibility and extensive safety experience with the drug, making it a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 22–24; Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Li et al., 2022, pp. 7–8).
