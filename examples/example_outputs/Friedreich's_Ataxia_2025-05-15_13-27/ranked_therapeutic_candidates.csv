Deferiprone (Ferriprox),"Proposal for Deferiprone (Ferriprox)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Deferiprone (also known as Ferriprox or L1) is a synthetic, orally active iron chelator belonging to the 3‐hydroxypyridin-4‐one class, originally developed to treat systemic iron overload conditions such as thalassemia major. It was discovered and later synthesized as a low-molecular-weight, bidentate compound capable of effectively binding ferric iron via its two donor atoms, forming a stable 3:1 complex with iron (Chaston & Richardson, 2003). The compound’s chemical structure confers lipophilicity that enables it to cross cellular membranes easily, including the mitochondrial membranes, which is central to its repurposing for diseases characterized by intracellular and mitochondrial iron accumulation (Nuñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018; Kontoghiorghes, 2022). In summary, deferiprone is a synthetic hydroxypyridinone derivative that has been optimized for oral administration and effective chelation of redox-active iron, thereby placing it in a unique class of compounds that have traditionally been used to reduce iron burden in transfusion-dependent patients.

Therapeutic History:
Since its introduction for the management of transfusional siderosis in conditions such as thalassemia major, deferiprone has accumulated extensive clinical experience confirming its long-term safety and efficacy in reducing systemic iron overload (Chaston & Richardson, 2003). Its use in iron overload conditions provided the foundational evidence for repurposing it in diseases involving focal intracellular and mitochondrial iron accumulation. In the specific context of Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA), clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008, 2009; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) have investigated its potential to reduce cardiac iron load and ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction in affected FRDA patients (Kontoghiorghes, 2022). Furthermore, preclinical models and mechanistic studies in neurodegenerative conditions have lent further support by demonstrating that deferiprone can lower mitochondrial iron levels, thereby mitigating oxidative damage—a hallmark shared by FRDA and iron overload disorders (Goncalves et al., 2008; Isaya, 2014). Collectively, these studies underscore a therapeutic history where deferiprone has not only been well characterized for iron overload but is also now being validated in diseases with mitochondrial iron dysregulation such as FRDA.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, deferiprone functions via a well-established mechanism of iron chelation. Its two donor atoms coordinate with ferric iron (Fe3+) in a bidentate fashion to form a 3:1 (ligand:iron) complex, which is subsequently excreted primarily via the urine. This mechanism is critical for depleting labile iron pools that catalyze the Fenton reaction, a process responsible for generating highly reactive hydroxyl radicals, thereby reducing oxidative stress (Chaston & Richardson, 2003). Notably, because deferiprone is small and lipophilic, it is able to cross cellular and mitochondrial membranes, allowing it to directly target the mitochondrial labile iron pool. Excess mitochondrial iron contributes to the impairment of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster–containing enzymes—such as aconitase—which are essential for mitochondrial respiration and energy production; by chelating this iron, deferiprone is hypothesized to preserve the activity of these key enzymes (Goncalves et al., 2008; Vaubel & Isaya, 2013). Additionally, the antioxidant benefits conferred by this chelation are twofold: reducing the pool of catalytic iron required for Fenton chemistry and minimizing subsequent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These combined actions can lead to improvements in mitochondrial bioenergetics and cellular survival in tissues most affected in FRDA, such as cardiomyocytes and neurons (Nuñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018; Devos et al., 2014). The molecular interactions of deferiprone have been characterized across both in vitro biochemical studies and relevant in vivo models, further establishing its mechanism in reducing oxidative damage by modulating mitochondrial iron homeostasis.

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving deferiprone’s repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia is that by chelating excess mitochondrial labile iron, the drug will reduce iron-catalyzed Fenton reactions and associated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This reduction in oxidative stress is expected to preserve the functionality of Fe-S cluster enzymes, such as aconitase, thereby maintaining effective mitochondrial respiration and energy production in FRDA cardiomyocytes and neurons (Goncalves et al., 2008; Isaya, 2014). In a proposed assay setting, one would anticipate finding normalization of both biochemical and mitochondrial biomarkers, including restored activities of enzymes that depend on intact Fe-S clusters, reduced lipid peroxidation products, and overall improved mitochondrial respiration as determined by oxygen consumption measurements (Nuñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018; Vaubel & Isaya, 2013). Moreover, previous clinical data indicate that treatment with deferiprone may yield improvements in cardiac parameters such as reduced left ventricular mass index, which is particularly significant given the high prevalence of cardiomyopathy in FRDA patients (Kruger et al., 2016). In neuronal cells, the expected effect includes reduced markers of oxidative stress and improved cell viability, potentially translating into slowing the progression of ataxic symptoms as measured by established clinical rating scales (Jain et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Deferiprone presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia, particularly due to its ability to target a key pathogenic driver—excess mitochondrial iron resulting in oxidative damage and impaired Fe-S cluster synthesis. Among its strengths is its oral bioavailability and capacity to cross mitochondrial membranes, which differentiates it from larger or poorly absorbed chelators such as desferrioxamine (Chaston & Richardson, 2003; Nuñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018). Its long history of safety and efficacy in managing systemic iron overload further supports its translational potential (Kontoghiorghes, 2022). Mechanistically, the drug capitalizes on reducing the labile iron pool within mitochondria—thereby diminishing ROS production and protecting Fe-S cluster enzymes—which is directly aligned with the molecular pathology observed in FRDA (Goncalves et al., 2008; Vaubel & Isaya, 2013). Studies in preclinical models, as well as early-phase clinical trials identified by ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008, 2009), provide a mechanistic rationale and preliminary evidence suggesting benefits in reducing cardiac iron overload and potentially improving mitochondrial function.

Notwithstanding these strengths, some weaknesses merit consideration. Although deferiprone has demonstrated efficacy in reducing iron deposition, the balance between effective iron chelation and the risk of inducing systemic iron deficiency remains a challenge, particularly given that iron is essential for numerous biological processes (Mounsey & Teismann, 2012). Moreover, clinical responses to deferiprone in FRDA have been variable, with some studies reporting limited neurological improvement—a likely reflection of disease heterogeneity and the possibility that iron accumulation represents a secondary rather than primary defect (Martelli & Puccio, 2014; Chiabrando et al., 2020). Additionally, side effects such as transient neutropenia and agranulocytosis, albeit rare and manageable with careful monitoring, must be factored into the overall risk–benefit assessment (Kontoghiorghes, 2022; Devos et al., 2014). Finally, while the mechanistic foundation is robust, further well-powered, randomized controlled trials are required to definitively confirm that deferiprone’s chelation of mitochondrial iron translates into meaningful, long-term clinical benefits for FRDA patients (Rummey et al., 2018; Jain et al., 2022).

In conclusion, the comprehensive literature review supports deferiprone as a mechanistically rational and promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its ability to chelate excess mitochondrial iron, reduce Fenton-driven ROS production, and preserve Fe-S cluster enzyme function directly addresses core aspects of FRDA pathology. The compound’s oral bioavailability, mitochondrial penetration, and established safety profile in iron overload therapy are significant strengths that lend credence to its repurposing for FRDA (Chaston & Richardson, 2003; Kontoghiorghes, 2022; Nuñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018). However, gaps remain regarding optimal dosing to avoid systemic iron depletion and the need for further robust clinical evidence specifically in FRDA populations (Kruger et al., 2016; Martelli & Puccio, 2014). Overall, while additional clinical trials are essential to fully define its efficacy and long-term safety in FRDA patients, deferiprone’s favorable pharmacological profile and targeted mechanism of reducing mitochondrial iron overload make it a highly promising candidate worthy of continued development in the treatment of Friedreich’s Ataxia.

Omaveloxolone (RTA 408),"Proposal for Omaveloxolone (RTA 408)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Omaveloxolone, also known as RTA 408, is a semisynthetic triterpenoid originally developed from oleanolic acid derivatives and engineered to enhance intrinsic antioxidant defenses. This compound belongs to the class of synthetic triterpenoids that have been extensively studied for their anti‐inflammatory, anticancer, and antioxidative properties. Semisynthetic triterpenoids are produced by chemically modifying natural triterpenoid leads to improve potency, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetic properties. Omaveloxolone in particular was discovered based on its ability to bind to and neutralize Keap1, the protein that under normal conditions suppresses the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) by targeting it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. As a member of this therapeutic class, omaveloxolone has been applied in several studies aimed at mitigating oxidative stress, and its chemical design leverages established structure–activity relationships seen in triterpenoids that modulate redox biology (Clay et al., 2019, pp. 1–3). Historically, similar compounds have been employed in preclinical oncology and inflammatory disease models, and more recently omaveloxolone has been repurposed for Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) owing to its potent activation of Nrf2 signaling, with significant implications for diseases marked by mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress (Scott et al., 2024, pp. 1–2).

Therapeutic History:
Omaveloxolone has been evaluated in multiple preclinical studies and clinical trials, particularly in the context of diseases where oxidative damage plays a central role. Preclinical data have shown that omaveloxolone upregulates Nrf2 target genes, thereby enhancing defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and improving mitochondrial oxidative capacity in models of FRDA (Lynch et al., 2019, pp. 1–2; Rodríguez et al., 2020, pp. 3–4). Early-phase clinical trials, including phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers, have detailed its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, and phase 2 trials (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015) demonstrated safety and dose-dependent transcriptional upregulation of antioxidant genes in FRDA patients (Lynch et al., 2021, pp. 1–2). Although not used historically in veterinary practice, omaveloxolone’s therapeutic class has been linked to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory interventions. Importantly, omaveloxolone has been investigated specifically for Friedreich’s Ataxia—a genetic neurodegenerative disease characterized by frataxin deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction—and it is the first agent in its class to be approved in this indication for patients aged 16 years and older (Scott et al., 2024, pp. 5–6; Clay et al., 2019, pp. 3–4). Multiple studies, both preclinical and clinical, have also examined its efficacy in neuronal models, including patient-derived fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons, demonstrating improved mitochondrial respiration and reduced oxidative damage (Tiberi et al., 2023, pp. 7–8; Rodríguez et al., 2020, pp. 8–10).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of omaveloxolone centers on its ability to activate the transcription factor Nrf2. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm via its binding partner Keap1, which facilitates its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Omaveloxolone works by binding directly to Keap1—specifically interacting with critical cysteine residues such as Cys151—thereby preventing Nrf2 sequestration (Tiberi et al., 2023, pp. 15–16; La Rosa et al., 2020b, pp. 10–12). This disruption releases Nrf2 from Keap1, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus where it heterodimerizes with small Maf proteins, binding to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of target genes. Activation of Nrf2 results in the transcriptional upregulation of a battery of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes, including but not limited to NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutases (SODs), and enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis (Strawser et al., 2017, pp. 10–13; La Rosa et al., 2020b, pp. 10–12). This cascade of antioxidant gene expression confers cellular protection against ROS and has been implicated in the restoration of mitochondrial respiratory capacity by indirectly reducing oxidative damage to iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters. In the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, where frataxin deficiency leads to impaired Fe-S cluster biogenesis and resultant mitochondrial dysfunction, omaveloxolone’s mechanism offers a twofold benefit: it attenuates oxidative stress through enhanced antioxidant defenses and may promote an environment conducive to improved mitochondrial bioenergetics and possibly even a modest increase in frataxin expression via indirect regulatory effects on the FXN gene (Tai et al., 2018, pp. 3–4; Lynch et al., 2021, pp. 13–14). Preclinical studies in FRDA patient-derived iPSC neurons have shown that treatment with omaveloxolone increases oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and mitochondrial function, which supports its proposed mechanism of reversing mitochondrial impairment (Tiberi et al., 2023, pp. 16–18).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis and preclinical data, omaveloxolone is expected to activate the Nrf2 pathway in FRDA patient-derived fibroblasts and neurons, leading to the upregulation of antioxidant genes that combat excessive ROS production and oxidative damage. In the proposed assays, one would expect to observe increased expression of Nrf2 target genes such as HO-1, NQO1, and genes involved in glutathione synthesis, which collectively contribute to improved cellular redox homeostasis (Rodríguez et al., 2020, pp. 4–5). This upregulation should, in turn, protect and restore mitochondrial function by minimizing oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA and Fe-S cluster-containing enzymes, thereby improving the respiratory capacity of affected cells (Tiberi et al., 2023, pp. 7–8; Scott et al., 2024, pp. 3–5). Moreover, although direct upregulation of frataxin by omaveloxolone has not been consistently demonstrated, the enhanced antioxidant response can indirectly alleviate the oxidative stress that exacerbates frataxin deficiency, potentially normalizing some aspects of Fe-S cluster assembly and mitochondrial bioenergetics (Clay et al., 2019, pp. 13–14; Lynch et al., 2019, pp. 11–12). In assays using FRDA fibroblasts and neurons, one could measure parameters such as decreased ROS levels, improved mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ATP production, and better oxygen consumption rates (Tiberi et al., 2023, pp. 20–22; Rodríguez et al., 2020, pp. 8–10). The presence and function of Nrf2 in these cell types are well documented, and previous studies have confirmed that the Nrf2 pathway is downregulated in FRDA, supporting the assay’s rationale (Rodríguez et al., 2020, pp. 22–24; La Rosa et al., 2020a, pp. 3–5).

Overall Evaluation:
Omaveloxolone appears to be a highly promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on both its mechanism of action and the preclinical/clinical evidence available. Strengths of this candidate include its specific mechanism of action—targeting the Nrf2 pathway through direct Keap1 binding—which addresses a core pathological feature of FRDA by restoring the antioxidant capacity and improving mitochondrial function (Tiberi et al., 2023, pp. 15–16; Scott et al., 2024, pp. 10–11). The compound’s extensive preclinical characterization in FRDA models, including evidence from patient-derived fibroblast studies and iPSC-derived neurons, provides reassurance about its potential to reverse oxidative damage and improve cellular respiration (Lynch et al., 2019, pp. 1–2; Tai et al., 2018, pp. 2–3). Additionally, robust clinical data from phase 2 studies indicate that omaveloxolone is safe and well tolerated in FRDA patients, with clear dose-dependent transcriptional upregulation of Nrf2-driven genes, which supports its translational potential (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; Lynch et al., 2021, pp. 1–2).

However, there are some limitations to consider. While the indirect increase in frataxin expression is appealing, the current literature suggests that omaveloxolone does not directly modulate FXN expression but instead works by mitigating downstream oxidative stress consequences, which may limit the extent of clinical benefit if frataxin deficiency remains severe (Clay et al., 2019, pp. 3–4; Rodríguez et al., 2020, pp. 3–4). Moreover, the heterogeneity in patient responses, as observed in clinical trials, and potential issues relating to achieving optimal dosing in specific subpopulations (such as pediatric versus adult patients) remain challenges that require further investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024a; Scott et al., 2024, pp. 3–5). There is also the need to closely monitor for off-target effects and toxicity, particularly in long-term use, given that triterpenoids have been associated with relatively complex safety profiles in some contexts (Lynch et al., 2019, pp. 11–12; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024b). Nonetheless, the availability of detailed clinical-stage PK/ADME data and established safety profiles through multiple phase 1 and 2 studies positions omaveloxolone for rapid development and potential regulatory approval (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024c).

In summary, omaveloxolone’s ability to activate Nrf2 and thereby upregulate antioxidant defenses addresses key pathological drivers in Friedreich’s Ataxia, namely oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction due to frataxin deficiency. Its extensive preclinical validation in patient-derived models combined with encouraging clinical trial data support its further development as a disease-modifying therapy for FRDA (Strawser et al., 2017, pp. 30–33; Subramony & Lynch, 2024, pp. 1–2). While additional studies are necessary to optimize dosing and provide long-term efficacy and safety insights, the strengths of omaveloxolone—in terms of target specificity, mechanistic rationale, and robust early-phase data—strongly endorse its consideration as a therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia (Tiberi et al., 2023, pp. 1–2; Clay et al., 2019, pp. 1–3).

EPI-743 (Vatiquinone),"Proposal for EPI-743 (Vatiquinone)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
EPI-743 (Vatiquinone) is a para‐benzoquinone derivative that was originally developed as a potent antioxidant designed to target mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Chemically, it is a synthetic compound related to vitamin E derivatives and coenzyme Q10 analogues. It was discovered through efforts to develop small‐molecule therapeutics that could restore redox balance by modulating key oxidoreductases. As a member of the quinone class, EPI-743 is designed to enhance the activity of NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), which is an enzyme critically involved in cellular redox cycling and the regeneration of endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione. This class of compounds has previously been used in various mitochondrial and oxidative stress–related disorders, where the emphasis has been on improving mitochondrial electron transport chain function and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. The synthetic origins of EPI-743 involved chemical modifications designed to optimize its bioavailability and ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, which is a major consideration in neurodegenerative diseases such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) (Edzeamey et al., 2024; Lew et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
EPI-743 has a significant track record in the clinical investigation of mitochondrial diseases, having undergone several phase 2 trials in conditions characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, including mitochondrial encephalopathies and other neurodegenerative diseases. In clinical trials with Friedreich’s Ataxia patients, it has been administered in randomized, placebo-controlled studies where the primary goal was to improve visual and neurological functions. Notably, one of the pivotal studies, identified under ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01728064, assessed its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and effects on visual and motor outcomes in FRDA patients (PTC Therapeutics, 2012). Preclinical studies in FRDA fibroblasts and patient-derived cell models have demonstrated that EPI-743 improves mitochondrial respiration, restores glutathione (GSH) levels, and normalizes complex I-dependent ATP production. Its safety profile in these studies has been favorable, with acceptable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties noted in multiple trials (Jain et al., 2022; Edzeamey et al., 2024). Furthermore, the candidate has been repurposed from earlier uses in similar mitochondrial disorders to target the oxidative pathology in FRDA, where oxidative stress is a critical component of disease progression.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, EPI-743 functions predominantly as a cofactor for NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). This enzyme facilitates the two-electron reduction of quinones, a process that is essential for preventing redox cycling and the formation of harmful semiquinone radicals. By serving as a cofactor, EPI-743 enhances NQO1 activity, thereby promoting the regeneration of reduced glutathione (GSH) – the cell's primary antioxidant molecule. Increased levels of GSH result in improved removal of ROS and a concomitant reduction in oxidative damage, particularly in mitochondria where complex I is critically affected in Friedreich’s Ataxia (Petrillo et al., 2019; Suárez-Rivero et al., 2021).

Furthermore, EPI-743 has been shown in preclinical settings to improve mitochondrial complex I respiration. In FRDA, frataxin deficiency leads to impaired iron–sulfur cluster formation, which compromises complex I activity and overall mitochondrial bioenergetics. Through its antioxidant properties, EPI-743 not only reduces the burden of ROS but also contributes to the stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential and electron transport efficiency. The compound’s activity on NQO1 also intersects with the Nrf2 pathway, a key regulator of the cellular antioxidant response, suggesting that EPI-743 may indirectly contribute to the upregulation of additional antioxidant genes and enzymes (Petrillo et al., 2019; Edzeamey et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for the use of EPI-743 in FRDA is that its cofactor activity will boost NQO1 function in patient-derived cells, leading to enhanced glutathione regeneration. As a result, one can expect a reduction in oxidative stress markers and improved mitochondrial bioenergetics. Specifically, in cellular assays using FRDA fibroblasts, treatment with EPI-743 is expected to restore depleted GSH levels and reduce ROS-induced damage, thereby normalizing the maximal respiration rates and oxygen consumption rates (OCR) that are typically impaired due to frataxin deficiency. The compound's mechanism of modulating the redox state is directly supported by data showing improved cellular OCR and ATP production after EPI-743 administration (University of South Florida, 2013; Edzeamey et al., 2024). Furthermore, given that complex I-driven respiration is pivotal for mitochondrial ATP synthesis—and that this process is compromised in FRDA—the anticipated effect of EPI-743 is an improvement in complex I function, resulting in enhanced energy production. Expression of NQO1, along with other redox-sensitive proteins, has been documented in FRDA patient-derived cells, underscoring the relevance of targeting this pathway in this cell type (Jain et al., 2022; Lew et al., 2022). Ultimately, the normalization of mitochondrial function is expected to translate into beneficial clinical outcomes, including improved neurological function and potential slowing or partial reversal of disease progression.

Overall Evaluation:
EPI-743 represents a promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia, with several strengths that support its potential utility in the disease. First, its mechanism of action is well-grounded in the pathology of FRDA—the enhancement of NQO1-mediated glutathione regeneration directly addresses the oxidative stress that underpins mitochondrial dysfunction in this disorder (Petrillo et al., 2019; Edzeamey et al., 2024). The compound’s ability to improve mitochondrial complex I respiration is particularly relevant given that deficits in complex I activity are a hallmark of FRDA. Second, the clinical data from mitochondrial disease studies have demonstrated a favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile for EPI-743, coupled with evidence of mitochondrial uptake and activity in patient-derived cells, which further strengthens its candidacy for FRDA (Zesiewicz et al., 2018; PTC Therapeutics, 2022).

Moreover, the extensive preclinical studies showing restoration of cellular antioxidant capacity, reduction of ROS, and normalization of mitochondrial function provide a robust biochemical rationale for its use (Edzeamey et al., 2024; Jain et al., 2022). The consistency of these findings across both in vitro and early-phase clinical trials suggests that EPI-743 could potentially modify disease pathology rather than merely providing symptomatic relief, making it a strong candidate for disease-modifying therapy in FRDA.

However, there are also potential weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. While the preclinical data are compelling, clinical efficacy in FRDA specifically remains to be conclusively demonstrated in larger, controlled trials. Many early-phase studies have focused on mitochondrial disorders in general, and the heterogeneity of FRDA pathophysiology could complicate interpretation of clinical outcomes. Additionally, the variable expression of biomarkers such as NQO1 and differences in patient genotype or disease stage may affect responsiveness to treatment, necessitating well-designed stratification strategies in clinical trials (Jain et al., 2022; Lew et al., 2022). Another consideration is that while EPI-743 has an excellent safety profile so far, long-term effects and the impact on disease progression over many years remain to be fully elucidated.

In summary, EPI-743 (Vatiquinone) stands out as a therapeutically promising candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia due to its dual ability to boost cellular antioxidant defenses via NQO1 activation and to improve mitochondrial complex I respiration. Its synthetic origins as a para-benzoquinone, combined with a well-documented safety profile and favorable ADME properties, render it a strong candidate for repurposing in FRDA. Although challenges remain in definitively establishing long-term efficacy and determining the optimal patient population, the cumulative biochemical, preclinical, and early clinical evidence provides a compelling rationale for advancing EPI-743 in the treatment of FRDA (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; PTC Therapeutics, 2012; Edzeamey et al., 2024; Zesiewicz et al., 2018). Continued investigation in well-powered, placebo-controlled trials with integrated biomarker studies will be essential to confirm its disease-modifying potential and to inform optimal dosing strategies for patients with this challenging neurodegenerative disorder.

Leriglitazone,"Proposal for Leriglitazone

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Leriglitazone is a fully synthetic small‐molecule drug originally developed as a derivative within the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class, a family of compounds historically used as insulin sensitizers for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its specific design involves modifications of the parent compound pioglitazone, and it represents the active metabolite M4 in its hydrochloride form. This molecule was optimized to overcome limitations inherent to older glitazones, particularly their suboptimal brain penetration. Leriglitazone’s enhanced blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability sets it apart from conventional PPARγ agonists and renders it suitable for indications with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Belonging to the class of synthetic PPARγ agonists, it modulates transcriptional programs by binding the nuclear receptor PPARγ. This receptor is known to control gene expression programs involved in lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, inflammation, and, critically, mitochondrial biogenesis via activation of downstream coactivators like PGC-1α. In summary, leriglitazone is a rationally designed synthetic agent engineered to achieve high CNS bioavailability while harnessing the known therapeutic properties of TZDs, making it a promising candidate for repurposing in neurodegenerative disorders such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (Edzeamey et al., 2024; Pizcueta et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Thiazolidinediones historically have been used for metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes due to their insulin-sensitizing properties; however, conventional agents such as pioglitazone have also been studied for off-label neuroprotective effects because of their ability to modulate mitochondrial function and anti-inflammatory pathways. Leriglitazone, as a next‐generation PPARγ agonist, has demonstrated promising preclinical and early clinical evidence in several neurodegenerative disorders. Its clinical development has notably included studies in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), where its effectiveness was linked to its ability to attain therapeutic CNS concentrations while maintaining a favorable safety profile. In the context of FRDA—a disorder characterized by a deficiency of the mitochondrial protein frataxin that leads to impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics, iron dysregulation, and oxidative stress—early in vitro studies using FRDA fibroblasts have observed increases in frataxin protein upon treatment with leriglitazone. Moreover, clinical trial evidence in FRDA (e.g., study NCT03917225; Minoryx Therapeutics, S.L., 2019) has focused on imaging and biomarker endpoints, showing that the drug is capable of modifying disease-relevant parameters such as spinal cord morphology and markers of neuronal integrity, even though definitive efficacy outcomes are still emerging. While leriglitazone itself has not yet been approved for FRDA, the prior therapeutic history of its drug class and the encouraging biochemical and bioenergetic signals documented in FRDA models underscore its potential repurposing for this neurodegenerative condition (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Edzeamey et al., 2024; Pandolfo et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
Leriglitazone’s mechanism centers on its high-affinity binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that modulates gene transcription upon activation. Binding of leriglitazone to PPARγ results in a conformational change that facilitates dissociation of corepressors and recruitment of coactivators, notably including PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha). PGC-1α plays a pivotal role as the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation by coactivating a host of transcription factors that upregulate genes required for the synthesis and maintenance of mitochondrial proteins and respiratory chain complexes. In the context of FRDA, increased PGC-1α activity is expected to drive the formation of new mitochondria and enhance the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, thereby counteracting the bioenergetic deficits that arise from frataxin deficiency. Furthermore, evidence suggests that leriglitazone can indirectly stabilize frataxin protein levels. Although the precise molecular interactions that lead to frataxin stabilization remain to be entirely delineated, activation of the PPARγ-PGC-1α axis is proposed to upregulate mitochondrial chaperones such as GRP75 (glucose-regulated protein 75). GRP75 is essential for mitochondrial protein import and quality control, and its increased expression may help maintain proper frataxin folding and stability. By enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and reducing oxidative stress, leriglitazone also contributes to restoring mitochondrial membrane potential and normalizing intracellular calcium homeostasis, processes that are typically disrupted in FRDA models. The combined effect of these mechanisms—selective PPARγ activation, PGC-1α–driven mitochondrial biogenesis, upregulation of chaperones like GRP75, and stabilization of frataxin—constitutes the primary biochemical rationale for using leriglitazone to restore mitochondrial function and mitigate neurodegeneration in FRDA (Pandolfo et al., 2022; Pizcueta et al., 2023; Rodríguez-Pascau et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis under evaluation is that leriglitazone will selectively modulate PPARγ in FRDA iPSC-derived neurons, leading to a cascade of beneficial transcriptional events. In such a system, one would expect leriglitazone to robustly activate PPARγ, which then increases transcriptional output of PGC-1α. As PGC-1α levels rise, this should drive mitochondrial biogenesis and boost the expression of genes critical for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function. A direct downstream effect anticipated from this activation is the upregulation of mitochondrial chaperones such as GRP75, which facilitates the proper processing and stability of frataxin, the protein scarce in FRDA pathology. As frataxin levels become stabilized, the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters necessary for electron transport chain integrity can be improved, thereby restoring normal oxidative phosphorylation. Preclinical findings in FRDA fibroblasts have already shown that treatment with leriglitazone results in increased frataxin protein levels and improved bioenergetic profiles, suggesting that similar effects may be recapitulated in iPSC-derived neuronal models. In these neuronal assays, one would expect enhanced mitochondrial coupling efficiency, reduced production of reactive oxygen species, and decreased signs of mitochondrial stress. Given that neurons in FRDA patients suffer from impaired mitochondrial metabolism leading to neurodegeneration, the restoration of these pathways is likely to translate into improved neuronal survival, enhanced neurite outgrowth, and overall better cellular function. Supporting this hypothesis is the observation that other brain-penetrant agents targeting similar pathways have demonstrated increases in mitochondrial respiration and neuroprotection. Therefore, the expected effects of leriglitazone include not only biochemical and mitochondrial improvements but also measurable neurophysiological benefits in assays using FRDA patient-derived neuronal cultures (Edzeamey et al., 2024; Pizcueta et al., 2023; Rodríguez-Pascau et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
The comprehensive literature review indicates that leriglitazone is a highly promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia. One of its key strengths is its rational design as a synthetic PPARγ agonist with superior CNS penetration, which addresses a critical need in FRDA therapy given the disease’s prominent neurological manifestations. By selectively activating PPARγ, leriglitazone initiates a cascade that enhances PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis, upregulates mitochondrial chaperones like GRP75, and contributes to frataxin protein stabilization. This multi-level modulation of mitochondrial function directly targets the core pathogenic mechanisms of FRDA—mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and oxidative stress—suggesting that leriglitazone could restore cellular bioenergetics and improve clinical outcomes.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that treatment with leriglitazone increases frataxin protein levels in FRDA fibroblasts and improves bioenergetic markers, supporting the drug’s efficacy at the molecular level. Additionally, early clinical data in other CNS disorders, notably X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, confirm its ability to reach therapeutic concentrations in the brain and exhibit a tolerable safety profile. These observations, together with its well-defined mechanism of action, provide strong evidence of its potential benefit in FRDA. However, some limitations remain. The variability of frataxin level responses in different cell types—as observed with differential effects in neuronal versus cardiomyocyte models—is an important consideration, since FRDA pathology affects multiple tissues. Moreover, while the mechanistic rationale is robust, definitive clinical efficacy data specifically in FRDA patients are still emerging, and the potential for off-target effects common to the PPARγ agonist class (for example, fluid retention or weight gain) must be carefully monitored over longer treatment durations. Finally, the integration of transcriptional modulation, mitochondrial chaperone activity, and frataxin stabilization into a coherent, long-lasting therapeutic benefit remains to be validated in comprehensive phase II/III clinical trials.

In conclusion, based on the available biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature, leriglitazone represents a strong candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its design as a brain-penetrant PPARγ agonist makes it uniquely suited to overcome previous challenges encountered with conventional TZDs, and its ability to activate the PGC-1α pathway could translate into significant improvements in mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation. The therapeutic history of TZDs in related neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, combined with encouraging preclinical data in relevant FRDA models, further supports its potential. Nonetheless, future studies must confirm the extent to which leriglitazone can stabilize frataxin and modulate mitochondrial chaperones such as GRP75 in patient-derived neuronal networks, and whether these cellular improvements result in measurable clinical benefits. Overall, leriglitazone possesses several key strengths—including mechanistic specificity, CNS penetration, and translational progress—that justify its continued evaluation and development as a disease-modifying therapy for Friedreich’s Ataxia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Edzeamey et al., 2024; Pandolfo et al., 2022; Pizcueta et al., 2023; Rodríguez-Pascau et al., 2021).

Elamipretide (SS-31),"Proposal for Elamipretide (SS-31)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Elamipretide (also known as SS-31, MTP-131, or Stealth peptide) is a synthetic aromatic-cationic tetrapeptide designed to target mitochondria. It was originally developed based on the Szeto–Schiller peptides—a class of compounds characterized by an alternating cationic and aromatic amino acid sequence that facilitates cell membrane penetration and preferential accumulation in mitochondria (Mitchell et al., 2022). These peptides are synthesized chemically in the laboratory using standard peptide synthesis techniques, and they are formulated for systemic administration. Elamipretide belongs to a class of mitochondria-targeted therapeutics that have been developed to improve bioenergetics by stabilizing mitochondrial membranes and reducing oxidative stress (Oliver & Reddy, 2019). This class of compounds has previously been used in preclinical and clinical investigations to treat mitochondrial dysfunction across a spectrum of conditions, including primary mitochondrial myopathies and ischemia-reperfusion injury in cardiac tissues (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Jiang et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Elamipretide has undergone extensive preclinical evaluation as a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant and membrane-stabilizing agent. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the peptide can protect mitochondrial cristae structure, preserve electron transport chain (ETC) efficiency, and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in cellular and animal models of mitochondrial dysfunction (Allen et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020). Clinically, elamipretide has been evaluated in Phase 2 trials involving primary mitochondrial myopathy, Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), and other mitochondrial disorders, where it has shown modest improvements in ATP synthetic capacity (ATPmax) and functional outcomes such as exercise tolerance, with a favorable safety profile (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although elamipretide has not yet been approved for Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) specifically, its application in related mitochondrial disorders and cardiomyopathies is encouraging because FRDA is characterized by severe mitochondrial dysfunction including decreased ATP production and increased oxidative stress (Zhao et al., 2017). Preclinical investigations in FRDA cellular models have demonstrated that SS-31 upregulates frataxin protein expression, which is crucial since frataxin deficiency underlies the major mitochondrial pathology in FRDA; these findings indicate that elamipretide might be repurposed for FRDA (Zhao et al., 2017; Lew et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
Elamipretide’s known mechanism of action revolves around its selective binding to cardiolipin—a unique anionic phospholipid exclusively present in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) that is essential for maintaining mitochondrial cristae architecture and the proper assembly of respiratory chain complexes (Mitchell et al., 2021; Oliver & Reddy, 2019). By binding to cardiolipin, elamipretide stabilizes the mitochondrial inner membrane structure and prevents cardiolipin peroxidation—a key event that leads to cristae disruption and mitochondrial dysfunction during oxidative stress (Tamucci et al., 2023; Viscomi & Zeviani, 2020). This interaction has several downstream biochemical effects:
• It preserves the architecture of mitochondrial cristae, thereby sustaining the optimal organization of respiratory supercomplexes which is critical for efficient electron transport (Allen et al., 2020; Bottani et al., 2020).
• It enhances the coupling efficiency of the ETC, increasing ATP synthesis by reducing electron leakage and associated ROS formation (Zhao et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2020).
• It may also mitigate factors that lead to mitochondrial depolarization and apoptosis under conditions of oxidative stress (Tamucci et al., 2023).

These molecular actions are of particular interest in FRDA because the deficiency of frataxin in this disorder leads to mitochondrial iron overload, impaired assembly and function of iron–sulfur (Fe–S) clusters, and subsequent disruption of ETC complexes and ATP synthesis (Zhao et al., 2017). Moreover, preclinical evidence shows that SS-31 can upregulate frataxin protein levels post-transcriptionally, providing a dual mechanism to counteract the primary defect in FRDA—both by improving mitochondrial bioenergetics through cardiolipin stabilization and by directly increasing the levels of the deficient protein (Zhao et al., 2017; Lew et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the expected effect of elamipretide in FRDA patient cardiomyocytes is to restore mitochondrial cristae integrity and enhance the stability of ETC supercomplexes, thereby boosting maximal respiration and ATP synthesis. In the proposed assay, treatment with elamipretide is predicted to:
• Increase mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), a direct indicator of improved ETC coupling and bioenergetics (Tamucci et al., 2023).
• Enhance maximal ATP synthetic rate (ATPmax) as observed in prior clinical trials with mitochondrial myopathy populations (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
• Reduce ROS accumulation by stabilizing cardiolipin, thereby decreasing oxidative damage within mitochondria, which is particularly relevant in FRDA where high levels of oxidative stress exacerbate cell dysfunction (Jiang et al., 2020; Viscomi & Zeviani, 2020).
• Upregulate frataxin expression in a posttranscriptional manner, which is crucial as frataxin deficiency is the root cause of FRDA pathology (Zhao et al., 2017; Lew et al., 2022).

Furthermore, gene expression studies have established that frataxin is indeed expressed in cardiomyocytes; hence, the restoration of mitochondrial function in this cell type is directly relevant to the cardiac manifestations often observed in FRDA patients (Edzeamey et al., 2024). The proposed assays would measure outcomes such as mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ATP production, ROS levels, and direct imaging of mitochondrial cristae structure, all of which are predicted to improve following elamipretide treatment (Lynch, 2022; Oliver & Reddy, 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
Elamipretide shows significant promise as a repurposed drug candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on several compelling lines of evidence. Its synthetic origins and classification within a well-established drug class of mitochondria-targeted peptides provide a strong technical basis for its development (Mitchell et al., 2022). The extensive preclinical and early clinical data demonstrating improvements in mitochondrial function—particularly in terms of enhanced ATP production, stabilized cristae integrity, and reduced ROS levels—underscore its potential to address the mitochondrial dysfunction that is central to FRDA pathology (Jiang et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2017). Importantly, the ability of SS-31 to upregulate frataxin protein levels uniquely positions it to counteract the primary molecular defect in FRDA (Zhao et al., 2017; Lew et al., 2022).

Strengths of elamipretide for FRDA include its well-characterized mechanism of action—binding to cardiolipin to enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics—and its established safety and tolerability in human trials for related mitochondrial diseases (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Its dual activity of both structural mitochondrial protection and frataxin upregulation is particularly attractive, as it addresses multiple facets of FRDA pathology. Furthermore, the favorable pharmacokinetic and dosing data from previous trials allow for rapid translation into FRDA-focused studies.

However, there are also challenges and weaknesses to consider. Despite promising preclinical data, direct clinical evidence in FRDA patients remains limited, so the translational efficacy in neurodegenerative contexts must be rigorously evaluated. There is also the inherent complexity of FRDA pathology, which extends beyond mitochondrial dysfunction to include systemic iron dysregulation and neuronal degeneration; a mono-therapeutic approach, even one that restores mitochondrial function, may only partially address the disease. Additionally, while the safety profile in other mitochondrial disorders is reassuring, long-term dosing in a pediatric or young adult FRDA population (given the early onset of the disease) may present unique challenges that require dedicated investigation (Lynch, 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In conclusion, the comprehensive literature review strongly supports the hypothesis that elamipretide can enhance mitochondrial cristae integrity and ETC supercomplex stability in FRDA cardiomyocytes, leading to improved maximal respiration and ATP synthesis. The multiple studies referenced affirm its mechanism via cardiolipin binding, the subsequent benefits for mitochondrial function, and its potential to upregulate frataxin—the key protein deficient in FRDA. Thus, elamipretide emerges as a compelling candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia, warranting further preclinical validation in FRDA-specific models as well as early-phase clinical studies to investigate its efficacy in restoring mitochondrial bioenergetics and mitigating the clinical progression of this devastating disease (Mitchell et al., 2021; Viscomi & Zeviani, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).

SS-31 (Elamipretide; Stealth BioTherapeutics),"Proposal for SS-31 (Elamipretide; Stealth BioTherapeutics)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SS-31, also known as Elamipretide or MTP-131, is a synthetic, cell-permeable tetrapeptide originally developed by Stealth BioTherapeutics. It was discovered through research efforts aimed at restoring mitochondrial bioenergetics by targeting cardiolipin—a unique phospholipid found exclusively in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) that is vital for maintaining cristae integrity and electron transport chain (ETC) organization (Szeto, 2014). SS-31 belongs to the class of Szeto-Schiller peptides, characterized by an alternating aromatic and cationic amino acid motif (D-Arg–dimethyl-Tyr–Lys–Phe-NH2) that facilitates its efficient membrane penetration and selective mitochondrial targeting (Karaa et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2019). This peptide’s design exploits the unique electrostatic interplay with cardiolipin, allowing it to insert into the mitochondrial membrane independent of the membrane potential, thereby distinguishing it from other mitochondria‐targeted molecules that typically require active transport mechanisms (Mitchell et al., 2021). Historically, peptide‐based mitochondrial therapeutics have been explored for their antioxidant capacities and ability to stabilize mitochondrial membranes, a strategy that addresses the bioenergetics failure seen in various aging-related and mitochondrial disorders (Szeto & Birk, 2014).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of SS-31 spans preclinical models to multiple human clinical trials addressing mitochondrial dysfunction. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that SS-31 can improve mitochondrial ATP production, reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reverse mitochondrial depolarization under stress conditions (Birk et al., 2014; Mitchell et al., 2019). Clinically, SS-31 has been investigated in conditions such as primary mitochondrial myopathy (PMM) and heart failure, where its capacity to enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics has been validated in randomized, dose-escalation trials (Karaa et al., 2018; Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2016). Additionally, clinical evaluation in Barth Syndrome, a genetic mitochondrial disorder with cardiomyopathy as a hallmark, has provided further evidence of SS-31’s mitochondrial protective effects (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2017). Importantly, an investigator-initiated study conducted at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia specifically evaluated the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of SS-31 in Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA)—a neurodegenerative disorder marked by mitochondrial dysfunction due to frataxin deficiency—supporting the rationale for its repurposing in FRDA (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 2022). In the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, although direct clinical efficacy data appear limited, the compound’s mechanistic promise, supported by its safety and pharmacokinetic profile from prior trials, forms a compelling basis for further investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Mechanism of Action:
SS-31’s mechanism of action is rooted in its robust interaction with cardiolipin on the IMM. Cardiolipin is essential for forming and maintaining the structural integrity of the mitochondrial cristae and for optimizing the assembly of respiratory supercomplexes that include ETC complexes I–IV (Szeto, 2014; Mitchell et al., 2022). By reversibly binding to cardiolipin, SS-31 stabilizes the cytochrome c/cardiolipin complex, thereby preventing the peroxidation of cardiolipin and reducing the propensity of cytochrome c to acquire peroxidase activity—a key step in triggering apoptosis (Szeto & Birk, 2014; Mitchell et al., 2019). This stabilization results in improved electron transfer efficiency among ETC complexes, leading to enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, increased ATP synthesis, and ultimately a better coupling of oxygen consumption (Chatfield et al., 2019). Moreover, SS-31 reduces the leakage of electrons that typically form ROS, which not only preserves mitochondrial function but also minimizes oxidative stress—a major pathological driver in FRDA (Edzeamey et al., 2024; Mitchell et al., 2021). Biophysical investigations indicate that SS-31 modulates mitochondrial membrane surface electrostatics and lipid organization, thereby enhancing mitochondrial plasticity and resilience under metabolic stress (Mitchell et al., 2021; Tamucci et al., 2023). Its peptide structure and physicochemical properties, including its amphipathic nature and net positive charge, allow for rapid tissue uptake and mitochondrial localization, which is critical because it can act directly at the site of bioenergetic deficiency in FRDA patient-derived cells (Pepe, 2019).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for using SS-31 in Friedreich’s Ataxia is that the peptide will bind to cardiolipin in the defective mitochondria of FRDA patients, thereby stabilizing cristae architecture and enhancing the formation of electron transport chain supercomplexes. In FRDA, there is a well-documented impairment in mitochondrial function primarily due to frataxin deficiency, which disrupts iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, leading to aberrant electron transfer and excessive ROS production (Edzeamey et al., 2024; Lew et al., 2022). By restoring the structural integrity of the IMM, SS-31 is expected to promote optimal docking and assembly of ETC complexes (I–IV), resulting in improved maximal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and ATP output in affected cells (Chatfield et al., 2019; Mitchell et al., 2021). Support for this expectation comes from studies in animal models of mitochondrial dysfunction, including those examining conditions akin to FRDA, in which treatment with SS-31 led to improvements in mitochondrial respiration and decreased oxidative damage (Mitchell et al., 2019; Lew et al., 2022). Given that FRDA patient-derived cardiomyocytes express the critical components of the ETC and cardiolipin, the restoration of these parameters by SS-31 should translate into measurable functional improvements such as enhanced contractility and reduced cellular stress (Chatfield et al., 2019; Scott et al., 2024). Furthermore, the phase 1/2 clinical safety and pharmacokinetic data gathered from previous trials underscore the feasibility of repurposing SS-31 with appropriate dosing regimens in FRDA patients (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov).

Overall Evaluation:
SS-31 represents a promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on its well-established ability to target and stabilize mitochondrial membranes via binding to cardiolipin, thereby enhancing the function of the electron transport chain. Its synthetic peptide nature, derived from the Szeto-Schiller class of compounds, affords high specificity for the IMM and enables restoration of mitochondrial bioenergetics, which is the central defect in FRDA (Szeto, 2014; Mitchell et al., 2019). One of the major strengths of SS-31 is its demonstrated efficacy in improving mitochondrial respiration, reducing ROS production, and stabilizing membrane architecture in various preclinical and clinical models, including trials in mitochondrial myopathy and heart failure (Karaa et al., 2018; Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2017). Furthermore, its previous use in FRDA-relevant contexts, evidenced by the FRDA Investigator Initiated Study at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, supports the concept that mitochondrial bioenergetic deficits in FRDA may be mitigated by SS-31 (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 2022).

From a biophysical perspective, the ability of SS-31 to engage directly with cardiolipin and modulate the mitochondrial membrane environment is particularly compelling for FRDA, where disrupted iron-sulfur cluster assembly and mitochondrial structural abnormalities are early and crucial features of the disease (Mitchell et al., 2021; Edzeamey et al., 2024). This mechanism not only stabilizes the mitochondria but may also promote the assembly of ETC supercomplexes, thereby increasing maximal oxygen consumption and ATP generation, which are critically compromised in FRDA (Chatfield et al., 2019; Lew et al., 2022).

However, there are also limitations and uncertainties. The direct clinical efficacy of SS-31 in FRDA remains to be conclusively demonstrated since most existing clinical data on SS-31 pertain to other mitochondrial diseases and conditions such as PMM, Barth Syndrome, and heart failure (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2016; Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2017). The pharmacodynamic and long-term effects specifically in the context of FRDA pathology still need further exploration. Additionally, while FRDA pathophysiology shares core mitochondrial features with other disorders, the chronic progression and neurodegenerative aspects of FRDA may present unique hurdles that require optimization of dosing and possibly combination therapies to achieve meaningful clinical benefits (Manto, 2022; Scott et al., 2024). Furthermore, the limited blood-brain barrier penetration of SS-31 may restrict its efficacy in preventing or reversing neurological deficits in FRDA, where central nervous system involvement is significant (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 2022; Ji et al., 2021).

In summary, SS-31 shows considerable promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on its robust mitochondrial-targeted mechanism, strong preclinical data on improving mitochondrial bioenergetics, and an established safety record in early clinical trials. Its capacity to bind cardiolipin, stabilize mitochondrial cristae, and promote ETC supercomplex formation directly addresses the hypothesized therapeutic mechanism in FRDA. Despite the need for further dedicated studies in FRDA models and patient populations to validate its efficacy in this specific context, the existing biochemical, preclinical, and clinical evidence provides a solid rationale for advancing SS-31 into more focused FRDA clinical development (ClinicalTrials.gov; Mitchell et al., 2019; Chatfield et al., 2019).

Overall, the strengths of SS-31 include its innovative mitochondrial-targeted design, proven effect on restoring mitochondrial bioenergetics, and supportive safety/PK data from previous human trials. The potential weaknesses include the need to optimize CNS exposure in FRDA patients and the current paucity of direct clinical efficacy data in FRDA, which must be addressed in subsequent phase 2/3 trials. Given these considerations, the repurposing of SS-31 for Friedreich’s Ataxia is scientifically compelling and warrants further preclinical validation and clinical evaluation to determine its full therapeutic potential.

RG2833 (HDAC Inhibitor),"Proposal for RG2833 (HDAC Inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
RG2833, also known as RGFP109, is a synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor belonging to the pimelic diphenylamide class of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. This compound was developed by introducing modifications to the benzamide scaffold in order to target epigenetic dysregulation, with a particular focus on overcoming the transcriptional silencing of the FXN gene that characterizes Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA). The compound was synthesized through medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at optimizing brain penetration and metabolic stability, and it belongs to a class of HDAC inhibitors that have previously been explored mainly within oncology but have more recently been repurposed for neurodegenerative disorders. In preclinical studies, the 2-aminobenzamide class of HDAC inhibitors, including RG2833, has been shown to lead to increased acetylation of histones at key residues in the chromatin region around the FXN gene, thereby alleviating gene silencing (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Soragni et al., 2014).

Therapeutic History:
HDAC inhibitors, as a drug class, have a long history of use in oncology, where their ability to alter chromatin structure and gene expression has been leveraged to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. However, over the last decade multiple studies have repurposed these compounds for neurodegenerative conditions. RG2833 was originally developed based on biochemical evidence gathered from FRDA patient-derived cells and animal models. Preclinical studies demonstrated that treatment with RG2833 results in an increase in both FXN mRNA and frataxin protein levels in fibroblasts and lymphoblasts derived from FRDA patients, as well as in neuronal cells differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Soragni et al., 2014). Similarly, mouse models of FRDA, such as the YG8R transgenic mice, have provided evidence that administration of pimelic diphenylamide HDAC inhibitors, including RG2833 and related compounds like RGFP109, can lead to improved mitochondrial function, as measured by restoration of iron–sulfur cluster enzyme activity and improvements in motor coordination (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Sandi, 2010). Furthermore, early-phase clinical trials have established a tolerability profile for RG2833; the compound has demonstrated target engagement in humans through its ability to increase histone acetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and trends toward increased FXN expression in FRDA patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Strawser et al., 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, RG2833 functions by selectively inhibiting class I HDACs, particularly HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3. The therapeutic rationale for this approach in FRDA is directly linked to the epigenetic pathogenesis of the disease. In FRDA, expanded GAA·TTC triplet repeats in intron 1 of the FXN gene lead to heterochromatin formation and a localized decrease in histone acetylation. This hypoacetylated state is associated with an impaired transcriptional environment that results in reduced FXN mRNA and consequently lower levels of frataxin protein, a critical protein involved in mitochondrial iron–sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly and oxidative phosphorylation (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Sandi, 2010).

RG2833 reverses this gene silencing by binding to the catalytic pockets of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 with a slow-on/slow-off kinetic mechanism. This prolonged inhibition results in increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 near the FXN locus, particularly at sites such as H3K9, H4K5, and H4K12, which are critical for maintaining an open and transcriptionally active chromatin configuration (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Soragni, Chou, Rusche, & Gottesfeld, 2015). The increased histone acetylation relieves the repressive chromatin environment, allowing RNA polymerase II to engage more effectively with the FXN promoter, thereby restoring transcriptional activity. Beyond histone modifications, evidence suggests that treatment with RG2833 also correlates with improvements in downstream mitochondrial parameters, including increased activity of Fe-S cluster–dependent enzymes and improved ATP generation, which critically depend on sufficient frataxin levels (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Strawser et al., 2017). The compound’s selectivity for HDAC3 is particularly significant because HDAC3 has been found to be a major regulator of FXN gene silencing in FRDA patient cells, and selective inhibition of HDAC3 appears to be a key mechanism by which FXN transcription is reactivated (Soragni & Gottesfeld, 2016; Soragni et al., 2015).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underlying the use of RG2833 in FRDA is that by increasing histone acetylation at the FXN gene locus, the compound will de-repress FXN transcription, leading to an upregulation of FXN mRNA and a consequential increase in frataxin protein. In vitro studies have consistently demonstrated that treatment of FRDA patient-derived fibroblasts or lymphoblasts with RG2833 results in a two- to threefold increase in FXN mRNA levels to levels comparable to those seen in asymptomatic heterozygous individuals (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Soragni et al., 2014). This is significant because even a moderate restoration of frataxin levels (approximately 50% of normal) is thought to be potentially therapeutic in FRDA, given that heterozygous carriers do not develop the symptoms of the disease.

Furthermore, the reactivation of FXN transcription is expected to have downstream effects on mitochondrial function. Frataxin is essential for the proper biogenesis of Fe-S clusters – critical components in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes – and its deficiency leads to impaired ATP generation and increased oxidative stress. Therefore, by upregulating FXN expression, RG2833 is hypothesized to improve mitochondrial respiration and overall cellular energy metabolism. This improvement in mitochondrial function may be reflected in enhanced activity of Fe-S cluster enzymes, increased oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and improved ATP production in treated cells (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Strawser et al., 2017). In animal models, these biochemical effects have translated into functional improvements, such as enhanced motor coordination and reduced neurodegenerative pathology. The expectation is that similar improvements in mitochondrial protein function and energy production will occur in FRDA patients, potentially translating to clinical benefits in terms of neurological function and cardiac performance, which are key aspects of FRDA pathology (Zesiewicz et al., 2020; Strawser et al., 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
The accumulated preclinical and early clinical evidence presents RG2833 as a promising therapeutic candidate for FRDA. Its primary strength lies in its rational design and mechanism of action: by selectively inhibiting class I HDACs, especially HDAC3, RG2833 directly targets the epigenetic modifications that lead to FXN gene silencing. The ability of RG2833 to restore histone acetylation and reactivate FXN transcription has been consistently demonstrated in FRDA patient cells and animal models, where the resultant improvements in mitochondrial function have been documented. The safety profile observed in Phase I studies lends further support to its continued development, making it a strong candidate for further clinical trials (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Soragni et al., 2014; Strawser et al., 2017).

Nevertheless, there are some notable challenges and potential weaknesses. One concern is the suboptimal central nervous system (CNS) bioavailability that has been observed with earlier compounds in the class, although RG2833 has demonstrated improved brain penetration relative to its predecessors. Metabolic liabilities also exist, as the drug is known to be metabolized into inactive and potentially toxic benzimidazole metabolites that could present challenges during long-term administration – a significant concern given the chronic nature of FRDA (Soragni et al., 2014; Soragni et al., 2015). Additionally, while early-phase clinical trials have confirmed target engagement and a favorable safety profile, robust clinical efficacy data demonstrating meaningful clinical or functional improvements in FRDA patients remain to be established. This is an important consideration, as the ultimate goal is to improve neurological and cardiac outcomes rather than merely achieving biochemical changes at the molecular level (Soragni & Gottesfeld, 2016; Zesiewicz et al., 2020).

Furthermore, while the mechanism of increasing histone acetylation at the FXN locus is well supported by both preclinical and early clinical evidence, there is inherent complexity in epigenetic regulation that may result in off-target effects or variable patient responses. The epigenetic landscape in FRDA is intricate, and the long-term consequences of HDAC inhibition on the global gene expression profile are not fully known. Although studies have suggested that 2-aminobenzamide HDAC inhibitors tend to have a relatively limited impact on global gene expression – affecting only a few hundred genes with modest fold changes – careful monitoring of potential adverse effects remains critical (Soragni & Gottesfeld, 2016; Strawser et al., 2017).

In summary, the preclinical data have rigorously demonstrated that RG2833 can reverse the epigenetic silencing of the FXN gene by increasing histone acetylation, leading to meaningful increases in FXN mRNA and frataxin protein levels. This biochemical restoration correlates with improved mitochondrial function and suggests downstream benefits that could ameliorate the clinical manifestations of FRDA. Early clinical safety studies further support the feasibility of the compound’s use in humans. However, long-term clinical efficacy, optimal dosing regimens, and mitigation of potential toxic metabolites remain issues to be addressed in future studies. Overall, RG2833 represents a strong candidate for further development as a disease-modifying therapy for FRDA, with the potential to address the root cause of frataxin deficiency through targeted epigenetic modulation (Gottesfeld, Rusche, & Pandolfo, 2013; Soragni et al., 2015; Soragni & Gottesfeld, 2016; Strawser et al., 2017).

Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera),"Proposal for Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), commercially known as Tecfidera, is a methyl ester of fumaric acid derived by chemical modification of fumaric acid into a more lipophilic compound that enhances its oral bioavailability. As a synthetic derivative belonging to the fumaric acid ester class, DMF was originally developed and approved for use in multiple sclerosis and psoriasis due to its potent anti‐inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. In terms of its chemical origin, DMF is produced via esterification reactions that convert fumaric acid into a dimethyl ester, endowing the molecule with the necessary properties to cross the blood–brain barrier and interact with intracellular targets. This class of compounds is recognized for their ability to modulate redox homeostasis in cells mostly through activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Because of its capacity to activate Nrf2 and modulate other signaling cascades such as the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, DMF has been repurposed as a potential therapeutic candidate in diseases characterized by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, including Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) (Abeti et al., 2022; Bresciani et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Dimethyl fumarate has an established history in clinical medicine as a treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis, with decades of clinical use supporting a robust safety profile and clear pharmacokinetic properties. Its approval by the FDA for multiple sclerosis underscores its validated clinical efficacy in modulating inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways, despite being primarily indicated for immunomodulation. In preclinical studies using cellular and animal models, DMF has been shown to increase the expression of frataxin—a protein deficient in Friedreich’s Ataxia—and enhance mitochondrial gene expression and function. For instance, studies in FA patient-derived fibroblasts and lymphoblasts have demonstrated significant dose-dependent increases in frataxin mRNA and protein expression upon treatment with DMF (Jasoliya et al., 2019). Furthermore, oral dosing of DMF in FRDA mouse models rescued mitochondrial dysfunction, increased aconitase activity, and led to improvements in biochemical markers of mitochondrial health (Hui et al., 2020). Although DMF has not yet been assessed in official clinical trials for Friedreich’s Ataxia, its repurposing for FRDA is strongly supported by preclinical evidence as well as by its extensive use in other neurodegenerative contexts, where its mechanism of action aligns with the pathophysiology seen in FRDA (Pane et al., 2023; Rufini et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
DMF’s primary mode of action involves the activation of the Nrf2 pathway—a master regulator of cellular antioxidant responses. Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its inhibitory partner Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which targets Nrf2 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. DMF acts as a reactive electrophile that covalently modifies cysteine residues on Keap1. This covalent modification disrupts the Keap1–Nrf2 complex, thereby preventing Nrf2 degradation, and permits Nrf2 to translocate into the nucleus where it binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in DNA. This binding initiates the transcription of a wide range of cytoprotective and antioxidant genes, including those involved in detoxification, glutathione synthesis, and mitochondrial protection (Abeti et al., 2022; Strawser et al., 2017). Additionally, DMF indirectly activates the AMPK pathway, a central energy sensor in the cell that, when activated, phosphorylates and induces the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). PGC-1α is a key transcriptional coactivator that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Thus, by stimulating AMPK signaling, DMF may promote the upregulation of PGC-1α expression, leading to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and improved bioenergetics in cells afflicted by mitochondrial dysfunction, such as FRDA neurons (Jasoliya et al., 2019; Pane et al., 2023; Rufini et al., 2022). This multifaceted mechanism—combining antioxidant gene induction with potential enhancements in mitochondrial biogenesis—addresses both the oxidative stress and the bioenergetic deficits that are central to FRDA pathogenesis.

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis under evaluation, it is anticipated that DMF will ameliorate the bioenergetic deficits in FRDA by executing two interrelated actions: first, through robust activation of the Nrf2 pathway which will lead to the increased transcription of antioxidant genes, thereby reducing cellular oxidative stress; and second, by indirectly stimulating the AMPK pathway which will, in turn, enhance the activity of PGC-1α, resulting in increased mitochondrial biogenesis. In vitro studies in FRDA models have already shown that DMF leads to upregulation of frataxin levels, an increase in mitochondrial gene expression and function, and a corresponding reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (Abeti et al., 2022; Hui et al., 2020). These effects are expected to be measurable in assays that quantify mitochondrial DNA copy number, enzymatic activities such as that of aconitase (a marker of iron–sulfur cluster integrity), and overall improvements in cellular ATP production. The expression of Nrf2 and its downstream targets has been documented in neuronal and fibroblast cell lines, which are commonly used models in FRDA studies (Jasoliya et al., 2019; Pane et al., 2023). In addition, given that AMPK activation is well established to improve cellular energy metabolism and promote mitochondrial renewal, treatment with DMF should lead to heightened ATP production and enhanced metabolic resilience in neurons that are typically vulnerable to mitochondrial deficits in FRDA (Rufini et al., 2022; Strawser et al., 2017). Collectively, these expected effects are mechanistically consonant with DMF’s known pharmacological properties and align with the corrective actions needed to counteract the oxidative stress and bioenergetic impairment that are hallmarks of FRDA.

Overall Evaluation:
The potential repurposing of DMF for the treatment of Friedreich’s Ataxia is supported by a robust mechanistic rationale and a body of preclinical data that highlights its ability to improve mitochondrial function and augment antioxidant defenses. One of the most significant strengths of DMF lies in its established safety profile and clinical track record in its current indications, such as multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. This confers a degree of assurance regarding its tolerability and pharmacokinetics, which is further supported by the fact that the effective human-equivalent doses for mitochondrial effects in animal models are within the clinically used dose ranges (Hui et al., 2020; Jasoliya et al., 2019). Moreover, the dual action of DMF on both the Nrf2 and AMPK pathways addresses key aspects of FRDA pathophysiology: by activating Nrf2, DMF is well positioned to counteract the heightened oxidative stress featured in FRDA, while the potential upregulation of PGC-1α via AMPK activation contributes to restoring mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism (Abeti et al., 2022; Pane et al., 2023).

Nonetheless, there remain certain weaknesses and gaps in the current data regarding DMF’s applicability to FRDA. One notable limitation is that, to date, there are no registered clinical trials specifically evaluating DMF in FRDA patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The majority of the evidence supporting DMF’s potential for FRDA comes from preclinical studies in cell and animal models. While these models have demonstrated promising increases in frataxin expression and improvements in mitochondrial function, the translation of these effects into meaningful clinical outcomes in FRDA patients remains to be clearly established (Jasoliya et al., 2019; Hui et al., 2020). There is also the challenge inherent in repurposing a drug designed for an immunomodulatory purpose; the pleiotropic effects of DMF that confer its neuroprotective properties might also, under certain conditions, lead to off-target effects that must be carefully monitored. Furthermore, while the activation of AMPK and consequent upregulation of PGC-1α is inferred from DMF’s known mechanisms in other contexts, direct evidence linking DMF with robust increases in mitochondrial biogenesis via these pathways in FRDA models is still emerging (Rufini et al., 2022; Strawser et al., 2017).

Despite these concerns, the overall scientific rationale for repurposing DMF is compelling. The convergence of oxidative stress, impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics, and reduced frataxin expression in FRDA creates a therapeutic window that DMF could exploit through its modulation of the Nrf2–Keap1 axis and related bioenergetic pathways. The biochemical and molecular data indicate that DMF’s actions in restoring redox balance and enhancing mitochondrial function could ameliorate the neurodegenerative process that underpins FRDA (Abeti et al., 2022; Bresciani et al., 2023). Additionally, its established oral availability makes DMF an attractive candidate in terms of patient compliance and ease of administration, which are critical components in chronic disorders like FRDA.

In conclusion, while direct clinical evidence of DMF’s efficacy in Friedreich’s Ataxia remains to be generated, the extensive preclinical data, along with its well-defined mechanism of action and favorable safety profile, provide strong support for further investigation. The hypothesis that DMF will activate Nrf2 and AMPK pathways in FRDA neurons—thereby enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, increasing PGC-1α expression, and ameliorating bioenergetic deficits—is well grounded in current molecular research (Jasoliya et al., 2019; Pane et al., 2023; Strawser et al., 2017). Given these strengths and the potential impact on mitochondrial function in FRDA, it would be worthwhile for the development team to pursue additional preclinical studies and eventually design early-phase clinical trials to rigorously test DMF’s therapeutic benefit in FRDA patients. The overall assessment of DMF as a repurposed agent for Friedreich’s Ataxia is therefore cautiously optimistic, with the recommendation to prioritize further investigation while closely monitoring any immunomodulatory or off-target effects that could arise from its pleiotropic mechanisms (Rufini et al., 2022; Tiberi et al., 2023).

KH176,"Proposal for KH176

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
KH176, also known by its later clinical designation sonlicromanol, is a synthetic, orally bioavailable, water‐soluble compound developed as a mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and redox modulator. It traces its origins to modifications of Trolox, a vitamin E derivative known for its antioxidant properties, but KH176 has been rationally optimized to specifically target mitochondrial redox imbalance rather than acting as a broad-spectrum antioxidant. This compound falls within the class of redox modulators, which are a subset of small‐molecule therapeutics designed to restore cellular redox homeostasis and improve mitochondrial function. The development process, involving advanced screening methods including automated image quantification and machine learning applied to patient‐derived fibroblast models with mitochondrial dysfunction, enabled the identification of KH176 for its potent ROS‐scavenging capabilities and its ability to enhance bioenergetic parameters in defective cellular models (Beyrath et al., 2018, pp. 2–3). Compounds of this class have historically been exploited for their ability to ameliorate oxidative stress in a variety of pathologies, and they have seen use in experimental settings for neuromuscular and mitochondrial disorders. In the case of KH176, its chemical structure has been fine‐tuned to provide favorable pharmacokinetics (PK), including blood–brain barrier permeability, and an acceptable safety profile, all of which are essential attributes for repurposing in neurodegenerative and multisystem mitochondrial diseases such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (FA) (Liufu & Wang, 2021, pp. 3–5).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of KH176 is notable for its progressive advancement through early-phase clinical studies. Initially evaluated in Phase I single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) studies in healthy male volunteers, KH176 demonstrated a favorable safety profile with well‐tolerated doses up to 800 mg in single-dose administrations and 400 mg twice daily in multiple-dose settings, with manageable and predictable pharmacokinetics (Koene et al., 2017, pp. 1–2). These early human studies, which detailed dose-dependent exposure and minimal adverse cardiac effects (provided dosing remained below critical plasma concentrations), established the foundational safety necessary to progress further into patient-centric trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). Subsequently, KH176 progressed into Phase II trials exemplified by the KHENERGY study in patients with mitochondrial m.3243A>G spectrum disorders—a genetically defined subset of mitochondrial diseases. Although this trial primarily focused on mitochondrial disorders associated with the m.3243A>G mutation, the resulting safety and exploratory efficacy data (including improvements in neuropsychological outcomes such as alertness and mood, as well as some gait parameters) provide mechanistic and clinical rationale for testing KH176 in related neuromuscular conditions (Janssen et al., 2019, pp. 1–2; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Preclinical data also support KH176’s efficacy: in mammalian models of mitochondrial dysfunction such as the Ndufs4−/− mouse model of Leigh disease, KH176 demonstrated improvements in motor performance, reductions in lipid peroxidation, and preservation of tissue microarchitecture—even though some endpoints, like lifespan extension, were not significantly altered (de Haas et al., 2017, pp. 2–3). To date, however, KH176 has not been directly studied in Friedreich’s Ataxia patients, though its mechanism and efficacy in analogous mitochondrial and neuromuscular diseases suggest a high potential for translational application in FA (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of KH176 is multifaceted, centering on its ability to modulate intracellular redox homeostasis. The primary active entity is not KH176 itself but its intracellularly produced metabolite, KH176m. KH176m exerts potent antioxidant effects by interacting with and activating the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin enzyme system, a critical endogenous antioxidant pathway that detoxifies peroxides and regulates redox signaling. Specifically, KH176m binds directly—according to in silico molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance studies—to peroxiredoxins such as Prdx2 and Prdx4, thereby enhancing their capacity to reduce hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides by accelerating NADPH consumption in the TrxR–Trx–Prdx cycle (Beyrath et al., 2018, pp. 10–11; Hankemeier & Smeitink, 2023, pp. 26–29). This selective interaction not only scavenges excessive ROS but also rebalances redox-sensitive signaling pathways that are dysregulated in mitochondrial diseases. In parallel, KH176m selectively inhibits microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), an enzyme downstream of cyclooxygenase activity responsible for catalyzing the formation of pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂). By reducing PGE₂ synthesis, KH176m exhibits anti-inflammatory effects without the broad prostaglandin suppression typically observed with classical NSAIDs, which is advantageous in mitigating side effects and preserving the production of cardioprotective prostanoids (Jiang, 2023, pp. 39–43; Smeitink et al., 2023, pp. 125–127). On the cellular level, the redox-modulating action of KH176 is associated with improvements in mitochondrial bioenergetics, evidenced by increased oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and potentially enhanced coupling efficiency of the electron transport chain. Although data specifically showing direct restoration of Complex I activity are limited, the overall decrease in oxidative stress is expected to mitigate secondary damage to Complex I and other respiratory chain components—a key consideration in diseases like Friedreich’s Ataxia where oxidative damage exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction (Liufu & Wang, 2021, pp. 5–7). Moreover, preclinical studies in disease models reveal that KH176 treatment correlates with reduced lipid peroxidation, decreased cellular ROS levels, and improved cell viability under oxidative stress conditions, thus underscoring its capability to restore mitochondrial function via redox modulation (Beyrath et al., 2018, pp. 6–7; de Haas et al., 2017, pp. 3–6).

Expected Effect:
Based on its well-characterized mechanism, the expected effect of KH176 in Friedreich’s Ataxia cells would be the reduction of mitochondrial ROS levels through targeted modulation of redox enzymes. In FRDA, one of the cardinal pathogenic features is the accumulation of mitochondrial oxidative damage resulting from frataxin deficiency, which disrupts iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis and ultimately impairs oxidative phosphorylation, particularly Complex I-driven electron transport. With KH176 reducing the burden of ROS (and particularly lipid peroxidation markers) by bolstering the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin system, it is anticipated that this compound would decrease redox stress and enable a partial restoration of normal Complex I activity and electron transport chain coupling. Preclinical models have shown that treatment with KH176 improves the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and reduces markers of oxidative damage; if similar effects are observed in FRDA cells, ATP production would likely increase, thus correcting one of the metabolic deficits observed in the disease (de Haas et al., 2017, pp. 2–3; Pitceathly et al., 2021, pp. 12–16). Moreover, the compound’s redox-modulating effect may also translate to improved cellular viability and function in tissues highly reliant on mitochondrial energy production, such as neurons and cardiomyocytes—cell types that are critically affected in Friedreich’s Ataxia (Liufu & Wang, 2021, pp. 3–5; Meng & Wu, 2023, pp. 3–5). From a molecular perspective, the restoration of redox balance is expected to normalize the expression and activity of key redox-sensitive proteins that regulate both mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics. Given that genes encoding components of the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin system are ubiquitously expressed and particularly enriched in metabolically active tissues, the intervention with KH176 is likely to produce measurable improvements in biochemical assays of mitochondrial function as well as downstream clinical endpoints such as gait performance and cognitive alertness (Janssen et al., 2019, pp. 5–7; Pitceathly et al., 2021, pp. 37–39). The hypothesis that KH176 will “restore Complex I activity and coupling efficiency” should be understood as an indirect effect: while KH176 may not directly upregulate Complex I enzyme activity, its reduction of ROS-mediated damage could allow Complex I to function more efficiently under conditions where the oxidative environment is less deleterious, thereby leading to increased ATP production (Jiang et al., 2021, p. 3).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, KH176 emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia. One of its primary strengths lies in its well-documented safety profile from early-phase human studies, where favorable pharmacokinetics and tolerability have been clearly demonstrated in healthy volunteers as well as in patients with other mitochondrial diseases (Koene et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015). The compound’s mechanism of action, which centers on selective redox modulation via the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin system and selective inhibition of mPGES-1, provides a sound biochemical rationale for addressing the oxidative stress that is a core contributor to the pathology of FRDA (Beyrath et al., 2018, pp. 10–11; Hankemeier & Smeitink, 2023, pp. 26–29). Preclinical data lending support to this mechanism include robust evidence of reduced cellular ROS, normalization of mitochondrial oxidative damage markers, and preservation of tissue microstructure in models of Complex I deficiency (de Haas et al., 2017, pp. 2–3; Beyrath et al., 2018, pp. 6–7).

However, the weaknesses of KH176 for application in Friedreich’s Ataxia are also apparent. Despite encouraging preclinical findings and the compound’s clinical safety in related mitochondrial disorders, direct clinical data in FRDA patients is currently lacking. The KHENERGY study, while providing important insights into the compound’s effects in patients with m.3243A>G mutations, did not yield significant improvements in motor outcomes such as gait, although there were measurable improvements in mood and alertness (Janssen et al., 2019, pp. 1–2; Janssen et al., 2019, pp. 5–7). This highlights a potential disconnect between biochemical improvements and clinically meaningful functional outcomes, a gap that has also been observed with other redox modulators like idebenone in FRDA (Liufu & Wang, 2021, pp. 5–7). In addition, while the hypothesis posits that KH176 will restore Complex I activity and coupling efficiency, the evidence so far suggests that its effects are predominantly mediated by reduction of oxidative stress rather than direct modulation of ETC complex enzymatic function; thus, the anticipated improvement in ATP production might be modest at best or may require combination with other therapeutic modalities to achieve robust bioenergetic restoration (Jiang et al., 2021, p. 3; Pitceathly et al., 2021, pp. 44–47). Another consideration is that the redox system is complex and highly regulated, meaning that intervention via a single modulatory pathway might not be sufficient on its own to reverse the multifactorial mitochondrial dysfunction observed in Friedreich’s Ataxia. Furthermore, while early phase clinical trials have indicated an acceptable safety profile, the long-term effects and potential off-target consequences of chronic redox modulation remain to be elucidated in the context of FRDA (Koene et al., 2017, pp. 10–11).

Despite these concerns, the overall strengths of KH176—including its well-tolerated dosing regimen, favorable PK profile, ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, and a mechanism that directly intersects with the pathogenic oxidative stress observed in mitochondrial diseases—make it a highly attractive candidate for further evaluation in Friedreich’s Ataxia. The current body of literature provides a strong rationale for advancing KH176 into proof-of-concept studies in FRDA cell lines and possibly in early-phase clinical trials in FRDA patients. Importantly, its potential to improve not only biochemical markers of mitochondrial function but also clinical endpoints, such as improvements in cognitive function and potentially neuromuscular performance, aligns well with the unmet clinical needs in FRDA (Pitceathly et al., 2021, pp. 12–16; Meng & Wu, 2023, pp. 3–5).

In conclusion, KH176 represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate based on its robust preclinical evidence of redox modulation, favorable safety profile in Phase I human trials, and biochemical mechanism that is directly relevant to the pathophysiology of Friedreich’s Ataxia. However, while the candidate has clear strengths, such as its specific modulation of the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin system and its potential anti-inflammatory benefits via selective mPGES-1 inhibition, challenges remain regarding its ability to deliver sustained improvements in mitochondrial complex functionality and clinical outcomes in FRDA. The next logical steps would include more focused preclinical studies in FRDA-specific cellular models to document changes in OCR, ATP production, and Complex I activity after KH176 treatment, followed by carefully designed clinical trials in FRDA patients to confirm its efficacy on neuromuscular function and overall quality of life. Given the promising biochemical rationale and the advantages gleaned from its studies in other mitochondrial diseases, KH176 merits further exploration as part of the therapeutic arsenal against Friedreich’s Ataxia while also considering the possibility of combination therapies that might synergize its effects with agents targeting complementary aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Janssen et al., 2019, pp. 8–9).

Overall, the repurposing of KH176 for Friedreich’s Ataxia is conceptually well grounded, and careful follow-up studies could help bridge the gap between preclinical promise and clinically meaningful outcomes. The next phases of research should focus on establishing its impact on mitochondrial ATP production, verifying its efficacy in directly modulating Complex I-related parameters, and ultimately quantifying improvements in patient-reported outcomes and functional measures in FRDA cohorts. This strategic approach will provide the necessary data to validate whether KH176 can meaningfully modify disease progression in Friedreich’s Ataxia, thereby providing a new avenue for intervention in a disease area with significant unmet medical need (de Haas et al., 2017, pp. 6–7; Pitceathly et al., 2021, pp. 44–47).

Nicotinamide riboside (Niagen; ChromaDex),"Proposal for Nicotinamide riboside (Niagen; ChromaDex)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a naturally occurring form of vitamin B3 that has garnered considerable interest as a direct precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). NR is naturally present in small quantities in milk and certain vegetables; however, its significance lies in its capacity to boost intracellular NAD+ levels when provided exogenously. Given that NAD+ is an essential coenzyme necessary for redox reactions, DNA repair, and metabolic regulation, NR occupies a unique niche among the nicotinamide derivative class of compounds. Industrial production of NR is performed via controlled microbial fermentation and chemical synthesis routes that yield high-purity material suitable for dietary supplementation as well as for clinical applications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). As a member of the NAD+ precursor class, NR is distinct from other vitamin B3 analogs such as niacin and nicotinamide due to its metabolic pathway which bypasses some of the intermediary steps required by the latter molecules, leading to more efficient augmentation of NAD+ pools. This class of compounds has previously been employed in several preclinical studies focused on aging and metabolic dysfunction; the underlying rationale has been to ameliorate deficiencies in mitochondrial function and to counteract the decline in NAD+ levels associated with age-related disease. Moreover, the biochemical and pharmacological properties of NR, including its oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile as demonstrated in early-phase clinical studies, make it an attractive candidate for repurposing towards the treatment of mitochondrial and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
The history of NR as a therapeutic candidate extends back over recent years during which it has been extensively tested in multiple models of aging, metabolic dysfunction, and mitochondrial disease. Preclinical studies have consistently shown that NR supplementation leads to increases in NAD+ levels across various tissues, a change that tends to correlate with improvements in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and overall bioenergetic homeostasis. For example, in experimental animal models of obesity and heart failure, administration of NR not only increased NAD+ levels but was also associated with enhanced mitochondrial DNA copy numbers and improved oxidative metabolism (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Similar results have been observed in preclinical studies that evaluated NR’s capacity to enhance mitochondrial function in models of neurodegeneration and muscle pathology. Early-phase clinical trials in humans have evaluated NR in populations with metabolic derangements, including obese individuals and patients with mitochondrial myopathies. These studies have provided evidence of oral bioavailability and a strong safety profile while also demonstrating a measurable increase in circulating NAD+ levels (Lloret & Beal, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, NR has been examined in recent clinical trials specifically targeting mitochondrial diseases and neurodegenerative conditions. For instance, trials such as NCT04192136 and NCT03432871 have explored the utility of NR in patient cohorts where mitochondrial dysfunction is a key component of the pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017). One trial at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia combined NR supplementation with exercise training in Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) patients to assess changes in aerobic capacity and metabolic biomarkers. Although these studies are largely focused on short-term biomarkers of mitochondrial function and safety, they provide a strong foundation to support NR’s further development as a therapeutic for disorders characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, including Friedreich’s Ataxia (Rufini et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, the mechanism of action of nicotinamide riboside is both well characterized and compelling in the context of mitochondrial disease. Once ingested, NR is absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract and enters the systemic circulation. Within target cells, NR is phosphorylated by nicotinamide riboside kinases – NRK1 and NRK2 – to generate nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NMN is then transformed into NAD+ by NMN adenylyltransferases. The net effect of this metabolic cascade is a robust elevation in intracellular NAD+ levels (Lloret & Beal, 2019). NAD+ serves as a substrate for several groups of enzymes, most notably the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases. Among the sirtuins, SIRT1—largely nuclear—and SIRT3—which is primarily mitochondrial—play critical roles in regulating mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis. When SIRT1 is activated by increased NAD+ levels, it deacetylates and activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), which is widely recognized as the master transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. Once activated, PGC-1α promotes the transcription of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, thereby leading to an increase in both the number and function of mitochondria. Concurrently, SIRT3 acts within the mitochondria by deacetylating key enzymes involved in the electron transport chain, which not only enhances oxidative phosphorylation efficiency but also improves the mitochondrial antioxidant defenses, notably by activating manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) (Marmolino et al., 2010). In the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, the deficiency of frataxin—a mitochondrial protein essential for iron-sulfur cluster assembly—compromises several iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes of the electron transport chain, leading to both bioenergetic failure and oxidative damage. By replenishing NAD+ levels, NR is proposed to act via the SIRT1/3–PGC-1α axis, thereby driving mitochondrial biogenesis, improving oxidative phosphorylation, and reducing oxidative stress. This cascade is supported by preclinical evidence in which boosting NAD+ levels resulted in increased mitochondrial DNA copy number, enhanced oxygen consumption, and reduced production of reactive oxygen species (Lloret & Beal, 2019; Koňaříková et al., 2020). In essence, the molecular actions of NR target a fundamental weakness in FRDA’s pathology – mitochondrial dysfunction – by reactivating key enzymes and transcriptional programs that are compromised in the diseased state.

Expected Effect:
Friedreich’s Ataxia is marked primarily by the loss of frataxin leading to impaired iron-sulfur cluster formation, reduced activity of key mitochondrial enzymes, and a consequent bioenergetic failure alongside increased oxidative stress. The administration of NR is expected to increase intracellular NAD+ concentrations, which in turn should activate NAD+-dependent deacetylases like SIRT1 and SIRT3. Through the activation of these sirtuins, NR supplementation is anticipated to promote the deacetylation and functional activation of PGC-1α, which will stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis. As a result, one would expect to observe an increase in mitochondrial DNA copy number as well as improvements in markers of mitochondrial function such as oxygen consumption rates, ATP production, and general bioenergetics. Additionally, the enhanced activity of SIRT3 is expected to lead to increased deacetylation of mitochondrial enzymes responsible for antioxidant defenses, thereby contributing to a reduction in reactive oxygen species and overall oxidative stress (Poddar et al., 2019). In functional cellular assays using FRDA patient-derived neurons or muscle cells, one would predict that NR will restore the bioenergetic capacity of these cells, reflected in enhanced mitochondrial respiration and improved viability under metabolic stress. These cellular-level changes should ideally translate into clinically observable improvements such as stabilization or improvement in neuromuscular coordination and a slowing in the progression of ataxia symptoms. Moreover, in clinical trials that include biomarkers of mitochondrial health, we anticipate that NR supplementation would demonstrate measurable increases in NAD+ levels in blood and possibly in relevant tissues, along with surrogate endpoints of mitochondrial function. The central hypothesis is that by correcting the bioenergetic deficit through a mechanism that drives mitochondrial biogenesis and enhances oxidative phosphorylation, NR will counteract a primary defect of FRDA, thereby offering neuroprotective benefits and improving patient outcomes (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
Nicotinamide riboside represents a scientifically robust and attractive candidate for repurposing as a treatment for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Several strengths support this evaluation. First, the mode of action of NR is clearly defined; by serving as a direct precursor to NAD+, NR is able to elevate intracellular NAD+ levels, thereby driving the activity of crucial NAD+-dependent enzymes such as SIRT1 and SIRT3. Activation of these sirtuins leads to deacetylation of PGC-1α, which in turn enhances mitochondrial biogenesis. This molecular pathway is particularly relevant given that the hallmark of FRDA is mitochondrial dysfunction precipitated by frataxin deficiency. Preclinical studies in diverse models of mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration have provided evidence that augmenting NAD+ levels results in improved mitochondrial function, enhanced ATP production, and reduced oxidative stress (Lloret & Beal, 2019; Marmolino et al., 2010). The biomolecular rationale is compelling in that NR directly addresses the energetic failure at the heart of FRDA pathology.

Second, early-phase clinical trials have already provided a strong indication that NR is safe and well tolerated in humans, with an oral bioavailability that supports both ease of administration and favorable patient compliance. Trials examining metabolic health in (pre)obese individuals have indicated that NR can be safely administered and shall lead to measurable increases in NAD+ levels (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, additional studies focused on mitochondrial diseases and neurodegenerative conditions (such as the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust trial) support NR’s potential to enhance mitochondrial function in affected patient populations (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017).

Third, there is a significant body of preclinical literature that speaks directly to the expected biochemical improvements resulting from NAD+ precursor supplementation. Studies have shown that NR supplementation leads to upregulation of mitochondrial DNA copy number, enhanced oxygen consumption, and improved metabolic profiles in cells subjected to mitochondrial stress. For instance, in models of neurodegeneration and in cardiac muscle-specific dysfunctions, elevated NAD+ levels following NR supplementation have correlated with improved mitochondrial and cellular function (Poddar et al., 2019). Such improvements in mitochondrial biomarkers are promising, given that similar changes may be anticipated in FRDA wherein bioenergetic failure is a major component of disease progression.

Despite these strengths, several challenges and limitations exist. Although there is abundant rationale from preclinical studies and early clinical trials in other conditions, direct clinical evidence in Friedreich’s Ataxia patients is not yet robust. Many clinical studies have thus far focused on surrogate endpoints such as biochemical markers (e.g., NAD+ levels, mitochondrial DNA copy number) rather than on hard clinical outcomes such as motor function or ataxia progression. Therefore, while NR’s capacity to improve mitochondrial markers is well supported, the translation of these improvements into clinically meaningful endpoints in FRDA remains to be established in large-scale, targeted clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Another consideration is that FRDA is a multifactorial disease that, in addition to mitochondrial dysfunction, involves epigenetic silencing of the frataxin gene, disruptions in iron metabolism, and other cellular stress responses. It is possible that a monotherapy approach solely based on NR-induced NAD+ elevation may not be sufficient to fully reverse or halt the progression of FRDA. There may be a requirement for combination therapies that address both the bioenergetic deficits and the gene regulatory anomalies associated with frataxin deficiency. Hence, while NR is a promising candidate, its therapeutic benefit might be optimized when used together with complementary agents that target other aspects of FRDA pathogenesis.

Additionally, although the safety profile of NR is encouraging over short-term administration, Friedreich’s Ataxia is a chronic disease, and patients may require lifelong treatment. As such, long-term safety and tolerability data specific to chronic use in the context of neurodegeneration are still needed. It will be critical to determine not only whether NR can sustainably elevate NAD+ levels over years but also whether such elevations consistently correlate with meaningful clinical improvements over extended periods of treatment (Rufini et al., 2022).

Furthermore, while preclinical results in animal models have been promising, establishing reliable biomarkers that bridge the gap between improved mitochondrial function in laboratory assays and observable clinical improvement in neuromuscular coordination remains a challenge. The heterogeneity of mitochondrial dysfunction in FRDA patients means that robust and reproducible biomarker studies are required to stratify patients and monitor therapeutic outcomes. Such biomarkers might include measurements of NAD+ levels, mitochondrial DNA copy number, oxygen consumption rates, and assessments of oxidative stress in both peripheral tissues and the central nervous system. Only by correlating these biomarkers with clinical improvements in motor function and other quality-of-life measures can the full therapeutic potential of NR be validated.

In summary, NR has several attractive features that support its candidacy as a repurposed drug for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its ability to elevate NAD+ levels and activate key mitochondrial regulatory pathways—including the SIRT1/3–PGC-1α axis—is directly aligned with the known pathophysiology of FRDA, where mitochondrial dysfunction is a central defect. The extensive preclinical evidence demonstrating that NAD+ precursors can ameliorate bioenergetic deficits and protect against oxidative stress, combined with the encouraging safety and bioavailability data from early-phase clinical studies in other conditions, make NR a scientifically compelling candidate for further investigation in FRDA populations (Lloret & Beal, 2019; Marmolino et al., 2010).

At the same time, the current limitations must be acknowledged. Direct clinical efficacy data in FRDA is still sparse, and the complexity of FRDA’s multifactorial pathogenesis may necessitate multi-targeted therapeutic strategies beyond simply boosting NAD+. Long-term studies are required to understand the chronic effects of NR supplementation in neurodegenerative settings. Additionally, the development and validation of clinically relevant biomarkers that can accurately predict therapeutic success in FRDA patients will be critical to advancing NR from a promising candidate to an established treatment.

Overall, given the strong mechanistic rationale, favorable safety profile, and encouraging preclinical findings, NR is a promising candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its mechanism—elevating NAD+ to activate sirtuin-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis—addresses a fundamental aspect of FRDA pathophysiology, and there is a robust body of evidence supporting this approach in other models of mitochondrial dysfunction (Lloret & Beal, 2019; Poddar et al., 2019). However, advancing NR into large-scale, controlled clinical trials specifically targeting FRDA will be essential to determine whether improvements in mitochondrial biomarkers translate into meaningful clinical benefits such as improved motor coordination, slowed disease progression, and enhanced quality of life for patients. Continued investment in both mechanistic studies and clinical investigations is therefore warranted to explore the full potential of nicotinamide riboside as a therapeutic option for Friedreich’s Ataxia (Rufini et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

In conclusion, the repurposing of nicotinamide riboside (Niagen; ChromaDex) for Friedreich’s Ataxia is a scientifically compelling proposition that builds on decades of research into NAD+ metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. The preclinical evidence robustly supports the notion that elevating NAD+ levels can activate key mitochondrial biogenesis pathways through sirtuin-mediated deacetylation of PGC-1α and improve cellular energy metabolism. Early-phase clinical studies in related diseases further underscore NR’s safety, oral bioavailability, and ability to favorably modulate metabolic endpoints. Nonetheless, the complexity of FRDA pathogenesis, which includes frataxin deficiency, iron dysregulation, and epigenetic alterations in addition to mitochondrial dysfunction, suggests that NR might be most effective when used as part of a combination therapeutic strategy. Large, well-controlled long-term clinical trials focusing specifically on FRDA are needed in order to determine the extent to which NR-induced improvements in mitochondrial biomarkers translate into meaningful clinical benefits for patients. Given these considerations, nicotinamide riboside stands out as an attractive candidate that merits further rigorous evaluation in the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, and its development could potentially provide a much-needed therapeutic intervention for this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder (Lloret & Beal, 2019; Marmolino et al., 2010; Rufini et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

MitoQ,"Proposal for MitoQ

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MitoQ is a synthetic, mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant that was developed by conjugating a ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10) derivative to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) cation. This chemical modification enables the compound to selectively accumulate within mitochondria, driven by the large negative membrane potential of the inner mitochondrial membrane. As a member of the mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant class, MitoQ was originally designed to address oxidative stress by delivering its redox‐active moiety directly to the site of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation within mitochondria. This class of compounds has been previously employed in several domains, including cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and conditions marked by mitochondrial dysfunction. Their design overcomes the limitations of untargeted antioxidants by ensuring that the antioxidant is present at sufficiently high concentrations within the mitochondria to be effective. The ability of MitoQ to permeate lipid bilayers due to its TPP⁺ moiety and to concentrate several hundred‐fold inside mitochondria has been well documented in preclinical studies, making it a promising candidate for addressing diseases with a mitochondrial component (Smith et al., 2008).

Therapeutic History:
MitoQ’s history spans both preclinical and clinical investigations. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that MitoQ can effectively scavenge mitochondrial ROS and protect mitochondrial components from oxidative damage. In several neuronal and fibroblast models, treatment with MitoQ resulted in improved mitochondrial respiration, increased ATP production, and enhanced oxygen consumption rate (OCR), suggesting a potent bioenergetic benefit (Yin et al., 2016). Beyond its preclinical promise, MitoQ has advanced into clinical evaluation for various conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, hepatitis C, sickle cell anemia, multiple sclerosis, and peripheral arterial disease. These studies established its oral bioavailability and safety profile in humans (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023). Although direct clinical trials targeting Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) have not yet been reported, several clinical investigations in related disorders involving mitochondrial dysfunction underline its translational readiness (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
MitoQ exerts its antioxidant effects via a well‐characterized mechanism that involves several key biochemical steps. The TPP⁺ moiety attached to the ubiquinone confers rapid and selective mitochondrial uptake; once inside the mitochondrial matrix, MitoQ is reduced by components of the electron transport chain, primarily complex II, to form the active ubiquinol species. This reduced form acts as a potent antioxidant that scavenges ROS, particularly at the inner mitochondrial membrane where oxidative damage is most pronounced. By neutralizing ROS, MitoQ helps to prevent lipid peroxidation of mitochondrial membranes and protects critical mitochondrial proteins, including those containing iron‐sulfur (Fe‐S) clusters. In Friedreich’s Ataxia, the deficiency in frataxin leads to impaired synthesis and stability of Fe‐S cluster proteins, resulting in reduced electron transport chain activity and diminished ATP production. MitoQ’s mechanism is expected to mitigate these defects by lowering the burden of oxidative damage on Fe‐S proteins such as aconitase and complex I, thereby preserving their function. Additionally, by reducing the oxidative stress within mitochondria, MitoQ may enhance overall mitochondrial coupling efficiency and support improved oxygen consumption rates (OCR) (Rodríguez et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2008).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing MitoQ in Friedreich’s Ataxia is that its targeted antioxidant action will protect mitochondrial integrity by scavenging ROS at the site of their production—the inner mitochondrial membrane. In FRDA, oxidative stress is both a cause and consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired Fe‐S cluster assembly. With frataxin deficiency, ROS levels increase and contribute to the degradation of critical Fe‐S cluster–containing enzymes, such as mitochondrial aconitase and components of complex I. It is expected that MitoQ, by virtue of its selective accumulation in mitochondria, will reduce the levels of ROS sufficiently to prevent secondary damage to these proteins. Moreover, by alleviating oxidative stress, MitoQ should improve mitochondrial coupling efficiency, thereby promoting enhanced ATP production and higher OCR in affected neuronal and fibroblast cells. Since Fe‐S clusters are pivotal for the function of several enzymes in the respiratory chain, maintaining their integrity could reverse or slow the progression of mitochondrial dysfunction observed in FRDA. Several biochemical studies have indicated that mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants can improve enzyme function and bioenergetics in disease models characterized by mitochondrial oxidative stress (Marmolino, 2011; Rodríguez et al., 2020). Thus, the expected effect of MitoQ in FRDA is a protective restoration of mitochondrial function that translates into improved cellular energy metabolism, which could ultimately impact the neurodegenerative and cardiomyopathic phenotypes of the disease (Rodríguez et al., 2020; Cooper & Schapira, 2003).

Overall Evaluation:
MitoQ represents a strong candidate for repurposing in the treatment of Friedreich’s Ataxia due to several compelling reasons. One significant strength of MitoQ is its clearly defined mechanism of action: the compound selectively accumulates within mitochondria via its TPP⁺ conjugate, where it is converted to its active antioxidant form, thus directly neutralizing mitochondrial ROS and reducing oxidative stress (Smith et al., 2008; Szeto, 2006). This targeted delivery is particularly advantageous in FRDA, where mitochondrial oxidative damage plays a central role in the progression of neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathy. Additionally, preclinical data showing improvements in ATP production and OCR in neuronal and fibroblast models provide strong biochemical support for the use of MitoQ in conditions marked by impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics (Yin et al., 2016).

From a therapeutic history standpoint, MitoQ has been tested in a number of clinical settings involving diseases with oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, and its safety profile in humans is well‐established through multiple clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023). This existing clinical data significantly de‐risks its repurposing for FRDA by providing evidence of oral bioavailability and tolerability in humans. However, a weakness is that, to date, direct clinical evidence for its efficacy in Friedreich’s Ataxia is lacking, and most of the supportive data come from other disease models or preclinical studies (Rodríguez et al., 2020; Cooper & Schapira, 2003).

The detailed mechanism of action, as described, aligns well with the known pathophysiological features of FRDA. By protecting Fe‐S cluster proteins from ROS‐mediated damage, MitoQ has the potential to restore normal mitochondrial function, thereby ameliorating energy deficits and reducing the cascade of cellular dysfunction that leads to neurodegeneration. The expected biochemical improvements, including increased coupling efficiency, higher ATP production, and elevated OCR, are highly relevant to the bioenergetic defects observed in FRDA (Rodríguez et al., 2020; Marmolino, 2011; Voncken et al., 2004).

In summary, the strengths of MitoQ include its targeted mitochondrial delivery, robust antioxidant mechanism, demonstrated improvements in mitochondrial bioenergetics in relevant preclinical models, and proven oral bioavailability and safety from existing clinical trials. These factors collectively endorse its potential as a promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia. On the other hand, the lack of direct clinical data in FRDA patients and the possibility that its mechanism may only address secondary oxidative damage rather than the primary defect in Fe‐S cluster biogenesis are notable weaknesses. Overall, MitoQ appears to be a rational candidate for further preclinical validation in FRDA models, with the goal of subsequently designing targeted clinical trials to rigorously assess its efficacy in correcting the mitochondrial dysfunction central to FRDA pathology (Rodríguez et al., 2020; Marmolino, 2011; Voncken et al., 2004).

Dichloroacetate (DCA),"Proposal for Dichloroacetate (DCA)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a low molecular weight (approximately 150 Da) small molecule originally discovered as a by-product of chlorination processes and later synthesized for its ability to modulate cellular metabolism. It belongs to the class of metabolic modulators that target key regulatory enzymes within the mitochondria. Specifically, DCA is known for its capacity to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), thereby removing the inhibitory phosphorylation from the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) and promoting its activity. Unlike many large, biologically derived molecules, DCA is a fully synthetic compound known for its high oral bioavailability and capacity to cross biological barriers, including the blood–brain barrier. This characteristic supports its investigation not only in metabolic diseases but also as a potential therapeutic in neurodegenerative conditions where mitochondrial dysfunction is a core pathology (Stacpoole et al., 2008; Michelakis et al., 2008). Over the years, compounds from this class have been used in various settings—ranging from the treatment of congenital lactic acidosis and other mitochondrial disorders to experimental applications in cancer therapy, where reactivation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation serves to counteract the Warburg effect in tumor cells (Kankotia & Stacpoole, 2014).

Therapeutic History:
DCA has an extensive history of investigational use in mitochondrial disorders. It has been administered in both clinical and preclinical settings to treat conditions characterized by impaired oxidative metabolism, particularly congenital lactic acidosis and primary defects in the PDH complex. Early studies have demonstrated that DCA decreases blood lactate levels by enhancing PDH activity; these studies provided proof-of-concept that augmenting mitochondrial oxidation via PDK inhibition can ameliorate metabolic derangements (Abdelmalak et al., 2013; Stacpoole et al., 2008). In clinical practice and controlled trials involving patients with mitochondrial cytopathies, long-term administration of DCA has been associated with improvements in biochemical markers, notably reduced lactate accumulation, alongside evidence of metabolic stabilization (Abdelmalak et al., 2013; Stacpoole et al., 2008). Although no registered clinical trials have specifically evaluated DCA in Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) according to searches on ClinicalTrials.gov, its longstanding use in related mitochondrial diseases—including other neurodegenerative conditions with mitochondrial impairment—supports its translational potential (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, DCA has been explored in cancer research as a means to reverse metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells (Kankotia & Stacpoole, 2014), further corroborating its ability to modulate mitochondrial function and suggesting biological plausibility for repurposing in FRDA, which is also characterized by defective mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, DCA’s mechanism of action is well defined. The primary target of DCA is pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), a family of enzymes (PDK1–PDK4) that normally phosphorylate and inhibit the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. Under conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction or metabolic stress, PDK activity is upregulated, leading to decreased flux through PDH and a shift toward anaerobic glycolysis, which results in lactate accumulation and reduced cellular energy production (Michelakis et al., 2008; Stacpoole et al., 2008). By specifically binding to and inhibiting PDK, DCA relieves this inhibitory phosphorylation of the E1α subunit of PDH, thereby reactivating the enzyme complex (Stacpoole et al., 2008). This reactivation facilitates the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, enhancing entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and promoting efficient mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (Stacpoole et al., 2008).

Further, research indicates that DCA may have secondary effects on mitochondrial metabolism. For example, it can influence the expression of enzymes involved in glycolysis and the TCA cycle, and it affects cellular redox status by reducing lactate levels and thereby diminishing subsequent acidification and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Michelakis et al., 2008; Liou, 2011). Notably, while DCA’s inhibition of PDK leads to increased PDH activity, its metabolism is tightly linked to glutathione transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1), and genetic variabilities in this enzyme can influence DCA’s pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile, particularly with respect to peripheral neuropathy (Abdelmalak et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2023). This molecular cascade is central to the therapeutic hypothesis in FRDA, where frataxin deficiency disrupts iron–sulfur cluster formation and impairs mitochondrial energy production—making the modulation of PDH activity via PDK inhibition a plausible intervention to restore metabolic balance (Stacpoole et al., 2008).

Expected Effect:
Based on the mechanistic profile of DCA, the expected effect in the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia involves a metabolic shift in FRDA patient-derived neurons from glycolysis toward increased oxidative phosphorylation. In FRDA, neuronal cells exhibit compromised mitochondrial function and impaired PDH flux, contributing to energy deficits that underpin neurodegeneration. By inhibiting PDK, DCA is anticipated to reactivate PDH, thereby increasing the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and promoting its oxidation in the TCA cycle. This metabolic rerouting should result in elevated oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and increased ATP production, ultimately enhancing cellular bioenergetics in affected neurons (Zhang et al., 2023).

Experimental assays in FRDA cell models are expected to show biochemical markers consistent with restored PDH activity—such as decreased lactate levels and increased activity of mitochondrial enzymes like citrate synthase—as well as improved mitochondrial morphology and function (Stacpoole et al., 2008; Liou, 2011). In addition, in vitro studies of DCA in various cell types, including neuronal and glial models, have shown that enhanced PDH activity correlates with improved cellular survival under conditions of metabolic stress (Hong et al., 2018). Therefore, the current hypothesis predicts that treatment with DCA will correct the underlying bioenergetic deficiencies observed in FRDA patient-derived neuronal cultures, leading to measurable increases in OCR, ATP production, and overall improvements in mitochondrial function.

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of DCA as a therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia is encouraging based on its well-established mechanism of action and extensive clinical experience in related mitochondrial disorders. Among the primary strengths of DCA are its:

1. Mechanistic Rationale: The compound directly targets a central metabolic checkpoint—PDK inhibition—that governs the flux of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. Given that FRDA is characterized by impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, reactivation of PDH represents a targeted intervention aimed at correcting energy deficits in frataxin-deficient neurons (Stacpoole et al., 2008; Michelakis et al., 2008).

2. Extensive Preclinical and Clinical Data: DCA has a proven track record in enhancing mitochondrial metabolism in disorders such as congenital lactic acidosis and PDH deficiency. Although direct clinical data for FRDA are lacking, the extensive use of DCA in mitochondrial disorders provides strong supportive evidence for its safety and metabolic efficacy, particularly in younger populations (Abdelmalak et al., 2013; Stacpoole et al., 2008).

3. Pharmacological Advantages: High oral bioavailability and the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier are significant advantages for a therapeutic intended to target central nervous system neurons, making DCA a viable candidate for overcoming the delivery challenges inherent to neurological disorders (Michelakis et al., 2008).

4. Potential Synergy with Combination Therapies: Preclinical studies have indicated that DCA may function synergistically when combined with agents such as thiamine, which further optimize PDH complex activity. Combination regimens could potentially mitigate the dose-dependent adverse effects associated with DCA, particularly peripheral neuropathy (Abdelmalak et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2023).

Nonetheless, several weaknesses and concerns must be addressed:

1. Toxicity Issues: Chronic DCA administration has been associated with dose-dependent peripheral neuropathy in both animal models and human trials, a risk that may be exacerbated in older patients due to differential drug metabolism via GSTZ1. These adverse effects underscore the need for careful dosing strategies and possibly individualized regimen adjustments based on pharmacogenetic profiling (Liou, 2011; Stacpoole et al., 2008).

2. Variability in Metabolism: Inter-individual differences in GSTZ1 expression and function can markedly influence DCA clearance and plasma half-life, potentially leading to heterogeneous therapeutic outcomes. This variability may also necessitate the development of precision dosing regimens or advanced delivery systems to ensure consistent therapeutic exposure (Zhang et al., 2023; Abdelmalak et al., 2013).

3. Lack of Direct Data in FRDA: Although the biochemical rationale for DCA use in FRDA is robust, there remains a paucity of direct experimental data from FRDA-specific cellular or animal models. Rigorous preclinical studies are required to validate the hypothesized improvements in OCR, ATP production, and mitochondrial function in FRDA neurons before clinical translation can be considered (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Stacpoole et al., 2008).

4. Potential for Oxidative Stress: While enhancing oxidative phosphorylation is desirable, it may also lead to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The balance between improved energy production and the risk of exacerbating oxidative stress will need to be carefully managed, particularly in the context of FRDA, where oxidative damage is already a concern (Zhang et al., 2023; Liou, 2011).

Overall, DCA presents as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia, given its established ability to modulate mitochondrial metabolism through PDK inhibition and its extensive use in related metabolic disorders. The strengths of its robust mechanism of action, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and deep clinical experience in analogous conditions provide a compelling rationale for further exploration in FRDA. However, addressing its toxicity profile and variability in drug metabolism will be critical in optimizing its therapeutic window for FRDA. In summary, while challenges remain—particularly with respect to neuropathic side effects and the need for direct FRDA-related data—the molecular and clinical evidence supports the continued preclinical assessment and eventual clinical trial evaluation of DCA as a promising therapeutic strategy to restore mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in FRDA patient-derived neurons (Stacpoole et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2023; Kankotia & Stacpoole, 2014).

Sulforaphane (Cayman Cat#10005594),"Proposal for Sulforaphane (Cayman Cat#10005594)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate originally discovered in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower. It is typically extracted from broccoli sprouts and is available commercially (e.g., Cayman Cat#10005594). As an isothiocyanate, sulforaphane belongs to a class of phytochemicals that have garnered widespread attention for their chemopreventive, antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. This compound was initially identified through epidemiological studies linking high consumption of cruciferous vegetables to lower incidences of cancer. Over time, its potent ability to modulate redox-sensitive pathways has been increasingly appreciated in the context of neurological and mitochondrial disorders. In general, compounds of this class have been used both as dietary supplements and as lead candidates in drug development pipelines targeting oxidative stress–associated pathologies (Ding & Klomparens, 2019; Yang et al., 2025).

Therapeutic History:
Sulforaphane has an extensive preclinical history in the context of neurodegenerative and mitochondrial disorders. Multiple investigations have documented its beneficial effects in cellular models by attenuating oxidative stress, reducing the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and restoring mitochondrial function. In particular, sulforaphane has been shown to increase the expression of the transcription factor NRF2 and its target antioxidant enzymes such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and γ-glutamyl cysteine ligase (GCL). In a specific study focusing on neurological disorders, sulforaphane was demonstrated to increase NRF2 DNA binding through disruption of its inhibitory partner KEAP1, leading to upregulation of phase II detoxifying enzymes (Chang & Chen, 2024; Petrillo et al., 2017). Moreover, in models of Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) and related mitochondrial diseases, sulforaphane has been reported to not only activate NRF2 signaling but also to increase frataxin mRNA levels in patient-derived fibroblasts; such an effect would be critically important given that FRDA is characterized by frataxin deficiency and consequent mitochondrial dysfunction (Lew et al., 2022; Petrillo et al., 2019). Although the compound’s use in clinical trials for FRDA has not been as extensively documented as for some other diseases, its success in similar models and its favorable safety profile have rendered it a promising candidate for repurposing toward FRDA therapy (Keita et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
The principal mechanism of action of sulforaphane is its ability to activate the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway. Normally, NRF2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which targets NRF2 for proteasomal degradation. Sulforaphane covalently modifies key cysteine residues in KEAP1—particularly Cys151—thereby altering its conformation and preventing it from binding NRF2. This disruption allows NRF2 to stabilize and translocate into the nucleus, where it binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) present in the promoter regions of various phase II detoxifying and antioxidant genes (Petrillo et al., 2017; La Rosa et al., 2020). Once in the nucleus, NRF2 forms complexes with small Maf proteins and drives the expression of genes including NQO1, HO-1, superoxide dismutase isoforms (SOD1 and SOD2), and enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis and regeneration such as GCL, ultimately contributing to cellular defense against oxidative stress. In addition to its canonical role via KEAP1 modification, sulforaphane may also influence the epigenetic regulation of the NRF2 gene itself by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs), further potentiating NRF2-mediated transcriptional responses (Lew et al., 2022; Petrillo et al., 2017). Such dual activity—both alleviating the inhibitory effects of KEAP1 and modulating epigenetic regulators—underscores the compound’s robust ability to enhance cellular antioxidant capacity. This multifaceted activation of NRF2 has been observed to restore mitochondrial coupling efficiency and augment ATP production in various cellular models, thereby mitigating the energy deficits which are hallmarks of mitochondrial diseases, including FRDA (Ding & Klomparens, 2019; La Rosa et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for using sulforaphane in FRDA is that it will induce NRF2 nuclear translocation in FRDA fibroblasts. This NRF2 activation is expected to upregulate a suite of phase II detoxifying enzymes, such as NQO1, HO-1, and glutathione-synthesizing enzymes, which in turn would mitigate ROS-mediated damage. In FRDA, where frataxin deficiency leads to impaired mitochondrial function and enhanced oxidative stress, these actions are critically important. By normalizing aspects of mitochondrial function—specifically mitochondrial coupling efficiency and ATP production—sulforaphane is anticipated to improve cellular bioenergetics. There are reports that, in FRDA patient cells, sulforaphane treatment increases frataxin mRNA levels via engagement of the NRF2–ARE system, which is significant given that even modest upregulation of frataxin can have a therapeutic benefit (Petrillo et al., 2019; Lew et al., 2022). Additionally, by reducing the accumulation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and restoring reduced glutathione (GSH) content, the compound is expected to rebalance the redox state of the cells (Petrillo et al., 2017; Seco-Cervera et al., 2020). The convergence of enhanced antioxidant enzyme expression and the normalization of intracellular redox homeostasis should help mitigate the mitochondrial dysfunction and ensuing energy deficits critical in the pathogenesis of FRDA (Chang & Chen, 2024; La Rosa et al., 2020). In the proposed assay using patient-derived FRDA fibroblasts, one would expect an observable increase in nuclear NRF2, upregulation of downstream antioxidant gene transcripts, a reduction in markers of oxidative damage, and improved mitochondrial function metrics such as oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and ATP production (Lew et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Sulforaphane presents a promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on several converging lines of evidence. One of its greatest strengths lies in its natural origin and established safety profile. The fact that it is a dietary constituent and has been widely consumed in the form of cruciferous vegetables reduces the barrier to clinical translation and supports its potential use as a nutraceutical or adjunct to other therapies (Yang et al., 2025; Ding & Klomparens, 2019). Its robust mechanism of NRF2 activation, mediated through covalent modification of KEAP1 and potential epigenetic modulation, is well documented and offers a multi-target approach to attenuate oxidative stress—a central pathological process in FRDA (Petrillo et al., 2017; La Rosa et al., 2020). The expected biological effects—increased expression of antioxidant genes, restoration of redox balance, and normalization of mitochondrial function—address the major cellular deficits in FRDA patient cells. Furthermore, sulforaphane has been shown in preclinical studies to upregulate frataxin mRNA levels, which could translate into clinically meaningful improvements given the critical roles of frataxin in mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis and energy metabolism (Lew et al., 2022; Petrillo et al., 2019).

However, there are challenges and weaknesses that must be considered. Although preclinical data are very promising, clinical validation specifically in FRDA patients is still limited. The pharmacokinetic limitations of sulforaphane, such as its relatively poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability, may impede its effectiveness in vivo unless overcome by novel formulation strategies or improved delivery systems (Chang & Chen, 2024; Rufini et al., 2022). Moreover, while activation of the NRF2 pathway is critical for combating oxidative stress, this pathway is complex and tightly regulated, and there is always concern about potential off-target effects or unintended consequences of chronic NRF2 activation. The interplay between NRF2 and other signaling pathways could lead to variability in patient responses, particularly in a disease as multifactorial as FRDA (Petrillo et al., 2017; Tiberi et al., 2023). Another potential limitation is the indirect nature of its action on frataxin expression; while sulforaphane may increase frataxin mRNA levels via NRF2–ARE engagement, the overall impact on frataxin protein levels and functional activity within mitochondria remains to be definitively demonstrated (Lew et al., 2022; Petrillo et al., 2019). Lastly, the translation from preclinical models such as fibroblasts and neuronal cell lines to clinical efficacy in patients with FRDA is fraught with challenges, including differences in disease severity, patient heterogeneity, and the proper timing and dosing of the intervention (Keita et al., 2022; Strawser et al., 2017).

In summary, the overall evaluation of sulforaphane as a therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia is encouraging. The compound’s natural derivation, favorable safety profile, and well-characterized mechanism of NRF2 activation all support its potential to mitigate oxidative damage and improve mitochondrial function—a therapeutic strategy that directly addresses key aspects of FRDA pathology. However, to ensure a successful transition from bench to bedside, further studies must focus on optimizing its bioavailability, verifying its effects on frataxin protein levels in relevant FRDA models, and establishing robust clinical endpoints. The convergence of biochemical data and preclinical models suggests that, if formulation and delivery challenges can be overcome, sulforaphane might offer a viable approach to improve mitochondrial coupling efficiency, reduce ROS accumulation, and enhance ATP production in FRDA patients, thereby slowing or potentially halting disease progression (Chang & Chen, 2024; Petrillo et al., 2019; La Rosa et al., 2020). Overall, sulforaphane stands out as a promising repurposed drug candidate for FRDA, meriting further detailed investigation in targeted preclinical and eventual clinical studies.

Compound A3 (SUV4-20 H1 Analogue),"Proposal for Compound A3 (SUV4-20 H1 Analogue)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Compound A3 is a rationally engineered, synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor designed to target SUV4-20 H1, a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes the di- and tri-methylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me2/3). The compound emerged as a next-generation analogue derived from the parent epigenetic chemical probe A-196, originally identified by the Structural Genomics Consortium and further characterized in several preclinical studies focused on Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) models. The discovery process involved extensive structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies and crystal structure–based design, with modifications on the cyclopentyl moiety (often reconfigured into restricted bicyclic systems) and the incorporation of optimized heterocyclic substituents to enhance potency, cellular permeability, and metabolic stability. Unlike classical drug modalities, this class of epigenetic modulators functions by altering chromatin architecture via the targeted inhibition of enzymes that deposit repressive histone marks, and compounds in this chemical series have seen broad utility as chemical probes in oncology and neurodegenerative disorders. In the context of FRDA, where epigenetic repression of the frataxin (FXN) gene is a central pathological feature, Compound A3 is positioned as a highly specific agent designed to reverse the silencing of FXN by inhibiting SUV4-20 H1 activity and thereby restoring a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state (Quinlan, 2021; Enriquez, 2018).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic approach underlying Compound A3 is relatively recent and builds upon a growing body of preclinical evidence generated with the parent compound A-196. FRDA is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder caused by a GAA triplet expansion in the first intron of the FXN gene, which establishes an epigenetically repressive chromatin environment characterized by an increase in repressive marks such as H4K20me2 and H4K20me3. Early studies demonstrated that inhibition of the SUV4-20 family, particularly via A-196, led to a modest increase (approximately 1.5- to 2-fold) in FXN protein levels in patient-derived fibroblasts and FXN-GAA-Luc reporter cell lines (Vilema-Enríquez et al., 2020; Enriquez, 2018). However, despite these promising results, A-196 was limited by suboptimal ADME properties, including rapid metabolism and limited in vivo bioavailability. Consequently, medicinal chemistry efforts were directed toward the optimization of this chemical series, giving rise to advanced analogues such as Compound A3. Although Compound A3 has not yet been evaluated in clinical trials or veterinary settings, its development is rooted in the successful preclinical repurposing of epigenetic inhibitors for FRDA – an approach that has shown potential in restoring FXN expression in cellular systems. Moreover, while methyltransferase inhibitors have been widely explored in oncology as modulators of aberrant gene expression, their application in FRDA is novel; epigenetic therapy for FRDA is still in the preclinical phase with compounds like A-196 and its derivatives spearheading the effort (Vilema-Enríquez et al., 2020; Enriquez, 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Compound A3 is designed to inhibit SUV4-20 H1 with high potency and selectivity, thereby directly modulating the epigenetic landscape at the FXN gene locus. SUV4-20 H1 is a member of the SET-domain methyltransferase family that catalyzes the conversion of histone H4 lysine 20 from its mono-methylated state (H4K20me1) into the more repressive di- and tri-methylated forms (H4K20me2/3). In FRDA, the presence of expanded GAA repeats is accompanied by an abnormal enrichment of these repressive marks, which reinforces heterochromatin formation and suppresses transcription of the FXN gene (Enriquez, 2018). Compound A3’s mechanism of action, therefore, involves the direct binding to the catalytic pocket of SUV4-20 H1, preventing the enzyme from executing further methylation of H4K20. Structural studies have revealed that inhibitors like A-196 engage the SUV4-20 catalytic domain via a combination of hydrophobic interactions and critical hydrogen bonds. In particular, the cyclopentyl group—modified in A3 to adopt a bicyclic or conformationally constrained format—fits into a defined hydrophobic pocket formed by residues such as Met253, Trp264, and Phe281, while additional polar substituents facilitate hydrogen bonding with active-site water molecules and amino acid side chains (Quinlan, 2021; Enriquez, 2018). By reducing the deposits of H4K20me2/3, Compound A3 shifts the balance toward an increased relative level of H4K20me1, a histone state that is more permissive for transcription initiation. This alleviation of epigenetic repression is hypothesized to result in the derepression of the FXN gene, transcriptional upregulation of frataxin mRNA, and eventual restoration of FXN protein levels. The restored frataxin, in turn, is crucial for the assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters that are essential for mitochondrial enzyme function and efficient oxidative phosphorylation (Enriquez, 2018; Vilema-Enríquez et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
The primary expected outcome of using Compound A3 in FRDA patient cells, as evaluated in preclinical in vitro assays such as the FXN-GAA-Luc reporter system and patient-derived fibroblasts, is a significant increase in FXN expression relative to untreated controls and even relative to treatment with A-196. Reports indicate that modest increases in frataxin—on the order of 1.5- to 2-fold—are clinically significant given that asymptomatic heterozygous carriers of the FXN mutation express approximately 50% of normal frataxin levels (Vilema-Enríquez et al., 2020; Enriquez, 2018). In this context, Compound A3, with reported EC50 values as low as 0.21 µM in some assays, is anticipated to drive a more robust upregulation of FXN mRNA and protein in FRDA cells. This elevated expression should help restore the normal function of iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes, which are critical for mitochondrial bioenergetics, as frataxin is essential for Fe-S cluster biogenesis. Thus, the expected effects of Compound A3 include not only increased frataxin levels but also functional improvements at the mitochondrial level, such as normalized oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and augmented ATP production, which are essential for ameliorating the metabolic deficits observed in FRDA (Quinlan, 2021).

Additionally, favorable in vitro ADME properties have been reported for related derivatives in the series, suggesting that Compound A3 may possess improved metabolic stability and cell permeability compared to the parental A-196. Such enhancements are critical for achieving sustained therapeutic concentrations, especially given the previous challenges with rapid metabolism and suboptimal bioavailability found in early compounds. Improvements in CNS multiparameter optimization (MPO) scores further support the likelihood that Compound A3 may cross the blood–brain barrier, targeting affected neural tissues in FRDA patients (Quinlan, 2021). These pharmacokinetic advantages, alongside the potent epigenetic modulation of the SUV4-20 H1 pathway, provide a solid biochemical rationale for expecting Compound A3 to not only increase FXN expression but also to yield downstream improvements in mitochondrial function and overall cellular bioenergetics.

Overall Evaluation:
Compound A3 stands out as a highly promising candidate for the treatment of Friedreich’s Ataxia due to several compelling factors. First, its design leverages rational, crystal structure–guided medicinal chemistry to overcome the limitations of its predecessor, A-196. The improvements in potency—documented by significantly lower effective concentrations—and enhanced cell permeability and metabolic stability address key hurdles encountered in earlier iterations of SUV4-20 inhibitors. Increasing the potency and improving the ADME profile of Compound A3 suggest that it could achieve sustained therapeutic levels in vitro and, potentially, in vivo, which is critical for disease-modifying effects in a condition like FRDA (Quinlan, 2021).

The mechanistic rationale for targeting SUV4-20 H1 in FRDA is robust and well-supported by genetic and biochemical studies. SUV4-20 H1 has been implicated in the epigenetic silencing of the FXN gene through the deposition of repressive H4K20me2/3 marks. Inhibition of this enzyme with compounds such as A-196—and, by extension, Compound A3—leads to a shift in the chromatin state toward increased H4K20me1, which is associated with a more open and transcriptionally active chromatin configuration. This précis, underpinned by detailed structural studies that outline the critical interactions within the SUV4-20 active site, supports the hypothesis that Compound A3’s superior binding affinity and improved pharmacodynamic profile will translate into more effective derepression of the FXN gene (Enriquez, 2018; Quinlan, 2021).

From the therapeutic history perspective, while initial efforts with A-196 demonstrated a modest 1.5- to 2-fold increase in FXN expression, this level of upregulation is particularly noteworthy given that heterozygous carriers with roughly 50% frataxin expression do not manifest the severe clinical phenotype observed in FRDA. In this light, any compound that can reliably elevate FXN levels by a similar or greater magnitude is of significant potential therapeutic benefit. Compound A3, by virtue of its enhanced potency (with EC50 values reported as low as 0.21 µM in some assays) and its optimization for improved ADME characteristics, represents an evolution in the series that may overcome prior limitations and offer a more robust approach to reversing FXN gene silencing (Vilema-Enríquez et al., 2020; Enriquez, 2018).

In terms of the expected biological and clinical effects, the reduction of repressive histone marks at the FXN locus should lead to increased transcription and translation of frataxin, which is foundational for the restoration of mitochondrial function. Frataxin is essential for the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters required for the activity of various mitochondrial enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, an increase in frataxin levels is expected to support the normalization of mitochondrial bioenergetics, reflected by improvements in parameters such as oxygen consumption rate and ATP generation. These functional improvements at the mitochondrial level have been conceptually validated in preclinical models using earlier compounds and further provide a strong rationale for advancing Compound A3 into in vivo studies (Quinlan, 2021).

Despite these strong points, several challenges remain that warrant careful evaluation as Compound A3 moves forward in the development pipeline. Notably, while in vitro data are promising, the degree of frataxin upregulation must be consistent across different patient-derived cell lines and ultimately in animal models that recapitulate the complex tissue-specific pathology of FRDA. Inter-patient variability in response could impact the clinical efficacy of the compound. Moreover, while epigenetic therapies benefit from the potential to reverse gene silencing, they inherently carry the risk of off-target effects and broader transcriptional perturbations. Although early transcriptomic studies with compounds like A-196 have shown a relatively limited impact on the global gene expression profile compared to nonselective HDAC inhibitors, long-term studies will be necessary to ensure that chronic administration of Compound A3 does not compromise genomic integrity or induce unintended epigenetic shifts (Enriquez, 2018; Quinlan, 2021).

Another critical area of concern is the successful translation of in vitro pharmacokinetic improvements to in vivo efficacy. Preclinical animal studies will need to confirm that the favorable ADME and cell permeability characteristics observed in vitro result in sustained and therapeutically relevant concentrations in target tissues, including the central nervous system, heart, and skeletal muscle. Given that FRDA is a multisystem disorder with pronounced neurological and cardiac involvement, the ability of Compound A3 to penetrate these end organs will be a key determinant of its clinical utility (Quinlan, 2021).

Long-term safety is paramount, particularly in the case of epigenetic modulators where off-target inhibition of related methyltransferases or excessive disruption of global histone methylation patterns could potentially lead to adverse outcomes such as genomic instability or impaired DNA repair. A comprehensive preclinical safety evaluation, including both acute and chronic dosing studies, will be essential to mitigate these risks. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape for novel epigenetic therapies is complex, and the design of clinical trials – including the selection of appropriate biomarkers for frataxin expression, mitochondrial function, and clinical endpoints – will require careful planning and rigorous validation.

In summary, Compound A3 emerges as a promising candidate for FRDA based on its enhanced potency relative to A-196, improved ADME and pharmacokinetic properties, and a well-defined mechanism of action that targets the core epigenetic defects underlying FXN gene silencing. The compound’s ability to decrease repressive H4K20me2/3 marks and promote a more permissive chromatin state at the FXN locus is supported by robust structural and biochemical data, and the anticipated biological outcomes – including normalization of mitochondrial bioenergetics and restoration of Fe-S cluster enzyme activities – align with established pathophysiological mechanisms in FRDA.

Key strengths of Compound A3 include its high target selectivity achieved via structure-based design, its improved cell permeability and metabolic stability that can potentially ensure sustained therapeutic exposure, and its capacity to induce frataxin upregulation to levels that may be clinically beneficial (Quinlan, 2021; Enriquez, 2018). Moreover, the preclinical evidence – derived from FXN-GAA-Luc reporter assays and patient-derived fibroblast studies – strongly supports the mechanistic hypothesis that reversing SUV4-20 H1–mediated epigenetic repression can ameliorate the mitochondrial dysfunction characteristic of FRDA. This represents a significant step forward in translating epigenetic modulation into a disease‐modifying therapeutic strategy for a condition that currently lacks effective treatment options.

On the other hand, potential weaknesses include the modest degree of FXN upregulation observed with earlier compounds, which may need to be further amplified in vivo, and the inherent risks associated with chronic epigenetic modulation that could lead to off-target effects over extended treatment periods. Additionally, there is a critical need to validate that the favorable in vitro ADME and pharmacokinetic profiles of Compound A3 are maintained in animal models, and ultimately, in human subjects. Finally, successful clinical translation will depend on overcoming regulatory challenges associated with novel therapeutic classes in a rare disease context, which may necessitate comprehensive biomarker-driven trial designs and long-term safety assessments (Enriquez, 2018; Quinlan, 2021).

Overall, based on the extensive preclinical evaluation documented in the literature—highlighting robust SAR studies, crystal structure–guided design insights, and favorable in vitro biological effects—Compound A3 appears to be a highly promising candidate for advancing the therapeutic strategy of SUV4-20 H1 inhibition in Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its enhanced potency, superior pharmacokinetic attributes, and clear mechanistic rationale for restoring FXN expression and improving mitochondrial function support its further preclinical development. As long as the challenges of ensuring consistent in vivo efficacy and long-term safety are addressed through rigorous preclinical and eventual clinical studies, Compound A3 could represent a transformative disease‐modifying therapy for FRDA, potentially altering the natural course of this debilitating mitochondrial disorder (Quinlan, 2021; Enriquez, 2018).

Rapamycin,"Proposal for Rapamycin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rapamycin is a naturally occurring lipophilic macrolide originally isolated from the bacterium *Streptomyces hygroscopicus*. Initially discovered for its antifungal properties, rapamycin was later found to have potent immunosuppressive and antiproliferative activities. It belongs to the class of mTOR inhibitors and is most commonly classified as an allosteric inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). The compound was synthesized and characterized following its discovery in environmental samples, and its structure–activity relationships have been extensively explored. Over the years, rapamycin has been employed in diverse clinical contexts—most notably as an immunosuppressant in organ transplantation and as an agent to prevent restenosis after coronary interventions. In recent decades, its potential as an anti-aging agent and neuroprotective therapy has garnered significant attention. This class of compounds has historically been used to modulate nutrient-sensing pathways, regulate protein synthesis, and induce autophagy, making rapamycin a particularly attractive candidate for diseases with underlying mitochondrial dysfunction and proteostatic stress (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2009).

Therapeutic History:
Rapamycin has a robust therapeutic history. Clinically, it is FDA-approved as an immunosuppressant for preventing organ transplant rejection and has been utilized in oncology due to its antiproliferative properties. Its use has extended into experimental models of neurodegeneration where it has demonstrated neuroprotective effects, largely attributed to its ability to promote autophagy and clear misfolded or aggregated proteins. Preclinical studies in neurodegenerative contexts—including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease models—have shown that rapamycin ameliorates cellular stress by enhancing cellular recycling processes (Pan et al., 2009; Wong, 2013). Specifically for Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA), clinical trial databases indicate that no direct clinical trials with rapamycin have been conducted to date (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, compelling preclinical evidence exists in Drosophila models of FRDA, where rapamycin-mediated inhibition of TORC1 improved motor performance, increased lifespan, reduced oxidative damage markers, and improved mitochondrial function (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015). Moreover, in frataxin-deficient yeast models, rapamycin treatment reduced oxidative stress via enhanced mitophagy and clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria (Marobbio et al., 2012). Thus, while rapamycin has not been directly tested in FRDA patients, its efficacy in related models of mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration provides a strong rationale for its repurposing.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, rapamycin exerts its biological effect by forming a complex with the intracellular receptor FKBP12, which then binds to and inhibits mTORC1. mTORC1 is a serine/threonine kinase that integrates signals from nutrients, growth factors, and cellular energy status to regulate protein synthesis, lipid biosynthesis, and autophagy. Under normal conditions, active mTORC1 phosphorylates downstream targets such as S6 kinase (S6K) and the eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BP), thereby promoting protein synthesis and inhibiting autophagy. Rapamycin’s binding to FKBP12 interferes with the kinase activity of mTORC1, leading to dephosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP, which in turn promotes the induction of autophagy and, more specifically, mitophagy—the selective clearance of damaged mitochondria (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015; Marobbio et al., 2012). In models of FRDA, where frataxin deficiency leads to impaired iron–sulfur cluster synthesis, mitochondrial iron overload, and oxidative stress, these processes contribute to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. By activating autophagy, rapamycin enhances mitochondrial quality control, reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and may improve mitochondrial membrane potential and spare respiratory capacity. Evidence in Drosophila FRDA models supports the notion that the neuroprotective effects of rapamycin are mediated not solely through autophagy induction under normoxic conditions but also via improved ATP availability through modulation of translation regulators such as 4E-BP (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015). This mechanistic detail is further reinforced by studies indicating that mTOR inhibition can lead to enhanced nuclear translocation of antioxidant transcription factors (e.g., cap-n-collar, the Drosophila ortholog of Nrf2), thereby upregulating the expression of antioxidant genes and mitigating oxidative stress (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015). Additionally, preclinical work in yeast models has shown that rapamycin treatment results in reduced mitochondrial mass and decreased protein carbonylation, pointing to its effectiveness in reducing oxidative damage (Marobbio et al., 2012).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis posits that in FRDA patient-derived fibroblasts, rapamycin will inhibit mTORC1 signaling, which is anticipated to trigger a cascade of beneficial cellular processes. First, the inhibition of mTORC1 is expected to relieve its repression on autophagy. As a result, autophagic flux, and in particular mitophagy, should be enhanced. This will promote the clearance of damaged mitochondria, resulting in improved mitochondrial quality control and a reduction in accumulated oxidative damage. Restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential is anticipated due to the reduction in ROS levels and the removal of defective mitochondria, which compromises normal electron transport chain function. Consequently, these effects should normalize oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and bolster ATP production as functional mitochondria repopulate the cellular environment. Supporting evidence in Drosophila models of FRDA showed that rapamycin treatment normalized markers of lipid peroxidation such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxyalkenals, as well as total glutathione levels, which are reflective of improved oxidative stress parameters (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015). In parallel, studies in yeast models have demonstrated that rapamycin reduces ROS production and decreases mitochondrial mass, further indicating a remodeling of mitochondrial turnover (Marobbio et al., 2012). At the molecular level within FRDA fibroblasts, enhanced autophagic clearance should also be accompanied by restoration of mitochondrial biogenesis pathways, leading to an increase in spare respiratory capacity—a critical metric for cellular resilience under metabolic stress. Hence, rapamycin is expected to exert its beneficial effects by simultaneously reducing oxidative burden, enhancing mitochondrial dynamics, and promoting overall cellular energy homeostasis. This expectation is underpinned by the extensive preclinical literature demonstrating the neuroprotective and mitochondria-preserving effects of rapamycin in various models of mitochondrial and neurodegenerative disease (Pan et al., 2009; Calap-Quintana et al., 2015).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of rapamycin as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia is cautiously optimistic. One of the greatest strengths of rapamycin is its extensive preclinical and clinical record in other diseases, which provides a well-characterized safety and dosing profile. Its established ability to inhibit mTORC1 and induce autophagy and mitophagy positions it favorably for conditions like FRDA, where mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are central to pathology (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015; Marobbio et al., 2012). Preclinical models, particularly the Drosophila FRDA studies, offer encouraging data with improvements seen in motor function, lifespan, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress markers. This mechanistic consistency across different species and models underscores the biological plausibility that rapamycin could restore mitochondrial integrity in FRDA patient-derived cells. Moreover, the molecular interactions of rapamycin—namely its inhibition of mTORC1 via FKBP12—and its downstream effects on translation regulators and autophagy pathways have been rigorously detailed in the literature, lending strong support to the hypothesis that rapamycin will enhance mitochondrial quality control in FRDA (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015; Marobbio et al., 2012).

However, there are notable weaknesses and considerations that require further investigation. First, despite promising preclinical data, there is yet to be any direct clinical trial evidence of rapamycin’s efficacy in treating FRDA (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This gap in clinical data means that the translation of animal model results to human patients remains speculative. Additionally, some studies, such as those investigating the effects of diazoxide on frataxin expression, have highlighted that mTOR signaling can have a dual role; in certain contexts, mTOR activity appears necessary for the optimal expression of frataxin (Santoro et al., 2018). In such cases, the inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin could theoretically downregulate frataxin expression—a protein already deficient in FRDA—which might counteract some of its beneficial effects on mitochondrial turnover. Thus, the dosing regimen and target specificity of rapamycin will be critical to maximize its mitophagy-promoting and antioxidant-enhancing properties without inadvertently suppressing frataxin levels further. Another potential concern is the immunosuppressive effect of rapamycin, which, although well-characterized in transplant and oncology settings, could pose risks for long-term treatment in a chronic neurodegenerative disease. Nevertheless, the cumulative preclinical evidence suggests that at carefully titrated doses, rapamycin could strike a balance between efficacy and tolerability, especially with the possibility of intermittent dosing protocols that have been shown to extend lifespan and improve healthspan in other models (Siegmund et al., 2017; Harinath et al., 2024).

In summary, rapamycin has strong potential as a repurposed drug for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on its molecular mechanism of mTORC1 inhibition, which is expected to enhance autophagy and mitophagy, thereby clearing damaged mitochondria and reducing oxidative stress—a central pathology in FRDA. Its extensive therapeutic history in other indications underpins its favorable safety profile, and preclinical models have already demonstrated improvements in mitochondrial quality control with rapamycin treatment. However, the complexity of mTOR’s role in regulating frataxin expression and the necessity for precise dosing remain significant challenges that warrant further targeted studies in FRDA-specific models and patient-derived cells before progressing to clinical trials. Overall, while there is a strong mechanistic rationale and promising preclinical data supporting rapamycin’s use in FRDA, additional research is required to optimize its application and fully ascertain its therapeutic value in this context (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015; Marobbio et al., 2012; Pan et al., 2009).

Below is a detailed evaluation of metformin as a candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia, organized into the required sections.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Metformin is a synthetic agent from the biguanide class that was designed based on natural observations of the glucose‐lowering effects of compounds present in Galega officinalis. Early work identified that extracts from this plant, which contains the guanidine-derived molecule galegine, were associated with blood glucose reduction. However, because natural guanidines were associated with significant toxicity at therapeutic levels, medicinal chemists synthesized metformin as a dimethyl biguanide in order to combine efficacy with an improved safety profile (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 1–2). Unlike its natural precursor, galegine, metformin exhibits a stable biguanide structure that has been optimized to minimize lactic acidosis and other adverse effects that plagued earlier biguanide agents such as phenformin and buformin (Szymczak-Pajor et al., 2022, pp. 15–16). Chemically, metformin is manufactured by an organic synthetic route that involves the condensation of dimethylamine hydrochloride with cyanoguanidine under controlled conditions, resulting in the formation of the characteristic biguanide functional group (Lv & Guo, 2020, pp. 1–2). Today, metformin belongs to a large class of antidiabetic agents; it is widely prescribed as the first‐line therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) because of its robust antihyperglycemic properties, cost‐effectiveness, and extensive clinical safety record (Zuliani et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; Sportelli et al., 2020, pp. 2–3). In addition to its well‐documented use in T2DM, there is growing interest in repurposing metformin for other indications, including obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and also various neurodegenerative and mitochondrial diseases. Its ability to modulate cellular energetic balance and to affect mitochondrial function makes it a fitting candidate for diseases marked by mitochondrial dysfunction, such as Friedreich’s Ataxia.

Therapeutic History
The history of metformin in clinical medicine spans more than half a century. Initially introduced for diabetes management, metformin rapidly became the most commonly prescribed oral antidiabetic medication worldwide due to its efficacy in lowering blood glucose levels and its low risk of severe hypoglycemia (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 2–3; Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 1–3). In the decades since its introduction, thousands of clinical studies and extensive post-marketing surveillance have established its safety profile, with gastrointestinal disturbances being its most common side effect. Beyond its primary role in T2DM, metformin has been explored extensively in preclinical and clinical settings for its pleiotropic actions. For instance, studies have evaluated metformin’s potential beneficial effects in carcinoma through antiproliferative mechanisms, in cardiovascular disease through improved endothelial function and reduced oxidative stress, and in metabolic syndrome via improvements in insulin sensitivity (Lv & Guo, 2020, pp. 1–2; Du et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). Importantly, metformin’s modulatory effects on mitochondrial function have prompted investigations of its use in several neurodegenerative conditions. In Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease models, metformin has been shown to interact with pathways regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and cell survival (Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 19–20). Despite these numerous trials and experimental applications, a search of clinicaltrials.gov for “metformin Friedreich’s Ataxia” reveals no registered clinical studies specifically targeting Friedreich’s Ataxia with metformin (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nevertheless, the pathogenic features of Friedreich’s Ataxia—namely mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired energy metabolism—overlap significantly with the conditions in which metformin has demonstrated positive effects. This mechanistic overlap supports the ongoing exploration of metformin’s repurposing even in the absence of dedicated FRDA clinical trials (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 22–24; Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 19–20).

Mechanism of Action
Metformin’s pharmacological action is multifaceted, centering on its ability to modulate cellular energy metabolism at the mitochondrial level. The primary mechanism involves metformin’s mild, non-competitive inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory-chain complex I. This inhibition leads to a modest reduction in mitochondrial ATP production and, as a consequence, an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio. Such a shift in energy balance serves as a cellular signal for energy stress (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 3–5; Szymczak-Pajor et al., 2022, pp. 8–9). Cells respond to this elevated AMP/ATP ratio by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of energy homeostasis. Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates a host of downstream targets that inhibit anabolic processes while promoting catabolic pathways to restore energy balance; these targets include acetyl-CoA carboxylase and various transcription factors that regulate lipid and glucose metabolism (Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 3–4; Li et al., 2022, p. 13).

An essential mediator downstream of AMPK activation is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α), a transcriptional coactivator that serves as a “master regulator” of mitochondrial biogenesis. Activation of PGC-1α induces the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial replication, respiratory chain assembly, and antioxidant defense, thereby increasing mitochondrial quality and capacity (Rius-Pérez et al., 2020, p. 20). In addition to the canonical AMPK-dependent pathway, metformin also exerts effects via alternative, AMP-independent mechanisms. Recent studies have elucidated that metformin can interact with lysosomal proteins, such as presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), to activate AMPK via a lysosome-dependent pathway that does not require a change in the AMP/ATP ratio (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 5–8).

Furthermore, metformin’s action on mitochondrial complex I not only reduces ATP production but also alters the NADH/NAD⁺ ratio. This change in redox balance can directly influence the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under normal conditions, mitochondrial electron leakage from complex I is a significant source of ROS; by mildly inhibiting complex I, metformin potentially reduces this electron leakage and thereby diminishes ROS generation (Szymczak-Pajor et al., 2022, pp. 5–6; Li et al., 2022, pp. 7–8). This dual impact—simultaneous stimulation of compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis through AMPK/PGC-1α and reduction of oxidative stress through attenuated ROS production—is central to metformin’s broad metabolic and cytoprotective actions observed in numerous preclinical models.

Expected Effect in Friedreich’s Ataxia
Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) is a mitochondrial disorder that arises from deficiency of frataxin, a protein critical for iron-sulfur cluster assembly in mitochondria. This deficiency disrupts normal mitochondrial homeostasis, leading to impaired oxidative phosphorylation, increased ROS, and progressive neurodegeneration in affected tissues, particularly in the nervous system and the heart. The hypothesis behind repurposing metformin for FRDA is that low-dose metformin would exert a carefully balanced inhibition of complex I in FRDA cells. Such inhibition is expected to promote a modest reduction in ATP production that is sufficient to elevate the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio without precipitating a severe energy crisis—a delicate balance particularly crucial in cells already stressed by frataxin deficiency (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 22–24; Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 6–8).

This increase in AMP is anticipated to robustly activate AMPK, which then triggers a cascade of downstream events including the upregulation of PGC-1α. As PGC-1α is critical for mitochondrial biogenesis, its upregulation is predicted to drive the generation of new, functional mitochondria and the clearance of damaged ones via mitophagy. The overall effect should be an improvement in the quality of the mitochondrial pool in FRDA cells, better coupling of oxidative phosphorylation, and a reduction in the excessive ROS production that contributes to cellular damage (Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Li et al., 2022, pp. 7–8).

In preclinical studies using other neurodegenerative or mitochondrial disease models—including models of Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases—metformin has demonstrated the ability to restore mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and improve cellular bioenergetics (Du et al., 2022, pp. 3–5). In such models, the normalization of OCR correlates with improved neuronal viability and function, suggesting that similar benefits might also be observed in FRDA. The expectation in FRDA-specific assays, particularly those using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons, is that metformin treatment will lead to a measurable improvement in mitochondrial coupling efficiency, as evidenced by a restored balance between ATP generation and ROS production. Furthermore, given that frataxin is expressed in neuronal tissue where mitochondrial impairment is central to pathology, enhancing mitochondrial turnover through the AMPK/PGC-1α axis could directly counteract the bioenergetic deficiencies that underlie the progressive neurodegeneration observed in FRDA (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 22–24; Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 16–17).

Overall, if metformin’s dual mechanism—combining mild complex I inhibition with robust AMPK activation—can be titrated precisely in FRDA cells, it is expected that this will trigger compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis and mitigate the excessive oxidative stress that contributes to the ataxic phenotype. Such normalization of mitochondrial function would theoretically improve cellular survival, neuronal function, and ultimately slow the progression of neurodegeneration characteristic of Friedreich’s Ataxia.

Overall Evaluation
Metformin possesses considerable promise as a candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia. One of its strongest assets is its extensive clinical history in type 2 diabetes mellitus. With decades of data affirming its safety, well-known pharmacokinetics, and cost-effectiveness, metformin minimizes many of the risks associated with new drug development. Its robust record as an antidiabetic agent provides a significant translational advantage because the dosing, tissue distribution, and adverse event profile are well characterized (Zuliani et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; Sportelli et al., 2020, pp. 2–3).

From a mechanistic perspective, metformin directly addresses several pathological aspects of Friedreich’s Ataxia. The disease is characterized by impaired mitochondrial function stemming from frataxin deficiency, which leads to both a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation efficiency and an increase in ROS production. Metformin’s principal mechanism of moderately inhibiting complex I and elevating the AMP/ATP ratio can trigger AMPK-dependent signaling cascades that facilitate mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover through the upregulation of PGC-1α (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 3–5; Rius-Pérez et al., 2020, p. 20). This, in turn, promises to improve mitochondrial quality and reduce the damaging burden of oxidative stress—a central pathological mechanism in FRDA (Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Li et al., 2022, pp. 7–8).

Despite these attractive features, several noteworthy challenges must be considered. First, while the preclinical data for metformin’s action on mitochondrial metabolism are extensive in models of diabetes and neurodegeneration (e.g., Parkinson’s and Huntington’s), direct evidence for its efficacy in Friedreich’s Ataxia models is currently lacking. A search of clinical trial databases indicates no registered studies examining metformin specifically in FRDA (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The unique mitochondrial stress already present in frataxin-deficient neurons may render them particularly sensitive to further inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, dosing will need to be very carefully optimized; too high a dose might exacerbate energy deficits, while too low a dose may not sufficiently trigger the compensatory mechanisms needed to enhance mitochondrial quality (Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Li et al., 2022, pp. 7–8).

Another challenge lies in the complexity of AMPK signaling in neuronal cells. Although AMPK activation has consistently been associated with beneficial effects in many cell types, the downstream responses in neurons—especially in a disease context like FRDA that is characterized by profound mitochondrial impairment—might differ from those observed in hepatocytes or muscle cells. Neuronal metabolic responses are inherently more fragile; thus, the heterogeneity in AMPK activation and its potential off-target effects might result in variable responses that complicate dose titration. Moreover, while alternative AMP-independent mechanisms (such as those mediated by PEN2 at the lysosomal membrane) have been described, it remains unclear whether these pathways are fully functional in the neuronal contexts relevant to FRDA (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 5–8).

A further point of consideration is that while metformin does reduce ROS production by attenuating mitochondrial electron leakage, persistent mild inhibition of complex I might limit overall ATP production in cells that are already energetically compromised by frataxin deficiency. In such a scenario, even if AMPK is activated and mitochondrial biogenesis occurs, the net energy output may not be sufficient to reverse the bioenergetic deficit. Thus, extensive preclinical studies in FRDA-specific models—such as frataxin-deficient iPSC-derived neurons or animal models that recapitulate the mitochondrial dysfunction seen in FRDA—will be essential to define the therapeutic window (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 22–24; Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 6–8).

On the other hand, the wealth of data supporting metformin’s impact on energy metabolism and redox homeostasis significantly strengthens its candidacy. Several studies conducted in diverse biological systems have demonstrated that metformin’s modulation of the NADH/NAD⁺ ratio and its effects on mitochondrial coupling correlate with improved cellular function and survival. For example, in preclinical models of neurodegeneration, metformin’s ability to restore oxygen consumption rates and reduce oxidative stress has been linked with neuroprotection and improved motor function (Du et al., 2022, pp. 3–5). Although these models are not identical to Friedreich’s Ataxia, they underscore the potential for metformin to correct energetic deficits in cells under mitochondrial stress. In FRDA, where defective iron-sulfur cluster formation compromises multiple enzymatic systems of the mitochondria, the possibility that metformin could favorably reprogram cellular energy metabolism is particularly appealing.

It is also important to emphasize that metformin’s extensive clinical use implies that many aspects of its pharmacokinetics and tolerability are well understood. This alone could facilitate a rapid transition from preclinical validation to clinical trials, provided that further studies confirm that a carefully titrated dose can trigger the desired compensatory responses in FRDA cells without imposing undue energetic stress. The prospect of repurposing an already approved and inexpensive drug is highly attractive in the context of a rare disease such as Friedreich’s Ataxia, where the cost and risk associated with novel drug development are significant barriers (Zuliani et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; Sportelli et al., 2020, pp. 2–3).

In conclusion, metformin exhibits substantial promise as a therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on its well-characterized safety profile, long history of clinical use, and multifaceted action on mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis. Its ability to induce a mild inhibition of mitochondrial complex I and thereby activate AMPK—with subsequent upregulation of PGC-1α and promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis—directly targets key pathomechanisms underlying FRDA. These include the oxidative stress and bioenergetic failure that arise from frataxin deficiency. While the clinical evidence for metformin in Friedreich’s Ataxia is currently indirect—largely inferred from its efficacy in other neurodegenerative and mitochondrial conditions—there is robust biochemical and preclinical support for its further investigation in this setting (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 3–5; Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Li et al., 2022, pp. 7–8).

The main challenges reside in determining the optimal dose that is capable of eliciting beneficial AMPK-mediated compensatory mechanisms without exacerbating the energy deficiency already present in frataxin-deficient neurons. Moreover, cell type–specific differences in AMPK signaling and mitochondrial dynamics necessitate comprehensive studies using FRDA models. In light of these considerations, systematic preclinical evaluation using FRDA-specific cellular and animal models is imperative. Such studies should focus on the dose-response relationship of metformin in neuronal tissues, quantify improvements in oxygen consumption rates, monitor mitochondrial coupling efficiency, and measure reductions in ROS production. Only with these rigorous validations can metformin ultimately be considered a viable therapeutic option for FRDA.

Overall, metformin’s theoretical benefits—including improvements in mitochondrial biogenesis, enhanced antioxidant defenses, and the rebalancing of cellular bioenergetics—make it an appealing repurposing candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its extensive clinical background provides significant advantages in terms of known pharmacokinetics, safety, and potential for rapid regulatory approval compared with entirely novel drugs. However, the translation of metformin’s known effects in diabetes and other neurodegenerative models into a meaningful treatment for FRDA will depend on careful dose optimization and comprehensive preclinical studies to ensure that its mitochondrial inhibitory effects do not inadvertently worsen the energy deficit in vulnerable neuronal cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 16–17). If these hurdles can be overcome, metformin could offer a new avenue for mitigating the neurodegenerative progression observed in Friedreich’s Ataxia, representing an exciting opportunity for repurposing a well-known drug to address a critical unmet need in mitochondrial disease therapy.

In summary, the major strengths of metformin include its well-documented safety profile over decades of clinical use, its low cost and wide availability, and its multifaceted mechanism of action that directly addresses key pathological features of FRDA—namely mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired energy metabolism, and ROS overproduction. The weaknesses lie primarily in the currently unproven efficacy of metformin in FRDA-specific models and the challenges inherent in fine-tuning a therapeutic window that balances energy stress and compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis in already compromised neurons. Given these considerations, metformin warrants continued investigation in rigorous preclinical studies dedicated to the Friedreich’s Ataxia model before moving into clinical trials. Such work is justified by the mechanistic plausibility and extensive safety experience with the drug, making it a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia (Amengual-Cladera et al., 2024, pp. 22–24; Demaré et al., 2021, pp. 16–17; Li et al., 2022, pp. 7–8).

A-196 (SUV4-20 H1 Inhibitor),"Proposal for A-196 (SUV4-20 H1 Inhibitor)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
A-196 is a first‐in‐class small molecule inhibitor that targets the SUV4-20 histone methyltransferases, specifically SUV4-20H1 and SUV4-20H2, which are responsible for depositing the di- and tri-methylation marks on histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me2 and H4K20me3). The compound was discovered through high-throughput screening efforts, notably using an in vitro scintillation proximity assay to measure methyltransferase activity on a histone H4 peptide substrate. Structurally, A-196 contains a phthalazine core that engages in critical π-stacking interactions and forms hydrogen bonds within the enzyme’s active site, thereby blocking access to the substrate binding groove while leaving the cofactor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding site unaffected. This substrate-competitive, cofactor-noncompetitive mechanism of inhibition distinguishes A-196 within the broader class of epigenetic chemical probes. Compounds in this class have traditionally been used to dissect the role of epigenetic modifications in gene regulation, chromatin remodeling, and DNA damage response, and they have been utilized extensively as research tools in oncology, developmental biology, and now increasingly in neurological diseases. A-196 in particular emerges from efforts led by consortia such as the Structural Genomics Consortium, which aims to develop high-quality chemical probes for epigenetic enzymes. Its discovery and structural optimization are supported by crystallographic analyses and extensive structure-activity relationship studies, which have even facilitated the synthesis of analogues with enhanced potency and improved drug-like properties (Bromberg et al., 2017; Quinlan, 2021; Vilema-Enriquez et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
To date, A-196 has primarily been employed as a chemical probe tool compound in preclinical studies focused on the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, especially concerning histone H4K20 methylation. Its activity has been validated in a wide array of cellular assays investigating genomic stability, DNA repair, and chromatin organization. In the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA), A-196 was repurposed based on the hypothesis that SUV4-20-mediated repressive H4K20 methylation contributes to the transcriptional silencing of the FXN gene. The initial studies using FRDA patient-derived fibroblasts, lymphoblastoid cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated a modest upregulation (approximately 1.5- to 2-fold) in frataxin expression after treatment with A-196, and parallel genetic knockdown experiments confirmed a pivotal role for SUV4-20H1 in mediating FXN repression. However, beyond these preclinical cell-based studies, there is no documented clinical or veterinary history for A-196 as a therapeutic agent, nor has it been used in trials addressing FRDA or other mitochondrial epigenetic diseases. Its use remains confined to experimental models, with ongoing research exploring structural analogues to overcome metabolic liabilities and improve in vivo drug-like properties (Vilema-Enriquez et al., 2020; Vilema-Enriquez, 2018; Quinlan, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, A-196 exerts its effect by selectively inhibiting the enzymatic activity of SUV4-20H1, an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of methyl groups to lysine 20 on histone H4, yielding the di- (H4K20me2) and tri-methylated (H4K20me3) forms. These repressive marks are intimately linked to the formation of heterochromatin and transcriptional silencing, including the repression of the FXN gene in the context of FRDA. The binding of A-196 to the SUV4-20 active site is mediated by its phthalazine core, which allows π-stacking interactions with aromatic residues such as Trp264 and Phe281, and forms crucial hydrogen bonds that inhibit the catalytic function of the enzyme (Bromberg et al., 2017). As a result, treatment with A-196 leads to a decrease in the global levels of H4K20me2 and H4K20me3, while concomitantly raising the levels of the monomethylated form, H4K20me1. This shift in histone methylation landscape is significant because H4K20me1 is associated with a more relaxed chromatin state and active transcription. In FRDA, the silencing of FXN is epigenetically driven by aberrant heterochromatin formation, and reducing the repressive H4K20 methylation marks at the FXN promoter is hypothesized to de-repress the gene, thereby increasing the production of frataxin protein. This mechanism is supported by both pharmacological inhibition using A-196 and siRNA-mediated knockdown studies that implicated SUV4-20H1 as a key regulator of FXN expression, with downstream transcriptional effects observed to be relatively selective and limited compared to broader-acting epigenetic drugs such as HDAC inhibitors (Bromberg et al., 2017; Vilema-Enriquez et al., 2020; Quinlan, 2021).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, treatment of FRDA fibroblasts and other relevant cell types with A-196 is expected to lead to a reduction in the repressive histone marks H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 at the FXN promoter region, thereby decreasing the heterochromatic silencing of the FXN gene. This epigenetic modulation is anticipated to result in an increase in the monomethylated form H4K20me1, which is more conducive to an open chromatin configuration and active gene transcription. Consequently, the de-repression of the FXN gene should upregulate frataxin protein levels. Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein critical for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters; therefore, elevated frataxin levels are expected to restore or normalize mitochondrial function, as evidenced by improvements in cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ATP production, and possibly reduced mitochondrial oxidative stress. In vitro assays have indicated that modest increases in FXN expression, even in the range of 1.5- to 2-fold, may have beneficial effects, given that heterozygous carriers with approximately 50% of normal frataxin levels do not develop the disease. This implies that even partial restoration of FXN could translate into significant cellular benefits. Moreover, preliminary combination studies—where A-196 has been administered with other epigenetic modulators such as inhibitors of EZH2—suggest synergistic effects that further enhance FXN expression, potentially mitigating the risk of off-target effects by allowing lower doses of each individual compound (Vilema-Enriquez, 2018; Quinlan, 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
The body of in vitro and cellular evidence supports the rationale that selective inhibition of SUV4-20H1 by A-196 constitutes a promising therapeutic strategy for Friedreich’s Ataxia. One of the foremost strengths of A-196 is its high degree of potency and selectivity for its epigenetic target, which leads to a measurable de-repression of the FXN gene with modest genome-wide transcriptional perturbations. The detailed crystallographic and biochemical analyses that define its binding interactions provide confidence in its mechanism of action, while the observed shifts in histone methylation profiles (reduction in H4K20me2/3 and increase in H4K20me1) directly correlate with the expected epigenetic reactivation of FXN. Furthermore, the fact that SUV4-20 inhibition can increase FXN expression without inducing broad cytotoxicity or widespread gene expression changes stands in contrast to more global epigenetic agents such as HDAC inhibitors, which suffer from off-target effects and systemic toxicities. This targeted mode of action is crucial for a disease like FRDA, where selective restoration of frataxin levels has the potential to improve mitochondrial function and ameliorate disease phenotypes.

Nevertheless, several weaknesses and outstanding questions remain. The degree of FXN upregulation achieved with A-196 in current studies is relatively modest. While a 1.5- or 2-fold increase in frataxin may be biologically significant, it remains uncertain whether this level of restoration would be sufficient for clinical benefit in FRDA patients. Moreover, the long-term consequences of globally altering histone methylation states, even in a selective manner, are not fully understood. SUV4-20 methyltransferases have important roles in normal cellular processes such as DNA damage response and genomic integrity, and chronic inhibition may have unintended deleterious effects, including genomic instability or compromised DNA repair, especially in long-lived tissues like neurons and cardiomyocytes. In addition, early preclinical studies have revealed metabolic liabilities with A-196, including high clearance rates and short half-lives in hepatocyte models, indicating that further medicinal chemistry optimization is necessary before the compound can be advanced to in vivo animal models or clinical trials. Fortunately, SAR efforts have already identified analogues with improved metabolic stability and potency, which could potentially overcome these pharmacokinetic hurdles during lead optimization.

From a translational perspective, although no clinical or veterinary studies have yet been performed using A-196 or any SUV4-20 inhibitors in FRDA models, its demonstrated efficacy in cellular models provides a strong rationale for further preclinical development. The strategic advantage of repurposing A-196 lies in its well-characterized mechanism, chemical tractability, and the availability of structural analogues that offer avenues for optimizing drug-like properties. Additionally, combination strategies with other epigenetic modulators may offer synergistic improvement in FXN expression while allowing lower doses to be used, which could mitigate potential side effects associated with broad-spectrum epigenetic reprogramming. Given the dearth of disease-modifying treatments for FRDA—where current therapies largely focus on symptom management and mitochondrial support—the potential of epigenetic reactivation of FXN represents a novel and promising avenue for therapeutic intervention.

In summary, A-196 is a highly selective, well-characterized chemical probe that targets SUV4-20H1 methyltransferase activity and has been shown to modulate histone H4K20 methylation in a manner that de-represses the FXN gene. Preclinical studies in FRDA cellular models have demonstrated that A-196 can modestly increase frataxin expression, thereby providing a proof-of-concept that epigenetic modulation may have therapeutic benefits in this disease. The strengths of this compound include its specificity, mechanistic clarity, and the possibility of further optimization through medicinal chemistry. However, challenges remain in terms of the modest magnitude of FXN upregulation, potential long-term effects on genomic stability, and suboptimal pharmacokinetics that necessitate further lead optimization before transitioning to animal models or clinical trials. Consequently, while A-196 emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in FRDA therapeutic development, additional work to refine its potency, metabolic stability, and in vivo efficacy is essential to determine whether it can be successfully advanced through the drug development pipeline (Vilema-Enriquez et al., 2020; Vilema-Enriquez, 2018; Quinlan, 2021; Papadaki & Piperi, 2024).

Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN),"Proposal for Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is a naturally occurring nucleotide that is synthesized endogenously as an intermediate in the salvage pathway of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺) biosynthesis. NMN is formed primarily through the enzymatic action of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) on nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B₃, and is subsequently converted to NAD⁺ by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) enzymes. As such, NMN belongs to the class of NAD⁺ precursors, a group of molecules that have garnered considerable attention for their ability to boost intracellular NAD⁺ levels. This class also includes compounds like nicotinamide riboside (NR) and niacin (nicotinic acid). Historically, NAD⁺ precursors have been investigated both as dietary supplements and as pharmacological agents aimed at counteracting the decline in NAD⁺ levels observed during aging and in various metabolic diseases. Their use in preclinical models has been associated with improvements in metabolic function, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, and even protection from neurodegenerative changes. NMN, in particular, has been studied for its rapid uptake and conversion to NAD⁺, making it especially promising as a metabolic enhancer with potential applications in disorders characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) (Cantó et al., 2012; Massudi et al., 2012).

Therapeutic History:
The use of NAD⁺ intermediates has a rich preclinical history. NMN has been administered in animal models of mitochondrial disease, where its supplementation was shown to restore NAD⁺ pools, improve oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In various rodent studies, NMN administration improved mitochondrial function, enhanced ATP production, and provided significant protection against the metabolic derangements associated with aging and ischemic injury (Sims et al., 2018; Mendelsohn & Larrick, 2014). Additionally, NMN has been evaluated in several early-phase clinical studies which have consistently demonstrated its safety and its ability to increase blood NAD⁺ levels in healthy human subjects. For instance, clinical trials such as NCT04817111 and NCT05984550 have investigated the use of NAD⁺ precursors to modulate mitochondrial bioenergetics and immune cell function, providing important translational evidence that supports the mechanism of action seen in preclinical models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; McCormack, 2021; Shanghai Cell Therapy Group Co., Ltd., 2023). Although NMN has not been directly trialed in FRDA patients in published studies, related compounds such as niacin and nicotinamide have been applied in Friedreich’s Ataxia contexts. Specifically, nicotinamide was evaluated in open-label studies of FRDA, where it was shown to increase frataxin mRNA and protein levels, albeit without marked neurological improvement over short durations (Rufini et al., 2022). This historical background suggests that while NMN itself has a well-established safety and efficacy profile in terms of NAD⁺ boosting, its application to FRDA remains to be explored, making the current hypothesis highly compelling due to the mechanistic rationale drawn from both metabolic and mitochondrial models (Radenkovic et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
NMN acts as an immediate precursor in the NAD⁺ salvage pathway, thereby replenishing intracellular NAD⁺ pools that are essential for many cellular processes, including energy metabolism, DNA repair, and the regulation of gene expression. Once NMN is taken up by cells—potentially via transport mechanisms such as the recently identified Slc12a8 transporter—it is converted to NAD⁺ by NMNAT isoforms. Elevated levels of NAD⁺ then serve two critical roles. First, NAD⁺ functions as an essential redox coenzyme in metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), thereby driving ATP synthesis. Second, NAD⁺ acts as a necessary cofactor for a family of NAD⁺-dependent deacetylases known as sirtuins. Among these, SIRT3 is of particular interest because it is localized to the mitochondria and is known to directly regulate the acetylation status of mitochondrial proteins. Activation of SIRT3 leads to deacetylation of key mitochondrial enzymes, thereby enhancing their activity and improving overall mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics (Okabe et al., 2022; Mendelsohn & Larrick, 2014). In a cellular context relevant to Friedreich’s Ataxia—a disease marked by mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress—enhancing NAD⁺ levels via NMN supplementation would theoretically stimulate SIRT3 activity. This, in turn, would promote the deacetylation of multiple mitochondrial proteins involved in OXPHOS, leading to improved electron transport chain function, enhanced ATP production, and reduced generation of harmful ROS. The mechanistic detail extends to the observation that increased NAD⁺ levels help correct the redox imbalance (the NAD⁺/NADH ratio) seen during cellular stress, which is critical for maintaining ATP production efficiency (Sims et al., 2018; Srivastava, 2016).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis of the current proposal is that NMN administration in FRDA patient-derived fibroblasts will rapidly increase intracellular NAD⁺ levels, thereby boosting SIRT3 activity. In practice, this is expected to lead to enhanced deacetylation of mitochondrial OXPHOS enzymes, which are often hyperacetylated in conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction. The functional outcome of this deacetylation process would be an improvement in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, as measured by increases in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and enhanced ATP synthesis. In vitro assays using FRDA fibroblasts are anticipated to demonstrate these improvements with a concomitant reduction in oxidative stress markers, such as decreased ROS production. There is substantial evidence from animal models showing that NMN can indeed restore NAD⁺ levels, preserve mitochondrial respiration, and reduce oxidative stress in various tissues (Sims et al., 2018; Mendelsohn & Larrick, 2014). Additionally, given that SIRT3 is highly expressed in mitochondrial-rich tissues and is known to be critical for maintaining mitochondrial protein homeostasis, its activation in FRDA fibroblasts would further support the rationale that NMN will lead to a marked improvement in mitochondrial function (Okabe et al., 2022; Radenkovic et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, NMN appears to be a highly promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on several lines of evidence drawn from biochemical, clinical, and preclinical research. The strengths of NMN as a candidate lie in its well-defined role as an NAD⁺ precursor, its ability to rapidly increase intracellular NAD⁺ levels, and its demonstrated capacity to enhance mitochondrial function by activating SIRT3 and other NAD⁺-dependent enzymes. Preclinical evidence from animal models has consistently shown that NMN administration improves oxygen consumption, reduces oxidative stress, and enhances ATP production, all of which are particularly relevant in the context of FRDA, a disorder characterized by significant mitochondrial dysfunction (Sims et al., 2018; Mendelsohn & Larrick, 2014). In terms of safety, early-phase clinical trials with NMN in healthy subjects have reported good tolerability and effective NAD⁺ boosting, which provides a strong translational foundation for its further evaluation in patient populations (Okabe et al., 2022; Fukamizu et al., 2022).

However, there are also some challenges and weaknesses to consider. While there is ample evidence supporting the NAD⁺ boosting and mitochondrial enhancing properties of NMN in healthy individuals and in various disease models, there is currently a lack of direct clinical evidence for its efficacy in Friedreich’s Ataxia. The unique pathophysiology of FRDA, which includes frataxin deficiency, aberrant iron metabolism, and pronounced oxidative stress, may pose additional hurdles that are not fully addressed by NAD⁺ elevation alone. Furthermore, although NAD⁺ precursors such as nicotinamide have been evaluated in FRDA with some promising molecular endpoints, the translation of these findings into functional neurological improvements remains uncertain, as highlighted by short-duration studies that failed to show significant neurological benefits (Rufini et al., 2022). Another consideration is the tissue-specific uptake and metabolism of NMN. For example, while NMN is effective at increasing NAD⁺ in blood and liver, it may have variable efficacy in skeletal muscle and neural tissues, which are critical targets in FRDA. The potential inability of NMN to robustly penetrate certain tissues or cell types, and the possibility of differing enzyme expression profiles (e.g., NAMPT and NMNAT isoforms) in FRDA patient-derived fibroblasts compared to healthy cells, represent areas that require further investigation (Mendelsohn & Larrick, 2014; Radenkovic et al., 2020).

Despite these challenges, the overall mechanistic rationale—based on the restoration of NAD⁺ levels, activation of SIRT3, and subsequent improvements in mitochondrial bioenergetics—remains compelling. Given that FRDA is fundamentally a disease of mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress, targeting the NAD⁺ metabolism pathway with NMN offers a novel therapeutic approach that could complement existing interventions. Future studies will need to focus on optimizing dosing regimens, assessing tissue-specific uptake, and evaluating long-term effects on both biochemical and clinical endpoints in FRDA patients. Comparative studies with other NAD⁺ precursors, such as nicotinamide riboside, could also help elucidate whether NMN has unique advantages in terms of efficacy or safety in the FRDA context (Radenkovic et al., 2020; Srivastava, 2016).

In summary, NMN represents a well-rationalized and promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its natural origin as a key NAD⁺ intermediate, extensive preclinical evidence of enhancing mitochondrial function through SIRT3 activation, and confirmed safety in early-phase human trials provide strong support for its further evaluation in FRDA. The primary strengths of NMN lie in its ability to rapidly replenish intracellular NAD⁺, thereby improving oxidative phosphorylation and reducing oxidative damage. However, its potential limitations include the need for more robust and disease-specific clinical data and possible challenges related to tissue-specific pharmacodynamics in FRDA patients. Taken together, the available evidence encourages further investigation of NMN as a therapeutic strategy for mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction in Friedreich’s Ataxia, with the expectation that NMN-induced NAD⁺ elevation will lead to improved SIRT3 activity, enzyme deacetylation, and ultimately enhanced ATP synthesis in affected fibroblasts and other relevant cell types (Okabe et al., 2022; Sims et al., 2018; Rufini et al., 2022).

Urolithin A,"Proposal for Urolithin A

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Urolithin A is a naturally occurring gut microbiota‐derived metabolite produced via the conversion of ellagitannins and ellagic acid found in foods such as pomegranates, berries, and nuts. The generation of Urolithin A is mediated by specific bacterial species present in the human gut (Djedjibegovic et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022). Belonging to the class of polyphenol-derived postbiotics, Urolithin A has attracted considerable attention owing to its capacity to modulate mitochondrial function and quality through the activation of mitophagy. The discovery of Urolithin A has been closely linked to studies of dietary polyphenols and the role of the gut microbiome in generating bioactive metabolites; these investigations revealed that only a subset of individuals are capable of converting dietary ellagitannins into Urolithin A, while exogenous supplementation could overcome this limitation (Kothe et al., 2023). As a naturally derived compound, Urolithin A exemplifies a nutraceutical agent with a dual role; it is both a marker of a healthy gut microbial ecosystem and an active inducer of mitochondrial turnover. The compound is not synthesized chemically on a large scale in most cases; rather, it is isolated or produced through fermentation approaches that mimic microbial conversion processes. Historically, this class of compounds has been employed to target age-related declines in mitochondrial function, with various studies demonstrating beneficial effects in restoring mitochondrial respiration and increasing oxidative phosphorylation metrics in aged animal models. This background places Urolithin A as a promising candidate for repurposing to address mitochondrial dysfunction inherent to neurodegenerative disorders such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (Faitg et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Biochemically, Urolithin A has been evaluated in preclinical studies and early phase clinical trials principally in the context of age-associated muscle decline and metabolic dysfunction. Clinical trials, such as those examining its effects on mitochondrial bioenergetics in older adults (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019), have demonstrated that Urolithin A is well-tolerated in humans with a favorable safety profile. These studies have provided robust pharmacokinetic data that indicate dose-dependent increases in plasma concentrations, a moderately long half-life, and significant bioavailability when administered orally (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019). Although its application in Friedreich's Ataxia has not been directly tested—there are no registered clinical trials using Urolithin A for FRDA specifically (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—the compound’s history in addressing mitochondrial decline in muscle tissue offers a strong rationale for its repurposing. In various animal and cell-based models of mitochondrial dysfunction, Urolithin A has been shown to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, improve oxygen consumption rates (OCR), and stimulate key pathways involved in mitochondrial turnover by enhancing mitophagy (Li et al., 2022; Pradeepkiran et al., 2022). Its therapeutic history thus far has been primarily in contexts related to aging, metabolic disorders, and neuroprotective applications in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease models, where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key pathological role. Therefore, while Urolithin A has not been used directly in FRDA, its repurposing for diseases marked by mitochondrial impairments, such as Friedreich’s Ataxia, is supported by a strong foundation of preclinical and early clinical data demonstrating its ability to modulate mitochondrial health (Sorrentino et al., 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
The central mechanism of action of Urolithin A lies in its capacity to induce mitophagy – the selective autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria. At the molecular level, it acts by upregulating key proteins involved in the PINK1/Parkin pathway, a critical regulatory cascade for mitochondrial quality control. Under conditions of mitochondrial depolarization, the serine/threonine kinase PINK1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane. PINK1 then phosphorylates ubiquitin and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, leading to the recruitment of autophagy receptors that tag damaged mitochondria for degradation via the autophagosome–lysosome pathway (Pradeepkiran et al., 2022; Stepanova & Magrané, 2020). In cellular studies, Urolithin A has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the accumulation of phosphorylated Parkin and other mitophagy markers, thereby promoting the proper recycling of dysfunctional mitochondria and the biogenesis of healthy organelles. This molecular cascade results in increased maximal OCR and coupling efficiency, which reflects overall improvements in mitochondrial respiratory capacity and energy production. In addition to activating the PINK1/Parkin axis, Urolithin A has been shown to modulate other signaling pathways such as AMPK signaling and to upregulate mitochondrial biogenesis factors, including PGC-1α, ultimately fostering an environment conducive to mitochondrial renewal and enhanced cellular bioenergetics (Djedjibegovic et al., 2020; Kothe et al., 2023). Moreover, studies in models of age-related muscle decline have shown that Urolithin A decreases oxidative stress and reduces mitochondrial damage by functioning as a potent antioxidant that indirectly supports mitochondrial health (Faitg et al., 2024). Given that FRDA pathophysiology is characterized by frataxin deficiency leading to defective iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis, excess ROS generation, and impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, the mitophagy-enhancing and mitochondrial-renewing properties of Urolithin A are particularly applicable. It is expected that by promoting the PINK1/Parkin-mediated removal of damaged mitochondria, Urolithin A can reset mitochondrial quality control and restore bioenergetic capacity in FRDA neurons (Hayashi & Cortopassi, 2015).

Expected Effect:
Based on the preclinical evidence accumulated from studies in aging muscle and neurodegenerative models, the hypothesis for employing Urolithin A in Friedreich’s Ataxia is that it will induce mitophagy via the PINK1/Parkin pathway in affected FRDA neurons. In this context, the compound is expected to facilitate the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria that accumulate as a consequence of frataxin deficiency, thereby triggering compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis. The net effect would be a restoration of mitochondrial coupling efficiency and maximal OCR – key measures of mitochondrial respiratory function – which are typically compromised in FRDA due to impaired iron-sulfur cluster formation (Pradeepkiran et al., 2022; Stepanova & Magrané, 2020). The improved mitochondrial turnover would also lead to a reduction in ROS levels as damaged, ROS-producing mitochondrial components are removed from the cellular environment, thus alleviating oxidative stress. Importantly, FRDA neurons, like other postmitotic cells, are highly reliant on robust mitochondrial function for energy generation and survival. Given that studies have documented the expression of key mitophagy regulators such as PINK1 and Parkin in neurons, and that mitochondrial dysfunction is a core component of FRDA pathology (Hayashi & Cortopassi, 2015), it is reasonable to expect that Urolithin A will exert a neuroprotective effect in FRDA by restoring mitochondrial homeostasis. In vitro assays using FRDA-derived neuronal cell lines or patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are likely to reveal improvements in bioenergetic parameters, such as increased OCR and ATP production, lower oxidative damage, and elevated expression levels of mitochondrial biogenesis markers after Urolithin A treatment (Pradeepkiran et al., 2022; Kothe et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of Urolithin A as a therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia is promising but remains at a preclinical and translational stage. Its major strengths include a well-documented mechanism of action that addresses one of the central pathological features of FRDA—mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired mitophagy. Multiple preclinical studies have demonstrated that Urolithin A is capable of activating the PINK1/Parkin pathway, resulting in enhanced clearance of damaged mitochondria and stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis (Pradeepkiran et al., 2022; Sorrentino et al., 2018). Additionally, favorable safety profiles from nutritional clinical studies, along with robust pharmacokinetic data, support its potential for rapid translation to human use (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019). Another key advantage is the dual nature of Urolithin A: not only does it promote the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria, but it also induces the generation of new, functional organelles, which is critical in diseases marked by severe mitochondrial impairment such as FRDA.

However, there are notable weaknesses and gaps that must be addressed before Urolithin A can be validated specifically for FRDA treatment. There is an absence of direct clinical or preclinical evidence examining Urolithin A’s effects in FRDA models or patient-derived cells. The existing clinical trials have been limited to healthy adults and conditions primarily related to muscle aging or metabolic dysfunction, rather than neurodegenerative or mitochondrial diseases such as FRDA (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, while the mechanistic hypothesis centered on PINK1/Parkin activation is strongly supported by studies in other disease contexts, it remains to be confirmed whether FRDA neurons respond similarly to Urolithin A supplementation. This represents a critical gap in the literature, as FRDA’s mitochondrial pathology has unique features that may require tailored dosing or combination therapies. Additionally, although Urolithin A has been described as having antioxidant properties and the ability to reduce ROS, the extent to which these effects directly translate to improved neurologic outcomes in FRDA is not yet established. Future research should focus on rigorous in vitro studies using FRDA-relevant cell lines and in vivo animal models that recapitulate the frataxin deficiency seen in patients. Such studies should aim to measure not only bioenergetic parameters, but also improvements in neuronal survival, oxidative stress markers, and motor function to provide a comprehensive evaluation of therapeutic potential.

In summary, Urolithin A represents a highly promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia due to its dual action in promoting mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis via the PINK1/Parkin pathway, its capacity to reduce oxidative stress, and its favorable safety profile established in human studies. The convergence of biochemical, preclinical, and early clinical data supports the hypothesis that enhancing the turnover of damaged mitochondria in FRDA could restore cellular energy homeostasis and mitigate disease progression. The strengths of Urolithin A lie in its natural origin, acceptable pharmacokinetics, and robust mechanistic evidence in related mitochondrial dysfunction models (Djedjibegovic et al., 2020; Pradeepkiran et al., 2022). However, its weaknesses include the current lack of direct evidence in FRDA models and the need to confirm that neuronal mitochondrial quality control systems in FRDA can be reactivated by this compound to a therapeutically relevant extent (Hayashi & Cortopassi, 2015). Based on the available literature, further targeted preclinical studies and subsequent clinical trials in FRDA patients are warranted to validate the therapeutic potential of Urolithin A for this indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kothe et al., 2023).

Below is a detailed evaluation of Deferasirox (Exjade) as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia, structured as a scientific proposal review.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Deferasirox (marketed as Exjade) is an orally active, synthetic iron chelator that belongs to a class of tridentate bis‐hydroxyphenyl‐triazole compounds. It was developed through a rational drug design program to overcome the limitations of earlier iron chelation agents such as deferoxamine, which suffers from the inconvenience of parenteral administration and poor cell penetration. Deferasirox binds ferric iron with high affinity, forming a stable 2:1 complex with Fe(III). The structural design—synthesized in two steps starting from a salicylic acid derivative—yields a compound that is highly lipophilic enough to allow improved bioavailability yet selective for iron over other metals. Its oral bioavailability (approximately 70%), long plasma half‐life (typically 8 to 16 hours, with some reports even noting sustained levels conducive to once-daily dosing), and extensive protein binding (roughly 99% bound to serum albumin) have made it the agent of choice for managing transfusional iron overload in conditions such as β-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (Stumpf, 2007; Tanaka, 2014). Belonging to the synthetic iron chelator class, its development represents a shift from natural siderophores to rationally designed molecules with improved pharmacokinetic properties, and its chemical class has been used extensively in the management of systemic iron overload. Although initially developed for hematological conditions, its chemical profile suggests that, if it accesses intracellular or even mitochondrial iron pools, it could have broader applications.

Therapeutic History:
Deferasirox’s therapeutic history is extensive in the context of chronic iron overload. Clinically, it has been approved since 2005 by regulatory authorities worldwide to manage iron overload in transfusion-dependent patients, particularly in thalassemia major, sickle cell disease, and myelodysplastic syndromes (Stumpf, 2007; Tanaka, 2014). Over the years extensive phase II and III clinical trials have established its efficacy in lowering serum ferritin levels and reducing liver iron concentration, while its oral formulation greatly improves compliance compared to the parenteral administration required with deferoxamine (Piga & Cappellini, 2006; Palumbo et al., 2021). In addition, its pharmacokinetic profile and favorable safety data have been demonstrated in both pediatric and adult populations (Stumpf, 2007; Entezari et al., 2022). Notably, while clinical usage in systemic iron overload has been robust with decades of patient experience, there are no formally registered clinical trials evaluating deferasirox specifically in Friedreich’s Ataxia or other mitochondrial iron overload disorders as confirmed by recent searches (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, the biochemical rationale of iron chelation in diseases with mitochondrial iron dysregulation, as seen in Friedreich’s Ataxia, has been extensively discussed in the literature (Chaston & Richardson, 2003; Núñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018). Thus, although it has not yet been applied directly in FRDA patient populations, the demonstrated clinical utility of deferasirox in other iron overload conditions supports its potential repurposing.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, deferasirox functions by selectively chelating ferric iron (Fe3+) in both extracellular and intracellular compartments. Its tridentate ligand structure allows it to form a 2:1 complex with iron, thereby sequestering free iron and reducing the labile iron pool (LIP) responsible for catalyzing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via Fenton chemistry. The drug’s high affinity for Fe3+ reduces the availability of iron that may otherwise participate in redox cycling reactions which produce hydroxyl radicals and other cytotoxic species (Tanaka, 2014; Stumpf, 2007). Furthermore, while much of its clinical benefit in iron overload stems from its ability to facilitate excretion through the biliary system, there is preclinical evidence suggesting that its ability to bind intracellular iron may extend to iron in mitochondrial compartments (Unknown Reference; Vaubel & Isaya, 2013). In iron overload conditions, excess iron accumulates in tissues such as the liver and heart; in the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, mitochondrial iron accumulation is a hallmark owing to frataxin deficiency. The reduced frataxin levels in FRDA cells impair proper iron–sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly, leading to a buildup of mitochondrial iron and subsequent oxidative stress (Llorens et al., 2019; Santos et al., 2010). While deferasirox was primarily developed to remove iron from systemic pools, its physicochemical properties—including its moderate lipophilicity and oral bioavailability—suggest that it might also access intracellular iron reserves, including those in the mitochondria (Stumpf, 2007; Tanaka, 2014). This is supported by mechanistic studies showing that iron chelators sharing similar enzymatic targeting have been shown to mitigate mitochondrial oxidative stress by expanding the mitochondrial iron chelatable pool (Chaston & Richardson, 2003; Rodríguez et al., 2020). However, compared to smaller chelators such as deferiprone, which have demonstrated superior mitochondrial penetration (Lee et al., 2016), there is some uncertainty whether deferasirox can achieve sufficiently high mitochondrial concentrations. Nonetheless, its strong binding affinity and sustained plasma levels may yield a net reduction in the labile iron pool even if only a fraction of the drug accesses the mitochondria (Núñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018; Ward et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis driving the repurposing strategy for Friedreich's Ataxia posits that deferasirox will bind mitochondrial iron with high affinity in FRDA cells, thereby lowering the labile iron pool, decreasing ROS generation, and normalizing complex I-driven oxygen consumption. In FRDA, frataxin deficiency is known to lead to mitochondrial iron accumulation, contributing to excessive ROS generation through Fenton reactions, and impairing the activity of mitochondrial iron–sulfur proteins such as complex I and aconitase (Llorens et al., 2019; Santos et al., 2010). By chelating excess mitochondrial iron, deferasirox is expected to reduce oxidative stress, which is a key driver of mitochondrial dysfunction in FRDA. Moreover, by “normalizing” the labile iron pool, deferasirox could help restore proper mitochondrial function, including the reactivation of complex I-driven oxygen consumption—a parameter that is often depressed in FRDA due to iron-induced oxidative damage (Rodríguez et al., 2020; Marmolino, 2011). This proposed effect is based on the concept that reducing redox-active iron will lead to lower generation of hydroxyl radicals, thereby attenuating the cascade of mitochondrial damage that results from oxidative stress. At the cellular level, the expected cascade involves decreased iron-mediated ROS production, improved functionality of iron–sulfur cluster enzymes, and ultimately enhanced ATP production and reduced apoptotic signaling. This mechanism is supported by preclinical studies in which iron chelation has improved cellular bioenergetics and reduced oxidative markers in models of mitochondrial iron overload (Chaston & Richardson, 2003; Vaubel & Isaya, 2013). Additionally, indirect evidence from studies involving other chelators such as deferiprone in FRDA models has shown that lowering mitochondrial iron can delay or reverse some aspects of the pathological phenotype (Lee et al., 2016; Núñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018). Thus, it is anticipated that in an assay using FRDA-derived cells, deferasirox treatment would yield measurable improvements in mitochondrial respiration rates and reductions in oxidative stress biomarkers.

Overall Evaluation:
The comprehensive review of the literature supports the notion that deferasirox has several strengths as a repurposed candidate for Friedreich's Ataxia, yet there remain significant uncertainties that must be addressed in further studies.

Strengths include:
•  Established Clinical Safety and Pharmacokinetics: Deferasirox has a well-documented safety profile and robust PK/ADME data from its long-term use in patients with transfusional iron overload. The oral bioavailability, long half-life, once-daily dosing regimen, and predictable pharmacokinetics observed in thalassemic patients provide a strong foundation from which to repurpose the drug (Stumpf, 2007; Tanaka, 2014; Palumbo et al., 2021).
•  Mechanistic Rationale: The central role of mitochondrial iron accumulation and oxidative stress in FRDA pathogenesis makes iron chelation an attractive therapeutic strategy. Deferasirox’s ability to chelate ferric iron with high affinity could theoretically reduce the labile iron pool responsible for ROS generation and thereby improve mitochondrial function (Llorens et al., 2019; Santos et al., 2010).
•  Oral Administration and Patient Compliance: As an oral agent, deferasirox circumvents the compliance issues associated with parenteral chelators such as deferoxamine. This is especially relevant in a chronic neurodegenerative condition like FRDA, where long-term treatment adherence is critical (Stumpf, 2007; Palumbo et al., 2021).

Weaknesses and Concerns include:
•  Mitochondrial Penetration Uncertainty: Although the compound is effective at reducing systemic iron overload, there is limited direct evidence that deferasirox accumulates in mitochondria to an extent sufficient for therapeutic efficacy in FRDA. In preclinical studies, other chelators like deferiprone have shown greater mitochondrial access, which casts some doubt on whether deferasirox can adequately lower mitochondrial labile iron (Lee et al., 2016; Núñez & Chana-Cuevas, 2018; Ward et al., 2021).
•  Lack of Direct Clinical Evidence in FRDA: To date, no clinical trials have formally evaluated the efficacy of deferasirox in Friedreich’s Ataxia patients. While theoretical and mechanistic support exists, the absence of direct clinical data regarding its impact on mitochondrial iron, ROS levels, or clinical outcomes in FRDA remains a significant gap (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chaston & Richardson, 2003).
•  Potential Impact on Iron-Dependent Processes: FRDA is a condition in which not only is iron accumulation problematic, but proper iron utilization is already compromised due to frataxin deficiency. There is a theoretical risk that iron chelation might inadvertently deplete iron needed for essential cellular functions if not dosed carefully, although the demonstrated safety in iron overload patients is reassuring (Tanaka, 2014; Vaubel & Isaya, 2013).

In summary, the overall evaluation is cautiously optimistic. Deferasirox emerges as a promising candidate based on its robust clinical history in iron overload disorders, well-characterized pharmacokinetics, and established safety profile. Mechanistically, its ability to bind ferric iron and reduce the labile iron pool is directly relevant to addressing mitochondrial iron-mediated oxidative stress—one of the core pathophysiological features in Friedreich's Ataxia (Llorens et al., 2019; Santos et al., 2010). Its oral route of administration further enhances its appeal for long-term, chronic diseases. However, significant gaps exist regarding its capacity to penetrate mitochondria and effectively chelate the mitochondrial iron that is central to FRDA pathology. Consequently, while the theoretical rationale is strong and preclinical models support iron chelation strategies, extensive additional research—both in vitro using FRDA-derived cell models and in vivo in relevant animal models—is needed to confirm mitochondrial bioavailability, optimize dosing, and determine potential effects on mitochondrial respiratory function and antioxidant defenses (Rodríguez et al., 2020; Marmolino, 2011).

Overall, we conclude that deferasirox possesses potential for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its strengths in pharmacokinetics, safety, and mechanism of reducing labile iron and oxidative stress are compelling. However, the weaknesses underscore the need for targeted preclinical studies to verify mitochondrial targeting and to evaluate the balance between efficacious iron chelation and preservation of essential iron-dependent mitochondrial processes. Thus, while deferasirox should be considered a promising candidate and prioritized for further mechanistic and preclinical evaluation, caution and rigorous experimental validation are warranted before initiating clinical trials in FRDA patients (Chaston & Richardson, 2003; Tanaka, 2014; Ward et al., 2021).

A-769662,"Proposal for A-769662

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
A-769662 is a synthetic small‐molecule compound belonging to the thienopyridone family that was originally identified for its capacity to directly activate AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK), a central regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. Unlike traditional AMPK activators such as AICAR or metformin, which rely on indirect mechanisms such as the elevation of intracellular AMP levels or mitochondrial complex I inhibition, A-769662 binds directly to the carbohydrate‐binding module (CBM) on the β1 regulatory subunit of the AMPK heterotrimer. This binding occurs at what is known as the allosteric drug and metabolite-binding (ADaM) site, resulting in a conformational change that facilitates the kinase activity of the catalytic α subunit and simultaneously protects the key activating phosphorylation site, Thr172, from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases (Kim et al., 2011; Treebak et al., 2009). Because of its synthetic origin and the ease with which its chemical structure can be modified to optimize pharmacokinetics and target engagement, A-769662 represents a promising candidate for repurposing in diseases characterized by energy deficits and mitochondrial dysfunction, such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA). As a representative of a class of compounds engineered to engage cellular energy sensors with high specificity, A-769662 has been leveraged in a variety of preclinical models of metabolic dysfunction, where its effects on lipid metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, and antioxidant defense have been documented (Vincent et al., 2015).

Therapeutic History:
The body of evidence accumulated to date on A-769662 is predominantly preclinical, with the compound being extensively studied in biochemical, cellular, and animal systems rather than in clinical or veterinary settings. In isolated cell systems and animal models, A-769662 has been used to probe the regulatory mechanisms of AMPK activation in tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver, and heart. For instance, in cardiomyocyte studies, A-769662 has been shown to increase AMPK phosphorylation and to elicit downstream phosphorylation events that include the modification of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which is classically used as a readout of AMPK activation (Chen et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2011). Preclinical work in metabolic disease models has demonstrated that this compound improves mitochondrial respiratory capacity and spares reserve respiratory capacity—an indication that the compound can enhance cellular oxidative metabolism (Vincent et al., 2015). Despite the promising data from these studies, searches in established clinical trial databases using the terms “A-769662 OR AMPK activator AND Friedreich’s Ataxia” have yielded no results, suggesting that while A-769662 has been well studied in the context of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, ischemia–reperfusion injury, and other related conditions, it has not yet been investigated for either FRDA or similar mitochondrial pathologies in a clinical setting (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This historical record underscores both the promise and the translational gap for A-769662 as a candidate for FRDA, where mitochondrial dysfunction and energy deficits play a central role in disease pathogenesis (Vincent et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2011).

Mechanism of Action:
A-769662 exerts its biological activity through a well-defined molecular mechanism that centers on the direct activation of AMPK. AMPK is a heterotrimeric enzyme composed of an α catalytic subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits. While the γ subunit is responsible for sensing changes in the AMP:ATP ratio, A-769662 bypasses this regulatory mechanism by binding directly to the β1 subunit at its CBM, located at a site distinct from the nucleotide-binding region (Kim et al., 2011; Treebak et al., 2009). Binding of A-769662 induces an allosteric conformational change that not only enhances the intrinsic kinase activity of the α subunit but also stabilizes the phosphorylated state at Thr172, a modification essential for full AMPK activation. This stabilization is achieved by reducing the rate at which protein phosphatases dephosphorylate Thr172, thereby maintaining AMPK in an active state even under conditions where intracellular AMP levels may not be elevated (Kim et al., 2011; Treebak et al., 2009).

Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates a range of downstream substrates that orchestrate a cellular shift from energy-consuming anabolic processes to energy-producing catabolic pathways. One of the best-characterized targets is ACC. Phosphorylation of ACC results in its inhibition, which in turn lowers the levels of malonyl-CoA—a key inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation—and thereby promotes the oxidation of fatty acids to generate ATP (Vincent et al., 2015). In addition to this metabolic shift, AMPK activation has been shown to upregulate the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). PGC-1α is recognized as a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis; its activation leads to the induction of nuclear respiratory factors (NRF-1 and NRF-2) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which collectively drive mitochondrial DNA replication and the synthesis of new mitochondria (García-Giménez et al., 2011; Carvalho et al., 2024). In cellular models where mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is severely depleted, treatment with A-769662 has been observed to partially restore mtDNA levels and improve mitochondrial membrane potential, highlighting its potential role in ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction (Carvalho et al., 2024).

It is also noteworthy that while A-769662 is primarily characterized by its direct activation of AMPK, several studies have noted secondary actions that may be AMPK-independent. For example, in some astrocytic models, A-769662 has been reported to increase intracellular calcium levels and promote extracellular ATP release, which are effects that are not strictly dependent on AMPK activation (Walker et al., 2017; Moore et al., 2020). However, these additional actions do not detract from its core mechanism, which remains a targeted and specific activation of energy homeostasis pathways via AMPK, thereby setting the stage for improvements in mitochondrial biogenesis and energy production (Kim et al., 2011; Vincent et al., 2015).

Expected Effect:
Friedreich’s Ataxia is a multisystem neurodegenerative disease characterized by frataxin deficiency that leads to substantial mitochondrial dysfunction, manifesting in impaired oxidative phosphorylation, decreased ATP production, and heightened oxidative stress. It is well established that one of the compensatory cellular responses to mitochondrial dysfunction is the activation of mitochondrial biogenesis pathways, in which AMPK and PGC-1α play critical roles. The central hypothesis for repurposing A-769662 in FRDA is that its direct activation of AMPK in patient-derived cardiomyocytes and potentially other affected cell types will upregulate PGC-1α and thereby stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis. This improvement in mitochondrial mass and function is expected to restore coupling efficiency between substrate oxidation and ATP synthesis, ultimately leading to enhanced ATP production and a recovery of cellular energy homeostasis.

In vitro, when using FRDA patient-derived cardiomyocytes—which are of particular relevance given the high incidence of cardiomyopathy in FRDA—the addition of A-769662 is anticipated to result in a rapid and robust phosphorylation of AMPK, as evidenced by increased Thr172 phosphorylation in these cells (Kim et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2014). This activation, in turn, is expected to upregulate concentrations of PGC-1α, leading to an increased transcription of mitochondrial genes including TFAM, and thereby facilitating mtDNA replication and mitochondrial biogenesis (García-Giménez et al., 2011; Carvalho et al., 2024).

Furthermore, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, as driven by the increased expression of PGC-1α and associated transcription factors, should result in measurable improvements in cellular bioenergetics. These improvements would include an elevation in the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and an increase in the spare respiratory capacity (SRC) of the cardiomyocytes, thereby enhancing their ability to meet high energy demands during stress conditions (Vincent et al., 2015; Li et al., 2023). In addition, restoration of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and improvements in coupling efficiency between electron transport and ATP synthesis are anticipated. Such improvements would directly counteract the defects observed in FRDA, where impaired mitochondrial function leads to chronic energy deficits and increased oxidative stress—a cascade that further exacerbates neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathy associated with the disease (Carvalho et al., 2024).

It is also important to consider that cardiomyocytes express all the necessary components of the AMPK signaling pathway, including the catalytic α subunit along with the β1 and γ subunits, as well as downstream effectors such as PGC-1α, making them especially responsive to pharmacological modulation by compounds like A-769662 (Chen et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2021). Thus, the expected assay outcome in FRDA cardiomyocytes treated with A-769662 is an increase in AMPK phosphorylation, a subsequent upregulation of PGC-1α and mitochondrial biogenesis markers, and ultimately an improvement in overall ATP production and mitochondrial coupling efficiency—a constellation of effects that should ameliorate the energy crisis inherent in FRDA pathology (Li et al., 2023; García-Giménez et al., 2011).

Overall Evaluation:
A-769662 emerges as a compelling therapeutic candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia due to its direct and selective activation of AMPK, which underpins a cascade of metabolic effects that are highly relevant to the pathophysiology of FRDA. One of the principal strengths of A-769662 is its ability to bypass the need for elevated intracellular AMP levels—often a limiting factor in diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction—by directly engaging the AMPK complex through binding to the β1 subunit. This mechanism confers a predictable and robust activation of AMPK, leading to the downstream upregulation of PGC-1α and subsequent mitochondrial biogenesis, a process that is particularly desirable in FRDA where mitochondrial deficits are a key driver of disease progression (Kim et al., 2011; Treebak et al., 2009; García-Giménez et al., 2011).

In preclinical models, A-769662 has consistently demonstrated the capacity to enhance mitochondrial function by increasing oxygen consumption, spare respiratory capacity, and improving mitochondrial membrane potential—all essential parameters for restoring ATP production (Vincent et al., 2015; Carvalho et al., 2024). These biochemical and physiological effects are supported by a solid mechanistic understanding; by preventing the dephosphorylation of Thr172 on the α subunit of AMPK, A-769662 not only ensures sustained kinase activity but also guarantees that the cascade leading to mitochondrial biogenesis is engaged even in the face of an energy deficit. This is particularly important in FRDA, where energy homeostasis is disrupted due to frataxin deficiency and subsequent mitochondrial impairment (Carvalho et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2014).

However, despite its attractive mechanism and robust preclinical profile in models of metabolic dysfunction and ischemia–reperfusion injury, A-769662 has yet to be evaluated specifically in Friedreich’s Ataxia. Searches in clinical trial repositories indicate that there are no studies directly testing A-769662 or other AMPK activators in FRDA, which identifies a clear gap in the translational research needed to assess its therapeutic potential in this context (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This lack of direct clinical data represents a weakness that must be addressed through targeted preclinical studies using FRDA-specific cellular models and eventually animal models that recapitulate the mitochondrial deficits associated with FRDA.

Another challenge involves the demonstration of tissue-specific efficacy. While A-769662 has been shown to be effective in cardiomyocytes and liver cells, its distribution and bioavailability in other affected tissues—such as skeletal muscle and the nervous system, which are also impacted in FRDA—are less certain. Achieving therapeutic levels in all relevant tissues will be critical, particularly since FRDA is a multisystem disorder characterized by both cardiac and neurological manifestations (Treebak et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2011). Moreover, some studies have noted additional effects of A-769662, such as alterations in intracellular calcium signaling and extracellular ATP release that occur independently of AMPK activation (Walker et al., 2017; Moore et al., 2020). While these off-target actions do not necessarily undermine its potential use in FRDA, they do highlight the need for a careful dissection of on-target versus off-target effects in relevant disease models to optimize dosing and minimize potential side effects.

Furthermore, the multifaceted pathology of Friedreich’s Ataxia—which encompasses not only mitochondrial dysfunction and energy deficits but also oxidative stress, iron accumulation, and neurodegeneration—suggests that A-769662 may need to be used in combination with other therapeutic modalities. For instance, while activation of the AMPK-PGC-1α pathway could restore mitochondrial biogenesis and improve ATP production, additional agents that target oxidative stress or iron dysregulation might be necessary to fully address the comprehensive pathology of FRDA (García-Giménez et al., 2011). In this regard, A-769662 could serve as a valuable component of a combination therapy strategy, where its ability to enhance mitochondrial function is complemented by other agents that mitigate complementary aspects of the disease process.

In summary, A-769662 presents a cautiously optimistic opportunity for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its direct, AMP-independent mechanism of action allows for robust, selective activation of AMPK in cardiomyocytes and potentially other affected cell types, leading to upregulation of PGC-1α, promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis, and restoration of cellular energy homeostasis. These effects are strongly supported by preclinical data from models of metabolic disease and mitochondrial dysfunction (Kim et al., 2011; Vincent et al., 2015; Carvalho et al., 2024). However, the absence of any direct clinical or FRDA-specific preclinical studies necessitates further rigorous investigation. Future research must focus on validating the molecular mechanism in FRDA patient-derived cell models, determining optimal dosing and tissue distribution, and exploring potential off-target effects to ensure safety and efficacy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kim et al., 2011; Treebak et al., 2009).

Pioglitazone (Actos),"Proposal for Pioglitazone (Actos)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pioglitazone (marketed as Actos) is a synthetic thiazolidinedione compound originally developed and approved as an insulin sensitizer for type 2 diabetes mellitus. It belongs to the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of therapeutic compounds, which act as selective agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). These compounds were discovered through efforts to find insulin sensitizers and have since been extensively used in metabolic disorders to improve glucose uptake, regulate lipid metabolism, and modulate inflammatory responses (García‐Giménez, Sanchis‐Gomar, & Pallardó, 2011). The structural design of pioglitazone allows it to bind to PPARγ, triggering transcriptional activation of genes primarily involved in adipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Its established pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, with decades of clinical use in the diabetic population, make it an attractive candidate for drug repurposing in other conditions that share overlapping mechanistic abnormalities with type 2 diabetes, such as mitochondrial energy deficits and oxidative stress observed in neurodegenerative diseases like Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) (Mancuso, Orsucci, Choub, & Siciliano, 2010; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, pioglitazone has been used for the management of diabetes due to its ability to enhance insulin sensitivity. This clinical application is supported by robust biochemical and clinical evidence demonstrating that PPARγ activation improves metabolic homeostasis (Pizcueta et al., 2023). Notably, pioglitazone has also been shown in preclinical studies to generate neuroprotective effects in models of neurodegeneration, including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, by modulating inflammatory responses and improving mitochondrial bioenergetics (Mollo et al., 2019). In the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, there has been limited direct clinical investigation; a search on ClinicalTrials.gov for “Pioglitazone AND Friedreich’s Ataxia” returned only one trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris, 2008). Preclinical studies in FRDA cellular models and animal systems, including KIKO mice that recapitulate features of frataxin deficiency, have demonstrated that pioglitazone can upregulate PGC-1α and the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), leading to improved mitochondrial respiration and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (Marmolino et al., 2010; Unknown Reference). These findings, together with evidence from similar neurodegenerative conditions, support the hypothesis that pioglitazone might beneficially impact mitochondrial function and antioxidant defenses in FRDA (García‐Giménez, Sanchis‐Gomar, & Pallardó, 2011; Marmolino et al., 2010).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of action of pioglitazone lies in its capacity to activate PPARγ, a nuclear receptor that, upon binding its ligand, forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). This heterodimer then binds to PPAR response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes, thus regulating transcription. One key downstream effect of PPARγ activation is the upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), which is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism (Mancuso et al., 2010; Unknown Reference). PGC-1α, in turn, orchestrates the transcription of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, including components of the electron transport chain, and antioxidant enzymes such as mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and catalase. In FRDA, a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a deficiency of frataxin, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are central pathological features. Frataxin deficiency impairs the synthesis of iron–sulfur clusters necessary for mitochondrial respiratory chain function, leading to reduced ATP production and increased ROS (García-Giménez et al., 2011; Marmolino et al., 2010). By increasing PGC-1α expression, pioglitazone is expected to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defenses, thereby partially compensating for the mitochondrial deficits seen in FRDA (Marmolino et al., 2010; Unknown Reference). Moreover, PPARγ activation is also associated with anti-inflammatory effects, which could be beneficial in mitigating secondary neurodegeneration associated with oxidative stress and mitochondrial failure (Pizcueta et al., 2023; Morató et al., 2013).

At the molecular level, pioglitazone has been shown to increase the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, such as those encoding mitochondrial enzymes, and to upregulate adiponectin, which further enhances mitochondrial metabolic efficiency. Additionally, by promoting the expression of SOD2 and catalase, the drug is expected to reduce oxidative stress by quenching superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, respectively, thereby protecting cells from ROS-induced damage (Unknown Reference; Kearney, Orrell, Fahey, & Pandolfo, 2012). This molecular cascade of PPARγ activation → PGC-1α upregulation → enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant enzyme expression forms the critical underpinning for the therapeutic rationale in FRDA, where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in disease progression (Marmolino et al., 2010; Unknown Reference).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed in vitro assay using FRDA patient fibroblasts, the expected effect of pioglitazone is multifaceted. Firstly, by binding to PPARγ, pioglitazone should lead to the upregulation of PGC-1α, which is typically downregulated in frataxin-deficient cells. As PGC-1α levels rise, there is an anticipated increase in the transcription of mitochondrial and antioxidant genes, which should result in an improved mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Specifically, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis is expected to elevate the levels of key proteins such as SOD2 and catalase, helping to mitigate the high ROS levels observed in FRDA (Marmolino et al., 2010; Unknown Reference).

Secondly, an increase in antioxidant enzyme activity should lead to a reduction in oxidative damage, thereby stabilizing cellular redox states and improving overall cellular viability. The improvement in mitochondrial respiration, as measured by oxygen consumption rate (OCR), is expected to be a direct consequence of enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and function, ultimately leading to a partial restoration of cellular ATP levels. Additionally, while some studies indicate that pioglitazone may demonstrate only modest effects on frataxin expression itself, the overall enhancement of the mitochondrial network and the bolstering of the antioxidant defense system are thought to yield functional improvements sufficient to slow disease progression in FRDA (Unknown Reference; Pandolfo et al., 2022).

Since FRDA pathology is characterized by increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and compromised energy metabolism, upregulation of PGC-1α and the subsequent restoration of enzymes essential for ROS detoxification are critical. FRDA patient fibroblasts are known to exhibit blunted responses to oxidative challenges, such as hydrogen peroxide exposure; treatment with pioglitazone is therefore hypothesized to normalize the induction of these antioxidant enzymes, thereby reducing oxidative damage and improving cell survival (Marmolino et al., 2010; Unknown Reference). In preclinical models, for instance, KIKO mice treated with pioglitazone showed significant increases in mitochondrial antioxidant markers without a profound change in frataxin levels, suggesting that the therapeutic benefit may be derived primarily from improved mitochondrial function and enhanced oxidative stress resistance (Unknown Reference).

Overall Evaluation:
The comprehensive literature review supports the notion that pioglitazone is a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on its mechanism of action and its effects on mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defenses. One of the key strengths of pioglitazone is its well-characterized clinical safety profile and established pharmacokinetics, which ease the translation from preclinical studies to human clinical trials (Mancuso et al., 2010; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Its molecular mechanism—activation of PPARγ leading to upregulation of PGC-1α and subsequent enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant enzyme expression—is directly relevant to the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying FRDA (Marmolino et al., 2010; Unknown Reference).

Another strength highlighted by multiple studies is the ability of PPARγ agonists to restore impaired mitochondrial function, as evidenced by improved oxygen consumption and reduced ROS production in both cellular and animal FRDA models (Marmolino et al., 2010; Unknown Reference). Moreover, pioglitazone’s capacity to induce antioxidant defenses, particularly through the upregulation of SOD2 and catalase, is critically important given the high oxidative stress burden in FRDA patients (Unknown Reference; Kearney, Orrell, Fahey, & Pandolfo, 2012).

However, there remain certain weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Clinical evidence specifically targeting FRDA with pioglitazone is still very limited; only one clinical trial has been recorded and much of the supportive data come from preclinical models. Furthermore, while pioglitazone has been effective in diabetic and certain neurodegenerative contexts, its impact on frataxin expression in FRDA has been somewhat inconsistent, with some studies noting only minor direct effects on frataxin levels. This suggests that the therapeutic benefit might predominantly arise from improvements in mitochondrial function and redox balance rather than from a substantial correction of frataxin deficiency per se (Unknown Reference; García‐Giménez, Sanchis‐Gomar, & Pallardó, 2011).

Additionally, the safety profile of pioglitazone, though well established in the treatment of diabetes, presents potential concerns when repurposed for FRDA—especially given that FRDA patients often develop cardiomyopathy and other cardiac complications. Side effects such as fluid retention, weight gain, and an increased risk of heart failure are known with TZD drugs, and these risks must be carefully balanced against the potential neurological benefits in FRDA (Morató et al., 2013; Pizcueta et al., 2023).

From a mechanistic standpoint, the hypothesis that pioglitazone will improve mitochondrial respiration through PPARγ activation and subsequent PGC-1α upregulation is well supported by a series of biochemical studies. These studies demonstrate that increasing PGC-1α leads to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and improved antioxidant enzyme expression—a process that can theoretically counteract the mitochondrial deficits observed in FRDA (Marmolino et al., 2010; Unknown Reference). Furthermore, the convergence of improved mitochondrial dynamics, oxidative stress reduction, and modulation of energy metabolism aligns very well with the core pathological processes in FRDA, lending strong mechanistic credibility to the candidate’s potential (Pandolfo et al., 2022; Pizcueta et al., 2023).

In summary, pioglitazone’s established safety profile, its robust mechanism as a PPARγ agonist capable of upregulating PGC-1α and antioxidant defenses, and evidence from preclinical models collectively argue in favor of its repurposing for Friedreich’s Ataxia. While direct clinical data in FRDA are still limited, the convergence of biochemical, cellular, and animal model findings suggests that pioglitazone could have a meaningful therapeutic impact on mitochondrial respiration and oxidative stress parameters typical of FRDA pathology. Key challenges remain, including the need to optimize dosing regimens to achieve sufficient central nervous system (CNS) penetration without exacerbating cardiac risk factors, and the necessity for further clinical trials to confirm efficacy in FRDA patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris, 2008; Morató et al., 2013; Unknown Reference).

Overall, our evaluation indicates that pioglitazone should be considered a promising candidate for further investigation in Friedreich’s Ataxia, with the potential to address multiple facets of the disease’s mitochondrial and oxidative pathology. The next steps would include focused preclinical studies in FRDA-specific models and well-designed early-phase clinical studies in FRDA patients to address the translational gaps and to determine both efficacy and safety in this vulnerable population (Mancuso et al., 2010; Unknown Reference; Pizcueta et al., 2023).

Spermidine,"Proposal for Spermidine

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Spermidine is a naturally occurring polyamine present in cells and abundant in the diet through foods such as aged cheese, wheat germ, nuts, and soybeans. Its endogenous synthesis occurs via the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) pathway and it is also produced by gut microbes. As a small molecule, spermidine belongs to the polyamine class of compounds, which have been recognized for their roles in cellular proliferation, autophagy regulation, and modulation of mitochondrial function. Historically, polyamines were discovered in the mid-twentieth century and have since been associated with diverse cellular processes including modulation of oxidative stress, gene expression, and protein translation. In particular, spermidine has garnered attention for its ability to induce autophagy—a process essential for cellular quality control—by modulating acetyltransferase activity and influencing posttranslational modifications such as the hypusination of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). This compound, therefore, represents a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of conditions characterized by impaired autophagy and mitochondrial quality control such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (Al-Habsi et al., 2022; Zimmermann et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Spermidine’s therapeutic potential has been explored in a range of preclinical models across aging, neurodegeneration, and cardioprotection, where its ability to enhance autophagic flux and mitochondrial bioenergetics has led to lifespan extension and improved cellular function. In multiple studies, spermidine treatment in murine and Drosophila models has been shown to restore mitochondrial ATP production, enhance mitochondrial respiration, and improve fatty acid oxidation by activating mitochondrial trifunctional protein, a crucial regulator of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation processes (Al-Habsi et al., 2022; Hofer et al., 2021). Clinical and epidemiological investigations, such as those emerging from human dietary intake studies (e.g., the Bruneck study), have supported an inverse correlation between spermidine consumption and cognitive decline, underscoring its potential translational benefits in age-related neurodegenerative diseases (Hofer et al., 2021). Although spermidine itself has not been directly trialed in Friedreich’s Ataxia, its mechanism of action parallels other therapeutic strategies that aim to restore mitochondrial quality and boost autophagy—such as rapamycin, which has been evaluated in FRDA models to promote mitochondrial and antioxidant defenses (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015; Bürk, 2017). In veterinary and clinical settings, while spermidine’s safety profile remains favorable due to its natural occurrence in food, its use has primarily been in the context of aging research rather than an established treatment for FRDA or other inherited mitochondrial disorders (Xu et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, spermidine exerts its effects by inducing macroautophagy, a critical cellular degradation pathway that facilitates the removal of damaged proteins and organelles through the formation of autophagosomes. One of the best-characterized mechanisms involves the inhibition of the acetyltransferase EP300, thereby reducing protein acetylation and subsequently de-repressing autophagic gene expression. Additionally, spermidine is essential for the hypusination of eIF5A—a unique posttranslational modification necessary for the translation of specific autophagy-related proteins such as ATG3. This modification not only boosts autophagic flux but is also closely linked to enhanced mitochondrial protein translation and stability, ultimately leading to an elevation in mitochondrial respiration and ATP production (Hofer et al., 2021; Zimmermann et al., 2023).

Spermidine also directly interacts with mitochondrial enzymes; for example, it reportedly binds to the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP) complex with high affinity (Kd ~0.1 mM), thereby allosterically enhancing fatty acid β-oxidation. This interaction supports improved mitochondrial fuel utilization and energy generation, which is particularly important in cells suffering from mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition to its metabolic actions, spermidine alleviates oxidative stress by suppressing overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and reducing the initiation of apoptosis under conditions of cellular stress (Al-Habsi et al., 2022; Fairley et al., 2023).

Furthermore, the compound modulates mitophagy—the selective autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria—by upregulating key mediators such as PINK1 and Parkin, which are critical for marking dysfunctional mitochondria for degradation. The activation of these pathways is pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control, especially in tissues with high energy demands, such as neuronal and cardiac tissues, which are profoundly affected in FRDA (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015; Fairley et al., 2023). Therefore, spermidine’s multitarget mechanism comprising autophagy induction, mitochondrial enzyme activation, mitigation of oxidative stress, and enhancement of mitophagy forms the basis for its hypothesized therapeutic benefit in FRDA.

Expected Effect:
In the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, where frataxin deficiency leads to mitochondrial iron accumulation, impaired iron–sulfur cluster synthesis, increased ROS production, and compromised mitochondrial ATP production, the expected effect of spermidine would be multifold. By activating autophagy, spermidine should promote the clearance of damaged mitochondria and reduce the cellular burden of dysfunctional organelles. This activity is anticipated to restore mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and elevate ATP production by ensuring that only functionally competent mitochondria are retained within the cell (Al-Habsi et al., 2022; Fairley et al., 2023).

Moreover, spermidine-induced upregulation of mitophagy via the PINK1/Parkin pathway should lead to a reduction of oxidative stress markers by eliminating mitochondria that overproduce ROS. In FRDA patient fibroblasts, where defective mitochondria accumulate due to impaired autophagic turnover, such intervention is expected to lower intracellular oxidative stress and ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, by enhancing the activity of mitochondrial trifunctional proteins, spermidine may further improve fatty acid oxidation efficiency and cellular energy metabolism. In functional assays, these actions would translate to improved mitochondrial respiration parameters, increased cell viability, and restoration of energy homeostasis, thereby addressing the bioenergetic deficits observed in FRDA cells (Fairley et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2016).

At the molecular level, increased expression of autophagy markers such as LC3 and P62 and increased levels of mitophagy regulators (e.g., PINK1/Parkin) in FRDA fibroblasts upon spermidine treatment would support the hypothesis. Consistent with data from neurodegenerative models, enhanced autophagic flux would likely correlate with improved mitochondrial quality control and ATP generation, thereby compensating for the frataxin deficiency-induced metabolic impairments (Bürk, 2017; Xu et al., 2020).

Overall, the expected phenotypic outcome in treated FRDA patient fibroblasts would be a significant reduction in the proportion of damaged mitochondria accompanied by restoration of Δψm and increased ATP levels, which could ultimately improve cellular function and survival—a therapeutic effect highly desirable in disorders characterized by mitochondrial insufficiency (Calap-Quintana et al., 2015; Fairley et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
The evidence collected from multiple preclinical studies and mechanistic investigations supports the hypothesis that spermidine may be a promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its natural occurrence and dietary presence suggest favorable tolerability and an established safety profile in long-term administration, making it an attractive candidate for repurposing. The compound’s dual action—in inducing macroautophagy and boosting mitophagy via the PINK1/Parkin pathway—aligns well with the pathological mechanisms observed in FRDA, where mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and defective organelle turnover are central features (Al-Habsi et al., 2022; Fairley et al., 2023; Bürk, 2017).

Strengths of spermidine include its multifaceted mechanism of action: it not only activates autophagic pathways to clear damaged mitochondria but also enhances mitochondrial respiration and ATP production via the activation of mitochondrial trifunctional protein. This integrated approach directly addresses the bioenergetic deficits and oxidative stress observed in FRDA and similar mitochondrial disorders. Additionally, the extensive preclinical data demonstrating lifespan extension and neuroprotection in various animal models lends further support to its therapeutic potential (Al-Habsi et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2020).

However, several weaknesses and challenges remain. While the majority of evidence is derived from models of aging and neurodegeneration—such as Alzheimer’s disease and tauopathy models—direct experimental data in FRDA models are limited to indirect mechanistic rationales based on shared mitochondrial dysfunction. There is no direct clinical or robust preclinical data demonstrating effectiveness in FRDA patient fibroblasts or in animal models of FRDA specifically. This gap indicates the need for dedicated studies to assess the pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and dosing of spermidine in FRDA-relevant systems (Watchon et al., 2024). Moreover, it will be important to confirm that the molecular targets of spermidine—such as the mitochondrial trifunctional protein and the eIF5A hypusination machinery—are expressed and functionally relevant in FRDA patient cells, particularly fibroblasts, to ensure that the proposed mechanisms are operative in the intended target population (Fairley et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2016).

In conclusion, despite the current lack of direct clinical evidence in FRDA, the preclinical and biochemical rationale for using spermidine as a repurposed therapeutic candidate is strong, based on its ability to promote autophagy and mitophagy, restore mitochondrial function, and enhance cellular ATP production. These actions address key pathophysiological features of FRDA, notably mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. The compound’s favorable oral tolerability and established safety profile further support its developmental feasibility. However, further studies are warranted to directly evaluate spermidine’s efficacy in FRDA models and to optimize its dosing regimen in FRDA patient fibroblasts and, eventually, in clinical trials (Al-Habsi et al., 2022; Fairley et al., 2023; Bürk, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Overall, spermidine represents a promising candidate for further investigation in Friedreich’s Ataxia, with the potential to improve mitochondrial clearance, restore bioenergetic capacity, and ameliorate disease progression through its multifaceted molecular actions.

Resveratrol,"Proposal for Resveratrol

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol originally isolated from grapes, red wine, berries, and other plant sources. It belongs to the stilbene class of compounds and is renowned for its antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties. Initially identified for its potential cardioprotective effects in the context of the “French Paradox,” resveratrol has since been extensively studied for neuroprotective and metabolic benefits. Its synthesis from natural sources involves extraction from plant matrices, while chemical synthesis and modification have been developed to improve bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties. As a representative member of polyphenolic compounds, resveratrol has been employed in various preclinical models to mitigate oxidative stress and to activate cellular stress response pathways, particularly those involving sirtuins. Its overall safety profile, compounded by its ubiquity in the human diet, renders it a low‐risk therapeutic candidate for further development in chronic neurodegenerative conditions such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) (Edzeamey et al., 2024; Clay et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
Resveratrol’s therapeutic history spans several decades, primarily focused on its antioxidant effects, improvement of mitochondrial function, and potential roles in cancer chemoprevention, cardiovascular protection, and neuroprotection. In various preclinical studies, resveratrol has been demonstrated to activate SIRT1 – a NAD⁺‐dependent deacetylase – and to induce the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α; these actions have been associated with enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and reduced oxidative stress, critical elements in the pathology of several neurodegenerative diseases. Preclinical evidence in models of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases similarly underscores its capacity to modulate mitochondrial respiration, decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and support cellular metabolism. In the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, early clinical trials including an open-label pilot study (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011) and a subsequent randomized double-blind crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019) have explored resveratrol or its micronized formulations, although outcomes have been modest with respect to frataxin levels. In FRDA fibroblasts, resveratrol increased antioxidant gene expression and produced modest increases in frataxin; however, studies using patient-derived neurons have yielded less convincing effects, highlighting a cell-type differential response (Georges et al., 2019). Still, its widespread investigation across diseases tied to mitochondrial dysfunction, along with its documented safety in long-term human consumption, provides historical precedence that supports its repurposing for FRDA (Marmolino, 2011; Zesiewicz et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
The predominant mechanism of action of resveratrol is its activation of SIRT1, a critical NAD⁺-dependent deacetylase that modulates the activity of several transcriptional regulators including PGC-1α. Upon activation, SIRT1 deacetylates PGC-1α, thereby enhancing its transcriptional activity and ultimately promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and improved oxidative phosphorylation. PGC-1α, often referred to as the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, drives the expression of nuclear respiratory factors and mitochondrial transcription factors that are essential for the synthesis and function of new mitochondria. This cascade is particularly significant in the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, where mitochondrial impairment and reduced ATP production are central to the disease pathology. Additionally, resveratrol’s antioxidant properties help in directly scavenging ROS by virtue of its polyphenolic structure, as well as upregulating endogenous antioxidant systems through pathways connected to NRF2. These molecular interactions have been well described in neurodegenerative models, wherein resveratrol treatment leads to enhanced oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and increased ATP production, concomitant with a reduction in oxidative damage to mitochondrial components. In vitro studies have demonstrated that resveratrol-induced SIRT1 activation can lead to improved mitochondrial dynamics (including balanced fission/fusion processes) and bioenergetics, with evidence suggesting that such effects may be cell-type dependent, as observed in fibroblasts versus iPSC-derived neurons from FRDA patients (Shaito et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2016). Moreover, activation of SIRT1 is also associated with a potential stabilization of frataxin protein, either directly or indirectly through improved mitochondrial milieu and reduced oxidative stress, although direct evidence for frataxin stabilization in patient neurons remains limited (Marmolino et al., 2010; Clay et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
In the context of FRDA patient-derived neuronal models, the expected effect of resveratrol is a multi-faceted enhancement of mitochondrial function and cellular resilience. By activating SIRT1, resveratrol is hypothesized to increase PGC-1α-driven mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to an elevated number of functional mitochondria and an associated increase in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and ATP production. This biochemical shift is expected to combat the energy deficit that is a hallmark of FRDA, where frataxin deficiency precipitates a cascade of mitochondrial impairments. Additionally, due to its robust antioxidant activity, resveratrol is expected to lower ROS levels within neurons, thereby reducing oxidative damage to mitochondrial and cellular components—a key aspect of FRDA pathology. The proposed mechanism also suggests that enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and improved redox balance could indirectly contribute to the stabilization of frataxin protein levels, mitigating the downstream consequences of frataxin deficiency. Given that SIRT1, and consequently PGC-1α, are expressed in neuronal tissues, the design of the assay—supposedly utilizing patient-derived neurons—provides a relevant platform to evaluate these effects. Importantly, resveratrol’s action is not solely limited to isolated mitochondrial parameters; its pleiotropic effects on cellular signaling may also improve neuronal survival and function, as indicated by modest clinical improvements in neurological scores (e.g., FARS) observed in high-dose clinical trials, even though these studies did not report significant changes in frataxin levels (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019; Zesiewicz et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
Resveratrol emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia based on its well-characterized molecular profile, particularly via the activation of SIRT1 and subsequent induction of PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis. Its natural origin, dietary presence, and extensive investigation in neurodegenerative models provide a strong basis for its further evaluation. The strengths of resveratrol as a therapeutic candidate are several-fold. First, its ability to enhance mitochondrial function addresses a core aspect of FRDA pathology—mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from frataxin deficiency. Second, its antioxidant properties can help mitigate the oxidative stress that drives neurodegeneration in FRDA. Third, the overall safety profile and historical human exposure to resveratrol considerably lower the developmental risks associated with its repurposing. Moreover, its demonstrated effects in activating SIRT1 and enhancing mitochondrial dynamics in preclinical models suggest potential improvements in OCR and ATP generation, which are critical for neural viability and function (Shaito et al., 2023; Tiberi et al., 2023).

Nonetheless, several weaknesses temper the enthusiasm for resveratrol. The clinical data in Friedreich’s Ataxia remains limited and somewhat inconclusive; while some studies in fibroblasts and pilot trials have demonstrated modest improvements in clinical parameters and antioxidant markers, translation to patient-derived neurons has shown less consistent results. Notably, studies using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons have indicated that resveratrol may not effectively increase frataxin protein levels in the most disease-relevant cell types, which could limit its therapeutic efficacy (Georges et al., 2019). Additionally, the bioavailability of resveratrol is a well-documented challenge. Given its rapid metabolism and limited systemic exposure, achieving therapeutically relevant concentrations in target tissues such as the brain and heart may necessitate specialized formulations, such as micronized versions, whose clinical performance is still under evaluation (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019; Edzeamey et al., 2024). Furthermore, the hypothesized indirect stabilization of frataxin via improved mitochondrial health, while mechanistically plausible, is supported by only limited direct evidence. Thus, the expected benefits on frataxin stability, OCR, and ATP production remain to be definitively verified in rigorous, controlled clinical studies.

In conclusion, resveratrol exhibits a strong mechanistic rationale for its repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia, particularly through the activation of SIRT1 and induction of PGC-1α, leading to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and potential improvements in cellular energy metabolism. The compound’s antioxidant properties further add to its appeal as a candidate that can target multiple pathological features of FRDA, including mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. However, the mixed preclinical results in patient-derived neuronal models, combined with the challenges related to its bioavailability and limited clinical evidence in FRDA, indicate that further comprehensive studies are warranted. Such studies should focus on optimizing delivery methods, confirming the molecular effects on frataxin stability and mitochondrial function in relevant cellular models, and ultimately conducting well-powered clinical trials to establish definitive efficacy. Overall, while resveratrol represents a promising therapeutic candidate with a favorable safety profile and well-understood biochemical actions, its application in Friedreich’s Ataxia will require careful, targeted investigation to overcome the current limitations and establish its true clinical benefit (Clay et al., 2019; Edzeamey et al., 2024; Zesiewicz et al., 2020).

"MitoTEMPO

**","Proposal for MitoTEMPO

**Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:**
MitoTEMPO is a synthetic, mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that was developed by conjugating the piperidine nitroxide moiety TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl) to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) cation. The attachment via a suitable alkyl chain enables the compound to accumulate selectively within mitochondria driven by the negative membrane potential. This design allows MitoTEMPO to function as a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic by catalytically dismutating superoxide radicals into less reactive species. Belonging to the broader class of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants (MTAs), compounds in this category have been engineered to overcome the limitations of conventional antioxidants that often fail to reach the mitochondrial matrix at effective concentrations. Historically, MTAs have been synthesized and evaluated to protect against a variety of oxidative stress–related injuries, with proof-of-concept studies demonstrating enhanced protection in in vitro and in vivo models of diseases involving mitochondrial dysfunction (Fields et al., 2023; Szeto, 2006). The design principles underlying MitoTEMPO are similar to other MTAs such as MitoQ, which has demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in preclinical models, thereby establishing a precedent for the therapeutic utility of this class of compounds in conditions characterized by mitochondrial oxidative damage.

**Therapeutic History:**
MitoTEMPO has been extensively studied in preclinical models as a mitochondrial-targeted ROS scavenger. Its protective effects have been demonstrated primarily in models of acute oxidative injury. For instance, Du et al. (2017) reported that MitoTEMPO significantly attenuated acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in mice by selectively reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress markers, preventing mitochondrial permeabilization, and ultimately reducing cell death. Beyond hepatotoxicity, MitoTEMPO has been evaluated in several neuronal disease models; its capacity to improve oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and reduce mitochondrial ROS has been demonstrated in models of Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Fields et al., 2023; Szeto, 2006). In contrast, a search specifically for “MitoTEMPO AND Friedreich's Ataxia” in clinical trial databases via ClinicalTrials.gov yielded no registered studies (ClinicalTrials.gov). However, the underlying pathology in Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) bears significant resemblance to the mitochondrial dysfunction seen in neurodegenerative diseases where MitoTEMPO has shown promise; FRDA is characterized by mitochondrial iron accumulation, impaired iron–sulfur (Fe-S) cluster protein function, and elevated oxidative stress (Napoli et al., 2006; Rodríguez et al., 2020). These studies support the rationale for repurposing MitoTEMPO for FRDA, especially given the molecule’s established stability and therapeutic feasibility in various animal models.

**Mechanism of Action:**
The therapeutic action of MitoTEMPO is rooted in its dual functional design: the nitroxide moiety and the mitochondrial targeting moiety. The nitroxide group acts as a catalytic SOD mimetic, neutralizing superoxide radicals by converting them into hydrogen peroxide, which in turn is rapidly detoxified by endogenous enzymes such as catalase or glutathione peroxidase. This activity is critical because superoxide anions, if not removed, can react to form other highly reactive species, including peroxynitrite, which can lead to oxidative inactivation of proteins, lipids, and DNA (Du et al., 2017). The targeting component, derived from the TPP⁺ cation, ensures that MitoTEMPO accumulates several hundred-fold within the mitochondrial matrix compared to the cytosol, due to the organelle’s highly negative membrane potential. This selective accumulation is crucial for effectively neutralizing the mitochondrial ROS that originate predominantly at the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes during oxidative phosphorylation. In models of oxidative stress, including those relevant to neurodegeneration, the reduction in mitochondrial ROS has been correlated with preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential, prevention of mitochondrial permeabilization, and protection against apoptotic signaling cascades (Du et al., 2017; Fields et al., 2023). In the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, frataxin deficiency disrupts the biosynthesis and maintenance of Fe-S clusters—critical cofactors for several mitochondrial enzymes such as complexes I and III, as well as enzymes involved in heme synthesis (Napoli et al., 2006; Rodríguez et al., 2020). The elevated mitochondrial ROS in FRDA can oxidatively damage these Fe-S proteins, further impairing mitochondrial bioenergetics and establishing a vicious cycle of dysfunction. By scavenging superoxide, MitoTEMPO is hypothesized to protect these Fe-S cluster proteins from oxidative inactivation, thereby preserving the function of mitochondrial enzymes, restoring maximal respiration, and increasing spare respiratory capacity (hypothesis). This mechanism aligns with the demonstrated biochemical improvements observed in other models where mitochondrial oxidative stress was mitigated, leading to observed increases in oxygen consumption and improved cellular bioenergetics (Fields et al., 2023; Tiberi et al., 2023).

**Expected Effect:**
Given its mechanism of action, the proposed expected effect of MitoTEMPO in FRDA is multifaceted. First, by accumulating selectively within the mitochondria of FRDA cells, it is expected to rapidly quench superoxide radicals. This targeted quenching is anticipated to lower the overall oxidative burden within the mitochondria, reducing the formation of secondary reactive species that exacerbate cellular damage (Edzeamey et al., 2024). As FRDA is characterized by impaired Fe-S cluster protein stability due to oxidative stress, MitoTEMPO’s scavenging activity should prevent the oxidative inactivation of these proteins. Preservation of Fe-S clusters is critical because these clusters are integral to the function of various mitochondrial enzymes, particularly complex I of the ETC. Complex I dysfunction is known to impair overall mitochondrial respiration and reduce ATP production, which is a central feature in FRDA pathology as observed in patient fibroblasts and neuronal models (Napoli et al., 2006; Rodríguez et al., 2020). By protecting these essential proteins, MitoTEMPO could restore normal electron flow through the ETC, thereby improving oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and boosting overall ATP production, which is expected to translate into improved cell viability and function. Moreover, the scavenging of mitochondrial ROS may help suppress the induction of oxidative stress–responsive signaling pathways that lead to further mitochondrial damage and apoptotic cell death. This is particularly important in neurons and cardiomyocytes, cell types that are severely affected in FRDA and rely heavily on optimal mitochondrial function for survival (Rodríguez et al., 2020). In addition, restoration of maximal respiration and enhancement of spare respiratory capacity may provide FRDA cells with a better capacity to respond to energy demands and stress, thereby improving not only basal but also stress-induced mitochondrial performance. Finally, there is an expectation that by mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, MitoTEMPO might indirectly influence the dysregulated Nrf2 antioxidant pathway observed in FRDA, potentially leading to an overall improvement in cellular antioxidant defenses, as seen in other antioxidant strategies that enhance Nrf2 signaling (La Rosa et al., 2020; Tiberi et al., 2023).

**Overall Evaluation:**
Based on the extensive review of the biomedical, biochemical, and preclinical literature provided, MitoTEMPO presents a promising yet unvalidated candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia therapy. One of the greatest strengths of MitoTEMPO is its well-documented mechanism as a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant. By virtue of its structural design that pairs the antioxidant TEMPO moiety with a TPP⁺ cation, MitoTEMPO rapidly accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix and effectively scavenges superoxide radicals. This targeted action is particularly valuable in FRDA, where mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are central to the disease’s pathogenesis, leading to the inactivation of critical Fe-S cluster proteins and compromised ETC activity (Napoli et al., 2006; Rodríguez et al., 2020). Furthermore, the compound has demonstrated efficacy in various preclinical models—including hepatotoxicity models and several neurodegenerative disease models—indicating that its antioxidant properties translate into meaningful physiological protection (Du et al., 2017; Szeto, 2006). The favorable pharmacokinetic and stability profiles reported in animal models further support its feasibility for translation in repurposing efforts (Fields et al., 2023).

A significant weakness, however, is the lack of direct experimental or clinical evidence for MitoTEMPO in Friedreich’s Ataxia specifically. Although the rationale for its use is strong, based on its mechanism of reducing mitochondrial ROS and protecting Fe-S cluster proteins, no studies to date have directly evaluated its impact on FRDA cellular or animal models. This represents a key gap that must be addressed in future preclinical studies. Additionally, while reducing oxidative stress is undoubtedly beneficial in FRDA, the disease’s multifactorial etiology—which includes altered iron metabolism, defective frataxin expression, and subsequent metabolic disturbances—suggests that MitoTEMPO may need to be used in combination with other therapeutic agents to fully restore mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis (Rodríguez et al., 2020; Tiberi et al., 2023). There is also a potential concern regarding the complexity of translating antioxidant therapy from non-neuronal tissues (such as the liver, where much of the hepatotoxicity studies have been performed) to the central nervous system or cardiac tissues, which are critical targets in FRDA. The blood–brain barrier penetration and distribution to affected tissues in FRDA remain significant challenges that must be addressed during further development.

In summary, MitoTEMPO is a well-characterized mitochondrial antioxidant with a mechanistic profile that aligns well with the pathophysiological features of Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its ability to accumulate within mitochondria, scavenge superoxide, and prevent oxidative damage offers a compelling rationale for its repurposing in FRDA. Strengths include its targeted mode of action, robust preclinical efficacy in models of oxidative stress, and potential for restoring mitochondrial respiration by preserving the function of Fe-S cluster proteins critical for electron transport. Conversely, its weaknesses rest primarily with the absence of FRDA-specific data and challenges related to effective delivery to disease-relevant tissues such as neurons and cardiomyocytes. Overall, while further preclinical validation specifically within FRDA models is necessary, the scientific basis and preclinical evidence from related disease contexts support the potential of MitoTEMPO as a promising candidate warranting additional investigation in the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia (Napoli et al., 2006; Du et al., 2017; Tiberi et al., 2023).

AICAR,"Proposal for AICAR

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside) is a synthetic nucleotide analogue originally discovered for its capacity to mimic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) in cellular metabolism. Chemically, AICAR is converted intracellularly by adenosine kinase into its ribonucleotide form, ZMP, which functions as an AMP mimetic. This compound belongs to the class of AMPK agonists, a subcategory of metabolic regulators designed to modify cellular energy homeostasis. Historically, compounds of this class have been utilized in both basic research and preclinical studies to simulate the metabolic effects of exercise, essentially by accelerating the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The activation of AMPK by such nucleotide analogues has been widely acknowledged to directly stimulate energy sensors within the cell, thereby shifting the metabolic balance toward enhanced catabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. This agent’s ability to directly activate AMPK without requiring energy depletion has rendered it a valuable tool in metabolic research as well as a potential therapeutic candidate for diseases with underlying mitochondrial dysfunction (Komen & Thorburn, 2014, pp. 10–11; Rai et al., 2015, pp. 9–10).

Therapeutic History:
AICAR has seen extensive use in biochemical and preclinical studies due to its capacity to stimulate AMPK activity. In various animal models, particularly murine systems, AICAR administration has been shown to promote oxidative metabolism, increase mitochondrial content, and improve endurance performance by inducing the expression of genes that govern mitochondrial biogenesis, especially through the phosphorylation of the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1α. Its efficacy has been documented in models of muscle dystrophy, cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, and other mitochondrial myopathies, where mitochondrial dysfunction is a central phenomenon. Moreover, AICAR has been investigated in patient-derived fibroblasts with complex I deficiency, where treatment improved bioenergetic profiles and reduced oxidative stress (Komen & Thorburn, 2014, pp. 10–11; Rai et al., 2015, pp. 9–10). Although AICAR is approved for use in indications like hyperinsulinemia, its oral bioavailability, particularly in humans, is limited. In clinical contexts, there is only sparse evidence with a single clinical trial registered examining its role in modulating mitochondrial parameters in diseases that could share mitochondrial deficits with Friedreich’s Ataxia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). There is, however, preclinical evidence from models of mitochondrial dysfunction—such as in complex I or COX deficiencies—that supports the biochemical rationale for repurposing AICAR to treat conditions like Friedreich’s Ataxia, where similar disturbances in mitochondrial energy metabolism exist (Coppi et al., 2021, pp. 19–20; El-Hattab et al., 2017, pp. 1–9).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, AICAR’s mechanism of action is well characterized: it functions as an AMP analogue that is phosphorylated inside cells to form ZMP. This molecule mimics the physiological actions of AMP and binds to the γ-subunit of AMPK, thus promoting its phosphorylation—and subsequent activation—by upstream kinases such as LKB1 or CaMKK. Once activated, AMPK orchestrates multiple downstream effects. A prime target of AMPK activation is PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. Phosphorylation of PGC-1α by AMPK increases its activity, leading to enhanced transcription of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid oxidation, and energy production. Additionally, AMPK stimulation may indirectly modulate the activity of other regulatory molecules such as SIRT1 and affect mTORC1 activity, further contributing to changes in cellular metabolism (Komen & Thorburn, 2014, pp. 10–11; Marmolino et al., 2010, pp. 4–7). In models of Friedreich’s Ataxia, where PGC-1α signaling is blunted resulting in reduced mitochondrial biogenesis, AICAR’s capacity to act upstream of PGC-1α is viewed as a potential means to restore impaired mitochondrial function. The biochemical interactions involved include not only the direct phosphorylation events but also subsequent coactivation of transcription factors like NRF1/2, YY1, and ERR that coordinate the synthesis and assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes. In effect, AICAR’s stimulation of the AMPK/PGC-1α axis is anticipated to restore ATP-linked respiration and increase the spare respiratory capacity of cells—a critical consideration in FRDA where energy deficits contribute to neurodegeneration (Komen & Thorburn, 2014, pp. 2–3; Rai et al., 2015, pp. 9–10; Marmolino, 2011, pp. 115–119).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for Friedreich’s Ataxia is that treatment with AICAR will mimic the effects of elevated AMP levels in patient fibroblasts, leading to direct activation of AMPK and an ensuing cascade that raises the expression and activity of PGC-1α. In FRDA, diminished PGC-1α signaling is implicated in reduced mitochondrial biogenesis and impaired antioxidant responses, notably with decreased levels of enzymes such as SOD2. By activating AMPK, AICAR is expected to boost PGC-1α levels, thereby inducing mitochondrial biogenesis and enhancing the overall mitochondrial mass as well as the functional capacity of the mitochondria to generate ATP. In detail, one would anticipate that AICAR treatment will lead to:

1. Increased phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172, triggering its activation even in the absence of a severe cellular energy deficit.
2. Upregulation of PGC-1α expression and activity, which is known to be a key factor regulating mitochondrial replication and gene expression.
3. Enhanced transcription of mitochondrial proteins and enzymes leading to greater assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes.
4. Restoration of ATP-linked respiration and a higher spare respiratory capacity, as measured by increased oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in preclinical assays.
5. Improved antioxidant defense via upregulation of enzymes such as SOD2, addressing the oxidative stress that is a hallmark of FRDA pathology (Marmolino et al., 2010, pp. 4–7; Marmolino, 2011, pp. 122–128; Nightingale et al., 2016, pp. 10–11).

These effects have been demonstrated in several in vitro studies using patient-derived fibroblasts, where treatment with 2 mM AICAR showed significant upregulation of both PGC-1α and SOD2, suggesting that activation of AMPK indeed restores mitochondrial antioxidant defense and biogenesis pathways. Additionally, in vivo animal models involving mitochondrial dysfunction have shown improvements in oxidative phosphorylation parameters with AICAR treatment, though its clinical translation in Friedreich’s Ataxia specifically remains to be rigorously tested (Marmolino, 2011, pp. 132–135; Tischner & Wenz, 2015, pp. 18–20).

Overall Evaluation:
AICAR represents a promising therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on its well-established ability to activate AMPK and stimulate the downstream PGC-1α pathway—critical steps in mitochondrial biogenesis and energy homeostasis. Strengths of AICAR include its extensive evidence base in preclinical models demonstrating improved mitochondrial function, enhanced OCR, and increased mitochondrial mass, all of which are desirable therapeutic endpoints in FRDA, where mitochondrial energy deficits are a core pathological feature (Komen & Thorburn, 2014, pp. 10–11; Rai et al., 2015, pp. 9–10; Sorrentino et al., 2018, pp. 7–9). Its mechanism of directly mimicking AMP is particularly advantageous because it bypasses the requirement for a prolonged energy deficit to activate AMPK and can acutely trigger metabolic shifts. Moreover, detailed biochemical studies corroborate that AICAR increases PGC-1α activity and enhances the transcription of mitochondrial genes, suggesting that it might effectively restore ATP-linked respiration and spare respiratory capacity in FRDA patient cells (Marmolino et al., 2010, pp. 4–7; Coppi et al., 2021, pp. 19–20).

However, there are notable weaknesses. One significant challenge is AICAR’s poor oral bioavailability (<5%), which limits its direct clinical utility unless alternative administration routes are developed or new formulations are engineered (Coppi et al., 2021, pp. 19–20). Additionally, its penetration through the blood–brain barrier is limited, which might complicate its therapeutic effectiveness in the central nervous system—a critical consideration in neurodegenerative conditions such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (Komen & Thorburn, 2014, pp. 10–11). There is also the possibility of off-target effects or compensatory metabolic responses due to chronic AMPK activation. Furthermore, while many preclinical studies support its favorable impact on mitochondrial function, there is a dearth of direct clinical trial data in FRDA patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Another consideration is that the variability in responses across different tissues observed in other mitochondrial disease models means that even if AICAR improves mitochondrial biogenesis in peripheral tissues, its effects in the heart, spinal cord, or cerebellum—tissues critically affected in FRDA—may not be as robust (Kanabus et al., 2014, pp. 1798–1817; Komen & Thorburn, 2014, pp. 11–12).

In summary, the overall evaluation of AICAR as a therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia is cautiously optimistic. Its established mode of action as an AMPK activator that elevates PGC-1α and enhances mitochondrial biogenesis is highly relevant to the mitochondrial deficits observed in FRDA. The strengths lie in its reproducible preclinical efficacy in improving mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and in boosting antioxidant defenses. The weaknesses pertain primarily to its pharmacokinetic limitations and uncertain central nervous system penetration, as well as the limited clinical trial experience specifically targeting FRDA. Nonetheless, further investigative studies, including optimization of delivery methods and dosage formulations, appear warranted to fully delineate its repurposing potential. Continued research could clarify whether these preclinical benefits can translate into meaningful clinical improvements in FRDA patients (Rahman, 2015, pp. 5–6; Nightingale et al., 2016, pp. 9–10; Tischner & Wenz, 2015, pp. 20–23).

"SRT1720

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of SRT1720 as a candidate therapeutic for Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA):","Proposal for SRT1720

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of SRT1720 as a candidate therapeutic for Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA):

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SRT1720 is a fully synthetic small‐molecule activator of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) that was originally discovered through high‐throughput screening programs aimed at finding compounds that could overcome the limitations of natural SIRT1 activators such as resveratrol. It belongs to the class of imidazo[1,2-b]thiazole compounds and was developed following extensive medicinal chemistry efforts to improve potency, specificity, and pharmacokinetic properties relative to polyphenolic natural products. The molecule’s design was predicated on modifying the structural features of resveratrol in order to preserve the “calorie restriction–mimetic” biological effects – notably those attributable to SIRT1 activation – while circumventing problems such as low solubility, poor bioavailability, and nonspecific binding. In this context, SRT1720 represents a next‐generation synthetic SIRT1 activator designed to engage SIRT1 via an allosteric mechanism that lowers the Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) for substrate(s) and expedites deacetylase activity. Its chemical synthesis and structure–activity relationship examinations have been described in several studies, where variations of the imidazo[1,2-b]thiazole scaffold were explored to optimize the potency and selectivity of SIRT1 activation (Granchi & Minutolo, 2018; Höppner et al., 2014). As such, SRT1720 is classified among sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs) that are structurally distinct from natural polyphenols and have been investigated for their capacity to modulate metabolic pathways, inflammatory responses, and mitochondrial function.

Therapeutic History:
SRT1720 and related compounds have primarily been studied for their beneficial effects in preclinical models of metabolic dysfunction including type 2 diabetes mellitus, diet-induced obesity, and cardiovascular pathology. Preclinical studies in rodents have demonstrated that SRT1720 administration improves insulin sensitivity, enhances glucose homeostasis, reduces inflammatory markers, and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis by activating SIRT1 (Sauve, 2009; Andreux et al., 2013). In animal models, oral dosing of SRT1720 led to improvements in metabolic parameters, reduced fat accumulation, and protected various tissues – including liver and kidney – from ischemic and oxidative injuries (Funk, 2012). The compound even extended lifespan in obese mice by mimicking the beneficial effects associated with calorie restriction. Importantly, despite these encouraging preclinical outcomes, there is no direct evidence that SRT1720 has been tested either in clinical trials or in preclinical models specifically for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Searches using key databases (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov) have yielded no records of clinical trials investigating SRT1720 or related SIRT1 activators in FRDA (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In contrast, other compounds targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress – such as pioglitazone or Nrf2 activators – have been the subject of repurposing studies in FRDA (Clay et al., 2019; Rufini et al., 2022). Thus, while SRT1720’s therapeutic history in metabolic and cardiovascular indications is well documented in the preclinical literature, its use in neurodegenerative conditions marked by frataxin deficiency and mitochondrial impairment remains to be established.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, SRT1720 acts as an allosteric activator of SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase enzyme that plays a critical role in multiple cellular processes including energy metabolism, inflammation, DNA repair, and mitochondrial biogenesis. SIRT1’s enzymatic activity is normally limited by substrate availability and by the levels of NAD+ in the cell; SRT1720 binds to the enzyme-substrate complex and lowers the Km for its peptide substrates, thereby enhancing deacetylase activity (Sinclair & Hubbard, 2013; Sauve, 2009). One of the key downstream targets of SIRT1 is the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). Under normal conditions, PGC-1α is acetylated and held in an inactive state; upon deacetylation by SIRT1, PGC-1α becomes activated, translocates to the nucleus, and upregulates the transcription of a broad network of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. This includes the stimulation of nuclear respiratory factors (NRF-1 and NRF-2) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA), which drive the replication of mitochondrial DNA and the expression of mitochondrial proteins (Andreux et al., 2013; Funk, 2012). Furthermore, SRT1720 has been demonstrated in preclinical models to not only improve mitochondrial respiratory flux but also to increase ATP production, likely by boosting the overall mitochondrial capacity of cells affected by metabolic stress (Funk, 2012). In addition to directly impacting mitochondrial biogenesis, SRT1720 can modulate inflammation by deacetylating p65 – a subunit of NF-κB – thereby suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (Granchi & Minutolo, 2018; Gueguen et al., 2014). Although some studies have questioned whether the activation of SIRT1 in vitro might be substrate-dependent (especially when fluorophore-tagged peptide substrates are used), multiple independent lines of evidence from in vivo rodent studies support the conclusion that SRT1720 does indeed enhance SIRT1 activity, leading to improvements in mitochondrial dynamics and metabolic function (Sauve, 2009; Sinclair & Hubbard, 2013).

Expected Effect in FRDA:
The central hypothesis for repurposing SRT1720 in Friedreich’s Ataxia hinges on its ability to reverse the downregulation of SIRT1 that has been observed in FRDA patient fibroblasts, and thereby rescue downstream pathways mediated by PGC-1α. In FRDA, frataxin deficiency leads to impaired mitochondrial function, accumulation of oxidative stress, and reduced ATP production. Several studies in FRDA models have documented decreased PGC-1α expression and a consequent failure to mount an adequate mitochondrial biogenesis response in the face of cellular stress (Marmolino et al., 2010; Clay et al., 2019). By pharmacologically activating SIRT1, SRT1720 is expected to promote deacetylation of PGC-1α, thereby facilitating its activation and nuclear translocation. Once activated, PGC-1α would drive the transcription of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial replication and oxidative phosphorylation, leading to an increase in mitochondrial number, enhanced respiratory flux, and higher ATP yields. In cell-based assays performed in vitro – such as those using FRDA patient fibroblasts – one could measure a decrease in PGC-1α acetylation levels concomitant with an increase in the expression of mitochondrial markers including components of the respiratory complexes and mtDNA copy number (Funk, 2012; Manjula et al., 2021). This improved mitochondrial function should theoretically translate into enhanced cellular bioenergetics and a reduction in oxidative damage, which are central to the pathology of FRDA. Because mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of FRDA, augmenting mitochondrial biogenesis via the SIRT1–PGC-1α axis is a plausible strategy to restore energy homeostasis in affected cells (Andreux et al., 2013; Sanchis-Gomar et al., 2014). Furthermore, since SRT1720 has demonstrated the capacity to be administered orally with acceptable pharmacokinetic profiles in rodent models, and given its prior safety profile in these preclinical investigations (Granchi & Minutolo, 2018; Sauve, 2009), there is a strong rationale for its evaluation in FRDA cell systems as a means of improving mitochondrial respiratory function and ATP production.

Overall Evaluation:
Based on the comprehensive review of the literature, SRT1720 appears to be a scientifically promising candidate for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia, especially given the central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the disease’s etiology. The strengths of SRT1720 as a therapeutic candidate include its potent and relatively selective activation of SIRT1; its well-documented ability in multiple preclinical models to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, respiratory function, and ATP synthesis; and its oral bioavailability with favorable pharmacokinetic parameters established in rodent studies (Sauve, 2009; Andreux et al., 2013). These characteristics reinforce the hypothesis that by reversing the SIRT1 deficiency observed in FRDA cells, SRT1720 could reactivate the PGC-1α signaling pathway, thereby stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis and ultimately improving the cellular energy balance in patients with FRDA.

Nonetheless, several challenges remain that temper this enthusiasm. First, while SRT1720’s metabolic benefits have been well established in models of diabetes and obesity, there is a noticeable lack of data directly addressing its efficacy in models of neurodegeneration or in the specific context of FRDA. No preclinical studies to date have directly evaluated SRT1720’s effects on frataxin expression or mitochondrial function in FRDA patient-derived cells or animal models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Second, some controversy persists regarding the assay methodologies used to demonstrate SIRT1 activation by SRT1720, with some reports suggesting that the compound’s effects may be dependent on the presence of fluorophore-tagged substrates in vitro, which could limit the translational significance of such data (Sinclair & Hubbard, 2013; Sauve, 2009). Third, the off-target effects and potential adverse reactions associated with first-generation SIRT1 activators like SRT1720 need to be carefully assessed before moving forward with clinical studies, especially given the complex pathophysiology of FRDA that involves both central and peripheral mitochondrial defects (Granchi & Minutolo, 2018; Chang et al., 2024). Lastly, while its oral pharmacokinetics in rodents are encouraging, reliable data on its pharmacokinetic profile in humans are absent, which could present hurdles in the drug development pipeline.

In conclusion, SRT1720 exhibits several mechanistic attributes that are in line with the therapeutic needs of Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its ability to activate SIRT1 and, consequently, stimulate the deacetylation and activation of PGC-1α provides a direct rationale for its use to restore mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism in FRDA cells. This approach directly tackles the mitochondrial dysfunction and energy deficit observed in FRDA – a disease marked by frataxin deficiency and resultant impaired mitochondrial function. Thus, while further preclinical studies specifically designed to evaluate SRT1720 in FRDA models are warranted, the existing body of literature in related metabolic and mitochondrial paradigms supports its potential utility. The strengths of SRT1720 lie in its potent activation of SIRT1, its documented capacity to enhance mitochondrial function, and its oral bioavailability in preclinical models; however, careful consideration must be given to assay-dependent activation mechanisms and potential off-target effects. Overall, SRT1720 represents a promising candidate for further investigation in the therapeutic landscape of Friedreich’s Ataxia, provided that subsequent studies reaffirm its efficacy in disease-specific models and elucidate its safety profile in a clinical context (Manjula et al., 2021; Andreux et al., 2013).

Dynasore,"Proposal for Dynasore

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Dynasore is a cell‐permeable small molecule originally discovered through high‐throughput chemical screening designed to identify inhibitors of clathrin‐mediated endocytosis. Its discovery was driven by the need to impede the GTPase activity of dynamin family proteins, and over time dynasore was established as a powerful tool compound in cell biology. As a synthetic agent, its chemical scaffold was optimized to block the intrinsic GTPase activity that is critical for the conformational changes of dynamin proteins. In particular, dynasore has been shown to inhibit Dynamin 1 and Dynamin 2, as well as the dynamin‐related protein 1 (DRP1), a key mediator of mitochondrial fission (Chen et al., 2023; Misrani et al., 2021). Since DRP1 regulates mitochondrial division by hydrolyzing GTP—a process required for its self-assembly into ring- or spiral-like structures that constrict the mitochondrial outer membrane—dynasore’s inhibition of this activity has notable implications for mitochondrial dynamics. This compound belongs to the class of dynamin inhibitors and has been widely used as a research reagent to interrogate both endocytic and mitochondrial fission pathways in various cellular systems (Clemente et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2023). Its synthetic origins enable investigators to access a molecule that is not only potent but can be applied across a range of experimental models, thereby accelerating efforts to repurpose it for conditions characterized by excessive mitochondrial fragmentation, such as Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA).

Therapeutic History
Throughout its research history, dynasore has been utilized primarily as a tool to dissect underlying cellular processes. Initially, its key application lay in studies of clathrin‐mediated endocytosis, where dynasore’s inhibition of dynamin activity provided critical insights into vesicular trafficking and receptor internalization. Subsequent studies expanded its use to examining mitochondrial dynamics. In particular, research has demonstrated that by inhibiting DRP1—the dynamin‐related protein responsible for mitochondrial fission—dynasore can reduce the extent of mitochondrial fragmentation in in vitro models. Preclinical studies in neuronal cells have shown that interfering with DRP1’s function can lead to improved mitochondrial integrity, a finding of great relevance to neurodegenerative conditions (Grohm et al., 2012; Oliver & Reddy, 2019). For example, in models of spinal cord injury, dynasore administration improved motor function recovery by decreasing neuronal apoptosis and astrocytic proliferation, highlighting its potential neuroprotective capacity (Li et al., 2017). Although clinical applications specifically targeting Friedreich’s Ataxia have not yet been reported, the extensive preclinical evidence in models of Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders demonstrates that targeting mitochondrial dynamics with dynasore may be a viable approach. In addition, the compound has been used experimentally to modulate intracellular iron uptake and reduce oxidative damage via off‐target effects, which further points toward its pleiotropic impact in mitigating stress‐related cell death in neurons (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Oliver & Reddy, 2019).

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, dynasore exerts its effects by directly inhibiting the GTPase activity of dynamin family proteins. Under normal conditions, DRP1 is largely cytosolic but is recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane in response to cellular cues that demand mitochondrial division. Upon recruitment, DRP1 oligomerizes into ring-like structures around the mitochondria and hydrolyzes GTP to generate the mechanical force required for membrane constriction and subsequent fission (Reddy et al., 2011; Oliver & Reddy, 2019). Dynasore binds to the GTPase domain of DRP1 and related dynamins, thereby impairing their capacity to bind or hydrolyze GTP. This impedes the conformational changes necessary for oligomerization and membrane scission, effectively reducing the rate of mitochondrial fission (Martinez et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2019).

In addition to its direct inhibition of DRP1, dynasore has been documented to have additional cellular activities. For instance, its use in neuronal models has revealed that dynasore can reduce intracellular iron uptake by interfering with dynamin‐dependent endocytosis of transferrin receptors—a process that ultimately reduces the availability of iron for mitochondrial operations—and also acts as a radical-trapping antioxidant that scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Clemente et al., 2020; Misrani et al., 2021). These ancillary effects, while complicating the precise attribution of outcomes entirely to DRP1 inhibition, may confer additional cytoprotective benefits by mitigating iron-induced oxidative stress, a common feature in neurodegenerative conditions and FRDA.

From a structural standpoint, dynasore’s interference with the enzymatic cycle of DRP1 leads to a reduction in the excessive fission events that can result in fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. Mitochondrial fragmentation is detrimental given that it disrupts the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), impairs electron transport chain efficiency, and decreases ATP production (Oliver & Reddy, 2019; Reddy et al., 2011). Through the inhibition of DRP1’s GTPase activity, dynasore is expected to shift the balance toward mitochondrial fusion, thereby promoting a more interconnected and stable mitochondrial network. This shift could directly enhance oxidative phosphorylation by improving the coupling efficiency between the electron transport chain complexes and ATP synthase—a critical parameter measured by the ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (Reddy et al., 2011; Martinez et al., 2023).

The impact of dynasore on DRP1 has been further elucidated in studies that examine the downstream effects on mitochondrial quality control mechanisms such as mitophagy. In healthy cells, a balanced interplay between fission and fusion ensures that damaged mitochondria are segregated and subsequently removed via autophagic processes. In cases where excessive mitochondrial fission occurs, the efficiency of mitophagy is compromised, leading to the accumulation of depolarized and dysfunctional mitochondria. By reducing DRP1-mediated fission, dynasore may help restore mitophagic efficiency, ensuring that damaged mitochondrial fragments are appropriately targeted for degradation and removal, thereby maintaining a healthy mitochondrial population (Reddy et al., 2011; Oliver & Reddy, 2019).

Expected Effect
Friedreich’s Ataxia is characterized by a complex interplay of mitochondrial dysfunction, including impaired energy production, oxidative stress, and disruptions in mitochondrial quality control. In FRDA, frataxin deficiency leads to iron accumulation, increased cellular oxidative stress, and compromised mitochondrial bioenergetics. The proposed therapeutic hypothesis for dynasore in FRDA is that by inhibiting GTPase-dependent DRP1 activity, it will reduce excessive mitochondrial fission, promote mitochondrial fusion, and thereby stabilize the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). The anticipated result is an improvement in the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, ultimately reflected by an increase in ATP-linked OCR and overall enhanced bioenergetic function in FRDA patient neurons (Martinez et al., 2023; Oliver & Reddy, 2019).

In practice, the expected effects of dynasore in FRDA models can be broken down into several interrelated therapeutic benefits. First, by inhibiting DRP1 activity, dynasore should lead to a reduction in mitochondrial fragmentation. In FRDA, excessive fission contributes to a population of small, fragmented mitochondria that exhibit lower Δψm and an impaired capacity for ATP production. By promoting a shift towards mitochondrial fusion, dynasore is expected to help restore a more interconnected mitochondrial network. This interconnectivity is beneficial because it facilitates the distribution of mitochondrial DNA, proteins, and substrates across the network, thereby supporting more robust and efficient oxidative phosphorylation (Chen et al., 2023; Reddy et al., 2011).

Second, stabilization of Δψm is crucial for maintaining the electrochemical gradient used by ATP synthase to produce ATP. In neurons, which are highly dependent on mitochondrial ATP production for synaptic transmission and overall cellular homeostasis, the preservation of Δψm directly translates into improved functional capacity. Improvements in Δψm, driven by dynasore’s reduction of pathological fission, are expected to enhance electron transport chain activity, reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species, and promote more efficient ATP-linked respiration (Oliver & Reddy, 2019; Martinez et al., 2023).

Third, by modulating the balance of mitochondrial dynamics, dynasore may foster a cellular environment that is more conducive to effective mitophagy. In FRDA, the accumulation of damaged or depolarized mitochondria exacerbates oxidative stress and further undermines bioenergetic efficiency. By rebalancing fission and fusion, dynasore is anticipated to enable more efficient segregation and removal of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy. This, in turn, should reduce intracellular oxidative stress and improve overall mitochondrial quality, thereby sustaining the energy production demands necessary for neuronal survival (Chidipi et al., 2022; Edenharter et al., 2018).

Moreover, additional off-target effects of dynasore—such as the reduction in intracellular iron uptake and its radical-trapping antioxidant properties—could provide further therapeutic benefits in FRDA. Since FRDA is associated with mitochondrial iron overload and consequent oxidative damage, the reduction in iron availability and direct scavenging of reactive oxygen species may attenuate the oxidative stress burden on neurons. This dual action, while complicating the pure attribution to DRP1 inhibition, might synergistically complement the primary mechanism by improving mitochondrial respiration indirectly (Clemente et al., 2020; Misrani et al., 2021).

Overall, the expected effect of dynasore in an FRDA context is a cascade of beneficial cellular events: restoration of mitochondrial network morphology, stabilization of Δψm, improved electron transport and ATP-linked oxygen consumption, and enhanced clearance of damaged mitochondria through more effective mitophagy. Together, these effects should converge to improve bioenergetic parameters in FRDA patient neurons, potentially translating into neuroprotective outcomes and better cellular survival in the face of frataxin deficiency (Oliver & Reddy, 2019; Reddy et al., 2011).

Overall Evaluation
The overall evaluation of dynasore as a therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia is characterized by a cautiously optimistic perspective that acknowledges both significant strengths and notable weaknesses.

Strengths.
One of the primary strengths of dynasore lies in its well-established mechanism of action. As a potent inhibitor of dynamin family GTPases, especially DRP1, dynasore directly addresses a critical dysregulation observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, including FRDA. Excessive DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission is increasingly recognized as a contributor to mitochondrial fragmentation, diminished membrane potential, and impaired ATP production. Dynasore’s ability to inhibit the GTPase activity of DRP1 is well supported by biochemical studies demonstrating improvements in mitochondrial morphology and function upon DRP1 inhibition (Oliver & Reddy, 2019; Reddy et al., 2011). Moreover, dynasore has a history of robust performance in various experimental models, ranging from in vitro cell culture assays to in vivo studies in animal models of neurodegeneration. For instance, its demonstrated efficacy in reducing neuronal apoptosis and improving motor outcomes in spinal cord injury models provides a foundation for its potential utility in FRDA (Li et al., 2017). Additionally, by stabilizing Δψm and enhancing ATP-linked oxygen consumption through the promotion of mitochondrial fusion, dynasore targets the bioenergetic deficits that are central to FRDA pathology (Martinez et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023).

Another key strength is its cell‐permeable nature and the extensive body of preclinical research supporting its use as a research tool. The compound’s synthetic origin and the relative ease with which it is available for laboratory studies allow for rapid investigation into its mechanistic effects on mitochondrial dynamics in FRDA patient-derived neuronal cultures or animal models. This availability is pivotal for early-phase drug development programs looking to repurpose established research reagents for new therapeutic indications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Oliver & Reddy, 2019).

Weaknesses.
Notwithstanding these strengths, there are several challenges associated with repurposing dynasore for FRDA. A major concern arises from its lack of specificity. Dynasore is known to inhibit several dynamin family proteins—not only DRP1, which regulates mitochondrial fission, but also Dynamin 1 and Dynamin 2, which are essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis and other critical cellular processes. Such broad activity raises the risk of off-target effects that could disrupt neuronal functions such as synaptic vesicle recycling, potentially exacerbating cellular dysfunction in an already vulnerable FRDA neuronal population (Clemente et al., 2020; Misrani et al., 2021).

Another potential drawback is the pleiotropic nature of dynasore’s actions. In addition to inhibiting DRP1, dynasore has been reported to reduce intracellular iron uptake and to act as a direct scavenger of reactive oxygen species. While these effects might be beneficial in reducing the oxidative stress that accompanies FRDA, they confound the interpretation of results by making it difficult to attribute any observed therapeutic benefits solely to the modulation of mitochondrial fission (Clemente et al., 2020; Misrani et al., 2021). This multiplicity of action could complicate dose calibration and toxicity assessments. In scenarios where excessive inhibition of DRP1 could lead to overly fused mitochondria, there is also a risk that mitophagy—the process required for the removal of damaged mitochondria—may be impaired, resulting in the accumulation of dysfunctional organelles. Therefore, achieving an optimal therapeutic window that balances DRP1 inhibition with adequate mitochondrial turnover will be a critical challenge (Reddy et al., 2011; Oliver & Reddy, 2019).

Furthermore, though there is promising in vitro and animal model evidence on dynasore’s efficacy in modulating mitochondrial dynamics in neurodegenerative models, direct evidence of its beneficial effects in FRDA-specific models remains sparse. FRDA is a multifaceted disease characterized not only by mitochondrial fragmentation but also by frataxin deficiency, iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis impairment, and chronic oxidative stress. Without direct preclinical studies demonstrating that dynasore can restore mitochondrial membrane potential, improve ATP-linked OCR, and enhance mitophagy in FRDA models, its translation into a FRDA therapeutic remains hypothetical (Chidipi et al., 2022; Edenharter et al., 2018).

Lastly, the pharmacokinetic profile, bioavailability, and long-term toxicity of dynasore in therapeutic contexts have not yet been fully characterized. While dynasore has proven its worth as a research reagent in cellular models, its adaptation for clinical use requires extensive optimization in terms of dosing regimens and safety evaluations. This represents an additional hurdle that must be overcome before considering clinical trials in FRDA (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation and Recommendation
In summary, dynasore presents a compelling mechanistic rationale for repurposing as a therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its well-documented inhibition of DRP1’s GTPase activity offers a direct strategy to tackle the excessive mitochondrial fission that is implicated in the mitochondrial dysfunction observed in FRDA. By stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential, enhancing the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and potentially promoting more effective mitophagy, dynasore is hypothesized to ameliorate the bioenergetic deficits that contribute to neuronal degeneration in FRDA (Oliver & Reddy, 2019; Reddy et al., 2011). The extensive preclinical use of dynasore in models of neurodegeneration, along with its pivotal role as a research tool, adds further weight to the proposition of investigating its effects in FRDA-specific systems (Grohm et al., 2012; Martinez et al., 2023).

However, significant challenges remain. The lack of absolute specificity toward DRP1 and the potential for off-target inhibition of essential dynamin-related processes pose risks that must be carefully managed. The compound’s additional activities—such as modulation of intracellular iron uptake and direct antioxidant effects—while possibly beneficial, complicate the mechanistic interpretation and require precise experimental delineation. Moreover, an overly aggressive inhibition of DRP1 may disrupt the necessary balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion, potentially impairing the normal turnover of mitochondria via mitophagy and causing deleterious effects on cellular homeostasis (Reddy et al., 2011; Oliver & Reddy, 2019). Direct studies in FRDA patient-derived neurons or animal models will be critical to determine whether dynasore can deliver the anticipated improvements in Δψm stabilization, ATP-linked OCR, and overall neuronal bioenergetics without incurring unacceptable side effects.

Given these considerations, our overall evaluation is one of guarded optimism. Dynasore’s robust mechanistic basis as an inhibitor of GTPase-dependent DRP1 activity aligns well with the therapeutic needs of FRDA, where mitochondrial dysfunction is a central pathogenic feature. Its prior demonstration of efficacy in diverse neurodegenerative contexts further underscores its potential. Nonetheless, the inherent challenges relating to off-target effects, dose calibration, and the need for direct efficacy data in FRDA models cannot be overlooked. To advance dynasore as a repurposed candidate for FRDA, we recommend a systematic, multi-phase research approach that includes:

1. Detailed in vitro studies using FRDA patient-derived neuronal cultures to assess the effects of dynasore on mitochondrial morphology, membrane potential, and ATP-linked respiration. These studies should incorporate assays to monitor mitophagy efficiency and evaluate any off-target impacts on endocytic pathways.
2. In vivo testing in appropriate animal models of FRDA to evaluate the compound’s pharmacokinetic parameters, bioavailability, and neuroprotective efficacy. Long-term studies should assess whether sustained DRP1 inhibition correlates with improved motor and cognitive outcomes without perturbing essential cellular processes.
3. Dose-ranging studies to identify a therapeutic window in which dynasore can reduce excessive mitochondrial fission while preserving the minimal basal fission necessary for mitochondrial quality control.
4. Exploration of combination therapies wherein dynasore’s DRP1 inhibition is complemented by agents that target other aspects of FRDA pathology—such as compounds that enhance mitochondrial biogenesis or directly ameliorate frataxin deficiency—to achieve a more holistic correction of mitochondrial dysfunction.

In conclusion, while dynasore represents an innovative candidate with a compelling mechanism of action in theory, its successful translation from a research tool to a therapeutic agent for Friedreich’s Ataxia hinges on the resolution of several critical challenges. These include establishing its specificity, managing its pleiotropic effects, and proving its efficacy in FRDA-specific models. Given the pressing need for effective interventions in FRDA, the potential for dynasore to restore mitochondrial homeostasis remains an appealing avenue worthy of further preclinical exploration. With methodical and rigorous testing, dynasore could indeed contribute to a new generation of therapeutics aimed at correcting mitochondrial dynamics and improving bioenergetic outcomes in patients suffering from Friedreich’s Ataxia (Chen et al., 2023; Oliver & Reddy, 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

"VBIT-4

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of VBIT-4 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA):","Proposal for VBIT-4

Below is our comprehensive evaluation of VBIT-4 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA):

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
VBIT-4 is a synthetically derived small‐molecule inhibitor originally developed from a lead compound, AKOS-022, which was identified through a high-throughput screening campaign employing bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET2) assays (Ben-Hail et al., 2016). Subsequent structure–activity relationship studies led to the synthesis of several derivatives, including VBIT-3 and notably VBIT-4. VBIT-4 belongs to a novel chemical class of VDAC1 (voltage-dependent anion channel 1) inhibitors that modulate mitochondrial permeability by preventing the oligomerization of VDAC1—a process implicated in the release of pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c (Ben-Hail et al., 2016). This class of compounds has been designed to stabilize mitochondrial function by ensuring VDAC1 remains in a monomeric or non-pathological oligomer state. In several preclinical studies, molecules like VBIT-4 have been used experimentally to interfere with mitochondrial signaling pathways that normally lead to apoptosis, proving useful in models of cancer, neurodegeneration, and even diabetic complications (Ben-Hail et al., 2016; Belosludtsev et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Biochemical studies have demonstrated that VBIT-4 directly binds to purified VDAC1, thereby diminishing channel conductance and reducing its oligomerization in response to apoptotic stimuli (Ben-Hail et al., 2016). Preclinical experiments have shown that VBIT-4 can inhibit cytochrome c release from mitochondria, preserve mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and prevent the detachment of hexokinase from mitochondria, a process intricately linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis (Ben-Hail et al., 2016). While these studies have been primarily conducted in cellular models exposed to stresses like selenite, staurosporine, and cisplatin, they have not yet been specifically extended to FRDA models. Moreover, searching clinical trial databases reveals no registered studies testing VBIT-4 or other VDAC1 inhibitors in Friedreich’s Ataxia (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Thus, while VBIT-4 has shown promise in models of mitochondrial-driven apoptosis in conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes-related mitochondrial damage (Verma et al., 2022; Belosludtsev et al., 2023), its use in FRDA remains hypothetical yet highly plausible given the shared mechanistic features of mitochondrial dysfunction.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, VBIT-4 acts by directly binding to VDAC1, a protein embedded in the mitochondrial outer membrane that regulates the flux of ions, metabolites, and ATP/ADP exchange, in addition to playing a critical role in the initiation of apoptosis (Ben-Hail et al., 2016). Under pathological conditions, VDAC1 tends to form oligomers which create pores that permit cytochrome c and other apoptogenic factors to leak into the cytosol, thereby triggering caspase activation and cell death (Ben-Hail et al., 2016). VBIT-4 inhibits this oligomerization process, presumably by stabilizing VDAC1 in a conformation that is less prone to interacting with itself and with other mitochondrial proteins. As a result, it not only reduces the release of cytochrome c but also preserves the mitochondrial membrane potential, limits excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and maintains intracellular calcium homeostasis (Ben-Hail et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2023). This mechanism is supported by observations that VBIT-4 is capable of restoring ΔΨm and oxygen consumption rates (OCR) in cell models undergoing mitochondrial stress (Ben-Hail et al., 2016). Importantly, VDAC1 is expressed in all mitochondria-rich tissues, including those affected in FRDA, where mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark, rendering this target both accessible and therapeutically relevant (Shoshan-Barmatz et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
Based on its known mechanism, VBIT-4 is expected to prevent pathological VDAC1 oligomerization in FRDA mitochondria. By doing so, it should reduce the inappropriate release of cytochrome c—a critical early event in apoptosis—stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential, and consequently support efficient electron transport chain (ETC) function. Since FRDA is characterized by mitochondrial iron accumulation, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and heightened ROS-driven damage, the stabilization of mitochondrial membranes by VBIT-4 would ideally lead to improved ATP production and reduced oxidative stress (Edzeamey et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2023). This expected effect aligns with findings from other disease models where VBIT-4 has restored mitochondrial function and decreased apoptosis by preventing key pathological events such as calcium overload and ROS generation (Ben-Hail et al., 2016; Belosludtsev et al., 2023). In essence, in an FRDA assay, one would anticipate that treatment with VBIT-4 will yield preserved mitochondrial membrane potential, improved electron transport chain efficiency (OCR), and a decrease in markers of apoptosis such as cytochrome c release. Given that frataxin deficiency in FRDA leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and disturbed calcium homeostasis (Zhao et al., 2023), the application of VBIT-4 could help mitigate these deficits by targeting a central node—VDAC1—that orchestrates multiple facets of mitochondrial integrity.

Overall Evaluation:
VBIT-4 presents several strong attributes as a potential therapeutic agent for Friedreich’s Ataxia. Among its strengths is the clear mechanistic rationale: by preventing VDAC1 oligomerization, VBIT-4 addresses the core mitochondrial dysfunction that underlies apoptotic cell death. Preclinical data in various models (including those for Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes-related mitochondrial dysfunction) support its efficacy in restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, reducing ROS generation, and preserving metabolic activity (Ben-Hail et al., 2016; Verma et al., 2022). Moreover, its favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles in animal studies lend further support to the idea that it might be repurposed safely for FRDA, a disease in which long-term treatment would likely be necessary (Ben-Hail et al., 2016).

However, a significant weakness of the current dataset is the absence of direct preclinical or clinical data concerning VBIT-4 in Friedreich’s Ataxia. While the general role of VDAC1 in mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis is well documented, FRDA-specific studies—such as in FXN-deficient cell models or appropriate animal models—are lacking (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, while VBIT-4 has been well characterized in the context of apoptosis and neurodegeneration, FRDA has its own unique aspects, such as disrupted iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and altered mitochondrial calcium handling, that might require additional mechanistic validation (Zhao et al., 2023). There is also the potential for unforeseen off-target effects, as mitochondrial dynamics are complex and involve the interplay of many proteins beyond VDAC1. Furthermore, while the compound’s synthesis and chemical class have been described in preclinical reports, more detailed information regarding its chemical stability, bioavailability in tissues directly affected in FRDA (e.g., the cerebellum and dorsal root ganglia), and its long-term safety remains to be rigorously established (Ben-Hail et al., 2016).

In summary, VBIT-4 is an innovative small molecule that acts by inhibiting VDAC1 oligomerization—a pivotal event in the cascade of mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Its previously demonstrated ability to restore mitochondrial membrane potential, improve oxidative phosphorylation, and reduce ROS production in other disease models offers a compelling rationale for its application in Friedreich’s Ataxia. Although direct experimental evidence in FRDA models is currently absent, the mechanism by which VBIT-4 operates aligns closely with the pathological defects observed in FRDA, including impaired electron transport chain efficiency and increased oxidative damage. The strengths of VBIT-4 lie in its clear mechanistic action on a well-established mitochondrial target, its proven efficacy in preclinical models of related mitochondrial and neurodegenerative disorders, and its apparent safety profile in long-term administration studies. Its weaknesses include the lack of direct FRDA-related preclinical data and the need for comprehensive studies to map its pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in the specific context of FRDA. Overall, further investigation in FRDA-specific cell and animal models is warranted to validate whether VBIT-4’s mitochondrial protective effects can translate into clinical benefit for patients suffering from Friedreich’s Ataxia (Ben-Hail et al., 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Zhao et al., 2023).

Mdivi-1,"Proposal for Mdivi-1

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Mdivi-1 is a small synthetic molecule originally discovered via high-throughput screening in yeast-based assays targeting mitochondrial fission proteins. It was first characterized as an inhibitor of the yeast dynamin‐related protein Dnm1 and later was repurposed as a putative inhibitor of mammalian dynamin‐related protein 1 (DRP1) based on sequence and functional homologies. As a quinazolinone derivative, its chemical structure—featuring aromatic rings and functional groups such as chloro and methoxy substituents—belongs to a class of small molecule inhibitors that modulate mitochondrial dynamics. Its discovery emerged from efforts to find compounds that “rescue” mitochondria from excessive fragmentation by interfering with the GTPase activity involved in DRP1’s self‐assembly and fission ability (Kim et al., 2013). This class of therapeutics, often termed mitochondrial division inhibitors, has been extensively employed in in vitro and in vivo models to study and modulate mitochondrial morphology in various contexts, including neurodegenerative disease and cancer. The compound’s chemical synthesis and optimization have been driven by the need for precise modulators of mitochondrial fission, and despite some controversies regarding its exact biochemical targets, Mdivi-1 remains an important tool for probing mitochondrial function and dynamics in experimental systems (Basei & Zorzano, 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Mdivi-1 has been widely used as a research tool in biomedical studies focusing on the role of mitochondrial fission in cellular homeostasis, apoptosis, and metabolic regulation. Historically, it was applied in models of ischemia-reperfusion injury where excessive DRP1-mediated fission contributes to tissue damage and cardiomyocyte death, and it provided protection against neuronal injury in various neurodegenerative disease models (Bordt et al., 2017). Additionally, DRP1 inhibitors including Mdivi-1 have been utilized in models of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and epilepsy, with studies demonstrating improvements in mitochondrial morphology, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and enhanced cell survival (Oliver & Reddy, 2019). While direct clinical applications in Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) have not been realized—clinical trial searches for Mdivi-1 in the context of FRDA yield only early-stage exploratory studies—there is a significant body of preclinical data supporting its utility in conditions where mitochondrial dysfunction is paramount (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In similar neurodegenerative disorders characterized by mitochondrial fragmentation and bioenergetic deficits, DRP1 inhibitors have shown promise by rebalancing mitochondrial dynamics and promoting overall cellular health (Deng et al., 2022). This positions Mdivi-1 as a potentially attractive candidate for repurposing in FRDA, a disease where frataxin deficiency leads to mitochondrial pathology including fragmentation and impaired respiration (Deng et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
Mdivi-1 was originally posited to function through the selective inhibition of DRP1’s GTPase activity, a critical enzyme function required for mitochondrial fission. DRP1, a dynamin-related GTPase, normally translocates from the cytosol to the mitochondria where it oligomerizes and forms ring-like structures around the mitochondrial outer membrane to initiate fission. Inhibition of DRP1 by Mdivi-1 was thought to occur through an allosteric mechanism that prevents the conformational changes and self-assembly necessary for its GTPase function, thereby reducing mitochondrial fragmentation and favoring a more elongated, fused network (Kim et al., 2013). However, subsequent studies have revealed that the mechanism of Mdivi-1 may be more complex than a simple DRP1 inhibitor. Evidence indicates that at commonly used concentrations, Mdivi-1 may also act by reversible inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, leading to modulation of ROS production and influencing cellular bioenergetics independently of direct DRP1 inhibition (Bordt et al., 2017; Marx et al., 2024). Despite these debates, numerous studies have demonstrated that treatment with Mdivi-1 results in a reduction of DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission, restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), improvements in oxygen consumption rates (OCR), and enhanced cell survival under oxidative stress conditions (Basei & Zorzano, 2023; Oliver & Reddy, 2019). The compound interferes with DRP1’s ability to hydrolyze GTP—a process essential for its fission activity—by binding either to allosteric sites or interfering with protein-protein interactions that facilitate its mitochondrial recruitment. Furthermore, the documented effects on mitochondrial dynamics have been supported by changes in the expression levels of fusion proteins such as mitofusins (Mfn1, Mfn2) and optic atrophy protein 1 (Opa1) in treated cells, suggesting a coordinated rebalancing of fission–fusion processes (Oliver & Reddy, 2019). Collectively, although controversies remain regarding the precise molecular target of Mdivi-1, the consensus is that its protective effects in various disease models are mediated, at least in part, by its capacity to inhibit DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation and thereby improve mitochondrial function (Deng et al., 2022; Koch & Traven, 2019).

Expected Effect:
In the context of Friedreich’s Ataxia, where frataxin deficiency precipitates mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by excessive fission, reduced ATP production, and impaired oxidative phosphorylation, the treatment hypothesis posits that Mdivi-1 will restore the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion. By inhibiting DRP1’s fission-promoting activity, Mdivi-1 is expected to reduce pathological mitochondrial fragmentation observed in FRDA fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. This should lead to preservation or restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), enhancement of ATP-linked respiration, and improvement of maximal OCR, indicative of a more efficient and robust oxidative phosphorylation process (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Basei & Zorzano, 2023). Several studies using DRP1 inhibitors in neurodegenerative models have demonstrated increased cell viability and reduced apoptosis under conditions of oxidative or metabolic stress, outcomes that are directly relevant to the pathophysiologic mechanisms in FRDA (Reddy, 2014; Oliver & Reddy, 2019). Moreover, the expected molecular effects include improved mitophagy, which can allow for better quality control of damaged mitochondria, thereby indirectly contributing to enhanced bioenergetic capacity and mitigation of cellular stress. In the proposed assays, DRP1 expression is well established in FRDA fibroblasts and neuronal cells, affirming that these cells possess the requisite machinery for DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission. Consequently, the application of Mdivi-1 is anticipated to result in a shift towards mitochondrial elongation and improved network connectivity, correlating with increased respiratory function and cellular energy status (Yu et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Mdivi-1 emerges as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for Friedreich’s Ataxia based on its mechanistic rationale and extensive preclinical history. One of its major strengths lies in its established use as a research tool to modulate mitochondrial dynamics, along with a substantial body of evidence demonstrating that DRP1 inhibition can attenuate mitochondrial fragmentation, enhance mitochondrial respiration, and improve cell survival in various disease models (Oliver & Reddy, 2019; Reddy, 2014). Its known dosing ranges—from in vitro concentrations of 1 to 50 µM to effective in vivo applications in animal models—provide a solid foundation for translational studies in FRDA (Kim et al., 2013; Koch & Traven, 2019). The expected restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential and bioenergetic parameters in FRDA fibroblasts and iPSC-derived neurons aligns with the molecular hypothesis that reducing excessive DRP1-mediated fission will improve mitochondrial integrity and function in these cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Basei & Zorzano, 2023).

However, there are notable challenges and potential weaknesses that must be considered. Foremost among these is the ongoing controversy regarding Mdivi-1’s primary mechanism of action. Several studies suggest that its beneficial effects might be mediated through reversible inhibition of mitochondrial complex I rather than direct DRP1 inhibition (Bordt et al., 2017; Marx et al., 2024). This dual mechanism introduces complexity in interpreting the outcomes, as complex I inhibition may lead to off-target effects that could compromise mitochondrial function if not tightly regulated. Furthermore, despite promising preclinical data in other neurodegenerative and ischemia-related models, direct evidence of efficacy in Friedreich’s Ataxia models is limited, necessitating more rigorous testing (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Oliver & Reddy, 2019). The specificity of DRP1 inhibition by Mdivi-1 is also questioned by some reports where the compound does not fully recapitulate phenotypes observed by genetic knockdown of DRP1, suggesting that the compound’s effects might be context-dependent and variable across different cell types and disease models (Reddy, 2014; Zerihun et al., 2023).

Additionally, while Mdivi-1’s capacity to improve mitochondrial morphology is documented, the long-term consequences of chronic DRP1 inhibition remain unclear. Mitochondrial fission is an essential physiological process required for quality control, cell division, and adaptation to metabolic stress; therefore, its complete suppression might lead to unforeseen deleterious effects, particularly in tissues that rely heavily on mitochondrial turnover and energy production (Whitley et al., 2019; Sridharan, 2023). Safety, dosing optimization, and specificity of action are all critical parameters that need further validation in preclinical FRDA models. Moreover, given the complex interplay between mitochondrial biogenesis, fission, fusion, and mitophagy in FRDA pathogenesis, it will be important to ensure that Mdivi-1 not only prevents excessive fission but also permits adequate mitochondrial turnover and repair mechanisms (Ghani, 2025).

In summary, Mdivi-1 represents a candidate with a compelling mechanistic basis for repurposing in Friedreich’s Ataxia. Its strengths lie in its well-documented ability to modulate mitochondrial dynamics, improve mitochondrial function, and reduce oxidative stress in a variety of cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative disease. The transition of these benefits to FRDA models is supported by the observation that mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired bioenergetics are core pathological features of FRDA. Nonetheless, the controversial aspects of its mechanism—specifically, the potential contribution of complex I inhibition—and the need for further evidence regarding long-term safety and efficacy in FRDA-specific systems present challenges that must be addressed through rigorous preclinical testing before clinical translation can be confidently pursued (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Basei & Zorzano, 2023).

Overall, the repurposing of Mdivi-1 for FRDA is scientifically plausible and supported by a significant body of mechanistic and experimental data across multiple disease models. Its ability to inhibit DRP1-mediated fission and thereby rebalance mitochondrial dynamics offers a clear strategy to counteract the bioenergetic deficits observed in FRDA. However, the candidate’s dual mechanism of action, potential off-target effects, and the necessity for comprehensive efficacy and safety studies are critical areas that require further exploration. In our role as a drug development team, these considerations will inform the design of preclinical experiments aimed at rigorously testing Mdivi-1 in FRDA-specific models, with the ultimate goal of determining its viability as a therapeutic agent that can be translated into clinical studies for this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Marx et al., 2024; Oliver & Reddy, 2019).
