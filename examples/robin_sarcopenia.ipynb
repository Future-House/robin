What are the optimal protocols and reagents for establishing a high-throughput fluorescent or luminescent calcium transient assay in aged human skeletal myotubes, including dye selection, genetically encoded Ca²⁺ sensor optimization, automation integration, assay sensitivity, dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratio, and reproducibility metrics?\n",
      "2. Which small-molecule screening platforms and library compositions have demonstrated success in identifying modulators that restore calcium signaling and contractile function in patient-derived or aged human myotube models, and what validation assays confirmed their target engagement, dose-response relationships, and functional rescue of muscle contraction?\n",
      "3. What published data exist on the efficacy and mechanism of action of small-molecule SERCA activators in aging skeletal muscle, including quantitative measurements of SR Ca²⁺ reuptake rates, improvements in twitch and tetanic force in ex vivo or in vivo sarcopenia models, and analyses of off-target effects or isoform specificity?\n",
      "4. What are the latest reported small-molecule modulators of ryanodine receptor (RyR) stabilization or junctophilin–RyR interactions that have been tested in aged human or rodent sarcopenic muscle models, including evidence of reduced pathological Ca²⁺ leak, enhanced transient amplitude, improved fatigue resistance, and in vivo muscle strength restoration?\n",
      "5. Which candidate compounds with known pharmacokinetic, ADME, and safety profiles—particularly oral bioavailability, skeletal muscle tissue penetration, metabolic stability, and human tolerability data—have been evaluated for modulating calcium-handling proteins in preclinical models of muscle aging or related myopathies?\n",
      "6. What are the key molecular mechanisms driving sarcopenia-associated dysregulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis in aged human skeletal muscle, including roles of oxidative post-translational modifications on RyR1, SERCA pump downregulation, altered ER–mitochondrial Ca²⁺ exchange, and store-operated calcium entry channel dysfunction?\n",
      "7. Which genetic, transcriptomic, or proteomic studies provide strong validation that specific calcium-handling proteins such as SERCA1/2, RyR1, STIM1, or Orai1 play causative roles in sarcopenia pathophysiology, ideally including knockout or patient mutation analyses in aged myotube or animal models with functional readouts?\n",
      "8. What is the contribution of chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress to impairment of Ca²⁺ transients in aged myotubes, including cytokine-mediated kinase cascades, redox modifications of calcium channels, and downstream effects on sarcomere structure and contractile apparatus integrity?\n",
      "9. What are the emerging contractile function assays for aged skeletal muscle cells—such as impedance-based measurements, traction force microscopy, high-throughput optogenetic or electrical stimulation—and how do these technologies correlate with calcium transient amplitude, kinetics, and fatigue profiles in sarcopenia models?\n",
      "10. What preclinical or early clinical studies report detailed ADME, pharmacokinetic, and safety data for novel SERCA activators, RyR stabilizers, or store-operated calcium entry modulators, including plasma half-life, tissue distribution to skeletal muscle, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacodynamic target engagement, and early efficacy signals?\n",

While its primary development has been in heart failure, the mechanism of improving calcium handling and contractile function in muscle cells has theoretical relevance to counteracting age-related declines in skeletal muscle performance. No direct preclinical data in sarcopenia exist, but extensive in vivo safety and PK data from clinical heart failure studies indicate a manageable risk profile at therapeutic doses and established routes of administration. Key risks include arrhythmias at supratherapeutic levels and off-target cardiac effects, but these are well characterized and can be monitored.\n",
      "\n",
      "Candidate 2 (Dantrolene) is a ryanodine receptor blocker that reduces Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, effectively producing muscle relaxation. Its approved use in malignant hyperthermia and spasticity rests on its muscle-weakening properties, which run counter to the goals of improving strength and mass in sarcopenia. Chronic use carries known risks of hepatotoxicity, sedation, and profound muscle weakness. There is no supportive evidence that blunting Ca2+ release can restore or enhance muscle mass or function in aged skeletal muscle; on the contrary, it may exacerbate weakness. Preclinical or clinical data for sarcopenia are absent, and the MoA is mechanistically misaligned with the pathology. The safety and tolerability profile is poor for a chronic therapy aimed at increasing muscle strength.\",\n",

      "  \"Reasoning\": \"Between the two, Istaroxime offers a more direct approach to enhancing skeletal muscle contractility via SERCA activation and improved calcium recycling, with an existing clinical safety database and defined PK/PD parameters. Although neither candidate has been explicitly tested in sarcopenia models, Istaroxime’s mechanism addresses a core dysfunction in aged muscle—impaired calcium handling—and risks can be managed based on heart failure experience. Dantrolene, by contrast, induces muscle relaxation and carries hepatotoxicity and sedation liabilities, fundamentally opposing the therapeutic goal of reversing muscle loss and weakness. Therefore, Istaroxime (ID: 3) is superior for a translational program in sarcopenia.\",\n",

Preclinical studies in rodent models of heart failure and ageing have shown improved excitation–contraction coupling and reduced muscle fatigue, suggesting relevance to sarcopenia. However, most data come from cardiac or cardiac‐skeletal cross‐talk models, with limited direct evidence in aged skeletal muscle or functional sarcopenia endpoints. Mechanistically, the MoA is clear and directly targets a core pathology (Ca2+ dysregulation) in muscle fibres. But JTV519 has known off‐target effects on RyR2 in cardiac tissue, raising safety concerns (arrhythmias, hypotension) and uncertain muscle‐specific PK/PD. Its drug‐delivery feasibility for skeletal muscle (bioavailability, dosing) and human safety profile remain poorly defined. No clinical human data exist for sarcopenia, and failures in other muscle‐related indications have not been reported but remain unexplored.\n",

      "Candidate 2: Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is an NAD+ precursor with extensive preclinical and emerging clinical data. In aged mice, NR supplementation restores NAD+ levels, enhances mitochondrial biogenesis, improves muscle oxidative capacity, and attenuates age‐related muscle decline. Phase I/II human trials demonstrate safety, tolerability, oral bioavailability, and NAD+ boosting in blood and tissues. While the mechanism (enhancing sirtuin activity, mitochondrial health) is more indirect than targeting excitation–contraction coupling, it addresses a central upstream driver of sarcopenia—mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired cellular energy metabolism. NR has a well‐characterized safety profile, minimal off‐target toxicity, and a feasible oral dosing regimen. Direct evidence in human muscle function is emerging, with early signals of improved performance in aged cohorts. This repurposed nutraceutical approach carries lower translational risk.\",\"Reasoning\":\"While JTV519 offers a more direct MoA against Ca2+ leak, its safety profile, lack of human data in skeletal muscle, and unclear PK/PD pose high translational risk. In contrast, nicotinamide riboside combines strong, directly relevant preclinical evidence in aged muscle models, a clear upstream mechanism in mitochondrial health, and an established safety and bioavailability profile in human trials. These factors collectively confer a higher probability of successful experimental outcomes and eventual clinical translation in sarcopenia.\",\"Winner\":\"(Nicotinamide riboside, 39)\",\"Loser\":\"(JTV519, 36)\"}\n"
