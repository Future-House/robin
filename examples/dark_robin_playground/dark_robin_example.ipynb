      "2025-06-13 16:43:10,881 - robin.mesh_hypotheses - INFO - Hypotheses Generated from MeSH Terms:\n",
      "2025-06-13 16:43:10,882 - robin.mesh_hypotheses - INFO - 1. <**Hypothesis**: Viral infections trigger epigenetic modifications in intestinal epithelial cells, altering tight junction protein expression and creating a permeable barrier that facilitates gluten peptide translocation and immune activation in genetically susceptible individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rationale**: Recent evidence suggests viral infections can induce lasting epigenetic changes. Rotavirus and other enteric viruses are associated with celiac disease onset, potentially through chromatin remodeling affecting barrier function genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Therapeutic Implications**: Epigenetic modulators like HDAC inhibitors or DNA methyltransferase inhibitors could restore normal tight junction expression, reducing intestinal permeability and preventing gluten-induced inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MeSH terms**: Celiac Disease/virology, Epigenesis Genetic, Tight Junctions, Intestinal Mucosa/pathology>\n",
      "\n",
      "<**Hypothesis**: Parasitic helminths modulate regulatory T-cell populations through metabolic reprogramming, and their absence in developed countries contributes to loss of immune tolerance to dietary antigens including gluten proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rationale**: The hygiene hypothesis suggests reduced parasitic exposure correlates with autoimmune disease prevalence. Helminths induce Treg expansion through metabolic shifts favoring oxidative phosphorylation over glycolysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Therapeutic Implications**: Controlled helminth therapy or metabolic modulators that mimic helminth-induced Treg metabolic profiles could restore immune tolerance and prevent or treat celiac disease in susceptible populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MeSH terms**: Celiac Disease/parasitology, T-Lymphocytes Regulatory, Cell Metabolism, Immune Tolerance>\n",
      "\n",
      "<**Hypothesis**: Dysregulated tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment that paradoxically promotes Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17-mediated tissue damage in celiac disease patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rationale**: Tryptophan catabolism through IDO1/TDO2 produces kynurenine metabolites. While generally immunosuppressive, certain kynurenines can promote Th17 responses under inflammatory conditions, explaining celiac pathology.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Therapeutic Implications**: Selective inhibition of specific kynurenine pathway enzymes or kynurenine receptor antagonists could rebalance immune responses, reducing Th17-mediated inflammation while preserving beneficial immunoregulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**MeSH terms**: Celiac Disease/metabolism, Tryptophan, Kynurenine, Th17 Cells, Interleukin-17>\n",
      "\n",
      "<**Hypothesis**: Congenital variations in intestinal stem cell niche architecture predispose to aberrant crypt development, creating microenvironments where gluten-reactive T cells preferentially expand and maintain pathogenic memory responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rationale**: Intestinal stem cell niches show individual variation in structure and cellular composition. Altered niche architecture could create specialized microenvironments that favor pathogenic T cell persistence and reactivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Therapeutic Implications**: Stem cell niche modulators or engineered probiotics that reshape crypt architecture could eliminate pathogenic T cell reservoirs, potentially providing long-term remission even with gluten exposure.\n",

      "**MeSH terms**: Celiac Disease/congenital, Intestinal Mucosa/embryology, Stem Cell Niche, T-Lymphocytes/pathology>\n",
      "\n",
      "<**Hypothesis**: Microbial production of tissue transglutaminase-modifying enzymes alters autoantigen structure and immunogenicity, with specific bacterial strains either promoting or protecting against celiac disease through post-translational modifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rationale**: Gut microbiota produce diverse enzymes that can modify host proteins. Bacterial enzymes could alter tissue transglutaminase structure, affecting its recognition by autoantibodies and T cells in celiac disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Therapeutic Implications**: Engineered probiotic bacteria expressing protective transglutaminase-modifying enzymes could reduce autoantigen immunogenicity, while targeting pathogenic bacterial enzymes could prevent disease-promoting modifications.\n",
