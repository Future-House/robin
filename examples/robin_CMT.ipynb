      "Step 1: Formulating relevant queries for literature search...\n",
      "Generated Queries:\n",
      "1. Search for studies employing high-throughput small-molecule libraries screened using nodal domain formation or paranodal junction assembly assays in peripheral demyelinating neuropathies, specifically evaluating compounds that restore axoglial integrity and molecular markers of nodal/paranodal architecture in cell and animal models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, with emphasis on target validation, mechanism confirmation, and preliminary pharmacokinetics/safety data\n",
      "2. Identify repurposed FDA-approved compounds or clinical-stage molecules that modulate expression, localization, or interaction of paranodal proteins (Caspr, Contactin-1, Neurofascin-155) in CMT patient-derived Schwann cell or dorsal root ganglion neuron coculture models, including data on dose–response, target engagement assays, and functional readouts of conduction velocity or nodal domain restoration\n",
      "3. Survey phenotypic screening campaigns focused on small molecules or biologics that enhance myelin–axon adhesion or paranodal septate junction assembly in rodent or iPSC-derived models of demyelinating neuropathy, prioritizing studies that report rescue of electrophysiological deficits, ultrastructural improvements, and ADME/toxicity profiles predictive of peripheral nerve exposure\n",
      "4. Query literature for mechanism-of-action studies of lead compounds identified in assays of nodal domain recovery—particularly inhibitors or activators of key signaling pathways (e.g., neuregulin-ErbB2/3, FAK/Src, RhoA/ROCK)—that demonstrate target engagement by biochemical or imaging methods in disease-relevant CMT models, including any translational PK/PD correlations\n",
      "5. Seek reports of small-molecule modulators of Schwann cell cytoskeletal regulators or membrane trafficking proteins (e.g., Fyn kinase, Annexin A2, endosomal recycling factors) that improve paranodal junction assembly and nerve conduction in in vivo CMT rodent models, with supporting safety and pharmacokinetic characterization\n",
      "6. Investigate genetic and functional studies delineating the role of paranodal cell adhesion molecules (Caspr1, Neurofascin-155, Contactin-1) in the formation and maintenance of nodal domains in peripheral nerves, with specific references to CMT mutations or animal knockout/knock-in models that phenocopy human disease pathophysiology\n",
      "7. Review the impact of common CMT-causing mutations (PMP22 duplication/triplication, MPZ, GJB1, MFN2) on Schwann cell–axon interactions, nodal/paranodal architecture, and conduction properties in both rodent models and patient-derived iPSC systems, including evidence for causative vs. secondary pathology\n",
      "8. Search ultrastructural and advanced imaging analyses (EM, super-resolution, live-cell) of nodal gap spacing, paranodal septate junction integrity, and axoglial contact sites in CMT patient nerve biopsies or experimental models, correlating structural defects with specific molecular disruptions\n",
      "9. Identify studies of intracellular signaling cascades that regulate Schwann cell adhesion and nodal domain stability—such as Rho GTPase cycles, FAK/Src pathways, and endocytic trafficking—where genetic manipulation or pharmacological inhibition/rescue experiments validate these pathways as therapeutic targets in CMT\n",
      "10. Compile evidence on mitochondrial dynamics, metabolic stress, and redox imbalance in Schwann cells and peripheral neurons as drivers of axoglial disjunction in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, focusing on target validation via genetic knockdown or small-molecule modulators that restore paranodal architecture and nerve function in preclinical models\n",
