"Avacincaptad pegol (Zimura; IVERIC bio), an RNA aptamer that selectively binds complement C5.","Proposal for Avacincaptad pegol (Zimura; IVERIC bio), an RNA aptamer that selectively binds complement C5.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Avacincaptad pegol (marketed as Zimura) is a synthetically produced RNA aptamer developed by IVERIC Bio that selectively binds to complement component C5. It is generated using advanced aptamer selection techniques such as SELEX, which identifies high‐affinity oligonucleotide sequences capable of binding specific protein targets, and incorporates chemical modifications such as PEGylation to enhance stability and ocular bioavailability (Avery et al., 2020; Kang, 2023). This therapeutic candidate belongs to the class of nucleic acid–based aptamers, which have been utilized over the past two decades as targeted therapeutics in various diseases, including oncology and ophthalmology, owing to their ability to bind proteins with high specificity and affinity, rivaling monoclonal antibodies but with the advantages of synthetic modifiability and potentially lower immunogenicity (Avery et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2023). Aptamers in general have been used for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition (e.g., Macugen®) in certain ocular conditions and they represent a promising emerging platform for targeted complement inhibition in retinal diseases.

Therapeutic History:
Avacincaptad pegol has been investigated primarily in the context of dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), specifically aimed at reducing geographic atrophy (GA), a late‐stage manifestation of dry AMD associated with progressive loss of photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and choriocapillaris. Clinical evidence from a series of Phase II/III trials – notably the GATHER1 (reported in publications such as Patel et al., 2023) and GATHER2 studies, as well as data from multiple ClinicalTrials.gov entries (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020) – has shown that monthly intravitreal injections of Avacincaptad pegol reduce the mean growth rate of GA lesions by approximately 27% compared to sham treatment (Avery et al., 2020; Khanani et al., 2023; Unknown Reference). These studies have validated both the pharmacokinetic profile — demonstrating sustained ocular levels following intravitreal dosing — and the clinical efficacy of complement inhibition in reducing GA progression, which had been an unmet need in dry AMD until recent approvals (Khanani et al., 2023; Unknown Reference). Although aptamers have been applied in other ocular indications (for example, Macugen targeted VEGF for neovascular AMD), Avacincaptad pegol is among the first in its class to be rigorously tested for the treatment of GA and stands out as a pioneering complement inhibitor to modulate inflammatory cascades in dry AMD (Bandello et al., 2017; Kassa et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of Avacincaptad pegol is centered on its ability to bind selectively to complement component C5 with high nanomolar affinity, thereby sequestering it in the vitreous and subretinal spaces after intravitreal administration (Cao et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2021). Once administered, Avacincaptad pegol binds C5 and prevents its enzymatic cleavage into the potent anaphylatoxin C5a and the structural component C5b, which initiates the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The prevention of C5 cleavage is of crucial therapeutic importance because C5a is a powerful chemoattractant and activator of inflammatory cells such as microglia and macrophages, while C5b is essential for MAC assembly that disrupts cell membranes and contributes to RPE cell injury (Qin et al., 2021; Hammadi et al., 2023). Histopathological studies have demonstrated that MAC deposition is present in drusen and along Bruch’s membrane in AMD patients, linking uncontrolled complement activation to RPE damage and GA progression (Bandello et al., 2017; Kassa et al., 2019). By inhibiting C5, Avacincaptad pegol aims to reduce complement-mediated inflammation and cytolysis, thus stabilizing the retinal environment and potentially slowing the enlargement of GA lesions (Khanani et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024). On a molecular level, the binding interaction likely involves the recognition of a specific epitope on C5 that is critical for its cleavage by convertases, effectively interrupting the downstream complement cascade while leaving upstream functions largely intact (Cao et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for using Avacincaptad pegol in dry AMD is that its intravitreal administration will result in localized sequestration of C5 in the subretinal space, thereby preventing its cleavage into the active fragments C5a and C5b. This blockade is expected to inhibit the formation of the MAC, as well as reduce C5a-mediated recruitment and activation of local microglia and macrophages (Qin et al., 2024; Kassa et al., 2019). As a consequence, the reduction in local inflammatory responses and complement-mediated cytolysis would lead to diminished deposition of complement factors in drusen and along Bruch’s membrane. Clinically, this is anticipated to slow the progression of GA lesion enlargement, as evidenced by Phase II/III clinical trial results that demonstrated an approximate 27% reduction in GA growth rate compared to sham over a one-year period (Khanani et al., 2023; Patel et al., 2023). Moreover, relevant studies have also suggested that complement activation products are elevated in the eyes of patients with AMD, and the C5 protein is expressed in the RPE and choriocapillaris where it participates in inflammatory signaling. Therefore, by specifically targeting and neutralizing C5, the therapy should mitigate key pathogenic drivers such as the activation of microglia, local cytokine release, and RPE cell loss, thereby preserving retinal structure and function (Hammadi et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024). The expected outcome in proposed assays measuring inflammatory markers, GA lesion area via fundus autofluorescence, and visual acuity would be a demonstrable deceleration of disease progression, translating into preservation of central vision over time (Khanani et al., 2023; Patel et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
The collective literature and clinical evidence support the potential of Avacincaptad pegol as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD, particularly in slowing the progression of geographic atrophy. One of its strongest advantages is the well-defined mechanism of action, where selective inhibition of complement C5 directly addresses the inflammatory and cytolytic pathways implicated in RPE damage. Multiple preclinical and clinical studies have validated that blocking C5 can lead to a significant reduction in GA lesion growth, as seen by the approximately 27% slowing in lesion progression in Phase II/III trials (Khanani et al., 2023; Patel et al., 2023). Additionally, the unique delivery of an RNA aptamer via intravitreal injection ensures that the drug is concentrated at the site of pathology, reducing systemic exposure and potentially limiting off-target effects (Cao et al., 2023; Fujii et al., 2025).

However, there are also important challenges and potential drawbacks. A notable safety concern identified during clinical trials is the increased incidence of macular neovascularization (MNV) or choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in treatment groups compared with sham controls; for instance, conversion rates to MNV were reported as high as 11.9% for the 2 mg dose and 15.7% for the 4 mg dose compared to approximately 2.7% in controls (Khanani et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2021). This adverse event may be attributed to complement inhibition altering the local angiogenic balance, and it necessitates comprehensive monitoring and potential adjunct therapies to manage neovascular complications. Moreover, as with most intravitreal therapies, the requirement for monthly injections imposes a significant treatment burden on patients, which could limit adherence and overall treatment satisfaction (Moreira, 2022; Patel et al., 2023). In terms of biochemical specificity, while Avacincaptad pegol has been optimized for high-affinity binding to C5, variability in patient response due to genetic heterogeneity in complement pathway components might influence the overall efficacy (Qin et al., 2024; Kassa et al., 2019).

Overall, Avacincaptad pegol exhibits a robust scientific rationale and has demonstrated promising clinical efficacy in reducing geographic atrophy progression in dry AMD. Its strengths lie in its specific, targeted mechanism of action against a well-validated pathological driver, favorable pharmacokinetic properties in the ocular compartment, and data-supported efficacy from pivotal trials. At the same time, the risk of neovascular complications and the logistic challenges associated with frequent intravitreal injections represent significant hurdles that must be carefully mitigated in ongoing and future studies. Consequently, from a drug development and validation perspective, Avacincaptad pegol stands out as a promising therapeutic candidate with a clearly defined pathway to regulatory approval, provided that safety concerns are rigorously managed and patient adherence is optimized (Khanani et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2024).

"Iptacopan (LNP023), a selective small-molecule inhibitor of complement factor B (Novartis; no special formulation required).","Proposal for Iptacopan (LNP023), a selective small-molecule inhibitor of complement factor B (Novartis; no special formulation required).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Iptacopan (LNP023) is a first‐in-class, orally administered, selective small-molecule inhibitor of complement factor B, a critical protease exclusively involved in the alternative pathway (AP) of the complement cascade. The compound was discovered through intensive medicinal chemistry efforts designed to achieve high potency and selectivity against factor B, with reported low-nanomolar inhibitory activity (IC50 ~1 nM) that has been confirmed across various in vitro assays (Kavanagh et al., 2025; Patel et al., 2022). As a fully synthetic molecule belonging to the class of small-molecule complement inhibitors, iptacopan is optimized for oral bioavailability and favorable ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) properties. Its synthesis involved structure-based drug design approaches to isolate chemical moieties that effectively block the binding of factor B to C3b and its subsequent proteolytic activation, ultimately preventing the assembly of the AP C3 convertase (C3bBb) (Kavanagh et al., 2025). This class of compounds has previously been employed in the treatment of complement-mediated disorders, and more recently factor B inhibitors have become attractive candidates for repurposing in ocular diseases due to their mechanism of action and their potential to modulate local complement activation while preserving systemic immunity (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Wilke & Apte, 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Iptacopan has established a robust therapeutic history in the realm of complement-mediated diseases, particularly within the field of renal disorders. It has been clinically evaluated in patients suffering from IgA nephropathy, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and C3 glomerulopathy. In these settings, iptacopan dose-dependently reduced biomarkers of complement activation such as Ba and C3 fragments in the blood while demonstrating a favorable safety profile, which is supported by several Phase II trials (Kavanagh et al., 2025; Latour et al., 2021). The use of iptacopan in these diseases underscores two important points: first, that blockade of the alternative pathway is clinically feasible and can lead to meaningful reductions in disease activity; and second, that systemic modulation of complement activity via an orally administered small molecule is a viable therapeutic strategy. Although iptacopan has not been formally applied in Phase III clinical trials for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to date, its extensive evaluation in other complement-mediated conditions provides a strong rationale for its repurposing in ocular diseases where similar mechanisms of complement dysregulation contribute to pathology (Patel et al., 2022; Wilke & Apte, 2024). Moreover, preclinical studies in murine models of retinal disease — including experiments in CFH-knockout and AP-overactivation models in the retina — have demonstrated that iptacopan decreases retinal C3b deposition and preserves the structural integrity of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor layers (Dreismann et al., 2023; Kavanagh et al., 2025). This promising overlap in therapeutic efficacy between renal and ocular disease models further strengthens the case for investigating iptacopan in dry AMD, a subtype of the disease characterized by complement dysregulation and progressive RPE degeneration (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, iptacopan exerts its therapeutic effect through highly selective inhibition of complement factor B, an essential enzyme in the amplification loop of the alternative complement pathway. Under normal conditions, complement factor B binds to C3b to form the proenzyme complex, which is subsequently cleaved by factor D into Ba and Bb. The released Bb fragment then associates stably with C3b to form the AP C3 convertase (C3bBb), which serves as a central amplification nexus by cleaving more C3 molecules into C3a and C3b (Kavanagh et al., 2025; Patel et al., 2022). Iptacopan binds specifically to the active site of factor B, thereby preventing its interaction with C3b. This disruption blocks the formation of the C3 convertase, leading to a reduction in the generation of downstream complement activation fragments such as C3a, iC3b, and C5a, as well as limiting the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) on target cells like the RPE (Kavanagh et al., 2025; Qin et al., 2021). Biochemically, the high-affinity binding of iptacopan to factor B ensures that even under conditions of robust complement activation, the alternative pathway remains effectively suppressed. Importantly, because iptacopan acts upstream of the generation of key inflammatory mediators, it has the potential to modulate not only the biochemical cascade but also the subsequent cellular inflammatory response, which is known to drive RPE dysfunction and chronic inflammation associated with drusen formation in dry AMD (Patel et al., 2022; Weber et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis driving the repurposing of iptacopan for dry AMD is based on the established role of complement dysregulation in the pathogenesis of the disease. In dry AMD, genetic studies have repeatedly implicated variants in complement regulatory genes such as CFH (for example, the Y402H polymorphism) and risk alleles in other components of the alternative pathway, including factor B, in predisposing individuals to drusen accumulation and subsequent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration (Weber et al., 2014; Wilke & Apte, 2024). By preventing the assembly of the alternative pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb) through blockade of factor B, iptacopan is expected to reduce the local generation of pro-inflammatory complement fragments. Consequently, this reduction should lead to diminished deposition of MAC on the RPE, thereby preventing complement-mediated cell injury and attenuating drusen biogenesis (Patel et al., 2022; Wilke & Apte, 2024). In preclinical models, particularly in murine systems engineered to exhibit complement overactivation in the retina, administration of iptacopan has been shown to lower retinal C3b deposition substantially and preserve the overall integrity of the photoreceptor and RPE layers (Dreismann et al., 2023; Kavanagh et al., 2025). Given that complement proteins, including factor B, are expressed in the subretinal space and are involved in the pathologic accumulation of drusen, effective inhibition of these proteins is anticipated to stabilize RPE viability and ultimately slow disease progression in dry AMD (Park et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2021). The oral route of administration further suggests that systemic drug levels can be maintained consistently to counteract chronic complement hyperactivation, offering a convenient alternative to intravitreal injections, which are currently under investigation for other complement inhibitors (Novartis Pharmaceuticals, 2022; Wilke & Apte, 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Iptacopan presents a compelling therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration based on its robust mechanistic rationale, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and clinically validated efficacy in other complement-mediated diseases. One of its key strengths is its highly selective inhibition of complement factor B, which is indispensable for the assembly of the alternative pathway C3 convertase. This selectivity ensures that iptacopan effectively attenuates the pathological amplification of complement activation while leaving the classical and lectin pathways—which are crucial for host defense—largely intact (Kavanagh et al., 2025; Patel et al., 2022). The compound’s low-nanomolar potency and oral bioavailability provide major advantages in terms of patient convenience and adherence, which are critical factors for a chronic condition like dry AMD that currently lacks effective treatment options (Latour et al., 2021; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, 2021a).

The therapeutic history of iptacopan in diseases such as IgA nephropathy, PNH, and C3 glomerulopathy adds strong translational credibility to its repurposing strategy. In these indications, iptacopan has demonstrated clear biochemical efficacy by reducing circulating markers of complement activation (e.g., Ba and C3 fragments) and has been generally well tolerated in clinical trials (Kavanagh et al., 2025; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, 2021b). While no direct clinical trial data exist yet for dry AMD, the mechanistic similarity between complement-mediated glomerulopathies and the inflammatory processes involved in dry AMD — including RPE cell damage and drusen formation — makes iptacopan a promising candidate for further investigation in this indication (Patel et al., 2022; Wilke & Apte, 2024).

Mechanistically, the ability of iptacopan to prevent the formation of the alternative pathway C3 convertase is of central importance. By binding to factor B, the drug halts the conversion of C3 to its active fragments, thereby reducing the generation of inflammatory mediators such as C3a and C5a, as well as limiting MAC deposition. This action is expected to protect the RPE from complement-driven injury, thereby mitigating one of the key pathways leading to RPE loss and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration seen in dry AMD (Kavanagh et al., 2025; Qin et al., 2021). Preclinical models have provided evidence of this effect, demonstrating that factor B inhibition reduces retinal complement deposition and preserves cell structure, which further supports the theoretical basis for its application in AMD (Dreismann et al., 2023; Park et al., 2021).

Nevertheless, certain challenges must be acknowledged. One potential concern with complement inhibition, in general, is the increased risk of infections, particularly with encapsulated bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis. While vaccination strategies and appropriate prophylactic measures can mitigate this risk, any long-term use of iptacopan in an elderly population, inherently at risk for infections, will need careful monitoring (Wilke & Apte, 2024; Kavanagh et al., 2025). Additionally, while systemic oral administration is an advantage for chronic disease management, it remains to be confirmed whether sufficient drug concentrations can be achieved in the subretinal space to affect local complement activation, given the blood-retinal barriers. However, early pharmacokinetic studies and preclinical work suggest that oral bioavailability combined with potent systemic complement inhibition may translate to meaningful local effects in the retina (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Patel et al., 2022).

Overall, the strengths of iptacopan include its clear mechanism of action targeting a well-validated component of the complement cascade, demonstrated efficacy in related complement-mediated diseases, low-nanomolar potency, and favorable oral dosing profile. The repurposing of iptacopan for dry AMD is supported by robust genetic and biochemical evidence linking alternative pathway dysregulation to drusen formation and RPE damage. The main weaknesses or uncertainties center on the translation of systemic pharmacokinetics to effective ocular tissue concentrations, and the potential risk of immunosuppression-related infections, both of which will need to be clarified in dedicated clinical studies targeting dry AMD (Patel et al., 2022; Wilke & Apte, 2024).

In conclusion, the repurposing of iptacopan (LNP023) for dry AMD is strongly justified based on a comprehensive review of the biochemical, genetic, and clinical data. Its mechanism—blocking factor B to prevent assembly of the alternative pathway C3 convertase—directly targets the pathological processes responsible for drusen biogenesis and RPE degeneration. The candidate benefits from advanced clinical-stage data in related complement-mediated diseases, promising oral bioavailability, and a targeted mode of action that preserves other aspects of the complement system, thereby minimizing systemic immunosuppression. Although challenges such as achieving effective ocular tissue levels and managing infection risk remain, the overall evaluation strongly supports further investigation of iptacopan in clinical trials focused on dry AMD. This candidate represents a promising new approach to address a significant unmet medical need in an aging population, and its continued development should be prioritized as part of a broader strategic initiative in complement-targeted therapies for ocular diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kavanagh et al., 2025; Wilke & Apte, 2024).

"Elamipretide (SS-31, MTP-131), a mitochondria-targeted tetrapeptide (Stealth BioTherapeutics).","Proposal for Elamipretide (SS-31, MTP-131), a mitochondria-targeted tetrapeptide (Stealth BioTherapeutics).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Elamipretide, also known as SS-31 or MTP-131, is a synthetic tetrapeptide originally developed by Stealth BioTherapeutics. It belongs to the class of mitochondria‐targeted peptides that are designed to selectively accumulate within the inner mitochondrial membrane. Its design exploits unique chemical properties such as an aromatic–cationic structure, enabling it to interact with the negatively charged mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin. The compound is fully synthetic and was discovered as part of efforts to generate molecules that can protect mitochondrial function in settings of oxidative stress and bioenergetic failure. This class of compounds has previously been used to combat mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and neurodegenerative diseases, and its potential has now been extended to ocular conditions such as dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Ji et al., 2021; Nashine, 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Elamipretide has been investigated in various preclinical models that simulate mitochondrial dysfunction across multiple tissues. In early biochemical studies, its ability to bind cardiolipin provided evidence for its action in stabilizing mitochondrial cristae and enhancing electron transport chain (ETC) efficiency. Preclinically, the compound has been shown to restore mitochondrial bioenergetics and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cellular models, including human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells exposed to oxidative stress. Numerous animal studies have corroborated these findings by demonstrating improved mitochondrial supercomplex formation and cellular viability under stress‐induced conditions (Nashine, 2021; Ji et al., 2021). Clinically, Elamipretide’s safety profile has been evaluated in several studies including a Phase I/II open-label trial in patients with geographic atrophy—a manifestation of dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Ji et al., 2021)—where its administration subcutaneously was well tolerated and associated with improvements in low-luminance visual acuity and slowed progression of atrophic lesions. Additionally, other clinical trials have examined Elamipretide in the context of mitochondrial myopathies and optic neuropathies, reinforcing its translational potential by repurposing a molecule with robust preclinical efficacy in mitochondrial preservation to ocular diseases that share similar pathomechanisms (Wubben et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
Elamipretide is designed to adhere specifically to cardiolipin, a phospholipid predominantly found on the inner mitochondrial membrane that is critical for maintaining cristae structure and optimal function of the ETC complexes. The binding of Elamipretide to cardiolipin stabilizes the inner mitochondrial membrane architecture, which in turn facilitates more efficient electron transport and ATP synthesis. Moreover, by preventing the peroxidation of cardiolipin, Elamipretide reduces the generation of mitochondrial ROS, a key factor in oxidative stress. This biochemical interaction not only preserves mitochondrial bioenergetics but also decreases the compromised signaling that would otherwise lead to activation of the complement cascade and inflammasome priming, both of which are implicated in driving RPE cell degeneration in AMD. Detailed studies have shown that under experimental stress conditions in RPE cells, Elamipretide restores mitochondrial membrane potential and elevates ATP production while substantially reducing levels of superoxide—mechanisms that are supported by evidence from both cellular models and animal studies (Ji et al., 2021; Nashine, 2021; Basei & Zorzano, 2023). Importantly, the stabilization of cardiolipin has downstream effects on autophagic flux, as improved mitochondrial quality control mechanisms then limit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, creating an environment that favors cell survival and limits drusen formation in the retina (Nashine, 2021; Plau, 2024).

Expected Effect:
The underlying hypothesis is that by selectively binding cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane of RPE cells, Elamipretide will stabilize mitochondrial cristae, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the electron transport chain and reducing the generation of ROS. Lower levels of ROS are expected to diminish the oxidative stress that drives complement activation and inflammasome priming in RPE cells. This sequence of events is anticipated to improve autophagic flux, resulting in a decrease in the inflammatory cytokine release that contributes to drusen formation and RPE degeneration. In practical terms, the treatment is expected to yield measurable improvements in mitochondrial function markers in RPE cells, thereby slowing or even partially reversing the degenerative changes associated with dry AMD. Clinical endpoints from early-phase studies already support this notion, as evidenced by improvements in low-luminance visual acuity and reductions in the progression rate of geographic atrophy in treated subjects (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Ji et al., 2021). Furthermore, the restoration of mitochondrial bioenergetics in RPE models as reported in vitro directly correlates with the potential for enhanced retinal function, given that RPE cells are critically dependent on mitochondrial ATP production. This mechanistic action is supported by biochemical analyses in which human RPE cultures treated with Elamipretide showed lowered mitochondrial superoxide production and improved lysosomal function, both of which are key in maintaining RPE health (Nashine, 2021; Ji et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Elamipretide holds considerable promise as a candidate for the treatment of dry AMD due to its targeted mechanism of action, which addresses a core pathogenic process in the disease—mitochondrial dysfunction. The strength of this therapeutic candidate lies in its well‐defined biochemical mechanism: by stabilizing cardiolipin and improving mitochondrial structure and function, it directly combats the oxidative stress and bioenergetic deficits that are known to contribute to RPE degeneration and drusen formation. Early clinical data, particularly from the Phase I/II ocular studies, indicate that the compound is safe, well tolerated, and has beneficial effects on visual function parameters in geographic atrophy (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Ji et al., 2021). In addition, the existing literature provides a strong preclinical rationale for its repurposing in dry AMD, with multiple studies highlighting its ability to restore mitochondrial dynamics, reduce ROS, and improve autophagic clearance, thus addressing both the trigger and the downstream consequences of oxidative stress (Nashine, 2021; Ji et al., 2021).

However, there are also challenges and weaknesses to consider. While the mechanistic data in vitro and in animal models are compelling, clinical efficacy in the context of dry AMD remains to be established through larger, controlled trials. Prior clinical studies in related indications, such as mitochondrial myopathies, have provided mixed outcomes when evaluating functional endpoints, suggesting that careful attention must be given to the translation of mitochondrial bioenergetic improvements into meaningful clinical benefits in vision (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024). Furthermore, as the compound is repurposed from treatment areas outside ophthalmology, issues such as optimal dosing, route of administration (subcutaneous versus topical), and long-term safety in the ocular context require additional rigorous investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019). In summary, despite these uncertainties, the well-supported biochemical rationale and early clinical safety signals position Elamipretide as a strong candidate for further development in dry AMD. Given the limited therapeutic options currently available for this disease, the unique mechanism of stabilizing mitochondrial cardiolipin offers a novel avenue that directly targets the underlying cellular dysfunction, making it a promising strategy to slow retinal degeneration and preserve vision (Guimaraes et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2021; Feng, 2021).

Overall, the accumulated evidence from biochemical studies, preclinical models, and early-phase clinical trials provides a robust rationale for advancing Elamipretide into later-stage clinical development for dry AMD. Its ability to enhance mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress, and potentially modulate pathological complement activation and inflammatory processes directly addresses key elements of dry AMD pathogenesis. The strengths of this approach include a clear and targetable mechanism—as evidenced by its binding to cardiolipin and consequent effects on mitochondrial integrity—as well as a favorable initial safety profile in existing clinical trials. Nonetheless, confirmation of efficacy in larger, well-controlled studies is essential before its widespread clinical adoption. Given the high unmet medical need in dry AMD and the promising translational data to date, further investment in clinical evaluation is warranted, with a focus on optimizing dosing regimens, refining the delivery method, and establishing long-term efficacy and safety endpoints (Nashine, 2021; Plau, 2024; Wubben et al., 2019).

"MCC950 (CRID3; Selleckchem catalog SML2236), a potent, selective small-molecule NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor.","Proposal for MCC950 (CRID3; Selleckchem catalog SML2236), a potent, selective small-molecule NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MCC950 (CRID3; Selleckchem catalog SML2236) is a synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor developed to target the NLRP3 inflammasome. It belongs to the diarylsulfonylurea class of compounds, which have been studied extensively for their anti‐inflammatory properties. The discovery of MCC950 arose from screening efforts aimed at identifying selective inhibitors capable of blocking inflammasome activation with high potency and specificity. Unlike many broad-spectrum anti‐inflammatory agents, MCC950 is engineered to bind specifically to the NACHT domain of the NLRP3 protein, which is critical for its ATP-dependent oligomerization and subsequent assembly of the inflammasome complex. This compound has been widely studied in a variety of inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease models, making it an attractive candidate for repurposing to treat chronic inflammatory conditions such as dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) where aberrant inflammasome activation plays a mechanistic role (Chauhan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, MCC950 has been evaluated extensively in preclinical models of inflammatory disorders, including autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases. Its potent inhibition of NLRP3 has been documented in models of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, colitis, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. In these studies, MCC950 has been shown to inhibit caspase-1 activation and reduce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, thereby diminishing downstream inflammatory cascades. Although clinical translation in some fields has encountered challenges, such as potential hepatotoxicity at high systemic doses, the compound’s pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles have been reasonably well characterized in rodent models (Chauhan et al., 2020; Kaur et al., 2025). More recently, in the context of ocular diseases, preclinical studies in retinal degeneration models have reported that using MCC950 in iPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells harboring complement factor H (CFH) risk alleles led to reduced caspase-1 cleavage, decreased IL-1β secretion, and diminished propidium-iodide uptake – markers indicative of reduced pyroptosis and improved cell survival. Additionally, murine models of geographic atrophy, a form of dry AMD, have shown that systemic administration of MCC950 lowers retinal IL-18 levels, preserves RPE morphology, and improves electroretinography (ERG) responses, suggesting potential efficacy in mitigating dry AMD pathology (Korhonen, 2024; Ortega et al., 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
MCC950 exerts its therapeutic effect by selectively binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 in a manner that inhibits its intrinsic ATPase activity, which is essential for the oligomerization and assembly of the inflammasome. This binding prevents the conformational changes required for NLRP3 to recruit the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and subsequently activate caspase-1. Caspase-1 is responsible for the proteolytic processing and maturation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. In essence, MCC950 disrupts the entire feed-forward amplification loop of inflammasome signaling that, under pathological conditions, can lead to chronic inflammation and cell death (pyroptosis) in RPE cells. The molecular interactions are focused on the ATP/dATP-binding pocket, and by blocking the hydrolysis of ATP, MCC950 locks NLRP3 in an inactive conformation. Moreover, MCC950 has been shown to prevent NLRP3-induced ASC oligomerization without affecting other inflammasome pathways, thus preserving the specificity of the immune response (Zhang et al., 2023; Chauhan et al., 2020). This molecular mechanism is supported by multiple in vitro studies demonstrating that in various cellular contexts, including human RPE cell lines and iPSC-derived RPE cells, selective NLRP3 inhibition leads to reduced caspase-1 activation and cytokine release, suggesting that this intervention can effectively blunt the inflammasome pathway downstream of complement dysregulation and oxidative stress—key features believed to drive dry AMD pathology (Korhonen, 2024; Wooff et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
The therapeutic hypothesis for using MCC950 in dry AMD is predicated on its ability to antagonize the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in retinal pigment epithelial cells. In the diseased retina, chronic oxidative stress and complement dysregulation (with elevated levels of complement fragments such as C3a and C5a) prime and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. The consequent cascade leads to caspase-1-dependent processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, which in turn contribute to a vicious cycle of inflammation, RPE cell pyroptosis, and compromised barrier integrity. By binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, MCC950 is expected to interrupt this feed-forward loop. The anticipated outcomes in experimental assays include a measurable reduction in caspase-1 cleavage, decreased secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, and a substantial reduction in markers of pyroptotic cell death (e.g., reduced propidium-iodide uptake). This preservation of RPE cell viability should theoretically maintain the integrity of the outer blood-retina barrier and prevent progressive degeneration of the macula. With respect to retinal function, improved electrophysiological responses (as measured by ERG) are expected in preclinical animal models, correlating with a stabilization or improvement in visual function. The expression of NLRP3 and the downstream cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 have been noted in RPE cells under degenerative conditions, providing a strong molecular rationale for the intervention. Preclinical studies indicate that in models of AMD, particularly in RPE cells derived from patients with CFH risk alleles, MCC950 reduces inflammatory signaling and cell death, thereby supporting its expected beneficial effect (Korhonen, 2024; Ortega et al., 2024; Wooff et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of MCC950 as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is promising, yet warrants cautious optimism given the complexity of inflammasome biology in retinal degeneration. Among the strengths of MCC950 are its high potency and selectivity for NLRP3, a target that has been robustly implicated in the pathogenesis of dry AMD. Its mechanism of action is well defined at the molecular level, and its ability to specifically block the ATP-dependent activation of NLRP3 offers a precise means of attenuating the downstream inflammatory cascade that contributes to RPE degeneration. Preclinical data, particularly from studies in iPSC-derived RPE with high-risk CFH alleles and murine geographic atrophy models, provide compelling evidence that MCC950 may reduce inflammatory cytokine release, preserve RPE morphology, and improve functional outcomes such as ERG responses. Additionally, MCC950’s established rodent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, as well as its defined therapeutic window, support its translational potential (Korhonen, 2024; Ortega et al., 2024; Wooff et al., 2020).

However, there are notable weaknesses and challenges that must be addressed. First, while the inhibition of NLRP3 in RPE cells appears beneficial in preclinical models, the complex role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in ocular immunity means that its systemic inhibition might have unintended consequences in terms of broad immunosuppression or disruption of homeostatic inflammatory responses. Moreover, some literature suggests that complete inhibition of the NLRP3 pathway—particularly in contexts where IL-18 might have a protective role—could have paradoxical effects (Doyle et al., 2012). Additionally, the delivery of MCC950 specifically to the retina poses formulation challenges; while systemic administration has been shown to lower retinal IL-18 levels in animal models, achieving sufficient local concentrations in the human eye without off-target effects remains an important hurdle. There is also the concern of potential hepatotoxicity documented in some studies involving high doses of diarylsulfonylurea compounds, which necessitates a careful evaluation of dosing regimens in ocular applications that might differ from systemic uses in other inflammatory diseases (Kaur et al., 2025; Lim et al., 2020).

Furthermore, while the preclinical efficacy of MCC950 appears robust in models of retinal inflammation and degeneration, the translational step to clinical efficacy in dry AMD remains to be firmly established. There are currently no clinical trials directly testing MCC950 in macular degeneration as indicated by recent searches (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), which highlights the early stage of its development for ocular indications. The balance between inhibiting pathogenic inflammasome activation and preserving beneficial immune responses is delicate, and additional studies are needed to ascertain the long-term safety and efficacy of MCC950 in the context of chronic ocular diseases.

In conclusion, MCC950 represents a compelling therapeutic candidate for dry AMD due to its targeted inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a pathway that is mechanistically linked to RPE cell degeneration through complement dysregulation, oxidative stress, and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine release. The strengths of its high selectivity, well-defined molecular mechanism, and promising preclinical efficacy in AMD-relevant models support further investigation and development. Nonetheless, potential challenges related to precise ocular delivery, unwanted immunosuppressive effects, and safety concerns such as hepatotoxicity must be carefully addressed in subsequent preclinical and clinical studies. The gathered evidence suggests that with appropriate formulation and dosing strategies, MCC950 could fill a currently unmet need in the treatment of dry AMD by preventing inflammasome-mediated RPE loss and preserving visual function (Korhonen, 2024; Ortega et al., 2024; Wooff et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2023).

"SMER28 (Small-Molecule Enhancer of Rapamycin 28; Tocris catalog 4873), a beclin-1–dependent autophagy inducer.

Below is a detailed evaluation of SMER28 as a therapeutic candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (dry AMD):","Proposal for SMER28 (Small-Molecule Enhancer of Rapamycin 28; Tocris catalog 4873), a beclin-1–dependent autophagy inducer.

Below is a detailed evaluation of SMER28 as a therapeutic candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (dry AMD):

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SMER28 (Small‐Molecule Enhancer of Rapamycin 28; Tocris catalog 4873) is a chemically synthesized small molecule that was originally discovered through high‐throughput screening campaigns designed to identify novel modulators of autophagic flux. Unlike classical mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin, SMER28 was identified for its ability to enhance autophagy in a manner independent of direct mTOR inhibition. Early screening efforts focused on compounds capable of amplifying the cellular autophagic machinery, aiming to overcome the off‐target effects commonly associated with pan‐mTOR suppression. SMER28 belongs to a broader class of compounds known as Small Molecule Enhancers of Rapamycin (SMERs), a group which has been used primarily as experimental tools to dissect autophagy pathways in various cell models, including neurodegenerative disease paradigms. The chemical structure of SMER28 is based on heterocyclic scaffolds, with modifications (often incorporating quinazoline derivatives) that favor cell permeability and bioactivity, which are designed and optimized through standard organic synthesis methods – these methods involve multi‐step reactions using reagents that are typical in kinase modulator chemistry. Its discovery and subsequent chemical optimization have provided a structure–activity relationship (SAR) that underscores its potential for repurposing, as its ability to enhance autophagic flux has been well‐documented in biochemical assays (Koukourakis et al., 2018; Nekova et al., 2014). Moreover, this class of compounds initially emerged from studies aimed at overcoming the limitations of mTOR‐dependent autophagy inducers, making SMER28 a compelling candidate for diseases in which improved targeted clearance of intracellular debris is central to therapeutic efficacy.

Therapeutic History:
SMER28 has been extensively studied in preclinical settings outside the realm of ophthalmology. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that SMER28 is capable of driving the conversion of the autophagy marker LC3 from its cytosolic form (LC3-I) to the lipidated autophagosome-associated form (LC3-II). These studies have been carried out in multiple cell lines, suggesting that the compound effectively reduces the accumulation of p62 aggregates, a hallmark of impaired autophagic flux. In cellular models of neurodegeneration, particularly in experiments using dopaminergic cells exposed to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), SMER28 provided significant neuroprotection by attenuating cytotoxicity, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and preserving mitochondrial integrity (Darabi et al., 2019). This neuroprotective effect supports the idea that SMER28 could bolster autophagic clearance pathways, offering a mechanism by which cells can rid themselves of aggregated or oxidatively damaged proteins. In addition to its neuroprotective applications, SMER28 has also been explored in antiviral research. For instance, in studies investigating human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication, SMER28 was shown to inhibit viral replication through its capacity to modulate autophagy independent of mTOR inhibition, suggesting that its mechanism might be beneficial in pathological contexts involving aberrant intracellular clearance (Clark et al., 2018). Furthermore, investigations targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis have revealed that SMER28 directly inhibits the p110δ isoform of class I PI3K – an activity that has been exploited in models testing anti-proliferative and anticancer effects (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a). Although these studies have primarily focused on neurodegeneration, oncology, and antiviral contexts, an examination of data from clinical trial databases reveals that there is growing interest in repurposing autophagy enhancers, including SMER28, for retinal degenerative diseases such as dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Vessey et al., 2022). Despite no clinical trial having yet confirmed its efficacy in dry AMD specifically, the robust preclinical profile across diverse indications provides a strong rationale for development in this indication.

Mechanism of Action:
SMER28 operates through a multifaceted and complex mechanism that ultimately converges on the stimulation of autophagy. At the heart of its activity is the upregulation of beclin-1–dependent autophagic pathways. Beclin-1 is a critical protein in the initiation of autophagosome formation; it forms a core component of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex which catalyzes the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), a lipid pivotal for nucleating the autophagic membrane. SMER28 treatment has been associated with an increased conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in several cell models, which is further supported by a reduction in p62 levels, indicating a boost in autophagic clearance capacity (Darabi et al., 2019; Kirchenwitz et al., 2022b). Importantly, unlike rapamycin, which activates autophagy by directly inhibiting mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), SMER28 does not rely on mTOR inhibition. Instead, it has been shown to modulate autophagy through alternative pathways: one aspect involves direct inhibition of the class I PI3K catalytic subunit p110δ. Inhibition of this kinase facilitates a decrease in the phosphorylation of Akt at threonine 308 and serine 473, relieving inhibitory signals on autophagy and thereby skewing cellular homeostasis towards an autophagic state (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a). This selective inhibition not only promotes autophagy but also impairs receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated signaling pathways that otherwise drive cell growth and inflammation.

Additionally, SMER28 has been reported to engage the activity of valosin-containing protein (VCP), a key regulator of protein homeostasis that is involved in both autophagic and proteasomal degradation pathways. SMER28 appears to bind directly to VCP and stimulates its D1 ATPase activity. This activation has two important consequences. First, it facilitates the assembly and activation of the PI3K complex that includes VPS34, ATG14L, and beclin-1, thereby enhancing the production of PI(3)P necessary for autophagy initiation (Wrobel et al., 2022). Second, the stimulation of VCP activity enhances the proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, which is an important adjunct to autophagic clearance in maintaining overall protein quality control. In some experimental systems, SMER28 has also been associated with modulation of microtubule dynamics, leading to increased tubulin acetylation and stabilization of the cytoskeletal network. These effects on the microtubule system may further facilitate autophagosomal transport and fusion with lysosomes, enhancing the overall efficiency of the degradation process (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022b). The critical requirement of beclin-1 for SMER28’s effect has been validated in studies where loss of beclin-1 function abrogated the increases in LC3-II expression and autophagosome formation seen with SMER28 treatment (Wrobel et al., 2022). Overall, SMER28’s mechanism is distinct because it simultaneously inhibits pro-survival and proliferation signals through PI3K p110δ inhibition and promotes autophagic clearance through both beclin-1–dependent autophagy initiation and VCP-mediated proteostatic mechanisms (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a; Koukourakis et al., 2018).

Expected Effect:
The working hypothesis for utilizing SMER28 in the context of dry AMD is rooted in the role that impaired autophagy and lysosomal dysfunction play in the pathology of the disease. Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, which are critically involved in supporting photoreceptor health and overall retinal homeostasis, tend to accumulate toxic deposits such as drusen—a composite of oxidized lipids, lipofuscin, and other cellular debris—as a result of deteriorating autophagic capacity. These deposits can trigger inflammatory cascades, including activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and complement system, leading to progressive RPE degeneration and vision loss. It is expected that by activating beclin-1–dependent autophagy, SMER28 will enhance the clearance of these drusen constituents. In doing so, it should restore lysosomal integrity and reduce secondary inflammatory signals (Kaarniranta et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2015).

In vitro, SMER28 has already been shown to increase the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, indicative of robust autophagic flux; it simultaneously reduces p62 levels, thereby clearing toxic protein aggregates and damaged organelles. These molecular markers are crucial because, in RPE cells, efficient autophagy is essential not only for removing debris but also for maintaining mitochondrial function and limiting oxidative stress. Analogous studies in neurodegenerative models have shown that enhanced autophagic activity correlates with improved clearance of misfolded proteins and damaged mitochondria, which is directly translatable to the dysfunctional processes observed in dry AMD (Darabi et al., 2019).

Moreover, given that SMER28 has been observed to inhibit PI3K p110δ, it is anticipated that such modulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway may reduce abnormal pro-survival signals that, in the context of stress, can exacerbate inflammation. Inhibiting these signals in a controlled fashion may further help limit the overactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a process implicated in the inflammatory pathology of dry AMD (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a). Furthermore, the activation of VCP by SMER28 is expected to bolster protein quality control mechanisms by enhancing the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This dual action—improved clearance of toxic aggregates via autophagy and proteasomal pathways—can potentially stabilize RPE cell function under conditions of chronic oxidative stress and metabolic challenge.

The RPE cells have been shown in other studies to express high levels of beclin-1 and autophagy-related markers under stress conditions, and the restoration of autophagic function in these cells could lead to a decrease in drusen formation and an overall improvement in retinal homeostasis. Although direct experimental data in RPE cell models for SMER28 are limited, the effects seen in other cell systems suggest that under oxidative stress conditions, similar improvements in mitochondrial quality control, reduced accumulation of debris, and decreased inflammatory cytokine production may be achievable. Additionally, preclinical data in murine retinal models have demonstrated that autophagy enhancers can reduce lipofuscin-like deposits and preserve RPE morphology, implying that SMER28 might exert similar beneficial effects if applied to such models (Vessey et al., 2022).

It is also anticipated that by promoting autophagic flux, SMER28 will help clear potentially cytotoxic aggregates that not only trigger inflammation but also impair lysosomal enzyme function—a critical component in RPE cell survival. The combined effects—targeting drusen clearance, limiting inflammasome activation, and improving mitochondrial integrity—are expected to ultimately preserve the structural and functional integrity of the RPE, which is essential for maintaining vision in dry AMD patients (Gunawan et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2015).

Overall Evaluation:
An extensive literature review based on the available data indicates that SMER28 is a strong candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD. One of the primary strengths of SMER28 is its uniquely multifactorial mechanism of action; it acts to stimulate autophagic flux in a manner that is dependent on beclin-1, while simultaneously inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway through selective inhibition of the p110δ subunit, and activating VCP to promote both autophagy and proteasomal clearance. This combination of mechanistic actions directly addresses several of the key pathophysiological processes in dry AMD—namely, the accumulation of drusen constituents composed of oxidized lipids, lipofuscin, and other cellular debris, along with the secondary inflammatory cascades mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation and complement deposition (Darabi et al., 2019; Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a; Wrobel et al., 2022). The mTOR-independent nature of SMER28 is particularly noteworthy because it offers the possibility of inducing autophagy without the systemic side effects associated with mTOR inhibition, such as immunosuppression and metabolic disturbance. This is an important consideration given that chronic conditions like dry AMD require treatments with minimal long-term adverse effects (Koukourakis et al., 2018; Kirchenwitz et al., 2022b).

Furthermore, the preclinical evidence supporting the efficacy of SMER28 in other cellular models—ranging from neurodegeneration, where mitochondrial quality control and protein aggregate clearance are vital, to studies in antiviral contexts—suggests that the underlying cellular mechanisms governing autophagic flux are sufficiently conserved such that benefits seen elsewhere could translate to the RPE. In neurodegenerative cell models, for example, SMER28 reduced toxic protein aggregates and restored mitochondrial function; both of these outcomes are desirable in the treatment of dry AMD, where similar cellular stresses occur. The observation that SMER28 can induce G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibit growth factor-dependent pathways further supports its potential to modulate inflammatory and proliferative signals that contribute to disease pathology (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a).

Nevertheless, several weaknesses and gaps in the current research must be acknowledged before SMER28 can be advanced confidently for dry AMD. For one, direct evidence of its efficacy in RPE cells or in animal models specifically engineered to mimic dry AMD pathology remains sparse. Although biochemical markers of autophagy improvement (increased LC3-II, decreased p62) have been robustly documented in other systems, the unique physiology of RPE cells—with their high metabolic demand, chronic oxidative stress, and complex intracellular trafficking requirements—necessitates specific validation. Studies in RPE cells would need to confirm that SMER28 can indeed clear drusen constituents, reduce lysosomal destabilization, and mitigate inflammatory signaling driven by the NLRP3 inflammasome and complement activation (Gunawan et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2015).

Another consideration is the potential for off-target effects arising from SMER28’s inhibition of the PI3K p110δ isoform. Although selective inhibition of p110δ is attractive in some contexts, PI3K is expressed ubiquitously and plays essential roles in many cellular processes including cell survival, metabolism, and immune responses. Thus, systemic exposure to SMER28 could, in theory, lead to unintended effects in tissues outside the retina if proper pharmacokinetic and delivery strategies are not established. Such concerns might be mitigated by exploring localized delivery approaches (for example, intravitreal injections or advanced nanoparticle formulations), which could limit systemic exposure while maximizing retinal bioavailability (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a; Park & Lee, 2022).

The mechanism of action of SMER28 also places considerable reliance on the proper functioning of beclin-1. In advanced stages of AMD, it is possible that beclin-1 expression or function may be compromised, which could limit the efficacy of any therapeutic reliant on this pathway. Consequently, it will be important to assess beclin-1 levels in diseased RPE cells and to determine whether SMER28 can overcome any intrinsic deficiencies in the autophagy machinery. Such studies will be critical for informing patient selection and stratifying potential responders in future clinical trials (Ochoa et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2015).

Additional challenges include the detailed characterization of ocular pharmacokinetics and long-term safety profiles of SMER28 in the context of the retinal microenvironment. Although its small-molecule nature and defined SAR profile are promising for further medicinal chemistry optimization, the complex architecture of the eye—which includes barriers such as the blood-retina barrier—means that extensive studies will be required to ensure adequate penetration, sustained therapeutic levels in the RPE, and minimal toxicity upon chronic administration. The possibility of off-target kinase inhibition, even if minimal according to some kinase profiling studies, must be rigorously assessed in both in vitro and in vivo retinal models before clinical development is pursued (Wrobel et al., 2022; Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a).

In summary, SMER28 presents a highly intriguing and mechanistically sophisticated candidate for development as a treatment for dry AMD. Its ability to induce autophagy independently of mTOR inhibition, coupled with direct inhibition of critical signaling nodes such as PI3K p110δ and activation of VCP-mediated proteostatic mechanisms, directly addresses the pathological features of dry AMD, including impaired clearance of drusen constituents, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation. The preclinical evidence gathered from models of neurodegeneration, viral replication, and basic autophagy research provides a strong rationale for repurposing SMER28 in the retinal context (Darabi et al., 2019; Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a; Wrobel et al., 2022).

However, before SMER28 can be translated into the clinic for dry AMD, several key areas require further investigation. First, direct studies in RPE cell models must confirm that the compound induces robust autophagic clearance of drusen-related materials and improves RPE cell viability. Second, appropriate animal models that mimic human dry AMD should be utilized to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of SMER28, particularly with respect to reversing or halting the progression of RPE degeneration. Third, detailed pharmacokinetic studies are needed to ascertain the best methods for delivering SMER28 to the retina, whether via topical, intravitreal, or other localized routes, to limit systemic exposure and potential off-target effects. Fourth, because SMER28 operates via beclin-1–dependent autophagy, it will be essential to characterize the status of beclin-1 and other autophagy-related proteins in the RPE of AMD patients, which may influence therapeutic outcomes. Finally, long-term toxicity studies must be undertaken to ensure that chronic modulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and VCP activity does not adversely affect retinal function or elicit unintended systemic consequences (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Vessey et al., 2022).

In conclusion, SMER28 exhibits several compelling attributes as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its multifaceted mode of autophagy enhancement—through beclin-1 upregulation, PI3K p110δ inhibition, and VCP activation—aligns well with the need to restore efficient cellular clearance mechanisms in the RPE, thereby addressing the underlying pathogenesis of drusen accumulation and chronic inflammation. The mTOR-independent nature of SMER28 further reduces the potential for adverse effects associated with systemic mTOR inhibition, which could be particularly beneficial over the long-term treatment courses necessary in chronic degenerative diseases such as dry AMD. While the preclinical data from diverse disease models are encouraging, direct evidence in the context of retinal physiology is currently insufficient and represents the most significant gap in the literature. Addressing this gap through dedicated studies in RPE-specific in vitro models and relevant animal models will be critical to validate whether the hypothesized benefits regarding drusen clearance and preservation of RPE health can be realized in vivo. If these challenges can be met with rigorous experimental design and careful optimization of drug delivery parameters, SMER28 may indeed offer a novel and much-needed treatment option for patients suffering from dry AMD—a condition for which there remains a significant unmet clinical need (Zhang et al., 2015; Gunawan et al., 2021).

Overall, the combined strengths of SMER28—its well-defined mechanism, its capacity to enhance autophagic flux independently of mTOR, and its potential to modulate multiple pathways involved in proteostasis and inflammatory signaling—make it a promising candidate worthy of further investigation for dry AMD. The weaknesses, particularly the lack of direct RPE-centric data and potential off-target effects inherent in systemic PI3K inhibition, must be addressed with carefully designed preclinical experiments. Should these hurdles be overcome, SMER28 could transition from being an effective research tool to a therapeutic asset for restoring retinal function and slowing the progression of dry AMD, thereby significantly improving patient outcomes in a disease area with very limited treatment options (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a; Wrobel et al., 2022; Darabi et al., 2019).
