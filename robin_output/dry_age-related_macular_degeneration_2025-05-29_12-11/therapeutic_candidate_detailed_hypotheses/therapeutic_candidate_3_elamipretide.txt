Proposal for Elamipretide (SS-31, MTP-131), a mitochondria-targeted tetrapeptide (Stealth BioTherapeutics).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Elamipretide, also known as SS-31 or MTP-131, is a synthetic tetrapeptide originally developed by Stealth BioTherapeutics. It belongs to the class of mitochondria‐targeted peptides that are designed to selectively accumulate within the inner mitochondrial membrane. Its design exploits unique chemical properties such as an aromatic–cationic structure, enabling it to interact with the negatively charged mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin. The compound is fully synthetic and was discovered as part of efforts to generate molecules that can protect mitochondrial function in settings of oxidative stress and bioenergetic failure. This class of compounds has previously been used to combat mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and neurodegenerative diseases, and its potential has now been extended to ocular conditions such as dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Ji et al., 2021; Nashine, 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Elamipretide has been investigated in various preclinical models that simulate mitochondrial dysfunction across multiple tissues. In early biochemical studies, its ability to bind cardiolipin provided evidence for its action in stabilizing mitochondrial cristae and enhancing electron transport chain (ETC) efficiency. Preclinically, the compound has been shown to restore mitochondrial bioenergetics and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cellular models, including human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells exposed to oxidative stress. Numerous animal studies have corroborated these findings by demonstrating improved mitochondrial supercomplex formation and cellular viability under stress‐induced conditions (Nashine, 2021; Ji et al., 2021). Clinically, Elamipretide’s safety profile has been evaluated in several studies including a Phase I/II open-label trial in patients with geographic atrophy—a manifestation of dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Ji et al., 2021)—where its administration subcutaneously was well tolerated and associated with improvements in low-luminance visual acuity and slowed progression of atrophic lesions. Additionally, other clinical trials have examined Elamipretide in the context of mitochondrial myopathies and optic neuropathies, reinforcing its translational potential by repurposing a molecule with robust preclinical efficacy in mitochondrial preservation to ocular diseases that share similar pathomechanisms (Wubben et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
Elamipretide is designed to adhere specifically to cardiolipin, a phospholipid predominantly found on the inner mitochondrial membrane that is critical for maintaining cristae structure and optimal function of the ETC complexes. The binding of Elamipretide to cardiolipin stabilizes the inner mitochondrial membrane architecture, which in turn facilitates more efficient electron transport and ATP synthesis. Moreover, by preventing the peroxidation of cardiolipin, Elamipretide reduces the generation of mitochondrial ROS, a key factor in oxidative stress. This biochemical interaction not only preserves mitochondrial bioenergetics but also decreases the compromised signaling that would otherwise lead to activation of the complement cascade and inflammasome priming, both of which are implicated in driving RPE cell degeneration in AMD. Detailed studies have shown that under experimental stress conditions in RPE cells, Elamipretide restores mitochondrial membrane potential and elevates ATP production while substantially reducing levels of superoxide—mechanisms that are supported by evidence from both cellular models and animal studies (Ji et al., 2021; Nashine, 2021; Basei & Zorzano, 2023). Importantly, the stabilization of cardiolipin has downstream effects on autophagic flux, as improved mitochondrial quality control mechanisms then limit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, creating an environment that favors cell survival and limits drusen formation in the retina (Nashine, 2021; Plau, 2024).

Expected Effect:
The underlying hypothesis is that by selectively binding cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane of RPE cells, Elamipretide will stabilize mitochondrial cristae, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the electron transport chain and reducing the generation of ROS. Lower levels of ROS are expected to diminish the oxidative stress that drives complement activation and inflammasome priming in RPE cells. This sequence of events is anticipated to improve autophagic flux, resulting in a decrease in the inflammatory cytokine release that contributes to drusen formation and RPE degeneration. In practical terms, the treatment is expected to yield measurable improvements in mitochondrial function markers in RPE cells, thereby slowing or even partially reversing the degenerative changes associated with dry AMD. Clinical endpoints from early-phase studies already support this notion, as evidenced by improvements in low-luminance visual acuity and reductions in the progression rate of geographic atrophy in treated subjects (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Ji et al., 2021). Furthermore, the restoration of mitochondrial bioenergetics in RPE models as reported in vitro directly correlates with the potential for enhanced retinal function, given that RPE cells are critically dependent on mitochondrial ATP production. This mechanistic action is supported by biochemical analyses in which human RPE cultures treated with Elamipretide showed lowered mitochondrial superoxide production and improved lysosomal function, both of which are key in maintaining RPE health (Nashine, 2021; Ji et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Elamipretide holds considerable promise as a candidate for the treatment of dry AMD due to its targeted mechanism of action, which addresses a core pathogenic process in the disease—mitochondrial dysfunction. The strength of this therapeutic candidate lies in its well‐defined biochemical mechanism: by stabilizing cardiolipin and improving mitochondrial structure and function, it directly combats the oxidative stress and bioenergetic deficits that are known to contribute to RPE degeneration and drusen formation. Early clinical data, particularly from the Phase I/II ocular studies, indicate that the compound is safe, well tolerated, and has beneficial effects on visual function parameters in geographic atrophy (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Ji et al., 2021). In addition, the existing literature provides a strong preclinical rationale for its repurposing in dry AMD, with multiple studies highlighting its ability to restore mitochondrial dynamics, reduce ROS, and improve autophagic clearance, thus addressing both the trigger and the downstream consequences of oxidative stress (Nashine, 2021; Ji et al., 2021).

However, there are also challenges and weaknesses to consider. While the mechanistic data in vitro and in animal models are compelling, clinical efficacy in the context of dry AMD remains to be established through larger, controlled trials. Prior clinical studies in related indications, such as mitochondrial myopathies, have provided mixed outcomes when evaluating functional endpoints, suggesting that careful attention must be given to the translation of mitochondrial bioenergetic improvements into meaningful clinical benefits in vision (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024). Furthermore, as the compound is repurposed from treatment areas outside ophthalmology, issues such as optimal dosing, route of administration (subcutaneous versus topical), and long-term safety in the ocular context require additional rigorous investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2019). In summary, despite these uncertainties, the well-supported biochemical rationale and early clinical safety signals position Elamipretide as a strong candidate for further development in dry AMD. Given the limited therapeutic options currently available for this disease, the unique mechanism of stabilizing mitochondrial cardiolipin offers a novel avenue that directly targets the underlying cellular dysfunction, making it a promising strategy to slow retinal degeneration and preserve vision (Guimaraes et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2021; Feng, 2021).

Overall, the accumulated evidence from biochemical studies, preclinical models, and early-phase clinical trials provides a robust rationale for advancing Elamipretide into later-stage clinical development for dry AMD. Its ability to enhance mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress, and potentially modulate pathological complement activation and inflammatory processes directly addresses key elements of dry AMD pathogenesis. The strengths of this approach include a clear and targetable mechanism—as evidenced by its binding to cardiolipin and consequent effects on mitochondrial integrity—as well as a favorable initial safety profile in existing clinical trials. Nonetheless, confirmation of efficacy in larger, well-controlled studies is essential before its widespread clinical adoption. Given the high unmet medical need in dry AMD and the promising translational data to date, further investment in clinical evaluation is warranted, with a focus on optimizing dosing regimens, refining the delivery method, and establishing long-term efficacy and safety endpoints (Nashine, 2021; Plau, 2024; Wubben et al., 2019).
