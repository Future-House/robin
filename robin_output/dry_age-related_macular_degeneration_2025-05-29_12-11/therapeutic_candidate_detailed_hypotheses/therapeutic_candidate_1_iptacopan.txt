Proposal for Iptacopan (LNP023), a selective small-molecule inhibitor of complement factor B (Novartis; no special formulation required).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Iptacopan (LNP023) is a first‐in-class, orally administered, selective small-molecule inhibitor of complement factor B, a critical protease exclusively involved in the alternative pathway (AP) of the complement cascade. The compound was discovered through intensive medicinal chemistry efforts designed to achieve high potency and selectivity against factor B, with reported low-nanomolar inhibitory activity (IC50 ~1 nM) that has been confirmed across various in vitro assays (Kavanagh et al., 2025; Patel et al., 2022). As a fully synthetic molecule belonging to the class of small-molecule complement inhibitors, iptacopan is optimized for oral bioavailability and favorable ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) properties. Its synthesis involved structure-based drug design approaches to isolate chemical moieties that effectively block the binding of factor B to C3b and its subsequent proteolytic activation, ultimately preventing the assembly of the AP C3 convertase (C3bBb) (Kavanagh et al., 2025). This class of compounds has previously been employed in the treatment of complement-mediated disorders, and more recently factor B inhibitors have become attractive candidates for repurposing in ocular diseases due to their mechanism of action and their potential to modulate local complement activation while preserving systemic immunity (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Wilke & Apte, 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Iptacopan has established a robust therapeutic history in the realm of complement-mediated diseases, particularly within the field of renal disorders. It has been clinically evaluated in patients suffering from IgA nephropathy, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and C3 glomerulopathy. In these settings, iptacopan dose-dependently reduced biomarkers of complement activation such as Ba and C3 fragments in the blood while demonstrating a favorable safety profile, which is supported by several Phase II trials (Kavanagh et al., 2025; Latour et al., 2021). The use of iptacopan in these diseases underscores two important points: first, that blockade of the alternative pathway is clinically feasible and can lead to meaningful reductions in disease activity; and second, that systemic modulation of complement activity via an orally administered small molecule is a viable therapeutic strategy. Although iptacopan has not been formally applied in Phase III clinical trials for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to date, its extensive evaluation in other complement-mediated conditions provides a strong rationale for its repurposing in ocular diseases where similar mechanisms of complement dysregulation contribute to pathology (Patel et al., 2022; Wilke & Apte, 2024). Moreover, preclinical studies in murine models of retinal disease — including experiments in CFH-knockout and AP-overactivation models in the retina — have demonstrated that iptacopan decreases retinal C3b deposition and preserves the structural integrity of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor layers (Dreismann et al., 2023; Kavanagh et al., 2025). This promising overlap in therapeutic efficacy between renal and ocular disease models further strengthens the case for investigating iptacopan in dry AMD, a subtype of the disease characterized by complement dysregulation and progressive RPE degeneration (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, iptacopan exerts its therapeutic effect through highly selective inhibition of complement factor B, an essential enzyme in the amplification loop of the alternative complement pathway. Under normal conditions, complement factor B binds to C3b to form the proenzyme complex, which is subsequently cleaved by factor D into Ba and Bb. The released Bb fragment then associates stably with C3b to form the AP C3 convertase (C3bBb), which serves as a central amplification nexus by cleaving more C3 molecules into C3a and C3b (Kavanagh et al., 2025; Patel et al., 2022). Iptacopan binds specifically to the active site of factor B, thereby preventing its interaction with C3b. This disruption blocks the formation of the C3 convertase, leading to a reduction in the generation of downstream complement activation fragments such as C3a, iC3b, and C5a, as well as limiting the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) on target cells like the RPE (Kavanagh et al., 2025; Qin et al., 2021). Biochemically, the high-affinity binding of iptacopan to factor B ensures that even under conditions of robust complement activation, the alternative pathway remains effectively suppressed. Importantly, because iptacopan acts upstream of the generation of key inflammatory mediators, it has the potential to modulate not only the biochemical cascade but also the subsequent cellular inflammatory response, which is known to drive RPE dysfunction and chronic inflammation associated with drusen formation in dry AMD (Patel et al., 2022; Weber et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis driving the repurposing of iptacopan for dry AMD is based on the established role of complement dysregulation in the pathogenesis of the disease. In dry AMD, genetic studies have repeatedly implicated variants in complement regulatory genes such as CFH (for example, the Y402H polymorphism) and risk alleles in other components of the alternative pathway, including factor B, in predisposing individuals to drusen accumulation and subsequent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration (Weber et al., 2014; Wilke & Apte, 2024). By preventing the assembly of the alternative pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb) through blockade of factor B, iptacopan is expected to reduce the local generation of pro-inflammatory complement fragments. Consequently, this reduction should lead to diminished deposition of MAC on the RPE, thereby preventing complement-mediated cell injury and attenuating drusen biogenesis (Patel et al., 2022; Wilke & Apte, 2024). In preclinical models, particularly in murine systems engineered to exhibit complement overactivation in the retina, administration of iptacopan has been shown to lower retinal C3b deposition substantially and preserve the overall integrity of the photoreceptor and RPE layers (Dreismann et al., 2023; Kavanagh et al., 2025). Given that complement proteins, including factor B, are expressed in the subretinal space and are involved in the pathologic accumulation of drusen, effective inhibition of these proteins is anticipated to stabilize RPE viability and ultimately slow disease progression in dry AMD (Park et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2021). The oral route of administration further suggests that systemic drug levels can be maintained consistently to counteract chronic complement hyperactivation, offering a convenient alternative to intravitreal injections, which are currently under investigation for other complement inhibitors (Novartis Pharmaceuticals, 2022; Wilke & Apte, 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Iptacopan presents a compelling therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration based on its robust mechanistic rationale, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and clinically validated efficacy in other complement-mediated diseases. One of its key strengths is its highly selective inhibition of complement factor B, which is indispensable for the assembly of the alternative pathway C3 convertase. This selectivity ensures that iptacopan effectively attenuates the pathological amplification of complement activation while leaving the classical and lectin pathways—which are crucial for host defense—largely intact (Kavanagh et al., 2025; Patel et al., 2022). The compound’s low-nanomolar potency and oral bioavailability provide major advantages in terms of patient convenience and adherence, which are critical factors for a chronic condition like dry AMD that currently lacks effective treatment options (Latour et al., 2021; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, 2021a).

The therapeutic history of iptacopan in diseases such as IgA nephropathy, PNH, and C3 glomerulopathy adds strong translational credibility to its repurposing strategy. In these indications, iptacopan has demonstrated clear biochemical efficacy by reducing circulating markers of complement activation (e.g., Ba and C3 fragments) and has been generally well tolerated in clinical trials (Kavanagh et al., 2025; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, 2021b). While no direct clinical trial data exist yet for dry AMD, the mechanistic similarity between complement-mediated glomerulopathies and the inflammatory processes involved in dry AMD — including RPE cell damage and drusen formation — makes iptacopan a promising candidate for further investigation in this indication (Patel et al., 2022; Wilke & Apte, 2024).

Mechanistically, the ability of iptacopan to prevent the formation of the alternative pathway C3 convertase is of central importance. By binding to factor B, the drug halts the conversion of C3 to its active fragments, thereby reducing the generation of inflammatory mediators such as C3a and C5a, as well as limiting MAC deposition. This action is expected to protect the RPE from complement-driven injury, thereby mitigating one of the key pathways leading to RPE loss and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration seen in dry AMD (Kavanagh et al., 2025; Qin et al., 2021). Preclinical models have provided evidence of this effect, demonstrating that factor B inhibition reduces retinal complement deposition and preserves cell structure, which further supports the theoretical basis for its application in AMD (Dreismann et al., 2023; Park et al., 2021).

Nevertheless, certain challenges must be acknowledged. One potential concern with complement inhibition, in general, is the increased risk of infections, particularly with encapsulated bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis. While vaccination strategies and appropriate prophylactic measures can mitigate this risk, any long-term use of iptacopan in an elderly population, inherently at risk for infections, will need careful monitoring (Wilke & Apte, 2024; Kavanagh et al., 2025). Additionally, while systemic oral administration is an advantage for chronic disease management, it remains to be confirmed whether sufficient drug concentrations can be achieved in the subretinal space to affect local complement activation, given the blood-retinal barriers. However, early pharmacokinetic studies and preclinical work suggest that oral bioavailability combined with potent systemic complement inhibition may translate to meaningful local effects in the retina (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Patel et al., 2022).

Overall, the strengths of iptacopan include its clear mechanism of action targeting a well-validated component of the complement cascade, demonstrated efficacy in related complement-mediated diseases, low-nanomolar potency, and favorable oral dosing profile. The repurposing of iptacopan for dry AMD is supported by robust genetic and biochemical evidence linking alternative pathway dysregulation to drusen formation and RPE damage. The main weaknesses or uncertainties center on the translation of systemic pharmacokinetics to effective ocular tissue concentrations, and the potential risk of immunosuppression-related infections, both of which will need to be clarified in dedicated clinical studies targeting dry AMD (Patel et al., 2022; Wilke & Apte, 2024).

In conclusion, the repurposing of iptacopan (LNP023) for dry AMD is strongly justified based on a comprehensive review of the biochemical, genetic, and clinical data. Its mechanism—blocking factor B to prevent assembly of the alternative pathway C3 convertase—directly targets the pathological processes responsible for drusen biogenesis and RPE degeneration. The candidate benefits from advanced clinical-stage data in related complement-mediated diseases, promising oral bioavailability, and a targeted mode of action that preserves other aspects of the complement system, thereby minimizing systemic immunosuppression. Although challenges such as achieving effective ocular tissue levels and managing infection risk remain, the overall evaluation strongly supports further investigation of iptacopan in clinical trials focused on dry AMD. This candidate represents a promising new approach to address a significant unmet medical need in an aging population, and its continued development should be prioritized as part of a broader strategic initiative in complement-targeted therapies for ocular diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kavanagh et al., 2025; Wilke & Apte, 2024).
