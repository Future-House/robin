Proposal for Avacincaptad pegol (Zimura; IVERIC bio), an RNA aptamer that selectively binds complement C5.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Avacincaptad pegol (marketed as Zimura) is a synthetically produced RNA aptamer developed by IVERIC Bio that selectively binds to complement component C5. It is generated using advanced aptamer selection techniques such as SELEX, which identifies high‐affinity oligonucleotide sequences capable of binding specific protein targets, and incorporates chemical modifications such as PEGylation to enhance stability and ocular bioavailability (Avery et al., 2020; Kang, 2023). This therapeutic candidate belongs to the class of nucleic acid–based aptamers, which have been utilized over the past two decades as targeted therapeutics in various diseases, including oncology and ophthalmology, owing to their ability to bind proteins with high specificity and affinity, rivaling monoclonal antibodies but with the advantages of synthetic modifiability and potentially lower immunogenicity (Avery et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2023). Aptamers in general have been used for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition (e.g., Macugen®) in certain ocular conditions and they represent a promising emerging platform for targeted complement inhibition in retinal diseases.

Therapeutic History:
Avacincaptad pegol has been investigated primarily in the context of dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), specifically aimed at reducing geographic atrophy (GA), a late‐stage manifestation of dry AMD associated with progressive loss of photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and choriocapillaris. Clinical evidence from a series of Phase II/III trials – notably the GATHER1 (reported in publications such as Patel et al., 2023) and GATHER2 studies, as well as data from multiple ClinicalTrials.gov entries (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020) – has shown that monthly intravitreal injections of Avacincaptad pegol reduce the mean growth rate of GA lesions by approximately 27% compared to sham treatment (Avery et al., 2020; Khanani et al., 2023; Unknown Reference). These studies have validated both the pharmacokinetic profile — demonstrating sustained ocular levels following intravitreal dosing — and the clinical efficacy of complement inhibition in reducing GA progression, which had been an unmet need in dry AMD until recent approvals (Khanani et al., 2023; Unknown Reference). Although aptamers have been applied in other ocular indications (for example, Macugen targeted VEGF for neovascular AMD), Avacincaptad pegol is among the first in its class to be rigorously tested for the treatment of GA and stands out as a pioneering complement inhibitor to modulate inflammatory cascades in dry AMD (Bandello et al., 2017; Kassa et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of Avacincaptad pegol is centered on its ability to bind selectively to complement component C5 with high nanomolar affinity, thereby sequestering it in the vitreous and subretinal spaces after intravitreal administration (Cao et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2021). Once administered, Avacincaptad pegol binds C5 and prevents its enzymatic cleavage into the potent anaphylatoxin C5a and the structural component C5b, which initiates the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The prevention of C5 cleavage is of crucial therapeutic importance because C5a is a powerful chemoattractant and activator of inflammatory cells such as microglia and macrophages, while C5b is essential for MAC assembly that disrupts cell membranes and contributes to RPE cell injury (Qin et al., 2021; Hammadi et al., 2023). Histopathological studies have demonstrated that MAC deposition is present in drusen and along Bruch’s membrane in AMD patients, linking uncontrolled complement activation to RPE damage and GA progression (Bandello et al., 2017; Kassa et al., 2019). By inhibiting C5, Avacincaptad pegol aims to reduce complement-mediated inflammation and cytolysis, thus stabilizing the retinal environment and potentially slowing the enlargement of GA lesions (Khanani et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024). On a molecular level, the binding interaction likely involves the recognition of a specific epitope on C5 that is critical for its cleavage by convertases, effectively interrupting the downstream complement cascade while leaving upstream functions largely intact (Cao et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2021).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for using Avacincaptad pegol in dry AMD is that its intravitreal administration will result in localized sequestration of C5 in the subretinal space, thereby preventing its cleavage into the active fragments C5a and C5b. This blockade is expected to inhibit the formation of the MAC, as well as reduce C5a-mediated recruitment and activation of local microglia and macrophages (Qin et al., 2024; Kassa et al., 2019). As a consequence, the reduction in local inflammatory responses and complement-mediated cytolysis would lead to diminished deposition of complement factors in drusen and along Bruch’s membrane. Clinically, this is anticipated to slow the progression of GA lesion enlargement, as evidenced by Phase II/III clinical trial results that demonstrated an approximate 27% reduction in GA growth rate compared to sham over a one-year period (Khanani et al., 2023; Patel et al., 2023). Moreover, relevant studies have also suggested that complement activation products are elevated in the eyes of patients with AMD, and the C5 protein is expressed in the RPE and choriocapillaris where it participates in inflammatory signaling. Therefore, by specifically targeting and neutralizing C5, the therapy should mitigate key pathogenic drivers such as the activation of microglia, local cytokine release, and RPE cell loss, thereby preserving retinal structure and function (Hammadi et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024). The expected outcome in proposed assays measuring inflammatory markers, GA lesion area via fundus autofluorescence, and visual acuity would be a demonstrable deceleration of disease progression, translating into preservation of central vision over time (Khanani et al., 2023; Patel et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
The collective literature and clinical evidence support the potential of Avacincaptad pegol as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD, particularly in slowing the progression of geographic atrophy. One of its strongest advantages is the well-defined mechanism of action, where selective inhibition of complement C5 directly addresses the inflammatory and cytolytic pathways implicated in RPE damage. Multiple preclinical and clinical studies have validated that blocking C5 can lead to a significant reduction in GA lesion growth, as seen by the approximately 27% slowing in lesion progression in Phase II/III trials (Khanani et al., 2023; Patel et al., 2023). Additionally, the unique delivery of an RNA aptamer via intravitreal injection ensures that the drug is concentrated at the site of pathology, reducing systemic exposure and potentially limiting off-target effects (Cao et al., 2023; Fujii et al., 2025).

However, there are also important challenges and potential drawbacks. A notable safety concern identified during clinical trials is the increased incidence of macular neovascularization (MNV) or choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in treatment groups compared with sham controls; for instance, conversion rates to MNV were reported as high as 11.9% for the 2 mg dose and 15.7% for the 4 mg dose compared to approximately 2.7% in controls (Khanani et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2021). This adverse event may be attributed to complement inhibition altering the local angiogenic balance, and it necessitates comprehensive monitoring and potential adjunct therapies to manage neovascular complications. Moreover, as with most intravitreal therapies, the requirement for monthly injections imposes a significant treatment burden on patients, which could limit adherence and overall treatment satisfaction (Moreira, 2022; Patel et al., 2023). In terms of biochemical specificity, while Avacincaptad pegol has been optimized for high-affinity binding to C5, variability in patient response due to genetic heterogeneity in complement pathway components might influence the overall efficacy (Qin et al., 2024; Kassa et al., 2019).

Overall, Avacincaptad pegol exhibits a robust scientific rationale and has demonstrated promising clinical efficacy in reducing geographic atrophy progression in dry AMD. Its strengths lie in its specific, targeted mechanism of action against a well-validated pathological driver, favorable pharmacokinetic properties in the ocular compartment, and data-supported efficacy from pivotal trials. At the same time, the risk of neovascular complications and the logistic challenges associated with frequent intravitreal injections represent significant hurdles that must be carefully mitigated in ongoing and future studies. Consequently, from a drug development and validation perspective, Avacincaptad pegol stands out as a promising therapeutic candidate with a clearly defined pathway to regulatory approval, provided that safety concerns are rigorously managed and patient adherence is optimized (Khanani et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2024).
