Proposal for SMER28 (Small-Molecule Enhancer of Rapamycin 28; Tocris catalog 4873), a beclin-1–dependent autophagy inducer.

Below is a detailed evaluation of SMER28 as a therapeutic candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (dry AMD):

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SMER28 (Small‐Molecule Enhancer of Rapamycin 28; Tocris catalog 4873) is a chemically synthesized small molecule that was originally discovered through high‐throughput screening campaigns designed to identify novel modulators of autophagic flux. Unlike classical mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin, SMER28 was identified for its ability to enhance autophagy in a manner independent of direct mTOR inhibition. Early screening efforts focused on compounds capable of amplifying the cellular autophagic machinery, aiming to overcome the off‐target effects commonly associated with pan‐mTOR suppression. SMER28 belongs to a broader class of compounds known as Small Molecule Enhancers of Rapamycin (SMERs), a group which has been used primarily as experimental tools to dissect autophagy pathways in various cell models, including neurodegenerative disease paradigms. The chemical structure of SMER28 is based on heterocyclic scaffolds, with modifications (often incorporating quinazoline derivatives) that favor cell permeability and bioactivity, which are designed and optimized through standard organic synthesis methods – these methods involve multi‐step reactions using reagents that are typical in kinase modulator chemistry. Its discovery and subsequent chemical optimization have provided a structure–activity relationship (SAR) that underscores its potential for repurposing, as its ability to enhance autophagic flux has been well‐documented in biochemical assays (Koukourakis et al., 2018; Nekova et al., 2014). Moreover, this class of compounds initially emerged from studies aimed at overcoming the limitations of mTOR‐dependent autophagy inducers, making SMER28 a compelling candidate for diseases in which improved targeted clearance of intracellular debris is central to therapeutic efficacy.

Therapeutic History:
SMER28 has been extensively studied in preclinical settings outside the realm of ophthalmology. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that SMER28 is capable of driving the conversion of the autophagy marker LC3 from its cytosolic form (LC3-I) to the lipidated autophagosome-associated form (LC3-II). These studies have been carried out in multiple cell lines, suggesting that the compound effectively reduces the accumulation of p62 aggregates, a hallmark of impaired autophagic flux. In cellular models of neurodegeneration, particularly in experiments using dopaminergic cells exposed to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), SMER28 provided significant neuroprotection by attenuating cytotoxicity, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and preserving mitochondrial integrity (Darabi et al., 2019). This neuroprotective effect supports the idea that SMER28 could bolster autophagic clearance pathways, offering a mechanism by which cells can rid themselves of aggregated or oxidatively damaged proteins. In addition to its neuroprotective applications, SMER28 has also been explored in antiviral research. For instance, in studies investigating human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication, SMER28 was shown to inhibit viral replication through its capacity to modulate autophagy independent of mTOR inhibition, suggesting that its mechanism might be beneficial in pathological contexts involving aberrant intracellular clearance (Clark et al., 2018). Furthermore, investigations targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis have revealed that SMER28 directly inhibits the p110δ isoform of class I PI3K – an activity that has been exploited in models testing anti-proliferative and anticancer effects (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a). Although these studies have primarily focused on neurodegeneration, oncology, and antiviral contexts, an examination of data from clinical trial databases reveals that there is growing interest in repurposing autophagy enhancers, including SMER28, for retinal degenerative diseases such as dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Vessey et al., 2022). Despite no clinical trial having yet confirmed its efficacy in dry AMD specifically, the robust preclinical profile across diverse indications provides a strong rationale for development in this indication.

Mechanism of Action:
SMER28 operates through a multifaceted and complex mechanism that ultimately converges on the stimulation of autophagy. At the heart of its activity is the upregulation of beclin-1–dependent autophagic pathways. Beclin-1 is a critical protein in the initiation of autophagosome formation; it forms a core component of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex which catalyzes the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), a lipid pivotal for nucleating the autophagic membrane. SMER28 treatment has been associated with an increased conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in several cell models, which is further supported by a reduction in p62 levels, indicating a boost in autophagic clearance capacity (Darabi et al., 2019; Kirchenwitz et al., 2022b). Importantly, unlike rapamycin, which activates autophagy by directly inhibiting mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), SMER28 does not rely on mTOR inhibition. Instead, it has been shown to modulate autophagy through alternative pathways: one aspect involves direct inhibition of the class I PI3K catalytic subunit p110δ. Inhibition of this kinase facilitates a decrease in the phosphorylation of Akt at threonine 308 and serine 473, relieving inhibitory signals on autophagy and thereby skewing cellular homeostasis towards an autophagic state (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a). This selective inhibition not only promotes autophagy but also impairs receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated signaling pathways that otherwise drive cell growth and inflammation.

Additionally, SMER28 has been reported to engage the activity of valosin-containing protein (VCP), a key regulator of protein homeostasis that is involved in both autophagic and proteasomal degradation pathways. SMER28 appears to bind directly to VCP and stimulates its D1 ATPase activity. This activation has two important consequences. First, it facilitates the assembly and activation of the PI3K complex that includes VPS34, ATG14L, and beclin-1, thereby enhancing the production of PI(3)P necessary for autophagy initiation (Wrobel et al., 2022). Second, the stimulation of VCP activity enhances the proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, which is an important adjunct to autophagic clearance in maintaining overall protein quality control. In some experimental systems, SMER28 has also been associated with modulation of microtubule dynamics, leading to increased tubulin acetylation and stabilization of the cytoskeletal network. These effects on the microtubule system may further facilitate autophagosomal transport and fusion with lysosomes, enhancing the overall efficiency of the degradation process (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022b). The critical requirement of beclin-1 for SMER28’s effect has been validated in studies where loss of beclin-1 function abrogated the increases in LC3-II expression and autophagosome formation seen with SMER28 treatment (Wrobel et al., 2022). Overall, SMER28’s mechanism is distinct because it simultaneously inhibits pro-survival and proliferation signals through PI3K p110δ inhibition and promotes autophagic clearance through both beclin-1–dependent autophagy initiation and VCP-mediated proteostatic mechanisms (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a; Koukourakis et al., 2018).

Expected Effect:
The working hypothesis for utilizing SMER28 in the context of dry AMD is rooted in the role that impaired autophagy and lysosomal dysfunction play in the pathology of the disease. Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, which are critically involved in supporting photoreceptor health and overall retinal homeostasis, tend to accumulate toxic deposits such as drusen—a composite of oxidized lipids, lipofuscin, and other cellular debris—as a result of deteriorating autophagic capacity. These deposits can trigger inflammatory cascades, including activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and complement system, leading to progressive RPE degeneration and vision loss. It is expected that by activating beclin-1–dependent autophagy, SMER28 will enhance the clearance of these drusen constituents. In doing so, it should restore lysosomal integrity and reduce secondary inflammatory signals (Kaarniranta et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2015).

In vitro, SMER28 has already been shown to increase the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, indicative of robust autophagic flux; it simultaneously reduces p62 levels, thereby clearing toxic protein aggregates and damaged organelles. These molecular markers are crucial because, in RPE cells, efficient autophagy is essential not only for removing debris but also for maintaining mitochondrial function and limiting oxidative stress. Analogous studies in neurodegenerative models have shown that enhanced autophagic activity correlates with improved clearance of misfolded proteins and damaged mitochondria, which is directly translatable to the dysfunctional processes observed in dry AMD (Darabi et al., 2019).

Moreover, given that SMER28 has been observed to inhibit PI3K p110δ, it is anticipated that such modulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway may reduce abnormal pro-survival signals that, in the context of stress, can exacerbate inflammation. Inhibiting these signals in a controlled fashion may further help limit the overactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a process implicated in the inflammatory pathology of dry AMD (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a). Furthermore, the activation of VCP by SMER28 is expected to bolster protein quality control mechanisms by enhancing the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This dual action—improved clearance of toxic aggregates via autophagy and proteasomal pathways—can potentially stabilize RPE cell function under conditions of chronic oxidative stress and metabolic challenge.

The RPE cells have been shown in other studies to express high levels of beclin-1 and autophagy-related markers under stress conditions, and the restoration of autophagic function in these cells could lead to a decrease in drusen formation and an overall improvement in retinal homeostasis. Although direct experimental data in RPE cell models for SMER28 are limited, the effects seen in other cell systems suggest that under oxidative stress conditions, similar improvements in mitochondrial quality control, reduced accumulation of debris, and decreased inflammatory cytokine production may be achievable. Additionally, preclinical data in murine retinal models have demonstrated that autophagy enhancers can reduce lipofuscin-like deposits and preserve RPE morphology, implying that SMER28 might exert similar beneficial effects if applied to such models (Vessey et al., 2022).

It is also anticipated that by promoting autophagic flux, SMER28 will help clear potentially cytotoxic aggregates that not only trigger inflammation but also impair lysosomal enzyme function—a critical component in RPE cell survival. The combined effects—targeting drusen clearance, limiting inflammasome activation, and improving mitochondrial integrity—are expected to ultimately preserve the structural and functional integrity of the RPE, which is essential for maintaining vision in dry AMD patients (Gunawan et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2015).

Overall Evaluation:
An extensive literature review based on the available data indicates that SMER28 is a strong candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD. One of the primary strengths of SMER28 is its uniquely multifactorial mechanism of action; it acts to stimulate autophagic flux in a manner that is dependent on beclin-1, while simultaneously inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway through selective inhibition of the p110δ subunit, and activating VCP to promote both autophagy and proteasomal clearance. This combination of mechanistic actions directly addresses several of the key pathophysiological processes in dry AMD—namely, the accumulation of drusen constituents composed of oxidized lipids, lipofuscin, and other cellular debris, along with the secondary inflammatory cascades mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation and complement deposition (Darabi et al., 2019; Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a; Wrobel et al., 2022). The mTOR-independent nature of SMER28 is particularly noteworthy because it offers the possibility of inducing autophagy without the systemic side effects associated with mTOR inhibition, such as immunosuppression and metabolic disturbance. This is an important consideration given that chronic conditions like dry AMD require treatments with minimal long-term adverse effects (Koukourakis et al., 2018; Kirchenwitz et al., 2022b).

Furthermore, the preclinical evidence supporting the efficacy of SMER28 in other cellular models—ranging from neurodegeneration, where mitochondrial quality control and protein aggregate clearance are vital, to studies in antiviral contexts—suggests that the underlying cellular mechanisms governing autophagic flux are sufficiently conserved such that benefits seen elsewhere could translate to the RPE. In neurodegenerative cell models, for example, SMER28 reduced toxic protein aggregates and restored mitochondrial function; both of these outcomes are desirable in the treatment of dry AMD, where similar cellular stresses occur. The observation that SMER28 can induce G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibit growth factor-dependent pathways further supports its potential to modulate inflammatory and proliferative signals that contribute to disease pathology (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a).

Nevertheless, several weaknesses and gaps in the current research must be acknowledged before SMER28 can be advanced confidently for dry AMD. For one, direct evidence of its efficacy in RPE cells or in animal models specifically engineered to mimic dry AMD pathology remains sparse. Although biochemical markers of autophagy improvement (increased LC3-II, decreased p62) have been robustly documented in other systems, the unique physiology of RPE cells—with their high metabolic demand, chronic oxidative stress, and complex intracellular trafficking requirements—necessitates specific validation. Studies in RPE cells would need to confirm that SMER28 can indeed clear drusen constituents, reduce lysosomal destabilization, and mitigate inflammatory signaling driven by the NLRP3 inflammasome and complement activation (Gunawan et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2015).

Another consideration is the potential for off-target effects arising from SMER28’s inhibition of the PI3K p110δ isoform. Although selective inhibition of p110δ is attractive in some contexts, PI3K is expressed ubiquitously and plays essential roles in many cellular processes including cell survival, metabolism, and immune responses. Thus, systemic exposure to SMER28 could, in theory, lead to unintended effects in tissues outside the retina if proper pharmacokinetic and delivery strategies are not established. Such concerns might be mitigated by exploring localized delivery approaches (for example, intravitreal injections or advanced nanoparticle formulations), which could limit systemic exposure while maximizing retinal bioavailability (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a; Park & Lee, 2022).

The mechanism of action of SMER28 also places considerable reliance on the proper functioning of beclin-1. In advanced stages of AMD, it is possible that beclin-1 expression or function may be compromised, which could limit the efficacy of any therapeutic reliant on this pathway. Consequently, it will be important to assess beclin-1 levels in diseased RPE cells and to determine whether SMER28 can overcome any intrinsic deficiencies in the autophagy machinery. Such studies will be critical for informing patient selection and stratifying potential responders in future clinical trials (Ochoa et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2015).

Additional challenges include the detailed characterization of ocular pharmacokinetics and long-term safety profiles of SMER28 in the context of the retinal microenvironment. Although its small-molecule nature and defined SAR profile are promising for further medicinal chemistry optimization, the complex architecture of the eye—which includes barriers such as the blood-retina barrier—means that extensive studies will be required to ensure adequate penetration, sustained therapeutic levels in the RPE, and minimal toxicity upon chronic administration. The possibility of off-target kinase inhibition, even if minimal according to some kinase profiling studies, must be rigorously assessed in both in vitro and in vivo retinal models before clinical development is pursued (Wrobel et al., 2022; Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a).

In summary, SMER28 presents a highly intriguing and mechanistically sophisticated candidate for development as a treatment for dry AMD. Its ability to induce autophagy independently of mTOR inhibition, coupled with direct inhibition of critical signaling nodes such as PI3K p110δ and activation of VCP-mediated proteostatic mechanisms, directly addresses the pathological features of dry AMD, including impaired clearance of drusen constituents, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation. The preclinical evidence gathered from models of neurodegeneration, viral replication, and basic autophagy research provides a strong rationale for repurposing SMER28 in the retinal context (Darabi et al., 2019; Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a; Wrobel et al., 2022).

However, before SMER28 can be translated into the clinic for dry AMD, several key areas require further investigation. First, direct studies in RPE cell models must confirm that the compound induces robust autophagic clearance of drusen-related materials and improves RPE cell viability. Second, appropriate animal models that mimic human dry AMD should be utilized to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of SMER28, particularly with respect to reversing or halting the progression of RPE degeneration. Third, detailed pharmacokinetic studies are needed to ascertain the best methods for delivering SMER28 to the retina, whether via topical, intravitreal, or other localized routes, to limit systemic exposure and potential off-target effects. Fourth, because SMER28 operates via beclin-1–dependent autophagy, it will be essential to characterize the status of beclin-1 and other autophagy-related proteins in the RPE of AMD patients, which may influence therapeutic outcomes. Finally, long-term toxicity studies must be undertaken to ensure that chronic modulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and VCP activity does not adversely affect retinal function or elicit unintended systemic consequences (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Vessey et al., 2022).

In conclusion, SMER28 exhibits several compelling attributes as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its multifaceted mode of autophagy enhancement—through beclin-1 upregulation, PI3K p110δ inhibition, and VCP activation—aligns well with the need to restore efficient cellular clearance mechanisms in the RPE, thereby addressing the underlying pathogenesis of drusen accumulation and chronic inflammation. The mTOR-independent nature of SMER28 further reduces the potential for adverse effects associated with systemic mTOR inhibition, which could be particularly beneficial over the long-term treatment courses necessary in chronic degenerative diseases such as dry AMD. While the preclinical data from diverse disease models are encouraging, direct evidence in the context of retinal physiology is currently insufficient and represents the most significant gap in the literature. Addressing this gap through dedicated studies in RPE-specific in vitro models and relevant animal models will be critical to validate whether the hypothesized benefits regarding drusen clearance and preservation of RPE health can be realized in vivo. If these challenges can be met with rigorous experimental design and careful optimization of drug delivery parameters, SMER28 may indeed offer a novel and much-needed treatment option for patients suffering from dry AMD—a condition for which there remains a significant unmet clinical need (Zhang et al., 2015; Gunawan et al., 2021).

Overall, the combined strengths of SMER28—its well-defined mechanism, its capacity to enhance autophagic flux independently of mTOR, and its potential to modulate multiple pathways involved in proteostasis and inflammatory signaling—make it a promising candidate worthy of further investigation for dry AMD. The weaknesses, particularly the lack of direct RPE-centric data and potential off-target effects inherent in systemic PI3K inhibition, must be addressed with carefully designed preclinical experiments. Should these hurdles be overcome, SMER28 could transition from being an effective research tool to a therapeutic asset for restoring retinal function and slowing the progression of dry AMD, thereby significantly improving patient outcomes in a disease area with very limited treatment options (Kirchenwitz et al., 2022a; Wrobel et al., 2022; Darabi et al., 2019).
