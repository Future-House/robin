Hypothesis: Complement Pathway Modulation

Query: You are a professional biomedical researcher, having experience in early-stage drug discovery and validation in vitro. Your task is to evaluate cell culture assays that would be used to evaluate drugs to treat dry age-related macular degeneration.
Given the following assay, do a comprehensive literature review to evaluate if this assay would be useful for testing therapeutics for dry age-related macular degeneration. Search relevant literature across
biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature about the disease or therapeutic landscape. Don't look up specific drugs, but any relevant scientific information that may inform assay development.Strategy: Complement Pathway Modulation
Reasoning: Chronic complement activation drives RPE injury and drusen formation in dry AMD (Borchert et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023). Exposing polarized RPE monolayers to human serum and candidate complement inhibitors, followed by ELISA quantification of C3a/C5a and immunostaining for membrane attack complex deposition, provides a direct readout of complement‐mediated damage. Combining these biochemical assays with transepithelial resistance measurements yields a fast, biologically relevant assessment of barrier integrity rescue.Provide your response in the following format, like an evaluation for a scientific proposal:

Overall Evaluation: Strengths and weaknesses of this assay for testing therapeutics for dry age-related macular degeneration.

Assay Overview:
The proposed assay involves exposing polarized retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) monolayers to complement‐active human serum in the presence or absence of candidate complement inhibitors. This approach directly models a key aspect of dry AMD pathogenesis: sublytic complement activation leading to RPE dysfunction, barrier breakdown, and drusen formation. The assay measurements include quantification of complement activation products (i.e., C3a and C5a) using ELISA, immunostaining for deposition of the membrane attack complex (MAC), and assessment of transepithelial resistance (TER) to evaluate barrier integrity. The cellular material used in the assay consists of mature, polarized RPE monolayers, which may be derived from cell lines such as ARPE-19 or from iPSC‐derived RPE that recapitulate native RPE physiology (annamalai2021naturalimmunoglobulinmbased pages 3-4, bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 9-11).

Biomedical Evidence:
Chronic complement activation is central to dry AMD pathogenesis. In vivo and in vitro evidence indicates that complement dysregulation in the RPE leads to the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors, deposition of drusen-related proteins, and ultimately RPE degeneration (sharma2021epithelialphenotyperestoring pages 1-2). Clinical and genetic studies have shown that variants in complement pathway components, such as CFH, are strongly associated with AMD risk, supporting the notion that aberrant complement activation triggers inflammatory injury which culminates in the phenotype observed in dry AMD (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 17-19, schikora2025maturationdependentcomplementproduction pages 32-35). Furthermore, experimental models have demonstrated that exposure of RPE cells to activated complement significantly alters their barrier function and leads to dysregulated secretion of pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory factors, such as VEGF, which are implicated in disease progression (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 16-17).

Previous Use:
This assay format has been validated in several studies using polarized RPE cells in combination with human serum to mimic complement activation. Previous research has utilized ELISA-based quantification of C3a and C5a, alongside immunostaining for MAC deposition, to observe the effects of complement inhibitors such as CR2-fH; these studies have shown that targeted inhibition can reduce inflammatory signaling and preserve barrier integrity (annamalai2021naturalimmunoglobulinmbased pages 3-4). Additionally, similar assay systems have been used to screen for drugs that restore RPE function by preventing complement-mediated damage, as evidenced by improvements in TER measurements and decreases in inflammatory mediator release (sharma2021epithelialphenotyperestoring pages 13-14, bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 28-29). These studies not only confirm the relevance of complement activation in AMD pathology but also highlight the utility of combining biochemical assays with functional readouts of barrier integrity for drug evaluation (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 12-14).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of this assay are its direct alignment with the disease’s pathogenesis and its multiparametric design. By measuring both biochemical (ELISA for C3a/C5a, MAC immunostaining) and functional (TER) endpoints, the assay enables a comprehensive evaluation of how candidate therapeutics modulate complement activation and rescue RPE barrier function. This dual approach is particularly advantageous for early-stage drug discovery where mechanistic insights into drug action are essential. The use of polarized RPE monolayers further enhances the physiological relevance of the assay, capturing key aspects of RPE morphology and function that are critical in dry AMD (annamalai2021naturalimmunoglobulinmbased pages 3-4, bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 9-11).

However, limitations include variability in RPE cell models, especially when comparing immortalized cell lines with iPSC-derived RPE, which may require rigorous standardization of culture and differentiation protocols before widespread application. Moreover, while in vitro evidence is robust, translatability to the clinical setting remains an open question since only a few clinical trials currently integrate these specific assay modalities (Clinical Trials Search: complement pathway AND age-related macular degeneration AND (cell OR in vitro OR complement activation OR RPE model)). Overall, the assay represents a biologically relevant and well-supported platform for evaluating complement-targeted therapeutics in dry AMD, with prospects for further refinement and validation in preclinical settings (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 16-17, sharma2021epithelialphenotyperestoring pages 13-14).
