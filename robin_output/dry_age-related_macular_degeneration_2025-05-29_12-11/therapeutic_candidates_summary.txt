Therapeutic Candidate 1:
Candidate: Iptacopan (LNP023), a selective small-molecule inhibitor of complement factor B (Novartis; no special formulation required).
Hypothesis: Oral administration of iptacopan will prevent assembly of the alternative‐pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb) in the subretinal space by blocking factor B’s binding and cleavage of C3b. This will reduce local generation of C3a, iC3b and downstream C5 activation fragments, leading to diminished membrane attack complex (MAC) deposition on RPE cells, attenuated drusen biogenesis, and preservation of RPE viability in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Genetic studies (CFH Y402H and other AP risk alleles) and functional assays link alternative‐pathway overactivation to drusen formation and RPE loss. Factor B is indispensable for the AP C3 convertase, making it a high‐confidence, disease‐specific target. Iptacopan shows low‐nanomolar potency (IC50∼1 nM) against factor B, oral bioavailability, and favorable ADME/safety in Phase II trials for complement‐mediated glomerulopathies, where it dose-dependently reduces Ba and C3 activation fragments in blood. In CFH-knockout and AP-overactivation murine retina models, iptacopan decreases retinal C3b deposition and preserves photoreceptor/RPE structure. Its clear mechanism (factor B blockade) and advanced clinical‐stage data support translational feasibility for dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 2:
Candidate: MCC950 (CRID3; Selleckchem catalog SML2236), a potent, selective small-molecule NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor.
Hypothesis: Systemic or local delivery of MCC950 will bind the NACHT domain of NLRP3 in RPE cells, blocking ATP‐dependent oligomerization and caspase-1 activation. In dry AMD, this will interrupt the feed-forward loop whereby complement fragments (C3a/C5a) and ROS prime NLRP3, thereby reducing IL-1β/IL-18 release, preventing pyroptotic RPE death, and maintaining barrier integrity.
Reasoning: Genome‐wide and functional studies implicate NLRP3 inflammasome activation in RPE degeneration downstream of complement dysregulation and oxidative stress. In iPSC-derived RPE with CFH risk alleles, MCC950 reduces caspase-1 cleavage, IL-1β secretion, and propidium-iodide uptake. In murine models of geographic atrophy, systemic MCC950 lowers retinal IL-18, preserves RPE morphology, and improves ERG responses. The compound has established rodent PK/PD, with a defined therapeutic window for inflammasome inhibition without broad immunosuppression. Target specificity and strong preclinical efficacy in AMD-relevant models support its development for dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 3:
Candidate: Elamipretide (SS-31, MTP-131), a mitochondria-targeted tetrapeptide (Stealth BioTherapeutics).
Hypothesis: Elamipretide will selectively bind cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane of RPE cells, stabilizing cristae architecture, enhancing electron transport chain efficiency, and reducing mitochondrial ROS. By lowering ROS, it will diminish oxidative‐stress–driven complement activation and inflammasome priming, improve autophagic flux, and curtail inflammatory cytokine release, thereby slowing drusen formation and RPE degeneration in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are central to dry AMD pathogenesis and synergize with complement overactivation to damage RPE. Elamipretide restores mitochondrial bioenergetics in human RPE cultures, reduces mitochondrial superoxide, and improves lysosomal function. In a Phase I/II open-label trial in geographic atrophy (NCT02848313), subcutaneous elamipretide was safe, improved low-luminance visual acuity, and reduced GA growth rates. Its defined mechanism—cardiolipin stabilization—targets a validated upstream driver of complement and inflammasome activation, with established translational and safety profiles.

Therapeutic Candidate 4:
Candidate: SMER28 (Small-Molecule Enhancer of Rapamycin 28; Tocris catalog 4873), a beclin-1–dependent autophagy inducer.
Hypothesis: SMER28 will activate beclin-1–mediated autophagy in RPE cells independently of mTOR inhibition, enhancing clearance of drusen constituents (oxidized lipids, lipofuscin) and damaged organelles. By restoring autophagic flux, it will reduce lysosomal destabilization, limit NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and decrease complement fragment deposition, thereby preserving RPE health in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Autophagy impairment and lysosomal dysfunction are well characterized in AMD RPE pathology, leading to drusen accumulation and inflammasome‐driven inflammation. SMER28 was identified in high-throughput screens as a selective autophagy enhancer that increases LC3-II conversion, reduces p62 aggregates, and improves mitochondrial quality control. In murine retinal models, SMER28 reduces lipofuscin-like deposits and maintains RPE morphology under oxidative challenge. Its small-molecule nature, known SAR profile, and clear mechanism of action support preclinical optimization and therapeutic development for dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 5:
Candidate: Avacincaptad pegol (Zimura; IVERIC bio), an RNA aptamer that selectively binds complement C5.
Hypothesis: Intravitreal avacincaptad pegol will sequester C5 in the subretinal space, preventing its cleavage into C5a and C5b and thereby blocking membrane attack complex formation and C5a-mediated recruitment/activation of microglia and macrophages. This will reduce local inflammation, limit drusen‐associated complement deposition, and slow geographic atrophy progression in dry AMD.
Reasoning: C5 activation and MAC deposition are key drivers of RPE cell injury in dry AMD. Histological studies show MAC in drusen and Bruch’s membrane zones. Avacincaptad pegol has high nanomolar affinity for C5, with intravitreal PK demonstrating sustained ocular levels. In Phase II/III trials, monthly intravitreal dosing reduced GA lesion growth by ~27% at one year versus sham. Its well-defined mechanism, ocular delivery route, and clinical efficacy in dry AMD provide robust validation and a clear path to regulatory approval.
