Query: Which primary human retinal pigment epithelium cell cultures, immortalized lines (e.g., ARPE-19), iPSC-derived RPE monolayers, co-culture systems with photoreceptors, and three-dimensional retinal organoids have been characterized to model features of dry AMD pathology in vitro, and what protocols are used to induce hallmark phenotypes such as drusen-like deposit accumulation, oxidative injury, and complement-mediated damage?

Primary human RPE cultures have been derived from both fetal and adult sources and are widely employed because of their capacity to form a polarized, pigmented, cobblestone monolayer that recapitulates native RPE functions. For example, early passage fetal RPE cells cultured for two to four months accumulate basal laminar-like deposits with fibrillar material and long spacing collagen, recapitulating key aspects of sub-RPE deposit formation seen in dry AMD (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 16-17). In addition, primary human RPE cultures have been used to assess secretome and proteome changes under oxidative and complement stress, serving as a benchmark for evaluating in vitro AMD phenotypes (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 20-22).

Immortalized cell lines, such as ARPE-19, have been characterized extensively despite limitations regarding chromosomal aberrations and incomplete differentiation. Optimized culture protocols have improved ARPE-19 polarization and epithelial features, making them useful for mechanistic studies and genome editing approaches. These cells are also effective in modeling complement-mediated damage and can be subjected to chronic oxidative stress protocols to induce drusen-like deposit accumulation (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 3-4, bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 19-20).

Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE monolayers represent a major advance in disease modeling because they can be generated in a patient-specific manner, harboring high-risk AMD genotypes such as those in CFH (e.g., Y402H) and ARMS2/HTRA1. These iPSC-RPE cells, when cultured under defined differentiation protocols, display native-like RPE morphology, phagocytic function, and metabolic activity. Pharmacological studies with iPSC-RPE have demonstrated measurable functional deficits, including decreased mitochondrial function and antioxidant capacity, particularly after being subjected to induced stress conditions. These monolayers have been used to model complement activation, with complement components like C3a and C5a triggering sub-RPE lipid deposition and other AMD-relevant inflammatory responses (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 12-14, bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 17-19).

Co-culture systems have been established to better mimic the retinal microenvironment by integrating RPE with photoreceptors, and in some cases with endothelial cells or choroidal fibroblasts. For instance, RPE-photoreceptor co-cultures allow investigation of direct intercellular interactions crucial for photoreceptor support and phagocytosis, while RPE-endothelial cocultures (often on transwell setups) enhance barrier properties and more faithfully recapitulate choroidal angiogenesis and inflammatory cues. These integrated models are especially useful for assessing complement-mediated damage since they allow the study of paracrine signaling effects on complement activation, tight junction integrity, and NF-kB pathway activation (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 14-16, wu2022tissueengineeringin pages 6-7).

Three-dimensional retinal organoids, derived from pluripotent stem cells, offer an advanced platform that replicates layered retinal architecture and cellular complexity. These organoids combine multiple retinal cell types, including photoreceptors and RPE, thus permitting the study of intercellular crosstalk and the induction of AMD-like phenotypes under more physiologically relevant conditions. Organoids and retina-on-a-chip microfluidic platforms are now being used to induce hallmarks of dry AMD including drusen-like deposit accumulation, oxidative injury, and complement-mediated responses by exposing these systems to modulated metabolic, oxidative, and inflammatory stresses (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 27-28, bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 29-32).

Protocols to induce hallmark phenotypes in these models typically involve the use of oxidative stressors such as hydrogen peroxide or tert-butyl hydroperoxide to simulate oxidative injury and mitochondrial dysfunction. In parallel, exposure to human serum or oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) has been employed to trigger drusen-like deposit formation through the accumulation of AMD-associated proteins, including APOE, vitronectin, and clusterin. Complement-mediated damage is induced by supplementing cultures with complement proteins (e.g., C3a, C5a) or by genetic manipulation of complement regulatory pathways (e.g., using CFH-deficient cells or cells harboring the Y402H allele). Additionally, pro-inflammatory cytokines, hypoxia, and long-term culture under low serum or metabolic modulation conditions (e.g., nicotinamide treatment) are incorporated into protocols to enhance AMD-relevant stress responses and extracellular matrix deposition (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 16-17, bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 23-24, bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 28-29).

Together, these diverse model systems and protocols allow for a comprehensive in vitro replication of dry AMD hallmarks, enabling detailed mechanistic studies and high-throughput therapeutic testing in a controlled environment (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 3-4, wu2022tissueengineeringin pages 11-12).
