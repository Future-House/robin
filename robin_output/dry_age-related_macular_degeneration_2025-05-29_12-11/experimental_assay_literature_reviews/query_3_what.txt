Query: What sensitive and scalable functional assays and biochemical readouts are available for evaluating therapeutic modulation of dry AMD phenotypes in RPE cell culture models, including high-content imaging for drusen precursor and lipofuscin accumulation, transepithelial resistance measurements for barrier integrity, quantification of reactive oxygen species, autophagic flux assays, complement activation fragments, inflammasome-associated cytokines, mitochondrial respiration, and phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments?

The available approaches comprise a multifaceted battery of sensitive and scalable assays that interrogate both structural and biochemical features of RPE cells, capturing many pathophysiological hallmarks of dry AMD. These methodologies include high-content imaging to detect the accumulation of drusen precursor deposits and lipofuscin granules, which serve as key morphological indicators. Specifically, high-content imaging platforms allow for precise quantification through fluorescence labeling of specific cellular components and organelles, thereby enabling robust screening in patient‑derived or stem‑cell‑derived RPE cultures (ebeling2022testingmitochondrialtargeteddrugs pages 15-17, meyer2019proteomeandsecretome pages 10-10).

Trans-epithelial resistance (TER) measurements are a cornerstone functional assay that evaluates the integrity of RPE monolayers by quantifying the tight junction function. TER is typically measured using volt-ohm meters like the Millicell-ERS system and provides a rapid, reproducible readout of epithelial barrier functionality—a critical aspect of RPE health and a sensitive indicator of AMD-like phenotypes (fisher2022humanipscand pages 14-15, ebeling2022testingmitochondrialtargeteddrugs pages 4-6).

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) quantification assays are indispensable given the central role of oxidative stress in AMD pathogenesis. These assays employ fluorescent probes or luminescence-based reagents to detect ROS levels in living cells, thereby providing a direct measure of oxidative damage and cellular stress. Such quantification is integral to evaluating the effects of mitochondrial dysfunction and the therapeutic efficacy of antioxidant or mitochondrial-targeted interventions (lenin2023dysfunctionalautophagyproteostasis pages 4-5, meyer2019proteomeandsecretome pages 10-10).

Autophagic flux assays are used to evaluate the efficiency of the cell’s degradation pathways. By monitoring markers such as LC3 and p62—or by employing specific fluorescent reporters that detect autolysosome formation—these assays clarify whether autophagy is adequately removing damaged organelles and protein aggregates, an essential process that is often impaired in AMD RPE cells (ebeling2022testingmitochondrialtargeteddrugs pages 4-6, ebeling2022testingmitochondrialtargeteddrugs pages 15-17).

Measurement of complement activation fragments is another important biochemical readout. These assays generally use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or multiplex platforms to detect fragments like C3a or C5a, which are key readouts for complement system activation, thereby linking immune responses to AMD pathology and providing a surrogate marker for inflammation and drusen-related processes (fisher2022humanipscand pages 15-15, armento2025theamdassociatedgenetic pages 3-4).

Likewise, detection of inflammasome-associated cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 is performed by biochemical methods like ELISA. These assays capture the levels of cytokines secreted upon inflammasome activation and help in delineating the inflammatory cascade that contributes to disease progression in AMD (ebeling2022inflammasomeactivationin pages 17-18).

Mitochondrial respiration assays, typically using platforms like the Seahorse XFe analyzer and the Cell Mito Stress Test, provide quantitative measures of basal respiration, maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity, and ATP production. These assays are crucial for assessing mitochondrial bioenergetics and are especially relevant in RPE cells that exhibit compromised mitochondrial function in AMD (ebeling2022testingmitochondrialtargeteddrugs pages 1-2, ebeling2021impairedmitochondrialfunction pages 14-15).

Finally, phagocytosis assays assess the functionality of RPE cells in engulfing photoreceptor outer segments, which is a vital process for maintaining retinal homeostasis. These assays often use fluorescently labeled substrates (e.g., FITC-labeled bovine outer segments) and subsequent analysis via flow cytometry or high-content imaging platforms to quantify uptake efficiency, offering an important functional readout for therapeutic modulation studies (ebeling2022testingmitochondrialtargeteddrugs pages 12-14, fisher2022humanipscand pages 1-2).

Each of these assays is adaptable to scalable, high-throughput formats, making them suitable for both mechanistic studies and drug screening in well‐characterized RPE culture models derived from human sources, and they collectively offer a comprehensive toolkit for evaluating therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating dry AMD phenotypes.
