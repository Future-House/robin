Query: What are the major molecular mechanisms underlying retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction and drusen formation in dry age-related macular degeneration, including oxidative stress pathways, chronic complement activation, lipid and cholesterol dysregulation, mitochondrial impairment, autophagy deficiency, inflammasome signaling, and how these processes interplay to drive geographic atrophy in patients and animal models?

Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction and drusen formation in dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) are driven by a complex interplay of several interrelated molecular mechanisms. Central to these mechanisms is oxidative stress, which results from an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the cell’s antioxidant defenses. High metabolic demands, exposure to intense light and oxygen, and the abundance of peroxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids in photoreceptor outer segments lead to ROS overproduction. These radicals cause lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and DNA damage, which in turn impair RPE function and compromise its ability to sustain photoreceptor health (abokyi2021antioxidativeroleof pages 209-212, chen2023oxidativestressin pages 1-1).

Oxidative damage is further exacerbated by mitochondrial dysfunction, as mitochondria are both the primary source and a vulnerable target of ROS. Mitochondrial impairment results in deficient energy production and an increased generation of ROS, thereby amplifying oxidative damage in RPE cells. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle where oxidative stress further deteriorates mitochondrial function, contributing to both RPE cell loss and the accumulation of cellular debris (bilbaomalave2021mitochondrialdysfunctionand pages 1-2, iliescu2024nonneovascularagerelatedmacular pages 1-2).

Chronic complement activation is another pivotal mechanism in dry AMD pathogenesis. Dysregulation of the complement system—particularly involving genetic variants such as those in complement factor H (CFH)—leads to uncontrolled complement activity and deposition of complement components within drusen. These complement proteins not only serve as markers of local inflammation but also actively contribute to RPE cell injury through the formation of membrane attack complexes, thereby promoting chronic inflammatory cascades that damage the retina (abokyi2021antioxidativeroleof pages 32-37, borchert2023theroleof pages 3-5).

Lipid and cholesterol dysregulation plays a complementary role, with the aberrant accumulation of oxidized lipids and apolipoproteins contributing significantly to drusen biogenesis. The buildup of lipid-rich deposits beneath the RPE and within Bruch’s membrane creates a physical and biochemical barrier that impairs nutrient and waste exchange, thereby exacerbating oxidative and inflammatory stress within the retina. Genetic variants in lipid metabolism-related genes further predispose individuals to these dysregulated processes (basyal2024antioxidantsandmechanistic pages 4-5, brodzka2024immunogeneticandenvironmental pages 4-5).

Deficiencies in autophagy, the lysosomal-mediated degradation pathway responsible for clearing damaged proteins and organelles, add another layer of complexity. When autophagy is impaired, RPE cells are unable to remove oxidatively damaged components efficiently, leading to the accumulation of toxic aggregates and lipofuscin—a nondegradable byproduct that further impedes lysosomal function. This reduced cellular clearance contributes to the formation of drusen and exacerbates RPE degeneration (abokyi2021antioxidativeroleof pages 209-212, basyal2024antioxidantsandmechanistic pages 5-7).

Inflammasome signaling, particularly via the NLRP3 inflammasome, integrates many aspects of oxidative damage and complement activation into a final proinflammatory response. Activation of the inflammasome leads to the production of interleukins such as IL-1β and IL-18, which promote inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) and further amplify the inflammatory milieu within the RPE. This chronic inflammatory state accelerates RPE atrophy and thereby drives progression toward geographic atrophy (borchert2023theroleof pages 5-6, gallenga2023determinationofthe pages 42-46).

Overall, the interconnection among these pathways creates a vicious cycle that progressively impairs RPE function. Oxidative stress damages cellular components and mitochondria, which then exacerbates ROS production; simultaneously, complement dysregulation and lipid accumulation initiate and sustain chronic inflammation. Autophagy deficiency compounds the problem by preventing the proper clearance of damaged materials, while inflammasome activation converts these insults into a sustained inflammatory response. Together, these mechanisms underpin both RPE degeneration and drusen deposition, ultimately leading to geographic atrophy as observed in both patient studies and animal models (hernandez2025roleofoxidative pages 8-10, iliescu2024nonneovascularagerelatedmacular pages 1-2).
