The current evidence outlines a comprehensive preclinical strategy aimed at addressing dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) through complement pathway modulation. Although no registered clinical trials have yet combined all these elements, the preclinical rationale is robust.

Researchers employ high‐throughput screening (HTS) of diverse chemical libraries using retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell models to identify novel small molecule inhibitors that target key complement proteins. In dry AMD, dysregulation of the complement cascade—including components such as complement factor H (CFH), C3, C5, complement factor B (CFB), and activation fragments like C5a and iC3b—is closely associated with chronic inflammation and drusen accumulation. Drusen, the extracellular deposits characteristic of dry AMD, serve as both a marker and mediator of disease progression, and their reduction is one critical endpoint for achieving disease modification (Clinical Trials Search: dry age-related macular degeneration AND complement pathway modulation AND high-throughput screening AND chemical library AND retinal pigment epithelial cells AND small molecule inhibitors AND target engagement AND CFH AND C3 AND drusen AND efficacy AND mechanism AND cell viability AND C5 AND CFB AND C5a AND iC3b).

Once HTS identifies candidate inhibitors, target engagement assays are conducted to confirm that these compounds interact directly with the intended molecular targets, such as CFH and C3. These assays typically involve binding affinity measurements or competition formats to demonstrate that the small molecules effectively disrupt complement activation processes. Mechanism confirmation then follows, where functional assays assess the ability of the inhibitors to block critical cleavage events (for instance, preventing the conversion of C3 into C3a and C3b) and counteract downstream inflammatory signaling associated with drusen formation (marchesi2024differenttherapeuticapproaches pages 15-16, luu2024…approachto pages 24-28).

An essential element of this screening paradigm is ensuring that these potential therapeutics do not compromise RPE cell viability. Cell viability assays are integral to the workflow to guarantee that while complement overactivation is being inhibited, the fundamental cellular functions and survival of RPE cells are preserved. This balance is crucial because excessive cytotoxicity would negate the benefits of complement inhibition, especially in the context of a disease driven by chronic degenerative changes (koirala2018molecularresponseof pages 54-57, marchesi2024differenttherapeuticapproaches pages 20-22).

Furthermore, preclinical animal models—such as those that mimic stress-induced retinal degeneration through altered lipid metabolism or genetic modifications—have been used to demonstrate that effective inhibition of complement activation can lead to reduced drusen formation and improved retinal structure. Thus, while clinical evidence remains limited and translational gaps persist, the data suggest that small molecule inhibitors could stabilize or even improve retinal function if they can successfully engage and modulate complementary targets such as C5, CFB, and C5a in addition to CFH and C3 (marchesi2024differenttherapeuticapproaches pages 16-17, marchesi2024differenttherapeuticapproaches pages 23-25).

In summary, despite the absence of registered clinical trials that integrate HTS of diverse chemical libraries, target engagement assays, detailed mechanism-of-action confirmation, and cell viability assessments specifically for complement modulation in dry AMD, the preclinical research provides a clear framework and rationale. Future studies urgently need to translate these findings into clinical settings by carefully balancing efficacy—through reduction of drusen and modulation of complement components like CFH, C3, C5, CFB, C5a, and iC3b—with the maintenance of RPE cell health (Clinical Trials Search: dry age-related macular degeneration AND complement pathway modulation AND high-throughput screening AND chemical library AND retinal pigment epithelial cells AND small molecule inhibitors AND target engagement AND CFH AND C3 AND drusen AND efficacy AND mechanism AND cell viability AND C5 AND CFB AND C5a AND iC3b, marchesi2024differenttherapeuticapproaches pages 30-30).
