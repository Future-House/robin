Query: drug repurposing OR diverse chemical library screening AND complement activation assay AND retinal pigment epithelial cell models AND high-content imaging AND target validation AND mechanistic specificity AND dry AMD AND preclinical efficacy AND hit-to-lead optimization AND assay development AND structure-activity relationships

The available evidence indicates that an integrated drug discovery pipeline encompassing drug repurposing or diverse chemical library screening, complement activation assays, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell models, high-content imaging, target validation, mechanistic specificity, preclinical efficacy, hit-to-lead optimization, assay development, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) analyses in the context of dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD) remains largely uncharted territory in registered clinical trial repositories.

In this context, “drug repurposing” refers to the application of existing drugs for novel therapeutic indications, while “diverse chemical library screening” involves systematically testing a wide range of chemical compounds to identify potential new leads. A “complement activation assay” is typically employed to measure the activation status of the complement system—an immune pathway that has been genetically and clinically implicated in dry AMD pathogenesis. High-content imaging is an advanced automated microscopy technique that enables phenotypic evaluation of cellular responses, and retinal pigment epithelial cell models provide a physiologically relevant system for ocular disease studies. “Target validation” and “mechanistic specificity” are critical for confirming that the chosen complement components (such as C3, CFH, or CFD) are central players in dry AMD and that modulation of these targets produces the desired cellular and clinical outcomes.

Despite the robustness of genetic and clinical rationale linking complement activation to dry AMD—with complement C3, CFH, CFHR5, CFI, CFD, C9, and C5 being highlighted—it is evident from the ClinicalTrials.gov queries that no clinical trials currently address this comprehensive, integrative approach. Reports indicate that no studies have registered efforts which combine drug repurposing or chemical library screening with complementary assays that utilize high-content imaging in RPE cell models. In practice, while drug development pipelines targeting the complement cascade (e.g., PEGCETACOPLAN, a C3 inhibitor, and LAMPALIZUMAB targeting CFD) have reached clinical evaluation stages for other endpoints, they do not incorporate the detailed preclinical methodologies described here—such as nuanced assay development and subsequent hit-to-lead optimization pipelines.

The Open Targets Platform provides extensive genetic evidence supporting the involvement of complement components in dry AMD. This data underlines that targets such as C3 and CFH exhibit strong associations, thereby validating their relevance in the disease mechanism. Moreover, the clinical development status of complementary inhibitors like PEGCETACOPLAN suggests that while therapeutic evaluation of complement activation is pursued, the coupling of these efforts with advanced phenotypic screening using high-content imaging in RPE cells—with subsequent SAR analysis and preclinical efficacy assessments—has not been documented in registered clinical trials.

The absence of clinical trial records incorporating these integrated preclinical screening and development strategies implies that these approaches either remain in the experimental stages or that the documentation of such efforts is not yet reflected in publicly available databases. As a result, while there is a solid foundation of target validation based on genetic, mechanistic, and even some clinical trial data regarding complement activation in dry AMD, there is a notable gap in establishing a pipeline that systematically ties together drug repurposing or chemical library screening with high-content imaging–based assays in RPE models, followed by hit-to-lead optimization and SAR studies. (Clinical Trials Search: dry AMD AND complement activation AND drug repurposing OR chemical library AND high-content imaging AND retinal pigment epithelium, OpenTargets Search: dry AMD-complement activation)

In summary, despite the promising avenues outlined by preclinical and genetic data, integrated approaches linking assay development from phenotypic screening through to lead optimization in RPE cells for targeting complement activation in dry AMD have not yet transitioned into the clinical trial stage. This presents an opportunity for further research to bridge this translational gap using state-of-the-art imaging and screening technologies that encompass all aspects from target validation to SAR analysis.
