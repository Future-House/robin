RPE cells are central to dry AMD pathogenesis as they integrate a cascade of dysregulated processes that converge to promote cellular degeneration. These cells normally maintain retinal homeostasis; however, aging and environmental insults trigger mitochondrial dysfunction. Specifically, mitochondrial damage leads to reduced ATP production and excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), establishing a state of chronic oxidative stress that inflicts damage on mitochondrial DNA and other cellular components (basyal2024antioxidantsandmechanistic pages 4-5, kim2021molecularmechanismsof pages 6-7).

In parallel, complement activation is strongly implicated in dry AMD. Genetic variants such as those in CFH compromise the function of complement regulators, leading to excessive activation of the complement cascade. Complement fragments, in turn, exacerbate the oxidative burden and interact with RPE cells, thereby contributing to inflammation and further injury (armento2021thecomplementsystem pages 10-11, malih2023choroidalmastcells pages 2-3).

This interplay between oxidative stress and complement dysregulation sets the stage for inflammasome activation. In RPE cells, the NLRP3 inflammasome is primed by oxidative stress, complement factors, and lysosomal destabilization. The subsequent activation of caspase-1 leads to the maturation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, creating a feed-forward loop of inflammation that accentuates cellular damage and promotes pyroptotic cell death (chen2022spotlightonpyroptosis pages 9-12, korhonen2024inflammasomeactivationin pages 82-84).

Concurrently, the degradation systems of the RPE become compromised. Autophagy, which normally clears damaged proteins and organelles, becomes impaired with age. This impairment results in the accumulation of toxic aggregates such as lipofuscin and drusen components that further disrupt lysosomal function. The decline in autophagic clearance not only reinforces oxidative stress but also contributes to lysosomal dysfunction, which is a critical trigger of inflammasome activation and subsequent inflammatory signaling (kaarniranta2023autophagyinagerelated pages 1-2, buonfiglio2024recentadvancesin pages 9-10).

The culmination of these events—mitochondrial dysfunction, unchecked oxidative stress, complement dysregulation, impaired autophagy, lysosomal failure, and inflammasome-mediated cytokine release—initiates multiple RPE cell death pathways. Evidence supports the involvement of apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis in the loss of RPE cells. As these programmed cell death processes drive the degeneration of RPE cells, they severely disrupt the RPE barrier integrity that is vital for photoreceptor support and overall retinal homeostasis (kim2021molecularmechanismsof pages 14-15, pinelli2020areappraisalof pages 15-17).

Finally, the sustained release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and others perpetuates chronic local inflammation. This inflammatory milieu further undermines RPE cellular function and contributes to the progressive breakdown of the outer blood–retina barrier, effectively setting the stage for photoreceptor loss and eventual vision impairment characteristic of dry AMD (hernandez2025roleofoxidative pages 8-10, buonfiglio2024recentadvancesin pages 12-14).

In summary, the interplay between complement activation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, inflammasome activation, autophagy impairment, lysosomal dysfunction, and inflammatory cytokine release collectively drives multiple cell death pathways. This convergence ultimately erodes RPE barrier integrity and paves the way for the degenerative cascade observed in dry AMD (korhonen2024inflammasomeactivationin pages 79-82, kim2021molecularmechanismsof pages 14-15).
