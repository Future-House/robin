Query: dry age-related macular degeneration AND alternative complement pathway activation AND retinal pigment epithelial cell damage AND inflammation AND drusen formation AND genetic risk factors AND CFH polymorphisms AND C3 activation fragments AND membrane attack complex deposition AND local complement dysregulation

The pathogenesis of dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) is driven by a multifactorial cascade centered on dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway. Under normal conditions, this pathway operates at low-level “tickover” and is tightly controlled by regulatory proteins, most notably complement factor H (CFH). However, genetic risk factors, such as CFH polymorphisms—exemplified by the Y402H variant—impair CFH’s binding affinity for glycosaminoglycans in Bruch’s membrane. This impaired regulation leads to excessive activation of the alternative pathway, resulting in increased formation of C3 convertase and downstream C3 activation fragments (C3a and C3b) (allingham2021immunologicalaspectsof pages 90-91, armento2021thecomplementsystem pages 7-8).

Excessive C3 activation contributes directly to retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell damage. RPE cells, which are critical for photoreceptor support and overall retinal homeostasis, become vulnerable when subjected to high local concentrations of C3 fragments and other complement activation products. Moreover, the unchecked activation of the complement cascade culminates in the assembly and deposition of the membrane attack complex (MAC) on RPE cell membranes. MAC deposition can induce sublytic stress or direct cytotoxicity, leading to RPE dysfunction and ultimately cell death (clark2018theeyeas pages 2-4, cox2023functionalassessmentof pages 56-60).

The injured RPE cells release damage-associated signals that initiate and sustain a chronic inflammatory response. The complement activation fragments themselves, particularly C3a, act as potent anaphylatoxins, recruiting immune cells such as macrophages, microglia, and other inflammatory mediators to the retinal tissue. This local inflammatory milieu exacerbates damage through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, thereby perpetuating the cycle of complement activation and cellular injury (armento2021thecomplementsystem pages 1-2, chakuroff2018theeffectof pages 13-19).

Simultaneously, these molecular events promote the formation of drusen, which are extracellular deposits located between the basal lamina of the RPE and Bruch’s membrane. Drusen contain a mixture of lipids, proteins, and notably, complement components including C3 fragments and MAC. Their presence not only serves as a hallmark of early AMD but also reinforces local complement dysregulation and chronic inflammation. As drusen accumulate, they further disrupt nutrient transport and waste clearance, aggravating RPE stress and leading to progressive retinal degeneration (allingham2021immunologicalaspectsof pages 175-177, cao2016theroleof pages 27-31).

The genetic predisposition conferred by CFH polymorphisms thus plays a critical role by undermining the complement regulatory mechanisms. These genetic variants reduce the inhibitory efficiency of CFH, thereby heightening the risk of complement overactivation. When combined with age-related extracellular matrix alterations in Bruch’s membrane, the resulting microenvironment is highly conducive to persistent complement activation, local inflammation, and RPE cell death (armento2021thecomplementsystem pages 8-10, buonfiglio2024recentadvancesin pages 14-15).

In summary, dry AMD develops as an outcome of local complement dysregulation triggered by genetic risk factors such as CFH polymorphisms. This dysregulation fuels an excessive production of C3 activation fragments and the deposition of MAC on RPE cells, which in turn leads to RPE damage and an inflammatory cascade. The ensuing chronic inflammation and impaired RPE function drive drusen formation, thereby exacerbating the progression of dry AMD (borooah2016developingapatientderived pages 40-43, edwards2021bruch’smembraneand pages 175-177).
