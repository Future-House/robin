Answer:
Assay Overview:
This assay involves quantifying the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) culture supernatants using ELISA. It models a key aspect of dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) pathogenesis by capturing dysregulated complement activation—a process implicated in chronic inflammation and RPE injury. The approach is designed to measure the levels of bioactive complement fragments (C3a and C5a) that are generated when the complement system is activated. Cultured RPE cells, which can be either established cell lines such as ARPE-19 or more physiologically relevant iPSC-derived RPE models, serve as the biological material. The measurement via ELISA provides a quantitative readout of local complement activity in vitro (altay2019earlylocalactivation pages 4-5, brandstetter2015complementcomponentc5a pages 1-2).

Biomedical Evidence:
Complement dysregulation is central to the pathogenesis of dry AMD. Clinical and genetic data implicate complement activation in disease progression—elevated C3a levels have been observed in early and intermediate AMD, and C5a has been shown to prime RPE cells for inflammasome activation under photooxidative stress. These findings are supported by mechanistic studies demonstrating that complement activation not only promotes recruitment of inflammatory cells but also drives local inflammatory signaling that can exacerbate RPE injury and deposit formation at the RPE–Bruch’s membrane interface. Furthermore, evidence from proteomic and genetic studies highlights the significance of complement proteins and regulators (e.g., CFH, CFB) in AMD lesions and drusen, underscoring the relevance of targeting complement dysregulation therapeutically (altay2019earlylocalactivation pages 4-5, brandstetter2015complementcomponentc5a pages 1-2, gemenetzi2016complementpathwaybiomarkers pages 1-2, wilke2024complementregulationin pages 3-5).

Previous Use:
Several studies have previously employed ELISA-based assays to quantify complement activation products in both clinical samples and in vitro models. For example, the measurement of C3a in the aqueous humour of patients has provided insights into early complement activation in AMD (altay2019earlylocalactivation pages 4-5). Similarly, in vitro studies using RPE cell models have used ELISA to detect changes in C3a and C5a levels following oxidative or stress-inducing stimuli, thereby linking complement activation to downstream inflammatory events such as NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion (brandstetter2015complementcomponentc5a pages 2-3, fernandezgodino2018c3atriggersformation pages 1-2). These applications underscore the assay’s utility for monitoring the impact of therapeutic candidates aimed at modulating the complement cascade.

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths:
• The assay offers high specificity and sensitivity due to the robust ELISA platform, providing a quantitative and reproducible measure of biologically active complement fragments.
• It is directly linked to the underlying pathophysiology of dry AMD, where local complement activation plays a pivotal role in RPE damage and chronic inflammation.
• The approach is scalable and adaptable for high-throughput screening, making it suitable for early-stage drug discovery pipelines focused on complement modulation (schikora2025maturationdependentcomplementproduction pages 1-6, wilke2024complementregulationin pages 3-5).

Weaknesses:
• In vitro RPE models may not fully recapitulate the complex retinal microenvironment found in vivo, such as cell–cell interactions and systemic influences that modulate complement activity.
• Variability in complement component expression linked to differences in RPE cell maturity or culture conditions may impact assay reproducibility and the sensitivity of detecting therapeutic effects (schikora2025maturationdependentcomplementproduction pages 32-35, chirco2018creactiveproteinas pages 1-2).
• The measured levels of C3a and C5a reflect only a part of the broader complement cascade; thus, complementary assays might be necessary to capture full spectrum of complement regulation.

In summary, ELISA-based quantification of C3a and C5a in RPE culture supernatants is a scientifically compelling and methodologically robust assay for testing therapeutics aimed at modulating complement activation in dry AMD. Its strengths in sensitivity, specificity, and direct mechanistic relevance warrant its inclusion in early-stage drug discovery efforts, provided that limitations regarding in vitro model complexity and assay variability are addressed through rigorous optimization and validation (altay2019earlylocalactivation pages 4-5, brandstetter2015complementcomponentc5a pages 1-2, gemenetzi2016complementpathwaybiomarkers pages 1-2).
