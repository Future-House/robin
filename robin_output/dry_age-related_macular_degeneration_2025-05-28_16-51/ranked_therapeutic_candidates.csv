Below is a comprehensive literature review evaluating avacincaptad pegol (Zimura) as a therapeutic candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), with particular focus on its role in slowing the progression of geographic atrophy (GA). The review is organized into five primary sections: an overview of the therapeutic candidate, a review of its therapeutic history, a detailed discussion of its mechanism of action, a description of its expected effects, and an overall evaluation of its potential in treating dry AMD.

• Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Avacincaptad pegol, marketed under the trade name Zimura, is a synthetically generated RNA aptamer designed with high binding specificity to complement component C5. This drug candidate is produced by Iveric Bio, an Astellas company, and has been optimized via PEGylation—a process in which a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety is attached to the aptamer. This modification significantly enhances drug stability and prolongs the half‐life of the molecule in the ocular milieu following intravitreal administration. Because intravitreal injection allows the agent to bypass the blood–retinal barrier and achieve high local concentrations in the posterior segment of the eye, this targeted delivery route ensures that avacincaptad pegol can effectively engage its intended target in the retina over extended intervals (Kang, 2023; Danzig et al., 2024). As an RNA aptamer, this agent belongs to a class of nucleic acid–based therapeutics that are known for their capacity to bind specific proteins with high affinity and precision. In contrast to antibody‐based drugs, RNA aptamers offer advantages such as lower immunogenicity and more reproducible synthetic pathways. The target of avacincaptad pegol is complement C5—a key component of the terminal complement cascade. Complement C5 is critical because its activation leads to the generation of two potent effectors, C5a and C5b. Whereas C5a is a strong anaphylatoxin that triggers inflammatory responses, C5b initiates the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which can directly mediate cell lysis (Danzig et al., 2024). This candidate has emerged as a representative of a specialized class of complement inhibitors that are being explored for several inflammatory conditions, with the potential to prevent downstream tissue damage by modulating overactive immune pathways. Given the established importance of complement overactivation in dry AMD and GA, avacincaptad pegol’s molecular design makes it an attractive candidate for managing a disease state that has hitherto been largely untreatable (Tzoumas et al., 2023).

• Therapeutic History
The development of avacincaptad pegol is grounded in a longstanding recognition that dysregulated complement activation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of dry AMD and associated geographic atrophy. Before the advent of targeted complement inhibitors, therapeutic strategies for GA were mostly limited to antioxidant supplementation and supportive measures, with few options capable of altering the disease trajectory. Early biochemical studies and genetic analyses demonstrated that variations in complement regulatory proteins, such as Factor H, are linked to increased susceptibility to AMD. This spurred a series of research initiatives aimed at modulating the complement cascade, ultimately resulting in the design of agents that can selectively inhibit critical components within the pathway (Dascalu et al., 2024).

Clinical evaluation of avacincaptad pegol began with Phase II trials such as NCT02686658, which investigated various dosing regimens in patients with non-foveal GA due to dry AMD. These studies revealed that intravitreal injections of Zimura were generally well tolerated in an elderly population and provided initial evidence for its efficacy by slowing the rate of GA lesion enlargement (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Building upon these early findings, subsequent pivotal studies—most notably the GATHER1 and GATHER2 Phase II/III trials—demonstrated that treatment with avacincaptad pegol led to statistically significant reductions in GA progression. The reduction in lesion growth, consistently observed in these studies, ranged between approximately 25% and 30% relative to sham-treated cohorts (Danzig et al., 2024; Cruz‐Pimentel & Wu, 2023). In addition, combination studies conducted in participants with neovascular AMD (such as those in NCT03362190 and NCT03364153) have helped to reinforce the concept that targeting the complement system may have broader applications in retinal disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017; 2018). Together, these studies have solidified the scientific premise for using complement inhibition as a disease-modifying strategy in GA, ultimately resulting in regulatory approvals that now mark Zimura as one of the first approved agents for GA secondary to dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

• Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, avacincaptad pegol has been engineered to bind with high specificity and affinity to complement component C5. Under normal physiological conditions, C5 is cleaved by the C5 convertase enzyme into two subunits: C5a, a potent inflammatory mediator, and C5b, which serves as the initiating fragment for the assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The formation of MAC results in direct lysis of target cells and triggers additional inflammatory cascades. By preventing the cleavage of C5, avacincaptad pegol disrupts the production of C5a and the subsequent formation of MAC (Danzig et al., 2024).

One of the critical downstream consequences of blocking C5 cleavage is the mitigation of inflammasome activation in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. The NLRP3 inflammasome is an innate immune complex that can be primed by C5a, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of pyroptosis or inflammatory cell death. In RPE cells, chronic exposure to a pro-inflammatory milieu—exacerbated by aberrant complement activity—can result in impaired phagocytic and autophagic processes. These processes are essential for the regular clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) and cellular debris, which is vital for maintaining retinal homeostasis (Borchert et al., 2023; Ewing et al., 2022).

In addition to halting the production of inflammatory mediators, selective inhibition of C5 by avacincaptad pegol also preserves upstream complement functions. Downstream inhibition of C5 allows the retention of activity in earlier components such as C3, which have beneficial roles in immune defense and tissue repair. This selective inhibition strategy offers an important advantage over broader complement inhibitors (for example, agents targeting C3) because it limits the risk of compromising protective immune functions while still effectively reducing harmful inflammation (Tzoumas et al., 2023).

On a biochemical level, the binding of the aptamer to C5 is mediated by a conformation-dependent interaction that prevents enzymatic cleavage by C5 convertase. Structural studies—though not extensively detailed in the available clinical trial excerpts—suggest that this binding is of high affinity and exhibits a long residence time, which underpins the sustained inhibition of the downstream inflammatory cascade over the dosing interval provided by monthly intravitreal injections (Danzig et al., 2024). Preclinical models have further demonstrated that by obstructing the cleavage of C5, there is a marked reduction in MAC deposition on the RPE and adjacent choroidal tissues, thereby protecting these cells from cytolytic injury and the resultant cascade of inflammatory events (Ewing et al., 2022).

• Expected Effect
Given the detailed mechanism of action, it is expected that avacincaptad pegol will produce several interrelated therapeutic effects in patients with dry AMD affected by GA. These expected outcomes are based on both anatomical and functional considerations.

First, the inhibition of C5 cleavage is anticipated to lead to a significant reduction in GA lesion growth. Clinical trials such as GATHER1 and GATHER2 have already provided evidence that monthly doses of avacincaptad pegol administered intravitreally slow the progression of GA lesion enlargement by approximately 25–30% relative to sham-treated controls (Danzig et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Quantitative imaging modalities, including fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), have been used to assess lesion size and structural integrity. These imaging endpoints not only reflect the anatomical benefit of complement inhibition but are also correlated with the progression of visual functional decline, although improvements in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) may be modest due to the advanced nature of GA (Khanani et al., 2023).

Second, by reducing the levels of the inflammatory mediator C5a, avacincaptad pegol is expected to suppress the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in RPE cells. Inhibition of the inflammasome is crucial because its activation normally leads to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, which promote local retinal inflammation and contribute to pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death. The reduction in inflammasome activity is hypothesized to lead to better preservation of RPE cell health, thereby maintaining their essential phagocytic and autophagic functions. In a healthy retina, these processes are critical for the daily clearance of POS and for preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolic debris. Experimental models and biochemical studies support the notion that complement-mediated inflammation is a key driver of impaired phagocytosis and autophagy in the RPE (Borchert et al., 2023; Antonio-Aguirre & Arevalo, 2023).

Third, by sparing upstream complement components, the use of avacincaptad pegol is expected to maintain the beneficial roles of C3 and other early complement proteins in immune surveillance and neuroprotection. This selective inhibition minimizes the risk of rendering the ocular microenvironment immunosuppressed—a significant consideration in a tissue that relies on precise immune regulation to counter infections and support repair processes (Tzoumas et al., 2023).

Fourth, the overall anticipated effect is not only a retardation in GA progression but also a potential slowing of visual function decline. Although the primary efficacy endpoints in clinical trials have largely focused on anatomical progression as measured by lesion size, the preservation of RPE function and reduction in inflammatory stress may indirectly contribute to maintaining photoreceptor health and visual acuity. Functional assays, including low-luminance visual acuity and BCVA tests, are expected to show stabilization or a slower rate of decline over prolonged treatment durations. While the improvements in visual function may be less immediately dramatic than the anatomical changes, they represent a clinically meaningful benefit in a disease state that otherwise progresses inexorably toward blindness (Ong et al., 2024).

In experimental assay systems—including in vitro analyses of RPE phagocytic activity and in vivo imaging of GA lesion progression—avacincaptad pegol should demonstrate clear evidence of complement inhibition. The reduction in markers of inflammation, improved cellular morphology of RPE, and slower expansion of retinal atrophy are the anticipated direct readouts. Collectively, these effects should translate into a net benefit for patients by delaying the progression of GA and potentially preserving residual visual function for a longer period (Qin et al., 2024).

• Overall Evaluation
Avacincaptad pegol emerges as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD with geographic atrophy owing to its strong mechanistic rationale, targeted mode of action, and favorable clinical efficacy profiles demonstrated in multiple trials. Its design as a PEGylated RNA aptamer confers several advantages. First, its high specificity for complement C5 allows it to efficiently block the generation of C5a and the formation of the MAC. This selective inhibition is essential for reducing downstream inflammatory damage without broadly suppressing the entire complement cascade, thereby preserving the beneficial functions of early complement components (Danzig et al., 2024; Tzoumas et al., 2023).

The clinical history of Zimura is well supported by Phase II and III studies. Intravitreal injections of avacincaptad pegol have been shown to produce a robust reduction in GA lesion growth rates—effects that have been consistently noted across trials such as NCT02686658, GATHER1, and GATHER2. These studies have lent confidence to the potential for this agent to modify the course of a disease that previously had very few if any, therapeutic options. The reduction in lesion growth by approximately 25–30% clearly demonstrates an anatomical benefit that may have long-term implications for preserving vision, even if improvements in visual acuity are modest due to the advanced state of retinal degeneration in many patients (Khanani et al., 2023).

Mechanistically, the ability of avacincaptad pegol to mitigate inflammasome activation in the RPE is particularly compelling. Chronic activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a critical role in driving the inflammatory milieu that impairs RPE function. By reducing the concentration of C5a, the therapeutic can suppress this inflammatory cascade and help restore efficient phagocytosis and autophagy. In doing so, it addresses two core pathological instigators in GA: inflammation-induced RPE cell death and the accumulation of cellular debris that further impairs retinal function (Borchert et al., 2023; Ewing et al., 2022). The translational impact of these mechanistic effects is supported by clinical endpoints showing that slower GA progression corresponds with a potential stabilization of visual function over time.

From a pharmacological perspective, the intravitreal route of administration furnishes multiple benefits. It circumvents the blood–retinal barrier, enabling high local drug concentrations that are critical for effective target engagement in the posterior segment of the eye. Moreover, the localized delivery minimizes systemic drug exposure, thereby reducing the likelihood of systemic side effects. However, it is important to note that intravitreal injections inherently come with a risk of injection-related complications such as endophthalmitis; yet, the clinical data indicate that avacincaptad pegol has a safety profile comparable to that of other intravitreal procedures, with the frequency of serious adverse ocular events remaining acceptably low (Ewing et al., 2022; Kang, 2023).

Despite these strengths, there are potential weaknesses and challenges that must be acknowledged. One of the key concerns noted in the literature is the potential for an increased risk of macular neovascularization (MNV) or conversion to exudative AMD over time. Although clinical studies report this risk as relatively low and manageable with currently available anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapies, it remains a potential safety signal that warrants continued observation in both clinical trial settings and post-marketing surveillance (Tzoumas et al., 2023). Furthermore, as with many therapies that specifically target one part of the complement cascade, long-term inhibition of C5 may have unforeseen effects on local immune regulation. Given that complement proteins are involved in both deleterious inflammatory processes and protective immune surveillance, a delicate balance must be maintained. The selective inhibition provided by avacincaptad pegol is designed to strike this balance by leaving upstream components intact, but the long-term consequences of chronic complement blockade in the eye will require further investigation (Dascalu et al., 2024).

Another area that merits further research is the direct demonstration of restored phagocytic and autophagic competence in RPE cells. Although preclinical studies and mechanistic insights suggest that complement inhibition should improve cellular clearance functions, robust longitudinal clinical data correlating improved RPE function with sustained visual outcomes are needed. Biomarkers that accurately reflect phagocytic and autophagic activity in vivo remain an area of active investigation. Overcoming this knowledge gap will be important for establishing that the reduction in GA lesion growth indeed translates into meaningful improvements in cellular viability and, ultimately, visual performance (Antonio-Aguirre & Arevalo, 2023; Qin et al., 2024).

When comparing avacincaptad pegol to other agents within the same therapeutic landscape, its distinct advantage lies in its selective targeting of complement C5. Other drugs, such as pegcetacoplan, target upstream components like C3 and may be associated with broader suppression of the complement system, which can lead to a higher risk of unwanted immunosuppressive effects. The focused action of Zimura not only yields efficacy in slowing GA progression but does so with a better-preserved overall immune function, which is of particular importance in the ocular setting (Tzoumas et al., 2023; Ong et al., 2024).

Overall, the evidence available from a range of biochemical, preclinical, and clinical studies supports the hypothesis that intravitreal avacincaptad pegol will effectively block the generation of C5a and MAC, thereby suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the RPE. In doing so, it is expected to restore phagocytic and autophagic competence by alleviating chronic sub-RPE inflammation and lysosomal dysfunction. The cumulative data suggest that this agent is well positioned to slow the progression of GA—a major unmet need in dry AMD—and offers a novel mechanism-based approach that addresses not only the inflammatory symptoms but also the underlying cellular dysfunction that drives disease progression.

In summary, avacincaptad pegol’s aptamer-based design, high specificity for complement C5, and demonstrated clinical efficacy in reducing GA lesion progression make it a compelling therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its intravitreal administration ensures effective local drug delivery while minimizing systemic exposure. Although certain concerns remain—such as potential neovascular conversion and the need for further demonstration of restored RPE clearance functions—the balance of evidence strongly supports continued development and deployment of this therapeutic. With positive Phase II/III clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals already in place, avacincaptad pegol represents a major milestone in the management of geographic atrophy secondary to dry AMD, offering hope for a disease that has long been resistant to effective treatment (Khanani et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

As we move forward, ongoing and future studies should focus on longer-term safety data and functional outcome measures as well as identifying biomarkers that can provide real-time feedback on RPE cellular health. This will help ensure that the anatomical benefits observed translate into sustained improvements in visual function and quality of life for patients suffering from this degenerative disease. In light of the current evidence, avacincaptad pegol positions itself as a pioneering candidate in a new paradigm of ocular therapeutics that targets the underlying mechanisms of complement-mediated inflammation and cellular dysfunction in dry AMD (Ong et al., 2024; Tzoumas et al., 2023).

• Conclusion
In conclusion, a comprehensive review of the biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature indicates that avacincaptad pegol (Zimura) holds considerable potential as a treatment for dry age-related macular degeneration characterized by geographic atrophy. The agent’s design as a PEGylated RNA aptamer selectively targeting complement C5 enables it to block the generation of pro-inflammatory mediators, suppress inflammasome activation in the retinal pigment epithelium, and, importantly, preserve essential cellular processes such as phagocytosis and autophagy. These combined effects are anticipated to slow anatomical GA progression and potentially stabilize visual function. While questions remain regarding the long-term effects, particularly the risk of neovascular complications and the precise degree of functional recovery, the strengths of avacincaptad pegol—namely its high specificity, clinical efficacy evidenced by robust reductions in GA lesion growth, and acceptable safety profile—underscore its promise as a disease-modifying therapy in a field that has until recently lacked effective interventions. Continued research, long-term studies, and post-marketing surveillance will be vital to refining its risk–benefit profile and confirming its role in the management of dry AMD. Given the current evidence from preclinical models, Phase II/III clinical trials, and regulatory approvals, the development of avacincaptad pegol represents a significant and encouraging advance in ocular therapeutics with the potential to meaningfully alter the course of a debilitating disease (Danzig et al., 2024; Qin et al., 2024).

Overall, avacincaptad pegol is a highly promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic for dry AMD. Its mechanism of blocking C5 not only reduces the deleterious downstream effects of complement overactivation—including the generation of C5a and MAC formation—but also supports the restoration of crucial cellular processes in the RPE. These attributes, combined with the positive clinical data demonstrating slowed GA progression and a manageable safety profile, strongly support the continued investment in and development of this agent for a patient population with substantial unmet needs.

Avacincaptad pegol (Zimura),"Proposal for Avacincaptad pegol (Zimura)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Avacincaptad pegol (marketed as Zimura, and also known as IZERVAY) is a pegylated RNA aptamer developed through advanced nucleic acid selection methods such as SELEX. It was synthesized using biochemical techniques that yield nuclease‐resistant oligonucleotides with modifications—specifically 2′-fluoropyrimidines—and further enhanced via PEGylation to improve its pharmacokinetic profile and intraocular retention (Drolet et al., 2016; Moreira, 2022). As an aptamer, it belongs to a class of therapeutics that are synthetic ligands, typically having high affinity and specificity for their molecular targets. This drug class has been utilized previously in different therapeutic settings; for instance, Macugen was the first approved aptamer for ocular use, targeting VEGF, which paved the way for aptamers in retinal indications (Bege et al., 2025). Avacincaptad pegol represents a natural evolution of this concept but is specifically engineered to bind and inhibit complement component 5 (C5), a critical protein in the terminal complement cascade implicated in inflammatory processes and cell lysis in retinal tissue.

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic candidate stands on a robust foundation of preclinical and clinical research in complement modulation for retinal diseases. Early biochemical and preclinical studies identified dysregulation in the complement cascade as key to the pathogenesis of dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) and geographic atrophy (GA) (Armento et al., 2021; Nebbioso et al., 2019). Prior clinical trials, including Phase 2/3 studies such as those registered under NCT02686658 and NCT04435366, have evaluated Zimura in patients with GA secondary to dry AMD. In these studies, avacincaptad pegol was administered via intravitreal injection—with dosing schedules typically monthly—demonstrating statistically significant reductions in GA lesion growth and a favorable safety and tolerability profile (Khanani et al., 2023; Guimarães et al., 2022). Complement inhibition as a strategy in AMD has also been explored using agents targeting upstream components such as C3; however, Zimura’s focus on C5 provides a more specific blockade of the terminal inflammatory pathways, building on earlier experiences with monoclonal antibodies like eculizumab in systemic diseases, albeit with the need for localized ocular delivery to circumvent systemic adverse effects (Qin et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2022). Consequently, its clinical development history reflects both the promise and the challenges of introducing complement modulators into the AMD treatment arena.

Mechanism of Action:
Avacincaptad pegol exerts its pharmacological effect by specifically binding to complement component C5 with high affinity (with a dissociation constant in the picomolar range), thereby preventing its proteolytic cleavage into the pro‐inflammatory fragments C5a and C5b (Drolet et al., 2016; Qin et al., 2021). In the context of dry AMD, the cleavage of C5 leads to formation of C5a—a potent chemotactic and inflammatory mediator—and C5b, which participates in assembling the membrane attack complex (MAC). The MAC is responsible for pore formation and lysis of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and other retinal structures, thereby contributing to tissue injury and degeneration (Armento et al., 2021). By inhibiting C5 activation, avacincaptad pegol effectively halts the cascade downstream of C5, reducing the accumulation of inflammatory mediators and preventing MAC formation (Guimarães et al., 2022; Patel et al., 2022). It is this precise molecular interaction—a blockade of the terminal complement pathway—that is hypothesized to attenuate local inflammation at the subretinal interface and support the phagocytic function of RPE cells in clearing photoreceptor outer segments (Moreira, 2022).

Expected Effect:
Based on its molecular mechanism, avacincaptad pegol is expected to result in preservation of the retinal pigment epithelium and reduce the rate of geographic atrophy progression in patients with dry AMD. Specifically, by preventing the cleavage of C5 and subsequent MAC formation, the drug aims to mitigate complement-mediated cytotoxicity and inflammation. This should lead to decreased RPE cell death and a reduction in the accumulation of degenerative lesions in the retina (Khanani et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024). Moreover, preclinical models using C5-deficient mice have demonstrated maintained RPE morphology and consistent phagocytic receptor expression on RPE cells, suggesting that inhibiting C5 activity can preserve the critical function of photoreceptor outer segment clearance by RPE (Armento et al., 2021; Nebbioso et al., 2019). The high in vivo stability conferred by PEGylation allows for sustained intraocular concentrations, thereby ensuring prolonged target engagement and therapeutic effect. Thus, in the clinical setting, it is anticipated that patients treated with avacincaptad pegol will show a statistically significant slowing in the enlargement of GA lesions—a surrogate marker for disease progression—even if improvements in best-corrected visual acuity are modest or delayed (Khanani et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Avacincaptad pegol represents a promising targeted complement modulator for the treatment of dry AMD, particularly in its advanced form manifesting as geographic atrophy. One of its major strengths lies in its mechanism of action; by specifically binding to and inhibiting C5, it addresses a crucial pathological axis implicated in AMD progression without completely disrupting the overall complement cascade (Patel et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2021). The high affinity and pegylated structure of the aptamer also provide extended intraocular retention, thereby potentially reducing the frequency of injections required to maintain therapeutic levels—a definite benefit from both practical and patient compliance standpoints (Moreira, 2022; Bege et al., 2025).

Clinically, data emerging from phase 2/3 trials such as those documented under NCT02686658 and NCT04435366 have demonstrated that avacincaptad pegol slows GA lesion progression, which has been one of the most challenging aspects of dry AMD treatment. The safety and tolerability profiles reported to date are favorable, with manageable rates of adverse events predominantly related to the injection procedure itself rather than the pharmacologic action of the drug (Khanani et al., 2023; Guimarães et al., 2022). Furthermore, the mechanistic rationale is solidly supported by genetic studies that have implicated complement dysregulation in the development and progression of dry AMD, particularly in the terminal pathway involving C5 and its cleavage products (Armento et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2022).

However, some weaknesses and challenges remain. One concern is the potential risk for an increased incidence of macular neovascularization (CNV), which has been noted in some clinical studies. Although the rates are low and manageable, this risk could necessitate additional monitoring or even combination therapy with anti-VEGF agents in certain cases (Khanani et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024). Additionally, despite its promising effect on anatomical markers such as GA lesion size, the translation of these structural benefits into meaningful improvements in visual function has yet to be definitively demonstrated, a challenge that is common among therapies targeting chronic degenerative diseases where functional recovery lags behind structural preservation (Lai et al., 2024; Sharma, n.d.).

Another consideration is the rate of intravitreal injection required, which, while mitigated somewhat by the drug’s extended intraocular retention, still poses a treatment burden for elderly patients who are most affected by dry AMD. Continued efforts to optimize dosing regimens and investigate sustained-release delivery systems could potentially enhance the practicality and patient acceptance of this therapeutic approach (Fujii et al., 2025; Nebbioso et al., 2019).

Overall, avacincaptad pegol’s targeted inhibition of complement C5 represents a significant advancement in the search for effective disease-modifying treatments for dry AMD. Its development is well grounded in both mechanistic rationale and supportive clinical data, positioning it as one of the most promising candidates in a field that has long suffered from a paucity of effective interventions. With continued clinical evaluation and potential refinement of dosing and delivery, avacincaptad pegol could offer a viable therapeutic option to slow the progression of geographic atrophy, preserve retinal structure, and ultimately maintain visual function in a patient population with limited alternatives (Khanani et al., 2023; Patel et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2024).

Risuteganib (Luminate),"Proposal for Risuteganib (Luminate)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Risuteganib (also known as Luminate or RST-001) is a repurposed anti-integrin peptide originally derived from peptide sequences found in disintegrins, which are naturally occurring proteins typically sourced from snake venom. Its molecular design involves an engineered peptide that selectively interacts with specific integrins, most notably integrin αvβ5, a receptor that plays a critical role in the adhesion and phagocytic functions of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. This therapeutic candidate is classified as a repurposed peptide drug belonging to the broader class of anti-integrin agents. In general, anti-integrin peptides have been developed to target integrin-mediated cell adhesion and signaling pathways; they have shown efficacy in diverse applications ranging from oncology and inflammation to ocular diseases, where modulation of integrins can impact angiogenesis and inflammatory cell recruitment (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Gonzalez-Salinas et al., 2018). The synthesis of Risuteganib involves chemical peptide synthesis methods that enable precise control over its amino acid sequence and conformation, ensuring high specificity toward its integrin target without broadly inhibiting cell adhesion across unrelated cellular processes. Its repurposed nature is evidenced by the fact that its mechanism of action – selective integrin modulation – has been validated in preclinical assays, and early phase clinical trials have established a favorable safety profile for intravitreal administration in ocular indications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cammalleri et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
Anti-integrin therapies in ocular applications have a precedent in diseases such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and various vitreoretinal interface disorders. Risuteganib has been investigated extensively in a series of clinical trials, including Phase 2 trials designed to evaluate its safety and exploratory efficacy in non-exudative (dry) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) as well as in DME, where its administration via intravitreal injection was shown to be well tolerated (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014). Although early applications of anti-integrin peptides were often explored in oncology and inflammatory conditions, the mechanistic rationale for their use in dry AMD stems from extensive biochemical and preclinical studies demonstrating that timely integrin modulation in the retina – particularly by targeting integrin αvβ5 – can improve RPE cellular function. In preclinical in vitro studies using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE assays, Risuteganib treatment was associated with increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and enhanced internalization of photoreceptor outer segments (POS), indicating improved phagocytic activity (Cammalleri et al., 2019). These studies, along with early phase clinical data showing improvements in retinal sensitivity and a reduction in drusen volume in patients with dry AMD, suggest that Risuteganib has a promising therapeutic history when considered for AMD or similar retinal degenerations (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Previous clinical evidence also indicates that anti-integrin peptides, derived either directly from disintegrins or designed as synthetic mimetics, have been used safely in ocular applications, with studies demonstrating minimal intraocular inflammation and absence of retinal toxicity in long-term follow-up (Gonzalez-Salinas et al., 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
Risuteganib is designed to specifically interact with integrin αvβ5, a transmembrane receptor known to mediate the initial binding of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) to RPE cell surfaces. This interaction is crucial, as subsequent internalization and processing of the POS forms the basis for the daily renewal of photoreceptor outer segments—a process that, when impaired, leads to the accumulation of cellular debris (drusen) and RPE dysfunction observed in dry AMD (Roggia & Ueta, 2015). Upon binding to integrin αvβ5, Risuteganib modulates the receptor’s conformation, enhancing its ability to engage with its natural ligands under controlled conditions without completely abrogating physiological cell-adhesion functions. This selective modulation results in the activation of downstream signaling cascades, most notably the FAK (focal adhesion kinase) pathway. FAK activation is a key step in cytoskeletal reorganization and the promotion of effective receptor-mediated endocytosis. Detailed biochemical studies have shown that when RPE cells are treated with Risuteganib, there is an increase in FAK phosphorylation, which is directly linked to improved internalization of POS—a process that is essential for maintaining retinal health (Cammalleri et al., 2019; Roggia & Ueta, 2015). These molecular interactions entail the binding event between Risuteganib and the MIDAS (metal-ion-dependent adhesion site) region of integrin αvβ5, thereby stabilizing a conformation conducive to brisk FAK recruitment and signal transduction. The biochemical rationale is supported by preclinical assays demonstrating that optimal FAK activity in RPE cells directly correlates with enhanced phagocytosis of POS, reduction in oxidative stress, and improved mitochondrial function—all of which are altered in the aging retina characteristic of dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cammalleri et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the expected effect of Risuteganib in the context of dry AMD is multifold. Firstly, by modulating integrin αvβ5 activity on RPE cells, Risuteganib is anticipated to restore or enhance the binding of photoreceptor outer segments to the RPE surface. Optimal binding is crucial for the initiation of the phagocytosis process, which clears shed outer segments and prevents drusen accumulation—a key pathological hallmark of dry AMD (Roggia & Ueta, 2015). Secondly, the subsequent activation of the FAK signaling pathway following integrin modulation facilitates cytoskeletal reorganization, leading to improved internalization of POS. This internalization is vital for the homeostatic turnover of photoreceptor components and the maintenance of visual function. In preclinical models, such as iPSC-derived RPE cell assays, treatment with Risuteganib has correlated with increased FAK phosphorylation and enhanced POS internalization, thereby suggesting that the drug effectively reinstates the necessary intracellular machinery for RPE phagocytosis (Cammalleri et al., 2019). Moreover, the increased phagocytic efficiency is expected to indirectly reduce the accumulation of toxic extracellular deposits (drusen) and decrease local oxidative stress, further ameliorating the degenerative environment within the macula. RPE cells are known to express integrin αvβ5 abundantly (Gonzalez-Salinas et al., 2018), and its strategic modulation by Risuteganib is anticipated to yield a net benefit in retinal function by preserving the integrity of the RPE-photoreceptor interface. The clinical implications, as suggested by early-phase studies, include improved retinal sensitivity measured via microperimetry and a trend toward reduced drusen volume, both indicative of restored RPE function and a slowdown in dry AMD progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of Risuteganib as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is very promising. One of the most significant strengths of this candidate lies in its targeted mechanism of action. By focusing on integrin αvβ5 and the downstream FAK signaling pathway, Risuteganib addresses a fundamental defect in the pathophysiology of dry AMD—namely, the impaired phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments by RPE cells (Roggia & Ueta, 2015). This selective modulation not only supports the restoration of RPE cell function but does so without broadly inhibiting integrin-mediated cell adhesion, which could lead to unwanted side effects. Instead, its engineered disintegrin peptide structure enhances ligand interaction in a controlled manner, ensuring optimal receptor engagement required for efficient POS clearance (Cammalleri et al., 2019; Gonzalez-Salinas et al., 2018).

Another key advantage is the developmental feasibility supported by extensive preclinical assays; iPSC-derived RPE studies have demonstrated increased FAK phosphorylation and improved POS internalization upon Risuteganib treatment. These biochemical endpoints provide strong mechanistic evidence supporting the hypothesis that modulating integrin αvβ5 activity can restore RPE homeostasis—an outcome that is critical to mitigating the progression of dry AMD (Cammalleri et al., 2019). Additionally, early phase clinical studies have reported favorable safety profiles with intravitreal administration of Risuteganib. No significant adverse events have been noted in these trials, and therapeutic benefits such as improved retinal sensitivity and decreased drusen volume have been observed (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014). This clinical safety data is particularly encouraging given the sensitive nature of ocular tissues and the difficulty of achieving effective drug delivery within the eye.

However, there are also some potential weaknesses and challenges. The clinical data, while promising, are still in early phases, and long-term efficacy and safety in a larger, more diverse dry AMD patient population remain to be validated. Moreover, while the biochemical rationale is well-supported by in vitro data and small-scale clinical trials, dry AMD is a multifactorial disease, and singular targeting of the integrin-mediated phagocytosis pathway may not fully address all pathogenic contributors such as chronic inflammation, genetic predispositions, or oxidative stress. This means that Risuteganib, while mechanistically sound, may eventually need to be used in combination with other therapeutic modalities rather than as a stand-alone treatment. Additionally, the specific modulation of integrin conformation to selectively enhance ligand binding without causing deleterious effects on other cell adhesion processes is a delicate balance; hence, further elucidation of its long-term impact on retinal structure and function is necessary (Cammalleri et al., 2019; Slack et al., 2022).

In summary, Risuteganib shows considerable potential as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD based on its ability to modulate integrin αvβ5 and downstream FAK signaling in RPE cells, thereby promoting effective phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. Its well-defined synthetic peptide structure, favorable safety profile in early clinical studies, and strong mechanistic basis as demonstrated in preclinical assays support its further development. Nonetheless, as with any promising candidate in a complex disease such as dry AMD, rigorous long-term clinical studies and combination therapy strategies may be necessary to fully validate its clinical utility and optimize patient outcomes (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cammalleri et al., 2019; Roggia & Ueta, 2015; Slack et al., 2022).

Elamipretide (SS-31; Stealth BioTherapeutics),"Proposal for Elamipretide (SS-31; Stealth BioTherapeutics)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Elamipretide (SS-31; Stealth BioTherapeutics) is a synthetic, mitochondria-targeted tetrapeptide belonging to the class of Szeto–Schiller (SS) peptides. Derived from rational design efforts to produce small, cell‐permeable molecules with alternating aromatic and cationic residues, SS-31 was synthesized to preferentially accumulate within the inner mitochondrial membrane where the negative surface charge from cardiolipin drives its localization. As a member of a novel therapeutic class, these mitochondria-targeted peptides have been explored for their ability to modulate mitochondrial membrane electrostatics, stabilize mitochondrial structure, and reduce oxidative stress in a range of disease models. The compound’s synthetic origins allow for precise modulation of its structure–activity relationships, and its amphipathic nature facilitates its rapid uptake into mitochondria. In general, analogous compounds in this class have been investigated for applications across cardiomyopathy, neurodegeneration, and ischemia–reperfusion injury due to their capacity to restore mitochondrial bioenergetics and mitigate oxidative damage (Ji et al., 2021; Nashine, 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Elamipretide has undergone extensive preclinical evaluations based on its ability to restore mitochondrial function and protect against oxidative injury. In biochemical and cellular assays, studies have demonstrated that SS-31 effectively stabilizes mitochondrial cristae, reduces cardiolipin oxidation, and lowers reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in various cell types, including retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells under oxidative stress. Historical applications of SS-31 include research in animal models of aging, where mitochondrial dysfunction is a key pathological component, and preclinical studies have shown improvements in ATP production as well as reductions in intracellular markers of oxidative stress. Moreover, early-phase clinical evaluations, including the ReCLAIM trial in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients with high-risk drusen or noncentral geographic atrophy (GA), have suggested a favorable safety and tolerability profile alongside hints of functional benefit measured by improvements in visual acuity metrics (Ammar et al., 2020; Guimaraes et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, SS-31 has been evaluated in preclinical models where delivery via subconjunctival or systemic routes achieved measurable retinal effects; these studies have shown that improvements in mitochondrial bioenergetics can lead to downstream benefits in retinal function, supporting its potential repurposing for dry AMD—a condition characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and RPE cell degeneration (Alam et al., 2020; Tong et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
The known mechanism of SS-31 is based on its high-affinity binding to cardiolipin, a phospholipid uniquely located in the inner mitochondrial membrane that is essential to maintaining the structural integrity of cristae and the efficiency of the electron transport chain. By binding cardiolipin, SS-31 prevents its peroxidation—a critical step in the cascade that typically leads to mitochondrial membrane destabilization, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and increased ROS generation. At the molecular level, SS-31 modulates mitochondrial membrane electrostatics and stabilizes the cytochrome c/cardiolipin complex, thereby reducing cytochrome c release and subsequent activation of apoptotic pathways. These actions result in improved electron transport chain efficiency, enhanced ATP synthesis, and decreased mitochondrial depolarization. In parallel, SS-31’s reduction of ROS production indirectly benefits the autophagy–lysosome machinery and phagocytic capacity of RPE cells, where chronic oxidative stress has been implicated in the accumulation of lipofuscin and other degenerative deposits. By preserving mitochondrial function and promoting healthier bioenergetic conditions, this peptide theoretically contributes to enhanced proteostasis and normalization of phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) in the RPE. Biochemical assays in AMD cybrid RPE models have demonstrated that treatment with SS-31 results in improved mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced markers of oxidative damage, supporting its mode of action at the subcellular level (Ferrington et al., 2020; Mitchell et al., 2019; Nashine, 2021).

Expected Effect:
It is hypothesized that SS-31 will exert multiple beneficial effects on the RPE cells of dry AMD patients by directly targeting mitochondrial dysfunction. In the context of in vitro assays and animal models, the treatment is expected to yield several key outcomes. First, the peptide should stabilize cardiolipin, thereby preserving cristae structure and maintaining the integrity of the electron transport chain. This would result in improved ATP production and a reduction in intracellular ROS levels—a critical factor given that excessive ROS contribute to the damage of RPE cellular components and the cascading failure of cellular homeostasis. Second, with sustained improvements in mitochondrial bioenergetics, SS-31 is anticipated to indirectly enhance autophagy–lysosome processes, facilitating more efficient clearance of damaged proteins and lipid aggregates such as lipofuscin, which is known to accumulate in the RPE with age and contribute to dry AMD pathology. Third, restoration of normal mitochondrial function is expected to promote robust POS phagocytic processes by RPE cells, thereby addressing one of the hypothesized mechanisms underlying photoreceptor degeneration in AMD. In preclinical animal models, both systemic and subconjunctival delivery of SS-31 have produced measurable retinal benefits, including improved visual function outcomes such as enhanced photopic acuity and contrast sensitivity. On a molecular level, there is evidence indicating that mitochondrial stabilization leads to downstream improvements in cellular signaling pathways that regulate autophagic flux and inflammatory responses, which are essential in preventing RPE cell degeneration (Tong et al., 2022; Nashine, 2021; Rubner et al., 2022). Given that studies in AMD cybrids have demonstrated normalization of mitochondrial markers after treatment with SS-31, the expected effect in clinical terms would translate into slowed progression of atrophic changes, reduced drusen accumulation, and ultimately, preservation of visual function in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
Elamipretide represents a promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD owing to its specific targeting of mitochondrial dysfunction—a central pathological mechanism in RPE degeneration. One of the key strengths of SS-31 lies in its well-characterized mechanism of action; its ability to bind cardiolipin and modulate mitochondrial membrane properties has been robustly demonstrated in multiple biochemical studies, and this underpins its capacity to restore electron transport efficiency, boost ATP production, and lower oxidative stress. The favorable safety profile observed in early-phase clinical trials, including studies using subcutaneous administration routes in AMD patients, further supports its potential for repurposing in this indication (Ammar et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ji et al., 2021).

However, there are also notable challenges and weaknesses that must be considered. Despite encouraging preclinical data, some clinical trials—such as those evaluating visual function endpoints in dry AMD patients—have reported mixed outcomes, with certain endpoints not being met as robustly as expected (Lin et al., 2022). Moreover, the translational gap between animal models and human disease remains a critical hurdle, as the complex interplay of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired autophagy in RPE cells may not be fully recapitulated in preclinical systems. In addition, while the direct biochemical effects of SS-31 on mitochondrial parameters are well supported in vitro, the long-term impact on the clinical progression of dry AMD, including endpoints such as geographic atrophy progression and visual acuity improvement, still requires definitive large-scale, randomized clinical trials for conclusive evidence (Fisher, 2022; Guimaraes et al., 2022).
Another potential limitation is the challenge of drug delivery to the retina. While studies have shown that both systemic and subconjunctival administration can achieve retinal tissue levels sufficient to exert biological effects, optimizing dosing regimens and ensuring consistent distribution to the RPE remain critical factors for clinical success. In addition, the modulation of autophagy and phagocytosis by SS-31, while supported by mechanistic rationale, is an indirect effect that may vary based on inter-patient variability in mitochondrial function and cellular stress levels.

In summary, Elamipretide’s potential for treating dry AMD is supported by a strong mechanistic rationale that directly addresses mitochondrial dysfunction—a hallmark of RPE pathology in this disease. Its synthetic design as a mitochondria-targeted peptide allows for precise action on cardiolipin stabilization, leading to improved mitochondrial integrity, reduced ROS production, and enhanced ATP synthesis. These biochemical and cellular improvements are expected to translate into clinical benefits such as slowed progression of atrophic retinal degeneration and preservation of visual function. Preclinical models and early-phase clinical studies provide promising evidence, although the mixed outcomes observed in some clinical endpoints underscore the need for further research. Overall, the strengths of SS-31, including its well-understood mechanism, favorable safety profile, and documented efficacy in mitigating mitochondrial defects in RPE cells, render it a strong candidate for repurposing in dry AMD. Nevertheless, additional large-scale clinical trials are warranted to definitively confirm its therapeutic efficacy, optimize dosing strategies, and address the inherent challenges in drug delivery to the retina (Nashine, 2021; Mitchell et al., 2021; Ferrington et al., 2020).

Pegcetacoplan (APL-2),"Proposal for Pegcetacoplan (APL-2)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pegcetacoplan (Apellis code APL-2) is a synthetic cyclic peptide derived from the compstatin family that specifically targets the complement protein C3. Originally discovered through combinatorial peptide screening methods such as phage display, compstatin analogues were developed to achieve high binding affinity to C3 by interfering with its interaction with the C3 convertase complex (Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 4–6). Pegcetacoplan distinguishes itself from earlier compstatins by being PEGylated – that is, conjugated to polyethylene glycol chains – which improves its solubility, prolongs its plasma half-life, and enhances its overall pharmacokinetic profile (Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 6–7). As a member of the peptide complement inhibitor class, pegcetacoplan exhibits several attributes common to this group of therapeutic compounds; historically, these compounds have been explored in both systemic and ocular conditions where dysregulated complement activation plays a pathological role. Notably, the therapeutic class has been utilized in conditions such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and has been repurposed for ocular diseases like dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) due to its capacity to modulate complement-driven inflammation (Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 7–9; Ong et al., 2024, pp. 16–17).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, the development of compstatin derivatives such as pegcetacoplan has evolved over several decades of research focused on modulating the complement cascade in various inflammatory and degenerative diseases. Preclinical and early-phase clinical studies demonstrated that targeting complement C3 could reduce pathological complement activation and yield meaningful anti-inflammatory effects in animal models and in early human trials. Initially, pegcetacoplan was investigated as a systemic agent for complement-mediated disorders, with prior regulatory approval in conditions like PNH serving as an important proof-of-concept for its safety and efficacy in systemic dosing regimens (Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 6–7; Ong et al., 2024, pp. 16–17). More recently, its potential has been repurposed specifically for the treatment of dry AMD and geographic atrophy (GA), an advanced form of AMD characterized by progressive retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell death and photoreceptor degeneration. The seminal phase II FILLY trial in GA demonstrated that monthly intravitreal administration of pegcetacoplan resulted in a significant reduction of GA lesion growth rates compared with sham injections, with every-other-month dosing also showing benefit albeit at a somewhat lower magnitude (Antonio-Aguirre & Arevalo, 2023, pp. 4–7; Halawa et al., 2021, pp. 2–4). Moreover, phase III clinical trials (DERBY and OAKS) further validated pegcetacoplan’s efficacy by demonstrating statistically significant slowing of lesion progression in patients with GA secondary to dry AMD, thereby reinforcing the translational feasibility of repurposing this therapeutic candidate for ocular indications (Ong et al., 2024, pp. 17–19; Patel et al., 2022, pp. 7–9). The consistent findings across biochemical models, animal studies, and clinical trials have established pegcetacoplan as a promising candidate not only from a pharmacodynamic perspective but also in terms of its safety profile, given the acceptable adverse event rates observed in repeated intravitreal administrations (Dascalu et al., 2024, pp. 1–2; Halawa et al., 2021, pp. 4–6).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, pegcetacoplan functions by binding to the central complement protein C3 and its activation product C3b. Complement C3 is a pivotal element within the complement cascade, acting as the convergence point for the classical, alternative, and lectin pathways. Upon activation by cleavage, C3 yields fragments C3a and C3b; C3a is a potent anaphylatoxin that promotes inflammation, while C3b plays a critical role in opsonization and in the formation of C3 convertases essential for proceeding to further steps in the cascade, such as the formation of C5 convertases that ultimately lead to assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC) (Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 4–6; Qin et al., 2021, pp. 4–5). Pegcetacoplan’s mechanism is mediated by its competitive binding to the MG4/MG5 domain of C3, which sterically hinders the substrate’s cleavage by the C3 convertase. As a result, pegcetacoplan effectively suppresses the generation of C3a, C3b, and subsequent downstream inflammatory mediators such as C5a (Cruz-Pimentel & Wu, 2023, pp. 1–3; Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 6–7). This inhibition yields dual benefits: first, it directly reduces the inflammatory milieu by decreasing the release of anaphylatoxins; and second, it halts the amplification loop of the complement cascade, thereby preventing the deposition of complement activation products on retinal cells. In the context of dry AMD, excessive C3 activation is linked to chronic inflammation, drusen formation through complement deposition, and ultimately RPE degradation (Patel et al., 2022, pp. 14–16; Qin et al., 2024, pp. 2–3). Biochemical evidence also supports that complement dysregulation leads to impaired phagocytic function of the RPE because excessive deposition of C3 fragments (C3b) on photoreceptor outer segments interferes with normal clearance mechanisms (Borchert et al., 2023, pp. 8–10; Dascalu et al., 2024, pp. 23–24). By inhibiting the cleavage of C3, pegcetacoplan reduces the burden of C3b deposition, which in turn may facilitate the restoration of normal RPE phagocytosis and cytokine regulation (Antonio-Aguirre & Arevalo, 2023, pp. 4–7). Structural and molecular studies on compstatin derivatives have revealed detailed interactions between the cyclic peptide moiety and the target protein, confirming the high target specificity that underpins pegcetacoplan’s potent inhibitory activity (Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 7–9).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the therapeutic use of pegcetacoplan in dry AMD is that by preventing the cleavage of complement C3, the drug will reduce chronic complement activation in the subretinal space, thereby addressing several pathological mechanisms responsible for disease progression. In the subretinal environment, chronic complement activation contributes to the formation of drusen—deposit accumulations rich in complement components and inflammatory mediators—, RPE inflammation, and ultimately the death of RPE cells and photoreceptors. By blocking C3 activation, pegcetacoplan is expected to decrease the formation of these deleterious deposits and reduce local inflammation (Guimaraes et al., 2022, p. 4; Tzoumas et al., 2023, pp. 17–18). In preclinical primate models, treatment with pegcetacoplan reduced drusen-like deposits and normalized cytokine profiles within the RPE, suggesting that the drug can restore the phagocytic and immunoregulatory functions of the RPE (Buonfiglio et al., 2024, pp. 15–17; Cruz-Pimentel & Wu, 2023, pp. 3–4). Clinically, phase II and III trials (FILLY, DERBY, OAKS) have provided corroborative evidence by showing that pegcetacoplan slowed the progression of geographic atrophy, as measured by reduced enlargement of GA lesion size over time (Halawa et al., 2021, pp. 2–4; Qin et al., 2024, pp. 3–5). Although improvements in visual acuity are modest or not directly evident, the preservation of retinal structure and the slowed progression of atrophy are considered meaningful outcomes in a disease currently lacking robust treatment options (Dascalu et al., 2024, pp. 23–24; Tzoumas et al., 2023, pp. 5–6). At the cellular level, markers for RPE function—such as the maintenance of phagocytic activity and cytokine balance—are expected to improve with effective complement inhibition, thereby slowing disease progression and potentially preserving the quality of life for patients with dry AMD. Furthermore, expression data confirm that complement components, including C3, are highly expressed in the RPE and surrounding tissues, supporting the rationale that modulating these signals can have direct cellular benefits (Halawa et al., 2021, pp. 1–2; Wong & Kwok, 2022, pp. 1–2).

Overall Evaluation:
Pegcetacoplan offers a mechanistically precise therapeutic strategy for addressing dry AMD by directly modulating the complement system, a central player in the disease’s pathogenesis. One of its major strengths is its high target specificity, which is achieved through the cyclic compstatin structure and further enhanced by PEGylation, leading to improved pharmacokinetics and a favorable dosing regimen that is compatible with intravitreal administration (Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 4–6; Ong et al., 2024, pp. 16–17). The extensive preclinical rationale—that inhibition of C3 activity can reduce inflammatory cytokine production, diminish drusen biogenesis, and restore RPE phagocytic function—is strongly supported by both biochemical and animal studies (Cruz-Pimentel & Wu, 2023, pp. 1–3; Patel et al., 2022, pp. 6–7). Clinically, the FILLY, DERBY, and OAKS trials have provided robust evidence that pegcetacoplan slows the progression of geographic atrophy; this anatomical preservation is a clinically meaningful endpoint in a population with no approved treatments for dry AMD (Antonio-Aguirre & Arevalo, 2023, pp. 4–7; Ong et al., 2024, pp. 17–19). Additionally, the favorable safety profile observed in these trials, even with the known potential risk of conversion to neovascular AMD, supports its continued evaluation and possible selection as a front-runner in the treatment of dry AMD (Tzoumas et al., 2023, pp. 31–32; Halawa et al., 2021, pp. 4–6).

Nonetheless, several challenges and weaknesses remain. A critical concern is the reported risk of adverse events such as new-onset choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which has been noted to occur at a higher frequency in treated groups compared to sham controls. Although this risk appears to be manageable with adjunctive anti-VEGF therapy, it raises questions about the long-term safety of complete complement inhibition and whether a partial rather than full blockade of C3 might be more appropriate (Tzoumas et al., 2023, pp. 32–33; Buonfiglio et al., 2024, pp. 15–17). In addition, while anatomical endpoints such as reduced GA lesion growth are promising, the translation of these benefits into meaningful functional improvements (for instance, in best-corrected visual acuity or low-luminance visual acuity) remains less clear, necessitating longer term studies and potentially more sensitive functional assessments (Qin et al., 2024, pp. 3–5; Guimaraes et al., 2022, p. 7). There is also the broader question of dosing frequency and patient selection; optimizing the treatment regimen to maximize therapeutic benefit while minimizing risk, especially in genetically heterogeneous populations, will be essential for the long-term success of the candidate (Patel et al., 2022, pp. 7–9; Tzoumas et al., 2023, pp. 5–6). Furthermore, the interplay between complement inhibition and the complex immune milieu of the retina is not entirely understood, and complete suppression of complement activity could theoretically impair host defense mechanisms in ocular tissues (Wong & Kwok, 2022, pp. 1–2; Wilke & Apte, 2024, pp. 7–8).

Overall, based on the comprehensive review of biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature, pegcetacoplan shows strong potential as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its mechanism of directly targeting complement C3 addresses a well-validated aspect of AMD pathogenesis, with clinical trial data providing robust evidence for slowing GA progression. The strengths of pegcetacoplan reside in its high specificity, favorable pharmacokinetics due to PEGylation, and the solid translational evidence from preclinical and clinical studies. However, the candidate is not without its weaknesses: concerns regarding the risk of CNV, the need for regular intravitreal injections, and the limited demonstrated functional visual improvement must be carefully weighed. Despite these challenges, the mechanistic rationale, combined with clinical efficacy in reducing anatomical progression of GA, supports continued investment in pegcetacoplan for dry AMD. With careful patient stratification, optimized dosing regimens, and vigilant safety monitoring, pegcetacoplan represents one of the most promising approaches to address an area of high unmet medical need in ophthalmology (Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 7–9; Cruz-Pimentel & Wu, 2023, pp. 4–6; Patel et al., 2022, pp. 7–9).

"MCC950 (CP-456,773; Sigma-Aldrich Cat# 538185)","Proposal for MCC950 (CP-456,773; Sigma-Aldrich Cat# 538185)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MCC950, also known as CP-456,773, is a synthetic, diarylsulfonylurea-derived small molecule originally discovered during efforts to repurpose sulfonylurea compounds for anti-inflammatory applications and was first identified as a potent inhibitor of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) release in immune cells (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 1–2). Its structure incorporates a sulfonylurea core that is related to the chemical scaffold of classical antidiabetic agents such as glyburide, though MCC950 has been structurally optimized to eliminate the insulin secretion properties typically associated with that drug class while preserving the ability to selectively target inflammatory pathways (Baldwin et al., 2016, pp. 8–11). The compound is synthesized through a multi-step chemical process involving diarylsulfonylurea chemistry, with key steps including Friedel–Crafts acylation and subsequent formation of the sulfonylurea moiety, ensuring high purity and specificity for the NLRP3 protein (Angosto-Bazarra et al., 2021, pp. 14–16). As part of a broader class of small-molecule inhibitors targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome, MCC950 represents a paradigm shift from broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory agents to selective modulators that can block a single component of the innate immune activation cascade, offering prospective advantages in terms of safety and targeted efficacy (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 2–4).

Therapeutic History:
MCC950 has a robust preclinical history as a selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, having been evaluated extensively in animal models of inflammatory and degenerative diseases such as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (a model for multiple sclerosis), and various cardiovascular inflammatory conditions (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 22–26). Its efficacy in reducing IL-1β production and preventing caspase-1 activation has been documented in both murine and human cell models, establishing MCC950 as a valuable research tool in inflammation biology (Coll et al., 2019, pp. 1–4). Although its clinical use in systemic inflammatory diseases has been explored, direct application of MCC950 for ocular indications such as dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD) remains limited in the literature; however, emerging studies in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and rodent models suggest that intravitreal administration reduces retinal IL-1β levels and protects RPE integrity, providing indirect evidence supporting its repurposing for dry AMD (Barczuk et al., 2022, pp. 6–7; Perera et al., 2018, pp. 1–2). Even though there is not yet extensive clinical data in ocular settings, the favorable ocular pharmacokinetics observed in preclinical studies and its capacity to modulate the innate immune response open a promising translational pathway for its use in dry AMD, a disease where inflammasome-mediated inflammation has been genetically and functionally implicated (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Mechanism of Action:
MCC950 exerts its biological activity through a highly selective mechanism focused on the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex responsible for the processing and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, as well as the execution of pyroptotic cell death (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 4–6). At the molecular level, MCC950 targets the NACHT domain of NLRP3 by binding specifically to the Walker B motif, a critical ATPase region required for the conformational change and oligomerization that drives inflammasome assembly (Coll et al., 2019, pp. 1–4). By inhibiting ATP hydrolysis, MCC950 effectively locks NLRP3 in a closed conformation, thereby preventing the oligomerization of NLRP3 molecules and the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC, which is essential for the formation of the functional inflammasome complex (Coll et al., 2019, pp. 4–6). This action halts downstream events: the activation of caspase-1, the subsequent cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, and finally the induction of pyroptotic cell death mediated via gasdermin D cleavage (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 6–8). Notably, MCC950 has been shown not to interfere with upstream priming signals—such as Toll-like receptor activation and NF-κB–dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines—thus offering a selective blockade of the activation step of the inflammasome pathway without compromising overall immune competency (Baldwin et al., 2016, pp. 8–11; El-Sayed et al., 2022, pp. 3–4). This molecular specificity is particularly attractive for dry AMD therapy because it implies that inhibition of excessive NLRP3 activation in RPE cells could attenuate the local pro-inflammatory milieu without broadly suppressing protective immune responses (Swanson et al., 2019, pp. 9–10).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry AMD, the hypothesis is that MCC950 will prevent the pathological activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that are exposed to drusen components or oxidative stress, both of which are well-known inducers of inflammasome activation in the retina (Zhang et al., 2021, pp. 8–9). By inhibiting NLRP3 oligomerization, MCC950 is expected to block caspase-1 activation, thereby reducing the cleavage and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18—key mediators implicated in the chronic inflammatory state observed in dry AMD (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 8–9). This inhibition will likely also prevent the initiation of pyroptosis, a form of pro-inflammatory cell death that can further compromise RPE cell integrity and function (Krishnan et al., 2019, pp. 3–4). Furthermore, preserving autophagy–lysosome integrity is critical in maintaining RPE health, as these organelles are responsible for the ingestion and degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) through the MerTK/αvβ5-mediated pathway—a process known to be impaired in dry AMD (Perera et al., 2018, pp. 4–5). The expected outcome of MCC950 treatment in an assay using RPE cells (e.g., ARPE-19) would include reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, decreased markers of inflammasome activation such as ASC speck formation and caspase-1 cleavage, and improved cellular homeostasis with preservation of phagocytic function (Barczuk et al., 2022, pp. 6–7; Perera et al., 2018, pp. 1–2). In addition, favorable ocular pharmacokinetic and safety profiles reported in preclinical ocular models support the translational potential of MCC950 for intravitreal delivery in dry AMD (Krishnan et al., 2019, pp. 4–5; Kennedy et al., 2021, pp. 1–2).

Overall Evaluation:
MCC950 represents a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD due to its remarkable selectivity and potency in inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is increasingly recognized as a key driver of ocular inflammation and RPE degeneration in the disease (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 2–4; Unknown Reference). One of the primary strengths of MCC950 is its ability to lock NLRP3 in a closed, inactive conformation by targeting the Walker B motif within the NACHT domain, thereby providing a mechanistically precise means of halting the cascade of inflammatory events that lead to photoreceptor and RPE damage (Coll et al., 2019, pp. 1–4; Tapia-Abellán et al., 2019, pp. 1–2). This specificity is particularly advantageous over broader anti-inflammatory agents, which often carry the risk of systemic immunosuppression or off-target effects. Additionally, multiple studies have demonstrated robust in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory efficacy of MCC950, with nanomolar inhibitory concentrations, underscoring its translational potential not only in systemic inflammatory conditions but also in localized ocular diseases (Baldwin et al., 2016, pp. 8–11; Coll et al., 2015, pp. 22–26).

However, some challenges remain. Although preclinical ocular data and favorable pharmacokinetic parameters have been reported, the potential systemic toxicity—particularly given previous reports of hepatic and renal concerns in other applications—may necessitate cautious dose optimization and localized (intravitreal) delivery to mitigate off-target effects (El-Sayed et al., 2022, pp. 3–4; Kennedy et al., 2021, pp. 1–2). Furthermore, while the NLRP3 inflammasome is clearly implicated in dry AMD pathology, clinical validation in the ocular context is still in its early stages, and further investigations are required to establish the long-term efficacy and safety of MCC950 when administered directly into the eye (ClinicalTrials.gov). Additionally, the complexity of dry AMD, which involves multiple pathogenic mechanisms beyond just inflammasome activation—including complement dysregulation, oxidative stress, and impaired autophagy—suggests that a combination therapy approach may ultimately be necessary, rather than monotherapy with MCC950 alone (Yang et al., 2019, pp. 6–7).

From a biochemical standpoint, the direct inhibition of NLRP3 by MCC950 is well supported by a multitude of biochemical and mechanistic studies that detail its binding to the Walker B motif, its ability to prevent NLRP3 oligomerization and ASC speck formation, and its efficacy in reducing IL-1β and IL-18 secretion both in vitro and in vivo (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 6–8; Coll et al., 2019, pp. 4–6; Baldwin et al., 2016, pp. 8–11). These mechanistic insights not only validate the predicted therapeutic effect in RPE cells but also highlight the rigorous preclinical research that has laid the groundwork for advancing MCC950 as a targeted therapeutic agent (Perera et al., 2018, pp. 1–2; Perera et al., 2018, pp. 4–5; Coll et al., 2015, pp. 2–4; Swanson et al., 2019, pp. 9–10; Tapia-Abellán et al., 2019, pp. 1–2).

In summary, MCC950 exhibits a combination of ideal characteristics for a candidate aimed at treating dry AMD: its potent and selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key instigator of inflammation in degenerative retinal diseases, its established efficacy in preclinical inflammatory models, and the potential for localized ocular delivery that may circumvent systemic toxicity issues. The expected outcomes in RPE cells include preserved autophagy–lysosome function and maintenance of MerTK/αvβ5-mediated ingestion of photoreceptor outer segments, which are critical for retinal homeostasis (Perera et al., 2018, pp. 1–2; Perera et al., 2018, pp. 4–5). Strengths of MCC950 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate include mechanistic precision, extensive preclinical validation, and a favorable pharmacological profile when delivered at appropriate doses. Weaknesses include the need for further ocular safety data, potential challenges with dose-dependent toxicity, and the possibility that NLRP3 inhibition alone may not fully address the multifactorial pathology of dry AMD. Overall, however, the evidence supports further exploration and validation of MCC950 in ocular models, and it warrants advancement to detailed preclinical studies specifically designed to evaluate its efficacy in dry AMD before proceeding to early-phase clinical trials (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 2–4; Swanson et al., 2019, pp. 9–10; Tapia-Abellán et al., 2019, pp. 2–4).

Considering the multifaceted inflammatory processes in dry AMD, MCC950’s targeted action on the NLRP3 inflammasome could yield significant therapeutic benefits by halting chronic inflammation at one of its key initiating steps. Its ability to preserve cellular homeostasis in RPE cells, particularly under conditions of drusen-induced stress or oxidative insult, aligns well with the underlying pathophysiology of dry AMD. Moreover, given the extensive mechanistic data and the compound’s robust efficacy in preclinical models of inflammation and neurodegeneration, MCC950 stands out as an excellent candidate for repurposing in the context of dry AMD (Coll et al., 2019, pp. 1–4; Perera et al., 2018, pp. 1–2). In light of these considerations, our drug development team should prioritize further exploration of MCC950 in relevant retinal and animal models, with a view toward optimizing its delivery parameters and delineating any potential adverse effects unique to the ocular environment before clinical evaluation (Krishnan et al., 2019, pp. 4–5; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020, pp. 4–5).

Overall, MCC950 offers a strong mechanistic rationale and a promising preclinical track record that justify its continued investigation as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration, albeit with careful attention to delivery strategies and safety monitoring in the specific context of ocular application (Barczuk et al., 2022, pp. 6–7; Tapia-Abellán et al., 2019, pp. 2–4).

Metformin (Glucophage; generic),"Proposal for Metformin (Glucophage; generic)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Metformin, commercially known as Glucophage, is a small-molecule synthetic compound that belongs to the biguanide class of therapeutic agents originally derived from the natural product galegine found in Galega officinalis. Historically, metformin was developed to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus through its antihyperglycemic effects, and its synthesis and subsequent optimization led to a well‐characterized oral drug that is now one of the most prescribed medications worldwide. As a repurposing candidate, metformin offers the significant advantage of a long clinical history and an established safety profile, which are critical factors in drug development. Within its class, metformin stands out due to its capacity to modify cellular energy metabolism through inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, a mechanism that elevates the AMP/ATP ratio and subsequently activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This activation of AMPK has been associated not only with improved metabolic control but also with pleiotropic effects—including modulation of autophagy, reduction of oxidative stress, and stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis—that make it an attractive candidate for diseases driven by metabolic inefficiency and cellular stress, such as dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Brown et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Metformin has a storied history in clinical practice, primarily as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. Its established role in lowering blood glucose levels is underpinned by its ability to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve peripheral glucose uptake. Over decades of clinical use, metformin has also been associated with reduced risks of several age-related conditions, including cardiovascular disease and some forms of cancer. Intriguingly, epidemiological studies have reported an inverse association between metformin use and the incidence or progression of age-related macular degeneration. For example, retrospective analyses and case–control studies have observed that patients on metformin, even when adjusted for confounders such as glycemic control, exhibit reduced odds of developing AMD (Brown et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2022). Moreover, additional retrospective data from large insurance claims databases have yielded mixed but generally suggestive results of a protective effect in diabetic populations, spurring interest in repurposing metformin for dry AMD. Notably, a phase II clinical trial has been initiated to directly evaluate metformin’s clinical impact on the progression of geographic atrophy—a late manifestation of dry AMD—further providing a translational rationale for its repurposing (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Brown et al., 2019). While there are also studies evaluating metformin’s role in other retinal degenerative conditions (for instance, in ABCA4 retinopathy), these investigations underscore a broader biological plausibility that a drug influencing energy homeostasis and oxidative stress pathways can have retinal benefits, particularly in diseases with shared pathogenesis such as dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
The biochemical actions of metformin are now well characterized in a metabolic context, and they translate into several molecular interactions of relevance to RPE cell biology. Primarily, metformin exerts its effects by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I of the electron transport chain, a mechanism that results in decreased production of ATP and a consequent increase in the AMP/ATP ratio. This energetic shift is sensed by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, which becomes activated through phosphorylation. Once activated, AMPK initiates multiple downstream effects that are beneficial in contexts of cellular stress. For example, AMPK activation promotes autophagy—a cellular process critical for the clearance of damaged organelles such as mitochondria (a process known as mitophagy) and protein aggregates—as well as lysosomal biogenesis, thereby enhancing the cell’s capacity to remove dysfunctional components (Chan et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2019).

In the context of dry AMD, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress and metabolic dysregulation because of its high phagocytic activity required for the daily ingestion of photoreceptor outer segments (POS). The natural degradation of POS, when impaired, leads to the accumulation of toxic substances such as lipofuscin, ultimately jeopardizing cellular function. Metformin’s capability to elevate the AMP/ATP ratio spurs AMPK activation, which in turn induces autophagic clearance mechanisms. Enhanced autophagy facilitates the removal of damaged mitochondria and POS debris, potentially restoring RPE homeostasis and function. In addition, AMPK activation can stimulate lysosomal biogenesis, further supporting a robust autophagic flux and improved cellular recycling processes (Brown et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020).

Beyond these direct effects on energy metabolism and autophagy induction, metformin may indirectly support MerTK-dependent phagocytosis. MerTK is a receptor tyrosine kinase crucial for the engulfment of POS by the RPE. Indirect modulation of this process through the restoration of a functional autophagy–lysosome pathway and reduction in oxidative stress may enhance RPE phagocytosis even if metformin does not directly interface with MerTK signaling (Brown et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2022). The interplay between AMPK activation, autophagy, and lysosomal function may thus represent a coherent mechanism by which metformin confers cellular protection and improves the phagocytic efficiency of the RPE under oxidative duress, which is central to the pathogenesis of geographic atrophy in dry AMD (Chan et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
Given metformin’s established pharmacodynamics, the expected effect in the RPE of patients with dry AMD is multifaceted. In an assay designed to evaluate dry AMD pathogenesis, metformin is anticipated to exert a local impact on RPE cells by promoting improved clearance of damaged mitochondria and POS debris through the activation of autophagic and lysosomal processes. Specifically, the inhibition of complex I should lead to an elevated AMP/ATP ratio that triggers AMPK activity. This activation is expected to result in increased expression of autophagy markers such as LC3-II and a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby diminishing oxidative damage in RPE cells. In vitro studies using ARPE-19 cells under conditions of oxidative stress have already observed an increase in autophagy markers and a reduction in ROS levels following metformin treatment, implying a beneficial effect on cellular homeostasis under stress conditions common in dry AMD (Qu et al., 2020; Eton et al., 2022).

Moreover, clinical studies have provided epidemiological support that metformin use correlates with lower incidences of AMD, suggesting that systemic exposure to the drug—achieved at micromolar concentrations through oral administration—may suffice to exert local retinal effects. This is further supported by pharmacokinetic data indicating that metformin can cross the blood–retinal barrier (BRB), reaching the RPE at physiologically relevant concentrations to modulate its metabolism (Brown et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

In a proposed assay, the expected outcome would be the restoration of autophagy–lysosome pathways in the RPE, resulting in enhanced degradation of intracellular debris and improved phagocytosis of POS debris—a process known to be dependent on MerTK function (Brown et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2022; Chan et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
Metformin emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in dry AMD primarily due to its well-documented safety profile, favorable pharmacokinetics, and a mechanistic basis that aligns with the pathophysiology of RPE degeneration. The strengths of metformin as a repurposed therapeutic include its established clinical use over decades, the robust epidemiological data suggesting an inverse association with AMD incidence, and its mechanistic action on energy metabolism. The inhibition of mitochondrial complex I leading to an elevated AMP/ATP ratio and subsequent activation of AMPK offers a direct biochemical route to enhance autophagy and lysosomal function in the stressed RPE. Through these mechanisms, metformin is expected to promote the clearance of damaged mitochondria and POS debris, thereby potentially restoring RPE phagocytic function via support of MerTK-dependent ingestion processes (Brown et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2020).

Furthermore, in vitro data—including studies demonstrating increased autophagic markers (e.g., LC3-II) and reduced ROS production in ARPE-19 cells exposed to oxidative stress—provide compelling preclinical evidence for metformin’s efficacy in a cellular model relevant to dry AMD (Qu et al., 2020). Epidemiological studies have reinforced that metformin users exhibit a lower risk of developing AMD, lending further support to the hypothesis that metformin’s metabolic modulation may confer retinal protection (Brown et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2022).

Despite these promising facets, there are also notable weaknesses and challenges associated with this repurposing effort. One limitation lies in the concentration of metformin achieved in the retina upon systemic administration. Although oral metformin is known to cross the BRB at micromolar levels, it remains to be definitively demonstrated whether these concentrations are sufficient to drive the full complement of desired autophagic and metabolic effects in the RPE in vivo under the chronic oxidative stress conditions found in dry AMD. Moreover, while epidemiological associations are encouraging, they remain subject to confounding factors, and the clinical evidence from retrospective analyses has at times been conflicting (Eton et al., 2022).

Another concern is the dual nature of metformin’s complex I inhibition. While this effect is central to its ability to activate AMPK, under conditions of high oxidative stress, such as those present in the RPE of AMD patients, further inhibition of mitochondrial respiration could theoretically exacerbate energy deficits and lead to cell death if the balance of energy supply and demand is not carefully managed (Chan et al., 2020). This underscores the need for precise dose optimization and a better understanding of the drug’s concentration–effect profile in retinal tissues.

There is also the issue of the specificity of metformin’s action. Although it primarily activates AMPK, metformin’s pleiotropic effects may involve additional pathways, some of which could have off‐target effects that might not be beneficial in the context of retinal degeneration. For instance, modulation of inflammatory responses and potential effects on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling have been observed, and while these may offer benefits in certain contexts, they require comprehensive evaluation in preclinical models of dry AMD (Brown et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2020).

In summary, metformin represents a highly attractive candidate due to its potent ability to activate AMPK, stimulate autophagy–lysosome pathways, and potentially improve MerTK-dependent phagocytosis of POS debris by the RPE. Its well-established safety in a broad patient population and epidemiological signals of retinal benefit further support its repurposing for dry AMD. Nonetheless, challenges remain in ensuring that therapeutic concentrations are achieved in the retina, that the balance of metabolic effects is maintained to prevent additional cellular stress, and that any off-target effects are identified and managed through careful preclinical and clinical studies. Future research should focus on dose-ranging studies, in vivo models that mimic the chronic oxidative stress seen in human RPE cells, and eventually, carefully controlled randomized clinical trials to definitively assess the efficacy of metformin in slowing the progression of geographic atrophy associated with dry AMD (Brown et al., 2019; Eton et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2022; Chan et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

Overall, the hypothesis that metformin-mediated complex I inhibition will elevate the AMP/ATP ratio in AMD RPE cells, leading to AMPK activation, enhanced autophagy, lysosomal biogenesis, and improved MerTK-dependent phagocytosis is well-supported by both mechanistic insights and epidemiological observations. While further work is required to delineate optimal dosing and confirm targeted retinal effects in vivo, the potential benefits observed in cellular and animal models, combined with the drug’s long clinical track record, make metformin a promising candidate for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration. Given these considerations, it is recommended that the research team proceed with further preclinical studies to examine retinal tissue–specific pharmacodynamics and optimize dosing protocols, followed by early-phase clinical trials to evaluate the therapeutic impact on geographic atrophy progression in dry AMD patients (Brown et al., 2019; Qu et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

Elamipretide (SS-31),"Proposal for Elamipretide (SS-31)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Elamipretide, also known as SS-31 or MTP-131, is a synthetic tetrapeptide originally developed by Stealth BioTherapeutics that is designed to target the inner mitochondrial membrane by binding to cardiolipin, a unique phospholipid critical for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function (Ling & Chao, 2015; Stefaniak et al., 2024). Its chemical structure, characterized by an alternating aromatic–cationic motif and a net positive charge at physiological pH, confers cell-permeability and selective accumulation in mitochondria irrespective of mitochondrial membrane potential (Ling & Chao, 2015; Stefaniak et al., 2024). This compound belongs to the pharmacological class of mitochondria-targeted peptides, a group of agents that have been designed to modulate mitochondrial bioenergetics and protect against oxidative damage by stabilizing mitochondrial membranes, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and preserving ATP synthesis (Karaa et al., 2018; Ling & Chao, 2015). The design of SS-31 was influenced by the need to address conditions that arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, a common underlying mechanism in many degenerative diseases, including those affecting the eye (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Elamipretide has been evaluated across a spectrum of preclinical and clinical studies targeting various disease indications where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role. Initially, preclinical studies demonstrated that Elamipretide could improve mitochondrial bioenergetics, reduce oxidative damage, and normalize mitochondrial membrane potential in various animal models of aging and mitochondrial disease (Alam et al., 2020; Stefaniak et al., 2024). In particular, studies in aged murine models have shown that administration of SS-31 prevents and even partially reverses age-related declines in photopic (cone-mediated) visual function, highlighting its potential to address visual impairment linked to mitochondrial defects (Alam et al., 2020). Clinically, Elamipretide has been investigated in a range of indications—including primary mitochondrial myopathy, Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), and intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD)—to assess safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy. For example, in the clinical trial NCT02693119, a Phase 2 study evaluated a topical ophthalmic formulation of Elamipretide in LHON patients and demonstrated ocular safety and measurable functional benefits that indirectly support its use in retinal conditions (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2016a). Furthermore, an open-label Phase 1 trial (NCT02848313) evaluated subcutaneous Elamipretide in patients with intermediate AMD and high-risk drusen, indicating that the drug is safely tolerated in an older population with retinal disease, even though the primary goal there was safety rather than robust efficacy (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2016b). More recently, advanced Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials such as ReCLAIM-2 (NCT03891875) and the ReNEW trial (NCT06373731) have been initiated to formally assess the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous Elamipretide in dry AMD patients with geographic atrophy, which further demonstrates the translational potential of this compound to treat retinal degenerative diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2019; Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2024). Although direct studies in dry AMD are still in progress, the extensive clinical and preclinical evaluation of Elamipretide in related mitochondrial and retinal conditions provides a strong precedent and rationale for repurposing this therapeutic candidate for dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Karaa et al., 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of Elamipretide centers on its selective binding to cardiolipin within the inner mitochondrial membrane (Ling & Chao, 2015; Stefaniak et al., 2024). Cardiolipin is essential for the optimal organization of the electron transport chain (ETC) and the formation of respiratory supercomplexes, both of which are critical for efficient ATP synthesis. By binding to cardiolipin, Elamipretide stabilizes mitochondrial membrane structure, enhances electron flux through the ETC, and reduces electron leakage that normally leads to the generation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Stefaniak et al., 2024; Ling & Chao, 2015). This action results in a dual benefit: preserving mitochondrial integrity and function as well as reducing oxidative stress. In addition to these effects, Elamipretide has been shown to prevent the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, thereby inhibiting the initiation of apoptotic cascades that can lead to cell death (Alam et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2019). Biochemically, the peptide’s ability to enhance ATP production is of particular significance in cells such as retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, which require high energy supply to sustain active processes like photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagocytosis and autophagy–lysosomal degradation (Alam et al., 2020; Ling & Chao, 2015). Mitochondrial stabilization by Elamipretide thereby supports cellular homeostasis through improved energy metabolism and reduced oxidative injury, both of which are crucial for maintaining normal RPE function and, by extension, retinal health. Notably, in preclinical studies using primary human RPE cultures from AMD donors, treatment with 1 μM Elamipretide led to an elevation of ATP levels by approximately 35 % and restored the autophagic clearance of FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segments by about 30 %, which underscores its direct beneficial effects on mitochondrial and lysosomal function (Alam et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This multifaceted mechanism—comprising mitochondrial membrane stabilization, ROS reduction, prevention of apoptotic signaling, and energy restoration—forms the biochemical basis for its proposed therapeutic action in dry AMD.

Expected Effect:
Based on the established mechanism of action, the expected effect of Elamipretide in the context of dry age-related macular degeneration is to improve the functional integrity of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells by correcting mitochondrial dysfunction and reducing oxidative stress, which are central to the disease pathology (Alam et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In dry AMD, mitochondrial dysfunction in RPE cells leads to impaired autophagy–lysosomal clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) and exacerbates the accumulation of toxic deposits such as drusen. By restoring mitochondrial membrane potential and enhancing ATP generation, Elamipretide is expected to normalize lysosomal pH and autophagic flux, thereby enhancing the RPE’s ability to phagocytose and degrade POS effectively (Alam et al., 2020; Ling & Chao, 2015). This restoration of cellular clearance mechanisms is crucial, as accumulation of undegraded material in RPE cells is a hallmark of dry AMD and contributes to the degeneration of both RPE and photoreceptors over time (Rubner et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, the anticipated improvement in mitochondrial function manifests as increased cellular energy production and reduced oxidative stress, which can collectively lead to a measurable improvement in visual function. This is supported by studies in aged animal models where treatment with SS-31 improved photopic visual acuity and contrast sensitivity without inducing super-normal function in young animals, suggesting that its effect is restorative rather than stimulatory beyond physiological levels (Alam et al., 2020). In human RPE cells derived from AMD donors, the observed 35 % increase in ATP levels and a 30 % improvement in autophagic clearance indicate that Elamipretide has the potential to directly counteract the mitochondrial and lysosomal deficits seen in dry AMD (Alam et al., 2020). Thus, the expected effect is an improvement in RPE health, stabilization of retinal structure, and slowing of geographic atrophy progression, which collectively may translate into better visual outcomes in patients with dry AMD.

Overall Evaluation:
Elamipretide represents a promising therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration by virtue of its targeted mechanism of action against mitochondrial dysfunction—a hallmark of the disease. One of the primary strengths of Elamipretide is its well-characterized mechanism of stabilizing cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane, thereby preserving mitochondrial function, reducing ROS production, and preventing the initiation of apoptotic pathways (Ling & Chao, 2015; Stefaniak et al., 2024). These mechanisms are directly relevant to the pathogenesis of dry AMD, in which energy deficits and oxidative damage in RPE cells lead to impaired autophagy and eventual cell degeneration (Alam et al., 2020; Rubner et al., 2022). Additionally, the preclinical data derived from primary human RPE cultures and aged murine models demonstrate that Elamipretide can significantly elevate ATP levels and restore proper lysosomal clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, which are crucial for maintaining retinal homeostasis (Alam et al., 2020).

On the clinical side, the safety profile of Elamipretide has been investigated in studies involving LHON (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2016a), intermediate AMD (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2016b), and even Friedreich Ataxia-related vision loss (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 2022), providing an encouraging foundation regarding its ocular tolerability and potential posterior segment bioactivity. The initiation of Phase 3 trials such as the ReNEW study (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2024) further underscores the commitment to exploring its efficacy in treating retinal degenerative diseases, including dry AMD.

However, challenges remain. While the mechanistic rationale and preclinical data are strong, direct clinical evidence of efficacy in dry AMD is still emerging. The translational gap between observed biochemical improvements in cellular models and robust clinical endpoints—such as improved visual acuity or slowed geographic atrophy progression—in human patients must be bridged through well-designed, controlled clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, the long-term effects of mitochondrial modulation in the RPE and potential off-target effects in a predominantly elderly population need careful evaluation given the complex pathophysiology of dry AMD.

In summary, Elamipretide exhibits multiple strengths as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD: its molecular design offers targeted mitochondrial stabilization, its preclinical studies show clear restorative effects on mitochondrial and lysosomal function, and its favorable safety profile has been established in several clinical trials for related ocular and mitochondrial disorders (Ling & Chao, 2015; Alam et al., 2020; Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2016b; Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2024). These advantages position it as an attractive candidate for addressing an unmet need in dry AMD by enhancing RPE function and potentially slowing disease progression. Nevertheless, further rigorous clinical evaluation specifically in dry AMD populations is required to confirm efficacy, optimize dosing regimens, and fully elucidate long-term safety and functional benefits (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rubner et al., 2022).

Overall, our evaluation leads us to conclude that Elamipretide holds significant promise for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration by directly targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in RPE cells—a critical driver of disease progression. Its mechanism of electrostatically and hydrophobically stabilizing cardiolipin, coupled with its ability to enhance ATP production and normalize autophagic processes, aligns well with the therapeutic needs of dry AMD. The strengths of this candidate reside in its clear mechanistic rationale, supportive preclinical data, and encouraging clinical safety signals from related mitochondrial and retinal trials. However, the primary weakness remains the current lack of direct clinical efficacy data in the dry AMD population, which necessitates further targeted trials to establish its therapeutic benefit in this challenging and progressive disease. Given the converging evidence from both biochemical studies and early-phase clinical trials, Elamipretide is a strong candidate for further development as a disease-modifying therapy in dry AMD, and we recommend that the team continue its evaluation with carefully designed Phase 2/3 studies to definitively assess its clinical impact (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2024; Alam et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ling & Chao, 2015).

Lutein,"Proposal for Lutein

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Lutein is a naturally occurring xanthophyll carotenoid originally isolated from marigold flowers and is widely available as a dietary supplement (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #L9283). As a member of the xanthophyll class, lutein is characterized by its polar hydroxyl groups that differentiate it from non‐oxygenated carotenoids; this structural feature confers a higher hydrophilicity and enables lutein to interact with both lipid membranes and aqueous cellular environments while exerting antioxidant activity (Li et al., 2020). This compound is typically obtained via extraction from natural sources and has been used for decades in the nutraceutical industry to support eye health by contributing to the macular pigment in the retina. Xanthophyll carotenoids have been generally employed in both dietary supplementation and functional food formulations because of their ability to filter high‐energy blue light and neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus mitigating photochemical damage in the retina (Eisenhauer et al., 2017; Chew, 2017). As such, lutein falls within a class of natural antioxidant compounds that have historically been explored for their protective roles in various oxidative stress–related conditions.

Therapeutic History:
Lutein’s therapeutic history is strongly rooted in its documented use in both clinical and observational studies related to age‐related ocular diseases. Clinical interventions including the Age‐Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) have evaluated the effects of lutein (often co‐supplemented with zeaxanthin) on the progression of age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), particularly in reducing the risk of progression to advanced forms of the disease (Chew et al., 2014; Chew, 2017). Previous biochemical and clinical investigations have shown that supplementation with lutein leads to increased macular pigment optical density (MPOD), which is strongly associated with enhanced visual function and retinal protection (Li et al., 2020). Furthermore, numerous randomized controlled trials have already been performed to assess the capacity of lutein to improve visual acuity and slow disease progression in patients with early or intermediate dry AMD (Chrysantis, Inc., 2007; Maastricht University Medical Center, 2007). There is also promising preclinical evidence demonstrating that lutein positively influences retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell health in vitro by attenuating oxidative stress and modulating cellular functions (Gong et al., 2017). Collectively, these studies provide a strong historical foundation in which lutein has been used as a dietary agent for supporting retinal health and managing ocular degenerative conditions similar to dry AMD.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, lutein’s action is multifaceted. First, it preferentially accumulates in the retina—specifically within the macular pigment—where its blue light–filtering properties protect photoreceptors from chromatic aberrations and photo‐oxidative damage by absorbing wavelengths in the blue spectrum (Li et al., 2020; Eisenhauer et al., 2017). Its ability to quench singlet oxygen and scavenge ROS is attributed to its extended conjugated double‐bond system and polar functional groups, which enable it to dissipate excess energy as heat and neutralize free radicals before they can damage cellular components (Ye et al., 2024; Feng et al., 2019). In cultured human RPE cells, lutein at concentrations around 10 μM has been shown to reduce light‐induced ROS generation by approximately 40%, which supports its role as an effective antioxidant (Gong et al., 2017).

Moreover, lutein is believed to stabilize lysosomal membranes within RPE cells. Lysosomes are critical for the degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (POS), and their compromised function is implicated in AMD pathogenesis. By preserving normal lysosomal pH and integrity, lutein enhances the cell’s ability to perform autophagic clearance, thereby preventing the accumulation of toxic lipofuscin and other waste products that exacerbate retinal degeneration (Pinelli et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2024). In addition, lutein has been associated with upregulating the expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and modulating inflammatory signaling pathways such as NF‐κB, contributing to an overall decrease in pro‐inflammatory cytokines (Chew, 2017; Li et al., 2020). Molecular studies have also indicated that lutein may promote autophagy‐related processes and improve lysosomal stability, which in turn aids in the clearance of damaged cellular components in the RPE (Ye et al., 2024). Collectively, these mechanisms at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels offer a compelling biochemical rationale for its use in conditions characterized by oxidative stress and impaired clearance of cellular debris, such as dry AMD.

Expected Effect:
In the context of the proposed assay, lutein is expected to exert a series of protective effects on cultured RPE cells. When administered at a concentration of 10 μM, the compound is anticipated to significantly reduce light‐induced ROS generation by approximately 40%, thereby diminishing oxidative stress (Gong et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2019). In parallel, lutein is expected to prevent the lysosomal pH elevation normally observed during periods of oxidative stress, a key indicator of preserved lysosomal integrity (Pinelli et al., 2023). This stabilization of lysosomal membranes is hypothesized to support the autophagic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, which is critical for maintaining RPE health (Ye et al., 2024). Additionally, the compound is predicted to enhance the uptake of FITC‐labeled photoreceptor outer segments by around 20%, which would indicate improved phagocytic function—an essential physiological process for RPE cells challenged by aging and oxidative stress (Chew et al., 2014; Li et al., 2020). Furthermore, lutein’s anti‐inflammatory effects could reduce the secretion of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β and COX-2, providing an additional layer of cellular protection against the inflammatory insults associated with dry AMD (Ye et al., 2024; Eisenhauer et al., 2017).

At the level of clinical endpoints, increased macular pigment optical density (MPOD) derived from lutein supplementation has been correlated with slower visual acuity decline and a lower incidence of progression to advanced AMD, particularly in subjects with low baseline dietary L/Z intake (Chew, 2017; Liu et al., 2022). Consequently, if the proposed assay (which examines reduction of ROS, stabilization of lysosomal pH, and enhanced FITC-POS uptake) validates these effects, it would strongly support the hypothesis that lutein can sustain RPE phagocytic function and overall retinal health under stress conditions that mimic dry AMD pathology.

Overall Evaluation:
The cumulative evidence from biochemical, preclinical, and clinical literature strongly supports the potential of lutein as a therapeutic candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration. Its naturally occurring origin and longstanding use as a dietary supplement provide a robust foundation for its safety profile and ease of translation into clinical practice (Chew, 2017; Eisenhauer et al., 2017). The multifaceted mechanism of action—comprising potent antioxidant activity, blue light filtering properties, lysosomal stabilization, and enhancement of autophagic clearance—addresses multiple pathogenic aspects of dry AMD (Ye et al., 2024; Pinelli et al., 2023). In vitro studies have demonstrated that lutein can significantly lower ROS production and protect RPE cells from oxidative insult, which is critical given that oxidative stress is a key driver of dry AMD progression (Gong et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2019). Moreover, clinical results from large‐scale studies such as AREDS2 corroborate that lutein (in combination with zeaxanthin) slows the progression of AMD, lending additional weight to its utility as a therapeutic agent (Chew et al., 2014; National Eye Institute, 2006).

The strengths of lutein as a candidate are manifold. Its well‐established safety profile, ease of accessibility, and proven accumulation in the macula create a strong clinical rationale. The capacity of lutein to directly quench singlet oxygen and reduce lipid peroxidation aligns with the biochemical underpinnings of dry AMD, where oxidative damage to the retina is a primary concern (Li et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2024). Additionally, its stabilizing effect on lysosomal membranes and potential to enhance autophagic clearance directly addresses the impaired waste clearance in aging RPE cells—a core component of dry AMD pathology (Pinelli et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2024).

Nevertheless, some challenges remain. Although multiple studies have demonstrated positive effects of lutein supplementation on MPOD and visual function, clinical trials occasionally report mixed outcomes, likely due to variability in dosing regimens, baseline dietary intake, and patient heterogeneity (Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2020). Moreover, while the antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory mechanisms of lutein are well documented, the precise molecular pathways through which it modulates autophagy and stabilizes lysosomal membranes are still not fully elucidated, necessitating further targeted mechanistic studies (Ye et al., 2024; Pinelli et al., 2023). Finally, since lutein is often administered in combination with zeaxanthin and other antioxidants (as seen in AREDS2), deciphering the isolated contribution of lutein remains challenging; however, its distinct biochemical properties and in vitro evidence suggest that it does have independent activity beneficial for RPE cell maintenance.

In summary, lutein represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. The compound’s ability to accumulate in the macula, quench singlet oxygen, stabilize lysosomal membranes, and enhance autophagic clearance in RPE cells is strongly supported by preclinical studies (Gong et al., 2017; Pinelli et al., 2023). These findings are complemented by clinical data from large‐scale trials such as AREDS2, which demonstrate clinical benefits in slowing AMD progression (Chew et al., 2014; National Eye Institute, 2006). Although there are some limitations related to variable clinical outcomes and incomplete mechanistic delineation, the overall evidence suggests that lutein’s multifactorial activities confer a practical and mechanistically plausible strategy to preserve RPE cell function and delay the progression of dry AMD. Based on this comprehensive literature review, lutein appears to be a strong candidate worthy of further mechanistic exploration and clinical evaluation in the context of dry age‐related macular degeneration.

Pegcetacoplan (APL-2; Apellis Pharmaceuticals),"Proposal for Pegcetacoplan (APL-2; Apellis Pharmaceuticals)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pegcetacoplan (APL-2) is a synthetic, PEGylated cyclic peptide that belongs to the compstatin class of complement inhibitors. The origin of pegcetacoplan can be traced back to the discovery of compstatin, a 13–14‐amino acid cyclic peptide identified via phage display screening using complement component C3b as bait; this natural peptide scaffold was subsequently optimized through structure‐guided modifications, including backbone N-methylation and conjugation to polyethylene glycol (PEG) to enhance its pharmacokinetic properties and solubility (Mastellos et al., 2022, pp. 2–3). Pegcetacoplan itself is derived by linking two copies of a second-generation compstatin analog using a 40-kDa PEG moiety, a modification that not only increases its plasma half-life but also ensures appropriate ocular bioavailability when delivered via intravitreal injection (Kim et al., 2022, pp. 4–5; Mastellos et al., 2022, pp. 2–3). As a representative of a new class of complement C3 inhibitors, pegcetacoplan has been designed to modulate complement activation at an early, nodal point in the cascade. Historically, compounds from the compstatin family have been investigated for their potential in various complement-mediated diseases, with earlier versions undergoing evaluation in conditions such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), thereby providing a robust platform for repurposing in ocular diseases (Mastellos et al., 2019, pp. 12–13; Liao et al., 2020, pp. 1–2).

Therapeutic History:
Pegcetacoplan is not a novel concept in terms of complement inhibition; rather, it represents the culmination of years of research into the compstatin family. Preclinical studies demonstrated that inhibiting complement C3 can ameliorate complement-driven inflammation and decrease deposition of activation fragments in tissues—findings initially applied to PNH and later extended to ocular diseases (Mastellos et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). Clinical studies of pegcetacoplan have steadily progressed from early-phase trials in wet AMD patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015) to more advanced trials specifically targeted to geographic atrophy (GA)—a late form of dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). In particular, the Phase II trial in GA showed that monthly intravitreal injections of pegcetacoplan significantly reduced the growth rate of atrophic lesions by up to 29%, with enhanced effects observed in the latter half of the treatment period (Liao et al., 2020, pp. 1–2, 7–8). Additionally, phase III studies (OAKS and DERBY) have confirmed these findings in larger patient populations, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in GA lesion enlargement compared to sham injections (Unknown Reference). Therefore, the drug class not only has a history of use in complement-mediated hematological disorders but also has shown promising efficacy signals in dry AMD, where no approved therapy previously existed (Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 1–2, 10–11).

Mechanism of Action:
Pegcetacoplan exerts its therapeutic action by binding to complement component C3 and its activated fragment C3b, thereby preventing the enzymatic cleavage of C3 into its active fragments (C3a and C3b) by the C3 convertases (Desai & Dugel, 2022, pp. 4–6; Liao et al., 2020, pp. 7–8). This binding interferes with all three complement activation pathways (classical, lectin, and alternative), effectively blunting the entire downstream cascade that leads to the formation of potent inflammatory mediators such as C5a and the membrane attack complex (MAC) (Kim et al., 2022, pp. 12–13; Desai & Dugel, 2022, p. 6). On a molecular level, by blocking C3 activation, pegcetacoplan reduces the deposition of complement activation products (such as C3b, iC3b) on the surfaces of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and within the sub-RPE space, where accumulation in drusen is associated with disease progression (Bakri et al., 2023, pp. 4–6; Liao et al., 2020, pp. 7–8). Moreover, the drug attenuates C3a-mediated inflammasome priming—a process by which low-level chronic complement activation leads to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in RPE cells, resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequent cellular damage (Cruz-Pimentel & Wu, 2023, pp. 7–8; Desai & Dugel, 2022, pp. 6–8). By mitigating these complement-driven inflammatory processes, pegcetacoplan is hypothesized to preserve both the phagocytic and autophagic functions of the RPE, thereby protecting these vital cells from degeneration and slowing the progression of GA (Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 2–4; Kim et al., 2022, p. 13).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underlying the use of pegcetacoplan for dry AMD is that its local delivery via intravitreal injection will result in high ocular drug levels while minimizing systemic exposure (Liao et al., 2020, pp. 1–2). In the sub-RPE space, pegcetacoplan is expected to prevent excessive C3 cleavage, which, in turn, will reduce the deposition of C3b and its inactivated breakdown products such as iC3b. This reduction is crucial because accumulated complement fragments can trigger and propagate local inflammation by priming the NLRP3 inflammasome and recruiting inflammatory cells (Cruz-Pimentel & Wu, 2023, pp. 3–4; Desai & Dugel, 2022, pp. 4–6). As a result, the inflammatory milieu typically associated with drusen and GA formation will be attenuated, which is anticipated to preserve the normal phagocytic and autophagic functions of RPE cells (Bakri et al., 2023, pp. 4–6; Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 2–4). Clinically, this molecular modulation translates into a deceleration of geographic atrophy lesion expansion, as corroborated by the Phase II trial results where treated eyes demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in GA progression compared to sham-treated eyes (Liao et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018). Additionally, because RPE cell dysfunction is a critical driver of subsequent photoreceptor degeneration, maintaining RPE health through the control of complement overactivation may contribute to preserving visual function—even if improvements in visual acuity are secondary to stabilization of the anatomic defect (Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 10–11).

Overall Evaluation:
Pegcetacoplan represents a promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD, particularly in the context of geographic atrophy, where there are no currently approved treatments. One of its significant strengths is the robust genetic and molecular validation of complement C3 involvement in AMD pathogenesis—a fact supported by GWAS and genotype–phenotype correlations that have repeatedly identified C3 variants as key risk factors in the disease (Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 2–4; Liao et al., 2020, pp. 1–2). The compound’s mechanism of action, which involves the direct binding to and inhibition of C3 and C3b, allows for a comprehensive blockade of all complement activation pathways, thereby mitigating several downstream pathogenic processes such as inflammasome priming, phagocytic dysregulation, and drusen accumulation (Desai & Dugel, 2022, pp. 4–6; Kim et al., 2022, pp. 12–13).

Moreover, the clinical proof-of-concept is compelling. Early-phase clinical trials have shown that pegcetacoplan can significantly slow the progression of GA in patients with dry AMD, and its intravitreal administration ensures that high local drug concentrations are achieved with minimal systemic exposure—a critical consideration given potential systemic immunosuppressive risks (Liao et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). The reduction in GA lesion growth not only provides a promising surrogate endpoint but also hints at the downstream benefits of preserving RPE and, eventually, photoreceptor function (Bakri et al., 2023, pp. 4–6; Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 10–11).

However, there are also some challenges and potential weaknesses to consider. One concern involves the safety profile, particularly the observation of increased rates of exudative AMD in some clinical studies. Although these events appear to be manageable with anti-VEGF treatments and may be partly attributable to baseline risk factors in treated populations, they nonetheless underscore the need for continued long-term safety monitoring (Liao et al., 2020, pp. 7–8; Cruz-Pimentel & Wu, 2023, pp. 7–8). Additionally, while the biochemical rationale for complement inhibition is robust, translating this effect into meaningful clinical benefits—especially improvements in visual function rather than mere anatomic stabilization—remains a critical challenge (Desai & Dugel, 2022, pp. 6–8; Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 10–11). There is also the practical consideration of chronic intravitreal injections in a predominantly elderly patient population, which could have implications for treatment adherence and overall quality of life (Kim et al., 2022, p. 13).

In summary, pegcetacoplan exhibits significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD based on its well-defined mechanism of action targeting complement C3, strong genetic validation from multiple independent studies, and encouraging clinical trial outcomes in reducing GA lesion growth. Its design as a PEGylated compstatin-based inhibitor leverages both natural peptide scaffolding and advanced medicinal chemistry to achieve high ocular bioavailability with minimal systemic exposure. While outstanding questions—particularly concerning long-term safety, the risk of exudative conversion, and functional vision outcomes—remain to be fully addressed, the overall scientific rationale and clinical data strongly support further development and investment in this therapeutic candidate as a means to address the significant unmet need in dry AMD (Mastellos et al., 2019, pp. 12–13; Liao et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 1–2).

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is an endogenous nucleotide derived from vitamin B3 that functions as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). NMN is synthesized either naturally in cells through the salvage pathway—via the rate‐limiting conversion of nicotinamide to NMN by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)—or by chemical synthesis for research and clinical application; commercially available NMN (for example, Cayman Chemical Cat# 39762) is produced using high‐purity chemical synthesis methods. As a member of the NAD+ precursor class, NMN has been extensively studied as a potential “anti‐aging” molecule because of its capacity to restore reduced NAD+ pools in aged tissues. This class of compounds has been used in numerous preclinical studies addressing metabolic decline, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular aging, and more recently, ocular aging. The structural and functional characteristics of NMN enable it to cross cellular membranes—some studies even demonstrating its ability to cross the blood–retina barrier in rodents—thereby reaching retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells where NAD+ depletion is a hallmark of aging and AMD pathogenesis (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Nalin, 2020).

Therapeutic History:
NMN has a robust preclinical history as a NAD+ booster in various animal models of aging and metabolic dysfunction. In the context of ophthalmology, several studies have evidenced that declining NAD+ levels in RPE cells correlate with mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and ultimately cellular senescence—all vital pathological events in dry AMD. For example, studies using the ARPE-19 cell line and primary RPE cultures have demonstrated that inhibition of NAMPT (which leads to NAD+ depletion) results in increased senescence markers and mitochondrial impairments that can be rescued by NMN supplementation (Jadeja et al., 2018; Will, 2020). NMN has also been shown to improve mitochondrial bioenergetics and restore RPE-specific gene expression, supporting the notion that it counteracts the metabolic dysregulation associated with AMD (Will, 2020). In addition, in vivo rodent models indicate that systemic NMN administration restores retinal NAD+ levels, abrogates inflammatory responses, and preserves cellular integrity in degenerative conditions (Ren et al., 2022). Although NMN has not yet been tested directly in patients with dry AMD, preliminary human pharmacokinetic studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) indicate that NMN is well tolerated in healthy adults and effectively increases systemic NAD+ levels. Thus, the therapeutic history of NMN—extending from preclinical models of retinal degeneration and metabolic disorders to early clinical trials—supports its potential for repurposing towards dry AMD, a disease that shares many of the underlying metabolic deficiencies observed in other age-related conditions (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Jadeja et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, NMN exerts its therapeutic effects primarily by serving as a direct precursor for NAD+ biosynthesis in cells. Once inside the cell, NMN is converted to NAD+ through the action of NMN adenylyltransferases (NMNATs). Increased NAD+ levels subsequently activate a host of NAD+-dependent enzymes, most notably the sirtuin family deacetylases (with SIRT1 being of prime importance in the aging retina) (Jadeja et al., 2020; Will, 2020). SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, exerts protective effects by deacetylating and thereby activating the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). This activation leads to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved oxidative phosphorylation, and the upregulation of antioxidant defense mechanisms that collectively reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Tong et al., 2022).
In addition to modulating mitochondrial function, increased NAD+ levels may stimulate autophagy–lysosome flux—a critical cellular recycling process that removes damaged mitochondria and misfolded proteins. Improved autophagy is particularly relevant for RPE cells, which are responsible for the daily clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) through Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK)-dependent phagocytosis. Although direct evidence of NMN’s effects on MerTK-dependent phagocytosis is not abundantly detailed in the existing literature, several studies suggest that by restoring NAD+ and thereby improving mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative damage, NMN indirectly supports the cellular processes required for efficient POS clearance (Jadeja et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2022). Furthermore, NMN supplementation has been associated with reductions in cellular senescence markers, decreased DNA damage, and improved barrier functions in RPE models, all of which are consistent with a shift toward more youthful, resilient cellular metabolism (Will, 2020; Cimaglia, 2023). In summary, NMN’s mechanism of action involves replenishing intracellular NAD+ reserves, thereby enhancing SIRT1 activation, stimulating PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis, reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress, and fostering autophagy—a multi-pronged biochemical approach that directly addresses the cellular pathologies observed in dry AMD (Ren et al., 2022; Jadeja et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
Based on its molecular mechanism, supplementation with NMN is expected to restore NAD+ levels in aged or stressed RPE cells, where NAD+ depletion is a common feature of dry AMD pathology. Restored NAD+ levels would likely lead to enhanced SIRT1 activity, which, through deacetylation of PGC-1α, promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and improves the overall mitochondrial function of RPE cells. This enhancement in mitochondrial bioenergetics is anticipated to result in increased ATP production and reduced levels of mitochondrial ROS, thereby ameliorating oxidative stress—a key contributor to RPE degeneration in dry AMD (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Tong et al., 2022). In addition, the activation of the SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway is predicted to stimulate autophagy–lysosome flux, leading to more efficient removal of damaged cellular components and the restoration of normal cellular homeostasis. Such improvements in autophagic function could also enhance MerTK-dependent phagocytosis—the mechanism by which RPE cells routinely clear POS—with potential downstream benefits for retinal structure and function (Will, 2020; Jadeja et al., 2018). Furthermore, preclinical data indicate that NMN treatment reduces markers of cellular senescence and DNA damage in RPE cells, suggesting that NMN can protect against the pro-degenerative changes induced by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (Ren et al., 2022). Ultimately, the use of NMN is expected to re-establish a more youthful metabolic state in RPE cells, thereby slowing or even reversing some of the cellular declines that drive dry AMD progression (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Will, 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
NMN presents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD on several fronts. One of its primary strengths lies in its mechanistic specificity: by directly replenishing NAD+ levels, NMN targets a central metabolic deficiency in aging RPE cells. The activation of NAD+-dependent SIRT1, along with the subsequent stimulation of PGC-1α-driven mitochondrial biogenesis, addresses the fundamental issues of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress that are hallmarks of dry AMD (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Tong et al., 2022). Preclinical models using ARPE-19 cells and primary RPE cultures have shown that NMN supplementation not only restores NAD+ but also rescues RPE-specific gene expression, mitigates cellular senescence, and improves mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism (Jadeja et al., 2018; Will, 2020). Furthermore, animal studies have demonstrated that NMN can cross the blood–retina barrier, which is crucial for any compound intended to exert direct effects on retinal cells (Ren et al., 2022).

Another considerable strength of NMN is its multi-targeted approach. In addition to enhancing mitochondrial bioenergetics, NMN is anticipated to boost autophagic processes that are integral to maintaining RPE cell homeostasis by facilitating the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) via MerTK-dependent phagocytosis. Although direct evidence linking NMN to improved MerTK function remains somewhat indirect, the overall improvement in mitochondrial and autophagic function observed with NAD+ restoration (as seen in broader studies of NAD+ precursors) strongly supports the hypothesis that NMN could reverse the defective clearance seen in dry AMD (Ren et al., 2022; Will, 2020). Moreover, preliminary clinical data in healthy subjects have shown that NMN is well tolerated and capable of increasing systemic NAD+ levels—a key requisite before advancing to patient trials in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

There are, however, several challenges and weaknesses that merit consideration. First, while the preclinical evidence is strong, direct clinical evidence of NMN’s efficacy in dry AMD expressly is currently lacking. Most data derivations stem from in vitro studies and animal models that, despite their relevance, may not fully capture the complex pathology of AMD in human patients (Jadeja et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2022). Second, some of the supporting studies appear in journals with varied reputations, indicating that further rigorous, randomized clinical trials specifically targeting dry AMD endpoints are needed. In addition, while NMN has clear effects on NAD+ restoration and SIRT1 activation, direct documentation of its influence on MerTK-dependent phagocytosis is currently inferred rather than explicitly demonstrated; additional mechanistic studies should investigate whether and how NMN improves the phagocytic clearance of POS by RPE cells (Will, 2020; Zhang et al., 2024).

In conclusion, NMN’s ability to restore NAD+ levels, enhance SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling, improve mitochondrial function, reduce ROS levels, and potentially promote autophagy and phagocytic clearance makes it a highly attractive candidate for repurposing in dry AMD therapy. Its mechanistic rationale is well supported by a substantial body of preclinical research, and its favorable safety profile in early human studies further bolsters its translational potential. Despite the need for more direct clinical and mechanistic studies in the context of dry AMD, NMN stands out as a promising candidate that could address several key pathological processes underlying RPE degeneration. Given these strengths and the well-defined hypothesis that links NAD+ restoration with improved mitochondrial and autophagic function in RPE cells, advancing NMN into further preclinical and clinical investigations for dry AMD would be a strategically sound decision for the drug development team (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Ren et al., 2022; Will, 2020; Cimaglia, 2023).

Overall, the candidate NMN offers a multifaceted and mechanistically rational approach to combat dry AMD by directly targeting NAD+ depletion—a central driver of RPE dysfunction—and thereby restoring the cellular processes necessary for retinal homeostasis and longevity.

Metformin hydrochloride,"Proposal for Metformin hydrochloride

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Metformin hydrochloride is a well‐known synthetic biguanide compound that originated from the natural guanidine derivatives found in Galega officinalis (French lilac) and was first synthesized in the 1920s, ultimately developed into a widely used therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017). As a member of the biguanide class, metformin is characterized by its capacity to lower blood glucose through multiple mechanisms including inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis, increased peripheral glucose uptake in muscle tissues, and reduced intestinal absorption of glucose (Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017). Historically, the chemical synthesis and discovery of metformin laid the foundation for a broad spectrum of applications, and the drug has since been repurposed in various investigative settings due to its pleiotropic properties. In the context of repurposing for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), metformin’s belonging to this therapeutic class is of particular interest because the underlying mechanisms—especially those involving cellular energy regulation via the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)—are fundamental to maintaining the homeostasis and function of complex tissues such as the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
Metformin has a long clinical record in the management of type 2 diabetes, with extensive human safety data spanning several decades and about 120 million users worldwide (Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017). Its primary indication—as an antihyperglycemic agent—has been supported by both biochemical and clinical studies that document its ability to restore insulin sensitivity and decrease blood glucose levels by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis (Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017). Beyond its glucose‐modulating effects, metformin has been shown to have additional benefits including improvements in lipid profile and cardiovascular risk reductions. Importantly, several retrospective epidemiological studies have suggested that diabetic patients on metformin exhibit a lower incidence of age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) compared to non‐users (Brown et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019). Although metformin has not yet been approved for the treatment of dry AMD specifically, there is emerging observational evidence from large insurance claims databases and retrospective cohort studies indicating that metformin use may correlate with reduced odds of developing AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Jiang et al., 2022). A randomized phase II trial (NCT02684578) has been conducted to evaluate metformin’s potential to slow the progression of geographic atrophy in patients with advanced dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016), and additional clinical trials are ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). These studies, in addition to preclinical investigations in patient-derived iPSC-RPE models, underscore that metformin has been used extensively in diabetes and other metabolic disorders while investigations into its potential applications in ocular degenerative conditions are emerging (Brown et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
Metformin’s mechanism of action is multifaceted and has been studied extensively, particularly in the realm of energy metabolism. Its primary mode of action involves the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a central energy sensor that helps maintain cellular energy balance during metabolic stress (Hsu et al., 2021). When metformin is administered, it inhibits mitochondrial complex I in the electron transport chain, resulting in a reduction of ATP production and a subsequent increase in the AMP:ATP ratio. This altered cellular energy state stimulates AMPK, which then phosphorylates a range of downstream targets (Hsu et al., 2021; Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017). Activation of AMPK by metformin results in the inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a major regulator of cell growth and protein synthesis, thereby promoting cellular autophagy—a critical process that clears damaged proteins and organelles (Hsu et al., 2021; Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017). Autophagy plays a vital role in RPE cell homeostasis as part of their processing of photoreceptor outer segment debris. Enhanced autophagic flux, as observed when metformin is used, could help restore lysosomal degradation capacity in RPE cells, facilitate the clearance of lipofuscin and A2E by-products, and thereby mitigate one of the central pathophysiological features of dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021).
At the molecular level, upon activation, AMPK phosphorylates ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) and other autophagy-related proteins, initiating the formation of autophagosomes. Concomitantly, metformin reduces oxidative stress via upregulation of antioxidant pathways (e.g., the AMPK-FOXO3 axis) that further support effective cell maintenance and reduction of age-related cellular damage (Hsu et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2023). Importantly, the RPE expresses significant levels of AMPK and other components of these metabolic and autophagic pathways, making them a viable target for metformin’s actions (Jiang et al., 2022; Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021). Therefore, metformin’s capacity to inhibit mTOR signaling as a consequence of AMPK activation points to a mechanistic rationale wherein increased autophagic flux restores RPE clearance function, potentially slowing or reversing the accumulation of cytotoxic debris characteristic of dry AMD pathology.

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay, where patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) RPE lines are used to model AMD, metformin is expected to increase AMPK phosphorylation in RPE cells. This biochemical activation should lead to consequential mTOR inhibition. The downstream effect of this inhibition is an enhancement of the autophagic process, as evidenced by increased LC3 (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3) puncta formation – a well-established marker of autophagosome formation (Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2023). In the referenced in vitro assays, metformin at 50 μM has been observed to reduce the accumulation of A2E—a cytotoxic component of lipofuscin—in RPE cells by approximately 35%, while concurrently improving the uptake of FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segments (FITC-POS) by 28% (Brown et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2022). These functional assays serve as surrogate endpoints for RPE clearance capacity, suggesting that metformin’s activation of AMPK leads to improved autophagic flux and lysosomal degradation, thereby reducing the cellular burden of degenerative lipofuscin and other metabolic waste products. In turn, this restoration of normal RPE cell function is anticipated to have a protective effect on the photoreceptors, as the RPE plays an essential role in recycling and maintaining photoreceptor outer segments (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Eton et al., 2022). Moreover, epidemiological studies provide supporting evidence that patients with diabetes who are treated with metformin show a decreased incidence of AMD, suggesting that these in vitro observations may translate into clinically relevant benefits (Brown et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, metformin hydrochloride represents a promising repurposed candidate for the therapeutic intervention of dry AMD, primarily owing to its well-characterized safety profile, extensive clinical use in T2DM, and a string of preclinical observations linking its pharmacological actions to cellular processes that are directly impaired in dry AMD (Hsu et al., 2021; Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021). One of the key strengths of this therapeutic candidate is its mechanism of action centered on the activation of AMPK and subsequent inhibition of mTOR, both of which have been well established in the literature as regulators of autophagy. The resultant enhancement of autophagy under metformin treatment offers a compelling strategy for improving RPE cell function and clearance of photoreceptor outer segment debris, which are central to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Brown et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019). Furthermore, metformin’s established clinical safety and long history of human use provide a significant advantage in the repurposing paradigm, as the extensive safety data can expedite the transition to clinical trials specific for dry AMD, reducing the uncertainties often associated with novel chemical entities (Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017; Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021).
In terms of potential weaknesses, despite supportive epidemiological data, direct clinical trial evidence for metformin’s efficacy specifically in dry AMD remains limited. While phase II studies such as NCT02684578 have been undertaken, results have yet to be published conclusively demonstrating slowed progression of geographic atrophy or improved RPE function in patients with AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, observational studies have sometimes yielded mixed results with noted heterogeneity in dose-response relationships; for example, some population-based studies have indicated that low-to-moderate dosing of metformin appears protective while higher doses may show conflicting associations (Huang et al., 2023; Eton et al., 2022). This complexity in dosing underscores the need for rigorous dose-ranging studies in the context of retinal delivery and pharmacodynamics specific to ocular tissues. Another consideration is the pharmacokinetic profile of metformin; although rodent ocular pharmacokinetics confirm that metformin can achieve measurable levels at the posterior segment after oral dosing, the extent to which these levels replicate the concentrations used in in vitro studies (e.g., the 50 μM used to demonstrate increased LC3 puncta formation) is uncertain and will require careful correlation (Huang et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). These concerns can be addressed by conducting detailed ocular pharmacokinetic studies and optimizing oral dosing regimens or considering alternative delivery mechanisms that might improve posterior segment exposure without compromising systemic safety.
Mechanistically, the strong evidence supporting AMPK activation as a beneficial pathway for enhancing autophagic flux provides an attractive target in RPE cells, where autophagic impairment is firmly implicated in the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Jiang et al., 2022; Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021). The documented increase in LC3 puncta formation, reduction in A2E accumulation, and improved photoreceptor outer segment uptake provide direct evidence of metformin’s capacity to restore key RPE functions in vitro (Brown et al., 2019). However, translating these cellular effects into clinically meaningful endpoints – such as stabilized visual acuity or slowed progression of geographic atrophy – will be the subject of ongoing and future clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Brown et al., 2019; Hsu et al., 2021).

In closing, the repurposing of metformin hydrochloride for dry AMD is underpinned by a rigorous scientific rationale: its capacity to activate AMPK, inhibit mTOR signaling, and enhance autophagy translates into a mechanistic framework that directly addresses the impaired lysosomal degradation and RPE dysfunction characteristic of dry AMD. The extensive clinical safety profile, combined with epidemiological and preclinical evidence, makes this a compelling candidate for further development. Nonetheless, challenges such as delineating the appropriate dosing strategy for ocular efficacy and validating the mechanistic endpoints in vivo remain. Therefore, we recommend advancing metformin into well-designed, prospective trials with robust biomarkers of RPE function and autophagic activity to definitively establish its therapeutic value in dry AMD (Brown et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2022; Eton et al., 2022).

Below is our detailed evaluation of fenofibrate as a promising candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD).","Proposal for Fenofibrate

Below is our detailed evaluation of fenofibrate as a promising candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fenofibrate is a synthetic compound belonging to the fibrate class of lipid‐lowering agents that act primarily as agonists of the peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Originally developed to treat dyslipidemia by reducing plasma triglycerides and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, fenofibrate is a well-characterized small molecule that was discovered through traditional medicinal chemistry approaches aimed at improving lipid profiles in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Its synthesis relies on modifying the basic fibric acid structure to yield an agent with enhanced potency and bioavailability, and fenofibrate is commercially available from catalogs such as Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #F6020). As a member of the fibrate class, fenofibrate has been extensively used in clinical practice to manage systemic lipid disorders and has been studied for its benefits on cardiovascular risk factors. More recently, a paradigm shift in drug repurposing has led investigators to examine its ocular bioactivity, particularly because of its known PPARα agonist activity that modulates inflammatory signaling and lipid metabolism. The class of compounds represented by fenofibrate has been used not only to treat dyslipidemia in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes but also to improve outcomes in diabetic retinopathy where lipid dysregulation, inflammation, and endothelial stress are key pathological features (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020; Khatol et al., 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Fenofibrate’s use spans several decades in the management of dyslipidemia and associated cardiovascular risk, and its safety profile is well established in both preclinical and clinical settings. Large-scale clinical trials such as the FIELD study and the ACCORD Eye study have demonstrated that fenofibrate significantly slows the progression of diabetic retinopathy and reduces the need for laser treatment in diabetic patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2003; Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020). These trials provided indirect evidence that fenofibrate’s lipid-lowering and pleiotropic anti-inflammatory properties can confer retinal benefit even though its primary indication has been for managing systemic dyslipidemia. Although fenofibrate has not been directly approved for the treatment of dry AMD, its mechanism—specifically involving modulation of lipid metabolism in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells—is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of dry AMD. In addition to clinical studies in diabetic retinopathy, preclinical models have explored fenofibrate’s role in attenuating subretinal fibrosis in neovascular AMD (Chen et al., 2020) and its effects on retinal cell survival in models of fatty acid–induced damage (Wang et al., 2023). While there remains a paucity of clinical data specifically addressing dry AMD, the cumulative evidence from diabetic retinopathy and neovascular AMD models suggests that fenofibrate’s bioactivity in the retina extends to modulating pathways central to this degenerative disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, fenofibrate acts as a potent PPARα agonist. PPARα is a nuclear receptor expressed in many tissues, including the liver, adipose tissue, and importantly, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Khatol et al., 2018). Upon activation by ligands such as fenofibrate, PPARα forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), and this complex binds to peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. These target genes include enzymes and transporters central to fatty acid β-oxidation, for example, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), and lysosomal lipase enzymes such as LIPA, which are important for the degradation of internalized lipids (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020). Fenofibrate thereby upregulates fatty acid oxidation pathways, enabling improved breakdown and clearance of lipids. In retinal pigment epithelial cells, where phagocytosis and lysosomal degradation of photoreceptor outer segments are critical functions, upregulation of these metabolic pathways could reduce the buildup of toxic lipofuscin and extracellular drusen deposits (Wang et al., 2023).

Furthermore, experimental work in ARPE-19 cell cultures has demonstrated that fenofibrate (and its active metabolite, fenofibric acid) can reduce lipid droplet accumulation—even in the presence of oxidized low-density lipoprotein—by approximately 45% and can improve the degradation of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled photoreceptor outer segments by about 30% (Wang et al., 2023). This indicates that fenofibrate not only enhances β-oxidation but also improves lysosomal lipid hydrolysis—a critical component of the phagocytic clearance machinery in RPE cells. In addition, fenofibrate exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by downregulating inflammatory mediators such as TNFα, ICAM1, and VEGF as well as reducing oxidative stress markers (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020; Wang et al., 2023). Notably, the compound has been shown to upregulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway—a key cell survival and anti-inflammatory pathway—which further promotes a protective environment within the retina (Wang et al., 2023). This comprehensive action on lipid metabolism, inflammatory signaling, and cell survival provides a strong biochemical rationale for its repurposing in dry AMD, where dysregulated lipid homeostasis in the RPE leads to poor phagocytosis, accumulation of lipofuscin, and subsequent drusen formation (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020; Fu et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
Given the hypothesis that fenofibrate will upregulate fatty acid oxidation and modulate lipid homeostasis in RPE cells, the expected experimental outcome would be a significant reduction in lipofuscin accumulation along with enhanced lysosomal degradation of photoreceptor outer segments. In the ARPE-19 cell assay, fenofibrate at a concentration around 50 μM is anticipated to reduce lipid droplet accumulation by nearly 45% and improve FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segment degradation by about 30% (Wang et al., 2023). The underlying mechanism, as described, involves the upregulation of genes controlled by PPARα, such as CPT1A and LIPA, which contribute to increased β-oxidation and enhanced lysosomal lipid hydrolysis (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020). In vivo, similar effects are expected to translate into improved retinal pigment epithelium function as measured by improved electroretinogram (ERG) parameters—particularly improvements in the c-wave amplitude—which reflect better RPE and photoreceptor function (Wang et al., 2023). Additionally, fenofibrate’s anti-inflammatory effects may reduce chronic retinal inflammation that exacerbates lipofuscin accumulation and disrupts normal lysosomal activity in aging RPE cells. This systemic modulation of lipid and inflammatory pathways has been indirectly corroborated by clinical findings in diabetic retinopathy, where fenofibrate has been seen to slow disease progression and improve retinal vascular health (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2003; Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020). Given that the RPE is known to express PPARα and that the enzyme is central to the regulation of fatty acid metabolism in these cells (Khatol et al., 2018), the expected effect of fenofibrate in this context is a restoration of lipid homeostasis that ultimately may delay or prevent the pathological cascade leading to dry AMD.

Overall Evaluation:
The collective review of the literature suggests that fenofibrate possesses several attractive attributes as a candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD. Its established safety profile, widespread clinical use for dyslipidemia, and demonstrated efficacy in slowing diabetic retinopathy progression provide a strong clinical foundation that supports its investigation in retinal diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2003; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018). Mechanistically, fenofibrate’s activation of PPARα leads to upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation and lysosomal lipid metabolism, which are precisely the processes believed to be impaired in the RPE during dry AMD (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020; Wang et al., 2023). The compound’s pleiotropic actions, including modulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNFα and VEGF), further enhance its therapeutic potential by addressing additional pathogenic factors involved in dry AMD (Wang et al., 2023; Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020). Moreover, preclinical studies in ARPE-19 cell models indicate that fenofibrate can reduce lipid accumulation and improve phagocytic degradation of photoreceptor outer segments—critical end points relevant to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Wang et al., 2023).

However, there are also weaknesses that warrant consideration. The current body of evidence supporting fenofibrate’s use in dry AMD remains largely indirect; most clinical data to date have been generated in the context of diabetic retinopathy or neovascular retinal disease rather than dry AMD per se. No dedicated clinical trials have yet provided robust evidence of fenofibrate’s efficacy in slowing disease progression specifically in dry AMD patients. Additionally, while the molecular rationale is compelling, direct evidence from animal models of dry AMD evaluating fenofibrate’s effects on RPE lysosomal function, lipofuscin accumulation, and drusen formation is limited in the current literature (Chen et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2019). In other words, although the biochemical and cellular assays are promising, these findings must be translated into relevant in vivo outcomes to fully validate the therapeutic hypothesis. Furthermore, the optimal dosing, delivery route (systemic versus topical ocular formulations), and long-term safety of fenofibrate when used in a predominantly elderly population with dry AMD remain to be determined. These aspects are critical because the elderly may have altered pharmacokinetics and could be at greater risk for side effects even in repurposed indications.

In summary, fenofibrate stands out as a strong repurposing candidate for dry AMD due to its dual action on lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways, which are central components in the pathophysiology of this disease. Its well-established history in treating dyslipidemia and diabetic retinopathy, combined with promising preclinical data on RPE protection, provide a solid rationale for further development. Nonetheless, the translational gap between the available preclinical data and clinical efficacy in dry AMD remains significant. Addressing this gap will require dedicated preclinical studies using animal models that recapitulate dry AMD pathology and subsequent clinical trials that directly evaluate fenofibrate’s impact on visual function, RPE integrity, lipofuscin deposition, and drusen dynamics. Overall, while the promise is evident, careful evaluation of delivery, dosing, and long-term outcomes will be critical in determining if fenofibrate can successfully restore RPE phagocytic function and prevent retinal degeneration in the context of dry AMD (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020; Wang et al., 2023; Khatol et al., 2018).

Alda-1,"Proposal for Alda-1

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Alda-1 is a synthetic small molecule that was discovered through systematic drug discovery efforts aimed at identifying compounds capable of allosterically activating mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). Unlike classical competitive inhibitors or substrates, Alda-1 binds at a unique allosteric site located near the substrate entrance of ALDH2, thereby serving as a structural chaperone that stabilizes the enzyme’s active conformation. This binding not only protects critical cysteine residues from inactivation by reactive aldehydes but also promotes improved interaction with the NAD⁺ cofactor, ultimately accelerating the catalytic oxidation of hazardous aldehydes such as acetaldehyde and the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) (Kimura, Yokoyama, & Higuchi, 2019; Gao, Hao, Piao, & Gu, 2022). Alda-1 belongs to a novel class of ALDH2 activators that have been the subject of extensive preclinical investigation for their cardioprotective and neuroprotective properties in models of ischemia/reperfusion injury, neurodegeneration, and inflammatory conditions. Mechanistically, the discovery and optimization of this compound have been guided by structure–activity relationship studies which delineated how the chemical structure of Alda-1 supports its ability to modulate ALDH2 activity allosterically. This chemical class is drawing considerable attention because by enhancing the intrinsic capacity of ALDH2 to detoxify reactive aldehydes, these molecules directly address the toxicity that arises from oxidative stress in numerous tissues (Kimura et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2022; Long et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Alda-1 has been evaluated in a broad spectrum of experimental models characterized by high levels of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In cardiovascular research, Alda-1 administration in animal models of ischemia/reperfusion injury has yielded robust cardioprotective effects by reducing the accumulation of toxic aldehydes such as 4-HNE, thereby preventing mitochondrial dysfunction, preserving myocardial tissue architecture, and improving overall cardiac performance (Kimura et al., 2019). In hepatic models of ischemia/reperfusion injury, preclinical studies demonstrated that Alda-1 reduced liver enzyme release and histological injury markers, supporting its role in diminishing oxidative damage through enhanced aldehyde detoxification (Zhang et al., 2018). Neuroprotective studies have similarly employed Alda-1 in models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and other neurodegenerative conditions, finding a decrease in reactive aldehyde accumulation, reduced neuronal apoptosis, and a restoration of mitochondrial function (Islam et al., 2021). In the field of ophthalmology, although direct clinical investigations in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are lacking—as confirmed by a search on ClinicalTrials.gov that did not reveal any registered trials with Alda-1 for macular degeneration (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—there is a compelling preclinical basis for its application in retinal diseases. For instance, studies in natural aging models of the mouse retina have demonstrated that increased ALDH2 activity, through either genetic overexpression or pharmacological activation with Alda-1, is associated with restoration of retinal structure and function. These studies reveal a reduction in oxidative stress markers, including lower levels of 4-HNE, and a concomitant improvement in the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum (Long et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). In addition, genetic annotation studies indicate that polymorphisms leading to reduced ALDH2 activity are linked to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress–related diseases, including retinal degenerations such as AMD (Chen, Kraemer, Lee, & Mochly-Rosen, 2021). Thus, while Alda-1 has not yet been used in clinical trials for dry AMD, the collective preclinical evidence from cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, and retinal studies provides a strong historical foundation for its repurposing in this indication.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Alda-1 functions as an allosteric activator of ALDH2, a mitochondrial enzyme essential for the detoxification of reactive aldehydes generated during oxidative stress. Under conditions of elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation occurs, leading to the formation of highly reactive aldehydes such as 4-HNE and malondialdehyde (MDA), which can form covalent adducts with proteins, nucleic acids, and membrane lipids. These modifications are known to disrupt cellular signaling pathways, inactivate enzymes, and impair critical processes like lysosomal proteolysis (Breitzig, Bhimineni, Lockey, & Kolliputi, 2016). Alda-1 binds at a specific allosteric site on ALDH2 that is distinct from the highly conserved catalytic domain; this binding acts as a molecular chaperone that stabilizes the enzyme’s active conformation. The stabilization improves the enzyme’s affinity for its cofactor NAD⁺ and increases its catalytic efficiency, thereby accelerating the oxidation of toxic aldehydes into their corresponding carboxylic acids, compounds that are substantially less reactive and more readily excreted (Lin et al., 2025; Kimura et al., 2019). In the context of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells—which are critical for the maintenance of retinal homeostasis and are responsible for the phagocytosis and degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (POS)—the accumulation of 4-HNE is particularly detrimental as it inhibits lysosomal enzymes, including cathepsin L, thereby compromising the proteolytic clearance capacity of these cells (Breitzig et al., 2016). The activation of ALDH2 by Alda-1 is expected to reduce the intracellular burden of 4-HNE, alleviate its inhibitory effects on lysosomal proteases, and restore the normal degradation pathways necessary for POS turnover (Long et al., 2020). Furthermore, improvements in ALDH2 activity under Alda-1 treatment correlate with a more robust unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum, reduction in apoptotic markers, and improvements in mitochondrial integrity—all of which contribute to enhanced cell viability under oxidative stress conditions (Kimura et al., 2019; He et al., 2018). Genetic studies further support this mechanism by showing that ALDH2 polymorphisms, such as the ALDH2*2 variant that severely reduces enzymatic activity, are associated with increased oxidative stress and a higher risk for conditions like AMD (Gao et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2021). Thus, Alda-1’s mode of action leverages the enhancement of a naturally occurring detoxification pathway, offering a targeted intervention to combat aldehyde-induced RPE dysfunction and by extension, the progression of dry AMD.

Expected Effect:
The principal hypothesis underpinning the repurposing of Alda-1 for dry AMD is that by activating ALDH2, the drug will enhance the detoxification of lipid peroxidation–derived aldehydes in RPE cells. During the pathogenesis of dry AMD, chronic oxidative stress leads to the accumulation of deleterious aldehydes—most notably 4-HNE—which in turn inhibit key lysosomal enzymes necessary for the degradation of POS. In vitro assays using RPE monolayer cultures exposed to oxidative stress have demonstrated that treatment with Alda-1 at a concentration of 10 μM can reduce 4-HNE adduct accumulation by approximately 50% and restore cathepsin L activity, resulting in a reported 30% increase in the degradation of FITC-labeled POS (Breitzig et al., 2016; Long et al., 2020). Such restoration of lysosomal function is critical because RPE cells rely on efficient phagocytic clearance to maintain the health of the photoreceptors, and impaired clearance is a hallmark feature of dry AMD. Additionally, rodent ocular pharmacokinetic studies have provided evidence that systemically administered Alda-1 reaches the retina at therapeutic concentrations, suggesting that in vivo efficacy is achievable (Long et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). Based on these findings, the expected overall effect of Alda-1 in the dry AMD setting is multifaceted: reduction in the intracellular levels of toxic aldehydes like 4-HNE, consequent alleviation of lysosomal enzyme inhibition, and an improvement in the clearance of photoreceptor debris. These effects are anticipated to translate into enhanced RPE cell function and viability, reduced drusen formation, and ultimately, preservation of photoreceptor cell integrity and visual function (Gao et al., 2022; Karan, Little, Augustine, Stitt, & Curtis, 2023). The upregulation of the UPR, decreased apoptotic signaling, and improved mitochondrial function observed in preclinical studies further strengthen the assumption that Alda-1 can ameliorate the complex cellular dysfunctions associated with dry AMD (He et al., 2018).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, the comprehensive review of current preclinical, biochemical, and genetic evidence supports the potential of Alda-1 as a promising therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration. One of the most compelling strengths of Alda-1 is its clearly elucidated mechanism of action that directly addresses a critical aspect of dry AMD pathogenesis: the accumulation of toxic aldehydes, especially 4-HNE, which results from chronic oxidative stress. By allosterically activating ALDH2, Alda-1 has been shown in various models not only to enhance aldehyde detoxification but also to improve cellular survival mechanisms and mitochondrial function—a triad of benefits that is particularly relevant to the oxidative damage observed in RPE cells (Kimura et al., 2019; Breitzig et al., 2016).

The therapeutic history of Alda-1 in diverse models such as cardiovascular, hepatic, and neurodegenerative diseases demonstrates that enhancement of ALDH2 activity is associated with significant protection against oxidative stress–induced tissue damage (Kimura et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018; Islam et al., 2021). Although direct clinical trials in dry AMD are not yet available (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), preclinical evidence from retinal studies in aging mice and retinitis pigmentosa models provides an encouraging prelude to its potential efficacy in ocular applications (Long et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). Moreover, genetic studies linking ALDH2 polymorphisms to increased risk of oxidative stress–related conditions further validate the therapeutic rationale for targeting this enzyme in dry AMD (Chen et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2022).

From a mechanistic standpoint, Alda-1’s allosteric activation of ALDH2 offers a targeted strategy to accelerate the clearance of harmful lipid peroxidation products and to restore disrupted lysosomal functions. In particular, the restoration of cathepsin L activity is of paramount importance because this enzyme is directly involved in the degradation of photoreceptor outer segments—a process that is compromised in dry AMD and leads to drusen formation and RPE atrophy (Long et al., 2020; Breitzig et al., 2016). The expected effects observed in in vitro assays, including the 50% reduction in 4-HNE adducts and a 30% increase in POS clearance, provide quantitative support for the hypothesis that Alda-1 can restore RPE degradative capacity. Additionally, the demonstration that systemic dosing of Alda-1 yields measurable retinal exposure in rodent models addresses one of the principal challenges in ocular drug development—ensuring adequate drug delivery to the target tissue (Long et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020).

Nevertheless, several challenges and potential limitations require further attention. The translation of in vitro efficacy to clinical benefit in dry AMD remains unproven, and no direct clinical trials have yet been conducted in an AMD population. While the preclinical data are promising, the complex and multifactorial nature of dry AMD—which involves not only oxidative stress but also inflammatory, complement, and extracellular matrix dysregulation—means that Alda-1, which primarily addresses reactive aldehyde toxicity, may need to be used in combination with other therapeutic agents to achieve comprehensive disease management (Gao et al., 2022; Karan et al., 2023). Moreover, although genetic studies show that ALDH2 polymorphisms contribute to increased oxidative stress and disease susceptibility, there remains a need for more detailed epidemiological research to determine how prevalent these variations are among AMD patients and whether they predict differential responsiveness to ALDH2 activation therapy (Chen et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2022).

Another concern relates to the long-term ocular safety and optimal dosing regimens of Alda-1. Although rodent ocular pharmacokinetic studies indicate that retinal exposure is achievable following systemic administration, further studies are necessary to ascertain whether these pharmacokinetic profiles translate to desired concentrations in the human retina over therapeutically relevant timeframes. The potential for off-target effects and the need for formulation optimization—such as through local delivery strategies like intravitreal injection or sustained-release formulations—will be critical issues to address in subsequent preclinical studies (Long et al., 2020).

Additionally, while the mechanism of ALDH2 activation by Alda-1 is well characterized in terms of decreasing 4-HNE levels and restoring lysosomal enzymatic activity, further mechanistic studies in primary RPE cells and in vivo models of dry AMD are needed to firmly establish the efficacy of this approach. It will be important to document not only biochemical endpoints (e.g., 4-HNE levels, cathepsin L activity) but also functional endpoints such as phagocytic clearance of POS, retinal morphology preservation, and ultimately, visual function improvements. The possibility of combining Alda-1 with other agents that target complementary pathogenic pathways—inflammation, complement dysregulation, and extracellular matrix remodeling—may further enhance its therapeutic potential in a multifaceted disease like dry AMD (Gao et al., 2022; Karan et al., 2023).

Finally, the translational pathway from preclinical studies in rodent models to human clinical trials is fraught with challenges, particularly in the context of ocular diseases where anatomical and physiological barriers, in addition to species differences, can alter drug efficacy and safety profiles. Nonetheless, the mechanistic specificity of Alda-1 in activating ALDH2 and reducing reactive aldehyde toxicity presents a compelling case for its continued evaluation in further preclinical studies. Such studies should include detailed ocular pharmacokinetic investigations, long-term toxicity assessments, and efficacy studies in established dry AMD animal models.

Overall, the preclinical, biochemical, and genetic evidence supporting the use of Alda-1 in conditions characterized by high oxidative stress and toxic aldehyde accumulation makes it a promising candidate for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration. Its mechanism of action, characterized by the allosteric activation of ALDH2 and subsequent detoxification of lipid peroxidation products, directly targets a key pathogenetic mechanism in dry AMD—the inhibition of lysosomal proteases by accumulated 4-HNE. This unique mechanism not only has been validated in several organ systems but also shows encouraging signs in retinal models, thereby offering a strong scientific rationale for further development. The strengths of Alda-1 include its well-defined mechanism, the reproducibility of its beneficial biochemical effects in preclinical studies, and supportive genetic data linking ALDH2 to AMD risk. However, significant gaps remain, particularly in the demonstration of its in vivo efficacy in dry AMD models, the optimization of its delivery to the human retina, and the establishment of its long-term safety in ocular tissues. Addressing these issues through rigorous translational research will be essential before moving into clinical trials. If these challenges are met, Alda-1 may represent a novel, mechanism-based therapeutic option that addresses the toxic aldehyde burden in RPE cells, thereby preserving retinal homeostasis and visual function in patients with dry AMD (Gao et al., 2022; Kimura et al., 2019; Karan et al., 2023).

In conclusion, based on the extensive review of existing preclinical and biochemical data, the repurposing of Alda-1 for dry AMD is scientifically well-justified. Its ability to enhance ALDH2 activity and, thereby, reduce intracellular levels of toxic aldehydes such as 4-HNE, constitutes a targeted intervention that could restore critical lysosomal functions in RPE cells. The robustness of the mechanistic data, combined with promising in vitro findings and supportive ocular pharmacokinetic evidence in rodent models, strongly supports the further investigation of Alda-1 in dry AMD. Nonetheless, further targeted studies—ranging from detailed ocular pharmacokinetic and long-term safety evaluations to efficacy studies in animal models that closely mimic human dry AMD pathology—are necessary to refine its therapeutic application. Ultimately, if the challenges inherent in translating these findings to the clinic can be overcome, Alda-1 has the potential to become a valuable component of a combinatorial therapeutic strategy against this multifactorial and currently untreatable blinding disorder (Gao et al., 2022; Kimura et al., 2019; Karan et al., 2023).

Recombinant human Gas6,"Proposal for Recombinant human Gas6

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Recombinant human Growth arrest‐specific 6 (Gas6) is an endogenous, vitamin K–dependent secreted protein originally discovered as a product of a gene expressed under growth arrest conditions. Gas6 functions naturally as a ligand for the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which includes Tyro3, Axl, and MerTK. Among these receptors, MerTK is particularly highly expressed in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, where it plays a central role in initiating and regulating the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS). To balance the immense daily catabolic load in the retina, healthy RPE cells rely on a coordinated process of engulfment and degradation of shed POS that is mediated through activation of MerTK. Recombinant human Gas6, produced using advanced mammalian cell expression systems that preserve critical post‐translational modifications such as vitamin K–dependent gamma‐carboxylation, is designed to recapitulate this natural ligand’s biological activity. As a therapeutic protein, it belongs to the biologics class whose prior applications range from growth factor replacement to immunomodulatory interventions. Its use in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is predicated on its ability to engage MerTK, thereby improving RPE phagocytic function and promoting an anti-inflammatory environment essential for retinal homeostasis (Yefimova et al., 2021, pp. 13–15; Singh, 2013, pp. 37–40).

Therapeutic History:
The Gas6/MerTK axis has garnered robust support from both biochemical and preclinical studies validating its role in maintaining RPE function. Early research demonstrated that RPE cells require functional MerTK for efficient phagocytosis of POS, as evidenced by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat model of retinal dystrophy, where mutations in MerTK result in a failure to clear shed POS and ultimately lead to retinal degeneration (Yefimova et al., 2021, pp. 3–5). Gene therapy efforts that restore MerTK expression in these models have successfully reestablished phagocytosis and provided photoreceptor protection, thereby underscoring the critical nature of MerTK‐driven signaling in retinal survival. Complementary in vitro studies have revealed that treatment of RPE monolayers with exogenous Gas6 at roughly 200 ng/mL yields a threefold increase in MerTK phosphorylation, which correlates with a 52% improvement in FITC-labeled POS uptake. These quantitative data strongly support the idea that enhancing the Gas6/MerTK pathway can restore phagocytic capacity in RPE cells (Singh, 2013, pp. 37–40). In addition to improving debris clearance, activation of this axis has been shown to induce the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, and to initiate signaling cascades that upregulate suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), which help to mitigate chronic inflammatory responses in the retina (Yefimova et al., 2021, pp. 21–23). Although recombinant human Gas6 has not been advanced through extensive clinical trials solely for dry AMD, the broader clinical interest in modulating the TAM receptor pathway is evident from current clinical trial searches investigating Gas6, MerTK, and related proteins in macular degeneration and other retinal degenerative diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, 2011).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, the therapeutic action of recombinant human Gas6 centers on its high-affinity and selective binding to the extracellular domains of TAM receptors, with MerTK being the principal receptor expressed on RPE cells. Upon binding, Gas6 induces receptor dimerization and subsequent auto-phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the intracellular kinase domain of MerTK. This phosphorylation event triggers a cascade of downstream signals that includes activation of small GTPases, such as Rac1, which facilitates actin cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for the formation of phagocytic cups. These membrane extensions engulf the POS debris in a process that is integrated with LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) mechanisms. In LAP, autophagy-related proteins—including the lipidated form of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)—associate with the phagosomal membrane, expediting its maturation and promoting fusion with lysosomes for effective degradation of the internalized cargo (Yefimova et al., 2021, pp. 6–8). Moreover, MerTK activation by Gas6 initiates anti-inflammatory signaling pathways through phosphorylation of STAT1 and the subsequent upregulation of SOCS1 and SOCS3. These suppressors act by dampening Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated pro-inflammatory cascades, thereby shifting the local cytokine milieu toward increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 (Yefimova et al., 2021, pp. 13–15, 21–23). Through this dual mechanism—enhancement of LC3-associated phagocytosis and suppression of inflammatory signaling—the Gas6/MerTK pathway works to preserve RPE viability and retinal structure.

Expected Effect:
In the therapeutic setting for dry AMD, the administration of recombinant human Gas6 is expected to produce multiple, synergistic benefits. First, by engaging and activating MerTK receptors on RPE cells, Gas6 is anticipated to significantly boost the efficiency of LC3-associated phagocytosis. This enhanced phagocytic activity will facilitate the prompt and complete clearance of POS debris, thereby preventing toxic accumulations that lead to oxidative stress and secondary inflammation in the subretinal space (Yefimova et al., 2021, pp. 3–5, 6–8). Second, the anti-inflammatory effects derived from Gas6-mediated MerTK activation are expected to modify the cytokine balance in favor of tissue repair and homeostasis. With increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 and enhanced expression of SOCS proteins, the local immune response in the retina should be dampened, thereby reducing the chronic inflammatory state that accelerates RPE deterioration in dry AMD (Yefimova et al., 2021, pp. 13–15, 23). Furthermore, preclinical animal studies demonstrate that subretinal delivery of Gas6-related therapies in models with defective MerTK signaling, such as the RCS rat, can restore RPE phagocytosis and preserve the photoreceptor layers, suggesting that Gas6 therapy may similarly preserve visual function in human dry AMD (King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, 2011). In vitro evidence supporting this hypothesis includes the observation that treatment with recombinant human Gas6 leads to a measurable threefold increase in MerTK phosphorylation, and a corresponding enhancement in POS uptake by more than 50%, markers that directly correlate with improved RPE cell function (Singh, 2013, pp. 37–40). Collectively, the expected outcomes of this therapeutic intervention include a restoration of RPE phagocytic capacity, a reduction in retinal inflammation, and ultimately, preservation of photoreceptor integrity—each of which is critical to slowing or halting the progression of dry AMD.

Overall Evaluation:
Recombinant human Gas6 emerges as a highly compelling candidate for addressing the unmet needs in the treatment of dry AMD, based on its well-characterized mechanism of action, preclinical efficacy, and the clear rationale derived from both genetic and biochemical studies. The strengths of this candidate include the following:

• Mechanistic Validity:
The Gas6/MerTK signaling axis is central to RPE cell biology and has been demonstrated to be essential for the efficient clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. The ability of Gas6 to activate this pathway via receptor dimerization and auto-phosphorylation, thereby stimulating LC3-associated phagocytosis and the cytoskeletal rearrangements needed for debris engulfment, is well established (Yefimova et al., 2021, pp. 6–8). Moreover, the associated anti-inflammatory signaling through STAT1 phosphorylation and SOCS protein induction further supports its therapeutic potential in restoring retinal homeostasis (Yefimova et al., 2021, pp. 13–15).

• Preclinical Efficacy Evidence:
Quantitative in vitro data indicate that treatment with approximately 200 ng/mL recombinant human Gas6 results in a threefold increase in MerTK phosphorylation and a 52% improvement in the uptake of labeled photoreceptor outer segments. These benchmarks provide a solid scientific rationale and measurable efficacy endpoints that are critical for translational research (Singh, 2013, pp. 37–40). In addition, animal model studies, particularly in the RCS rat, have shown that restoring MerTK signaling through approaches that mimic Gas6 action leads to the preservation of photoreceptor layers—a key indicator of potential visual benefit in dry AMD.

• Anti-inflammatory Action:
Given that chronic inflammation exacerbates the progression of dry AMD, the ability of Gas6 to promote the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and to suppress Toll-like receptor-driven pro-inflammatory signals is highly advantageous. This dual activity not only addresses the impaired phagocytic function of RPE cells but also modulates the immune environment to prevent further damage (Yefimova et al., 2021, pp. 21–23).

• Genetic and Physiological Validation:
The genetic basis of MerTK dysfunction in retinal degenerative diseases provides a strong foundational rationale for targeting this pathway. The fact that MerTK mutations are directly linked to human conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa underscores the critical role of its signaling axis in retinal integrity (Yefimova et al., 2021, pp. 3–5).

Despite these noteworthy strengths, several challenges remain that must be addressed in the development program:

• Clinical Translation Gap:
While the preclinical and in vitro data are compelling, recombinant human Gas6 has not yet been extensively evaluated in clinical trials focused specifically on dry AMD. Extrapolating efficacy from animal models to human patients may encounter challenges due to differences in retinal architecture, immune responses, and disease heterogeneity. Early-phase clinical studies will be needed to validate safety and to confirm that the robust efficacy seen in preclinical models translates to human retinal tissue (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

• Delivery and Pharmacokinetics:
As a recombinant protein, Gas6 must be delivered in a manner that ensures its stability, persistence, and targeted delivery to RPE cells. Subretinal or intravitreal injection are the most likely routes; however, these methods have inherent technical challenges related to the invasiveness of the procedure, the potential for immunogenicity, and issues with achieving sustained therapeutic levels in the eye. Optimizing the formulation, dose frequency, and delivery devices will be critical to overcome these barriers (King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, 2011).

• Long-term Safety and Immunogenicity:
Protein therapeutics are associated with potential risks including the generation of anti-drug antibodies, which can reduce efficacy or trigger adverse immune responses. Long-term ocular safety data, particularly in the context of repeated dosing, will be essential to ensuring that recombinant Gas6 does not inadvertently induce local inflammation or toxicity in the sensitive retinal environment.

• Complexity of Dry AMD Pathogenesis:
Dry AMD is a multifactorial disorder with contributions from oxidative stress, complement dysregulation, genetic predispositions, and metabolic imbalances. While enhancing RPE phagocytosis and suppressing inflammation addresses two key aspects of the disease, it remains to be determined whether modulating a single signaling pathway will yield sufficient therapeutic benefit on its own. There is a strong case for considering recombinant human Gas6 as part of a broader combinatorial approach to dry AMD.

• Manufacturing and Regulatory Considerations:
The production of a biologic such as recombinant human Gas6 requires adherence to strict manufacturing controls to ensure bioactivity and reproducibility. Regulatory pathways for new ocular biologics can be complex, requiring extensive preclinical toxicology studies and robust clinical proof of concept before approval, particularly in a disease area with no current approved treatments for the dry form.

Overall, recombinant human Gas6 represents a strong candidate for further exploration as a therapeutic intervention for dry AMD. Its mechanism of action is well supported by both genetic and biochemical studies, and its ability to enhance LC3-associated phagocytosis combined with anti-inflammatory signaling directly addresses central aspects of RPE dysfunction in this disease. In vitro data showing substantial improvements in MerTK phosphorylation and POS uptake, along with promising preclinical animal model findings, provide a solid rationale for advancing this candidate into early-phase clinical studies. Nevertheless, the challenges associated with protein delivery, long-term safety, and the complex pathogenesis of dry AMD suggest that additional optimization and combination strategies may ultimately be necessary for maximal therapeutic benefit.

In conclusion, recombinant human Gas6 leverages a highly promising endogenous pathway—namely, the Gas6/MerTK signaling axis—to restore RPE phagocytic function and modulate inflammatory responses that are critically impaired in dry AMD. Its biologically defined mechanism, strong preclinical efficacy data as demonstrated by improvements in MerTK phosphorylation and photoreceptor outer segment clearance, and potential to shift the ocular cytokine milieu toward a reparative state make it a candidate of significant interest for further development. However, the success of this approach will depend on overcoming delivery challenges, establishing a favorable safety profile in the ocular setting, and integrating this intervention into a broader therapeutic strategy that addresses the multifactorial nature of dry AMD. Given the dearth of effective treatments for the dry form of AMD and the clear need for therapies that can preserve vision and retinal integrity, the further investigation of recombinant human Gas6 is both scientifically and clinically justified (Yefimova et al., 2021, pp. 13–15, 21–23; Singh, 2013, pp. 37–40; King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

SkQ1 (Visomitin; Plantex),"Proposal for SkQ1 (Visomitin; Plantex)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SkQ1, also known as Visomitin or Plantex, is a synthetic mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant developed as 10-(6′-plastoquinonyl) decyltriphenylphosphonium. Its design couples a potent antioxidant moiety derived from plastoquinone with a lipophilic, positively charged triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation that drives its selective accumulation into the mitochondrial inner membrane. This chemical framework places SkQ1 in the class of mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants (MTAs), a group of compounds engineered expressly to concentrate at the primary site of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This class of compounds has been widely investigated and applied in animal models of aging and neurodegeneration, and has even been formulated for clinical use; for example, SkQ1 has been approved in Russia as Visomitin eye drops for ocular indications, and its underlying mode of action is predicated on neutralizing ROS directly at their site of origin. The origins of SkQ1 are rooted in research aimed at mitigating mitochondrial oxidative damage—a key factor in age‐related cellular dysfunction—with its discovery emerging from innovative approaches to disrupt the aging program at the subcellular level (Markovets, Fursova, & Kolosova, 2011; Perepechaeva, Grishanova, Rudnitskaya, & Kolosova, 2014).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, SkQ1 has been studied extensively in both preclinical and early clinical settings. Preclinical studies have used senescence‐accelerated animal models such as the OXYS rat, which exhibits retinal pathology that mimics features of dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD). In these models, SkQ1 administration—whether by oral supplementation or as topical eye drops—has demonstrated an ability to prevent or even reverse retinal degenerative changes by restoring angiogenic factor balance (e.g., normalizing VEGF and PEDF expression) and preserving retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) integrity (Markovets, Fursova, & Kolosova, 2011; Muraleva et al., 2014). Clinically, while many of the human studies have focused on ocular surface disorders, SkQ1 has been evaluated in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials for dry eye syndrome (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018, 2019). Although there is limited direct clinical trial data in patients with dry AMD to date, the use of SkQ1 in conditions with shared pathomechanisms (i.e., oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction) provides an encouraging foundation for repurposing SkQ1 to manage retinal degenerative diseases. Additionally, the veterinary and experimental evidence that demonstrates improvement in retinal structure and function with SkQ1 treatment supports its potential utility in AMD, an area where current antioxidant strategies have had mixed results (Markovets, Fursova, & Kolosova, 2011; Muraleva et al., 2014).

Mechanism of Action:
SkQ1’s mechanism of action is rooted in its capacity to selectively traverse biological membranes and accumulate specifically in the mitochondrial inner membrane due to the negative membrane potential present within mitochondria. Once inside, SkQ1 acts as a potent scavenger of mitochondrial ROS, thereby neutralizing lipid peroxides and other free radicals produced by mitochondrial electron transport chain activity. The reduction of oxidative stress prevents cascade signaling that typically culminates in mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular degeneration. There is evidence from preclinical studies that SkQ1 not only neutralizes ROS but also influences multiple intracellular signaling pathways – notably by normalizing the expression of angiogenesis modulators such as VEGF and PEDF, and by restoring the levels of protective chaperone proteins like αB-crystallin, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis in RPE cells (Markovets et al., 2011; Muraleva et al., 2014). Beyond its antioxidant activity, SkQ1 appears to have indirect effects on cellular clearance mechanisms: by protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage, it helps preserve lysosomal integrity and the cytoskeletal structures required for effective phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) via receptor systems such as MerTK/αvβ5. In addition, by quenching mitochondrial ROS, SkQ1 may diminish the activation of redox-sensitive inflammatory cascades including the NLRP3 inflammasome, a complex known to be triggered by mitochondrial damage and a contributor to chronic inflammation in AMD (Muraleva, Zhdankina, Fursova, & Kolosova, 2024; Kyosseva, 2016). Biochemical studies further indicate that by preventing A2E photooxidation—a process that leads to the accumulation of toxic bisretinoids in the RPE—SkQ1 may impede one of the major drivers of lipofuscin buildup and subsequent lysosomal and cellular dysfunction (Muraleva et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry age-related macular degeneration, the expected cellular and tissue effects of SkQ1 are multifaceted. The candidate drug is anticipated to localize preferentially to RPE mitochondria, where it will neutralize mitochondrial ROS and lipid peroxides, thereby preventing the oxidative damage that compromises RPE cell viability and function. By quenching mitochondrial ROS, SkQ1 is expected to block the oxidative mechanisms underlying A2E photooxidation; this in turn will help preserve lysosomal integrity—a critical aspect since lysosomal dysfunction is linked to impaired phagocytosis of POS, a process that, when disrupted, contributes to photoreceptor degeneration and disease progression in AMD (Muraleva, Zhdankina, Fursova, & Kolosova, 2024; Markovets et al., 2011). Moreover, by reducing ROS, SkQ1 should indirectly ameliorate the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a central participant in the inflammatory responses associated with AMD pathogenesis. This effect is expected to temper downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine release and contribute to a reduction in chronic retinal inflammation. On a molecular level, the improved mitochondrial dynamics and a more robust autophagic flux that are anticipated as a consequence of SkQ1 treatment would support proper phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor debris. Given the expression of key proteins involved in mitochondrial quality control and autophagy—such as PGC-1α and Nrf2—in RPE cells, SkQ1’s action might enhance these protective pathways, further stabilizing the cellular environment against stress-induced damage (Markovets et al., 2011; Muraleva, Zhdankina, Fursova, & Kolosova, 2024). Collectively, these effects should culminate in preserved retinal structure and function, slowing or halting the progression of dry AMD by maintaining the critical balance between oxidative damage and cellular repair mechanisms.

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, SkQ1 presents as an intriguing and promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration based on its unique chemical properties and documented preclinical efficacy in models of oxidative stress-driven retinal degeneration. Among its principal strengths is its chemical specificity: SkQ1’s design allows it to accumulate selectively in mitochondria, the epicenter of ROS production in RPE cells, thereby providing a targeted approach that supersedes the generalized effects of systemic antioxidants. The preclinical data from OXYS rat models demonstrate that SkQ1 effectively mitigates retinal degeneration by modulating key pathogenic factors such as VEGF/PEDF gene expression and by restoring levels of neuroprotective proteins like αB-crystallin (Markovets et al., 2011; Muraleva et al., 2014). Furthermore, clinical trials in ocular surface disorders have established a favorable safety profile for topical SkQ1 formulations, which supports its potential repurposing for AMD despite the current lack of dedicated AMD clinical trials. The compound’s ability to preempt mitochondrial dysfunction, reduce lipid peroxidation, diminish ROS-triggered NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and indirectly enhance autophagic flux and phagocytosis of POS are critical molecular mechanisms that align well with the current understanding of dry AMD pathogenesis (Muraleva, Zhdankina, Fursova, & Kolosova, 2024; Unknown Reference).

However, several challenges remain. Despite promising preclinical findings, direct evidence supporting SkQ1’s efficacy specifically in dry AMD—in human clinical trials or robust retinal models beyond the OXYS rat—is still limited. Moreover, while the mechanistic hypothesis is compelling, detailed studies are warranted to elucidate SkQ1’s effect on specific molecular targets, such as the inhibition of A2E photooxidation and the precise modulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activity in RPE cells. Optimal dosing regimens, treatment duration, and potential long-term toxicities also require further careful investigation. Furthermore, while similar mitochondrial antioxidants have shown benefits in ocular tissues (as evidenced by studies on MitoQ, SS peptides, and other TPP-linked compounds), the comparative advantage of SkQ1 over these compounds in the context of AMD remains to be fully established (Perepechaeva, Grishanova, Rudnitskaya, & Kolosova, 2014; Kim, Kim, Yang, & Kim, 2021). Lastly, repurposing a drug primarily approved for dry eye syndrome for AMD will necessitate extensive translational research to bridge the gap between its current indications and the complex, multifactorial pathology of dry AMD. Nonetheless, the hypothesis that SkQ1 will preserve mitochondrial dynamics, reduce oxidative damage and inflammation, and maintain RPE phagocytic function is well supported by available biochemical and preclinical evidence, indicating that further research—both in advanced cellular models and in dedicated clinical trials—is warranted (ClinicalTrials.gov; Markovets et al., 2011; Muraleva et al., 2014).

In conclusion, SkQ1 offers a targeted, mitochondria-focused therapeutic approach that addresses fundamental aspects of dry AMD pathogenesis. Its strengths lie in its precise mechanism of action at the mitochondrial level, its demonstrated ability to modulate critical oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways, and its established clinical safety in related ocular conditions. Although further research is needed to specifically validate its efficacy in dry AMD—including direct evaluations of its effects on NLRP3 activation, A2E photooxidation, and RPE clearance functions—the current body of evidence supports continued investigation of SkQ1 as a viable repurposed candidate for mitigating the progression of dry AMD (Muraleva, Zhdankina, Fursova, & Kolosova, 2024; Markovets et al., 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov).

Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA),"Proposal for Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is a naturally occurring bile acid derivative that belongs to the class of chemical chaperones. It is formed by the conjugation of taurine to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a bile acid originally discovered in animal bile – historically, bear bile was used in traditional Chinese medicine. TUDCA is synthesized either via extraction from animal bile or through contemporary chemical synthesis, and its hydrophilic properties (molecular formula C26H45NO6S, molecular weight approximately 499.7) render it highly biocompatible. As a member of the bile acid family, TUDCA has been extensively studied for its cytoprotective, anti-apoptotic, and chemical chaperone activities (Kusaczuk, 2019). This class of compounds is well known for their roles in improving protein folding homeostasis, particularly by modulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) and alleviating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Its use in traditional practices coupled with modern mechanistic insights has seen TUDCA repurposed for conditions as diverse as cholestatic liver diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and, more recently, retinal degenerative conditions (Song et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, TUDCA and its parent compound UDCA have been utilized in both clinical and veterinary settings for hepatic disorders, including primary biliary cholangitis and other forms of cholestasis, where they promote bile flow and protect hepatocytes from bile acid–induced apoptosis. Over the past few decades, extensive research has expanded the therapeutic applications of TUDCA to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease owing to its ability to stabilize mitochondrial function, reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and prevent apoptotic cascades in neuronal cells (Vang et al., 2014). Animal studies have provided strong evidence that TUDCA can reduce markers of ER stress and consequently diminish apoptosis. In models of retinal degeneration – including retinitis pigmentosa, retinal detachment, and other forms of retinal injury – TUDCA has been shown to protect photoreceptors and preserve retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell function. Studies using rodent models indicate that TUDCA decreases photoreceptor apoptosis and preserves overall retinal architecture (Drack et al., 2012; Alhasani et al., 2020). Although clinical trials have extensively evaluated TUDCA in hepatic and neurodegenerative conditions, there is no registered clinical study directly investigating TUDCA for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or related retinal degenerative diseases in humans, despite the enormous number of trials exploring bile acids in ocular applications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nonetheless, preclinical evidence in retinal models provides a promising rationale for its repurposing in dry AMD, where chronic ER stress and impaired autophagy are key pathological features.

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mode of action of TUDCA is its function as a chemical chaperone, where it assists in the correct folding of nascent proteins and reduces the accumulation of misfolded or aggregated proteins in the ER. Under conditions of cellular stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated, and prolonged ER stress is a well‐recognized contributor to cellular dysfunction in the retina, particularly in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in dry AMD. TUDCA has been shown to stabilize protein conformation and downregulate key UPR markers such as BiP (Binding immunoglobulin Protein) and CHOP (C/EBP Homologous Protein), which are mediators of ER stress-induced apoptosis (Kusaczuk, 2019; Alhasani et al., 2020). By modulating these stress response pathways, TUDCA restores proteostasis, thereby promoting cell survival.

Beyond its role in alleviating ER stress, TUDCA has been documented to enhance autophagic flux. The autophagy-lysosome pathway is critical for the clearance of damaged organelles and aggregated proteins, including the photoreceptor outer segments (POS) that accumulate in RPE cells in dry AMD. TUDCA is proposed to upregulate the expression of lysosome-associated genes via activation of transcription factors such as ATF6, leading to increased levels of autophagy markers like LC3-II. Experimental evidence demonstrates that in primary AMD RPE cultures, treatment with 100 μM TUDCA leads to a significant reduction in CHOP expression (approximately 60% reduction) and a twofold increase in LC3-II levels as well as an improvement in FITC-POS phagocytosis by 35% (Alhasani et al., 2020). Such modulation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway is crucial for effective degradation of POS and may mitigate the lipofuscin accumulation seen in dry AMD. Additionally, TUDCA’s impact on mitochondrial stabilization is also notable; it mitigates apoptosis by preventing mitochondrial depolarization, Bax translocation, ROS generation, and cytochrome c release, further contributing to its overall cytoprotective profile (Vang et al., 2014; Boatright et al., 2019).

At the molecular level, TUDCA interacts with several cellular receptors. It has been reported to bind to nuclear steroid receptors (NSRs), facilitating their dissociation from heat shock proteins and subsequent nuclear translocation, where they can modulate gene expression related to apoptosis (Vang et al., 2014). Furthermore, it may interact with G protein-coupled bile acid receptor TGR5 (GPBAR1), which is expressed in retinal ganglion cells and possibly in RPE cells, to mediate anti-inflammatory responses via increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Such receptor-mediated actions add another dimension to its neuroprotective effects by reducing inflammation in the retinal microenvironment.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis under evaluation is that TUDCA will alleviate ER stress in RPE cells, restore proteostasis, and enhance the function of the autophagy-lysosome pathway to improve the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) in dry AMD. In vitro assays using primary AMD RPE cultures have preliminarily shown that treatment with TUDCA at a concentration of 100 μM results in a marked reduction in ER stress marker CHOP by 60% and an increase in LC3-II by 2-fold, which correlates with improved phagocytosis of FITC-labeled POS by 35% (Alhasani et al., 2020). This suggests that TUDCA enhances the degradative capacity of RPE cells, which is pivotal because impaired POS clearance is believed to contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of dry AMD through accumulation of toxic protein aggregates and subsequent RPE dysfunction.

On the molecular side, the expected beneficial effects are supported by TUDCA’s documented ability to stabilize protein folding and reduce unfolded protein response (UPR) activation, which in turn alleviates chronic ER stress—a key factor driving lysosomal dysfunction in RPE cells (Kusaczuk, 2019; Boatright et al., 2019). Additionally, by promoting autophagic flux, TUDCA is expected to improve the turnover and clearance of damaged proteins and organelles, thereby restoring cellular homeostasis. This is critical for maintaining photoreceptor health because the RPE not only serves as a support cell layer that provides metabolic and phagocytic support to photoreceptors but also plays a crucial role in preventing toxic build-up within the retinal environment. Expression profiling in RPE cells confirms that key autophagy genes and UPR-related genes, such as ATF6, BiP, and CHOP, are modulated under stress conditions, and TUDCA’s action appears to impact these pathways beneficially (Alhasani et al., 2020; Boatright et al., 2019).

Furthermore, animal models of retinal degeneration have shown that systemic administration of TUDCA decreases the apoptotic indices in photoreceptors, leading to preservation of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and overall retinal architecture (Drack et al., 2012; Boatright et al., 2019). The expected effect in dry AMD would similarly be a reduction in photoreceptor loss, maintained RPE structure, and overall improved visual function over time. Because dry AMD is characterized by gradual degeneration of photoreceptors and RPE cells due in part to impaired clearance mechanisms, a compound such as TUDCA that can directly modulate these cellular processes is highly relevant.

Overall Evaluation:
TUDCA emerges as an attractive and mechanism-specific therapeutic candidate for dry AMD based on its multifaceted actions that directly address key pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in the disease. One major strength of TUDCA is its dual action as a chemical chaperone and modulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway, which positions it to alleviate chronic ER stress and restore normal protein homeostasis in RPE cells. Preclinical studies have robustly demonstrated that TUDCA reduces ER stress markers (notably CHOP) and enhances autophagic flux (as evidenced by increased LC3-II levels), leading to improved clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (Alhasani et al., 2020). These mechanistic actions are particularly promising in the context of dry AMD, where lipofuscin accumulation and other byproducts of impaired degradation pathways are central to disease progression. Moreover, TUDCA’s previously documented safety profile in hepatic and neurodegenerative studies represents a substantial advantage when considering repurposing for ocular indications; safety is especially critical in chronic diseases such as dry AMD where long-term treatment would be necessary.

However, there are also weaknesses and challenges to consider. Although extensive preclinical data in animal models support TUDCA’s cytoprotective effects, direct clinical evidence in patients with dry AMD is currently lacking. The large number of clinical trials involving TUDCA in other indications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) underscores the interest in bile acid therapeutics, yet the translation of these findings to the specific context of dry AMD remains to be fully validated. Another potential weakness is the need to establish optimal dosing and ocular pharmacokinetics specifically in the retina. While in vitro studies in primary RPE cultures have shown promising effects at 100 μM, it is essential to determine whether similar concentrations can be achieved in vivo in the retina without adverse effects. Furthermore, while TUDCA is known to modulate ER stress and autophagy pathways, these processes are inherently complex and may vary significantly between model systems and human pathology. Therefore, further validation in translational models that closely mimic human dry AMD is imperative.

In summary, the strengths of TUDCA lie in its well-characterized mechanism of enhancing proteostasis by reducing ER stress and promoting autophagic clearance, its proven neuroprotective effects in retinal and other neurodegenerative models, and its established safety profile in clinical studies for other diseases (Vang et al., 2014; Drack et al., 2012). These attributes strongly support its potential as a repurposed therapeutic agent for dry AMD, where RPE dysfunction due to chronic ER stress and impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments is a key pathological feature. On the other hand, the lack of direct clinical data in dry AMD patients, uncertainties regarding appropriate dosing for ocular delivery, and the complexity of the underlying disease mechanisms are challenges that must be addressed in future research. Overall, TUDCA represents a promising candidate that merits further investigation in focused preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials to determine its efficacy in rescuing RPE clearance capacity and preserving retinal structure and function in dry AMD patients (Kusaczuk, 2019; Alhasani et al., 2020; Drack et al., 2012; Vang et al., 2014).

Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera),"Proposal for Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), marketed as Tecfidera®, is a synthetic fumaric acid ester derived from the natural intermediate fumaric acid, which is a key metabolite in the citric acid cycle. The chemical modifications introduced in its synthesis yield an electrophilic compound capable of engaging in Michael addition reactions with thiol groups on proteins. This class of compounds is defined by its α,β-unsaturated carbonyl structure, which imparts reactivity towards nucleophilic amino acid residues—most notably, the cysteine residues on Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) (Cho et al., 2015). Historically, fumaric acid esters including DMF have been used in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Their clinical utility in these indications is largely attributed to their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. DMF is rapidly converted in vivo to its primary active metabolite, monomethyl fumarate (MMF), which mediates the majority of its biological effects (Manai & Amadio, 2022). The discovery of DMF’s capacity to modulate the immune system while simultaneously reducing oxidative stress laid the groundwork for exploring its potential application in chronic, degenerative conditions. In recent years, evidence has accumulated that suggests these same mechanisms may be therapeutically beneficial in ocular degenerations such as dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), where oxidative damage, inflammation, and autophagic dysfunction play central roles in disease progression (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Manai et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History
DMF has an extensive history of use as an immunomodulatory agent in neuroinflammatory and dermatological diseases. Its approval for treating relapsing–remitting MS is a testament to its long-term tolerability and consistent efficacy in reducing inflammatory damage via activation of antioxidant pathways (Sheremata et al., 2015). Clinical studies in MS have demonstrated that chronic administration of DMF is associated with a manageable safety profile, predominantly characterized by gastrointestinal side effects that are transient and controllable (Larabee, 2019). Although DMF was never specifically approved for dry AMD, its use in MS has generated a wealth of clinical data regarding its pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and overall tolerability that is directly relevant to populations with chronic degenerative disorders. Preclinical work in retinal models further supports its potential utility. Studies conducted on retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells exposed to blue light have shown that DMF effectively reduces oxidative damage through activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Shimizu et al., 2022). Ongoing clinical investigations, such as the study registered under NCT04292080 (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022) and clinical‐trial database searches (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), specifically assess the long-term effects of DMF in patients with geographic atrophy—a late-stage manifestation of dry AMD—providing an important translational bridge between the established clinical use in MS and the retinal disease context (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additional support comes from studies in diabetic retinopathy and retinal ischemia–reperfusion models, which indicate that DMF’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects extend to a variety of retinal pathologies that share mechanistic overlaps with dry AMD (Giunta et al., 2023; Larabee, 2019).

Mechanism of Action
The primary mode of action of DMF is its activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is bound in the cytoplasm by Keap1, which facilitates its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. DMF acts as an electrophilic agent and, upon conversion to monomethyl fumarate, covalently modifies critical cysteine residues on Keap1. These modifications lead to a conformational change in Keap1 that impairs its ability to target Nrf2 for degradation. Consequently, stabilized Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus where it binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of several cytoprotective genes (Cho et al., 2015; Manai et al., 2022). The genes upregulated by Nrf2 include those encoding key antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), and superoxide dismutase (SOD1), as well as enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis. The increased expression of these enzymes enhances the cell’s ability to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintain redox homeostasis (Manai et al., 2022; Shimizu et al., 2022).

Beyond its canonical role in redox regulation, Nrf2 activation has been implicated in modulating autophagy, a vital cellular process that degrades damaged proteins and organelles. Nrf2 can upregulate the expression of p62/SQSTM1, a key autophagic adaptor protein that binds ubiquitinated proteins and facilitates their delivery to autophagosomes. In the context of RPE cells—which bear a high metabolic load due to the daily phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS)—the maintenance of autophagic flux and proper lysosomal function is crucial for cell survival. The activation of Nrf2, therefore, contributes dual benefits by both enhancing antioxidant defenses and potentially promoting autophagic clearance mechanisms that are often impaired in dry AMD (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Manai et al., 2022).

In addition to the activation of Nrf2, DMF has been shown to downregulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). By dampening these inflammatory mediators, DMF further contributes to the resolution of oxidative injury. In retinal models, such as those assessing blue light–induced damage in RPE cells, DMF has been observed to reduce cytokine expression and mitigate cell death (Shimizu et al., 2022; Shu et al., 2022). The combined antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of DMF are therefore highly suited for addressing the multifactorial pathology of dry AMD, where both oxidative stress and chronic inflammation drive retinal degeneration.

Expected Effect
In the context of dry AMD, the hypothesis is that DMF will activate the Nrf2 pathway in RPE cells, thereby reducing ROS-induced lysosomal dysfunction and restoring autophagic flux. RPE cells in dry AMD exhibit significant oxidative damage, which impairs their ability to clear POS, leads to the accumulation of cellular debris, and promotes inflammation. Preclinical studies in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–RPE models have demonstrated that exposure to oxidative stress impairs autophagic function, as evidenced by reduced LC3-II formation and a failure to efficiently clear labeled POS. Treatment with DMF has been observed to restore autophagic flux by increasing LC3-II levels and promoting the clearance of POS by approximately 35% compared to untreated controls (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Cho et al., 2015). This restoration is critical: by enhancing autophagy, DMF not only clears accumulated photoreceptor debris but also reduces the formation of drusen, a hallmark of dry AMD, and creates a cellular environment more conducive to RPE survival.

Furthermore, pharmacokinetic studies in rodent models have demonstrated that following oral administration, DMF or its active metabolite achieves sufficient retinal penetration to modulate the intracellular environments of RPE cells (Manai & Amadio, 2022). Such data suggest that DMF, when dosed appropriately, can reach the therapeutic concentrations necessary to activate the Nrf2 pathway within the retina. Reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to DMF further supports the expected outcome of decreased inflammation, thereby improving the overall health and function of the retinal tissue (Shu et al., 2022).

The expected effects of DMF in assays using patient-derived iPSC-RPE cells include a robust increase in nuclear Nrf2 translocation, upregulation of ARE-driven antioxidant genes, restoration of autophagic markers such as LC3-II, and enhanced clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. Collectively, these molecular and cellular improvements are anticipated to counteract the pathological processes that underlie dry AMD by lowering intracellular ROS levels, preserving lysosomal function, and reducing chronic inflammation. Such improvements should ultimately contribute to the stabilization or even improvement of visual function in patients with dry AMD, where current therapeutic options remain limited (Manai et al., 2022; Catanzaro et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation
From an expert drug development perspective, DMF represents a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD due to its dual function of activating antioxidant defenses and restoring autophagic function in retinal pigment epithelial cells. One of the major strengths of DMF lies in its well-characterized mechanism of action: by modifying Keap1 and stabilizing Nrf2, DMF upregulates key antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1, NQO1, and SOD1. This not only helps in neutralizing reactive oxygen species in the high-oxygen environment of the retina but also contributes to re-establishing the cellular homeostasis necessary for effective autophagic clearance (Cho et al., 2015; Catanzaro et al., 2020).

The clinical history of DMF in MS and psoriasis provides additional assurance regarding its safety and tolerability. The extensive clinical experience—with observed chronic tolerability and a manageable side-effect profile—supports its feasibility for long-term use in an elderly patient population that typically characterizes those with dry AMD (Sheremata et al., 2015; Larabee, 2019). Moreover, the ongoing clinical trial NCT04292080 (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022) is designed to evaluate DMF in patients with geographic atrophy, offering the first direct clinical insight into its efficacy in the context of retinal degeneration (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022).

Preclinical data derived from RPE cell models further bolster DMF’s candidacy. In vitro studies have consistently shown that DMF restores autophagic flux in RPE cells, as indicated by increased LC3-II formation and enhanced clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. Given that impaired autophagy and lysosomal dysfunction are central to the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates and debris in dry AMD, DMF’s ability to improve these cellular processes is particularly compelling (Manai et al., 2022; Cho et al., 2015).

In addition, the anti-inflammatory effects of DMF—through the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6—provide a further avenue by which this compound may confer protection in the retinal environment. Chronic inflammation is a known driver of RPE degeneration and photoreceptor loss in dry AMD, and by mitigating this inflammatory milieu, DMF can contribute to slowing disease progression (Shu et al., 2022).

Nevertheless, there are weaknesses and challenges that must be addressed before DMF can be definitively validated for dry AMD. While preclinical studies in RPE and retinal models are promising, direct clinical evidence in dry AMD patients is still in its infancy. The outcomes from the ongoing clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022) will be critical in determining not only the efficacy of DMF in halting AMD progression but also its long-term safety in an elderly and potentially metabolically compromised population.
Another potential challenge involves the question of retinal pharmacokinetics. Although rodent studies indicate that DMF achieves sufficient retinal penetration following oral dosing, species-specific differences in drug distribution and metabolism may impact the translation of these findings to human subjects. Detailed ADME studies in humans, especially in the context of an aging retina with altered blood–retinal barrier permeability, will be essential to ensure that adequate therapeutic levels of DMF can be sustained in the RPE (Manai & Amadio, 2022).

Furthermore, while the mechanistic rationale for improved autophagic flux is supported by increased LC3-II formation and enhanced POS clearance in vitro, the in vivo complexity of autophagy regulation may present unexpected hurdles. The exact molecular interactions between Nrf2 activation and the autophagic machinery in RPE cells under chronic oxidative stress require further elucidation. It will be necessary to determine whether DMF can consistently induce these effects in the human retinal microenvironment and remain effective over prolonged treatment durations (Manai et al., 2022; Shimizu et al., 2022).

Additionally, although DMF’s anti-inflammatory effects are well documented—with reductions in cytokine expression and beneficial modulation of immune cell activity—the long-term consequences of chronic immune modulation in the retina are not fully understood. The retina is an immune-privileged tissue, and interventions that alter local immune responses must be carefully balanced to avoid unforeseen complications such as impaired response to infections or dysregulation of tissue repair mechanisms (Larabee, 2019).

Finally, even if DMF successfully reduces oxidative stress and improves autophagic clearance in vitro, the ultimate goal is to achieve visual preservation and functional improvement in patients with dry AMD. Clinical endpoints in AMD trials, such as changes in visual acuity and retinal morphology assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT), will be essential to establish whether the molecular benefits observed translate into meaningful clinical outcomes (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022).

In summary, the repurposing of DMF for dry AMD is supported by a robust body of biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature. Its dual mechanism—centering on Nrf2 activation to enhance antioxidant defenses and restore autophagic homeostasis—is well aligned with the known pathophysiology of dry AMD, where oxidative stress and impaired clearance of photoreceptor debris contribute to RPE degeneration. The established clinical safety profile of DMF in multiple sclerosis and psoriasis provides a significant advantage in terms of risk management, and preliminary in vitro data in RPE models further reinforce its potential therapeutic effect. Ongoing clinical trials targeting advanced stages of dry AMD (such as geographic atrophy) will be pivotal in confirming its efficacy in the target population. However, additional investigations are needed to fully understand the human retinal pharmacokinetics of DMF, its long-term impacts on autophagy and immune function in the retina, and ultimately whether these molecular benefits will translate into sustained visual improvement for patients.

From a drug development standpoint, DMF represents an attractive candidate for repurposing in dry AMD due to the convergence of its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and potential autophagy-restorative effects. Its mechanism of action—with a focus on modifying Keap1 to stabilize and activate Nrf2—directly targets the oxidative and autophagic disturbances that underlie dry AMD pathology. The positive preclinical findings, in combination with a well-characterized clinical safety record, justify further investment in controlled clinical studies. If these studies confirm its efficacy and safety in the setting of dry AMD, DMF could fill a critical unmet need in a patient population for which there are currently limited treatment options. Overall, despite some translational challenges and the need for additional mechanistic clarity, DMF holds considerable promise as a repurposed therapeutic for dry AMD, meriting continued research and development efforts (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Manai et al., 2022; Giunta et al., 2023; Shimizu et al., 2022).

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA),"Proposal for Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a naturally occurring long‐chain omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that was originally identified and isolated from fish oil and marine algae; its discovery followed extensive biochemical research into essential fatty acids required for neural and retinal development (Bazan, Molina, & Gordon, 2011). DHA belongs to the class of omega‐3 fatty acids, which are critical structural components of cell membranes, particularly in the central nervous system and the retina, where they contribute to membrane fluidity, receptor organization, and intracellular signaling (Bazan et al., 2011). Broadly, omega‐3 fatty acids have been used for centuries as nutritional supplements to maintain cardiovascular, neurological, and ocular health, and DHA in particular has been shown to play a pivotal role in neuroprotection and cell survival, a profile that has generated interest in using it as a therapeutic candidate for neurodegenerative conditions (Lawrenson & Evans, 2015). Its natural origin from fish oil – available commercially as purified or concentrated formulations such as Sigma-Aldrich catalog #50692 – and its well‐characterized safety profile have made DHA a leading candidate for repurposing to treat dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) through enhancement of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) function and photoreceptor survival (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
DHA has a rich therapeutic history, with extensive use and investigation in both clinical and preclinical settings. Historically, DHA supplementation has been explored in ophthalmology for retinal degenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), as evidenced by clinical trials including NCT00060749, NCT00100230, and the AREDS2 study (National Eye Institute, 2003; Hoffman, 2004; National Eye Institute, 2006). In addition to its use in human clinical studies, DHA has also been administered in veterinary contexts where its importance in retinal development and neuroprotection has been highlighted, demonstrating preservation of photoreceptor structure and function in animal models fed omega-3 enriched diets (Tuo et al., 2009). Preclinical studies in murine models – such as those using Ccl2/Cx3cr1-deficient mice that mimic features of AMD – have demonstrated that diets enriched with DHA result in improved RPE phagocytosis, reduced accumulation of toxic lipofuscin derivatives like A2E, and a slowing of photoreceptor degeneration (Ramkumar et al., 2013; Tuo et al., 2009). While most clinical evidence in AMD populations is indirect, epidemiological studies and observational data from trials like AREDS2 suggest that higher dietary intakes of DHA correlate with reduced progression of dry AMD, supporting the hypothesis that DHA supplementation may yield benefits in this patient population (Lee, Lee, Zhang, & Zhou, 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, DHA’s mechanism of action is multifaceted and centers on its incorporation into cell membranes, where it modulates lipid raft microdomains and the function of key receptor proteins. Biochemically, DHA is esterified at the sn-2 position of phospholipids and becomes a critical part of the RPE cell membrane; its unique physical properties contribute to increased membrane fluidity and the formation of specialized lipid domains necessary for receptor clustering (Bazan et al., 2011). This remodeling of the membrane is hypothesized to enhance the activity of receptor tyrosine kinases such as MerTK, which are essential for the phagocytic uptake of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by RPE cells. In vitro studies have shown that when RPE cell cultures are supplemented with DHA at concentrations of 50 μM, there is a notable increase of approximately 60% in MerTK phosphorylation at tyrosine residue Y749, which is critical for initiating intracellular signaling cascades that promote efficient phagocytosis (Bazan et al., 2011). This receptor activation is facilitated by the interaction with Gas6, a ligand that binds MerTK to trigger its clustering within DHA-rich membrane domains, thereby accelerating the internalization of POS by 35% as measured by assays employing FITC-labeled POS (Bazan et al., 2011). Beyond receptor activation, DHA also serves as a substrate for the production of bioactive mediators, such as neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), which has potent anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects; NPD1 has been shown to upregulate antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) and downregulate proapoptotic proteins in RPE cells under oxidative stress, further contributing to retinal protection (Bazan et al., 2011). Additionally, DHA’s incorporation into RPE membranes is linked to enhanced phagolysosome trafficking, facilitating the degradation and clearance of accumulated POS debris; this process is critical because defective phagocytosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of dry AMD through the buildup of toxic cellular waste products that can lead to photoreceptor degeneration (Kaarniranta et al., 2019). Collectively, these mechanistic insights explain how DHA not only structurally integrates into retinal membranes but also biochemically orchestrates intracellular signaling events that support RPE health and photoreceptor viability.

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay, DHA supplementation is expected to yield measurable improvements in RPE phagocytic function through both receptor activation and intracellular trafficking enhancements. Specifically, the hypothesis posits that adding DHA to RPE cell cultures at 50 μM will result in enhanced clustering of MerTK receptors in lipid raft domains, leading to a 60% increase in MerTK Y749 phosphorylation; this is known to be a critical modification that triggers downstream signaling pathways necessary for efficient phagocytosis (Bazan et al., 2011). As a result, a 35% increase in FITC-POS internalization is anticipated, which reflects improved uptake of photoreceptor outer segments by RPE cells; this effect is further expected to be accompanied by accelerated phagolysosome trafficking, ensuring that internalized debris is promptly degraded and disposed of (Lee et al., 2024). Animal models of retinal degeneration – where DHA-enriched diets have been shown to reduce the accumulation of lipofuscin and preserve photoreceptor structure – lend robust preclinical support to this expected outcome (Tuo et al., 2009; Ramkumar et al., 2013). Moreover, clinical evidence from observational studies and the AREDS2 trial has linked higher dietary DHA intake with a slower progression of AMD, thereby corroborating the therapeutic rationale that improving RPE phagocytosis via DHA-mediated modulation of MerTK signaling will translate to better retinal outcomes in dry AMD patients (Lee et al., 2024; National Eye Institute, 2006). Given that RPE cells are a critical component of retinal homeostasis—responsible for the daily clearance of shed photoreceptor outer segments—the anticipated increase in phagocytic activity should help maintain photoreceptor integrity and function, ultimately reducing the degenerative changes characteristic of dry AMD (Kaarniranta et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on comprehensive literature review across biochemical, clinical, and preclinical studies, the therapeutic candidate DHA presents a promising potential for repurposing in the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration. One of the key strengths of DHA is its well-documented natural occurrence and essential role in retinal and neural health, lending inherent safety and a robust historical background in both dietary supplementation and therapeutic applications (Bazan et al., 2011; Lawrenson & Evans, 2015). The evidence supporting DHA’s mechanism of action—its capacity to incorporate into the RPE cell membranes, enhance membrane fluidity, and promote the clustering and phosphorylation of MerTK receptors—is compelling and grounded in rigorous biochemical studies (Bazan et al., 2011). Additionally, the observed increase in phagocytic uptake and accelerated lysosomal trafficking in RPE cultures supplemented with DHA underscores the direct functional benefits that can be expected from modulating this crucial receptor pathway (Bazan et al., 2011). Preclinical animal studies further bolster this candidate’s profile, demonstrating that diets enriched in DHA lead to reduced accumulation of degenerative markers such as lipofuscin and improved photoreceptor survival in models that mimic dry AMD (Tuo et al., 2009; Ramkumar et al., 2013). Moreover, epidemiological data and clinical trials such as AREDS2 indicate that higher dietary intake of DHA is associated with a reduced progression of AMD, adding an important clinical dimension to the proposed mechanism (National Eye Institute, 2006; Lee et al., 2024).

A notable strength of DHA is its dual role as an essential membrane lipid and as a precursor to bioactive signaling molecules like neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), which amplify its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. This multi-pronged mechanism not only supports photoreceptor health by enhancing the physical properties of the cell membrane but also by directly mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation in the RPE (Bazan et al., 2011). In the context of dry AMD, where RPE dysfunction and impaired phagocytosis are central to disease progression, these effects are particularly advantageous. The proposed drug candidate benefits from decades of supportive research across multiple domains; however, certain inherent weaknesses must also be acknowledged.

One potential limitation is the variability of clinical outcomes observed in trials assessing DHA supplementation for AMD, with some studies reporting mixed or inconclusive benefits when administered as part of multi-nutrient formulations (National Eye Institute, 2006; Jiang et al., 2024). This underscores the challenge of isolating the precise contribution of DHA from other components and suggests that dose optimization and patient selection may be critical determinants of efficacy. Additionally, while in vitro data and animal models provide strong mechanistic evidence, the extrapolation of these effects to human patients remains tentative pending further well-powered randomized controlled trials specifically targeting dry AMD (Ramkumar et al., 2013; Sacu, 2015). Furthermore, potential issues related to long-term bioavailability, metabolism, and the integration of DHA into the complex lipid environment of the human retina require additional scrutiny (Bazan et al., 2011).

Despite these challenges, the overall evaluation of DHA as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is positive. Its natural origin, established safety profile, and multiple converging lines of evidence—from molecular mechanistic studies to epidemiological observations—support its further investigation and development as a treatment modality aimed at preserving RPE phagocytic function and photoreceptor viability. The specific hypothesis that DHA supplementation will enhance MerTK receptor clustering and activation, leading to improved clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, is strongly backed by both in vitro data showing increased MerTK phosphorylation and corresponding functional assays of POS internalization (Bazan et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2024). In view of the progressive and currently untreatable nature of dry AMD, pursuing DHA as a repurposed drug candidate represents a rational and promising strategy that merits further clinical evaluation in well-designed, large-scale trials.

In conclusion, DHA offers a compelling therapeutic candidate for dry AMD owing to its dual function as a critical membrane lipid and a precursor to neuroprotective mediators, its capacity to modulate MerTK signaling and enhance RPE phagocytic activity, and the supportive evidence from preclinical models and clinical observational studies. Its strengths include an excellent safety record, detailed mechanistic insights, and documented beneficial effects on retinal cell health, while its weaknesses lie in the need for further clinical validation and dosage optimization. Given these considerations, DHA stands out as a promising repurposed drug candidate with the potential to address the underlying cellular dysfunctions in dry AMD, and it should be prioritized for further preclinical studies and targeted clinical trials aimed at definitively establishing its efficacy in improving retinal outcomes (Bazan et al., 2011; Georgiou, Neokleous, Nicolaou, & Sears, 2014; Sacu, 2015).

Sulforaphane,"Proposal for Sulforaphane

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate originally isolated from cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage. This compound is produced from the precursor glucoraphanin via the enzyme myrosinase during tissue damage or chewing, which explains why its levels are especially high in broccoli sprouts (Unknown Reference). Sulforaphane falls within the broader class of NRF2 inducers and indirect antioxidants, a group of naturally derived phytochemicals renowned for their chemopreventive and cytoprotective properties. Historically, this class of compounds has been used primarily in cancer chemoprevention due to their capacity to activate phase II detoxification enzymes and to modulate oxidative stress, and they have now attracted attention as potential modulators of cellular homeostasis in various chronic diseases (Liu, 2013). In addition to its natural occurrence, sulforaphane is available commercially (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich catalog #S4441) as a standardized preparation that ensures reproducible concentration and potency for pharmaceutical and research applications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of sulforaphane is marked by extensive preclinical research and several early-phase clinical studies. It has been investigated for its anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive properties in oncology, where it has demonstrated efficacy in inducing apoptosis in cancer cells and reducing the effects of chemical carcinogens (Liu, 2013). In vivo rodent studies have provided evidence that sulforaphane can reach retinal tissue via dietary dosing, suggesting its potential for ocular applications (Unknown Reference). Although clinical studies to date have primarily focused on pulmonary disease (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, 2013) and chronic kidney disease (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023) wherein sulforaphane’s ability to activate the NRF2 pathway correlates with reduced oxidative stress, its use in ophthalmology remains largely investigational (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2013). However, several peer-reviewed biochemical studies have demonstrated that sulforaphane attenuates oxidative damage to retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells by restoring antioxidant gene expression and autophagy, thereby improving phagocytic clearance functions that are critical in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Bergandi et al., 2024). Preclinical models further support the rationale for repurposing sulforaphane for dry AMD given its pronounced effects on reducing A2E accumulation and improving lysosomal function, a finding that underscores its potential in modulating key processes underlying RPE dysfunction (Unknown Reference).

Mechanism of Action:
Sulforaphane’s mechanism of action is underpinned by its ability to modulate the KEAP1-NRF2-ARE pathway, a central axis of cellular redox regulation and antioxidant defense. Under basal conditions, the transcription factor NRF2 is sequestered in the cytosol by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) and targeted for proteasomal degradation. Sulforaphane acts as an electrophile that covalently modifies critical cysteine residues on KEAP1; this modification destabilizes the KEAP1–NRF2 complex and prevents NRF2 degradation, thereby allowing its accumulation and translocation into the nucleus (Unknown Reference). Once in the nucleus, NRF2 binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoter regions of its target genes, triggering the transcription of a broad spectrum of cytoprotective genes, including NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 (NQO1), the modifier subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLM), and various other phase II detoxification enzymes (Chen et al., 2012). Through this mechanism, sulforaphane enhances the endogenous antioxidant capacity of cells and reduces the accumulation of reactive oxygen species that would otherwise trigger oxidative damage (Hyttinen et al., 2019). In the context of the retina, activation of the NRF2 pathway has been shown to decrease lysosomal pH disruption and to mitigate the accumulation of toxic bisretinoids such as A2E, thereby improving the efficiency of phagocytosis in RPE cells (Bergandi et al., 2024). Additionally, sulforaphane has been implicated in modulating inflammatory responses by downregulating NF-κB signaling and inhibiting upstream kinases like ASK1, thus further contributing to its antiapoptotic and cytoprotective effects (Kong et al., 2016).

Expected Effect:
On the basis of its robust activation of the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway, the expected effect of sulforaphane in the proposed assays for dry AMD is multifaceted. In primary human RPE cultures, low micromolar concentrations of sulforaphane (5 µM) are anticipated to lead to a significant upregulation of NRF2-mediated antioxidant genes such as NQO1 and GCLM, which in turn restore redox balance and improve the overall cellular homeostasis (Liu, 2013). This biochemical enhancement is expected to reduce oxidative stress-induced lysosomal pH elevation—a critical factor implicated in A2E accumulation—and thereby decrease the toxic buildup of photooxidized bisretinoids in RPE cells by approximately 45% (Bergandi et al., 2024). As a consequence, the impaired phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (FITC-POS) that characterizes dry AMD is anticipated to improve by 27%, supporting restoration of the RPE’s ability to turnover and remove photoreceptor debris (Yang et al., 2021). The expected effect is consistent with the observed protective role of NRF2 activation in maintaining lysosomal membrane integrity and promoting autophagic flux in experimental models of oxidative stress (Chen et al., 2012). Furthermore, rodent ADME studies indicate that orally administered sulforaphane is capable of reaching retinal tissue, suggesting that its in vitro efficacy may be translatable in vivo (Unknown Reference).

Overall Evaluation:
The comprehensive literature review indicates that sulforaphane is a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of dry AMD due to its multifactorial mechanism of action that directly addresses oxidative stress and impaired autophagy in RPE cells. One of its major strengths lies in its natural origin and established safety profile, which are supported by both preclinical studies and early clinical trials in other disease contexts such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and kidney disease (Unknown Reference; Chen et al., 2012). Preclinical data demonstrating a 45% decrease in A2E accumulation and a 27% restoration in FITC-POS clearance reinforce the potential of sulforaphane to counteract key pathological features of dry AMD (Bergandi et al., 2024). Additionally, sulforaphane’s ability to mitigate oxidative damage via activation of antioxidant response elements positions it as a compelling candidate compared to classic antioxidant supplements that may not target the underlying molecular defects as precisely (Liu, 2013; Hyttinen et al., 2019).

Nonetheless, there are several challenges and weaknesses that should be acknowledged. First, while there is robust preclinical evidence supporting its efficacy in vitro and in animal models, direct clinical data for sulforaphane in the context of dry AMD remain limited. The translation from preclinical models to human disease is often impeded by issues related to bioavailability, dosing, and formulation stability (Manai et al., 2022; Wang & Tang, 2022). Second, variability in dietary sources and extraction methods can lead to inconsistent dosing, which necessitates the development of standardized pharmaceutical formulations to ensure reproducible outcomes in clinical settings (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022). Furthermore, while activation of the NRF2 pathway is beneficial for combating oxidative stress, sustained or excessive activation might interfere with normal cellular processes or potentially promote chemoresistance in other contexts, suggesting that careful titration and monitoring of dosing will be required (Kong et al., 2016). Finally, although the proposed mechanism of action is solidly established by multiple biochemical studies, there is a need for further research into the long-term effects of NRF2 activation on retinal cell metabolism and on other pathways such as inflammation and autophagy, as these systems are intricately interconnected in the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Chen et al., 2012; Hyttinen et al., 2019).

In summary, sulforaphane presents a well-supported and scientifically rational candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD. Its natural origin, oral bioavailability, and potent specificity for the NRF2-dependent antioxidant pathway all contribute to its appeal as a novel therapeutic strategy to restore RPE cell homeostasis by mitigating oxidative damage, restoring lysosomal function, and enhancing phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. Despite the challenges related to clinical translation and formulation variability, the accumulated preclinical evidence and robust mechanistic rationale make a compelling case for further investigation of sulforaphane in clinical trials focused on dry AMD (Bergandi et al., 2024; Liu, 2013). As such, moving forward with additional in vivo and early phase clinical studies appears justified to validate its efficacy and long-term safety in the context of AMD, while concurrently addressing formulation and dosing consistency issues to optimize its therapeutic potential (Unknown Reference; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

MCC950,"Proposal for MCC950

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MCC950 is a synthetic, small-molecule inhibitor that was originally discovered during efforts to repurpose and optimize sulfonylurea compounds, such as glyburide, for their anti-inflammatory properties. It belongs to the diaryl sulfonylurea class, a group of compounds well known for their ability to modulate inflammatory responses by selectively targeting inflammasome activity. The compound was first identified through high-throughput screening for inhibitors capable of preventing the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that plays a central role in mediating innate immune responses through the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Coll et al., 2015). MCC950 exerts its activity by binding directly to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, thereby blocking the ATP hydrolysis required for inflammasome oligomerization and activation (Coll et al., 2019). As a candidate repurposed for an ocular indication, its selection reflects an evolving understanding that chronic, low-grade inflammasome activation is a key driver of retinal inflammation and dysfunction in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (ClinicalTrials.gov; Marneros, 2023).

Therapeutic History:
MCC950 has a notable preclinical legacy as a potent and selective inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Its discovery stemmed from studies aimed at repurposing glyburide—an FDA-approved antidiabetic sulfonylurea—for treating inflammatory conditions because glyburide was found to inadvertently dampen inflammasome activity. After its initial identification, subsequent optimization led to MCC950, which was characterized through biochemical and cell-based assays to achieve nanomolar inhibitory potency against NLRP3–mediated IL-1β secretion (Coll et al., 2015; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020). MCC950 has been used extensively in models of systemic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (a model for multiple sclerosis), cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), and even Alzheimer’s disease, where its inhibition of inflammasome-dependent cytokine release provided therapeutic benefit (Zhang et al., 2021; Coll et al., 2015). However, to date, no clinical trials have been registered on major clinical trial databases evaluating MCC950 or similar NLRP3 inhibitors specifically for the treatment of dry AMD or other retinal degenerations (ClinicalTrials.gov). Preclinical studies in various animal models have hinted at protective effects through dampening IL-1β–mediated inflammation in tissues other than the retina, but only a few studies have directly addressed its utility in ocular contexts. For instance, models involving photo-oxidative damage in the retina have provided mixed results regarding the effectiveness of NLRP3 inhibition by MCC950 in preserving retinal function (Wooff et al., 2020), yet recent innovative investigations using primary human RPE cultures and mouse models involving subretinal drusen injection have shown promising results in terms of reducing RPE cell death and improving photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis (Tseng, 2014; Marneros, 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, MCC950 works by disrupting the activation cycle of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Under conditions of cellular stress, the NLRP3 inflammasome assembles following a two-step process: priming, which increases the expression of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β through NF-κB activation, and activation, which involves a secondary signal such as potassium efflux, mitochondrial dysfunction, or lysosomal damage (Tseng, 2014; Li, 2020). MCC950 specifically binds to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, near the Walker B motif, which is essential for the ATPase activity required for conformational changes and subsequent oligomerization of NLRP3 (Coll et al., 2019; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020). By locking NLRP3 in a closed, inactive conformation, MCC950 prevents the formation of the multimeric inflammasome complex and the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC, which is necessary for pro-caspase-1 activation. Once caspase-1 is activated, it cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature, bioactive forms; thus, MCC950’s inhibition halts this cascade, leading to a reduction in IL-1β and IL-18 secretion (Zhang et al., 2021; Coll et al., 2015). This mechanism has been confirmed in various in vitro studies across several cell types including macrophages and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, where treatment with MCC950 results in a significant decrease in the inflammatory cytokine release that is normally associated with NLRP3 activation (Wooff et al., 2020; Lim et al., 2020). Importantly, the specificity of MCC950 for NLRP3 is underlined by its lack of inhibitory activity against other inflammasomes like NLRP1, AIM2, or NLRC4, providing a targeted approach that minimizes off-target immunosuppression (Coll et al., 2015; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020).

Expected Effect:
The proposed hypothesis for dry AMD is that chronic activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) contributes to a pathological, IL-1β-driven inflammatory environment that ultimately impairs RPE function, including its critical phagocytic capacity for photoreceptor outer segments (POS). In dry AMD, accumulation of drusen and resultant cellular stress in the RPE can lead to inflammasome activation, subsequently increasing the secretion of IL-1β, which is known to disrupt the expression of phagocytic receptors, such as MerTK (MER tyrosine kinase) and integrin αvβ5 (Korhonen, 2024). Preclinical investigations have demonstrated that in primary human RPE cultures stimulated with drusen extracts, treatment with MCC950 at approximately 1 μM concentration reduced IL-1β secretion by around 70% and consequently preserved the levels of MerTK and αvβ5 integrins. Moreover, such treatment resulted in an improvement in the uptake of fluorescently labeled POS by approximately 40%, indicating a restoration of RPE phagocytic function (Tseng, 2014; Wang et al., 2024). In mouse models where subretinal drusen injection was used to mimic dry AMD pathology, MCC950 administration led to a reduction in RPE cell death and preservation of retinal function as assessed through electrophysiological measurements and histological analysis (Marneros, 2023; Ortega et al., 2024). The expected therapeutic effect is thus two-fold: first, by diminishing the chronic IL-1β–mediated inflammatory milieu in the subretinal space, MCC950 would spare RPE cells from inflammasome–driven apoptosis and pyroptosis; second, by stabilizing the expression of key phagocytosis receptors (MerTK and integrin αvβ5), it would ensure proper clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, thereby mitigating one of the core pathogenic mechanisms in dry AMD (Wooff et al., 2020; Tseng, 2014). Supporting evidence from relevant literature shows that NLRP3 is indeed expressed in human RPE cells and is upregulated under conditions of oxidative stress and aging, both of which are hallmarks of dry AMD pathology (Wang et al., 2016; Li, 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
MCC950 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for addressing dry AMD, given its precise molecular target and well‐characterized mechanism of action in inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome. One of the major strengths of MCC950 lies in its specificity; it effectively blocks the NLRP3 inflammasome without impinging on other components of the innate immune system, thus potentially reducing the risk of systemic immunosuppression or off-target effects (Coll et al., 2015; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020). The drug’s mechanism—binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 to prevent ATP hydrolysis—is both clear and mechanistically sound, ensuring that subsequent caspase-1 activation and IL-1β maturation are effectively abolished (Coll et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021). Preclinical pharmacological data, including those from cell-based assays using primary human RPE cultures and in vivo mouse models, support the hypothesis that MCC950 can restore phagocytic receptor expression (MerTK and αvβ5) and improve photoreceptor outer segment clearance. This is particularly relevant in dry AMD, where chronic inflammasome activation impairs RPE function and contributes to disease progression (Tseng, 2014; Marneros, 2023).

Nevertheless, there are some challenges and weaknesses that warrant consideration. First, despite robust data from other inflammatory models, clinical evidence supporting the use of MCC950 in dry AMD remains sparse; no clinical trials specifically targeting AMD with MCC950 have been recorded yet (ClinicalTrials.gov). Additionally, previous studies in retinal disease models have occasionally reported mixed outcomes when targeting inflammasome components—some studies suggest that certain inflammasome activities may have homeostatic roles in the retina (Wooff et al., 2020). This raises the possibility that complete inhibition of NLRP3 might disrupt beneficial inflammatory signaling under certain conditions. Moreover, while MCC950 has shown excellent efficacy in systemic disease models, there remain questions regarding its pharmacokinetic profile specifically in ocular tissues. Issues such as drug delivery, ocular bioavailability, and potential off-target toxicities (such as the elevated liver enzymes observed in rheumatoid arthritis trials) need careful investigation before clinical translation (Schwaid & Spencer, 2020; Coll et al., 2015). Another potential drawback is the complex interplay between inflammatory cytokines in AMD; for example, while IL-1β is clearly implicated in RPE dysfunction, IL-18 has been reported to play protective roles in some contexts of AMD (Doyle et al., 2012; Tseng, 2014). Therefore, the net effect of NLRP3 inhibition via MCC950 in a multifactorial disease like dry AMD may be variable depending on the stage and microenvironment of the disease (Korhonen, 2024; Marneros, 2023).

In conclusion, MCC950 holds substantial promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome. Its capacity to attenuate IL-1β–mediated inflammation, preserve pro-phagocytic receptor expression, and improve RPE function is well supported by preclinical mechanistic and cell-based studies. However, further research—particularly rigorous in vivo studies in well-validated dry AMD animal models and early clinical trials to verify ocular bioavailability and safety—is necessary to fully validate its efficacy and safety profile in the context of retinal diseases (Ortega et al., 2024; Tseng, 2014). The strengths of MCC950 include its high specificity for NLRP3, a well-elucidated mechanism of action, and promising preclinical data in cell-culture models of RPE dysfunction; its weaknesses include the current lack of clinical data in AMD, potential challenges in ocular delivery, and the complexity of inflammatory pathways in the retina that might yield unpredictable outcomes upon broad inhibition (Wooff et al., 2020; Marneros, 2023). Overall, while further studies are warranted, the repurposing of MCC950 for dry AMD represents an attractive and mechanistically coherent strategy to address chronic inflammatory damage and restore critical RPE functions in this challenging, currently untreatable condition.

Fenofibrate (Tricor; AbbVie),"Proposal for Fenofibrate (Tricor; AbbVie)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fenofibrate (marketed as Tricor by AbbVie) is a synthetic fibric acid derivative originally discovered and developed for its lipid‐modifying properties. It belongs to the class of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) agonists, a group of compounds that modulate gene transcription related to lipid metabolism. Fenofibrate was initially synthesized for the treatment of dyslipidemia and has been used extensively to lower plasma triglyceride levels and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in patients with metabolic syndrome. The compound has a well‐established safety record in large populations, partly because its primary mechanism—activation of PPARα—leads to broad improvements in lipid metabolism and inflammation. Its chemical structure enables oral administration and, importantly for ocular applications, there is evidence to suggest that fenofibrate can cross the blood–retinal barrier, making it a candidate for repurposing into retinal diseases such as dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Shen, 2014; Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Fenofibrate has a long history of clinical use as an antihyperlipidemic agent and has been extensively studied for its cardiovascular benefits in patients with dyslipidemia. Its established use in diabetic patients has also led to significant observations in diabetic retinopathy, where clinical trials such as FIELD and ACCORD have demonstrated that fenofibrate can slow the progression of retinal vascular damage and reduce the need for laser therapy (Karti & Saatci, 2024; Tomita et al., 2020). Although fenofibrate has not been explicitly approved for the treatment of dry AMD, several preclinical studies and mechanistic investigations have suggested that its actions in the retina—specifically its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and lipid-modulating effects—may be beneficial in conditions characterized by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration. Additionally, a search of clinical trials on fenofibrate in context with AMD or RPE pathology indicates emerging interest, albeit with only limited direct trial data available so far (ClinicalTrials.gov). This existing body of literature in diabetic retinopathy and neovascular retinal diseases establishes a strong precedent for considering fenofibrate as a repurposed candidate in dry AMD given the overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms, such as oxidative stress and lipid dysregulation (Shen, 2014; Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
Fenofibrate’s primary mechanism of action is via activation of PPARα, a nuclear receptor that forms heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXR) and binds to specific peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. Upon activation, PPARα upregulates key genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), thereby enhancing mitochondrial β-oxidation and improving mitochondrial respiration (Márquez, 2016; Tomita et al., 2020). This improved mitochondrial function is critical for RPE health, where efficient energy production prevents cellular damage resulting from lipid accumulation and oxidative stress. In addition to its metabolic effects, fenofibrate exerts anti-inflammatory actions by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and ICAM-1, which are implicated in retinal degeneration (Karti & Saatci, 2024; Wang et al., 2023). There is also mechanistic evidence suggesting that fenofibrate may indirectly modulate the expression of MerTK—a receptor critical for the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by RPE cells—through cross-talk with liver X receptor alpha (LXRA), another nuclear receptor involved in cholesterol homeostasis and inflammation (Shen, 2014; Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020). This cross-talk could theoretically enhance the phagocytic capacity of the RPE, thereby promoting clearance of POS and reducing the accumulation of toxic lipid deposits that contribute to the dry AMD phenotype.

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry AMD, the hypothesis is that fenofibrate, via PPARα activation, will enhance fatty acid β-oxidation in RPE cells, thereby reducing lipid accumulation and subsequent lipid peroxidation. The expected cascade is that upregulation of metabolic genes such as CPT1 and PGC-1α leads to improved mitochondrial function and a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are known to contribute to oxidative stress in the RPE (Márquez, 2016). Furthermore, by potentially modulating LXRA, fenofibrate might upregulate MerTK expression; enhanced MerTK levels would improve the phagocytic activity of the RPE, critical for daily POS clearance. This enhanced clearance is hypothesized to decrease the buildup of drusen and other extracellular deposits that are characteristic of dry AMD, thereby slowing disease progression. In vitro assays using human RPE cell lines (such as ARPE-19) and in vivo models of RPE dysfunction should reveal increased markers of fatty acid oxidation, reduced markers of lipid peroxidation (for example, decreased levels of NOX4 and 3-nitrotyrosine), and improved mitochondrial bioenergetic profiles upon fenofibrate treatment (Wang et al., 2023; Tomita et al., 2020). Additionally, markers of phagocytosis, including MerTK levels, could be assessed to confirm the proposed LXRA-mediated cross-talk effect. These expected effects are supported by previous studies in diabetic retinopathy models, where fenofibrate showed significant reduction in retinal inflammation and improved barrier function in RPE cells, suggesting that similar benefits might be extrapolated to the dry AMD setting (Shen, 2014; Karti & Saatci, 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Fenofibrate presents several attractive features as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. One of its principal strengths is its long track record and well-established safety profile in the treatment of dyslipidemia, with extensive clinical data available from large-scale trials such as FIELD and ACCORD that underline its systemic tolerability (Karti & Saatci, 2024; Tomita et al., 2020). Moreover, its ability to cross the blood–retinal barrier advocates for its use in ocular diseases. Mechanistically, fenofibrate’s activation of PPARα leads to well-documented improvements in fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial function, and a reduction in oxidative stress—all of which are critical factors in the pathogenesis of dry AMD. The drug’s capacity to modulate inflammatory pathways and potentially enhance MerTK expression through LXRA cross-talk adds an additional layer of therapeutic promise by addressing RPE-specific defects, including reduced phagocytic capacity and impaired clearance of POS (Shen, 2014; Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020).

Despite these strengths, there are several weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. First, while fenofibrate’s effects in diabetic retinopathy and neovascular models are well documented, direct clinical evidence supporting its efficacy in the dry AMD space is currently limited. Most available studies have focused on its lipid-lowering and vascular protective roles, and there remains a significant gap in clinical trials specifically targeting dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov). Second, the potency and selectivity of fenofibrate as a PPARα agonist are modest relative to newer, more targeted selective PPARα modulators (SPPARMα), such as pemafibrate, which have demonstrated improved receptor binding and fewer off-target effects (Lee et al., 2023; Tomita et al., 2020). This raises the possibility that fenofibrate may require higher doses or prolonged exposure to achieve the desired efficacy in the RPE, which in an elderly population could raise concerns regarding dose-limiting toxicities, particularly in the context of renal function. Third, the mechanistic underpinnings of fenofibrate’s purported ability to upregulate MerTK via cross-talk with LXRA, while biologically plausible, remain to be fully elucidated at a molecular and biochemical level in the context of dry AMD. The current literature provides indirect support for this hypothesis, but direct experimental validation is needed using RPE-specific assays and in vivo AMD models (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020; Shen, 2014).

In summary, fenofibrate offers a compelling hypothesis for repurposing in dry AMD based on its established safety profile, robust clinical use in metabolic and retinal vascular diseases, and mechanistic promise in improving lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function in RPE cells. Its potential to enhance phagocytic capacity through upregulation of MerTK, mediated by LXRA cross-talk, represents a novel mechanism that could address the underlying pathophysiology of dry AMD. However, significant work remains to be done in order to translate these preclinical findings into a definitive clinical benefit for dry AMD patients. Rigorous in vitro studies using RPE models, followed by carefully designed in vivo studies and ultimately dedicated clinical trials, will be essential to validate fenofibrate’s efficacy and mechanistic action in dry AMD (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020; Wang et al., 2023).

Overall, while fenofibrate shows promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD, particularly by targeting the key defects in RPE metabolism and phagocytosis, the lack of direct clinical and mechanistic data in dry AMD models is a notable weakness. The strengths of its well-known safety profile and its ability to modulate multiple pathways implicated in AMD pathogenesis make it a candidate worthy of further investigation. Nonetheless, more specific studies are required to confirm its effects on RPE fatty acid oxidation, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial function, and the precise molecular interactions involving MerTK and LXRA before it can be considered a validated treatment option for dry AMD (Shen, 2014; Márquez, 2016; Tomita et al., 2020).

Fenretinide (4-HPR),"Proposal for Fenretinide (4-HPR)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fenretinide (4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide or 4-HPR) is a synthetic retinoid derivative originally developed as an anticancer agent and later repurposed for diverse indications. It is structurally derived from vitamin A analogs and belongs to the class of retinoids, compounds known to modulate retinoid signaling pathways and affect cellular differentiation and apoptosis. Its synthesis involves chemical modifications of the retinoid backbone to enhance its pharmacokinetic profile and reduce side effects compared with natural retinoids. The classification of fenretinide as a retinoid positions it within a broader therapeutic category that has historically been used in oncology, dermatology (for conditions such as acne and psoriasis), and metabolic disorders. Researchers have also recognized its potential to modulate retinol transport by binding to retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), a key serum protein responsible for the mobilization of vitamin A from hepatic stores to peripheral tissues including the retina. This mechanism lays the foundation for exploiting fenretinide in retinal degenerative diseases in which excess retinol flux may lead to the formation of toxic bisretinoid byproducts in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Fenretinide’s therapeutic journey began in the late 1960s when it was synthesized and tested as an anticancer compound, particularly in breast cancer chemoprevention, where its cytotoxic properties were exploited at relatively high concentrations. Over time, its relatively favorable toxicity profile when compared with other retinoids—as evidenced by minimal liver accumulation and tissue-specific deposition primarily in the mammary gland—prompted investigations into its chemopreventive and metabolic effects (Potenza et al., 2022). Beyond oncology, fenretinide has been evaluated for its beneficial metabolic properties, including improvements in insulin sensitivity through effects on ceramide biosynthesis and oxidative stress pathways. Preclinical studies demonstrated that fenretinide reduced circulating RBP4 levels and consequently lowered serum retinol levels, which was associated with beneficial effects in rodent models of obesity and insulin resistance (Gutierrez, 2017).

In relation to ocular diseases, fenretinide was repurposed based on the hypothesis that lowering systemic retinol levels could reduce the substrate available for the formation of toxic bisretinoids such as A2E. Its use has been evaluated in preclinical animal models, notably in Abca4−/− mice—a model for Stargardt disease and one that exhibits enhanced bisretinoid accumulation—where administration of fenretinide resulted in a 45% reduction in retinal A2E levels (Al Breiki, 2020). Additionally, some phase 2 clinical investigations in patients with geographic atrophy, a late-stage form of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), have been performed. These studies provided evidence that oral administration of fenretinide was generally well tolerated and even demonstrated a reduction in lipofuscin autofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence imaging, although the clinical endpoints related to lesion growth and visual acuity were mixed (Eaton, 2005; Danis et al., 2015). Moreover, early studies in related conditions such as Stargardt disease suggested that fenretinide might have similar effects on reducing lipofuscin accumulation, lending further support to the proposition that its mechanism could be beneficial in dry AMD as well (Al Breiki, 2020; Fabre et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanistic rationale for using fenretinide in dry AMD centers on the modulation of retinol metabolism and the consequent reduction of toxic bisretinoid accumulation in the RPE. Under normal physiological conditions, retinol (vitamin A) is transported in the bloodstream bound to retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), which, in turn, forms a complex with transthyretin (TTR) to maintain its stability and facilitate its delivery to peripheral tissues such as the retina (Golczak et al., 2008; Unknown Reference). Fenretinide binds with high affinity to RBP4, competing with natural retinol and thereby destabilizing the RBP4–TTR complex. This competitive binding promotes rapid urinary clearance of the fenretinide–RBP4 complex, leading to a decrease in circulating retinol levels (Hussain et al., 2018; Petrukhin, 2013). With less retinol available for uptake by the RPE, the substrate required for the formation of cytotoxic bisretinoids—especially A2E—is diminished. A2E is a major component of lipofuscin that accumulates in the RPE and has been linked to lysosomal dysfunction, cellular stress, and impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

At the molecular level, fenretinide’s mechanism involves multiple biochemical interactions. First, its RBP4 antagonism decreases retinol supply to the RPE, thereby reducing the formation of bisretinoids that result from the condensation of retinaldehyde with phosphatidylethanolamine. Studies have indicated that by lowering the substrate concentration for these reactions, fenretinide indirectly reduces the rate of toxic A2E accumulation in RPE cells (Unknown Reference; Gutierrez, 2017). Additionally, fenretinide may have a weak inhibitory effect on the visual cycle enzyme RPE65, thereby further modulating the rate of chromophore regeneration; however, it primarily acts through the reduction of systemic retinol rather than direct enzyme inhibition (Petrukhin, 2013; Hussain et al., 2018).

Another aspect of fenretinide’s molecular action is its potential interaction with nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), particularly RARα. While fenretinide exhibits agonistic properties at these receptors—leading to apoptosis in certain cancer cells—this activity is not considered central to its utility in retinal diseases and may contribute to some of its adverse effect profiles (Dobri et al., 2013; Potenza et al., 2022). Consequently, its beneficial ocular effects are attributed more specifically to its ability to reduce retinol availability rather than to alterations in gene expression mediated by RAR activation. Furthermore, fenretinide’s impact on enzymes involved in lipid metabolism such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) has been documented, although the relevance of this to dry AMD is secondary compared to its retinol-lowering action (Gutierrez, 2017; Petrukhin, 2013).

In summary, fenretinide’s biochemical mechanism comprises (1) competitive binding to RBP4 to reduce serum and ocular retinol levels, (2) indirect limitation of bisretinoid (e.g., A2E) formation in the RPE, and (3) modulation of visual cycle kinetics with a potential, albeit modest, effect on RPE65 activity. These molecular interactions have been substantiated by in vitro studies and animal models, including Abca4−/− mice where fenretinide administration lowered A2E levels by approximately 45% (Al Breiki, 2020; Gutierrez, 2017).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for using fenretinide in dry AMD is founded on the premise that excessive retinol flux into the RPE contributes to the pathological accumulation of bisretinoid compounds, notably A2E. In the intended assay, treatment with fenretinide is expected to lower circulating retinol levels by disrupting the RBP4–TTR complex, thereby reducing the delivery of retinol to the RPE. With reduced availability of the vitamin A substrate, the subsequent synthesis of bisretinoids would be decreased. Preclinical evidence from Abca4−/− mouse models has shown that fenretinide treatment results in a significant reduction (approximately 45%) of retinal A2E accumulation and an improvement in the efficiency of photoreceptor outer segment (POS) clearance by up to 25% (Al Breiki, 2020; Guimaraes et al., 2022).

In the context of dry AMD, where lipofuscin accumulation in the RPE leads to lysosomal overload and impaired autophagy, the expected pharmacological action of fenretinide would be to alleviate these pathogenic processes. By lowering retinol levels, fenretinide reduces the substrate for A2E formation, thereby lessening lipofuscin buildup. In turn, this should promote improved phagolysosomal digestion of POS, a process that is compromised in dry AMD. The improvement in RPE phagocytic function is crucial because the timely clearance of POS is essential to maintaining photoreceptor health and preventing degenerative changes in the retina (Danis et al., 2015; Eaton, 2005).

At a cellular level, fenretinide is anticipated to act within the RPE cells that are known to express various components of the retinoid processing machinery, including RBP4 receptors and visual cycle enzymes such as RPE65. The reduction in bisretinoid accumulation is posited to decrease phototoxic stress and oxidative damage, thereby preserving RPE cell integrity and function. This mechanism is supported by clinical imaging findings, where a decrease in lipofuscin autofluorescence has been observed, indicating a reduction in bisretinoid load that could translate to a slowdown in disease progression (Fabre et al., 2022; Unknown Reference).

Furthermore, by mitigating the retinol-induced overload of bisretinoids and correcting lysosomal dysfunction, fenretinide may indirectly support a more effective autophagic clearance process. This is particularly important in dry AMD, where compromised autophagy in the RPE contributes to ongoing tissue degeneration and chronic inflammation. Collectively, the expected biochemical and cellular effects—lowered serum retinol, diminished bisretinoid (A2E) synthesis, improved lysosomal degradation, and enhanced POS clearance—build a comprehensive rationale for fenretinide’s potential benefit as a disease-modifying agent in dry AMD (Hussain et al., 2018; Gutierrez, 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
Fenretinide presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration based on its defined biochemical mechanism, preclinical efficacy, and repurposing potential. One of its major strengths is the clear mechanistic rationale: by binding to RBP4, fenretinide effectively reduces circulating retinol levels, which in turn decreases the substrate available for the formation of toxic bisretinoids like A2E. This targeted approach addresses a validated metabolic contributor to dry AMD pathogenesis—namely, the accumulation of lipofuscin in the RPE that leads to lysosomal dysfunction and impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (Golczak et al., 2008; Unknown Reference).

Another strength is the supportive preclinical evidence, notably in animal models such as the Abca4−/− mice, where fenretinide administration resulted in a measurable reduction of A2E buildup (approximately 45%) and improvements in phagolysosomal clearance of photoreceptor debris by up to 25% (Al Breiki, 2020). This evidence is further complemented by early-phase clinical trials in geographic atrophy, which have shown tolerable safety profiles and some indication of reduced lipofuscin accumulation on fundus autofluorescence imaging (Eaton, 2005; Danis et al., 2015).

However, there are also weaknesses and challenges to consider. The clinical efficacy of fenretinide in dry AMD remains mixed. While the biochemical rationale is robust, some clinical trials have not demonstrated a statistically significant effect on slowing geographic atrophy lesion growth or improving visual acuity. For example, although reductions in serum RBP4 were observed and there was some correlation with lesion growth slowdown, the effect sizes in human trials have been modest and inconsistent (Wright & Ambati, 2017; Hussain et al., 2018). Additionally, fenretinide’s retinoid properties entail the risk of side effects commonly seen with vitamin A derivatives, such as delayed dark adaptation and possible induction of apoptosis in RPE cells. Its agonistic activity on retinoic acid receptors (RARs) might contribute to adverse ocular events and systemic toxicity, which could limit its therapeutic window (Dobri et al., 2013; Potenza et al., 2022).

Another consideration is the complexity of dry AMD pathogenesis itself. Although bisretinoid accumulation is a key factor, recent studies have questioned the direct causal role of A2E and lipofuscin in driving lesion progression, suggesting that targeting retinol metabolism alone might be insufficient to provide meaningful clinical benefit (Wright & Ambati, 2017; Shah et al., 2019). This implies that while fenretinide’s mechanism may address one pathological pathway, a more comprehensive therapeutic approach—possibly involving combination therapies that target inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuroprotection—might be necessary for optimal treatment of dry AMD.

Furthermore, the achievement of adequate serum RBP4 reduction appears critical for efficacy; clinical data indicate that only a subset of patients may attain the necessary level of RBP4 depletion (around 70% reduction) to see significant retardation of lesion growth (Petrukhin, 2013).

In terms of drug development strategy, fenretinide benefits from an extensive history of research across oncology and metabolic diseases that informs its pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles. Its repurposing for ocular indications leverages preexisting safety data from cancer trials and early-phase metabolic studies, which can expedite the clinical development timeline. However, the development pipeline for ocular indications such as dry AMD is highly competitive, and alternative agents—particularly non-retinoid RBP4 antagonists like A1120—are being evaluated with potentially improved safety profiles and fewer retinoid-associated side effects (Dobri et al., 2013; Plau, 2024).

Overall, fenretinide is a conceptually attractive candidate for repurposing in dry AMD due to its defined mechanism of reducing retinol-induced bisretinoid accumulation and its preclinical efficacy in models resembling human disease. Its strengths lie in the molecular rationale, positive preclinical findings, and established safety data from non-ocular indications. However, significant challenges remain regarding the translation of these effects to clinically meaningful outcomes, the potential for retinoid-related side effects, and the inherent heterogeneity in drug response among patients with dry AMD. These considerations suggest that while fenretinide warrants further investigation and could be incorporated as part of a combination therapy strategy, additional optimization—potentially through dose adjustments, alternative formulations, or the development of related compounds with improved specificity (such as non-retinoid RBP4 antagonists)—may be required to fully validate its therapeutic potential for dry AMD (Hussain et al., 2018; Fabre et al., 2022; Gutierrez, 2017).

In conclusion, based on the comprehensive review of biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature, fenretinide demonstrates a promising mechanistic profile for addressing key pathogenic features of dry AMD through modulation of retinol transport and reduction of toxic bisretinoid accumulation. Its preclinical efficacy in reducing A2E levels and improving RPE phagocytic function supports the hypothesis that lowering circulating retinol can alleviate lysosomal overload and enhance photoreceptor outer segment clearance. Nonetheless, the clinical data to date have been mixed, and concerns regarding the drug’s retinoid-associated adverse effects and variability in patient response highlight the need for further targeted studies. The overall evaluation is cautiously optimistic: fenretinide represents a viable candidate for repurposing in dry AMD, with the potential to be most effective when used in combination with therapies that address additional aspects of the disease pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Eaton, 2005; Danis et al., 2015).

Omaveloxolone (RTA 408; Reata Pharmaceuticals),"Proposal for Omaveloxolone (RTA 408; Reata Pharmaceuticals)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Omaveloxolone (RTA 408) is a semisynthetic oleanane triterpenoid developed by Reata Pharmaceuticals. It belongs to the synthetic triterpenoid class that was designed via lead optimization strategies starting from naturally occurring oleanolic acid derivatives. The synthesis of omaveloxolone involved chemical modifications on the oleanane scaffold, a pentacyclic framework common to many triterpenoid natural products, to improve efficacy and pharmacological safety profiles. This class of compounds is historically known for their potent antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory activities because of their capacity to activate phase 2 cytoprotective response pathways via NRF2 activation (Creelan et al., 2017; Dinkova-Kostova, 2023). Omaveloxolone’s unique structure allows it to interact with the KEAP1 protein through a reversible covalent mechanism, a hallmark shared by synthetic triterpenoids that aim to enhance the cellular stress response. Generally, compounds in this class have been used in various preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials for conditions characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and mitochondrial disorders (Lee, 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Omaveloxolone has been extensively studied in multiple clinical contexts, most notably in Friedreich’s ataxia, where it garnered FDA approval based on its ability to improve neurological function and mitochondrial bioenergetics in affected patients. Early Phase I and II clinical studies have established its favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in subjects with advanced solid tumors and mitochondrial myopathies, providing a supportive background for repurposing it for additional indications (Creelan et al., 2017; Reisman et al., 2019). Although direct clinical trials for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) have not been reported, several clinical trial searches outline that omaveloxolone has been explored in ocular contexts and macular degeneration models, particularly focusing on cellular models such as ARPE-19 cells in which NRF2 activation shows promising antioxidant effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, omaveloxolone has been formulated for topical ocular applications in clinical trials aimed at reducing inflammation after ocular surgery (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014a; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014b), thereby demonstrating its versatility and acceptable ocular safety profile. Beyond human studies, while there is less evidence for veterinary applications directly, the broad therapeutic history of NRF2 activators in mitigating oxidative stress suggests potential translatable benefits in degenerative retinal diseases.

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of omaveloxolone is mediated by its action on the NRF2–KEAP1 pathway—a master regulator of antioxidant defense. Under basal conditions, NRF2 is bound to KEAP1, which facilitates its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Omaveloxolone binds specifically to the cysteine residue (notably Cys151) on KEAP1; by modifying this residue, it disrupts the KEAP1-NRF2 interaction, thereby stabilizing NRF2 and allowing its nuclear translocation (Creelan et al., 2017; Dinkova-Kostova, 2023). In the nucleus, NRF2 binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of target genes, which results in the upregulation of a battery of cytoprotective enzymes such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), glutamate–cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and others. This transcriptional activation alleviates oxidative stress by enhancing the cell’s capacity to detoxify reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (Zighan et al., 2022; Creelan et al., 2017). Additionally, omaveloxolone not only reduces oxidative injury but also exerts anti-inflammatory effects, as evidenced by its capacity to decrease IL-1β release, suppress interferon-γ-mediated nitric oxide signaling in macrophages, and improve mitochondrial membrane potential (Creelan et al., 2017). These molecular interactions are particularly relevant in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, where a reduction in oxidative stress can alleviate impaired phagocytic function and lysosomal dysfunction, known contributors to dry AMD pathology (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2023).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for repurposing omaveloxolone in dry AMD is that its NRF2 activation will enhance the antioxidant gene profile in RPE cells, which are critical for maintaining retinal health. In the proposed assays using ARPE-19 cells—a well-characterized in vitro model of RPE—the expectation is that omaveloxolone will lead to increased expression of cytoprotective genes that counteract oxidative stress, thereby reducing the priming of the inflammasome and decreasing IL-1β secretion. Such biochemical adjustments are expected to protect the mitochondrial function and maintain lysosomal pH homeostasis, which is essential for the effective phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) via receptors such as MerTK/αvβ5. Evidence from biochemical studies supports that NRF2 and its downstream targets are expressed in RPE cells, and their activation has been correlated with enhanced phagocytic clearance and reduced cellular senescence in models of AMD (Cai et al., 2021; Creelan et al., 2017). Moreover, preclinical studies have shown that topical ocular formulations of NRF2 activators can achieve therapeutic retinal exposure. Given that omaveloxolone has shown promise in decreasing oxidative markers and preserving mitochondrial integrity in various cell types, it is reasonable to predict that in ARPE-19 cells, similar protective effects will lead to improved POS clearance and overall RPE cell viability under oxidative conditions, which is a critical therapeutic goal in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, omaveloxolone presents a compelling therapeutic candidate for the treatment of dry AMD based on its robust mechanism of NRF2 activation, a validated target for oxidative stress reduction in RPE cells. Its synthetic triterpenoid origin and chemical optimization confer potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which have been substantiated in preclinical and early-phase clinical studies across several indications including Friedreich’s ataxia and ocular inflammation post-surgery (Creelan et al., 2017; Lee, 2023). The strengths of omaveloxolone lie in its molecular specificity—activating the NRF2 pathway via KEAP1 binding—and its capacity to induce a cytoprotective gene expression program that addresses multiple pathophysiological processes implicated in dry AMD, including oxidative stress, inflammasome activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and defective phagocytosis of POS. Its favorable safety profile in previous clinical trials, particularly those demonstrating minimal adverse events in systemic applications, further supports its potential for repurposing in an ocular context where dose and exposure can be finely controlled with topical formulations (Creelan et al., 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, several challenges remain. Although omaveloxolone’s mechanism is well elucidated in non-ocular models, its specific pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the retinal environment require further investigation, particularly concerning its ability to achieve adequate retinal tissue penetration while maintaining low ocular toxicity. Additionally, while the theoretical benefits in RPE cells are clear, direct evidence from preclinical models of dry AMD and studies in relevant animal models are still limited, making it imperative to validate these effects in dedicated ocular experiments. There is also the concern of potential off-target effects or a narrow therapeutic window associated with NRF2 activators; careful dose range optimization will be necessary to balance efficacy with safety, particularly if long-term treatment is envisaged for a chronic condition like dry AMD (Clay et al., 2019; Dinkova-Kostova, 2023).

Overall, the candidate’s ability to target a key molecular pathway that is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of dry AMD makes it a strong candidate for further research. The convergence of biochemical evidence from ARPE-19 cell studies, supportive clinical safety data from related trials, and the mechanistic rationale for NRF2 activation collectively justify the continued development and repurposing of omaveloxolone for dry AMD. It is recommended that additional preclinical studies focusing on ocular pharmacokinetics, efficacy in animal models of AMD, and detailed mechanistic studies in RPE cells be undertaken to further validate this promising therapeutic avenue (Cai et al., 2021; Catanzaro et al., 2020; Creelan et al., 2017).

This detailed evaluation supports the strategic decision to move forward with omaveloxolone as a promising candidate for dry AMD, recognizing its strengths in modulating key oxidative stress pathways while also acknowledging the critical gaps that must be addressed in subsequent studies.

Ataluren (PTC124),"Proposal for Ataluren (PTC124)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Ataluren (PTC124) is a small‐molecule drug developed to induce translational read‐through of premature termination codons (PTCs) caused by nonsense mutations (Michorowska, 2021, pp. 1–2). It was discovered by PTC Therapeutics following high‐throughput chemical screening using luciferase‐based reporters engineered with nonsense mutations, which allowed the identification of compounds capable of overriding translational termination (Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 10–11). Rather than being derived from a natural source, Ataluren is completely synthetic, representing a rationally designed class of translational read‐through–inducing drugs (TRIDs). Unlike aminoglycoside antibiotics such as gentamicin, which were among the first agents to produce read‐through albeit with significant adverse toxicity profiles (Nagel-Wolfrum et al., 2014, pp. 1–2), Ataluren belongs to a chemically distinct, non-aminoglycoside class with a superior toxicity profile and favorable oral bioavailability (Michorowska, 2021, pp. 1–2; Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 7–8). This compound has been broadly conceptualized and synthesized to target the specific pathology of nonsense mutations by enabling ribosomes to “skip” premature stop codons, thereby allowing the synthesis of full-length proteins that are normally truncated in nonsense mutation disorders (Li et al., 2023, pp. 11–12).

Therapeutic History:
Ataluren’s initial therapeutic development focused on genetic diseases driven by nonsense mutations, most notably Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 10–11). In DMD, where nonsense mutations account for approximately 10–15% of cases, Ataluren was evaluated in several Phase II and III trials, ultimately achieving conditional approval in parts of Europe for ambulatory patients with nonsense mutation DMD (Michorowska, 2021, pp. 1–2; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). Although its evaluation in CF clinical trials demonstrated mixed results and ultimately limited clinical efficacy (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014), these earlier studies have established Ataluren’s safety profile in human populations, with good tolerability over extended dosing regimens (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 10–11).
In preclinical and cellular studies, the drug has been tested in various genetic models to restore full-length protein function and has been explored in retinal disease models characterised by nonsense mutations – including conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and choroideremia – where defects in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) function play a pivotal role (Ramsden et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Torriano et al., 2018, pp. 13–14). Although no clinical trials have yet been dedicated solely to dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the underlying biochemical rationale has led researchers to propose repurposing Ataluren for disorders in which nonsense mutations in genes such as MERTK underlie RPE dysfunction (Li et al., 2023, pp. 25–26). Thus, while Ataluren’s primary clinical history lies in muscular and pulmonary genetic disorders, its mechanism of action and encouraging results in retinal cell models suggest a promising avenue for studies in dry AMD patients harboring MERTK nonsense mutations (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2010).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Ataluren functions by modulating the ribosomal machinery so that premature termination codons (PTCs) – which normally trigger the recruitment of the release factors eRF1 and eRF3 leading to rapid translation termination – are instead bypassed via read-through (Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 7–8; Richardson et al., 2017, pp. 8–11). In cells harboring nonsense mutations, this drug facilitates the accommodation of near-cognate aminoacyl transfer RNAs at the site of the premature stop codon, allowing the ribosome to continue translation through to the natural termination codon, and thereby synthesizing a full-length polypeptide with a single amino acid substitution at the mutation site (Michorowska, 2021, pp. 1–2; Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 7–8).
In contrast to aminoglycosides that bind strongly to the ribosomal decoding center and are associated with off-target toxicity due to inadvertent effects on mitochondrial protein synthesis (Nagel-Wolfrum et al., 2014, pp. 6–7), Ataluren appears to selectively influence the translational fidelity at PTCs while sparing normal stop codons (Richardson et al., 2017, pp. 14–17). Its mechanism does not completely inhibit translation termination but extends the temporal window during which near-cognate tRNA incorporation can occur. This selective process is believed to be highly dependent on the specific mRNA sequence context surrounding the PTC (Tutone et al., 2019, pp. 3–5). Notably, Ataluren’s ability to promote read-through is most effective in certain sequence contexts – for example, when the PTC is UGA, followed by cytosine, which is a context known to have higher natural read-through rates (Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 7–8).
Additionally, Ataluren may reduce the efficiency of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a surveillance pathway that usually degrades transcripts harboring PTCs, thereby increasing the pool of mutant transcripts that can be acted on by the ribosome (Wang et al., 2020, pp. 10–11). In retinal cells, especially in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) where MERTK plays a critical role in the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments, this mechanistic action is of particular interest. MERTK is abundantly expressed in the RPE and is essential for maintaining photoreceptor health through its regulation of phagocytic clearance; nonsense mutations in the MERTK gene disrupt this process (Ramsden et al., 2017, pp. 2–3; Nagel-Wolfrum et al., 2014, pp. 6–7). Therefore, theoretically, by binding to the translational apparatus and facilitating the bypass of the mutated stop codon, Ataluren can restore the synthesis of full-length MerTK protein, thereby reinstating its functional phagocytic capacity in RPE cells (Li et al., 2023, pp. 25–26; Richardson et al., 2017, pp. 17–20).

Expected Effect:
The primary hypothesis behind repurposing Ataluren for dry AMD is that it will enable the read-through of nonsense mutations in the MERTK transcripts within RPE cells. Experimental evidence in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE models from carriers of nonsense MERTK mutations has already shown promising results; in an assay using a concentration of 10 μg/mL Ataluren, restoration of MerTK protein expression reached approximately 65% of wild-type levels, with a concomitant 48% improvement in FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segment (POS) uptake (Ramsden et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Michorowska, 2021, pp. 23–24). This suggests that by restoring sufficient levels of functional MerTK protein, Ataluren could rescue the impaired phagocytic function seen in the RPE cells of patients with nonsense MERTK variants.
In practical terms, the expected effect in the proposed assay is twofold. First, there should be a biochemical restoration of full-length MerTK protein as determined by techniques such as Western blot analysis or immunocytochemistry; second, functional assays that assess the phagocytic uptake of fluorescently labeled POS should demonstrate a significant improvement over baseline levels observed in the absence of the drug (Ramsden, 2017, pp. 216–221; Richardson et al., 2017, pp. 17–20). Given that proper phagocytosis by RPE cells is crucial for maintaining retinal homeostasis and that phagocytic failure is a key contributor to dry AMD pathogenesis, restoring even partial MerTK function may have profound therapeutic benefits. In addition, the established oral safety profile of Ataluren from its use in DMD trials supports its potential to be translated into human studies with acceptable tolerability, making it a viable candidate for repurposing to treat AMD patients with the specific genetic defect in MERTK (Michorowska, 2021, pp. 18–19; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, Ataluren presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD in patients harboring nonsense mutations in the MERTK gene. Its major strength lies in its mechanistic rationale: by promoting ribosomal read-through of PTCs, Ataluren directly addresses the underlying genetic defect that leads to truncated, nonfunctional MerTK protein in RPE cells (Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 7–8; Richardson et al., 2017, pp. 8–11). The ability to restore full-length protein expression and thereby improve a fundamental RPE function—phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments—offers a targeted, personalized therapeutic intervention for a subset of dry AMD patients genetically validated to have MERTK deficits (Li et al., 2023, pp. 25–26; Ramsden et al., 2017, pp. 1–2).

One significant advantage is Ataluren’s favorable safety and tolerability profile observed in extensive clinical trials for DMD and CF. The oral administration route and long-term safety make Ataluren an attractive option compared to other TRIDs, particularly aminoglycosides, which are burdened by toxicity issues including ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Its non-aminoglycoside nature also suggests reduced risk of retinal toxicity, an important consideration when targeting ocular tissues (Nagel-Wolfrum et al., 2014, pp. 1–2; Michorowska, 2021, pp. 1–2).

However, there are weaknesses and challenges to consider. The efficacy of translational read-through is highly dependent on codon context; not all nonsense mutations are equally amenable to read-through, and the sequence surrounding the premature stop codon can influence the efficiency of aminoacyl-tRNA insertion (Tutone et al., 2019, pp. 3–5; Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 7–8). In the case of MERTK, while data from iPSC-RPE models are promising, variability in read-through efficiency may translate into only partial restoration of protein function, which might not be sufficient to completely halt disease progression in dry AMD. Additionally, the ability of Ataluren to cross the blood-retinal barrier remains a concern. Although studies in other ocular disease models have employed topical formulations or systemic dosing with success, additional work will be required to optimize drug delivery specifically to RPE cells in the human retina (Torriano et al., 2018, pp. 13–14; Richardson et al., 2017, pp. 17–20).

Another challenge lies in the interplay with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Since NMD degrades transcripts that harbor PTCs, the available mRNA pool for read-through may be limited. Some studies have considered combining TRIDs like Ataluren with agents that inhibit NMD (e.g., Amlexanox) to maximize the therapeutic benefit (Wang et al., 2020, pp. 10–11). Such combination strategies might be necessary for dry AMD cases where NMD efficiency is high, though these approaches would add complexity to clinical treatment protocols (Wang et al., 2020, pp. 7–9).

Lastly, although Ataluren has been clinically validated for other indications, there is currently no direct clinical trial data for its use in dry AMD or specifically in patients with MERTK nonsense mutations. Further preclinical studies, ideally in animal models recapitulating MERTK nonsense-associated RPE dysfunction, will be essential to bridge the translational gap and confirm both the efficacy and safety of this repurposed therapeutic in the context of dry AMD (Li et al., 2023, pp. 12–13; Ramsden et al., 2017, pp. 2–3).

In summary, Ataluren’s strengths include its well-characterized mechanism enabling read-through of premature stop codons, an excellent oral safety profile demonstrated in large clinical trials for DMD and CF, and encouraging preliminary data in relevant retinal cell models that show restoration of MerTK expression and phagocytic function (Ramsden et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Michorowska, 2021, pp. 22–23). Its weaknesses primarily rest in the variability of read-through efficacy due to nucleotide context, potential challenges in ocular drug delivery, and the modulation of NMD which may limit drug substrate availability. Despite these challenges, the overall evaluation supports further investigation of Ataluren as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD in genetically defined subsets of patients with MERTK nonsense mutations, given its molecular rationale and demonstrated translational potential in restoring RPE function (Li et al., 2023, pp. 25–26; Richardson et al., 2017, pp. 17–20).

MitoQ (mitoquinone; Aviva Systems Biology Cat# OX1125),"Proposal for MitoQ (mitoquinone; Aviva Systems Biology Cat# OX1125)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MitoQ (mitoquinone) is a synthetic derivative of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) engineered for mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant therapy. It is produced by conjugating a ubiquinone moiety to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation, which exploits the mitochondrial membrane potential for preferential uptake into mitochondria. In so doing, MitoQ overcomes the suboptimal absorption and distribution of native CoQ10 by ensuring that the antioxidant is delivered directly into the inner mitochondrial membrane where reactive oxygen species (ROS) are predominantly generated. MitoQ belongs to the class of mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants—a group that includes other compounds like idebenone and SkQ1—and is designed to quench lipid‐derived ROS, stabilize mitochondrial membranes, and maintain mitochondrial bioenergetics. This class of therapeutic compounds has been widely investigated across biomedical research to counteract oxidative stress–mediated cellular dysfunction in various diseases. The synthesis of MitoQ involves standard organic coupling procedures to attach the triphenylphosphonium cation to the CoQ10 derivative, yielding a molecule that is both chemically stable and capable of systemic administration while achieving intracellular and intramitochondrial accumulation (Osborne et al., 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
MitoQ has undergone extensive preclinical and clinical evaluation in various conditions characterized by mitochondrial oxidative stress. Historically, MitoQ has been evaluated in clinical trials for conditions such as fatigue in multiple sclerosis (Yadav, 2018) and for mitigating vascular dysfunction in aging populations (University of Colorado, Denver, 2023; Al-Naggar, 2024), thereby supporting its safety profile and demonstrating measurable tissue accumulation following oral dosing (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Although MitoQ itself has not been directly approved nor widely clinically tested for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), its therapeutic class has been explored in analogous conditions where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role, such as in diabetic retinopathy and other retinal degenerative diseases. Preclinical studies using rodent models have shown that mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants can improve retinal function and reduce drusen‐like deposits. In several rodent models of retinal degeneration, antioxidants similar in mechanism to MitoQ have provided protection of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and preserved photoreceptor function (Han, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, compounds such as SkQ1 have been used to mitigate AMD‐like retinopathy in OXYS rats (Muraleva et al., 2014); although these studies do not evaluate MitoQ directly, they underscore the promise of targeting mitochondrial ROS for treating retinal degenerations. Thus, while the direct therapeutic history of MitoQ in dry AMD remains to be fully established, the cumulative evidence from its use in other oxidative stress–related disorders and its ability to produce significant tissue levels in the retina support its further evaluation in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ji et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
MitoQ’s therapeutic rationale hinges on its ability to selectively accumulate within mitochondria, where it acts as a potent antioxidant and modulator of mitochondrial quality control. Its lipophilic triphenylphosphonium component allows for a several‐hundred‐fold accumulation within the mitochondrial matrix, driven by the negative mitochondrial membrane potential. Once inside the mitochondria, the ubiquinone moiety of MitoQ is reduced by complex II of the electron transport chain (ETC) to its active ubiquinol form. This reduced form then functions to detoxify reactive oxygen species, particularly lipid peroxyl radicals generated during oxidative processes, thereby preventing lipid peroxidation of mitochondrial membranes. Consequently, MitoQ preserves mitochondrial dynamics by maintaining membrane integrity and normal electron flow through the ETC, which is critical for ATP production and overall cellular bioenergetics (Osborne et al., 2014; Ji et al., 2021).

On the molecular level, the reduction in mitochondrial ROS exerts downstream effects that include reduced priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a multiprotein complex that, when activated, triggers inflammatory cascades known to contribute to RPE degeneration and dry AMD pathogenesis. By mitigating ROS levels, MitoQ decreases inadvertent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby dampening chronic inflammation within the retina (Datta et al., 2023; Brooks et al., 2023). Furthermore, reduced oxidative stress is anticipated to have a positive effect on cellular autophagy; RPE cells require efficient autophagic clearance of damaged cellular components and photoreceptor outer segments (POS) to maintain homeostasis. MitoQ, by safeguarding mitochondrial function and preventing excessive ROS-induced damage, supports lysosomal integrity and enhances autophagic flux, which is essential for proper POS phagocytosis (Zhang et al., 2023; Brooks et al., 2023). In addition, the preservation of mitochondrial dynamics, including balanced fission and fusion events, is critical for the maintenance of cellular energy levels and for initiating mitophagy—the selective removal of damaged mitochondria—which has been shown to be impaired in aging RPE (Datta et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2021). In summary, MitoQ’s molecular interactions range from direct ROS scavenging to the modulation of inflammatory and autophagic pathways that are directly implicated in dry AMD pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Osborne et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
Based on the described mechanism of action, the expected therapeutic effect of MitoQ in dry AMD is multifaceted. First, by accumulating in RPE mitochondria and neutralizing lipid‐derived ROS, MitoQ is anticipated to reduce oxidative damage that would otherwise compromise mitochondrial membrane potential and lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. This is critical because diseased RPE cells in dry AMD display elevated ROS levels that destabilize mitochondrial membranes and reduce ATP production (Han, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Second, the reduction in mitochondrial ROS is expected to prevent the priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Since excessive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is linked to chronic inflammation and subsequent degeneration within the RPE, reducing its activation should attenuate inflammatory signaling cascades and slow the progression of AMD‐associated atrophy (Datta et al., 2023; Brooks et al., 2023). Third, the maintenance of mitochondrial dynamics and the preservation of autophagic efficacy are predicted to enhance the RPE’s capacity for photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagocytosis. Efficient POS clearance is essential for retinal homeostasis, and its failure is a hallmark in the development of drusen and other pathologic deposits typical of dry AMD (Ji et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023). Moreover, enhanced autophagy and lysosomal integrity are crucial for the clearance of oxidatively‐damaged organelles and aggregated proteins, thus helping to maintain cellular health in an environment of chronic oxidative stress (Brooks et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024). Preclinical evidence in rodent models further supports that mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants can improve retinal function and reduce drusen-like deposits, setting a strong precedent for the utility of MitoQ in preserving RPE function (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Han, 2018). On an assay level, one would expect to observe reduced markers of oxidative stress (e.g., lipid peroxidation products), lower levels of NLRP3 inflammasome activation (as measured by caspase-1 activity and IL-1β secretion), improvement in mitochondrial respiratory function, and enhanced autophagic flux when MitoQ is tested in RPE cell cultures or preclinical animal models of dry AMD (Datta et al., 2023; Brooks et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
In our comprehensive review, MitoQ emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD based on its targeted mechanism, supportive preclinical evidence, and favorable pharmacokinetic profile demonstrated in other conditions. One strength of MitoQ is its ability to accumulate selectively in mitochondria, where it effectively reduces lipid-derived ROS and thus addresses the upstream initiators of the cascade leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammasome activation, and compromised autophagy in the RPE (Osborne et al., 2014; Ji et al., 2021). The compound’s established safety in clinical trials for other indications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) and measurable tissue uptake provide additional support for its repurposing in ocular diseases, including dry AMD (Datta et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2021). Furthermore, by mitigating the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, MitoQ targets one of the crucial inflammatory mechanisms implicated in RPE degeneration, which may translate into reduced chronic inflammation and slower disease progression. Its role in supporting autophagic and lysosomal integrity is particularly relevant given that impaired phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments is a known contributor to drusen formation and RPE dysfunction (Zhang et al., 2023; Brooks et al., 2023).

However, several weaknesses or challenges remain. Direct clinical evidence of MitoQ’s effects in dry AMD is currently lacking; most of the supportive data are derived from analogous preclinical studies and the use of similar compounds in related retinal models. While rodent models and in vitro studies offer encouraging results regarding mitochondrial antioxidants, the translation of these findings into a robust clinical benefit in human AMD remains to be demonstrated. Additionally, the complex etiology of dry AMD—which involves genetic predisposition, environmental stresses, and multiple cellular pathways—suggests that a single‐target approach, even one as central as mitochondrial ROS reduction, may need to be combined with other therapeutic strategies to achieve a significant clinical effect (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Al-Naggar, 2024). Moreover, potential off-target effects and the long-term safety of chronic MitoQ administration in the retina must be thoroughly evaluated, despite its favorable safety profile in systemic applications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Han, 2018; Datta et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2021).

Overall, the evidence from mitochondrial biology, preclinical rodent models, and parallel human clinical trials in other conditions provide a compelling rationale to advance MitoQ for dry AMD. Its strengths lie in its targeted mechanism, established pharmacokinetics, and the centrality of mitochondrial dysfunction in AMD pathogenesis, whereas the main weakness is the current gap in direct clinical validation for AMD. Given the significant unmet medical need in dry AMD, MitoQ represents a promising candidate that merits further investigation through rigorous preclinical studies in retinal models followed by targeted clinical trials to assess efficacy and safety in AMD patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Han, 2018; Datta et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2021).

Everolimus (RAD001),"Proposal for Everolimus (RAD001)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Everolimus (RAD001) is a synthetic derivative of rapamycin that belongs to the class of mTOR inhibitors, specifically targeting mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). It was originally isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus and later modified chemically by Novartis to improve its pharmacokinetic profile, solubility, and bioavailability. Everolimus is well characterized for its immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties and has been approved for various indications such as organ transplantation and certain cancers, placing it among well‐established rapalogs that exert their effects by binding the intracellular protein FKBP12 and subsequently inhibiting mTORC1 activity (Walters & Cox, 2018). Its development history leverages decades of research into the mTOR pathway and the role of rapamycin analogs in modulating autophagy and cell growth, making it an attractive candidate for repurposing in chronic, age‐related diseases like dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of everolimus is extensive, with clinical use primarily in the prevention of organ transplant rejection and as an anticancer agent in renal cell carcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors. Its efficacy and safety have been evaluated in multiple clinical trials, and its immunosuppressive effects have been well documented in chronic transplant populations (Sandhu et al., 2018). Although everolimus has not been extensively used in dry AMD per se, its close relative rapamycin has been studied in preclinical models of retinal degeneration; for instance, rapamycin and its analogs have demonstrated benefits in preventing AMD‐like retinopathy in animal models, particularly through enhancing autophagic flux and reducing oxidative stress in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells (Kolosova et al., 2012). Furthermore, early‐phase clinical trials with related mTOR inhibitors in ocular conditions—such as the phase 2 study evaluating everolimus for neovascular AMD—provide supportive background for the potential repurposing of everolimus for dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2009; McGimpsey & Chakravarthy, 2010). This history creates a logical bridge indicating that the biochemical and cellular actions of rapamycin analogs, including everolimus, might extend their therapeutic benefits to dry AMD, despite limited direct clinical use in this indication so far (Chang et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
Everolimus exerts its effects by binding to the immunophilin FK506‐binding protein 12 (FKBP12), forming a complex that allosterically inhibits mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). This inhibition results in decreased phosphorylation of key downstream effectors such as S6 kinase and 4E‐BP1, which in turn leads to reduced protein synthesis, cellular growth, and potentially excessive cellular proliferation (Walters & Cox, 2018). At the biochemical level, mTORC1 is a critical negative regulator of autophagy; its hyperactivation in aged RPE cells is implicated in the pathogenesis of dry AMD since it prevents the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), ultimately reducing lysosomal enzyme production and impairing the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. Everolimus thereby is expected to relieve this inhibition, promoting autophagic flux as evidenced by increased LC3‐II levels, upregulated LAMP2 expression, and enhanced lysosomal biogenesis, which are essential for maintaining RPE cell homeostasis (Kaarniranta et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022). Additionally, by allowing TFEB to translocate into the nucleus, everolimus is hypothesized to restore the synthesis of lysosomal proteins necessary for effective degradation of lipofuscin‐like granules and other intracellular waste products, thus mitigating the cellular dysfunction observed in dry AMD (Chang et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
The working hypothesis for using everolimus in dry AMD is that its mTORC1 inhibition will lead to suppression of hyperactive mTOR signaling in aged RPE cells, which otherwise sequesters TFEB in the cytoplasm, thereby impairing lysosomal function and autophagy. In cellular models of AMD, the anticipated biochemical changes include increased levels of autophagy markers such as LC3‐II and enhanced expression of lysosomal proteins like LAMP2. These changes are expected to drive significant improvements in the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, thereby reducing the accumulation of toxic lipofuscin deposits that are a hallmark of dry AMD pathology (Chang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). Preclinical evidence in Abca4−/− mice has demonstrated that systemic treatment with everolimus can reduce lipofuscin‐like granule accumulation by approximately 40% and improve retinal functional responses as determined by electroretinography (McGimpsey & Chakravarthy, 2010). This suggests that, even if administered systemically at doses optimized for ocular exposure, everolimus may exert neuroprotective and restorative effects on RPE cells by enhancing their autophagic capacity and lysosomal degradation pathways, thereby preventing further degeneration of the outer retina (Kaarniranta et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, everolimus represents a promising candidate for repurposing as a treatment for dry AMD, primarily based on its well‐established mechanism of mTORC1 inhibition and its documented ability to enhance autophagy and lysosomal function. One of the major strengths of everolimus is its extensive clinical use history in other indications, which provides a robust safety profile and well‐characterized pharmacokinetic data that can facilitate rapid translation into ophthalmic applications (Sandhu et al., 2018; McGimpsey & Chakravarthy, 2010). Its ability to modulate mTOR signaling, decrease aberrant protein synthesis, and ultimately restore the activity of the autophagy–lysosome pathway addresses a key pathogenic mechanism in dry AMD, where impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in RPE cells leads to the pathological buildup of lipofuscin and subsequent cellular stress (Chang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). However, weaknesses include the lack of extensive direct clinical evidence in dry AMD and the potential risks associated with systemic mTOR inhibition, such as immunosuppression, metabolic disturbances, and possible off‐target effects that might affect ocular tissues adversely if not properly dosed (Sandhu et al., 2018; McGimpsey & Chakravarthy, 2010). Moreover, while preclinical animal studies offer promising results, the link between improved autophagic markers in RPE cells and clinically meaningful outcomes in patients with dry AMD remains to be conclusively demonstrated (Kaarniranta et al., 2023; Kolosova et al., 2012). The proposed mechanism, however, is highly specific and offers a targeted approach at a validated control node for autophagy regulation, which could be a significant advantage for a condition that currently lacks effective treatment options (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chang et al., 2022). In conclusion, while further rigorous preclinical and clinical studies are essential to confirm the efficacy of everolimus for dry AMD, the mechanistic rationale and supporting preclinical data present a compelling case for its potential as a therapeutic candidate in this challenging disease area (Wang et al., 2022).

AICAR (5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide),"Proposal for AICAR (5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
AICAR (5‐Aminoimidazole‐4‐carboxamide ribonucleotide) is a synthetic nucleotide analog originally discovered as an intermediate in purine biosynthesis that has been repurposed as a pharmacological activator of AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Theodoropoulou et al., 2013). As a nucleoside analog, AICAR is taken up into cells via adenosine transporters and subsequently phosphorylated by adenosine kinase into ZMP, an analog of AMP. This conversion mimics a high intracellular AMP/ATP ratio—a signal of energy stress—thereby activating AMPK (Al‐Moujahed et al., 2014). Compounds belonging to this class have historically been used as metabolic modulators in studies of cellular energy homeostasis, as well as in preclinical oncology and inflammatory disease models, positioning them as valuable tools for probing metabolic pathways across a range of diseases. In essence, AICAR belongs to a class of compounds that modulate cellular metabolism through direct engagement of AMPK, and its synthesis and biochemical processing make it representative of nontraditional therapeutics that repurpose metabolic stress signals for therapeutic gain (Theodoropoulou et al., 2013).

Therapeutic History:
AICAR has been widely used in preclinical studies to investigate its anti‐proliferative, anti‐inflammatory, and metabolic regulatory effects. In oncology research, AICAR has been administered to inhibit cell growth in various cancer cell lines, including retinoblastoma and uveal melanoma (Theodoropoulou et al., 2010; Al‐Moujahed et al., 2014). In the context of ocular diseases, studies have demonstrated its capacity to suppress inflammatory cytokine production in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and reduce complement activation (Chung et al., 2017). Beyond oncology and inflammation, AICAR has been explored in models of metabolic dysfunction and retinal degeneration since AMPK activation is known to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and modulate autophagy, both processes critically involved in retinal health (Zhang et al., 2020). Although AICAR itself has not been tested extensively in clinical trials specifically for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), its use as an experimental probe in diverse retinal models—including diabetic retinopathy, endotoxin‐induced uveitis, and mitochondrial dysfunction in iPSC‐derived RPE cells—provides a foundation for hypothesizing its utility in dry AMD (Ebeling et al., 2022; Chan et al., 2020). In addition, clinical observations in conditions linked to inflammatory and metabolic dysregulation—such as the obesity‐related clinical trial that evaluated AMPK activators including AICAR in ex vivo human adipose macrophage assays (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—underscore its potential wider therapeutic applicability. In summary, although AICAR’s clinical use has been predominantly investigational and confined to preclinical models of various diseases, its robust record as an activator of AMPK in ocular and systemic models creates a compelling rationale for further investigation in dry AMD.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, AICAR functions by entering the cell through nucleoside transporters and undergoing phosphorylation by adenosine kinase to form ZMP, a direct mimetic of AMP (Al‐Moujahed et al., 2014; Theodoropoulou et al., 2013). This accumulation of ZMP results in the activation of the AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex, a heterotrimeric serine/threonine kinase that comprises a catalytic α subunit along with regulatory β and γ subunits (Kumar et al., 2016). Once activated, AMPK orchestrates a wide range of cellular responses that restore energy balance. Key among these is the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway through phosphorylation of downstream targets such as TSC2 and Raptor, ultimately leading to decreased phosphorylation of mTOR effectors including 4E‐BP1 and ribosomal protein S6 (Al‐Moujahed et al., 2014; Matoba et al., 2017). Inhibition of mTORC1 is closely coupled with the induction of autophagy, as suppression of mTOR removes a well‐established blockade on autophagosomal formation. This interplay between AMPK and mTOR is critical in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a cell type that is notoriously vulnerable to both oxidative stress and the cumulative burden of waste products such as photoreceptor outer segments (POS) (Chung et al., 2017; Ebeling et al., 2022). Moreover, AMPK activation by AICAR leads to reduced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and suppression of inflammatory signaling pathways, including inhibition of NF‐κB and MAPK cascades, which are implicated in retinal inflammatory processes (Kamoshita et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2017). In retinal models, these actions not only preserve cell viability by enhancing autophagic clearance but also improve barrier function and metabolic homeostasis (Ebeling et al., 2022). In sum, the known mechanism of action of AICAR entails its intracellular conversion to ZMP, subsequent activation of AMPK, inhibition of the mTOR pathway, and stimulation of autophagy—all of which are molecular events that are favorable for mitigating the metabolic stress and inflammatory burden seen in dry AMD.

Expected Effect:
Based on the mechanistic insights and supporting preclinical studies, the hypothesis posits that in RPE cells, AICAR will stimulate AMPK activation leading to the inhibition of mTORC1, thereby inducing autophagy‐mediated clearance of harmful cellular aggregates such as photoreceptor outer segments (POS). Studies in ARPE‐19 cells—an established in vitro model for RPE function—have demonstrated that under stress conditions mimicking AMD pathology, treatment with AICAR (at a concentration of 1 mM) increases levels of the autophagosome marker LC3‐II by approximately 2.5-fold (Chung et al., 2017). This upregulation of LC3‐II is indicative of enhanced autophagy, which is critical for degrading and recycling damaged cellular components. Concurrent with the increase in autophagy markers, AICAR treatment was observed to restore lysosomal pH homeostasis and improve the phagocytic uptake of fluorescently labeled photoreceptor outer segments (FITC‐POS), with an enhancement reported to be around 42 % (Ebeling et al., 2022). In primary human RPE cells, similar effects were found, including improved barrier function and reduced ROS generation (Chung et al., 2017; Ebeling et al., 2022). Because autophagy and lysosomal degradation are fundamental to maintaining RPE cell health in the face of constant POS phagocytosis, this mechanism is particularly relevant to dry AMD, whose pathogenesis involves both impaired autophagic clearance and subsequent cellular stress. Importantly, the expression of AMPK in RPE cells has been well‐documented, and its activation correlates with enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced inflammatory markers (Zhang et al., 2020; Ebeling et al., 2022). Hence, the expected effect of AICAR in the proposed assay is multifold: stimulation of AMPK will lead to mTOR inhibition and consequent autophagosome formation, restoration of lysosomal acidification, enhanced degradation of photoreceptor debris, and overall improved cellular resilience and function. The cumulative result of these actions is anticipated to reduce the pathological accumulation of waste products in dry AMD and maintain or restore the integrity of the RPE layer.

Overall Evaluation:
The repurposing of AICAR for dry AMD presents several compelling strengths as well as notable challenges. On the strength side, AICAR offers clear mechanistic target engagement; its capacity to activate AMPK and simultaneously inhibit mTOR has been demonstrated in multiple ocular cell models (Chung et al., 2017; Al‐Moujahed et al., 2014). This dual action is highly relevant to the pathophysiology of dry AMD, where impaired autophagy and chronic oxidative stress contribute to RPE dysfunction. Preclinical data in ARPE‐19 cells stressed with A2E, a toxic bisretinoid that accumulates in RPE cells and is implicated in AMD, indicate that AICAR treatment significantly increases autophagy markers and improves functional endpoints like phagocytosis and lysosomal pH restoration (Ebeling et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2017). Moreover, primary human RPE assays corroborate these findings by showing improved barrier function and reduced reactive oxygen species generation after AICAR treatment (Chung et al., 2017).

However, several challenges and weaknesses must be considered. First, while the in vitro and ex vivo data in RPE models are promising, there remains a paucity of direct preclinical in vivo evidence specific to dry AMD. For example, most of the studies cited focus on inflammatory models, retinal tumors, or general mitochondrial dysfunction, rather than on chronic degenerative models that recapitulate the full complexity of dry AMD pathology (Zhang et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020). Second, the clinical use of AICAR is currently limited, and its pharmacokinetic profile, bioavailability, and potential systemic side effects require thorough characterization before it can be safely applied in an ocular setting. Although some studies have reported low toxicity in animal models at relatively high doses (Al‐Moujahed et al., 2014), translation to human patients, particularly in a chronic disease like AMD, may necessitate significant optimization or the development of analogs with improved ocular specificity. Third, the complexity of the AMPK/mTOR/autophagy axis implies that responses to AICAR may be highly context‐dependent. For instance, metformin—another AMPK activator—has shown paradoxical effects in retinal cells by exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction under certain stress conditions (Chan et al., 2020). This underscores the need for caution in selecting the appropriate dosing regimen and administration route. Fourth, while the evidence supports improved autophagy markers, enhanced LC3‐II conversion, and restoration of lysosomal pH in cell culture, the exact dynamics of photoreceptor outer segment clearance in vivo, and how these effects translate to meaningful clinical benefit in dry AMD patients, remain to be fully demonstrated. Finally, the potential for compensatory feedback mechanisms in chronic disease states may diminish the long‐term efficacy of AICAR if such feedback is not concurrently modulated.

In conclusion, AICAR is a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for dry AMD based on its well‐documented mode of action as an AMPK activator, its capacity to inhibit mTOR signaling, and its ability to stimulate autophagy—mechanisms that are directly relevant to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Chung et al., 2017; Ebeling et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2021). The preclinical evidence—particularly improved autophagosome formation, restoration of lysosomal pH, enhanced phagocytosis of POS, and reduction in oxidative stress in RPE cells—provides a strong mechanistic rationale for further development of AICAR or optimized analogs (Ebeling et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the transition from mechanistic probe to clinically viable therapeutic will require rigorous exploration of its pharmacodynamics in ocular tissues, careful dose optimization to minimize potential systemic adverse effects, and validation in relevant in vivo models that recapitulate the chronic degenerative aspects of dry AMD (Zhang et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020). Overall, while limitations exist—most notably the lack of direct in vivo data in dry AMD models and potential safety concerns—the strong preclinical mechanistic and functional data support the pursuit of AICAR as a valuable candidate for further investigation in dry AMD drug development.

Recombinant human MFG-E8 (Milk fat globule–epidermal growth factor 8; Sino Biological Cat# 10051-H08H) is a bioengineered version of a naturally secreted glycoprotein originally isolated as a component of the milk fat globule membrane. This glycoprotein belongs to the EGF–like domain protein family and is characterized by its unique structural motifs including N-terminal epidermal growth factor–like repeats and C-terminal discoidin-like domains that bear homology to blood coagulation factors V and VIII; these domains confer its ability to interact with cell surface integrins via an RGD (Arg–Gly–Asp) motif and to bind specific phospholipids found on the surface of apoptotic cells. Recombinant human MFG-E8 is produced using established recombinant DNA technology, typically in mammalian cell expression systems that allow for proper folding, post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, and secretion of a protein that closely mimics the native molecule. As a member of the opsonin class, this therapeutic candidate is designed to “bridge” apoptotic cells to phagocytes through integrin recognition, a mechanism that has been harnessed in various therapeutic explorations; its class of secreted glycoproteins has previously been implicated in promoting apoptotic cell clearance and modulating inflammatory responses in multiple tissues (Meshikhes, 2015).

Therapeutic History:
MFG-E8 has been extensively studied over the years in the context of both inflammatory and degenerative diseases, and its recombinant form has been evaluated in a range of preclinical disease models. In biochemical and cellular studies, the protein has been shown to facilitate phagocytosis by bridging phosphatidylserine residues on apoptotic cells (or debris) to integrin receptors such as αvβ5 present on phagocytic cells, a property that is critical for the clearance of dying cells in tissues including the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Klettner et al., 2013). Although recombinant human MFG-E8 has not yet reached widespread clinical use specifically for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), its therapeutic potential is supported by multiple experimental studies in other inflammatory and degenerative conditions such as sepsis, colitis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, as well as in models of neurodegeneration, where exogenous supplementation restored impaired phagocytosis and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Veterinary applications have also been explored in disease models where tissue injury and impaired clearance contribute to pathology, suggesting that the broad pharmacological profile of recombinant MFG-E8 is adaptable to multiple indications (Meshikhes, 2015). In the context of retinal degeneration, particularly in dry AMD—a disease characterized by RPE dysfunction and accumulation of photoreceptor outer segment (POS) debris—preclinical models have demonstrated that impaired phagocytosis correlates with disease progression, thereby validating MFG-E8’s potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate; several studies report that boosting MFG-E8 levels can restore POS uptake and promote retinal homeostasis under stress conditions (Pay, 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of recombinant human MFG-E8 is well defined at the molecular level. Under normal conditions, the RPE cells perform daily phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments (POS), a process critical for maintaining retinal homeostasis; this phagocytic function is mediated in part by the αvβ5 integrin receptor. MFG-E8 facilitates this process by acting as a bridging molecule that binds to externalized phosphatidylserine on POS through its C-terminal regions while simultaneously engaging the αvβ5 integrin receptor on RPE cells via its RGD domain located in the N-terminal EGF-like domain. This dual-binding capability initiates integrin clustering and triggers downstream intracellular signaling cascades, including the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Rac1, which together orchestrate actin cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for the engulfment and internalization of POS. Experimental models have shown that oxidative stress, a primary contributor to dry AMD pathology, impairs the αvβ5 integrin-mediated phagocytic process; however, supplementation with recombinant MFG-E8 has been observed to restore POS uptake and normalize levels of phosphorylated FAK, indicating that the protein can overcome oxidative inhibition and re-establish efficient phagocytosis (Basyal et al., 2024; Si et al., 2023). In addition, knockdown studies report reductions in phagocytosis by more than 50% when MFG-E8 levels are diminished, which further supports the hypothesis that MFG-E8 is a critical mediator of this process (Klettner et al., 2013). The specificity of MFG-E8 for the early steps of phagocytic recognition—rather than broadly activating phagocytic pathways—distinguishes it from other agents that may modulate RPE function more generally, thereby making it an attractive therapeutic candidate for conditions in which initial binding deficits lead to disease progression (Oshima et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
Based on its well‐characterized mechanism, the expected effect of recombinant human MFG-E8 supplementation in dry AMD is to restore and enhance the phagocytic activity of RPE cells. In a well‐designed assay employing RPE cells under conditions of oxidative stress (an AMD-like environment), the administration of recombinant human MFG-E8 is anticipated to increase POS binding and uptake, primarily via the specific engagement of the αvβ5 integrin receptor. The anticipated downstream activation of FAK and Rac1 should further confirm that the MFG-E8–integrin interaction is re‐initiating cytoskeletal reorganization necessary for efficient phagocytosis. Given that previous studies have documented a significant reduction in phagocytic efficiency upon MFG-E8 knockdown—with subsequent rescue upon recombinant protein administration—the hypothesis that MFG-E8 supplementation will improve RPE clearance function is well supported (Basyal et al., 2024; Inana et al., 2018). Moreover, this mechanistic action is expected to mitigate accumulations of damaged or non-internalized POS that contribute to the formation of drusen, a pathological hallmark of dry AMD, thereby potentially slowing or reversing disease progression. Since RPE cells are known to express the αvβ5 integrin receptor robustly and depend on MFG-E8 for efficient phagocytosis, restoring its levels is likely to yield beneficial effects in maintaining retinal homeostasis (Si et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
After an extensive review of the biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature, recombinant human MFG-E8 emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing towards the treatment of dry AMD. The principal strengths of this therapeutic candidate are centered on its specific mechanism of action, which targets the early phase of phagocytic recognition—an area that is notably compromised in dry AMD. By binding photoreceptor outer segments via phosphatidylserine and engaging the αvβ5 integrin on RPE cells, MFG-E8 not only facilitates the clearance of cellular debris but also effectively triggers the intracellular signaling responses (via FAK and Rac1 activation) essential for actin cytoskeletal rearrangement and successful phagocytosis (Basyal et al., 2024; Si et al., 2023). This specificity distinguishes it from more generalized approaches that aim merely to enhance overall phagocytic capacity or reduce oxidative stress without correcting the underlying binding deficit.

A further strength is the robust preclinical evidence supporting the role of MFG-E8 in maintaining retinal homeostasis under conditions of oxidative stress, a major pathogenic factor in dry AMD. Experimental models demonstrate that oxidative damage results in impaired MFG-E8 function and reduced phagocytosis, both of which can be rescued by exogenous administration of recombinant protein. Such data are compelling because they suggest that MFG-E8 therapy could correct the initial cellular defects that trigger a cascade of retinal deterioration. Moreover, recombinant human MFG-E8 has been well characterized in several other disease models ranging from autoimmune conditions and sepsis to ischemia-reperfusion injuries, indicating a favorable bioactivity profile and a capacity to modulate inflammation while restoring phagocytic function (Klettner et al., 2013; Meshikhes, 2015).

However, there are notable challenges and weaknesses to consider. One major limitation is that recombinant human MFG-E8 has not yet undergone rigorous clinical evaluation specifically for dry AMD. The majority of the supportive data are derived from in vitro assays and animal models, which, while promising, may not fully recapitulate the complexity of human retinal pathology. In addition, the direct involvement of MFG-E8 in comprehensive clinical settings remains to be validated in early-phase clinical trials. Safety and optimal dosing in the context of the human eye, particularly in the presence of chronic oxidative stress and established retinal degeneration, need to be thoroughly investigated. Moreover, the multifaceted roles of MFG-E8 in various tissues pose a theoretical risk of off-target effects, especially if systemically delivered; however, the therapeutic design may favor localized ocular application to mitigate such risks (Pay, 2017).

Another potential challenge is the possibility that the efficacy of recombinant human MFG-E8 could be limited by concomitant dysfunctions in other RPE signaling pathways, such as the MerTK-mediated phagocytic machinery. Dry AMD is a multifactorial disease, and while MFG-E8 targets a critical early step in POS clearance, other downstream defects may persist and contribute to ongoing RPE degeneration. Therefore, MFG-E8 supplementation might be most effective when used in combination with other therapies that address additional aspects of the disease pathology, such as oxidative damage or impaired autophagy (Basyal et al., 2024).

In summary, recombinant human MFG-E8 is a highly attractive candidate from both a mechanistic and translational perspective for the treatment of dry AMD. It leverages a precise biochemical mechanism—engagement of the αvβ5 integrin to facilitate phagocytosis of POS—which is crucial in maintaining retinal health and is particularly compromised in AMD. The preclinical data establishing its role in restoring impaired phagocytosis, even under oxidative stress, provide a solid foundation for its further development. Its well-defined mode of action, coupled with its established use in various inflammatory disease models, underscores its potential to fill an unmet medical need in dry AMD, where current therapies remain largely ineffective. Nonetheless, the move into clinical evaluation will require careful assessment of dosing, safety, and synergistic potential with other therapeutic modalities to address the multifactorial nature of RPE dysfunction in AMD (Klettner et al., 2013; Meshikhes, 2015; Motegi et al., 2011; Oshima et al., 2014; Si et al., 2023; Basyal et al., 2024).

VX-765 (Belnacasan),"Proposal for VX-765 (Belnacasan)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
VX-765 (Belnacasan) is a small molecule prodrug originally developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals that belongs to the peptidomimetic caspase inhibitor class. Chemically derived from a tetrapeptide sequence resembling the natural substrate of caspase-1, VX-765 is engineered to be orally bioavailable and is converted in vivo to its active metabolite VRT-043198. This active form covalently modifies the catalytic cysteine residue in the caspase-1 active site, thereby inhibiting its proteolytic function (Adriaenssens, 2017; Adamova, Kudelova, & Fleischmannova, 2015). Caspase-1 inhibitors like VX-765 have been of interest as modulators of inflammation since they prevent the cleavage and activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). The broader class of caspase inhibitors has been used in various preclinical inflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions with the goal of reducing excessive cell death and dampening inflammatory cascades (Adamova et al., 2015; Li et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of VX-765 and related caspase-1 inhibitors spans several inflammatory and autoimmune disease models. VX-765, in particular, has been evaluated in a variety of clinical settings including epilepsy, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other systemic inflammatory diseases due to its potent inhibition of caspase-1 mediated cytokine activation (Dhani, Zhao, & Zhivotovsky, 2021; Adamova et al., 2015). Although early clinical trials indicated that VX-765 could reduce plasma levels of IL-1β and related downstream inflammatory markers, some clinical programs encountered challenges such as liver toxicity when used systemically in conditions like treatment-resistant partial epilepsy (Dhani et al., 2021; Adamova et al., 2015). Importantly, while its anti-inflammatory effects have been documented in various non-ocular disease models, there is as yet no direct clinical or preclinical evidence of VX-765 being employed specifically to treat dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or similar retinal degenerative diseases. However, its mechanism of action—targeting caspase-1 to reduce IL-1β and IL-18 maturation—is mechanistically relevant to conditions such as dry AMD, where excessive activation of inflammatory pathways in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells contributes to disease pathology (Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Wooff et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
VX-765 functions by targeting caspase-1, the protease responsible for the cleavage of the biologically inactive precursors pro–IL-1β and pro–IL-18 into their mature, pro-inflammatory forms. At the molecular level, VX-765 is metabolized to VRT-043198, which binds to the catalytic cysteine residue within the active site of caspase-1. This covalent modification effectively inactivates caspase-1, thereby inhibiting downstream effects such as the activation of the inflammasome complex and the induction of pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death (Li et al., 2022; Adamova et al., 2015). Structurally, the molecule is designed to mimic the peptide sequence that caspase-1 typically recognizes, allowing it to compete with natural substrates and block their cleavage (Adriaenssens, 2017). Caspase-1 plays a central role in inflammasome signaling, a pathway that has been extensively implicated in the development of dry AMD through its activation by drusen components and other stressors in RPE cells (Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Gao, 2017). By inhibiting caspase-1, VX-765 reduces the production of IL-1β and IL-18, cytokines that are known to amplify local inflammation, disrupt phagocytic receptor expression, impair lysosomal biogenesis, and hence compromise the phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments—a key process in maintaining retinal homeostasis (Zhang et al., 2021; Wooff et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry AMD, the hypothesis posits that VX-765, by inhibiting caspase-1, will prevent the maturation and subsequent extracellular release of IL-1β from RPE cells. This is critical as the inflammatory cytokines produced as a result of caspase-1 activation are believed to drive multiple pathological mechanisms in dry AMD, including the downregulation of phagocytic receptors and lysosomal components essential for proper outer segment clearance (Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Lynn, 2018). Recent experimental data in induced pluripotent stem cell–derived RPE models exposed to A2E and drusen extracts indicate that treatment with VX-765 at a concentration of 20 μM resulted in an 85% reduction of IL-1β release, maintained levels of LC3-II (a marker of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis), and improved phagocytosis of FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segments by 36% (He et al., 2025; Bhattarai et al., 2021). These effects are expected to translate into a preservation of RPE cell function by limiting inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis and sustaining the cells’ capacity to clear photoreceptor debris. Moreover, rodent studies examining ocular safety and pharmacokinetics have reportedly demonstrated good ocular bioavailability, supporting the viability of local or systemic delivery approaches for treating dry AMD (Schwaid & Spencer, 2020; Wooff et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
The evidence in support of VX-765 as a candidate for dry AMD treatment is compelling scientifically, given the well-established role of inflammasome activation and caspase-1–mediated cytokine maturation in the pathogenesis of retinal pigment epithelial dysfunction (Chen, Rong, & Xia, 2022; Campbell & Doyle, 2013). Strengths of VX-765 include its high potency with an IC₅₀ reportedly around 7 nM for caspase-1 inhibition, its oral bioavailability, and its demonstrated ability to reduce IL-1β release significantly in RPE cell models. The compound’s mechanism—blocking caspase-1 to preserve phagocytic clearance functions and limit pyroptotic cell death—is highly relevant to the current understanding of dry AMD pathogenesis, where impaired degradation of photoreceptor outer segments and chronic low-grade inflammation are central pathological events (Chen et al., 2022; Campbell & Doyle, 2013).

However, there are several weaknesses and challenges to consider. First, while preclinical data in RPE models are promising, there is a lack of direct clinical or comprehensive preclinical studies in ocular disease settings specific to dry AMD. Although rodent safety and pharmacokinetic studies indicate good ocular bioavailability, the translation of systemic caspase-1 inhibition to localized ocular therapy remains to be thoroughly evaluated in terms of delivery route, dosing, and long-term safety (Wooff et al., 2020; Dhani et al., 2021). Additionally, earlier clinical trials of VX-765 in systemic inflammatory diseases have encountered concerns such as liver toxicity upon prolonged administration, although such safety issues may be mitigated through localized ocular delivery or alternative dosing regimens (Dhani et al., 2021; Adamova et al., 2015). There is also the potential risk of off-target effects given that caspase-1, while critical in cytokine maturation, is part of a broader family of related proteases involved in multiple cell death pathways. This could lead to unintended consequences if inhibition is not sufficiently selective (Zhang et al., 2021; Wooff et al., 2020).

Furthermore, the proposed mechanism of action relies substantially on the assumption that IL-1β is the primary driver of RPE dysfunction in dry AMD. Some literature suggests that other inflammatory mediators, such as IL-18, may also play complex roles in retinal physiology, with both protective and deleterious effects (Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Gao, 2017). Hence, complete inhibition of caspase-1 may yield mixed results if it simultaneously suppresses potentially protective cytokine pathways. Nonetheless, the demonstrated ability of VX-765 to maintain LC3-II levels and improve phagocytosis suggests that its net effect could be beneficial in preserving RPE cell homeostasis (He et al., 2025; Bhattarai et al., 2021).

In summary, VX-765 exhibits a promising mechanism of action as a selective caspase-1 inhibitor that could effectively reduce IL-1β maturation, diminish inflammasome-related pyroptotic signaling, and preserve phagocytic functions in RPE cells—all of which are central to the pathophysiology of dry AMD. While the preclinical rationale is strong and initial cell-based studies are encouraging, further work is needed to address safety concerns (particularly given historical issues with systemic administration), to optimize ocular delivery, and to conclusively demonstrate efficacy in relevant animal models of dry AMD before proceeding to clinical trials. The strengths of VX-765 lie in its precise targeting of a key inflammatory enzyme and its supportive preclinical data in RPE cell assays, while the weaknesses include the necessity for more ocular-specific pharmacokinetic data and the potential challenges associated with systemic toxicity that may affect its repurposing for dry AMD treatment (Gao, Cui, To, Cao, & Matsubara, 2018; Piippo, 2019). Overall, VX-765 remains a promising candidate that warrants further investigation with a focus on rigorous ocular preclinical studies and targeted delivery strategies to fully evaluate its therapeutic potential in dry age-related macular degeneration.

Trehalose,"Proposal for Trehalose

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Trehalose is a natural non‐reducing disaccharide found in diverse organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants, and invertebrates. It is synthesized via enzymes such as trehalose-6-phosphate synthase and trehalose phosphorylase in organisms that accumulate it as a stress protectant, although in humans trehalose is taken from the diet or administered exogenically as a therapeutic agent (Maiuolo et al., 2022). This compound belongs to the class of naturally occurring sugars with well‐recognized protein‐ and membrane‐stabilizing properties. In addition to its nutritional use as a safe food ingredient approved by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. FDA and European systems since 2000, trehalose has garnered considerable interest as an autophagy enhancer that activates cytoprotective pathways (Abokyi et al., 2020). In recent years, trehalose has emerged as a repurposed therapeutic candidate in neurodegenerative diseases due to its properties to mitigate oxidative stress and protein aggregation; this same rationale has now been extended to age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), given the shared aspects of cellular stress and autophagy dysregulation between neurodegenerative disorders and retinal diseases (Abokyi, 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Trehalose’s therapeutic history is extensive and spans preclinical studies as well as exploratory clinical investigations. It has been used clinically in ocular formulations for dry eye disease and postsurgical management after laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), and it has been explored in models of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington’s and Parkinson’s diseases (Maiuolo et al., 2022). Multiple studies have shown that trehalose can induce autophagy and upregulate lysosomal biogenesis in various cell types, including neuronal and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells (Abokyi et al., 2020). Preclinical in vitro studies using human RPE cells, such as ARPE-19 cells, have demonstrated that trehalose can reduce accumulation of lipofuscin and autofluorescent granules by enhancing the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS), which are pivotal in dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) pathogenesis (Abokyi et al., 2020). While trehalose itself has not yet been approved for the treatment of dry AMD in humans, its usage in related ocular conditions and positive outcomes in animal models of retinal degeneration provide a strong preliminary foundation for its repurposing (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, rodent pharmacokinetic studies have confirmed retinal delivery after oral administration, supporting its feasibility for ocular therapeutic strategies (carrying forward observations from relevant pharmacokinetic investigations reported in the literature, as indicated by various preclinical studies summarized in the context).

Mechanism of Action:
The molecular mechanism of trehalose in promoting cytoprotection is multifaceted and distinct from classical mTOR inhibitors. Trehalose has been shown to induce autophagy by facilitating the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), which is a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy (Abokyi et al., 2020). Under normal conditions, TFEB is retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive, phosphorylated state largely via mTORC1 activity; however, trehalose acts independently of mTOR by causing a slight disturbance in lysosomal homeostasis—likely through a mild increase in lysosomal pH or via endocytic uptake that leads to modest lysosomal stress—and this triggers the dephosphorylation and subsequent nuclear import of TFEB (Jeong et al., 2021). Once in the nucleus, TFEB binds to the coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) network of genes and upregulates key lysosomal proteins such as LAMP1 and cathepsins (e.g., CTSB), as well as autophagy markers like LC3-II and p62, thereby enhancing autophagic flux and lysosomal degradation processes (Abokyi et al., 2020; Abokyi, 2021). In RPE cells, this mechanism is particularly relevant because these cells continuously phagocytose the shed POS from photoreceptors; therefore, enriching their lysosomal capacity via TFEB activation can improve the clearance of accumulated debris, which if left unchecked, contributes to retinal degeneration in dry AMD (Abokyi, 2021). Biochemical studies in ARPE-19 cells have confirmed that trehalose treatment markedly increases autophagosome formation (as shown by increased LC3-II levels) and facilitates proteolytic degradation via the lysosomal pathway (Abokyi et al., 2020). Moreover, trehalose appears to enhance both macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) pathways, as suggested by upregulation of LAMP2 and cathepsin D, further solidifying its role as a robust autophagy enhancer that might directly benefit photoreceptor outer segment degradation in RPE cells (Abokyi, 2021).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis is that trehalose will induce TFEB nuclear translocation in RPE cells, thereby upregulating a program of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagic degradation that ultimately enhances the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. In the proposed assay, primary human RPE cultures treated with an accumulation-inducing agent such as A2E will mimic the lipofuscin buildup characteristic of dry AMD. When treated with trehalose, a reported concentration of 100 mM in these in vitro models has demonstrated a reduction in autofluorescent granules by approximately 50% and an increase in POS degradation by around 30% (Abokyi et al., 2020). This is presumably due to the upregulated lysosomal and autophagic activity mediated by TFEB nuclear translocation. Additionally, trehalose’s engagement with the proteasomal degradation system has been shown to enhance proteasomal activity, thereby contributing to the degradation of misfolded proteins without causing cytotoxicity (Abokyi, 2021). The expected effect of trehalose in the RPE assay is to restore cellular homeostasis by clearing accumulated POS and damaged proteins, thereby improving RPE cell functionality. Given that photoreceptor outer segment clearance is a critical function of RPE cells and is compromised in dry AMD, restoration of this process via trehalose-induced autophagic flux should mitigate the underlying pathogenesis of dry AMD (Abokyi et al., 2020). Furthermore, controlled dosing is essential, as studies have indicated that high doses (e.g., above 100 mM) might lead to excessive autophagy activation and even apoptotic cell death, while moderate doses (around 50 mM) are effective yet safe, providing a clear therapeutic window (Abokyi et al., 2020; Abokyi, 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating trehalose as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD, several strengths and weaknesses become apparent. One of the chief strengths of trehalose lies in its well-characterized safety profile, having been used as a food additive and in clinical formulations for ocular conditions such as dry eye disease with minimal cytotoxicity at therapeutically relevant doses (Maiuolo et al., 2022). Its natural origin and ease of formulation provide additional advantages in terms of regulatory approval and patient tolerability. Mechanistically, trehalose directly addresses key cellular dysfunctions noted in dry AMD by enhancing autophagic flux and lysosomal biogenesis through TFEB nuclear translocation, a pathway that is compromised in aging RPE cells (Abokyi et al., 2020; Abokyi, 2021). The ability to upregulate autophagy markers such as LC3-II, p62, LAMP2, and cathepsin D, alongside improved clearance of photoreceptor outer segment debris, positions trehalose as a promising candidate to restore RPE phagocytic function and mitigate oxidative stress-induced retinal degeneration (Abokyi et al., 2020; Abokyi, 2021).

However, there are weaknesses to consider. Some studies have noted that prolonged exposure to high concentrations of trehalose can induce excessive ER stress or autophagy overactivation, potentially leading to apoptotic cell death if the dosing is not carefully controlled (Abokyi, 2021). This underscores the importance of rigorous dose-ranging studies to identify the optimal concentration that enhances lysosomal flux without triggering detrimental stress responses (Abokyi et al., 2020). Additionally, while in vitro studies and rodent models have provided supportive pharmacokinetic and mechanistic evidence, the translational relevance to human dry AMD requires further validation in clinical trials, particularly given the complexity of AMD pathogenesis which involves multi-factorial components including inflammation, lipid dysregulation, and genetic susceptibility (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Vessey et al., 2022). The preclinical data also come, in part, from studies published in sources that have raised concerns regarding journal quality, necessitating independent replication in high-impact, peer-reviewed settings (Abokyi et al., 2020; Abokyi, 2021). Although preliminary studies indicate retinal delivery after oral administration, the pharmacokinetic profile in humans, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), must be clearly elucidated to guarantee adequate bioavailability in the retina (Karim et al., 2020).

Overall, trehalose presents as a plausible and mechanism-specific candidate for dry AMD therapy with several attractive attributes: it is a natural compound with an established safety record, it directly targets the dysregulated autophagy-lysosomal pathway implicated in AMD, and it has demonstrated efficacy in reducing pathological accumulations in RPE cells under oxidative stress conditions. The strategy of enhancing TFEB nuclear translocation to boost lysosomal biogenesis not only addresses the hallmark features of dry AMD—such as impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments—but also potentially ameliorates other aspects of cellular stress and protein aggregation that contribute to retinal degeneration (Abokyi, 2021; Bejarano et al., 2024). Nonetheless, the therapeutic window must be firmly established to avoid the pitfalls of excessive autophagy activation, and further validation in clinically relevant models is required to bridge the gap between preclinical promise and human efficacy. In conclusion, while there are challenges to overcome, trehalose remains a highly promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for restoring RPE function in dry AMD, meriting further investigation through well-designed preclinical studies and ultimately clinical trials to fully ascertain its efficacy and safety profile in this patient population (Vessey et al., 2022; Abokyi, 2021).

Anakinra (Kineret; Swedish Orphan Biovitrum),"Proposal for Anakinra (Kineret; Swedish Orphan Biovitrum)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Anakinra (Kineret; Swedish Orphan Biovitrum) is a recombinant protein consisting of the naturally occurring interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), a molecule originally discovered as a regulator of the excessive inflammatory effects of interleukin-1 (IL-1). It is produced through recombinant DNA technology in bacterial or mammalian cell expression systems so that the resulting protein mimics the endogenous IL-1 receptor antagonist, thereby competitively inhibiting the binding of IL-1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-1 beta (IL-1β) to the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1). This class of biologics, the IL-1 inhibitors, is widely used in inflammatory diseases. In its approved application for rheumatoid arthritis, for example, Anakinra has demonstrated significant efficacy by dampening the inflammation mediated by aberrant IL-1 signaling – a mechanistic principle that can be extended to other diseases in which IL-1 is implicated, such as various autoinflammatory disorders and possibly ocular inflammatory conditions (Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 1–2). Given its relatively small protein size, Anakinra is anticipated to achieve favorable ocular tissue diffusion when delivered intravitreally or periocularly; this potential is particularly attractive for achieving local effects in the retina.

Therapeutic History:
Anakinra was initially developed to address the dysregulated IL-1–mediated inflammation seen in rheumatoid arthritis and other systemic autoinflammatory conditions, such as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). Over the years, its safety profile has been extensively characterized during systemic administration and has shown minimal serious adverse events in these populations (Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 1–2). In the context of ocular therapeutics, IL-1 blockade has been progressively investigated as a strategy for combating a range of inflammatory eye diseases. Preclinical studies and case reports have provided early evidence that IL-1 inhibitors, including Anakinra, may reduce ocular inflammation such as uveitis, scleritis, and even dry eye disease. For example, in experimental models of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV), intravitreal Anakinra administered in a dose-dependent fashion resulted in reductions in the neovascular area, demonstrating anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic effects that are indirectly relevant to the pathogenesis of retinal degenerative diseases (Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 2–3; Campbell & Doyle, 2013, pp. 7–8). Although Anakinra has not been directly trialed in clinical studies for dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD), its repurposing for other ocular inflammatory conditions supports the plausibility of its use in diseases that share overlapping inflammatory mechanisms. Additional supportive evidence comes from preclinical studies that link IL-1β—generated downstream of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells—to chronic inflammation and cellular dysfunction in AMD (Brandstetter, 2016, pp. 102–104; Tseng, 2014, pp. 90–94). These studies imply that modulating IL-1-dependent pathways could be beneficial in preserving RPE function and retinal homeostasis in AMD.

Mechanism of Action:
On a molecular level, Anakinra exerts its therapeutic effect by competitively binding to the IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1), thereby blocking the interaction of both IL-1α and IL-1β with this receptor. Under normal conditions, activation of IL-1R1 by IL-1β leads to a cascade of intracellular signaling events, including the activation of NF-κB and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, that ultimately upregulate proinflammatory gene transcription. In dry AMD, there is increasing evidence that local factors, including oxidative stress, lipofuscin accumulation, and drusen components, activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in RPE cells; this inflammasome activation results in caspase-1–mediated cleavage of pro-IL-1β into its active form (Brandstetter, 2016, pp. 102–104; Tseng, 2014, pp. 94–99). The released IL-1β, in turn, fuels a local proinflammatory environment that perpetuates RPE dysfunction, impairs autophagic and lysosomal clearance mechanisms, and disrupts the integrin/MerTK-mediated phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS). Inhibiting IL-1 signaling with Anakinra would therefore theoretically interrupt this self-amplifying cascade. By binding to IL-1 receptors, Anakinra prevents IL-1β from triggering downstream inflammatory pathways such as those leading to the secretion of other proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-8) and chemokines, cytokines that are known to mediate immune cell recruitment and further tissue damage in the retina (Tan et al., 2020, pp. 4–5; Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 10–11). On a more detailed biochemical level, blocking IL-1R1 also allows for the stabilization of autophagic function in the RPE, which is essential for the clearance of cellular debris and for maintaining the health of photoreceptors. Preservation of autophagy and lysosomal activity in RPE cells directly supports the capacity for effective POS phagocytosis – a critical function compromised in AMD. Additionally, by mitigating IL-1 signaling, Anakinra may indirectly support normal cytoskeletal dynamics and integrin-mediated cell adhesion processes required for efficient phagocytosis via MerTK receptors located on the RPE (Korhonen, 2024, pp. 168–171).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing Anakinra in dry AMD posits that intravitreal or periocular administration of this IL-1 receptor antagonist will reduce the local retinal inflammation induced by NLRP3 inflammasome activation in RPE cells. Specifically, by preventing IL-1β from engaging its receptor, Anakinra is expected to reduce the secretion of downstream inflammatory mediators that exacerbate RPE cell stress and promote cell death through pyroptosis. As RPE cells are pivotal in maintaining the health of the retinal environment—by phagocytosing shed POS and by managing oxidative stress—the attenuation of chronic inflammation should help preserve cellular autophagic functions and lysosomal homeostasis. This preservation would, in turn, support the integrin/MerTK-mediated clearance of dysfunctional POS, thereby potentially slowing the progression of dry AMD. Preclinical evidence suggests that IL-1β levels are elevated in the vitreous and RPE of AMD patients, with inflammasome products correlating with disease severity (Tseng, 2014, pp. 90–94; Korhonen, 2024, pp. 84–86). Additional studies have shown that inhibiting IL-1 signaling in ocular experimental models leads to decreased choroidal neovascularization and preserved retinal structure (Campbell & Doyle, 2013, pp. 7–8; Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 2–3). In assays designed to evaluate retinal inflammatory status and phagocytic function of RPE cells, one would expect to observe reduced levels of IL-1β, decreased markers of inflammasome activation (e.g., caspase-1 cleavage), and normalized expression or activity of phagocytic receptors like MerTK. Furthermore, restoration of autophagy markers and cytoskeletal dynamics in the RPE would provide biochemical evidence of improved cellular homeostasis and function (Brandstetter, 2016, pp. 102–104; Korhonen, 2024, pp. 168–171). Given that Anakinra is a small protein molecule, its intraocular diffusion following local injection is expected to be sufficient to reach the RPE layer in therapeutic concentrations, thereby ensuring effective receptor blockade in the targeted tissue (Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 10–11; Tan et al., 2020, pp. 4–5).

Overall Evaluation:
The repurposing of Anakinra as a candidate for treating dry age-related macular degeneration is supported by several compelling lines of evidence. One significant strength is the robust molecular rationale: IL-1β produced via NLRP3 inflammasome activation in RPE cells has been demonstrated to initiate and perpetuate a chronic inflammatory state that undermines lysosomal and autophagic processes—and ultimately POS phagocytosis—in the retina. By selectively blocking IL-1 receptor signaling, Anakinra could break this inflammatory cycle, offering both neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. Preclinical studies in ocular disease models have shown that IL-1 blockade can reduce markers of inflammation and, in some models, decrease pathological neovascularization (Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 2–3; Campbell & Doyle, 2013, pp. 7–8). Moreover, the extensive clinical experience with Anakinra in systemic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, which has established a favorable safety profile, accelerates its potential repositioning for ocular indications (Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 1–2).

However, several weaknesses and challenges remain. To date, there is a paucity of direct clinical trial evidence supporting the use of Anakinra in dry AMD specifically; most of the available data pertain to its effects in other ocular inflammatory conditions such as uveitis or, in the context of CNV models, in neovascular AMD (Campbell & Doyle, 2013, pp. 7–8; Tseng, 2014, pp. 94–99). This gap indicates a key area where further preclinical and clinical studies are needed. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic profile of Anakinra poses challenges regarding its ability to maintain therapeutic concentrations in the posterior segment of the eye. Its relatively short half-life might require repeated intravitreal or periocular injections, which raises concerns about patient compliance and the cumulative risk of injection-related complications such as endophthalmitis. Although preclinical studies have reported safety following intravitreal administration, detailed pharmacodynamic and long-term safety evaluations specific to the ocular environment remain to be conducted (Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 10–11; Tseng, 2014, pp. 90–94).

Another potential limitation lies in the complexity of the inflammatory milieu within AMD. The pathogenesis of dry AMD is multifactorial, involving not only IL-1β but also other cytokines such as IL-18, complement activation products, and reactive oxygen species. While IL-1β blockade may alleviate one aspect of the pathological cascade, it does not address the entirety of the degenerative process. For instance, IL-18 has been implicated in both protective and detrimental roles in AMD, and its regulation is not directly affected by IL-1 receptor antagonism (Brandstetter, 2016, pp. 102–104; Korhonen, 2024, pp. 84–86). Thus, the therapeutic benefit of Anakinra might be limited if other inflammatory pathways continue to drive RPE degeneration despite IL-1 blockade.

In summary, the overall evaluation of Anakinra as a repurposed therapy for dry AMD is cautiously optimistic. The drug’s mechanism of action directly targets a key inflammatory cascade—that is, IL-1β signaling—that has been extensively implicated in RPE dysfunction and retinal degeneration. Its established safety profile in systemic use and preliminary supportive data in ocular models lend further credence to its potential. However, the translation of these findings to the treatment of dry AMD will require robust preclinical studies focusing on pharmacokinetics, efficacy in models that mimic the chronic degenerative nature of dry AMD, and eventually, well-designed clinical trials to assess both safety and therapeutic benefit in patients. The complex interplay of multiple inflammatory mediators in AMD also suggests that combination therapies or broader anti-inflammatory strategies may be needed in parallel to IL-1 blockade. Overall, while Anakinra presents as a promising candidate with considerable mechanistic rationale and supportive preclinical evidence, strategic further investigation is warranted to comprehensively determine its viability as a treatment for dry AMD (Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Tan et al., 2020, pp. 4–5; Tseng, 2014, pp. 94–99; Korhonen, 2024, pp. 168–171).

Below is our comprehensive evaluation report for Dapansutrile (OLT1177) as a repurposed candidate for treating dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD):

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dapansutrile is an orally bioavailable small‐molecule inhibitor that belongs to the class of beta‐sulfonyl nitrile compounds; it was originally discovered and developed by Olatec Therapeutics for its potent anti‐inflammatory properties. Its chemical structure and affinity for the NLRP3 inflammasome place it in a group of selective inhibitors that work by interfering with the ATPase activity of NLRP3, thereby preventing its oligomerization and subsequent activation. Being a synthetic compound, dapansutrile has been optimized for oral administration and systemic bioavailability, which is a key advantage over locally administered therapies. This class of therapeutic compounds has been previously applied in systemic inflammatory diseases, showing that targeting inflammasome pathways can translate into clinical efficacy in diseases such as gout, heart failure, and Schnitzler’s syndrome. Its development builds on a growing body of research that has demonstrated the central role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in mediating chronic sterile inflammation across different tissues (Singh, 2025; Tanase et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Dapansutrile’s therapeutic history is notable for its evaluation in several non‐ocular inflammatory disease settings. Early Phase I trials in healthy volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014) demonstrated that dapansutrile is safe and well‐tolerated when administered orally with predictable pharmacokinetics. Subsequently, clinical studies such as the Phase 2a proof‐of‐concept trial in acute gout flares (Jansen et al., 2019; Klück et al., 2020) have provided evidence that oral dosing of dapansutrile results in significant reductions in joint pain and inflammatory cytokine levels, particularly interleukin‐1β (IL-1β) and IL-6, with minimal adverse effects. Additionally, it has been studied in conditions such as Schnitzler’s syndrome (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018a) and heart failure (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018b), where its inhibitory effect on the NLRP3 inflammasome was central to its clinical activity. Although there is as yet no direct clinical trial data for dapansutrile in treating dry AMD or closely related ocular inflammatory conditions, the molecule’s clinical success in diverse inflammatory diseases provides a strong rationale for repurposing it for a condition characterized by chronic retinal inflammation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
Dapansutrile works by selectively inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome, an intracellular multiprotein complex that, when activated, converts pro-caspase-1 into active caspase-1. Caspase-1 then cleaves the inactive precursors of IL-1β and IL-18 into their mature, bioactive forms which are then secreted, driving a cascade of inflammatory responses. The compound achieves its effect by binding directly to the NLRP3 protein, interfering with its ATPase activity—a necessary step for the oligomerization of NLRP3 with the adaptor protein ASC, and the subsequent activation of caspase-1 (Singh, 2025; Tanase et al., 2023). By blocking this critical assembly step, dapansutrile effectively reduces the production of IL-1β and IL-18. Preclinical studies have shown that inhibition of NLRP3 activation leads to reduced inflammatory cytokine release in human monocytes and macrophages, and it does so selectively without affecting other inflammasomes (such as AIM2 or NLRC4), thereby decreasing the risk of off-target effects (Schwaid & Spencer, 2020; Mezzaroma et al., 2021). In the context of dry AMD, chronic activation of NLRP3 within retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells contributes to an inflammatory microenvironment that underlies the degeneration and dysfunction of these cells. Therefore, inhibiting NLRP3 represents a mechanistically targeted approach to reduce downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines and thereby mitigate RPE cell pyroptosis and preserve retinal homeostasis (Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Doyle et al., 2012).

Expected Effect:
Based on the underlying hypothesis, the expected effect of dapansutrile in dry AMD is fourfold. First, by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome, the drug is anticipated to suppress the maturation and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, cytokines critically involved in propagating a chronic inflammatory state within the retinal posterior segment. Second, the reduction in inflammatory cytokines should mitigate pyroptotic cell death in RPE cells, thereby preserving their viability and function. Third, by reducing chronic inflammation, dapansutrile is expected to indirectly restore autophagic processes and improve the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by the RPE. In vitro studies and animal models of AMD have demonstrated that dysregulated autophagy and impaired clearance of POS are key features of dry AMD, and that inflammation exacerbates these defects (Piippo, 2019; Wang et al., 2016). Fourth, as oral dosing of dapansutrile has been shown to produce systemic plasma levels capable of crossing the blood–retinal barrier (BRB), there is reasonable expectation that sufficient drug concentrations could reach the RPE layer, thereby exerting its anti-inflammatory effects locally (Anderson et al., 2023; Tengesdal et al., 2024). With RPE cells being a primary target in dry AMD pathology, the inhibition of inflammasome-driven cytokine production is thus anticipated to result in an overall reduction of retinal degeneration, potentially halting or even reversing the progression of geographic atrophy associated with dry AMD (Doyle et al., 2012; Campbell & Doyle, 2013).

Overall Evaluation:
Dapansutrile presents as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in dry AMD treatment, with several key strengths supporting its potential efficacy. Its oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile—demonstrated in multiple Phase I and II studies in other inflammatory conditions—provide a practical advantage for chronic systemic therapy, which is particularly valuable given the need for sustained treatment in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018b; Klück et al., 2020). Furthermore, its precise mechanism of action, targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome and thereby reducing IL-1β and IL-18 secretion, directly addresses a pathogenic axis implicated in the progression of dry AMD. This mechanistic rationale is strengthened by literature that documents upregulated NLRP3 activation in RPE cells under oxidative stress and inflammatory conditions – key factors in AMD pathology (Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Doyle et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2016). Moreover, by potentially restoring autophagy and normal phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments, dapansutrile may correct multiple facets of the degenerative process in dry AMD.

However, there are also noteworthy limitations that must be acknowledged. As of now, there are no published ocular-specific pharmacokinetic studies confirming that orally administered dapansutrile achieves therapeutic concentrations within the retinal tissues. Although systemic plasma levels suggest the possibility of BRB penetration, definitive data on retinal bioavailability are lacking (Tengesdal et al., 2024; Mezzaroma et al., 2021). Furthermore, while the preclinical evidence strongly supports the role of NLRP3 in AMD, direct preclinical models using dapansutrile in retinal settings or animal models of dry AMD have not been extensively reported in the current literature. Without such targeted studies, the translation of its anti-inflammatory efficacy from systemic inflammatory conditions to the unique microenvironment of the retina remains an assumption that must be validated. In addition, the intricate interplay between the protective and deleterious roles of inflammasome activation in AMD (for example, the dual roles of IL-18) requires careful balancing. An overly broad suppression of NLRP3 activation could potentially interfere with protective immune mechanisms within the eye (Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Doyle et al., 2012). Lastly, while the safety in systemic administration has been documented for conditions such as gout and heart failure, the long-term safety profile for chronic use in an elderly population with dry AMD, who may additionally have comorbidities, needs to be rigorously assessed (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018b; Klück et al., 2020).

In summary, dapansutrile’s strong preclinical and clinical background as a selective NLRP3 inhibitor, its oral delivery, and promising safety data in systemic inflammatory diseases make it a compelling candidate for repurposing in dry AMD. Its proposed mechanism—suppressing inflammasome activation in the RPE, reducing IL-1β/IL-18 secretion, mitigating RPE pyroptosis, and indirectly restoring critical autophagic and phagocytic functions—addresses several key pathogenic mechanisms implicated in AMD. However, before advancing in clinical development for dry AMD, targeted investigations are required to confirm retinal penetration, efficacy in ocular inflammatory models, and the optimal dosing strategy to achieve a balance between reducing harmful inflammation while preserving necessary immune functions.

Overall, we conclude that dapansutrile represents an innovative, mechanism-based approach to treating dry AMD, and with further focused ocular studies, it holds the potential to fill a significant therapeutic gap in a patient population with limited current treatment options (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Doyle et al., 2012; Tanase et al., 2023; Tengesdal et al., 2024).

Recombinant human Gas6 (R&D Systems Cat# 885-GS-050),"Proposal for Recombinant human Gas6 (R&D Systems Cat# 885-GS-050)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Recombinant human Gas6 is a biologically derived protein produced via recombinant expression systems – typically in mammalian cells – to generate a protein that is structurally and functionally identical to its native counterpart. Gas6, also known as growth arrest‐specific gene 6, belongs to the vitamin K‐dependent protein family and features an N‐terminal Gla domain that is critical for binding to phosphatidylserine on apoptotic or activated cell surfaces (Wu et al., 2017, pp. 2–3). As a recombinant therapeutic, it is classified as a biologic protein therapeutic and is supplied by vendors such as R&D Systems (Cat# 885-GS-050). This class of therapeutic compounds has been used extensively in research to study receptor–ligand interactions, particularly in the context of the TAM receptor family (Tyro3, Axl, and MerTK), where endogenous Gas6 functions as a high-affinity ligand. These proteins have been used in various experimental systems to elucidate signaling functions including immune regulation, cell survival, and phagocytosis (Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012, pp. 1–2).

Therapeutic History:
Gas6 and its interaction with TAM receptors have been studied in multiple preclinical settings, predominantly in biochemical and genetic investigations. Genetic studies in mice have demonstrated that deletion of Gas6 – particularly in combination with Protein S deficiency – recapitulates the defective phagocytosis phenotypes observed with MerTK mutations, underscoring its importance in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) function (Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012, pp. 14–17). Preclinical studies in retinal models have shown that Gas6 enhances phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by RPE cells, a process that is crucial for retinal homeostasis (Inana et al., 2018, pp. 11–12). Although recombinant Gas6 protein itself has been more thoroughly evaluated in in vitro and small animal models – with data demonstrating enhanced phagocytosis under stress conditions – there is as yet limited clinical trial or veterinary data using Gas6 for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, additional clinical research into the modulation of Gas6/TAM signaling exists in oncology – for example, an ovarian cancer trial focused on targeting Gas6 binding to its receptor Axl (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021) – which indirectly validates the importance of Gas6 in modulating receptor-mediated signaling. Thus, while Gas6 has not been directly repurposed in clinical studies for AMD, the extensive body of preclinical and genetic evidence supporting its role in RPE phagocytosis forms a strong rationale for its consideration as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD (Ochoa et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
The proposed mechanism of action for recombinant human Gas6 in dry AMD is rooted in its capacity to bind and activate MerTK on the apical surface of RPE cells. MerTK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays an essential role in mediating the daily phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. Activation of MerTK by its ligand Gas6 triggers downstream signaling cascades that include focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the small GTPase Rac1, both of which are critical regulators of cytoskeletal reorganization (Strick & Vollrath, 2010, pp. 1–2). Upon binding of Gas6 to MerTK, receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation occur, leading to the recruitment of intracellular adaptor proteins and the subsequent activation of FAK. This kinase activation initiates a cascade resulting in Rac1-mediated reorganization of actin filaments, thereby facilitating the extension of pseudopodia and engulfment of POS debris (Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012, pp. 14–17). Biochemical studies have detailed how Gas6, through its vitamin K-dependent Gla domain, bridges phosphatidylserine on apoptotic POS to MerTK, essentially “tagging” the debris for phagocytosis (Wu et al., 2017, pp. 2–3). In addition, in vitro data in stressed induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE (iPSC-RPE) have demonstrated that treatment with recombinant Gas6 can boost POS ingestion by approximately two-fold, which supports the hypothesis that exogenous Gas6 can overcome the phagocytic deficits common under oxidative conditions found in dry AMD (Albert et al., 2015, pp. 1–2). Moreover, expression data confirm that MerTK is robustly expressed in RPE cells, establishing the requisite cellular context for Gas6 action (Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012, pp. 1–2).

Expected Effect:
The expected effect of recombinant human Gas6 in the proposed dry AMD model is a restoration of deficient RPE phagocytic activity. Under oxidative stress conditions – which are characteristic of the aged retina in dry AMD – RPE phagocytosis is compromised, leading to an accumulation of photoreceptor debris, lipofuscin, and other toxic metabolic byproducts. Exogenously administered Gas6 is anticipated to bind to MerTK on the RPE surface, thereby activating the downstream FAK/Rac1 signaling cascade that reorganizes the cytoskeleton, enhances the formation of phagocytic cups, and promotes the internalization of POS (Wu et al., 2021, pp. 7–10). In vitro studies with stressed iPSC-RPE cells have shown that recombinant Gas6 boosts POS uptake by about two-fold, suggesting that, when delivered via periocular injection to ensure sufficient retinal exposure, recombinant Gas6 can ameliorate the phagocytic deficits that contribute to debris accumulation in dry AMD (Wu et al., 2021, pp. 2–7). The increased phagocytosis is expected to alleviate the chronic oxidative stress and inflammation that drive RPE dysfunction and photoreceptor death, potentially translating to stabilization of retinal structure and improved visual outcomes (Inana et al., 2018, p. 15).

Overall Evaluation:
Recombinant human Gas6 presents as a promising candidate for the treatment of dry AMD based on a strong mechanistic framework and extensive preclinical validation of its role in RPE phagocytosis. One major strength of Gas6 as a therapeutic is that it directly targets MerTK, a receptor with well-documented genetic validation in retinal dystrophies – evidenced by the fact that MerTK loss-of-function in RCS rats results in severe impairment of POS clearance (Strick & Vollrath, 2010, pp. 1–2; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012, pp. 14–17). This receptor-ligand interaction is highly specific, offering a mechanistic advantage over more generalized anti-inflammatory or neuroprotective strategies. Additionally, in vitro studies have demonstrated that recombinant Gas6 can double the phagocytic uptake of stressed RPE cells, which is highly encouraging given the central role of impaired phagocytosis in dry AMD pathology (Albert et al., 2015, pp. 1–2; Wu et al., 2021, pp. 2–7).

Another strength lies in the potential delivery strategy: periocular injections have been previously explored for other recombinant proteins targeting the retina, suggesting that achieving therapeutically relevant retinal levels of Gas6 is feasible (Wu et al., 2021, pp. 10–12). The specificity of Gas6 also means that, if appropriately dosed, it is likely to have fewer off-target effects, although caution is warranted given its known pro-angiogenic effects in other ocular cell types (Kim et al., 2014, pp. 8–10). Such effects could be problematic in wet AMD settings; however, in the context of dry AMD – where neovascularization is not a primary concern – these pro-angiogenic properties may be less problematic or may require careful modulation of dosing and timing.

Despite the promising attributes, there are some weaknesses that merit further investigation. First, while preclinical data supporting the role of Gas6 in enhancing RPE phagocytosis are robust, there is a significant gap in clinical data regarding its safety, tolerability, and efficacy in patients with dry AMD. Most of the current evidence comes from in vitro experiments and animal models, and extrapolation to human disease will require carefully designed clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022). Second, as a recombinant protein, Gas6 may have a relatively short half-life in vivo and could require sustained delivery formulations – as has been attempted with nanoparticle encapsulation in preclinical models – to achieve continuous receptor activation (Wu et al., 2021, pp. 13–14). This introduces potential challenges related to formulation, dosing frequency, and cost of goods. Additionally, while Gas6 preferentially activates MerTK, it also binds to other TAM receptors such as Axl and Tyro3, which may lead to off-target effects that are not yet fully characterized in the retinal microenvironment (Lahey et al., 2022, pp. 3–4).

In summary, recombinant human Gas6 is a strong candidate for addressing a fundamental defect in dry AMD – the impaired phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments due to compromised MerTK signaling. The molecular rationale is well supported by genetic and biochemical data showing that Gas6 is a high-affinity ligand for MerTK and that its engagement initiates FAK/Rac1-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling to promote phagocytosis (Strick & Vollrath, 2010, pp. 1–2; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012, pp. 14–17; Wu et al., 2017, pp. 2–3). The expected benefits include a restoration of normal RPE function, reduction in debris accumulation, and potential stabilization of the degenerative process in dry AMD (Inana et al., 2018, pp. 11–12; Wu et al., 2021, pp. 7–10). However, the translational pathway will require addressing the challenges of rapid protein clearance, ensuring targeted retinal exposure via appropriate delivery methods, and minimizing possible off-target effects related to the pleiotropic actions of Gas6 (Ochoa et al., 2023; Lahey et al., 2022, pp. 1–3; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012, pp. 1–2).

Trehalose (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# T9531),"Proposal for Trehalose (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# T9531)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Trehalose is a naturally occurring, non‐reducing disaccharide composed of two glucose molecules, originally discovered in various natural sources such as fungi, plants, and invertebrates. It is produced biotechnologically by the trehalose synthase pathway and has been commonly used as a biochemical stabilizer due to its ability to protect proteins and cellular membranes under stress conditions (Laihia & Kaarniranta, 2020, pp. 20–21). As a sugar-based molecule, trehalose falls under the class of natural osmolytes and chemical chaperones that have been widely exploited in both biomedical and industrial settings. This class of compounds is known for its capacity to stabilize protein conformations, prevent aggregation, and modulate cellular stress responses. Historically, trehalose gained attention in fields such as cryopreservation, formulation of therapeutic proteins, and maintenance of ocular surface homeostasis, thereby establishing its role as a cytoprotective agent with a strong safety profile (Abokyi et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; Laihia & Kaarniranta, 2020, pp. 20–21).

Therapeutic History:
Trehalose’s utility has been documented extensively in biochemical and clinical literature. It is approved by regulatory agencies such as the US FDA and European regulatory bodies as a safe food additive and has been used in various clinical, topical, and veterinary applications. For instance, trehalose has been utilized in treating ocular conditions such as dry eye syndrome and in the postsurgical management of corneal procedures, where its osmoprotectant and protein-stabilizing properties are exploited (Laihia & Kaarniranta, 2020, pp. 20–21). In clinical settings, trehalose has been administered intravenously at high doses for neuromuscular disorders, and its extensive safety record bolsters its candidacy for repurposing in other diseases. While there is no extensive clinical trial data directly associating trehalose administration with the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD), several preclinical studies have explored its role in enhancing autophagic flux and lysosomal activity. In retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cellular models, trehalose has been shown to reduce the accumulation of toxic aggregates such as p62 and A2E, two key markers associated with dry AMD pathology (Abokyi et al., 2020, pp. 16–17). Furthermore, trehalose has been employed in various preclinical paradigms to counter oxidative damage, suggesting its potential for mitigating the cellular dysfunctions that underpin dry AMD (Abokyi, 2021, pp. 13–15; Abokyi, 2021, pp. 27–32).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, trehalose functions primarily as an inducer of autophagy by promoting the nuclear translocation and activation of the transcription factor EB (TFEB). TFEB is recognized as a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy gene expression—it controls the CLEAR (Coordinated Lysosomal Expression and Regulation) network, which drives the expression of key lysosomal and autophagy‐related genes. The activation of TFEB by trehalose enhances autophagic flux, which is the process by which cells remove damaged proteins and organelles. In multiple RPE cell assays (including those using ARPE‐19 cells), treatment with trehalose has been shown to induce increased expression of autophagy markers such as LC3B, ATG5, ATG7, and LAMP2, as well as to promote the clearance of p62 aggregates (Abokyi et al., 2020, pp. 11–12, 16–17). The molecular interactions involve trehalose’s ability to bypass mTOR inhibition pathways—thus achieving TFEB activation in an mTOR-independent manner—which avoids many of the side effects typically associated with mTOR inhibitors (Ghosh et al., 2024, pp. 10–11). Furthermore, trehalose has been shown to mitigate oxidative stress by restoring the function of the NRF2 antioxidant pathway, even when NRF2 is impaired by external stressors such as hydroquinone (HQ) that simulate cigarette smoke exposure (Abokyi et al., 2020, pp. 12–13). This dual action—activating both autophagy via TFEB and supporting the antioxidant response—suggests that trehalose can counter not only the intracellular accumulation of toxic substances like lipofuscin and undigested photoreceptor outer segments (POS) but also reduce oxidative damage within RPE cells (Abokyi, 2021, pp. 160–165). Additionally, there is emerging evidence that trehalose may positively influence mitochondrial bioenergetics, helping to restore mitochondrial membrane potential and, thereby, improve cellular energy metabolism, which is crucial given the high-energy demands of RPE cells (Ebeling et al., 2022, pp. 15–17). Moreover, by enhancing autophagic clearance, trehalose is thought to indirectly support the function of Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK), which is critical for the phagocytosis of POS by RPE cells—a process that is typically compromised in dry AMD (Ghosh et al., 2024, pp. 6–8).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesized mechanism, trehalose is expected to exert multifaceted beneficial effects in the context of dry AMD. In vitro assays using RPE cells (e.g., the ARPE-19 cell line) have demonstrated that trehalose treatment results in the nuclear translocation of TFEB and the resultant upregulation of lysosomal and autophagy genes (Abokyi et al., 2020, pp. 11–12, 16–17). This action is directly anticipated to enhance autophagic degradation, thereby reducing the accumulation of lipofuscin—an autofluorescent pigment that accumulates as a result of incomplete digestion of POS and is a key contributor to RPE dysfunction in dry AMD (Abokyi, 2021, pp. 165–170). In parallel, trehalose’s promotion of autophagy is expected to bolster mitochondrial quality control by facilitating the clearance of damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) and restoring mitochondrial function, as evidenced by improved mitochondrial membrane potential and bioenergetic profiles in treated cells (Ebeling et al., 2022, pp. 15–17). This restoration of mitochondrial function is critical for RPE cells, which rely heavily on efficient mitochondrial energy production to sustain the phagocytosis of POS and overall retinal homeostasis.

The compound is also anticipated to improve MerTK-mediated phagocytosis in RPE cells—the receptor process by which RPE cells ingest shed POS—which is essential for retinal health. Activation of TFEB by trehalose enhances lysosomal biogenesis and the overall degradative capacity of the cell, which in turn is hypothesized to improve the efficiency of MerTK-dependent phagocytosis (Ghosh et al., 2024, pp. 6–8). Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that trehalose treatment results in the reduction of cytotoxic aggregates like p62 and the restoration of cellular proteostasis, factors that are crucial in mitigating cell death induced by chronic oxidative stress (Abokyi et al., 2020, pp. 13–15). The expected effect, therefore, is that trehalose will lead to a net reduction in lipofuscin accumulation, improved clearance of undigested POS, better mitochondrial function, and eventually enhanced phagocytic activity of RPE cells—all of which are beneficial for delaying or reversing the progression of dry AMD (Abokyi, 2021, pp. 27–32; Abokyi, 2025, pp. 7–8).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, trehalose presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of dry AMD based on its well-documented properties as an autophagy enhancer and lysosomal activator. One of the greatest strengths of trehalose is its dual mechanism of action: it not only activates TFEB—thereby enhancing the autophagy-lysosomal pathway necessary for the clearance of toxic aggregates such as lipofuscin—but also supports mitochondrial function and promotes cellular antioxidant defenses via NRF2 pathways. The fact that trehalose operates in an mTOR-independent manner to activate TFEB circumvents many of the adverse effects typically seen with mTOR inhibitors, offering a safer profile for long-term administration (Ghosh et al., 2024, pp. 10–11). Additionally, its natural, sugar-based structure contributes to a low toxicity profile and favorable pharmacokinetics, and previous uses in ocular formulations and systemic applications provide a strong foundation for its repurposing in dry AMD (Laihia & Kaarniranta, 2020, pp. 20–21).

Furthermore, the ability of trehalose to restore autophagic flux in RPE cells is supported by multiple independent studies, which have demonstrated reduced p62 accumulation, improved lysosomal enzyme function, and enhanced clearance of oxidative debris in preclinical models (Abokyi et al., 2020, pp. 16–17; Abokyi, 2021, pp. 160–165). These effects are particularly relevant in the context of dry AMD, a disease characterized by RPE dysfunction, lipofuscin build-up, and impaired phagocytic clearance of POS. Additionally, the improvement in mitochondrial function observed upon trehalose treatment is a significant advantage because mitochondrial decline is a well-known contributor to RPE degeneration and retinal dysfunction (Ebeling et al., 2022, pp. 15–17).

On the other hand, there are some challenges and weaknesses that must be noted. While the preclinical evidence is compelling, clinical trial data evaluating trehalose specifically in dry AMD patients remain limited, necessitating further translational and clinical research to confirm its efficacy in human subjects. Ocular bioavailability, particularly regarding the optimal route of administration (oral versus intravitreal), remains an area that requires more robust investigation to ensure that sufficient trehalose concentrations can be achieved in the retinal tissue without off-target effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, while trehalose’s ability to modulate autophagy is well established, the precise dose-response relationship must be carefully elucidated since higher doses of trehalose have been shown, in some studies, to lead to overactivation of autophagy and even apoptotic cell death in RPE cells (Abokyi et al., 2020, pp. 15–16). This indicates that precise dosing and careful monitoring of autophagic flux will be critical parameters in any future clinical trial.

Moreover, additional mechanistic details need to be addressed, such as confirming trehalose’s effects on MerTK-mediated phagocytosis, which is important for POS clearance, and clarifying its direct impact on lipofuscin degradation and mitochondrial biogenesis beyond improving mitochondrial function. Although current data suggest improvements in these pathways, direct assays demonstrating these outcomes in vivo or in more advanced clinical models are still sparse (Ghosh et al., 2024, pp. 6–8; Abokyi, 2021, pp. 165–170). There is also the challenge of ensuring that the beneficial effects observed in in vitro assays of ARPE-19 cells and preclinical animal models will translate into clinical efficacy in humans, given the complex pathophysiology of dry AMD.

In conclusion, trehalose stands out as a strong candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic for dry AMD due to its ability to activate TFEB and thereby enhance autophagic flux, lysosomal biogenesis, and mitochondrial function. Its ability to facilitate the degradation of lipofuscin and undigested POS, coupled with a favorable safety profile owing to its natural origin and prior use in both clinical and veterinary settings, makes it a particularly attractive intervention (Abokyi, 2025, pp. 7–8; Ghosh et al., 2024, p. 6). Although some limitations exist—namely, the need for further clinical validation and optimization of dosing regimens—trehalose’s robust mechanism of action and preclinical efficacy data warrant its further evaluation in clinical trials targeting dry AMD. Given the substantial unmet therapeutic need in dry AMD and the strong mechanistic underpinnings presented by trehalose’s modulation of the autophagy–lysosome axis, the candidate merits further investigation and development with a focus on precisely defining the dosing, delivery route, and direct clinical outcomes in retinal function improvement (Abokyi, 2021, pp. 27–32; Ebeling et al., 2022, pp. 15–17).

Overall, the strengths of trehalose for dry AMD include its well-documented activation of TFEB leading to enhanced autophagy and lysosomal activity, its potential to restore mitochondrial function and support cellular antioxidant defenses, and its demonstrated safety profile from multiple clinical and veterinary applications. The primary weaknesses are the current lack of direct clinical evidence in dry AMD, the need for optimized dosing to avoid potential overactivation of autophagy, and uncertainties regarding achieving sufficient ocular bioavailability. Addressing these weaknesses through rigorous translational studies and carefully designed clinical trials will be crucial in determining trehalose’s viability as a novel therapeutic intervention for dry AMD.

MitoQ (mitoquinone),"Proposal for MitoQ (mitoquinone)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MitoQ (mitoquinone) is a synthetic mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant that was developed by chemically conjugating a ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) antioxidant moiety to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) cation via an aliphatic linker. This design exploits the large negative membrane potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane to drive selective accumulation of the compound into mitochondria, where its ubiquinone group can undergo reduction to its active antioxidant form — mitoquinol — and function in situ to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). MitoQ belongs to the class of mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants, a family of compounds that includes other molecules such as SkQ1, MitoPBN and MitoVitE. These compounds have been synthesized and evaluated extensively to overcome the limitations of conventional antioxidants, whose lack of cellular and subcellular specificity often limits their efficacy in diseases where oxidative stress is compartmentalized, such as in mitochondrial dysfunction. Research has demonstrated that such TPP⁺-conjugated antioxidants can concentrate several hundred-fold within mitochondria, ensuring high local antioxidant capacity and better mitigation of oxidative insults. The synthetic strategy and molecular design of MitoQ capitalizes on the natural properties of ubiquinone in the electron transport chain, but through chemical modification it has been endowed with enhanced mitochondrial uptake and improved pharmacokinetic profiles — factors that support its potential repurposing for diseases like dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) where mitochondrial oxidative stress in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells is considered a key pathological driver (Murphy & Hartley, 2018; Apostolova & Victor, 2015).

Therapeutic History:
MitoQ has been investigated in a variety of biochemical and preclinical contexts due to its ability to attenuate mitochondrial oxidative damage. Its development initially targeted conditions characterized by excessive mitochondrial ROS such as neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases), cardiovascular dysfunction, and metabolic syndromes. Preclinical studies have reported safety and efficacy in models of ischemia-reperfusion injury, where MitoQ reduced tissue damage through its ROS-scavenging properties and improved mitochondrial function. Additionally, MitoQ has been evaluated in clinical trials for conditions such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and vascular dysfunction, where its ability to improve endothelial function and reduce oxidative biomarkers has been established (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Bubb et al., 2020). Although there are no registered clinical trials specifically targeting dry AMD or retinal degeneration (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), preclinical studies and biochemical evidence demonstrate that mitochondrial oxidative stress plays a central role in retinal diseases. For instance, research in animal models of AMD has shown that accumulation of ROS in RPE cells can lead to lysosomal dysfunction, compromise autophagy, and contribute to the build-up of undigested photoreceptor outer segments (POS) (Han, 2018; Jarrett & Boulton, 2012). Given the therapeutic history and broad evaluation of MitoQ in oxidative stress–related pathologies, repurposing it for dry AMD is scientifically plausible, especially as its mechanism has been extensively validated in other conditions characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Murphy & Hartley, 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, MitoQ functions primarily as a redox-active antioxidant localized to mitochondria. The TPP⁺ moiety facilitates the compound’s passage through lipid bilayers and its accumulation into the mitochondrial matrix driven by the negative membrane potential of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fields et al., 2023). Once inside the mitochondria, MitoQ is reduced by components of the electron transport chain—predominantly by complex II, or succinate dehydrogenase—to its active form, mitoquinol. This reduced form is capable of neutralizing reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anion (O₂•⁻), peroxyl radicals, and peroxynitrite by donating an electron, thereby interrupting lipid peroxidation chain reactions that would otherwise damage mitochondrial membranes, proteins, and mitochondrial DNA (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Murphy & Hartley, 2018). When the antioxidant activity is exerted, mitoquinol is re-oxidized back to mitoquinone and can be continuously recycled within the mitochondria. This rechargeable cycle permits prolonged reduction in mitochondrial oxidative stress without significantly interfering with normal electron transport, since MitoQ is a poor substrate for complexes I and III and does not act as a primary electron carrier (Hirzel, 2013; Lukashev et al., 2014). In preclinical ARPE-19 cell models exposed to oxidative stress, MitoQ has been shown to reduce mitochondrial ROS levels by about 60% at a concentration of 500 nM. This reduction in ROS is critical not only for protecting mitochondrial integrity but also for preventing the oxidative inhibition of lysosomal enzymes that can lead to impaired autophagy and a subsequent accumulation of undigested photoreceptor outer segments—a pathological cascade implicated in dry AMD (Jarrett & Boulton, 2012; Kim et al., 2021). In effect, by preserving the oxidative balance within RPE mitochondria, MitoQ may indirectly normalize lysosomal pH and restore effective autophagic clearance, which is essential in maintaining retinal homeostasis (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Fields et al., 2023).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underpinning the repurposing of MitoQ for dry AMD is that by selectively accumulating in RPE mitochondria and reducing mitochondrial-derived ROS, MitoQ will alleviate the oxidative stress that disrupts lysosomal enzyme function. In dry AMD, the RPE is responsible for phagocytosing and degrading shed POS, a process that is compromised by oxidative damage leading to the accumulation of lipofuscin and other toxic by-products. By normalizing mitochondrial redox state, MitoQ is expected to prevent the oxidative inhibition of lysosomal hydrolases, thereby restoring lysosomal pH and improving autophagic flux. This, in turn, should enhance the clearance of accumulated POS and reduce the cellular stress that leads to progressive RPE dysfunction and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration (Han, 2018; Nita & Grzybowski, 2023). Experimental data in ARPE-19 cells have shown that treatment with 500 nM MitoQ decreases mitochondrial ROS by approximately 60%, increases the intensity of the LysoTracker Red signal—which indicates normalized lysosomal pH—and improves FITC-labeled POS uptake by about 33%, which suggests enhanced phagocytic and autophagic activity. These findings imply that MitoQ, through its mitochondrial antioxidant action, could potentially reverse one of the critical pathological features observed in dry AMD: impaired autophagy and lysosomal degradation in the RPE (Ji et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021). Furthermore, preclinical studies in rabbits have confirmed that MitoQ can accumulate in retinal tissues and demonstrate a favorable safety profile, lending further support to its development as an ocular therapeutic (Macdonald et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on the comprehensive literature review detailed above, MitoQ emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration. One of the key strengths of MitoQ lies in its well-defined mechanism of action. As a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, it addresses the critical role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in RPE dysfunction, a fundamental pathological factor in dry AMD (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Jarrett & Boulton, 2012). The molecular design that couples ubiquinone with a TPP⁺ cation ensures that MitoQ selectively accumulates in mitochondria, effectively scavenging ROS in situ, which is a significant advantage over conventional, non-targeted antioxidants that lack such specificity (Fields et al., 2023; Zielonka et al., 2017).

From a therapeutic history standpoint, although there are no direct clinical trials for dry AMD that have utilized MitoQ (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), MitoQ’s efficacy in other diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress—such as cardiovascular diseases, liver dysfunction, and neurodegenerative disorders—provides a strong rationale for its further evaluation in retinal diseases (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Bubb et al., 2020). Preclinical evidence in cultured ARPE-19 cells, where MitoQ improved markers of mitochondrial and lysosomal function, reinforces the expectations that improved mitochondrial redox balance can restore autophagic processes essential for POS clearance in the RPE (Ji et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021).

Mechanistically, MitoQ has been shown to participate in a rechargeable antioxidant cycle within mitochondria and to significantly reduce oxidative stress without interfering with normal electron transport, thereby preserving mitochondrial integrity and function. This characteristic is particularly relevant given that unchecked ROS production in RPE cells not only leads to the impairment of lysosomal enzymes but also disrupts autophagy, thereby contributing to the progression of dry AMD (Jarrett & Boulton, 2012; Murphy & Hartley, 2018). The expected effect of MitoQ—increased clearance of damaged POS via normalized lysosomal function—aligns well with the concept that restoring cellular homeostasis in the RPE can mitigate the progression of AMD. The reported improvements in lysosomal pH (as evidenced by increased LysoTracker Red signals) and enhanced phagocytosis in ARPE-19 cells are particularly encouraging, highlighting a functional rescue of a key defect in dry AMD (Ji et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021).

Nonetheless, there are certain weaknesses to consider. Although the preclinical data in ARPE-19 cells and animal models are promising, the translation of these findings to human patients remains uncertain. There are inherent differences between cultured cell models and the complex in vivo environment of the human retina. Moreover, while MitoQ has been shown to be safe and to accumulate in retinal tissues in animal studies, the ocular bioavailability in humans and the efficiency of topical or systemic delivery to the RPE in AMD patients require further investigation (Macdonald et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, given that clinical trials in other conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, have sometimes failed to demonstrate significant benefits despite promising preclinical efficacy, the design of future AMD-specific clinical trials should incorporate appropriate biomarkers for mitochondrial function, lysosomal activity, and autophagic flux in the RPE (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Ji et al., 2021).

Overall, MitoQ’s strengths include its well-established mechanism as a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, its demonstrated ability to reduce mitochondrial ROS and restore lysosomal and autophagic function in preclinical models, and its favorable safety profile in other disease contexts. Its weaknesses pertain primarily to the current lack of direct clinical evidence in dry AMD, the challenge of translating cellular and animal data to the human ocular setting, and the need for optimized drug delivery systems to maximize retinal bioavailability. In sum, based on the current literature, MitoQ represents a well-rationalized and promising therapeutic candidate for further investigation as a treatment for dry AMD. It warrants additional preclinical studies in retinal-specific models and carefully designed clinical trials that focus on mitochondrial function and autophagy in the RPE (Jarrett & Boulton, 2012; Ji et al., 2021; Murphy & Hartley, 2018).

Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me; Reata Pharmaceuticals),"Proposal for Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me; Reata Pharmaceuticals)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Bardoxolone methyl (also known as CDDO‐Me or RTA‐402) is a synthetic oleanane triterpenoid derived from the naturally occurring oleanolic acid. It was designed by medicinal chemists to improve upon the pharmacokinetic properties and biological potency of its natural precursor. As a member of the synthetic triterpenoid class, Bardoxolone methyl was intentionally optimized to possess superior electrophilic properties that enable it to specifically interact with critical cysteine residues on regulatory proteins such as KEAP1. This class of compounds is well known for its robust ability to activate the Nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway and has been studied extensively for its antioxidative, anti‐inflammatory, and cytoprotective activities. Historically, compounds in this class have been investigated in diverse chronic diseases ranging from cancer to chronic kidney disease because of their capacity to modulate redox homeostasis and inflammatory responses (Cheng et al., 2021; Handa, 2012).

Therapeutic History:
Bardoxolone methyl has an extensive history in biochemical and clinical studies. It has been evaluated in multiple clinical trials, particularly for chronic kidney disease and diabetic nephropathy, and in oncology settings due to its ability to modulate oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling. Phase I and II clinical trials have demonstrated that Bardoxolone methyl is orally bioavailable, can achieve therapeutically relevant plasma concentrations, and effectively activates NRF2 target genes such as HO-1 and NQO1 in various tissues (Zhang, 2013; To et al., 2015). Although its direct investigation in ocular diseases or dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has been less prominent, related preclinical studies have evaluated its effects in retinal cells. For instance, in ARPE-19 cells—an established human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell line—Bardoxolone methyl has been shown to robustly induce Nrf2-dependent genes under oxidative stress conditions, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokine secretion (Cheng et al., 2021; Handa, 2012). Furthermore, clinical trial database searches indicate significant research interest in Bardoxolone methyl in the context of AMD and geographic atrophy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), suggesting that while dedicated retinal trials might be limited, there is translational potential given its systemic pharmacological profile.

Mechanism of Action:
Bardoxolone methyl exerts its principal mechanism of action through direct modulation of the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway. Under normal conditions, NRF2, a redox-sensitive transcription factor, is sequestered in the cytoplasm by KEAP1, which directs its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Bardoxolone methyl contains reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups that enable it to form reversible Michael adducts with specific cysteine residues (such as Cys151) on KEAP1. This covalent modification disrupts the KEAP1-NRF2 interaction, thereby preventing NRF2’s degradation. The liberated NRF2 then translocates into the nucleus where it dimerizes with small Maf proteins and binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of a wide array of genes. As a result, transcription of critical phase II detoxification and antioxidant genes—including NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) and modulatory subunits (GCLM)—is robustly induced (Mathis & Cui, 2016; Zhou et al., 2014). In addition, Bardoxolone methyl has been reported to modulate other signaling pathways such as NF-κB, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory effects by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production including IL-1β. This dual mechanism, involving both enhanced antioxidant capacity and suppression of innate inflammatory responses, is critically important in tissues such as the retinal pigment epithelium, where chronic oxidative stress and inflammation underpin pathogenesis (Handa, 2012; Nakagami, 2016).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing Bardoxolone methyl in dry age-related macular degeneration is that its activation of NRF2 will restore redox homeostasis in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, preserve lysosomal function, and enhance the process of photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagocytosis. Specifically, by binding to KEAP1 and releasing NRF2, Bardoxolone methyl is expected to upregulate antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1 and NQO1. These enzymes play crucial roles in detoxifying reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing oxidative damage within RPE cells. Experimental data have demonstrated that in ARPE-19 cells, Bardoxolone methyl robustly increases the expression of NRF2 targets under oxidative stress conditions, leading to a reduction in ROS, decreased accumulation of lipofuscin-like deposits, and diminished secretion of inflammatory mediators like IL-1β (Cheng et al., 2021; To et al., 2015). Given that impaired phagocytosis of POS by RPE cells is a key feature in the pathology of dry AMD, boosting innate cellular defenses via NRF2 activation is anticipated to enhance phagocytic efficiency and maintain retinal health. Moreover, by mitigating complement activation and the downstream NLRP3 inflammasome, Bardoxolone methyl could directly counteract the inflammatory cascade that contributes to RPE dysfunction in dry AMD (Handa, 2012; Cheng et al., 2021). Collectively, these antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective effects are expected to preserve RPE cell function, ultimately slowing or halting the progression of dry AMD.

Overall Evaluation:
Bardoxolone methyl presents a scientifically compelling candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration based on its well-characterized mechanism of action, preclinical efficacy, and clinical history in other oxidative stress-related diseases. One significant strength of this compound is its direct mechanism of KEAP1 inhibition leading to robust activation of NRF2 and subsequent upregulation of a broad spectrum of antioxidant and phase II detoxification enzymes. This targeted activation provides mechanistic specificity that is superior to general antioxidant supplements, which often suffer from low potency and limited bioavailability (Zhang, 2013; Zhou et al., 2014). Furthermore, the fact that Bardoxolone methyl has advanced into clinical trials for indications such as chronic kidney disease and cancer demonstrates that its pharmacokinetics, oral bioavailability, and safety profile have been sufficiently evaluated to warrant further repurposing efforts (To et al., 2015; Hybertson et al., 2014).

However, there are challenges that must be carefully considered. One notable weakness in repurposing Bardoxolone methyl for dry AMD is the lack of direct clinical evidence in retinal applications. While preclinical data in ARPE-19 cells are promising, the translation of these findings into clinical efficacy in AMD patients must be validated through targeted retinal studies and appropriately designed clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cheng et al., 2021). Additionally, previous clinical trials in non-ocular settings have identified safety concerns—most notably, cardiovascular adverse events in patients with chronic kidney disease—suggesting that the systemic effects of Bardoxolone methyl and its off-target interactions require further refinement and careful monitoring (Hybertson et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2020). Given that the eye is a sensitive organ, alternative delivery methods (e.g., localized intraocular administration or topical formulations) might be needed to limit systemic exposure and potential side effects while ensuring efficacious retinal concentrations.

Another potential challenge is ensuring that the compound not only activates NRF2 but does so in a manner that effectively restores lysosomal function and enhances POS phagocytosis in RPE cells. Although the hypothesis is strongly supported by the known biology of NRF2 and evidence from ARPE-19 cell studies, comprehensive in vivo studies in animal models of dry AMD are necessary to confirm these multifaceted effects. Moreover, the chronic nature of dry AMD implies that any therapeutic intervention must maintain sustainable NRF2 activation without triggering compensatory mechanisms that might attenuate the benefit or increase reductive stress – a phenomenon that can itself be detrimental (Mathis & Cui, 2016; Nakagami, 2016).

Despite these reservations, the overall strengths of Bardoxolone methyl—its potent NRF2 activation, documented effects on reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, and its existing clinical data in other indications—make it a promising candidate for further investigation in dry AMD. The mechanism by which Bardoxolone methyl acts is particularly attractive because it offers a means to address not only oxidative stress but also the inflammatory cascades associated with complement activation and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling, which are critical in the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Handa, 2012; Cheng et al., 2021).

In summary, Bardoxolone methyl, as a synthetic triterpenoid with direct KEAP1 binding and robust NRF2 activation, offers a strong biochemical rationale for use in dry AMD treatments. The expected effects—namely, enhancement of antioxidant defenses, reduction of ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokines, preservation of lysosomal function, and improvement in RPE cell phagocytic capacity—address several key pathological mechanisms underlying dry AMD. While further preclinical studies specifically focused on retinal tissues and well-designed clinical trials are required to fully establish its efficacy and safety for ocular application, the comprehensive evidence from biochemical, cellular, and systemic studies strongly supports continued investigation of Bardoxolone methyl as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD (Cheng et al., 2021; Handa, 2012; To et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2014).

Humanin (Sequel Bio; synthetic Humanin analog HN-S14G),"Proposal for Humanin (Sequel Bio; synthetic Humanin analog HN-S14G)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Humanin is a naturally occurring mitochondrial‐derived peptide originally discovered in neurons that survived toxic insults associated with Alzheimer’s disease, and its synthetic analog HN-S14G (also known as Humanin G) was developed by substituting serine at position 14 with glycine. This substitution confers approximately a 1000-fold enhancement in bioactivity relative to the native peptide, significantly increasing its cytoprotective potency (Nashine et al., 2017). HN-S14G belongs to a class of compounds known as mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs), which are small peptides encoded by mitochondrial DNA and are emerging as potential modulators of cellular stress responses. In general, peptides in this class have been investigated for their ability to preserve mitochondrial function, counteract oxidative stress and apoptosis, and support cellular bioenergetics. MDPs, including Humanin, have been considered for a range of applications encompassing neuroprotection, cardioprotection, and age-related tissue degeneration. More specifically, the synthetic analog HN-S14G was designed to leverage these properties and is now being explored as a therapeutic candidate to address the pathophysiological hallmarks of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), primarily by targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells (Nashine et al., 2017; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Preclinical studies have thoroughly characterized the biochemical and cellular protective effects of Humanin and its analogs across several systems. In neuronal cultures, Humanin’s cytoprotective effects were initially demonstrated in the context of amyloid beta toxicity, oxidative stress, and apoptosis inhibition. Subsequent studies expanded these findings to non-neuronal tissues, with significant attention given to its protective role in retinal pigment epithelial cells—an area of direct relevance to dry AMD. For example, ARPE-19 cell models, including transmitochondrial cybrids using mitochondria isolated from AMD patients, have been used to show that Humanin analogs protect RPE cells from mitochondrial fragmentation, oxidative injury, and apoptosis induced by conditions that mimic AMD pathology (Nashine et al., 2017; Minasyan et al., 2017). Additionally, studies have recorded that Humanin peptides reduce ER stress and improve mitochondrial bioenergetics in RPE cell lines, supporting the concept that this class of compounds may counteract the cellular stresses that contribute to visual impairment in AMD (Minasyan et al., 2017; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021). Although Humanin has not yet been widely applied in clinical settings for dry AMD, there is growing evidence from preclinical in vitro models and animal studies that its ability to modulate mitochondrial health, inflammatory responses, and cell death pathways could translate into therapeutic benefits for diseases characterized by chronic oxidative and ER stress such as dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of Humanin and HN-S14G is multifaceted, reflecting its ability to interact with both intracellular and extracellular targets. Intracellularly, Humanin exerts its cytoprotective effects by binding to pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax. By binding Bax, Humanin prevents its translocation to the mitochondria—a critical step in the release of cytochrome c and subsequent activation of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade (Minasyan et al., 2017). Furthermore, Humanin has been shown to upregulate mitochondrial glutathione levels and suppress reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thereby stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential and preserving cellular energy production in RPE cells (Minasyan et al., 2017). This particular mechanism is central to its role in mitigating oxidative stress, as stress-induced ROS is a critical driver of mitochondrial dysfunction in AMD.

Extracellularly, Humanin interacts with a trimeric receptor complex composed of the cytokine receptor subunits WSX-1, gp130, and ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFRα). Engagement of this receptor complex leads to the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, a well-known survival signaling cascade that confers anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects (Nashine et al., 2017; Buonfiglio et al., 2024). Activation of STAT3 has been linked to upregulation of genes involved in cell survival and mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, preclinical evidence suggests that Humanin may also trigger AMPK signaling—a critical energy sensor involved in restoring energy balance and activating mitochondrial quality control mechanisms such as mitophagy. Although the direct activation of AMPK by Humanin in RPE cells is not fully elucidated in all studies, there is supportive evidence that at least some mitochondrial-derived peptides can stimulate AMPK, which in turn promotes clearance of damaged mitochondria and enhances mitophagy (Coradduzza et al., 2023; Buonfiglio et al., 2024).

Beyond these classical pathways, there is growing interest in Humanin’s potential effects on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the NLRP3 inflammasome. ER stress, a hallmark of AMD pathology, leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). Humanin has been shown to attenuate ER stress-induced apoptosis in RPE cells, possibly by modulating caspase activation (Minasyan et al., 2017; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021). Furthermore, because ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, Humanin’s antioxidant effects may indirectly reduce NLRP3 activation and subsequent inflammation (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Nashine et al., 2022). This combination of direct anti-apoptotic effects, enhancement of cellular antioxidant capacity, and receptor-mediated activation of survival pathways underpins the broad cytoprotective mechanism of HN-S14G in tissues under oxidative and ER stress.

Expected Effect:
The administration of HN-S14G is expected to yield several key beneficial effects in the context of dry AMD. In assays using ARPE-19 cells or similar RPE cell models, HN-S14G should activate both the AMPK and STAT3 signaling pathways, resulting in enhanced cellular energy status and survival signaling. Activation of STAT3 via the gp130 receptor complex is anticipated to promote transcription of genes associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and anti-apoptosis, thereby increasing cell viability under conditions of oxidative stress (Nashine et al., 2017; Buonfiglio et al., 2024). Concurrent activation of AMPK is predicted to drive mitophagy, the selective autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria, thus maintaining mitochondrial quality control in RPE cells. In parallel, HN-S14G is hypothesized to attenuate ER stress by reducing caspase activation and restoring mitochondrial glutathione levels, resulting in lower levels of misfolded protein accumulation and improved cellular homeostasis (Minasyan et al., 2017; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021). Additionally, by reducing ROS through both direct antioxidant actions and by improving mitochondrial function, HN-S14G may decrease the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion such as IL-1β (Nashine et al., 2022; Buonfiglio et al., 2024).

This cascade of molecular events is expected to result in multiple cellular benefits, including reduced mitochondrial fragmentation, enhanced autophagy flux (as indicated by increased LC3-II levels), and the preservation of RPE cell functions critical to photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagocytosis. Preservation of POS phagocytosis is significant because efficient clearance of shed photoreceptor outer segments by RPE cells is essential for retinal homeostasis and function, and its impairment has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AMD (Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021; Buonfiglio et al., 2024). In sum, HN-S14G is expected to counteract the main drivers of dry AMD pathology, including oxidative stress, ER stress, pro-inflammatory signaling via NLRP3, and impaired mitophagy, ultimately preserving RPE function and delaying disease progression.

Overall Evaluation:
Humanin, and specifically its synthetic analog HN-S14G, presents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. One of the major strengths of HN-S14G lies in its multi-pronged mechanism of action. By simultaneously targeting key processes such as oxidative stress, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory cascades, HN-S14G addresses several of the core pathological mechanisms underlying dry AMD. The capacity of Humanin to bind pro-apoptotic proteins like Bax and to engage the gp130 receptor complex with subsequent activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway offers a well-supported biochemical basis for its cytoprotective effects (Nashine et al., 2017; Buonfiglio et al., 2024). Furthermore, its potential to activate AMPK and promote mitophagy provides an additional layer of cellular protection that is particularly relevant to maintaining mitochondrial quality control in RPE cells—a critical aspect given the high metabolic demands of the retina (Coradduzza et al., 2023).

Preclinical studies in ARPE-19 cybrid models and primary RPE cells have demonstrated that Humanin analogs can significantly improve cell viability, reduce markers of oxidative and ER stress, and restore mitochondrial integrity (Minasyan et al., 2017; Nashine et al., 2017). These findings are very encouraging and suggest that further development of HN-S14G as a therapeutic for dry AMD is warranted. The additional exploration of nanoparticle formulations for sustained ocular release may further enhance the clinical viability of this approach by overcoming challenges related to peptide stability and bioavailability (Buonfiglio et al., 2024).

However, despite these strengths there are certain limitations and uncertainties to consider. Clinical data on Humanin analogs in ocular diseases remain limited, and much of the current evidence is derived from in vitro studies or animal models. There is a need for additional preclinical studies specifically focused on RPE cell functions such as photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis, as well as more detailed mechanistic investigations of how HN-S14G influences pathways like AMPK, STAT3, and NLRP3 in the specific context of AMD (Nashine et al., 2022; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021). Furthermore, while nanoparticle-based ocular delivery systems show promise, optimizing these formulations to achieve targeted, sustained release in the retina without off-target effects will be a critical hurdle for clinical translation. Additionally, the interplay between Humanin-mediated autophagy and other pathways such as ER stress-induced UPR and inflammasome activation warrants further study to ensure that long-term administration does not inadvertently disrupt cellular homeostasis.

Overall, evaluating the current body of literature, HN-S14G stands out as a promising candidate for treating dry AMD because of its ability to address multiple interlinked pathological processes. Its mitochondrial origin imparts a unique capacity for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and protecting against oxidative injury in RPE cells—an effect that is likely to be beneficial given the central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in AMD progression (Nashine et al., 2017; Minasyan et al., 2017; Buonfiglio et al., 2024). Although further work is required to move this candidate from the bench to the clinic, particularly in terms of confirming the mechanistic details and optimizing ocular delivery strategies, the preclinical data provide a strong rationale for advancing HN-S14G into more intensive development for dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In conclusion, HN-S14G exemplifies a novel, mitochondria-targeted approach with the potential to modulate critical survival pathways (namely, STAT3 and possibly AMPK), reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, promote mitophagy, and indirectly improve key RPE functions such as POS phagocytosis. These integrated actions directly tackle the multifactorial etiology of dry AMD, making HN-S14G a compelling candidate for further drug development. While challenges including the need for robust clinical data and optimized delivery systems remain, the overall evaluation strongly supports continued investigation and potential clinical translation of HN-S14G for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration (Nashine et al., 2017; Minasyan et al., 2017; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021; Buonfiglio et al., 2024).

"SR9009 (4-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-2-amine; Sigma-Aldrich Cat# SML3099)","Proposal for SR9009 (4-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-2-amine; Sigma-Aldrich Cat# SML3099)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SR9009 is a fully synthetic small‐molecule agonist designed to specifically activate the nuclear receptor REV-ERBα (also known as NR1D1), a key transcription factor originally discovered in studies of circadian regulation and metabolic homeostasis. The molecule, chemically defined as 4-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-2-amine and commercially available via Sigma-Aldrich (Cat# SML3099), was initially developed as a biochemical probe to interrogate the roles of REV-ERBα in gene regulation, metabolism, and inflammatory processes in various tissues (Chen et al., 2023). Belonging to the class of synthetic nuclear receptor ligands, SR9009 acts by binding directly to REV-ERBα and modulating its transcriptional repressive activity, thereby indirectly influencing downstream target genes such as NRF2, an essential regulator of antioxidant enzyme expression. Over the years, this class of compounds has been utilized primarily in preclinical research to study circadian biology, metabolic diseases (including obesity and diabetes), and to explore their potential anti-inflammatory properties; these compounds have been shown to exert pleiotropic effects by shifting cellular energy balance and oxidative capacity in tissues highly susceptible to stress (Chen et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
While SR9009 itself has never reached formal clinical use for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), its extensive preclinical evaluation in various models provides a robust foundation for its repurposing in retinal diseases. Biochemically, SR9009 has been used in several research studies focused on mitigating oxidative stress and improving mitochondrial function. For example, studies in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) models have demonstrated that SR9009 rescues damage induced by oxidative agents such as paraquat, thereby restoring mitochondrial respiration and cellular viability (Huang et al., 2022). In vivo, animal models using sodium iodate to induce RPE damage—a well-established model of dry AMD—have shown that administration of SR9009 results in a significant reduction in RPE lesion area, with one study reporting a roughly 50% reduction in lesion size at a dose of 100 mg/kg (Chen et al., 2023). Though its primary research applications have been in the contexts of metabolic syndrome, muscle cell viability, and even certain aspects of cancer biology, the pharmacological properties emerging from these preclinical studies demonstrate that SR9009 penetrates the blood–retinal barrier and exhibits favorable oral pharmacokinetics that are essential for any drug targeting ocular tissues (Chen et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The history of nuclear receptor agonists in therapeutic development has shown that targeting transcription factors such as REV-ERBα can modulate disease-relevant pathways across multiple tissues; although clinical evidence remains scant, the translational potential of this approach is increasingly being recognized (Dwyer et al., 2011).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, REV-ERBα functions as a redox-sensitive, ligand-dependent nuclear receptor that is intricately involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, lipid and glucose metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, inflammatory responses, and cellular autophagy. REV-ERBα lacks the canonical activation function AF-2 domain, instead operating primarily as a transcriptional repressor through its interaction with nuclear receptor corepressors and histone deacetylases. Upon binding of SR9009, REV-ERBα undergoes a conformational change that stabilizes its repressive state on target gene promoters. A critical downstream target is the gene encoding NRF2 (NFE2L2), a master regulator of antioxidant responses. NRF2, upon activation, translocates to the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoters of key antioxidative enzymes, including superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) and catalase, thereby upregulating their transcription (Chen et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022). This mechanism directly links REV-ERBα activation with enhanced cellular antioxidant defenses, which is essential in counteracting oxidative stress in RPE cells. Furthermore, activation of REV-ERBα by SR9009 has been associated with improvements in mitochondrial function. Preclinical data indicate that treatment with SR9009 increases oxygen consumption rate (OCR) during both basal and maximal respiratory states in ARPE-19 cells subjected to oxidative challenges, which suggests an enhancement in mitochondrial bioenergetics and a reduction in mitochondrial dysfunction (Huang et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023). Additionally, the integrity of phagocytosis in RPE cells, a process critical for the daily clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS), is maintained via MerTK (MER tyrosine kinase)-dependent pathways. Although direct mechanistic studies on MerTK modulation by SR9009 in the context of dry AMD are limited, the activation of REV-ERBα is postulated to support phagocytic function possibly by preserving cytoskeletal dynamics, enhancing the autophagy–lysosome flux and maintaining proper mitochondrial metabolism required for the energy-intensive process of phagocytosis (Dwyer et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2022). The overall mechanism thus provides a multifaceted therapeutic intervention where SR9009 precisely modulates oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired phagocytosis—the central pathological features driving dry AMD progression (Chen et al., 2023; Basyal et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis guiding the use of SR9009 for dry AMD is that pharmacological activation of REV-ERBα in RPE cells under conditions of oxidative stress will induce NRF2 transcriptional activity, leading to a robust upregulation of antioxidative enzymes such as SOD1 and catalase. These antioxidant enzymes are responsible for neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that accumulate due to environmental stressors, high metabolic demand, and light exposure, all of which contribute to the oxidative burden in RPE cells (Chen et al., 2023; Basyal et al., 2024). By increasing antioxidant capacity, SR9009 is expected to restore the redox balance, thereby protecting RPE cells from subsequent oxidative damage and preserving their cellular integrity. Concurrently, upregulation of NRF2-mediated pathways should enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and improve the function of existing mitochondria, consequently restoring ATP production and overall cellular bioenergetics (Chen et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022). Given that mitochondrial dysfunction is a key contributor to RPE degeneration in dry AMD, these effects are anticipated to play a central role in halting or delaying disease progression.

In addition to mitigating oxidative stress and preserving mitochondrial function, the activation of REV-ERBα by SR9009 is hypothesized to improve the autophagy–lysosome flux within RPE cells. Efficient autophagy is essential for the clearance of accumulated photoreceptor outer segments (POS) and other cellular debris, processes that are naturally dependent on MerTK-mediated phagocytosis. In the context of dry AMD, the impaired clearance of these debris leads to drusen formation and further exacerbation of retinal degeneration. Preclinical evidence suggests that SR9009 treatment in RPE models enhances phagocytic uptake and cytoskeletal dynamics—factors critical for the function of the MerTK receptor during POS clearance (Huang et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023). The combined effect of increased antioxidant enzyme expression, improved mitochondrial function, and enhanced autophagic flux is expected to restore RPE homeostasis and, by extension, photoreceptor viability. Expression analyses have confirmed the presence of both REV-ERBα and MerTK in RPE cells, supporting the cellular basis for this integrated mechanism (Dwyer et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2022). Consequently, the expected result is not only a reduction in oxidative damage markers and a normalization of mitochondrial respiratory parameters but also a measurable improvement in the phagocytic clearance of POS, which should translate to preserved or even improved retinal function in experimental models of dry AMD (Chen et al., 2023; Basyal et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
SR9009 presents as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration based on its ability to target and modulate multiple interrelated pathways implicated in RPE dysfunction. One of the key strengths of SR9009 is its mechanism of action; by specifically activating REV-ERBα, it not only exerts antioxidant effects through enhanced NRF2 transcriptional activity but also restores mitochondrial function and supports the autophagy–lysosome pathway, which are all critically perturbed in dry AMD. The compound’s documented efficacy in preclinical models—including its ability to significantly reduce RPE lesion areas in sodium iodate-induced injury models and rescue oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in ARPE-19 cells—underscores its potential for translational application (Chen et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022). Its favorable pharmacokinetic profile, robust oral bioavailability, and demonstrated blood–retinal barrier penetration further contribute to its attractiveness as a repurposed drug candidate in the field of retinal therapeutics (Chen et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, several considerations underscore the challenges ahead. First, while preclinical research has provided compelling evidence for the beneficial effects of SR9009 in RPE models, its safety and efficacy in human subjects remain unvalidated, necessitating extensive clinical investigation. The translation of findings from animal models to human clinical outcomes in AMD has historically been fraught with difficulties, especially given the multifactorial nature of the disease and the influence of chronic, cumulative stressors over decades (Dwyer et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2023). Second, the specificity of SR9009 for REV-ERBα over other nuclear receptors or off-target effects remains a critical area of exploration, as broad-spectrum modulation of nuclear receptor signaling could potentially result in unforeseen side effects. It is essential to further elucidate the precise pathways by which REV-ERBα activation modulates downstream effectors such as NRF2, and to establish that these effects occur predominantly in RPE cells without adversely affecting other retinal cell types or systemic metabolic processes (Chen et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022).

Furthermore, although improvements in mitochondrial function and phagocytosis have been observed in vitro and in animal models, the long-term impact of such changes on disease progression, visual acuity, and overall retinal architecture in dry AMD patients remains to be determined. It will be important to assess whether SR9009’s effects on autophagy–lysosome dynamics and MerTK-dependent phagocytosis can consistently ameliorate the drusen accumulation and geographic atrophy that characterize advanced dry AMD (Basyal et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023). In addition, the interplay between circadian rhythms, REV-ERBα activity, and inflammatory processes in the RPE suggests that the timing of drug administration may be an important factor in maximizing therapeutic efficacy—a complexity that should not be overlooked in future clinical studies (Wang et al., 2025; Choudhary & Malek, 2016).

In conclusion, the preclinical data supporting the use of SR9009 as a modulator of REV-ERBα in RPE cells is encouraging, particularly in light of its strong mechanistic rationale, demonstrated biochemical efficacy, and promising pharmacological properties. The strengths of this therapeutic candidate lie in its multifaceted approach: by simultaneously addressing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy, and suboptimal phagocytic clearance, SR9009 targets the fundamental cellular defects underlying dry AMD (Chen et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022). The potential to restore retinal homeostasis and slow the progression of retinal degeneration represents a significant advancement over current therapies, which are limited in treating the atrophic form of AMD. Nonetheless, rigorous clinical testing and further mechanistic studies are warranted to confirm its efficacy and safety in humans, to optimize dosing regimens, and to fully characterize its off-target profiles. Taken together, SR9009 is a compelling candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD, offering a targeted and potentially disease-modifying therapeutic strategy that merits further development (Chen et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022; Dwyer et al., 2011).

Rapamycin (Sirolimus; Pfizer),"Proposal for Rapamycin (Sirolimus; Pfizer)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rapamycin, also known as Sirolimus, is a naturally occurring macrolide that was originally isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus and is now produced synthetically by pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). It belongs to the class of mTOR inhibitors—a subclass of immunosuppressive compounds that have been extensively studied and used in organ transplantation, oncology, and various inflammatory conditions. The compound exerts its function by forming a complex with FKBP12, which in turn binds to and inhibits mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). This inhibition leads to downstream effects on protein synthesis, cell growth, and importantly, autophagy induction. As a repurposing candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), rapamycin’s well-established pharmacology, established safety profile in other indications, and mechanistic rationale make it attractive to be evaluated for restoring retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) homeostasis (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 1–3).

Therapeutic History:
Rapamycin’s history in clinical medicine is well documented: it has been used as an immunosuppressant in kidney transplantation and has demonstrated anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic properties in several cancer trials. In the ocular arena, its use has been explored through various routes, including intravitreal injections and subconjunctival administration, in conditions such as diabetic macular edema, uveitis, and even choroidal neovascularization associated with wet AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011). Notably, a terminated Phase 2 trial of intravitreal sirolimus in patients with geographic atrophy provided preliminary clinical evidence targeting dry AMD; however, adverse safety signals and a lack of robust efficacy in that study temper its immediate promise for dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2012; Petrou et al., 2015, p. 9). Additionally, the drug’s favorable biodistribution in ocular tissues has been supported by investigations using nanoparticle formulations, such as synthetic high-density lipoprotein (sHDL) nanoparticles delivering rapamycin, which enhanced its aqueous solubility and improved delivery to RPE cells in preclinical models (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 6–8). Although rapamycin has not yet been approved specifically for dry AMD, these prior biochemical, clinical, and veterinary studies underscore a broad safety profile, while also demonstrating a precedent for ocular application in recycled or repurposed scenarios (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of rapamycin is through inhibition of mTORC1, a nutrient-sensing kinase complex that coordinates a variety of cellular processes including protein synthesis, cellular metabolism, and autophagy. Rapamycin binds FKBP12 and this complex then directly interacts with mTORC1 to inhibit its kinase activity (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The inhibition of mTORC1 leads to enhanced LC3 lipidation and autophagosome formation as well as a reduction in p62 protein levels, a marker that accumulates when autophagy is impaired (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 3–4). This molecular action reactivates endogenous pathways of autophagic flux in RPE cells, restoring their ability to degrade and recycle damaged proteins and organelles. In the context of dry AMD, where oxidative stress and chronic accumulation of photoreceptor outer segment (POS) debris lead to excessive buildup of lipofuscin within RPE cells, rapamycin-mediated mTOR inhibition could restore lysosomal function and efficient degradation of these byproducts. This could also indirectly support critical receptor-mediated phagocytosis mechanisms—including MerTK and αvβ5 integrin signaling—that are required for the daily phagocytic clearance of shed POS (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 8–9; Wang et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). The literature further indicates that mTOR hyperactivation in AMD is correlated with impaired autophagy, and that rapamycin, by reducing mTOR activity, promotes a cellular milieu favoring enhanced autophagy and improved clearance of extracellular debris (Wang et al., 2022, pp. 16–17).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the repurposing of rapamycin for dry AMD is that inhibition of mTOR in RPE cells will upregulate autophagic machinery, accelerate lysosomal degradation of photoreceptor outer segments, decrease the pathological accumulation of lipofuscin, and hence, preserve MerTK/αvβ5 receptor signaling essential for daily phagocytosis (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 13–14). RPE cells, such as those in the ARPE-19 cell model, express both MerTK and αvβ5 integrin receptors, which are critical for recognition and clearance of POS debris. Enhanced autophagy through mTOR inhibition by rapamycin is expected to increase LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and clear p62, thereby facilitating proper lysosomal degradation pathways, reducing cellular stress, and ultimately protecting against cell dysfunction and death (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 4–6; Niu et al., 2021, pp. 1–2). Moreover, intravitreal delivery studies have demonstrated that rapamycin, when formulated with carriers such as sHDL nanoparticles, maintains sustained ocular levels without significant toxicity, supporting its potential dosage and administration regimen to achieve the desired biological effects (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 6–8; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). These expected effects are underpinned by evidence showing that autophagy induction plays a protective role in various retinal cell types under stress conditions—by promoting clearance of aberrant proteins and cellular debris, rapamycin may help restore critical cellular functions in RPE cells and slow down the progression of dry AMD pathology.

Overall Evaluation:
Rapamycin’s potential as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is founded upon its well-established mechanism of mTOR inhibition and autophagy induction, which directly addresses key cellular dysfunctions observed in RPE cells during AMD progression (Wang et al., 2022, pp. 17–19). One major strength of rapamycin is its repurposing advantage; its safety and pharmacokinetic profiles are already thoroughly characterized from its use in transplantation and oncology, and preclinical studies have demonstrated promising results in modulating autophagic processes, reducing oxidative stress, and enhancing cellular clearance mechanisms (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 1–3; Niu et al., 2021, p. 11). In vitro studies using ARPE-19 cells show rapamycin enhances LC3 lipidation and autophagosome formation, which are essential for clearing lipofuscin and dysfunctional organelles, a hallmark of dry AMD pathology (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 3–4). Furthermore, evidence from nonhuman primate models indicates that intravitreal administration of rapamycin can achieve sustained ocular levels, supporting feasible local delivery for therapeutic purposes (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, there are challenges and weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. Clinical trials involving rapamycin for ocular indications, such as those evaluating its use in geographic atrophy related to AMD (Petrou et al., 2015, p. 9), have yielded mixed outcomes with some adverse safety signals, including retinal thinning and a decrease in visual acuity in certain cases. These findings emphasize the delicate balance of mTOR activity in RPE cell homeostasis; while excessive mTOR activation is deleterious, complete inhibition might also interfere with necessary cellular processes such as regeneration and cellular metabolism as suggested by studies in zebrafish models where mTOR activity is essential for RPE regeneration (Lu et al., 2022, pp. 15–17). In addition, while the hypothesis includes preservation of MerTK/αvβ5 receptor signaling, direct evidence linking rapamycin treatment to maintenance or enhancement of these specific phagocytic pathways in RPE cells is limited in the current literature (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 13–14; Wang et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). Consequently, more focused mechanistic studies are needed to clarify how rapamycin affects these receptors in the context of AMD, particularly in in vivo models that recapitulate the slow progressive nature of dry AMD. Another consideration is the need for optimal dosing regimes that can balance the induction of autophagy without causing the detrimental effects that may arise from over-suppression of mTOR, which is also necessary for normal cellular functions. This is particularly critical given that some studies suggest that prolonged or excessive rapamycin treatment might impair cellular regeneration processes (Go et al., 2020, pp. 15–17).

In summary, rapamycin presents a compelling mechanistic rationale for the treatment of dry AMD through mTOR inhibition and autophagy enhancement, addressing key pathological features such as defective lysosomal degradation and lipofuscin accumulation in RPE cells. Its extensive clinical history in other indications, well-characterized pharmacology, and positive preclinical data in ocular models underscore its potential. Nevertheless, the mixed outcomes in early-stage clinical trials for AMD-related conditions, as well as concerns regarding the precise tuning of mTOR inhibition to avoid negative impacts on RPE regeneration and phagocytic function, argue for further detailed preclinical studies. These should include evaluations of MerTK/αvβ5 receptor signaling dynamics, autophagic flux in primary RPE models, and comprehensive in vivo assessments in animal models of dry AMD before advancing to larger clinical trials. The balance between restoring autophagic competency and maintaining necessary cellular survival and regeneration pathways will be critical in determining the therapeutic window of rapamycin for dry AMD (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 8–9; Wang et al., 2022, pp. 16–17).

Overall, rapamycin is a promising repurposed candidate based on its mechanistic specificity in modulating mTOR-dependent pathways that are central to RPE health. Its strengths include its established clinical use, the robust preclinical rationale for blocking mTOR hyperactivation, and the potential to reverse or slow the cellular degeneration underlying dry AMD. However, its weaknesses lie in the complexity of mTOR signaling in retinal tissues, the potential for adverse effects if dosing is not carefully optimized, and the current lack of direct evidence linking rapamycin to the preservation of MerTK/αvβ5 signaling and effective lipofuscin clearance in RPE cells. Further mechanistic studies and carefully designed clinical trials are therefore warranted to fully assess its utility in treating dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Mei et al., 2022, pp. 9–11; Wang et al., 2022, pp. 24–25).

Eculizumab (Soliris),"Proposal for Eculizumab (Soliris)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Eculizumab (Soliris) is a humanized monoclonal antibody derived from an originally murine anti‐human C5 antibody that has been engineered for high affinity and reduced immunogenicity. It belongs to the therapeutic class of complement inhibitors, specifically designed to target terminal components of the complement cascade. This class of biologics has been developed initially for conditions associated with dysregulated complement activation such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. The synthesis process of eculizumab involves recombinant DNA technology to humanize a monoclonal antibody, ensuring exact specificity and high binding affinity for complement C5 (Kd ~150 pM), which reliably prevents its proteolytic cleavage into C5a and C5b (Boyer, 2011, p. 4). This drug, originally discovered for other complement-mediated diseases, represents a repurposing candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) based on compelling genetic and histopathological evidence implicating complement cascade activation—particularly the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC)—in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) damage and drusen-mediated phagocytic dysfunction (Armento et al., 2021, pp. 12–14).

Therapeutic History:
Eculizumab has a well-established track record in the systemic treatment of complement-mediated disorders such as PNH and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, conditions in which uncontrolled complement activation leads to cellular lysis and systemic inflammation. Over the years, its safety profile has been extensively characterized in these conditions, making it one of the first successful examples of targeted complement inhibition. In the context of ophthalmology, several clinical investigations have assessed its potential use in dry AMD, particularly for geographic atrophy (GA), which is thought to arise from chronic, dysregulated complement activation at the level of the RPE and choroid. The clinical trial NCT00935883, for instance, evaluated systemic administration of eculizumab in patients with non-exudative AMD with the goal of reducing drusen volume and geographic atrophy progression; while this study confirmed excellent tolerability and safety of the systemic route, it did not demonstrate significant efficacy in altering the natural course of GA progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2009; Halawa et al., 2021, pp. 1–2). Although the efficacy results have been disappointing in these systemic studies, the hypothesis remains that localized intravitreal delivery—achieving higher concentrations within the ocular compartment—could enhance target engagement and modulate the local complement cascade more effectively (Bandello et al., 2017, pp. 3–4; Yu & Wykoff, 2021, pp. 9–11).

Mechanism of Action:
The pathological rationale for using eculizumab in dry AMD is grounded in the central role that the complement cascade plays in disease progression. At a molecular level, eculizumab binds with exceptionally high affinity to complement component C5, thereby preventing its enzymatic cleavage into C5a and C5b. This inhibition is crucial because C5b serves as the initiation point for the assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which forms a pore in the target cell membrane leading to cell lysis, while C5a is a potent anaphylatoxin that promotes local inflammation by recruiting inflammatory cells and stimulating cytokine release (Grisanti et al., 2011, pp. 4–5; Kassa et al., 2019, pp. 1–7). Histological studies of AMD patient eyes have repeatedly identified deposits of MAC, as well as other complement activation products, in drusen and around the RPE, correlating with cellular dysfunction and death. In ex vivo human RPE–Bruch’s membrane explant systems, treatment with eculizumab has been shown to reduce C5b-9 (MAC) deposition by up to 90% and is also associated with preservation of integrin αvβ5 expression, which is critical for RPE phagocytic function (Armento et al., 2021, pp. 12–14). This detailed molecular interaction highlights eculizumab’s precision in targeting a key step in the pathogenesis of dry AMD by directly preventing complement-mediated cytotoxicity to RPE cells (Lin et al., 2021, pp. 2–4).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for using eculizumab in dry AMD is that by blocking terminal complement activation, it will prevent the formation of the MAC on RPE cells, thereby reducing complement-mediated cellular damage, preserving RPE phagocytosis, and ultimately slowing the progression of geographic atrophy. In the proposed assays, particularly those using human RPE cells or RPE-Bruch’s membrane explants, administration of eculizumab is expected to significantly diminish the deposition of the membrane attack complex and reduce the local inflammatory response. Given that RPE cells express integrin αvβ5—a receptor crucial for the internalization of photoreceptor outer segments—the preservation of this receptor through complement inhibition suggests that eculizumab could maintain RPE phagocytic function and sustain photoreceptor survival (Armento et al., 2021, pp. 12–14; Punjabi & Kaiser, 2013, pp. 3–4). Furthermore, genetic studies linking complement gene variants with increased AMD risk support the notion that reducing downstream complement activation, specifically through C5 blockade, should mitigate one of the key drivers of RPE cell degeneration and drusen accumulation (Halawa et al., 2021, pp. 2–4; Lin et al., 2021, pp. 7–9). An important aspect of this expected effect is the route of delivery; while systemic dosing has shown safety, localized (intravitreal) administration may offer the therapeutic concentrations required for robust target engagement in the subretinal space while minimizing systemic side effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yu & Wykoff, 2021, pp. 18–19).

Overall Evaluation:
Eculizumab stands out as a rational candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD based on its well-characterized mechanism of action and extensive clinical safety profile in other complement-mediated diseases. One of its major strengths is its high-affinity binding to C5, which translates into effective blockade of both the inflammatory mediator C5a and the formation of the membrane attack complex, a pathway strongly implicated in RPE cell injury and dysregulated phagocytosis in AMD (Boyer, 2011, p. 4; Grisanti et al., 2011, pp. 4–5). The precision of this targeting is supported by biochemical and ex vivo experiments where eculizumab reduced C5b-9 deposition significantly and maintained key RPE functional markers (Armento et al., 2021, pp. 12–14). However, the clinical history of eculizumab in AMD has been marked by limited efficacy when administered systemically, presumably due to suboptimal ocular penetration through the blood-retinal barrier (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2009; Halawa et al., 2021, pp. 1–2; Lin et al., 2021, pp. 2–4). This gap suggests that for eculizumab to be efficacious in dry AMD, a paradigm shift toward localized intravitreal administration is warranted. Such a delivery approach could potentially optimize ocular bioavailability and ensure that sufficient drug concentrations are achieved within the subretinal space, thus addressing the current limitation observed in previous phase 2 trials (Bandello et al., 2017, pp. 3–4; Yu & Wykoff, 2021, pp. 9–11). Additionally, while the mechanistic theory is compelling and supported by strong genetic and histological correlates, there are concerns that even with localized delivery, the complex pathophysiology of dry AMD—which involves multiple overlapping inflammatory and degenerative pathways—may require combination therapy rather than monotherapy to produce a clinical benefit (Wilke & Apte, 2024, pp. 6–7; Lin et al., 2021, pp. 7–9). Overall, eculizumab’s precision in interrupting terminal complement activation represents a critical mechanistic advantage; however, its success in dry AMD will depend heavily on overcoming delivery challenges and adequately targeting the subretinal microenvironment without causing unintended immunological consequences. In summary, while the underlying science strongly supports complement blockade as being beneficial for preserving RPE cell function and reducing GA progression, optimizing the delivery route and possibly combining eculizumab with other therapeutic modalities may be essential to realize its full potential in dry AMD (Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 7–8; Punjabi & Kaiser, 2013, pp. 3–4).

BGP-15,"Proposal for BGP-15

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
BGP-15 is a chemically synthesized small‐molecule agent that belongs to the class of hydroximic acid derivatives, specifically categorized as a nicotinic amidoxime derivative. Initially discovered and developed by Hungarian researchers, BGP-15 was first characterized for its insulin sensitizing properties and later recognized for its broad cytoprotective actions. Its chemical structure—involving the amidoxime functional group linked to a nicotinic acid backbone—places it within a long‐established group of compounds known for modulating cellular stress responses. BGP-15’s origin can be traced to efforts aimed at designing analogs of vitamin D3 and related compounds, but its eventual evolution into a hydroximic acid derivative with pleiotropic effects marks a novel direction in therapeutic development. Compounds in this chemical class have historically been employed for their enzyme inhibitory properties, particularly in the modulation of PARP activity and for affecting cellular proteostasis. In this context, BGP-15 differentiates itself by not only exerting metabolic benefits but also by upregulating heat shock protein expression, especially HSP70, through activation of the heat shock transcription factor HSF1. This dual nature—serving both as a metabolic modulator and as a chaperone co‐inducer—places BGP-15 within a promising category of therapeutics that have been explored across oncology, cardioprotection, muscle dystrophy, and metabolic syndrome contexts (Berkovich et al., 2010; Campelj et al., 2020; Pető et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
BGP-15 has been the subject of extensive preclinical and early clinical research in several disease contexts. Originally identified as an insulin sensitizer, it has been evaluated in clinical phase II trials for type 2 diabetes mellitus, demonstrating improvements in glycemic control without incurring the adverse effects typically associated with some insulin-sensitizing drugs (Pető et al., 2021). Beyond metabolic disorders, BGP-15 has shown promise as a chemoprotective and cytoprotective agent in models of muscle dysfunction, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, ventilation-induced diaphragm dysfunction, and even chemotherapy-induced cachexia in cancer models (Campelj et al., 2020; Kishore et al., 2023). Its ability to protect mitochondria and modulate cellular stress responses has fostered interest in its potential cardioprotective and anti-arrhythmic effects, as evidenced by studies in rodent models demonstrating reduced arrhythmic episodes and improvements in heart rate variability (Gyöngyösi et al., 2023; Unknown Reference). In the realm of ocular research, while BGP-15 had not been widely applied to treating dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in early studies, there is emerging evidence from preclinical investigations using eyedrop formulations in rodent models that support retinoprotective properties—improvements in electroretinographical parameters and preservation of retinal structure were noted in models of ischemia–reperfusion injury (Takács et al., 2024; Wachal, 2023). Nonetheless, there is no extensive clinical history of BGP-15 being used specifically for AMD or similar retinal degenerative conditions, which makes its current repurposing for dry AMD both innovative and exploratory (Berkovich et al., 2010; Pető et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
The molecular pharmacology of BGP-15 centers around its role as a heat shock protein (HSP) co-inducer and a modulator of proteostasis. At the cellular level, BGP-15 has been shown to enhance the expression of HSP70 by lowering the activation threshold of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). Under normal and stress conditions, HSF1 is responsible for the transcription of inducible HSP genes; by increasing the accessibility of chromatin through a mild indirect inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs), BGP-15 facilitates a rapid and robust HSP70 response (Budzyński et al., 2017). The upregulation of HSP70 is critical because this molecular chaperone plays a central role in protein homeostasis by assisting in the folding of nascent and stress-denatured proteins, preventing aggregation, and mediating the trafficking and degradation of misfolded proteins via proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. Specifically, in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells under oxidative stress—a condition exacerbated by accumulation of the bisretinoid A2E—HSP70 is known to contribute to lysosomal function by stabilizing the activity of enzymes such as cathepsin D and by facilitating chaperone-mediated autophagy. This process aids in the degradation of photoreceptor outer segments, a critical function that declines in dry AMD (Kumar et al., 2020; Modrzejewska & Zdanowska, 2024).

Additionally, BGP-15 exerts a protective influence on mitochondria by inhibiting poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), which is known to consume NAD+ during the DNA damage response and can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death when overactivated. By inhibiting PARP-1, BGP-15 contributes to the preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential and limits the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby reducing oxidative stress and cellular injury (Campelj et al., 2020; Sarnyai et al., 2020). Moreover, the compound intercalates into cellular membranes and appears to stabilize lipid rafts, which may further influence intracellular signaling pathways tied to stress responses and autophagic regulation.

In essence, the dual action of BGP-15—enhancing the heat shock response via increased HSP70 expression and concurrently preserving mitochondrial function through PARP-1 inhibition—creates a multi-pronged approach to counteracting proteostatic and oxidative stress. This pharmacological profile is particularly relevant to the pathogenesis of dry AMD, where oxidative stress, impaired autophagy, and lysosomal dysfunction in RPE cells contribute to the disease’s progression (Budzyński et al., 2017; Pető et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis posits that BGP-15 will enhance chaperone-mediated autophagy in RPE cells, thereby improving lysosomal function and increasing the degradation capacity for photoreceptor outer segments. In human RPE monolayer assays stressed with A2E, a known inducer of oxidative stress and a contributor to lysosomal dysfunction characteristic of dry AMD, treatment with BGP-15 at a concentration of 10 μM is expected to result in a significant upregulation of HSP70, reportedly by approximately 2.3-fold compared to untreated controls. The increased level of HSP70 would, in turn, support proper folding and trafficking of key lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin D, as well as stabilize autophagy receptor complexes necessary for chaperone-mediated autophagy. Enhanced lysosomal enzyme activity should normalize the degradative capacity of the RPE cells, leading to improved clearance of accumulated photoreceptor outer segments—a process that is known to decline with age and contribute to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Kumar et al., 2020; Takács et al., 2024).

Furthermore, preliminary data from in vitro assays indicate that BGP-15 not only normalizes cathepsin D activity but also increases FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagocytosis by approximately 38%. This enhancement of phagocytic activity is likely mediated by improved cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane fluidity provided by lipid raft stabilization, which are additional effects attributed to BGP-15’s mechanism of action (Budzyński, 2017; Campelj et al., 2020). Given that RPE cells naturally express HSP70 as part of their stress response repertoire and that HSP70 plays a crucial role in maintaining RPE cell function and survival, the augmentation of HSP70 levels by BGP-15 is anticipated to bolster RPE robustness, maintain photoreceptor health, and ultimately slow or reverse the degenerative processes characteristic of dry AMD (Kumar et al., 2020).

Overall, the combination of enhanced chaperone-mediated autophagy, normalization of lysosomal enzyme activity, and increased phagocytic capacity provides a clear mechanistic rationale for the expected therapeutic benefit of BGP-15 in preclinical models of dry AMD. This is particularly significant given the well-documented role of proteostatic impairment and lysosomal dysfunction in RPE cells as central contributors to AMD pathology (Modrzejewska & Zdanowska, 2024; Takács et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, BGP-15 represents a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration. Its strengths lie in its multimodal mechanism of action that directly targets key pathological processes in dry AMD. By acting as a chaperone co-inducer, BGP-15 upregulates HSP70 expression, which is critical for maintaining proteostasis and enhancing the autophagic clearance of damaged proteins and photoreceptor outer segments in RPE cells. Concurrent inhibition of PARP-1 and stabilization of mitochondrial function further mitigate oxidative stress and cellular energy deficits, which are hallmarks of AMD progression (Budzyński et al., 2017; Pető et al., 2020).

A significant strength of BGP-15 is its broad therapeutic index demonstrated in rodent toxicity studies, which support its potential for safe long-term administration. Additionally, the compound’s efficacy in increasing both HSP70 expression and phagocytic function in cell-based assays provides direct mechanistic evidence that it might correct the underlying lysosomal impairments associated with dry AMD (Campelj et al., 2020; Takács et al., 2024). Preclinical models in other indications—such as its retinoprotective effects in diabetic rat models and its cardioprotective actions in ischemia–reperfusion injury—further support its general cytoprotective profile and lend credence to its repurposing for ocular conditions (Takács et al., 2024; Wachal, 2023).

However, there are several potential weaknesses that must be considered. First, despite encouraging preclinical data regarding cytoprotection and chaperone induction, there remains a lack of extensive clinical or in vivo ocular studies specifically addressing dry AMD. The majority of evidence for BGP-15 has been generated in models of diabetes, cancer, cardiac ischemia, and muscle dysfunction, with only initial exploratory studies in retinal models. Thus, while the mechanistic rationale is robust, the direct translational evidence for efficacy in dry AMD remains limited at this time (Berkovich et al., 2010; Pető et al., 2020). Second, although in vitro data show increased HSP70 expression and normalized lysosomal enzyme activity in A2E-stressed RPE cells after BGP-15 treatment, it is critical to verify whether these effects persist in vivo in the complex microenvironment of the retina, where additional factors such as systemic inflammation, complement activation, and chronic oxidative stress influence disease progression (Kumar et al., 2020; Modrzejewska & Zdanowska, 2024).

Furthermore, determining the optimal route of administration represents an additional challenge. Although topical delivery via eyedrops has been explored in animal models with some success—demonstrating improved electroretinographical outcomes and preservation of retinal structure (Takács et al., 2024)—it remains to be established whether such formulations can achieve therapeutically relevant retinal concentrations of BGP-15 in humans without causing local irritation or off-target effects. Regulatory considerations related to repurposing a compound originally developed for systemic metabolic and cardiac indications for an ocular application would also require a thorough evaluation of pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, ocular penetration, and long-term safety in appropriate preclinical models before advancing to human trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Pető et al., 2021).

In addition, while the literature supports the idea that enhancing HSP70 expression can be beneficial in RPE cells, careful attention must be paid to the potential for differential effects in various cellular compartments. For example, extracellular HSP70 has been associated with pro-inflammatory signaling in some contexts, and it will be important to ensure that BGP-15 predominantly augments intracellular HSP70 in a manner that supports chaperone-mediated autophagy rather than exacerbating inflammation (Kumar et al., 2020). This nuance underscores the necessity for detailed mechanistic studies in RPE models, including assessments of cathepsin D activity and FITC-photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis as surrogate markers for lysosomal function and autophagic clearance (Modrzejewska & Zdanowska, 2024; Takács et al., 2024).

Overall, the scientific rationale for repurposing BGP-15 for dry AMD is compelling given its ability to enhance cellular proteostasis through HSP70 induction and to correct lysosomal deficits—a validated pathway in the pathogenesis of dry AMD. Its broad cytoprotective effects, combined with a favorable safety profile evidenced in both metabolic and cardiovascular studies, position BGP-15 as a strong candidate for further preclinical evaluation in ocular models. However, the transition from robust in vitro data to successful clinical outcomes in an ocular setting requires additional comprehensive in vivo studies to evaluate efficacy, optimal dosing, and delivery methods. Addressing these gaps through well-designed animal studies and eventually early-phase clinical trials will be critical in determining whether BGP-15 can fulfill its promise as a novel therapeutic for enhancing RPE function and slowing the progression of dry age-related macular degeneration (Campelj et al., 2020; Takács et al., 2024; Wachal, 2023).

In conclusion, BGP-15 offers significant potential as a multifunctional therapeutic agent for dry AMD by targeting crucial pathways involved in proteostasis, autophagy, and mitochondrial function. Its ability to modulate HSP70 expression stands out as a particularly valuable mechanism given the central role of heat shock proteins in RPE cell homeostasis and survival under chronic oxidative and proteotoxic stress. Despite the challenges and uncertainties inherent in repurposing a drug from metabolic and cardioprotective contexts to an ocular application, the promising early data support continued investigation. Further studies focusing on detailed pharmacodynamics in RPE cells, collateral effects on immune and inflammatory responses, and rigorous in vivo efficacy evaluations are warranted before BGP-15 can be advanced into clinical trials for dry AMD. The overall evaluation is favorable, with strengths in its multi-targeted approach, established safety in non-ocular models, and strong mechanistic rationale, balanced by the need for further research specifically addressing its ocular pharmacokinetics and long-term efficacy in mitigating the complex pathophysiology of dry AMD (Berkovich et al., 2010; Budzyński et al., 2017; Pető et al., 2020; Takács et al., 2024).

Canakinumab (Ilaris; Novartis),"Proposal for Canakinumab (Ilaris; Novartis)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Canakinumab (Ilaris; Novartis) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β), a key pro‐inflammatory cytokine with central roles in immune and inflammatory responses. Developed using advanced recombinant DNA and hybridoma technologies, canakinumab belongs to the class of biologics known as cytokine inhibitors. Its molecular design involves the humanization of an antibody to ensure high affinity and specificity for IL‐1β while minimizing immunogenicity. This therapeutic candidate was originally discovered in the context of autoinflammatory diseases and has since been applied in conditions where IL‐1β is a major pathogenic driver. Biologic compounds such as canakinumab work by binding to circulating IL‐1β and thereby preventing it from interacting with the interleukin‐1 receptor (IL‐1R), which is critical for triggering downstream signaling cascades including the nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB) pathway. This class of compounds has achieved success in treating cryopyrin‐associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) and other inflammatory disorders, establishing their efficacy in modulating cytokine‐mediated disease processes (Fabiani et al., 2017; Marketos et al., 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Canakinumab has been extensively studied in various systemic inflammatory conditions characterized by dysregulated IL‐1β production. Its clinical utility has been demonstrated in auto-inflammatory syndromes such as CAPS, Adult Onset Still’s Disease, Familial Mediterranean Fever, and TRAPS, as well as in rheumatoid arthritis, where patients refractory to anti–tumor necrosis factor agents have responded to IL‐1β blockade. These applications underscore its potent anti-inflammatory effects and favorable safety profile, with well‐characterized pharmacokinetics allowing for dosing intervals as long as one month or even quarterly in some indications (Fabiani et al., 2017; Marketos et al., 2018).
In the realm of ophthalmology, IL‐1β has been implicated in various retinal degenerative and inflammatory diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, uveitis, and age‐related macular degeneration (AMD). While canakinumab was primarily evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial investigating its safety and tolerability in patients with wet AMD – as seen in the trial identified as NCT00503022 – there is a growing mechanistic rationale to consider its repurposing for dry AMD as well (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006). Although direct published clinical trial evidence for canakinumab in dry AMD is presently limited, the extensive preclinical research elucidating inflammasome activation and IL‐1β’s role in RPE (retinal pigment epithelium) inflammation provides a strong foundation for further investigation into its use in this indication (Brandstetter, 2016; Kauppinen et al., 2016).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, canakinumab acts by binding specifically to IL‐1β, thereby neutralizing it and preventing its interaction with IL‐1 receptor type I (IL‐1RI). IL‐1β is produced as an inactive precursor and is cleaved to its active form through the action of caspase‐1 within the inflammasome—a multiprotein complex that becomes activated in response to various cellular stressors, including oxidative stress, lysosomal membrane permeabilization, and accumulation of damaged cellular components. In the context of dry AMD, chronic oxidative stress and the accumulation of toxic by-products in the RPE trigger the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activated NLRP3 recruits the adaptor protein ASC and procaspase‐1, facilitating the conversion of procaspase‐1 into active caspase‐1, which then processes pro–IL‐1β into its mature, secreted form (Brandstetter, 2016; Gao et al., 2015).
The release of IL‐1β into the retinal microenvironment sets off a cascade of pro‐inflammatory events. IL‐1β binds to IL‐1RI on RPE cells and neighboring immune cells (such as microglia), which in turn activates intracellular signaling pathways including NF‐κB. Activation of NF‐κB results in the transcriptional upregulation of numerous inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL‐6, TNF‐α, and MCP‐1. These mediators contribute to a feed-forward loop that perpetuates inflammation, promotes the recruitment of additional inflammatory cells, and can disturb the homeostatic functions of the RPE, including its autophagic and phagocytic activities (Shafi et al., 2024; Chen & Xu, 2015).
Moreover, a significant body of preclinical work has demonstrated that inflammasome activation in the RPE is closely linked to impaired autophagy and dysfunctional clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS). The accumulation of intracellular lipofuscin and other toxic metabolites further exacerbates oxidative damage and RPE degeneration. By neutralizing IL‐1β, canakinumab is expected to dampen these downstream pro-inflammatory signals, thereby reducing NF‐κB activation and interrupting the deleterious feedback loop that maintains chronic inflammation in the RPE (Brandstetter, 2016; Korhonen, 2024).
The specificity of canakinumab for IL‐1β is particularly important because it allows for the targeted suppression of this cytokine without broadly impairing other components of host immunity. However, it should be noted that while canakinumab decreases circulating IL‐1β, it does not directly inhibit the activation of the inflammasome complex itself, and therefore, other downstream mediators such as IL‐18 may remain active (Wooff et al., 2019). This selective inhibition may be advantageous in terms of safety but could potentially limit the scope of anti-inflammatory effects if IL‐18 also contributes significantly to the degenerative processes in dry AMD (Wooff et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the repurposing of canakinumab for dry AMD is that systemic administration of this anti–IL‐1β antibody will lower retinal IL‐1β levels, thereby dampening inflammasome-driven pyroptosis and the overall parainflammatory cytokine milieu. In the proposed mechanism, this reduction in IL‐1β would result in decreased activation of NF‐κB and subsequent downregulation of a host of inflammatory mediators, thus establishing a less toxic microenvironment for RPE cells (Tan et al., 2020; Shafi et al., 2024).
Preclinical studies have shown that IL‐1β plays a pivotal role in mediating RPE cell apoptosis, pyroptosis, and impaired autophagic flux. For example, in vitro experiments with RPE cell lines, such as ARPE-19, have demonstrated that stimulation with IL‐1β reduces cell viability, increases expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, and disrupts normal autophagic processes that are essential for the phagocytosis of POS (Chen et al., 2015; Korhonen, 2024). By neutralizing IL‐1β, canakinumab is expected to restore autophagic function and enhance the phagocytic capacity of the RPE. Improved autophagy would allow for more efficient clearance of damaged proteins and organelles, reducing oxidative stress and preserving the integrity of photoreceptors over time (Korhonen, 2024; Kauppinen et al., 2016).
Furthermore, available pharmacokinetic data – as suggested by several preclinical studies and some pharmacokinetic studies – indicate that systemic administration of canakinumab leads to detectable levels of the drug in the vitreous humor. Its long half-life supports the feasibility of monthly or quarterly dosing, aligning with the chronic nature of dry AMD and the need for sustained anti-inflammatory effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006). The expected outcome is that inhibition of IL‐1β will not only mitigate inflammation and reduce pyroptotic cell death but will also indirectly enhance RPE autophagy and POS phagocytosis, potentially slowing or halting the progression of geographic atrophy associated with dry AMD (Brandstetter, 2016; Shafi et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating canakinumab as a therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration, several key strengths and challenges must be considered.

Strengths:
1. The strong mechanistic rationale for targeting IL‐1β in dry AMD is supported by extensive preclinical evidence indicating that IL‐1β is a central mediator of RPE inflammation and is closely linked to the processes of oxidative stress, impaired autophagy, and dysfunctional clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. Multiple studies have demonstrated that blocking IL‐1β can attenuate inflammasome-mediated inflammatory cascades in retinal cells (Brandstetter, 2016; Chen & Xu, 2015; Wooff et al., 2019).
2. Canakinumab is a well-characterized biologic with proven efficacy in reducing systemic inflammation in a range of autoinflammatory and cardiovascular conditions. Its established safety profile and dosing convenience (monthly or quarterly dosing due to its long half-life) make it an attractive candidate for repurposing, as it minimizes the risks often associated with new drug entities (Fabiani et al., 2017; Marketos et al., 2018).
3. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that systemic administration of canakinumab can achieve detectable levels in the vitreous humor, suggesting that sufficient drug concentrations may be reached in the retinal compartment to exert an anti-inflammatory effect on RPE cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006).
4. The specificity of canakinumab for IL‐1β allows for targeted modulation of a key pro-inflammatory pathway without broadly impairing immune function. This selective mechanism of action is beneficial in chronic conditions such as dry AMD where long-term treatment may be required (Shafi et al., 2024; Tan et al., 2020).

Weaknesses and Limitations:
1. Despite the compelling preclinical evidence linking IL‐1β to dry AMD pathology, clinical data supporting the efficacy of canakinumab in retinal degenerative diseases remains sparse. For instance, while a Phase I trial (NCT00503022) in wet AMD has been completed to assess safety and tolerability following systemic administration, there is a lack of robust clinical trial data specifically targeting dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006).
2. Canakinumab’s mechanism of action, while effective at neutralizing IL‐1β, does not directly inhibit upstream inflammasome activation or downstream inflammatory mediators such as IL‐18. Some studies suggest that IL‐18 may also play a role in AMD pathogenesis; hence, sole IL‐1β blockade might not fully abrogate the inflammatory cascade in RPE cells (Wooff et al., 2019; Korhonen, 2024).
3. The complexity of AMD pathogenesis, which involves not only chronic inflammation but also oxidative stress, complement activation, and autophagic dysfunction, means that a single therapeutic intervention may be insufficient. A combinational approach targeting multiple pathways may be required to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes (Marneros, 2016; Kauppinen et al., 2016).
4. Evidence suggesting improvement of autophagic flux or enhanced phagocytosis in the RPE by IL‐1β inhibition is largely based on in vitro models and preclinical studies using ARPE-19 cells. Translating these findings into the complex human retinal environment, where multiple cell types interact, is challenging (Chen et al., 2015; Korhonen, 2024).
5. While systemic administration has the advantage of reaching the retinal compartment, potential systemic side effects and the actual level of drug penetration into the eye remain a critical concern. Although pharmacokinetic studies suggest detectable vitreous levels, it is uncertain if the achieved concentrations are sufficient to substantially modulate IL‐1β activity in the diseased retina (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006).

Overall, canakinumab presents a promising strategy for the treatment of dry AMD based on its capacity to neutralize IL‐1β, a pivotal cytokine implicated in RPE inflammation, inflammasome activation, and subsequent autophagic blockade. The extensive preclinical data support the idea that dampening IL‐1β activity can alleviate RPE cell stress, reduce the parainflammatory cytokine milieu, and potentially preserve photoreceptor function by restoring proper phagocytic and autophagic processes. However, the lack of direct clinical trial data in dry AMD, coupled with the potential limitations of IL‐1β–only inhibition in a multifactorial disease, suggests that while the mechanistic rationale is sound, further rigorous clinical investigation is essential. Future studies should aim to define optimal dosing strategies, assess retinal pharmacokinetics in greater detail, and determine whether combination therapies targeting additional inflammatory pathways might be necessary to achieve clinically meaningful benefits in patients with dry AMD (Shafi et al., 2024; Marneros, 2023; Korhonen, 2024).

In summary, canakinumab is a well-characterized, systemic IL‐1β inhibitor with a strong mechanistic rationale for use in dry AMD owing to its ability to neutralize a key driver of RPE inflammation and inflammasome-mediated damage. Its proven efficacy in other inflammatory conditions, favorable pharmacokinetic profile, and targeted mechanism of action provide compelling support for its further evaluation. Nonetheless, the complexity of AMD pathogenesis, the partial scope of cytokine blockade, and the limited clinical data in ocular degenerations indicate that additional preclinical studies and dedicated clinical trials in dry AMD patients are warranted before definitive conclusions can be reached regarding its therapeutic utility. This candidate should be prioritized for further research with an eye towards combination strategies that may address the multifactorial nature of dry AMD pathology (Fabiani et al., 2017; Marneros, 2023; Mendiola & Cardona, 2018).

Trodusquemine (MSI-1436),"Proposal for Trodusquemine (MSI-1436)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Trodusquemine (also known as MSI-1436) is a synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor originally discovered for its ability to inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) through an allosteric mechanism. As an inhibitor with an IC50 in the low micromolar range (~0.3 μM in hepatocytes), it belongs to a class of compounds designed to modulate intracellular signaling cascades by preventing dephosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases. Trodusquemine is chemically distinct from competitive inhibitors because it binds allosterically, thereby modulating the conformational state and activity of PTP1B. It was initially characterized in metabolic and oncologic contexts, with early discovery and synthesis driven by efforts to find agents that could enhance receptor tyrosine kinase signaling by preventing the counteracting effects of PTP1B. This class of compounds has been used in experimental models to enhance insulin receptor signaling and to modulate other growth-factor receptor pathways. (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Stanford & Bottini, 2017)

Therapeutic History:
Trodusquemine has been evaluated in several clinical trials primarily for metabolic and oncologic indications. For example, early-phase clinical studies have examined its safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in overweight or obese subjects with type 2 diabetes (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007, 2008). Additionally, its use in a dose escalation study in metastatic breast cancer patients has provided initial human safety and pharmacokinetic data (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Although these trials did not target ocular diseases, they established fundamental aspects of systemic exposure and safety. There is also evidence from preclinical studies, including rodent safety studies, indicating low ocular toxicity and the potential for retinal exposure based on systemic pharmacokinetic data. While Trodusquemine has been primarily evaluated in non-ocular contexts, there is emerging mechanistic data in in vitro systems that indicate its relevance for retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) biology. Notably, in an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE monolayer with MerTK knockdown, treatment with trodusquemine increased MerTK phosphorylation on tyrosine residue 749 by approximately two‐fold and enhanced the uptake of FITC-conjugated photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by 45%. Although the published clinical data to date do not include dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) endpoints, these preclinical observations suggest translational potential in a disease that is characterized by impaired RPE phagocytosis. (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016)

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, trodusquemine acts by binding allosterically to PTP1B. Under normal physiological conditions, PTP1B dephosphorylates various receptor tyrosine kinases, including the MerTK receptor found on RPE cells. MerTK phosphorylation is critical for initiating phagocytosis of POS by RPE cells, a process essential for maintaining retinal homeostasis. In the retina, MerTK is activated by its ligand Gas6, leading to phosphorylation events that trigger the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and the internalization of shed photoreceptor debris. However, PTP1B acts as a negative regulator by dephosphorylating MerTK, thereby terminating the phagocytic signal. By inhibiting PTP1B, trodusquemine prevents this dephosphorylation, allowing sustained MerTK activation. This enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation state eventually translates into increased uptake of FITC-conjugated POS in in vitro studies using RPE cells, as demonstrable by quantitative assays. Data from baseline studies in hepatocytes support the notion that PTP1B inhibition can sustain receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, and similar biochemical dynamics seem to be present in RPE cells (Basavarajappa et al., 2012; Stanford & Bottini, 2017). The molecular cascade following sustained MerTK activation involves downstream effectors of phagocytic signaling, including pathways that modulate cytoskeletal reorganization and endocytic processing, which are essential for the clearance of POS. (Basavarajappa et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2015)

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis under development is that by inhibiting PTP1B, trodusquemine will prevent the dephosphorylation of MerTK on RPE cells, thereby sustaining its activated state. This sustained phosphorylation is expected to enhance the internalization and phagocytosis of POS. In dry AMD, defective RPE phagocytosis has been implicated in disease pathogenesis, leading to the accumulation of cellular debris, subsequent RPE stress, and eventual photoreceptor degeneration. The expected effect of trodusquemine, therefore, is twofold. First, at the molecular level, it should increase MerTK Y749 phosphorylation, a modification critical for phagocytic function, as observed in preliminary iPSC-derived RPE experiments. Second, this increase in receptor activation should correlate with an enhancement of FITC-POS uptake by RPE cells, improving their ability to clear photoreceptor debris. Evidence shows that such a modulation of MerTK activity may have downstream benefits in maintaining retinal homeostasis, reducing inflammation, and possibly delaying the progression of dry AMD. The rationale for this approach is supported by the established role of MerTK in RPE cell function and clearance mechanisms (Lieffrig et al., 2023; Ghosh et al., 2024). As MerTK signaling is a genetically and functionally validated pathway in RPE phagocytosis, the use of trodusquemine as a pharmacologic agent to sustain this signaling represents a targeted, mechanism-specific intervention for dry AMD. (Fei et al., 2024; Lieffrig et al., 2023)

Overall Evaluation:
Trodusquemine represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD due to its novel mechanism of enhancing MerTK signaling by inhibition of PTP1B. One of the main strengths of this approach is the direct targeting of a key regulatory pathway in RPE cell phagocytosis. Dry AMD currently lacks effective treatments that modulate the fundamental biological process of POS clearance, and by selectively sustaining MerTK phosphorylation, trodusquemine offers a unique mechanism to restore or enhance this essential function. The preclinical data indicating that trodusquemine can increase MerTK Y749 phosphorylation by approximately two-fold and enhance POS uptake by up to 45% in iPSC-derived RPE cells are significant. These findings suggest a direct link between PTP1B inhibition and functional benefits in RPE cells, providing a strong rationale for testing this candidate in models of dry AMD. Furthermore, the fact that systemic pharmacokinetic data demonstrate sufficient retinal exposure and rodent studies indicate low ocular toxicity adds to the overall appeal and feasibility of further development in this indication. (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007, 2008; Fei et al., 2024)

On the other hand, there are several weaknesses and areas that require further validation. While trodusquemine has been well studied in metabolic diseases and oncology, its application in ocular tissues and specifically in RPE cells remains less well documented in published literature. The available clinical trial data have predominantly focused on systemic endpoints rather than ocular pharmacodynamics or retinal efficacy. There remains a need for more comprehensive in vivo studies in rodent models of dry AMD to confirm that the increases in MerTK phosphorylation observed in vitro translate into meaningful improvements in photoreceptor preservation and overall retinal function. Additionally, while the mechanism of PTP1B inhibition is biologically plausible, there is limited published evidence on the potential off-target effects in the retina or the long-term impact of sustained MerTK activation on retinal homeostasis. The possibility of unanticipated adverse effects from prolonged modulation of this pathway should be carefully assessed in preclinical toxicology studies. (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Lieffrig et al., 2023; Mao & Finnemann, 2021)

Another potential challenge is the strategy for drug delivery. Given that trodusquemine has systemic pharmacokinetic data supportive of retinal exposure, it is crucial to determine whether local ocular delivery could achieve higher and more targeted concentrations in the RPE with reduced systemic exposure. This delivery modality might be required to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing potential systemic side effects. Additionally, while the molecular rationale is based on modulating MerTK activity, the complexity of PTP1B’s role in other signaling pathways, such as insulin receptor (IR) signaling in the retina as described in prior reviews, demands careful evaluation to ensure that modulation of PTP1B does not disrupt other vital processes in the retina. Therefore, achieving the correct balance of therapeutic effect while avoiding deleterious downstream effects is a critical challenge in further development. (Basavarajappa et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2015)

In summary, trodusquemine’s novel mechanism of sustaining MerTK receptor activation by inhibiting PTP1B presents a compelling strategy for addressing the critical deficit in POS clearance observed in dry AMD. Its potential to enhance RPE phagocytosis directly addresses a fundamental aspect of AMD pathobiology that is not targeted by current anti-VEGF therapies, which are primarily effective in neovascular (wet) AMD (Shen et al., 2014). However, the translational path forward will require further robust preclinical studies specifically in ocular models, rigorous evaluation of ocular safety and pharmacokinetics, and a careful assessment of any off-target effects that might arise from chronic PTP1B inhibition in the retina. If these challenges can be addressed, trodusquemine could represent an innovative, mechanism-based therapeutic approach for patients suffering from dry AMD, for which there is a significant unmet clinical need. (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Fei et al., 2024; Lieffrig et al., 2023)

Overall, while the preclinical findings are encouraging and the rationale is scientifically robust, further detailed studies are essential to validate the efficacy and safety of trodusquemine for dry AMD. This includes in vivo efficacy studies in dry AMD models, detailed ocular pharmacokinetic assessments, and comprehensive molecular analyses to confirm the sustained activation of MerTK and the downstream enhancement of RPE phagocytosis. The direction for the research team should therefore include prioritizing these studies, potentially exploring localized delivery methods, and establishing a clear translational roadmap that leverages the compound’s known systemic safety profile while addressing the unique challenges of treating a chronic ocular disease such as dry AMD.

Sulforaphane (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# S4441),"Proposal for Sulforaphane (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# S4441)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate that was originally discovered in cruciferous vegetables—most notably broccoli—and has since been isolated, characterized, and made available commercially (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# S4441). It belongs to a class of phytochemicals that are known for their potent antioxidant properties. These bioactive compounds have been traditionally recognized as chemopreventive agents due to their ability to induce the expression of cytoprotective enzymes via modulation of cellular signaling pathways. Sulforaphane is synthesized naturally from glucosinolates present in cruciferous vegetables through the enzymatic action of myrosinase, and its biological activity has been validated in numerous preclinical studies. Historically, compounds of this class have been utilized in dietary interventions and nutraceutical formulations for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits, particularly in the prevention of cancer and in the attenuation of chronic degenerative processes associated with oxidative stress (Hernández-Rabaza, López-Pedrajas, & Almansa, 2019; Yang et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Over the past few decades, sulforaphane has been extensively studied in both in vitro and in vivo models. Early work demonstrated its capacity to induce phase II detoxification enzymes in hepatic and non-hepatic tissues, laying the groundwork for its classification as an indirect antioxidant. In retinal systems, numerous preclinical studies have investigated sulforaphane’s effects on retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, specifically using ARPE-19 as a model system. These studies have shown that sulforaphane can mitigate oxidative stress–induced damage by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, upregulating critical antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM), and thereby reducing the accumulation of oxidative byproducts like lipofuscin (Boulton, 2022; Yang et al., 2021). Although no clinical trials have been reported specifically for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or retinal conditions according to recent clinical trial searches (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), the biochemical literature and animal studies have consistently demonstrated promising cytoprotective properties of sulforaphane in retinal tissue models. In addition, rodent models subjected to retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury have shown that sulforaphane pre-treatment preserves retinal structure and function by activating NRF2-mediated antioxidant pathways (Pan et al., 2014). This history of use in various models of oxidative stress–induced retinal degeneration underpins the rationale for repurposing sulforaphane as a potential drug candidate for dry AMD.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, sulforaphane’s primary mechanism of action is through the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling pathway. Under basal conditions, NRF2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which targets NRF2 for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Sulforaphane, being an electrophilic molecule, covalently modifies critical cysteine residues on KEAP1. This modification disrupts the KEAP1–NRF2 interaction, thereby preventing NRF2 degradation. As a consequence, NRF2 stabilizes, accumulates, and translocates to the nucleus where it dimerizes with small Maf proteins and binds antioxidant response elements (ARE) located within the promoter regions of its target genes (Chen, Zhao, Sternberg, & Cai, 2012; Chang, Lin, Yang, & Yang, 2020).

Once activated, NRF2 upregulates the transcription of a battery of phase II detoxification enzymes and antioxidant proteins, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM). HO-1 catalyzes the degradation of heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and free iron, a process that has both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory implications. NQO1 acts to reduce quinones, preventing redox cycling and subsequent ROS generation, while GCLM is essential for the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), the major intracellular antioxidant that plays a pivotal role in detoxifying ROS (Boulton, 2022; Catanzaro et al., 2020; Cui et al., 2020). In ARPE-19 cells, sulforaphane has been repeatedly shown to stimulate NRF2 nuclear translocation and enhance the expression of these critical enzymes, resulting in a robust antioxidant response that attenuates oxidative stress.

Beyond the upregulation of antioxidant defenses, sulforaphane is suggested to preserve lysosomal enzymatic activity and maintain cellular proteostasis. By mitigating oxidative damage, it is believed that sulforaphane indirectly supports lysosomal integrity, which is crucial for the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by RPE cells. Efficient lysosomal function is necessary for the clearance of cellular debris and for preventing the accumulation of lipofuscin, a pigment that accumulates with age and is associated with dry AMD. Moreover, proper lysosomal function is essential for the Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK)–mediated phagocytosis process, responsible for the ingestion and degradation of POS. Although direct evidence linking sulforaphane to increased MerTK-mediated phagocytosis is sparse, the indirect support stemming from enhanced antioxidant capacity and lysosomal preservation offers a plausible mechanism by which sulforaphane could restore phagocytic function in RPE cells (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
Based on the extensive biochemical and in vivo data, the expected effect of sulforaphane on RPE cells is multifaceted. First, sulforaphane will activate NRF2 via covalent modification of KEAP1. This activation will lead to the upregulation of phase II detoxification enzymes, particularly HO-1, NQO1, and GCLM, in ARPE-19 cells, which have been well characterized in several studies (Boulton, 2022; Yang et al., 2021). As these enzymes increase the cellular antioxidant capacity, a reduction in ROS levels and a concomitant decrease in lipofuscin formation are expected. In the context of dry AMD, where oxidative stress and lipofuscin accumulation drive RPE dysfunction and degeneration, these effects are therapeutically desirable. Second, improved redox homeostasis is anticipated to preserve lysosomal enzymatic activity. While lysosomal preservation has been indirectly linked to NRF2 activation through improved antioxidant defenses, the reduction of oxidative damage to lysosomal membranes should, in theory, enhance the ability of RPE cells to degrade phagocytosed photoreceptor outer segments (Pan et al., 2014; Catanzaro et al., 2020). This preservation of lysosomal function is critical because it is a prerequisite for efficient MerTK-mediated phagocytosis, a receptor-mediated process by which RPE cells clear shed photoreceptor outer segments. Although direct measurements of MerTK-mediated ingestion under sulforaphane treatment are limited, the overall increase in cellular detoxification and antioxidant defense provides a strong mechanistic basis for expecting restoration or improvement in this phagocytic process (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Cui et al., 2020).

In an assay using ARPE-19 cells, for example, we would expect sulforaphane treatment to lead to measurable increases in the expression levels of HO-1, NQO1, and GCLM mRNA and protein. Concomitantly, assays measuring intracellular ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential, and markers of lipid peroxidation should show significant improvement relative to controls exposed to oxidative stress alone. In functional assays, preservation of lysosomal enzyme activities should correlate with enhanced clearance of POS-like substrates by RPE cells, potentially demonstrable by increased uptake and degradation in a MerTK-dependent assay (Yang et al., 2021; Hernández-Rabaza et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
Sulforaphane represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD, owing to its well-documented mechanism of activating the NRF2 pathway, which is crucial for elevating endogenous antioxidant defenses. Strengths of sulforaphane include its natural origin, which confers a generally favorable safety profile, and its potent biochemical activity in upregulating phase II detoxification enzymes. The literature provides robust evidence for its ability to reduce oxidative stress, enhance mitochondrial and cellular redox homeostasis, and potentially preserve lysosomal function in RPE cells (Boulton, 2022; Catanzaro et al., 2020). These effects are directly relevant to the pathogenesis of dry AMD, where oxidative damage leads to RPE dysfunction, lipofuscin accumulation, and impaired phagocytosis. Moreover, the therapeutic hypothesis that sulforaphane can secondarily restore MerTK-mediated phagocytosis by maintaining lysosomal integrity presents an attractive strategy to counteract the accumulation of photoreceptor debris—a key feature of dry AMD pathology (Pan et al., 2014; Canto et al., 2022).

However, some weaknesses must also be considered. Although in vitro and animal studies consistently demonstrate sulforaphane’s NRF2 activation and antioxidant effects, there is a lack of direct clinical data or human trials targeting AMD specifically (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, while the preservation of lysosomal function and improvement in MerTK-mediated phagocytosis are mechanistically plausible, the evidence for these effects remains largely indirect. Further research, particularly translational studies, is needed to clearly define the impact of sulforaphane on lysosomal enzyme activity and phagocytic capacity in the context of dry AMD (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Cui et al., 2020). Moreover, formulation and delivery remain key challenges for ocular drugs; however, recent data suggesting that topical delivery can yield therapeutic ocular levels of sulforaphane are encouraging (Bergandi et al., 2024).

In summary, the overall evaluation of sulforaphane is positive. Its strengths—rooted in a well-characterized mechanism of NRF2 activation, induction of endogenous detoxifying enzymes, reduction in oxidative stress, and potential to restore critical RPE functions—support its further investigation as a repurposed drug candidate for dry AMD. Weaknesses such as the need for more direct evidence on lysosomal preservation and MerTK-mediated phagocytosis, as well as the absence of clinical trial data specific to AMD, suggest that additional preclinical studies are warranted. Nonetheless, given its broad cytoprotective effects and minimal known toxicity, sulforaphane remains an attractive candidate that could offer a multifaceted therapeutic approach to mitigating RPE degeneration and counteracting the progression of dry AMD (Hernández-Rabaza et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2023).

Canakinumab (Ilaris),"Proposal for Canakinumab (Ilaris)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Canakinumab, marketed under the trade name Ilaris®, is a fully human monoclonal antibody engineered to target and neutralize interleukin‐1 beta (IL-1β), a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine. Its discovery and synthesis took advantage of advanced recombinant DNA and transgenic mouse (HuMab-Mouse™) technologies, whereby the endogenous immunoglobulin genes of mice were inactivated and replaced with human immunoglobulin sequences to produce fully human antibodies (Dhimolea, 2010; Gram, 2016). The antibody is expressed in mammalian cell lines, such as NS0 or Sp2/0, generating clinical-grade material that meets stringent regulatory requirements, and it belongs to the immunomodulatory biologic class—a group of therapeutics designed to inhibit specific cytokine signaling pathways. Monoclonal antibodies of this class have a rich history in clinical medicine; they have been used to neutralize cytokines in diseases ranging from rheumatoid arthritis and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis to autoinflammatory syndromes like cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). Their targeted approach spares large parts of the immune system, limiting side effects compared to broad spectrum immunosuppressants (Dhimolea, 2010; Dübel & Reichert, 2014).

Therapeutic History:
Canakinumab has undergone an extensive clinical development program across several inflammatory and autoinflammatory diseases that have an underlying IL-1β pathology. It initially demonstrated remarkable efficacy and safety in clinical studies targeting CAPS, including Muckle-Wells syndrome and familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007). In subsequent clinical studies, canakinumab was evaluated for conditions ranging from rheumatoid arthritis to cardiovascular inflammation in patients with a high inflammatory burden (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2005; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2010). These trials established not only the biochemical mechanism of IL-1β neutralization but also the favorable pharmacokinetic properties—namely its long elimination half-life (approximately 26 days) allowing infrequent dosing and robust systemic anti-inflammatory activity (Chakraborty et al., 2012; Dhimolea, 2010). Although its approved indications do not include age-related macular degeneration (AMD) directly, its mechanism has been explored in diseases that share common inflammatory pathways with dry AMD. Several preclinical studies and translational research efforts have underscored the role of IL-1β in ocular inflammation and retinal degeneration, thereby rationalizing the repurposing of canakinumab for dry AMD. Notably, while clinical trials specific to dry AMD are limited at present, the widespread use of canakinumab in systemic inflammatory diseases strongly supports its potential cross-application in ocular conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2010; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, canakinumab exerts its therapeutic effects by binding IL-1β with exceptionally high affinity—in the sub-nanomolar range (approximately 40 pM)—thereby neutralizing its ability to interact with the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R). The crystal structure of the canakinumab/IL-1β complex, as elucidated in several studies, demonstrates that the antibody binds to a discontinuous epitope that is crucial for IL-1β’s biological activity; key residues such as Glu64 form part of this epitope, and binding of canakinumab sterically hinders IL-1β from engaging its receptor (Dhimolea, 2010; Gram, 2016). In doing so, the monoclonal antibody prevents the recruitment of the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) and subsequent activation of downstream signaling cascades, such as NF-κB and MAPK pathways, which are responsible for inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-α. This targeted blockade of IL-1β interrupts the autocrine and paracrine cycles of inflammation that are driven by inflammasome activation. In many inflammatory diseases, chronic deregulation of IL-1β production leads to tissue damage; therefore, by blocking this central pro-inflammatory mediator, canakinumab modulates the immune response and attenuates inflammation. In the context of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, such neutralization is critically important, as IL-1β overactivity has been associated with decreased expression of phagocytic receptors like MerTK and integrins, thereby impeding the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) and contributing to the progression of dry AMD (Brandstetter, 2016; Fabiani et al., 2017).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis in our proposal is that by neutralizing IL-1β in the subretinal microenvironment, canakinumab will reduce both local and systemic inflammation that contributes to the pathogenesis of dry AMD. Elevated IL-1β levels in the vitreous fluid of AMD patients and in RPE cell cultures have been correlated with downregulated expression of key phagocytic receptors such as MerTK. With IL-1β being a central mediator of this chronic inflammatory state, canakinumab’s potent neutralization is expected to lead to the following in vitro and, eventually, in vivo effects: (1) a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, exemplified by reported reductions in IL-6 and TNF-α levels that approach 75% at a concentration of 100 ng/mL in RPE assays, (2) preservation and possibly restoration of MerTK expression on RPE cells, and (3) an increased uptake of FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segments (an observed increase of 33%)—all of which contribute to the restoration of effective phagocytosis of shed POS (Fabiani et al., 2017; Campbell & Doyle, 2013). In addition to these cellular effects, neutralization of IL-1β also interrupts the pro-inflammatory signaling cascade that is known to amplify retinal degeneration through chronic inflammasome activation (Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Brandstetter, 2016). Because RPE cells rely on MerTK-mediated phagocytosis for their normal turnover of POS—a function that is imperative for retinal homeostasis—the preservation of receptor expression and function under inflammatory stress is a key therapeutic target. In RPE assays, by preventing IL-1β from binding its receptor, canakinumab is expected not only to reduce the secretion of harmful cytokines but also to allow cellular repair mechanisms to re‐establish proper phagocytic function. This effect is particularly pertinent given evidence that IL-1β inhibition positively modulates integrin signaling and MerTK-associated pathways, ultimately leading to improved clearance of debris that accumulates in the subretinal space—a critical therapeutic goal in dry AMD (Dhimolea, 2010; Fabiani et al., 2017; Campbell & Doyle, 2013).

Overall Evaluation:
The use of canakinumab as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is supported by a robust biochemical rationale, a well-defined mechanism of action, and extensive clinical experience in other IL-1β-mediated inflammatory diseases. One of the major strengths of canakinumab is its high specificity and sub-nanomolar affinity for IL-1β, which ensures that even low levels of the cytokine are effectively neutralized. This precision, derived from its thoroughly characterized binding epitope and validated through ligand–receptor interaction studies (Dhimolea, 2010; Chakraborty et al., 2012), allows canakinumab to mitigate chronic inflammatory signaling without broadly suppressing the immune system. Moreover, the favorable systemic safety profile observed in large-scale clinical trials for conditions such as CAPS, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and cardiovascular inflammation lends considerable support to its translational feasibility for ocular applications. Importantly, studies have shown that canakinumab administration is associated with reduced levels of IL-6 and TNF-α and preserves critical phagocytic receptors in RPE cell assays, translating into a measurable improvement in the uptake of photoreceptor outer segments—a key functional marker in dry AMD (Fabiani et al., 2017; Campbell & Doyle, 2013).

Nevertheless, several challenges and weaknesses must be acknowledged. First, while the preclinical and biochemical data strongly support an IL-1β-driven mechanism in AMD, there is currently a scarcity of clinical trial data directly related to dry AMD. Most of the existing trials of canakinumab (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011) have focused on systemic inflammatory and autoinflammatory conditions rather than ocular diseases. Thus, extrapolating the systemic safety and efficacy profile to the retinal context, although promising, remains speculative until direct ophthalmologic studies are conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011). Second, effective drug delivery remains a significant concern. The subretinal microenvironment has barriers that may limit the penetration and local concentration of systemically administered monoclonal antibodies. Although systemic dosing has a proven safety record, achieving therapeutic levels in the eye may require alternative administration strategies—such as intravitreal injection—which present their own set of challenges in terms of dosing frequency, potential local side effects, and patient acceptance (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Third, while in vitro assays confirm that canakinumab at 100 ng/mL significantly reduces inflammatory cytokine secretion and improves phagocytosis in RPE cells, the in vivo translation of these effects remains to be carefully validated in animal models of dry AMD before clinical application in humans can be confidently recommended (Fabiani et al., 2017; Campbell & Doyle, 2013). Finally, since the underlying pathogenic mechanisms in dry AMD are multifactorial, incorporating oxidative stress, complement dysregulation, and chronic low-grade inflammation, targeting IL-1β alone may not be sufficient to fully restore RPE function or halt disease progression. Combination therapy approaches, potentially integrating IL-1β inhibition with antioxidants or agents targeting the complement pathway, may be required to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes (Brandstetter, 2016; Campbell & Doyle, 2013).

In conclusion, canakinumab emerges as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD based on its established role in neutralizing IL-1β, its documented efficacy in reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and preserving phagocytic receptor expression in preclinical RPE cell assays, and its overall favorable safety profile in systemic inflammatory diseases. However, further studies are essential to determine the appropriate delivery methods to achieve effective retinal concentrations and to validate its therapeutic benefits in relevant animal models before proceeding to targeted clinical trials in dry AMD patients. The mechanistic and biochemical rationale is strong, yet clinical proof-of-concept in the ocular setting remains an unmet need. Therefore, the next steps should include rigorous preclinical evaluation in AMD models, coupled with pharmacokinetic assessments aimed at optimizing ocular bioavailability, followed by carefully designed early-phase clinical trials to evaluate efficacy, safety, and appropriate dosing in the context of dry AMD. With these considerations in mind, canakinumab represents a rational and innovative approach to modulating the chronic inflammatory barrier in dry AMD by restoring MerTK- and integrin-mediated phagocytosis through selective IL-1β blockade (Dhimolea, 2010; Fabiani et al., 2017; Campbell & Doyle, 2013).

AZ10606120 (P2X7 receptor antagonist; Tocris Cat# 2528),"Proposal for AZ10606120 (P2X7 receptor antagonist; Tocris Cat# 2528)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
AZ10606120 is a synthetic small‐molecule antagonist that selectively targets the P2X7 receptor, a member of the ATP-gated ion channel family expressed in a variety of tissues including the retina. This compound was discovered and developed through extensive medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at improving receptor specificity, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetic properties relative to earlier P2X7 inhibitors. Although detailed synthesis routes are not explicitly provided in the available literature excerpts, AZ10606120 is representative of a class of cyanoguanidine derivatives that have evolved from first-generation compounds (oATP, suramin) to more refined agents with enhanced potency. It is a member of the class of P2X7 receptor antagonists that have been utilized primarily in preclinical models for neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Multiple studies have documented the utility of this class in modulating ATP-mediated inflammatory signaling, and AZ10606120 in particular is known to inhibit the receptor at low micromolar concentrations, thereby blocking calcium influx and the downstream cascade of inflammatory events in vitro. Its Tocris catalog number (Cat# 2528) denotes its availability as a research tool, and the class history of P2X7 antagonists has seen use in models of retinal and neurodegenerative cell death (Calzaferri et al., 2020; Gu & Wiley, 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, the use of P2X7 antagonists has been explored in a variety of preclinical settings, including neurological disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and retinal pathologies. In the context of ocular disease, particularly age-related macular degeneration (AMD), there is a growing body of evidence implicating the P2X7 receptor in mediating retinal inflammation, inflammasome activation, and subsequent cell death in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Although direct clinical trials with AZ10606120 in AMD have not yet been reported, in vivo rodent studies and cell culture experiments using similar compounds have demonstrated that blockade of P2X7 can reduce ATP-induced IL-1β secretion, protect against retinal ganglion cell death, and ameliorate photoreceptor damage (Youn, 2024; Sekar et al., 2023). The candidate’s use in intravitreal applications in animal models has shown promising retinal protection, suggesting that such P2X7 inhibitors may indeed translate into therapeutic strategies for dry AMD. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that P2X7 receptor activation in the retina is involved in deleterious processes such as oxidative stress-induced inflammasome activation and lysosomal dysfunction in RPE cells, positioning P2X7 antagonism as a novel approach for diseases characterized by chronic inflammation and accumulation of cellular debris (Li & Wang, 2025; Molcak et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
The P2X7 receptor is a trimeric, ATP-gated nonselective cation channel that, when activated by extracellular ATP at high concentrations (typically in the 0.1–1 mM range), permits the influx of calcium and other cations, initiating multiple downstream signaling cascades. Its activation triggers the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that cleaves pro-caspase-1 into its active form. Active caspase-1 subsequently processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature, secreted cytokine forms, thereby amplifying the inflammatory response (Wright & Ambati, 2017; Yang, 2017). AZ10606120 functions by selectively binding to the P2X7 receptor and preventing ATP from engaging the channel. This inhibition effectively blocks the ion flux that would normally lead to the formation of large pores in the membrane and prevents the subsequent activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In RPE cells, where ATP levels can be elevated under oxidative stress conditions, the compound’s blockade of P2X7 receptor activity is thought to stabilize lysosomal membranes, mitigate aberrant calcium influx, and reduce the initiation of proinflammatory signaling cascades (Youn, 2024; Dutot et al., 2017). Additionally, P2X7 receptor antagonism has been linked to improved autophagic flux and phagocytic clearance of cellular debris, a process critical for the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) via MerTK-dependent mechanisms. By preserving autophagic and phagocytic functions, AZ10606120 might maintain RPE homeostasis, thus preventing the buildup of toxic waste products that contribute to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Li & Wang, 2025; Youn, 2024).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay focusing on RPE cells under oxidative stress, the expected effect of AZ10606120 is multifold. First, by antagonizing the P2X7 receptor, the compound is anticipated to block extracellular ATP’s role as the second signal necessary for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This blockade should lead to a significant reduction in caspase-1 activation and subsequent secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β. Given that IL-1β release is a key mediator of RPE cell inflammation and degeneration in dry AMD, the compound is expected to reduce inflammatory burden within the retina (Youn, 2024; Yang, 2017). Second, by stabilizing intracellular calcium levels and preserving lysosomal membrane integrity, AZ10606120 should help maintain normal autophagic processes in RPE cells. Enhanced autophagy facilitates the proper degradation and recycling of damaged cellular components, including the clearance of POS via MerTK signaling. This improvement in phagocytic function is crucial for retinal homeostasis because impaired phagocytosis by the RPE is a well-documented feature in dry AMD (Calzaferri et al., 2020; Li & Wang, 2025). Third, by mitigating ATP-mediated oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling, the overall cellular stress in the RPE should be reduced, thus preserving cell viability and function. The targeting of upstream inflammasome triggers by AZ10606120 offers the potential for a more precise intervention, ultimately preserving retinal structure and function and slowing the progression of dry AMD (Déchelle, 2024; Gu & Wiley, 2018).

Overall Evaluation:
The therapeutic candidate AZ10606120 exhibits several strengths that render it a promising agent for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration. Its selective antagonism of the P2X7 receptor is mechanistically appealing because it targets a well-defined upstream trigger—extracellular ATP-mediated activation—that is known to contribute substantially to inflammasome activation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cell death in the retinal pigment epithelium. The preclinical evidence suggests that P2X7 blockade can attenuate IL-1β release, preserve lysosomal integrity, and support normal autophagic and phagocytic functions in RPE cells, thereby maintaining retinal homeostasis (Youn, 2024; Li & Wang, 2025). The compound’s ability to modulate these pathways at an early, upstream stage is a distinct advantage over therapies that target downstream inflammatory mediators.

Despite these strengths, several weaknesses or uncertainties remain. First, while preclinical studies in rodent models and in vitro RPE cultures provide encouraging data, there is limited direct clinical trial evidence to confirm the efficacy and safety of AZ10606120 in human subjects with dry AMD. The literature indicates that although P2X7 antagonism has successfully reduced retinal inflammation and cell death in animal models, translation to clinical efficacy in retinal degenerative diseases remains elusive and requires further investigation (Wright & Ambati, 2017; Youn, 2024). Second, although the mechanistic basis for improved autophagy and phagocytosis is supported by studies on P2X7 receptor function in the RPE, detailed data demonstrating enhancement of MerTK-mediated POS clearance specifically by AZ10606120 have not been conclusively reported. This means that while the hypothesis is strong, the precise downstream effects on autophagy and phagocytosis require additional mechanistic studies (Li & Wang, 2025; Youn, 2024). Third, the compound’s pharmacokinetic profile, optimal dosing, and long-term safety in ocular applications still need thorough characterization. Ocular delivery poses unique challenges, particularly with regard to achieving sufficient intraocular concentrations and avoiding off-target effects or cytotoxicity in retinal tissues (Molcak et al., 2023; Sekar et al., 2023).

In summary, AZ10606120 represents a compelling candidate for dry AMD therapy through its selective inhibition of the P2X7 receptor, thereby interfering with ATP-mediated inflammasome activation that drives IL-1β release and RPE degeneration. Its proposed mechanism of preserving lysosomal integrity and enhancing autophagy and phagocytic clearance addresses key pathogenic pathways in dry AMD. Strengths include its upstream targeting of the inflammatory cascade and the supportive preclinical evidence in relevant retinal models. Weaknesses center on the need for more extensive clinical data on its efficacy and safety, as well as detailed investigations into its effects on autophagy, phagocytosis, and MerTK signaling specifically in the context of AMD. Overall, the candidate has sound mechanistic rationale and promising preclinical evidence to warrant further translational studies and eventual clinical evaluation in dry AMD (Youn, 2024; Calzaferri et al., 2020; Dutot et al., 2017).

Emixustat hydrochloride (ACU-4429),"Proposal for Emixustat hydrochloride (ACU-4429)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Emixustat hydrochloride (ACU-4429) is a small‐molecule, non‐retinoid compound originally developed by Acucela Inc. that functions as a visual cycle modulator by selectively inhibiting the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)–specific isomerase, RPE65. Its chemical synthesis involves the design of a molecule that mimics the transition state of the RPE65-catalyzed reaction, allowing it to bind with high affinity (IC50 approximately 4.4 nM) to the enzyme’s retinoid binding site via its critical hydroxyl moiety (Unknown Reference, 2022; Jack et al., 2016). Emixustat belongs to the class of visual cycle modulators, a group of therapeutic compounds designed to regulate the flow of retinoids through the visual cycle by targeting enzymes such as RPE65. Historically, compounds within this class have been investigated to address retinal degenerative diseases by modulating toxic byproduct accumulation, with earlier agents, such as retinylamine analogues, demonstrating the potential to reduce bisretinoid formation (Unknown Reference, 2022; Jack et al., 2016). The molecule is available commercially from suppliers such as Sigma (catalog E1047), and its oral bioavailability, along with well‐described pharmacokinetic properties, makes it an attractive candidate for repurposing in diseases where chronic dosing is required, such as dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) (Basha & Nagipogu, 2023; Kubota et al., 2014).

Therapeutic History:
Emixustat has undergone extensive preclinical evaluation and several early‐phase clinical trials in the context of retinal degeneration, particularly targeting dry AMD and its advanced form, geographic atrophy (GA). Preclinical studies in animal models, including Abca4–/– mice that mimic aspects of Stargardt disease and dry AMD, have shown that inhibition of RPE65 with emixustat leads to reduced accumulation of lipofuscin and toxic bisretinoids such as A2E, thereby improving the efficiency of phagolysosomal clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (Unknown Reference, 2022; Pinilla et al., 2022). In early‐phase clinical trials, such as the Phase 1 dose‐ranging study conducted in healthy volunteers, emixustat demonstrated predictable pharmacokinetics, with a rapid absorption profile, a half‐life in the range of approximately 4.6 to 7.9 hours, and dose‐proportional increases in systemic exposure without significant accumulation upon repeated dosing (Kubota et al., 2014). Further clinical evaluation has been undertaken across several trials targeting dry AMD and GA. Notably, the Phase 2 trial referenced by Dugel et al. provided proof‐of‐concept data demonstrating a dose‐dependent, reversible suppression of rod photoreceptor function (as measured by electroretinography, ERG), which is reflective of the intended pharmacodynamic effect of visual cycle inhibition (Dugel et al., 2015). However, it is equally important to recognize that subsequent larger Phase 2/3 randomized controlled trials, such as the SEATTLE study (NCT01802866) failed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in the growth rate of GA lesions, despite the mechanistic rationale supporting the inhibition of toxic bisretinoid accumulation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yeong et al., 2020). In addition, emixustat has been studied in other related retinal pathologies such as Stargardt disease, where some insights regarding its pharmacodynamics and safety profile have been confirmed, although the ultimate clinical benefit remains under intense investigation (NCT03772665; Fabre, 2021). Collectively, the historical data suggest that while the biochemical and preclinical foundations are robust, the translation of such effects into clinically meaningful outcomes in dry AMD has proven challenging (Hussain et al., 2018; Dugel et al., 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
Emixustat hydrochloride acts by directly inhibiting the isomerase enzyme RPE65, which is expressed exclusively in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and is essential for the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal from all-trans-retinyl esters. The RPE65 enzyme catalyzes a crucial rate‐limiting step in the visual cycle: the isomerization reaction that converts all-trans-retinyl ester to 11-cis-retinol, the precursor of the visual chromophore 11-cis-retinal necessary for phototransduction (Jack et al., 2016; Kubota et al., 2020). By reversibly inhibiting RPE65, emixustat slows the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal and limits the continuous recycling of retinoids. This deceleration has the downstream effect of reducing the availability of all-trans-retinal, which, under high metabolic demand, can condense to form toxic bisretinoid compounds such as A2E. A2E is known to accumulate as lipofuscin within the lysosomal compartments of RPE cells, interfering with normal lysosomal hydrolase function and compromising the phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments (Hussain et al., 2018; Unknown Reference, 2021). Cervically, structural studies have provided insight into how emixustat’s hydroxyl group binds the retinoid binding pocket of RPE65, mimicking the transition state of the enzyme reaction and resulting in potent competitive inhibition (Unknown Reference, 2022; Jack et al., 2016). In vitro and in vivo experimental systems have demonstrated that such inhibition is dose‐dependent, with higher doses resulting in greater suppression of visual cycle activity as observed in rod ERG b‐wave amplitude reductions, which are reversible upon cessation of treatment (Dugel et al., 2015; Kubota et al., 2014). Importantly, emixustat’s action is selective for the RPE65 enzyme, meaning that other components of the visual cycle may remain functionally intact, potentially mitigating broad‐based suppression of vision, although some clinically observed visual disturbances, such as chromatopsia and delayed dark adaptation, occur as on‐target effects (Jack et al., 2016; Kubota et al., 2020). At the molecular level, this mechanism successfully links the pharmacological inhibition of RPE65 to a reduction in downstream formation of A2E and other cytotoxic bisretinoids—compounds that have been implicated in the interference with lysosomal enzyme activity and consequent RPE dysfunction that underpin the pathobiology of dry AMD (Hussain et al., 2018; Yeong et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the use of emixustat in the treatment of dry AMD is expected to yield several beneficial effects at both the biochemical and cellular levels. First, by slowing the visual cycle through RPE65 inhibition, emixustat reduces the production of all-trans-retinal, thereby lowering the formation of A2E and subsequent lipofuscin accumulation in RPE lysosomes—a process that is central to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Unknown Reference, 2022; Hussain et al., 2018). Preclinical experiments in animal models, particularly those deficient in the ABCA4 gene, have shown that treatment with emixustat results in lower lipofuscin fluorescence and enhanced clearance of photoreceptor outer segments by the RPE, thereby diminishing cellular stress and oxidative damage (Bassetto et al., 2023; Dugel et al., 2015). In the proposed assays and models, RPE cells expressing RPE65 would exhibit normalized phagocytic flux, with reduced lysosomal dysfunction resulting from lower levels of toxic bisretinoids. In vivo, this is anticipated to translate into a slower progression of GA lesions, as measured by fundus autofluorescence and color fundus photography, and potentially stabilization or even modest improvement in visual acuity over time (Dugel et al., 2015; Yeong et al., 2020). Furthermore, clinical data from Phase 2 studies in patients with GA have indicated that while emixustat is associated with significant ocular adverse effects related to its mechanism (e.g., delayed dark adaptation and chromatopsia), there have been trends toward a reduction in lesion growth rates, suggesting that RPE cell homeostasis may be partially restored (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Dugel et al., 2015; Yeong et al., 2020). Given that RPE65 is highly expressed in the RPE of aged human retinas, the hypothesis is that emixustat will decrease the formation of A2E and similar compounds, which in turn will restore the efficiency of lysosomal degradation processes, leading to improved outer segment turnover and photoreceptor survival (Wright & Ambati, 2017; Pinilla et al., 2022). Ultimately, the expected benefit is a slowing of the degenerative process characteristic of dry AMD, potentially preserving central vision and delaying the onset of severe visual impairment.

Overall Evaluation:
Emixustat hydrochloride presents a strong mechanistic rationale and is supported by comprehensive preclinical data, making it an attractive candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD. Its strengths include a clearly defined molecular target—RPE65—and a well‐characterized biochemical pathway linking RPE65 inhibition to reduced formation of toxic retinoid byproducts (A2E) and, consequently, decreased lipofuscin accumulation (Hussain et al., 2018; Jack et al., 2016). The compound’s oral bioavailability and predictable pharmacokinetics, demonstrated in multiple Phase 1 studies, further support its feasibility as a therapeutic agent requiring chronic administration (Kubota et al., 2014; Kubota et al., 2020). Preclinical studies in genetically modified mouse models have provided promising evidence that emixustat can mitigate retinal degeneration by enhancing RPE clearance of photoreceptor debris and reducing oxidative stress (Unknown Reference, 2022; Dugel et al., 2015).

Nonetheless, several concerns have emerged from the clinical investigations. Although Phase 2 trials have indicated favorable safety profiles and reversible pharmacodynamic effects (e.g., dose‐dependent suppression of rod function measured by ERG), larger clinical trials such as the SEATTLE study (NCT01802866) did not meet their primary efficacy endpoints in terms of slowing GA progression or significantly preserving best‐corrected visual acuity (Yeong et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Ocular adverse events, in particular delayed dark adaptation and chromatopsia, have been common and dose‐dependent, potentially limiting the therapeutic window and patient tolerability (Jack et al., 2016; Kubota et al., 2014). These side effects are a consequence of the same mechanistic inhibition that is intended to reduce A2E accumulation, representing a critical trade‐off between efficacy and safety. Furthermore, while the rationale for reducing A2E formation in the RPE is robust from a biochemical standpoint, clinical outcomes have been mixed; the translation of preclinical benefits into noticeable clinical improvement in patients with advanced dry AMD has proven difficult (Yeong et al., 2020; Dugel et al., 2015).

An additional challenge is the potential disconnect between pharmacodynamic markers (such as ERG b‐wave suppression) and long‐term clinical endpoints like GA lesion progression and visual acuity maintenance (Kubota et al., 2020; Rubner et al., 2022). While the modulation of the visual cycle clearly demonstrates target engagement, it remains uncertain whether these effects are sufficient to counteract the multifactorial pathogenesis of dry AMD, which involves oxidative stress, inflammation, and complex genetic contributors (Wright & Ambati, 2017; Yeong et al., 2020).

Overall, emixustat’s primary strengths lie in its targeted mechanism of action and its capacity for oral administration with a pharmacokinetic profile that enables dose optimization. The molecule’s ability to selectively and reversibly inhibit RPE65 underpins a well‐validated biochemical hypothesis aimed at reducing toxic bisretinoid accumulation and enhancing lysosomal function in the RPE (Unknown Reference, 2021; Hussain et al., 2018). On the other hand, weaknesses include the limited demonstration of clinical efficacy in slowing the progression of GA in large‐scale trials and the occurrence of mechanistically unavoidable ocular adverse events that may impact patient quality of life and adherence (Dugel et al., 2015; Yeong et al., 2020). Given these factors, while emixustat continues to be one of the most thoroughly evaluated candidates in the space of visual cycle modulation for dry AMD, its ultimate clinical utility remains unproven. Moving forward, strategies to mitigate adverse ocular effects or combining emixustat with other therapeutic modalities that address additional pathogenic mechanisms (e.g., complement inhibition, neuroprotection) may be necessary to achieve meaningful clinical benefit in patients with dry AMD (Hussain et al., 2018; Guimaraes et al., 2022).

In summary, the comprehensive literature review indicates that emixustat hydrochloride possesses a strong mechanistic rationale for use in dry AMD based on its ability to inhibit the RPE65 enzyme, thereby reducing the generation of toxic derivatives such as A2E and lipofuscin that contribute to RPE dysfunction and photoreceptor loss (Unknown Reference, 2022; Jack et al., 2016). Preclinical studies support its role in decreasing cellular stress and enhancing lysosomal clearance, while early‐phase clinical studies confirm target engagement and acceptable safety profiles with reversible effects on visual function (Kubota et al., 2014; Dugel et al., 2015). However, the translation of these effects into significant clinical efficacy remains uncertain, as evidenced by large‐scale trials that failed to demonstrate a statistically meaningful reduction in geographic atrophy progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yeong et al., 2020). In light of these findings, emixustat’s strengths—its known mechanism of action, oral bioavailability, and detailed pharmacokinetic profile—are balanced by weaknesses including dose‐dependent ocular side effects and inconsistent clinical efficacy outcomes. Therefore, while emixustat remains a promising candidate based on its mechanistic underpinnings, its overall potential for the treatment of dry AMD may be limited unless further modifications, combination strategies, or optimal patient selection can be achieved to enhance its therapeutic index (Hussain et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2022).

Resveratrol (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# R5010),"Proposal for Resveratrol (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# R5010)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Resveratrol is a naturally occurring stilbene polyphenol originally isolated from the roots of Polygonum cuspidatum and is most famously present in red wine, grape skins, and certain berries. It belongs to a class of naturally derived antioxidant compounds that have been used empirically in traditional Asian medicine for centuries to treat a variety of ailments including inflammation, cardiovascular disorders, and even certain cancers. Its extraction and purification from plant sources have been standardized over the years with commercial availability—for example, Sigma-Aldrich offers resveratrol under Cat# R5010. As a member of the polyphenol family, resveratrol’s chemical structure is characterized by two aromatic rings connected by an ethylene bridge, with the trans-isomer being recognized for its higher biological activity (Bola et al., 2014). This compound is frequently studied not only for its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties but also for its ability to modulate several key intracellular signaling pathways that are implicated in cellular stress responses and aging. The scope of its therapeutic application spans cardiovascular protection, metabolic syndrome amelioration, neuroprotection, and anticancer activity. In the context of ocular pharmacology, resveratrol has garnered substantial interest for its potential role in treating retinal diseases, particularly age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, resveratrol has been explored in a broad spectrum of preclinical and clinical studies that underline its versatility as a therapeutic agent. It has been used in multiple in vitro models and in animal studies focusing on neurodegenerative disorders, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell protection. For instance, numerous studies have demonstrated that resveratrol exerts protective effects against oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity in ARPE-19 cell models, mitigating the effects of toxic compounds such as A2E—a lipofuscin fluorophore that contributes to the pathology of AMD (Alaimo et al., 2020). In retinal research, resveratrol’s role in reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and preserving mitochondrial integrity has been well documented, supporting its candidature for retinal neuroprotection. Furthermore, clinical trials such as NCT02625376 and NCT04756310, although primarily focused on exudative (wet) AMD, have established a precedent for incorporating resveratrol into nutritional and therapeutic regimens for retinal diseases. These studies have underscored the compound’s safety profile and its potential to serve as an adjunct antioxidant therapy in ocular conditions. While its application in treating dry AMD has not been as extensively tested in clinical trials compared to other ocular conditions, the extensive preclinical literature—demonstrating improvements in mitochondrial function, decreased oxidative stress, and enhanced cellular survival in RPE cells—suggests a promising opportunity for repurposing resveratrol for dry AMD (Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021; Bola et al., 2014). Additionally, its role has been validated in various non-ocular contexts such as cardiovascular and metabolic disease models, which provide supporting evidence for its pleiotropic effects across different tissues.

Mechanism of Action:
Resveratrol exerts its protective biological effects through multiple molecular mechanisms that converge on the modulation of intracellular stress responses. One of the primary mechanisms involves the activation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD⁺-dependent deacetylase that regulates cellular metabolism, stress responses, and longevity. Activation of SIRT1 by resveratrol leads to the deacetylation and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), a critical transcription factor for mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism (Delmas et al., 2021; Bola et al., 2014). PGC-1α, once deacetylated, can induce the expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), which are essential for the replication and transcription of mitochondrial DNA. This process promotes enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and function, leading to better ATP production and lower levels of mitochondrial ROS, a key factor implicated in the degeneration of RPE cells in dry AMD.

In addition to its effects on mitochondrial biogenesis, resveratrol is known to upregulate endogenous antioxidative defenses through modulation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. By enhancing the transcription of phase II detoxifying enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase, resveratrol helps to reduce intracellular levels of ROS and lipid peroxidation products (Pop et al., 2022; Bhattarai et al., 2021). Resveratrol also imparts anti-inflammatory effects by attenuating the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), thereby reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). These cytokines play a significant role in propagating chronic inflammation in the retina and contribute to the progression of AMD (Bola et al., 2014; Ballesteros Caldés, 2017).

Furthermore, resveratrol appears to have a role in modulating autophagy, a cellular process that is crucial for clearing damaged organelles and protein aggregates. Although direct evidence for enhanced autophagy or phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by RPE cells mediated by resveratrol is less explicit in the provided literature, several studies indicate that by preserving cytoskeletal and lysosomal function, resveratrol indirectly supports these processes, thus maintaining overall RPE cell homeostasis (Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021; Delmas et al., 2021). Through these combined actions—SIRT1 activation, promotion of PGC-1α activity, enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis, reduction in oxidative stress, and modulation of inflammatory pathways—resveratrol establishes a multifaceted defense against the cellular degeneration seen in dry AMD.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis driving the repurposing of resveratrol for dry AMD is that activation of SIRT1 in RPE cells will lead to PGC-1α deacetylation, thereby promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, upregulating antioxidative defenses, and preserving critical cellular functions such as autophagy and photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagocytosis. In an in vitro assay using RPE cells, the expected outcome is that resveratrol treatment will result in increased expression of PGC-1α target genes—such as TFAM and NRF1—which are essential for mitochondrial replication and function (Delmas et al., 2021). This upregulation should correlate with reduced levels of ROS and lower accumulation of lipofuscin-like deposits, which are hallmarks of RPE cell aging and dry AMD pathology (Alaimo et al., 2020; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021).

Moreover, the activation of SIRT1 is anticipated to enhance the cellular antioxidative network by increasing the activity of enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. This boosted endogenous defense mechanism is expected to protect cells against oxidative DNA damage and prevent mitochondrial fragmentation, thereby maintaining cell viability. As RPE cells are central to the phagocytosis of POS and the clearance of cellular debris, resveratrol’s preservation of cytoskeletal integrity and lysosomal function should indirectly support these processes, ensuring efficient turnover of photoreceptor outer segments and maintaining retinal homeostasis (Pop et al., 2022; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021).

The expected overall effect in a cellular assay would be a significant decrease in markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, combined with increased indicators of mitochondrial health and autophagy activity. In supportive in vivo models, especially those that mimic features of dry AMD, one would anticipate functional improvements observed as stabilization or improvement in retinal structure and possibly visual function, even though current clinical studies have primarily focused on wet AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014). Preclinical models have shown that resveratrol not only improves mitochondrial function but also reduces the formation of neovascular lesions, even if these are more directly related to wet AMD; the underlying mechanisms—in particular, SIRT1 activation and the resultant cellular protection—are highly applicable to the pathophysiology of dry AMD.

Overall Evaluation:
Resveratrol represents a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic for dry AMD based on its well-characterized mechanisms of action and extensive preclinical data supporting its neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. One of its principal strengths lies in its ability to activate SIRT1, a central mediator of cellular stress responses, which in turn facilitates the deacetylation and activation of PGC-1α. This interaction is crucial for promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and improving overall cellular energetics, which is particularly beneficial in RPE cells that are compromised by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in dry AMD (Delmas et al., 2021; Bola et al., 2014).

Moreover, resveratrol’s ability to upregulate endogenous antioxidant defenses by modulating the Nrf2 pathway and suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines through NF-κB inhibition further reinforces its protective capacity in the retinal environment. Such multifactorial actions contribute to the preservation of RPE cell function, including processes such as autophagy and the phagocytosis of POS, which are essential for retinal homeostasis and visual function (Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021; Pop et al., 2022). Additionally, the compound’s extensive safety record in clinical and preclinical studies—for instance, as evidenced by its inclusion in various clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014)—supports its potential for rapid translation into clinical settings for dry AMD.

However, there are also notable weaknesses. One of the principal challenges with resveratrol is its low oral bioavailability due to rapid metabolism and photosensitivity. While this drawback has been addressed in part by the development of analogs and novel ocular formulations (such as nanoparticles and lipid-based encapsulation), these delivery systems are still under investigation and require further clinical validation (Delmas et al., 2021). Moreover, although there is ample biochemical and preclinical evidence of its efficacy in RPE cell models and other neurodegenerative contexts, direct clinical evidence in the treatment of dry AMD is currently limited. Most of the clinical trials to date have focused primarily on exudative (wet) AMD or diabetic macular edema, leaving a gap in the literature regarding its efficacy as a standalone treatment for dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014).

A further point to consider is the reliance on in vitro endpoints such as increased expression of mitochondrial biogenesis markers (TFAM, NRF1) and enhanced autophagic clearance to predict in vivo efficacy. While these are valid and informative assays, the translation of these cellular effects to meaningful clinical outcomes in dry AMD patients is not guaranteed. Finally, there is the issue of dosing and formulation strategy, as the effective concentration in vitro may not be easily replicated in the retina via systemic administration without appropriate targeted delivery systems.

In summary, the overall evaluation of resveratrol as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is encouraging. Its ability to modulate key molecular pathways—SIRT1 activation leading to enhanced PGC-1α function, increased mitochondrial biogenesis, robust antioxidative defense, and support for autophagic functions—aligns well with the proposed hypothesis for its utility in dry AMD. These actions could collectively slow the progression of RPE degeneration, reduce the accumulation of lipofuscin, and maintain the essential phagocytic functions necessary for POS turnover in the retina (Bola et al., 2014; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021). The strengths of a well-established target engagement profile and extensive preclinical validation are balanced by challenges including bioavailability and the need for more focused clinical trials in dry AMD populations. Nevertheless, with the advent of advanced ocular drug delivery systems and the possibility of combining resveratrol with other complementary agents, there is substantial merit in advancing this candidate further in the drug development pipeline. Future studies should address optimized dosing strategies, formulation improvements to bypass systemic bioavailability issues, and a rigorous evaluation of its clinical efficacy specifically in dry AMD patients. Overall, resveratrol’s multifaceted pharmacological profile and robust mechanistic foundation make it a promising candidate for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration (Delmas et al., 2021; Bryl et al., 2022).

Carvedilol,"Proposal for Carvedilol

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Carvedilol is a synthetic, non‐selective β-adrenergic antagonist originally developed and widely used for cardiovascular indications, particularly in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. It belongs to the beta-blocker class of drugs but stands out because it possesses intrinsic antioxidant properties in addition to its receptor-blocking activity. Carvedilol was discovered during efforts to develop agents that not only lower heart rate and blood pressure but also provide cytoprotection by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cardiovascular tissues (Casini et al., 2014). Its formulation, such as that provided under catalog #C3993 by Sigma-Aldrich, is well characterized chemically. As a repurposing candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), carvedilol is attractive because its antioxidant capabilities and effects on oxidative stress may be leveraged in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells to alleviate the progressive oxidative damage implicated in dry AMD pathophysiology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Carvedilol has a robust clinical history in cardiovascular medicine. It is approved by the FDA and has been used extensively to treat patients with hypertension, heart failure, and diabetic cardiovascular complications. Over the past decades, its non-selective β-blockade, along with additional α1-blocking effects, has contributed to its beneficial effects on vascular remodeling and endothelial function. Furthermore, carvedilol’s antioxidant activity has been investigated in various organ systems; for instance, it has been shown to attenuate oxidative stress–mediated damage in myocardial cells by reducing ROS generation and lipid peroxidation (Casini et al., 2014). In preclinical studies, carvedilol has demonstrated neuroprotective benefits in retinal degeneration models such as the zebrafish retinitis pigmentosa (RP) model, wherein its administration improved the visual motor response and preserved rod photoreceptor numbers (Ganzen, 2020). However, although multiple clinical trials have explored carvedilol’s systemic vascular and antioxidant effects, to date there is no definitive published evidence of carvedilol being used directly to treat dry AMD or a retinal degenerative condition in either clinical or veterinary settings. Its potential application in dry AMD remains largely based on its pleiotropic properties and preliminary in vitro observations in RPE cell models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
Carvedilol operates primarily through its non-selective blockage of β-adrenergic receptors and additional antagonism at α1-adrenergic receptors. This dual blockade helps to decrease sympathetic stimulation in cardiovascular tissues, thereby reducing heart rate and lowering blood pressure. Beyond these classical pharmacological effects, carvedilol has been shown to possess significant antioxidant activity. Its molecular structure allows it to scavenge oxygen radicals, which can mitigate the generation of ROS—a key contributor to oxidative stress–induced cellular damage (Casini et al., 2014; Durak et al., 2020).

Biochemically, carvedilol’s antioxidant function is thought to be linked to its ability to preserve mitochondrial integrity by recognizing and neutralizing free radicals, thereby preventing the cascade of lipid peroxidation and subsequent cellular damage. In retinal cells, particularly in ARPE-19 RPE models, carvedilol has been proposed to activate pathways that reduce oxidative stress. Several studies have indicated that activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway—an essential cellular defense mechanism against oxidative damage—plays a critical role in protecting RPE cells from stress-induced apoptosis (Zhang et al., 2022). Although these studies were performed in the context of high glucose–induced stress and diabetic retinopathy rather than dry AMD per se, they provide a mechanistic framework that supports the use of carvedilol to mitigate ROS-mediated damage. Additionally, β-adrenergic receptors are expressed in retinal tissues, including the retinal pigment epithelium, and modulate processes relevant to angiogenesis, inflammation, and cellular survival (Casini et al., 2014). By blunting β-adrenergic signaling, carvedilol might contribute indirectly to restoring lysosomal enzyme activity—critical for the proper phagocytosis and clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by RPE cells. This restoration of lysosomal function is particularly important in dry AMD, where impaired clearance of POS leads to lipofuscin accumulation and subsequent RPE dysfunction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Expected Effect:
Based on the preclinical data and the hypothesized mechanism, the expected effect of carvedilol in the proposed dry AMD assay would be multifaceted. In ARPE-19 cells exposed to photo-oxidative stress, carvedilol is anticipated to lower ROS levels significantly—as much as 53% reduction has been observed in similar settings—and to restore lysosomal enzyme activity that is typically impaired by oxidative damage (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). These biochemical improvements should, in turn, enhance the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments by the RPE by approximately 30%, as improved lysosomal function facilitates more efficient degradation and clearance of POS. Such clearance is crucial for maintaining photoreceptor health and overall retinal homeostasis, and its impairment is a key pathological feature in dry AMD. The mechanism involves carvedilol’s ROS scavenging, preservation of mitochondrial integrity, and potential modulation of β-adrenergic receptor signaling pathways, which may also indirectly influence lysosomal dynamics and phagocytic capacity. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic studies in animal models (such as rabbits) have demonstrated that carvedilol can achieve sufficient ocular tissue penetration following systemic administration, suggesting that therapeutic levels might be attainable in the retina with appropriate dosing (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Given that β-adrenergic receptors are expressed on RPE cells and that Nrf2 expression has been documented in these cells, the action of carvedilol on these pathways is expected to confer cytoprotection against oxidative stress–induced damage (Zhang et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Carvedilol presents several strengths as a potential repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its extensive clinical use in cardiovascular diseases has resulted in a well-established safety profile and FDA approval, which can greatly accelerate its translation into clinical trials for new indications. Its dual action as a beta-blocker and antioxidant adds an appealing versatility—beyond its classical cardiovascular effects, it can directly address underlying oxidative stress that contributes to RPE dysfunction. Preclinical studies highlight its ability to lower ROS levels, preserve mitochondrial function, and potentially restore lysosomal enzymatic activity, all of which are vital for effective clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, a process impaired in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Durak et al., 2020). Furthermore, data from zebrafish models of retinal degeneration indicate that carvedilol can preserve photoreceptor integrity through modulation of β-adrenergic signaling, offering proof of concept for retinal protection even though the models studied are not direct analogs of dry AMD (Ganzen, 2020).

However, there are notable weaknesses and areas requiring further investigation. First, although carvedilol has demonstrated antioxidant and neuroprotective effects in other tissues and preclinical models, direct evidence linking these effects to improvements in lysosomal function and phagocytosis specifically in ARPE-19 cells or primary RPE cells remains limited. Much of the published data address its effects in the context of diabetic retinopathy or retinal degeneration models like retinitis pigmentosa, rather than in a dry AMD setting (Zhang et al., 2022; Ganzen, 2020). Second, while pharmacokinetic studies in rabbits suggest that sufficient ocular penetration may be achieved with systemic administration, more detailed studies are needed to confirm that therapeutic levels can be consistently attained in the human retina without systemic toxicity (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Third, the role of β-adrenergic receptor signaling in the RPE is complex; while blockade may reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, it could also potentially adversely affect neuroprotective tachykinin pathways. Careful dose titration and a clear understanding of the downstream signaling effects in retinal cells are necessary before proceeding.

In summary, carvedilol’s potential for treating dry AMD is supported by its established antioxidant properties, possible ability to restore lysosomal function and phagocytosis in RPE cells, and favorable safety profile from cardiovascular use. Its mechanism—encompassing ROS scavenging, Nrf2/ARE pathway activation, and modulation of β-adrenergic receptor signaling—aligns well with the pathophysiology of dry AMD, where oxidative stress and impaired photoreceptor outer segment clearance are key contributors to disease progression (Casini et al., 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nonetheless, further mechanistic studies in ARPE-19 cells and relevant animal models of dry AMD are required to directly validate its efficacy, as is refined ocular pharmacokinetic profiling in a retinal context. Overall, carvedilol represents a promising repurposing candidate for dry AMD that merits additional preclinical investigation to clarify its potential benefits in this indication, while the existing clinical safety data provide an encouraging foundation (Ganzen, 2020; Casini et al., 2014).

SR9011 (agonist of REV-ERBα/β; Cayman Chemical Cat# 17307),"Proposal for SR9011 (agonist of REV-ERBα/β; Cayman Chemical Cat# 17307)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SR9011 is a synthetic agonist targeting the nuclear receptors REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ that was derived and optimized from earlier chemical scaffolds such as GSK4112 through structure–activity relationship studies, resulting in compounds with higher potency and improved pharmacokinetic properties (Kojetin & Burris, 2014). It belongs to the class of synthetic nuclear receptor modulators, a group of compounds that have been broadly employed in research to modulate circadian rhythm, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory responses in various tissues (Kojetin & Burris, 2014). The chemical synthesis of SR9011 involves modifications that enhance its receptor-binding affinity and metabolic stability, leading to in vivo efficacy when administered at doses in the range of 50–100 mg/kg in rodent preclinical studies (Huang et al., 2022). This compound is also known to exhibit a greater potency at REV-ERBβ relative to SR9009, thereby offering a broader engagement with the REV-ERB family while preserving the mechanistic specificity of receptor activation (Zhang-sun et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
The REV-ERB agonist class, including compounds such as SR9009 and SR9011, has been extensively investigated in preclinical studies addressing circadian rhythm regulation, metabolic diseases, and inflammatory pathologies (Kojetin & Burris, 2014). Although these compounds were originally developed to modulate metabolic processes and circadian parameters in cancer models, obesity, and cardiovascular conditions (Wang et al., 2020), emerging evidence has demonstrated their potential cytoprotective effects in cellular models that mimic oxidative stress conditions, particularly in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells (Huang et al., 2022). Several studies have shown that pharmacological activation of REV-ERBα by agonists can protect RPE cells from oxidative damage and age-related degeneration by upregulating antioxidant gene expression and improving mitochondrial function, which are hallmarks of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Huang et al., 2022). While direct clinical use of SR9011 specifically for dry AMD has not yet been documented in the literature or clinical trial databases, the extensive preclinical research and the broad scientific interest in using REV-ERB agonists in retinal degeneration models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) provide a compelling rationale for advanced investigation in this indication.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, REV-ERBα is an orphan nuclear receptor that normally functions as a transcriptional repressor by pairing with corepressor complexes such as NCOR and HDAC3, thereby regulating circadian genes and various metabolic pathways (Kojetin & Burris, 2014). However, recent research in RPE cells reveals that REV-ERBα can act in a redox-sensitive capacity to transcriptionally activate NFE2L2, the gene that encodes the master antioxidant regulator NRF2 (Huang et al., 2022). SR9011’s dual activation of REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ is therefore expected to potentiate NRF2-driven antioxidant defenses by increasing the transcription of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD1, SOD2) and catalase, thereby reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the RPE under oxidative stress (Huang et al., 2022). This agonism not only promotes enhanced antioxidant capacity but also influences mitochondrial protection by normalizing mitochondrial respiration, as evidenced by improved oxygen consumption rates and healthier mitochondrial morphology in RPE cells treated with REV-ERB agonists (Huang et al., 2022). Moreover, REV-ERB activation has been implicated in facilitating autophagic turnover, which can boost the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) via MerTK/αvβ5-dependent phagocytosis; this is critical because RPE phagocytic dysfunction is a key pathogenic event in dry AMD (Huang et al., 2022). Additionally, the molecular interactions of SR9011 with REV-ERBα/β induce cytoskeletal rearrangements that are necessary for the enhancement of phagocytosis, contributing to the restoration of RPE functionality (Huang et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
Based on the working hypothesis, SR9011-mediated dual activation of REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ in oxidative stress–challenged RPE cells is anticipated to produce a synergistic enhancement of NRF2-driven antioxidant defenses. In such a cellular environment, increased NRF2 activity would lead to the upregulation of detoxifying enzymes and enhanced quenching of ROS, thereby mitigating the oxidative stress that contributes to RPE degeneration in dry AMD (Huang et al., 2022). The normalization of mitochondrial respiration is further expected through improved mitochondrial biogenesis and function, as REV-ERB agonists have been shown to modulate mitochondrial oxidative capacity in various tissues (Woldt et al., 2013). With respect to POS clearance, SR9011 is hypothesized to potentiate phagocytosis by stimulating downstream signaling routes involving MerTK and αvβ5 integrin; this would be facilitated by boosting autophagic turnover and reorganization of the cytoskeleton, thereby preventing the accumulation of photoreceptor debris that is characteristic of dry AMD (Huang et al., 2022). The compound’s efficacy has been preliminarily supported by preclinical observations in both in vitro RPE models and in vivo rodent studies, where dosing regimens of 50–100 mg/kg have demonstrated significant cytoprotection without systemic toxicity, indicating a favorable therapeutic index (Huang et al., 2022). Furthermore, gene expression analyses in these studies have corroborated the presence of high levels of REV-ERBα in RPE cells, underpinning the relevance of targeting this receptor for antioxidant defense and phagocytic maintenance (Huang et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
SR9011 presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration due to its multifaceted mechanism of action and potent preclinical efficacy in RPE models. One of the main strengths of SR9011 is its dual activation of REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ, which leverages the intrinsic redundancy and complementary functions of these nuclear receptors to maximize the upregulation of NRF2-mediated antioxidant defense while simultaneously optimizing mitochondrial respiration and phagocytic clearance (Zhang-sun et al., 2023). This dual-engagement strategy not only offers a novel approach to account for the complex pathophysiology of dry AMD, where oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and defective phagocytosis play intertwined roles, but also confers a mechanistic novelty that is superior to earlier REV-ERB agonists with more limited receptor specificity (Huang et al., 2022).

From a biochemical standpoint, the mode of action of SR9011 is well-aligned with the endogenous protective pathways in RPE cells. Its ability to transcriptionally activate NFE2L2 and consequently boost the production of critical antioxidant enzymes is a significant advantage because NRF2 is a key mediator of cytoprotection against oxidative insults—a fundamental pathogenic mechanism in dry AMD (Huang et al., 2022). Additionally, the improvement in mitochondrial respiration observed following SR9011 treatment addresses another major contributor to RPE degeneration, as mitochondrial insufficiency and impaired ATP production jeopardize the overall cellular viability of the RPE (Huang et al., 2022). The compound’s anticipated effect on promoting autophagic turnover and enhancing phagocytosis through MerTK/αvβ5-dependent pathways is particularly critical because the efficient clearance of POS is essential for maintaining retinal homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of toxic debris that leads to drusen formation in dry AMD (Huang et al., 2022).

Despite these strengths, there are also potential weaknesses and challenges that must be addressed. One concern is the risk of off-target effects associated with synthetic REV-ERB agonists, as some compounds in this class have been linked to interactions with receptors outside the intended REV-ERB family, such as LXRα, which could complicate the pharmacological profile and adversely affect safety (Zhang-sun et al., 2023). Although SR9011 is cited as having higher potency and a favorable systemic toxicity profile in preclinical rodent models (Huang et al., 2022), its safety and selectivity will need to be thoroughly evaluated in extended toxicology studies and in different species before clinical translation can be confidently pursued. There is also the challenge of ensuring robust and consistent activation of NRF2 in the RPE, given that the precise interplay between REV-ERB activation and NRF2 signaling might be influenced by the oxidative state of the cells and other context-dependent factors (Huang et al., 2022). Furthermore, while preliminary data support the role of REV-ERB agonists in enhancing POS phagocytosis, the detailed mechanisms underlying the cytoskeletal rearrangements and autophagic processes remain to be fully elucidated, which may require further mechanistic studies to optimize dosing regimens and to anticipate long-term effects in chronic disease models (Huang et al., 2022).

In summary, SR9011 is an advanced synthetic REV-ERB agonist with a strong preclinical rationale for use in dry age-related macular degeneration based on its comprehensive mechanism of action. It acts as a potent activator of REV-ERBα/β, thereby enhancing NRF2-driven antioxidant defenses, normalizing mitochondrial respiration, and facilitating the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments in RPE cells. This multi-targeted mechanism addresses several key pathological features of dry AMD, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired clearance of cellular debris (Huang et al., 2022). The compound’s demonstrated efficacy at preclinical doses, combined with its improved receptor engagement and favorable safety profile in rodents, underscores its potential as an optimized therapeutic candidate for clinical development in dry AMD. However, further studies are warranted to conclusively address any off-target effects, validate its mechanistic pathways in more complex in vivo models, and confirm its long-term safety profile. Overall, the dual-action characteristics and mechanistic specificity of SR9011 make it a particularly attractive candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD, meriting further investigation in advanced preclinical and eventual clinical studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Naringenin,"Proposal for Naringenin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Naringenin is a naturally occurring citrus flavonoid isolated from fruits such as grapefruits and oranges. It belongs to the flavonoid class that has been extensively studied for its antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and lipid regulatory effects in diverse biological systems. Naringenin is commercially available (for example, from Sigma-Aldrich catalog #N0753) and has been the subject of research for its potential to modulate multiple oxidative and metabolic pathways. In the context of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), naringenin is of particular interest because flavonoids as a class have demonstrated vascular and cellular protective effects in ocular tissues – an observation that is supported in the literature through studies of citrus flavonoids and their nutritional as well as pharmacological properties (Maiuolo et al., 2022; Pawlowska et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, naringenin and its related citrus flavonoids have been investigated in various biochemical models for their antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Although there are no registered clinical trials directly investigating naringenin’s efficacy in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), the preclinical data from biochemical and cell-based studies offer encouraging results. For instance, research into polyphenolic compounds in ocular diseases has demonstrated that natural antioxidants like naringenin can modulate key pathways in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, similar to effects observed with other antioxidants such as quercetin and lutein (Chen et al., 2023; Azam & Jastrzębska, 2025). Although direct clinical or even extensive preclinical studies in dry AMD are limited, the underlying pharmacological actions known from other models indicate that compounds from this class have the potential to mitigate oxidative stress, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve cellular homeostasis in ocular tissues (Pawlowska et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
The proposed mechanism of action for naringenin in dry AMD centers on its dual ability to modulate NRF2-mediated antioxidant pathways as well as PPARγ signaling in RPE cells. NRF2 is a transcription factor that orchestrates the expression of an array of antioxidant enzymes including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). Under conditions of oxidative stress, NRF2 typically translocates to the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) to induce the expression of these cytoprotective enzymes (Chen et al., 2023). Naringenin has been reported to promote the nuclear translocation of NRF2, thereby upregulating key antioxidant enzymes that reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in RPE cells (Chen et al., 2023). Furthermore, this compound also exerts modulatory effects on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a nuclear receptor critical for lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis, and anti-inflammatory responses. Activation of PPARγ supports lipid clearance and reconciles lipid metabolism, thereby reducing lipotoxicity in the RPE that is a contributing factor in dry AMD pathogenesis (Basyal et al., 2024). Additionally, naringenin is suggested to promote lysosomal biogenesis, as evidenced by increased levels of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) in cell culture systems, which would enhance the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments that accumulate during age-related dysfunction (Basyal et al., 2024). In summary, at the molecular level, naringenin is proposed to reduce oxidative and lipid stress through the coordinated activation of NRF2 and PPARγ signaling cascades, which results in upregulated expression of antioxidant enzymes, improved lysosomal function, and enhanced cellular clearance mechanisms (Chen et al., 2023; Abokyi, 2021).

Expected Effect:
In the experimental assay proposed, naringenin is expected to exert multiple beneficial effects on iPSC-derived RPE cells that mimic the pathological environment observed in dry AMD. The candidate, applied at a concentration of 20 µM, is hypothesized to produce the following outcomes: a 50% reduction in intracellular ROS levels through enhanced NRF2-mediated upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, normalization of lysosomal pH leading to improved enzymatic activity in photoreceptor outer segment degradation, an increase in the lysosomal marker LAMP1 by approximately 1.8-fold that correlates with improved lysosomal biogenesis, and an improvement in FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segment (FITC-POS) phagocytosis by around 32% indicating restored clearance capacity (Basyal et al., 2024). These effects are expected to occur because RPE cells express high levels of NRF2 and PPARγ, both of which are critical in maintaining redox balance and lipid homeostasis; indeed, deficiencies in these pathways have been directly linked to RPE degeneration in dry AMD (Chen et al., 2023; Basyal et al., 2024). Furthermore, rodent ocular pharmacokinetic studies have confirmed the retinal distribution of naringenin following oral dosing, providing additional support that the compound can reach target tissues in the eye (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of naringenin as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is promising based on a combination of its natural origin, documented safety profile, and mechanistic specificity. One major strength of naringenin is its ability to act on multiple validated pathogenic mechanisms concurrently. The dual modulation of NRF2-mediated antioxidant defense pathways and PPARγ signaling is particularly attractive because it addresses both the oxidative stress and lipid dysregulation that are known to cause RPE dysfunction in dry AMD (Chen et al., 2023; Abokyi, 2021). The experimental data indicating a significant reduction in ROS levels, normalization of lysosomal pH, enhanced lysosomal biogenesis (reflected by increased LAMP1 expression), and improved phagocytic function of RPE cells supports its potential efficacy in restoring RPE homeostasis (Basyal et al., 2024). Additionally, the fact that oral dosing in rodent models results in meaningful retinal tissue distribution further supports its candidacy as an ocular therapeutic (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, there are some weaknesses to consider. Firstly, there is a notable absence of clinical trials directly testing naringenin in the context of dry AMD, which underscores an urgent need for further translational research. The lack of direct biochemical and clinical efficacy data in human tissue or patient populations creates uncertainty regarding its therapeutic window and long-term safety in the specialized ocular environment (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Secondly, while the in vitro effects are compelling, differences in bioavailability, metabolic stability, and ocular penetration in humans might pose challenges for clinical development. Moreover, while other flavonoids have demonstrated similar mechanistic properties, the extent to which naringenin can uniquely modulate PPARγ signaling in the context of RPE function remains to be fully elucidated (Basyal et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023).

Overall, naringenin presents a compelling multi-target profile for dry AMD therapy, leveraging its antioxidant and lipid regulatory properties to potentially reverse or mitigate the degenerative processes in RPE cells. Its natural origin and favorable safety record as a nutraceutical further enhance its attractiveness as a candidate for drug repurposing and development. Nonetheless, to move forward, further preclinical studies focusing on comprehensive pharmacodynamics, ocular pharmacokinetics, and ultimately early-phase clinical trials will be critical to validate its efficacy and safety in patients with dry AMD (Chen et al., 2023; Abokyi, 2021; Kovács-Valasek et al., 2023).

In conclusion, the evidence supports advancing naringenin for further investigation as a therapeutic candidate in dry AMD, particularly given its dual action on both NRF2-mediated antioxidant pathways and PPARγ signaling in RPE cells. The mechanistic rationale, complemented by promising in vitro assay outcomes and supportive ocular distribution data in rodent models, provides a strong impetus for further development. However, the current gap in clinical trial data and the necessity for detailed preclinical safety profiles highlight areas that require urgent attention. The research team is encouraged to pursue additional studies that will address these aspects while further elucidating the molecular targets of naringenin in RPE cells to substantiate its potential in mitigating the multifactorial pathogenesis of dry AMD (Basyal et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023).

SRT1720 (SIRT1 activator; Cayman Chemical Cat# 12054),"Proposal for SRT1720 (SIRT1 activator; Cayman Chemical Cat# 12054)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SRT1720 is a synthetic small molecule classified as a SIRT1‐activating compound (STAC) that was discovered through high‐throughput screening methods using fluorophore‐tagged peptide substrates (Milne et al., 2007). It belongs to the class of sirtuin activators that are designed to mimic the beneficial effects of caloric restriction by enhancing the activity of SIRT1, a NAD⁺‐dependent deacetylase implicated in longevity, metabolism, and cellular stress responses (Camins et al., 2010). SRT1720, structurally unrelated to natural polyphenols like resveratrol, was synthesized to overcome the poor bioavailability and off‐target effects associated with natural compounds, and its chemical optimization has yielded a candidate that reportedly enhances SIRT1 enzymatic activity by over 100-fold in in vitro biochemical assays (Baur, 2010). As part of a wider drug class that has been explored for metabolic diseases, cancer, and aging, sirtuin activators such as SRT1720 have been used in various preclinical studies to assess their impact on mitochondrial function and oxidative stress responses, which are critical to maintaining cellular homeostasis (Granchi & Minutolo, 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Biochemically, SRT1720 has been evaluated in several animal models, particularly in the context of metabolic dysfunction. Preclinical studies in obese rodent models have demonstrated that oral SRT1720 dosing improves glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and mitochondrial respiration in tissues like liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue (Wan, 2021). Although its initial evaluation was primarily focused on metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, additional research suggested potential anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic benefits in other degenerative conditions (Giblin Jr., 2017). While there is no direct record of SRT1720 having been used clinically in dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD), its mechanism of improving mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress has led research teams to propose its repurposing for retinal diseases such as dry AMD, given that similar mitochondrial and oxidative injury pathways drive retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration (Golestaneh et al., 2016; Buonfiglio et al., 2024). Previous experimental studies employing ARPE-19 cells have shown that SIRT1 activation can reduce p62 levels and increase LC3-II accumulation under stress conditions, consistent with improved autophagy, although these findings are more established for natural activators like resveratrol rather than SRT1720 itself (Balaiya et al., 2017). Nonetheless, the metabolic benefits observed in non-ocular models provided the rationale for evaluating SRT1720 in ocular disease models, aligning with evidence that SIRT1 activation supports RPE health by deacetylating key proteins such as PGC-1α and FoxO3a (Fang et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
SRT1720 is designed to activate SIRT1 by binding allosterically to the SIRT1–substrate complex, thereby lowering the Michaelis constant (K_m) for both the acetylated substrates and NAD⁺, which enhances the catalytic efficiency of SIRT1 (Milne et al., 2007; Sinclair & Hubbard, 2013). The biochemical mechanism is thought to involve deacetylation of critical substrates such as PGC-1α and FoxO transcription factors; PGC-1α, in turn, is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, while FoxO3a modulates cellular stress responses and autophagy (Golestaneh et al., 2016; Camins et al., 2010). Activation of SIRT1 leads to the deacetylation of PGC-1α, enhancing its transcriptional activity, which results in increased expression of genes involved in mitochondrial replication and oxidative phosphorylation, thereby boosting cellular energy production (He, 2010). In addition, deacetylation of FoxO3a promotes autophagy—a critical mechanism for the clearance of damaged proteins and organelles—and enhances the antioxidant response, both of which are essential for maintaining RPE cell function under chronic oxidative stress conditions (Balaiya et al., 2017; Fang et al., 2021). SRT1720’s mechanism may also indirectly influence metabolic pathways by modulating insulin sensitivity and inflammatory cytokine production through SIRT1-dependent inhibition of NF-κB, although some controversies remain regarding whether SRT1720 acts exclusively through direct SIRT1 activation or via off-target effects such as AMPK activation (Sinclair & Hubbard, 2013; Pacholec et al., 2010).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry AMD, the primary hypothesis is that SRT1720-induced SIRT1 activation will lead to the deacetylation of PGC-1α, which will then upregulate mitochondrial biogenesis and enhance cellular ATP production within RPE cells (Golestaneh et al., 2016). By promoting the activity of FoxO3a, SRT1720 is also expected to trigger autophagic pathways that clear cellular debris, thereby reducing p62 accumulation and increasing LC3-II, markers consistent with active autophagy (Balaiya et al., 2017). This consequent improvement in autophagy, in conjunction with enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, should theoretically ameliorate oxidative stress—a major driver of RPE degeneration and a hallmark of dry AMD (Fang et al., 2021; Luján et al., 2022). There is experimental evidence from ARPE-19 cell studies suggesting that SIRT1 activation can restore aspects of RPE phagocytic function and mitigate stress-induced damage (Balaiya et al., 2017), which directly supports the underlying hypothesis that SRT1720 will improve RPE viability and function in dry AMD assays. The expected effect is that, following oral dosing, SRT1720 will achieve plasma levels sufficient to exert these cellular effects in the rodent retina, thus offering a targeted intervention that addresses energy deficits, oxidative damage, and dysfunctional autophagy in the RPE (Wan, 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of SRT1720 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is cautiously optimistic. On the strengths side, SRT1720 offers a mechanistically precise intervention by targeting the SIRT1/PGC-1α/FoxO3a axis, which is central to mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, and oxidative stress responses—all pathological processes implicated in the degeneration of RPE cells in dry AMD (Golestaneh et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2021). The compound’s high in vitro potency, with reported over 100-fold activation of SIRT1 compared to natural activators, lends strong biochemical rationale to its proposed benefits (Milne et al., 2007). Furthermore, preclinical data demonstrating improvements in mitochondrial function and anti-inflammatory effects in metabolic disease models reinforce the potential for SRT1720 to address the energy deficits and oxidative damage characteristic of dry AMD (Wan, 2021; Modi, 2018). However, there are notable weaknesses and limitations. First, despite promising in vitro data, some studies have raised concerns that SRT1720 may not directly activate SIRT1 when using native substrates, and its biochemical effects may be subject to assay artifacts (Pacholec et al., 2010), necessitating further validation in ocular-specific models. Second, while the data in metabolic and cancer models are encouraging, there is a lack of direct clinical evidence in dry AMD or even in retinal pigment epithelium cells, meaning that extrapolation from non-ocular systems remains speculative (Mimura et al., 2013; Golestaneh et al., 2016). Third, potential off-target effects—such as inadvertent activation of AMPK or inhibition of phosphodiesterases—could complicate the pharmacodynamic profile of SRT1720 (Sinclair & Hubbard, 2013; Park et al., 2017). Additionally, issues regarding the bioavailability of SRT1720 in ocular tissues have yet to be definitively addressed, although preliminary reports indicate that oral dosing can achieve plasma levels active in rodent retina (Wan, 2021). Finally, the complexity of dry AMD pathogenesis—where multiple interconnected pathways contribute to RPE dysfunction—means that the therapeutic efficacy of a single-target intervention such as SRT1720 may only be partial unless used in combination with other treatments (Buonfiglio et al., 2024).

In summary, the literature review indicates that SRT1720 represents a promising, mechanistically justified candidate for repurposing in dry AMD by virtue of its potent activation of SIRT1 and the downstream engagement of mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagic processes critical to RPE health (Golestaneh et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2021). Its synthetic origin and improved potency over natural compounds such as resveratrol make it an attractive option for targeting the energy and clearance deficits observed in dry AMD (Camins et al., 2010; Baur, 2010). Nevertheless, the limitations concerning the direct activation mechanism, potential off-target effects, and the need for corroborative studies in retinal models necessitate further rigorous experimental and preclinical evaluation before advancing to clinical studies in dry AMD patients (Pacholec et al., 2010; Mimura et al., 2013). Overall, SRT1720 has potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD if its efficacy and safety in RPE cells and in vivo retinal models can be conclusively demonstrated, thereby paving the way for targeted intervention against the mitochondrial and oxidative pathological mechanisms underlying dry AMD (Balaiya et al., 2017; Fang et al., 2021).

ZLN005 (PGC-1α transcriptional activator; MedChemExpress Cat# HY-12491),"Proposal for ZLN005 (PGC-1α transcriptional activator; MedChemExpress Cat# HY-12491)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
ZLN005 is a small-molecule synthetic compound originally identified through small-molecule screening programs designed to activate the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha). As a selective pharmaceutical inducer of PGC-1α, ZLN005 belongs to the class of compounds that modulate gene transcription to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. Its discovery was initially reported in contexts involving skeletal muscle metabolism, where it was shown to robustly upregulate both PGC-1α mRNA and protein levels, thereby stimulating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation gene networks. More recently, its utility has been explored in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells—in particular, the ARPE-19 cell line—to examine its potential protective effects against oxidative stress implicated in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 1–2). ZLN005 has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, including oral bioavailability, which is significant for repurposing efforts because such properties can facilitate rapid clinical translation relative to compounds that require invasive delivery methods. As a member of the transcriptional activator class, compounds like ZLN005 have been used in metabolic research to enhance mitochondrial capacity and antioxidant defenses, and the current interest lies in repurposing these benefits for RPE cell health in the context of AMD (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 1–2; Miller et al., 2019, pp. 2–4).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, ZLN005 emerged from research aimed primarily at addressing metabolic dysfunction observed in conditions such as diabetes and cardiomyopathy. Studies in skeletal muscle and cardiac cells demonstrated that ZLN005 effectively increases PGC-1α expression, thereby driving mitochondrial biogenesis and improving energy metabolism in preclinical models. Although its initial application was not in ocular diseases, more recent investigations have applied ZLN005 to ARPE-19 cells—a commonly used in vitro model of human retinal pigment epithelium—to assess its potential in counteracting oxidative stress-induced cell damage associated with dry AMD (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 5–6). To date, no clinical trials or veterinary applications have evaluated ZLN005 specifically for dry AMD, nor have there been studies in animal models of the disease that are widely reported in the literature; however, its ability to upregulate PGC-1α in vitro, along with its protective effects against exposure to hydrogen peroxide, oxidized LDL, and sodium iodate (oxidative stressors relevant to AMD), provides a rationale for further preclinical exploration (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 7–8; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Similar strategies have been used in other studies where enhancement of mitochondrial function and antioxidant defenses in RPE cells was therapeutic in models of dry AMD, and PGC-1α itself has been shown to regulate lysosomal enzyme gene networks as well as phagocytic processes (Tong et al., 2022, pp. 14–16).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, ZLN005 operates by selectively upregulating the expression of PGC-1α, a key transcriptional coactivator that orchestrates mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant gene expression. In ARPE-19 cells subjected to ZLN005 treatment, studies have documented a 10‐μM dose over 48 hours that produces significant increases in both PGC-1α mRNA and protein levels; this upregulation fosters the expression of downstream mitochondrial biogenesis genes such as TFAM (mitochondrial transcription factor A), MFN1 (mitofusin 1), and POLG (mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma) (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 2–4). In addition, ZLN005 treatment enhances the expression of RPE-specific genes (for instance, BEST1 and RLBP1) as well as genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, including ATP50, COX4, and NDUFB5, thereby improving oxidative respiration capacity as measured by increased basal, maximal, and spare respiratory rates. A crucial aspect of ZLN005’s mechanism includes the subsequent elevation of antioxidant enzymes—such as SOD1, SOD2, and TXN2—which serve to decrease mitochondrial superoxide production and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. The resulting reduction in oxidative stress is critical because high ROS levels negatively impact various cellular functions, including MerTK signaling, which is central to the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by RPE cells (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 6–7; Tong et al., 2022, pp. 14–16). Although the precise biochemical interactions include the modulation of upstream regulators such as AMP-kinase and SIRT1—which are known to further potentiate the activity of PGC-1α—the central mode of action remains the transcriptional activation of PGC-1α and its gene networks that govern mitochondrial and lysosomal enzyme expression (Miller et al., 2019, pp. 2–4). By enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and function, ZLN005 indirectly supports lysosomal activity since the energetic demands of lysosomal clearance and phagocytosis are tightly coupled to mitochondrial capacity. Additionally, improved mitochondrial function contributes to maintaining MerTK-mediated signaling pathways that facilitate the clearance of POS, thereby potentially improving overall RPE cellular homeostasis (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 7–8; Tong et al., 2022, pp. 14–16).

Expected Effect:
In the specific context of dry AMD, the hypothesis is that ZLN005 will lead to a multifaceted improvement in RPE cell health by directly upregulating PGC-1α. In the proposed cell-based assays using ARPE-19 and human RPE cells, ZLN005 is expected to produce a measurable increase in PGC-1α expression, accompanied by a coordinated upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis markers such as TFAM, MFN1, and POLG—all of which are critical for generating functionally competent mitochondria at a time when RPE cells suffer from mitochondrial dysfunction due to aging and oxidative stress (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 2–4). This enhancement of mitochondrial mass and function is expected to elevate cellular ATP production and improve oxidative phosphorylation, thereby reducing the intracellular burden of ROS. Lower ROS levels, in turn, would lead to decreased oxidative modifications of proteins and lipids that otherwise impair signaling pathways such as those mediated by MerTK. MerTK signaling is responsible for the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments, a process that is compromised in dry AMD, and restoration of this pathway through improved mitochondrial health is anticipated to enhance POS digestion and clearance (Tong et al., 2022, pp. 14–16). Additionally, the activation of PGC-1α is predicted to upregulate lysosomal enzyme expression, including factors such as LAMP2, which are critical for maintaining lysosomal integrity and function. By preventing the accumulation of lipofuscin granules and improving overall lysosomal clearance, ZLN005 supports the recycling and degradation functions of RPE cells, further contributing to the restoration of retinal homeostasis (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 8–9). The expected cumulative effect is that, by improving mitochondrial and lysosomal function through PGC-1α activation, ZLN005 will mitigate the pathological cascade seen in dry AMD—where chronic oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired phagocytosis converge to drive retinal degeneration (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
The potential of ZLN005 as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is supported by several compelling lines of evidence. Its primary strength lies in its capacity to activate PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defense, thereby directly addressing key pathological features of AMD. The ability of ZLN005 to enhance mitochondrial respiration, increase ATP production, and upregulate the expression of critical mitochondrial and lysosomal genes in ARPE-19 cells presents a robust biological rationale for its efficacy (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 5–6; Satish et al., 2018, pp. 7–8). These mechanisms are particularly relevant given that mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated ROS levels are central drivers of RPE degeneration in dry AMD. Furthermore, the compound’s favorable pharmacokinetic properties and oral bioavailability make it an attractive candidate for rapid repurposing compared to many experimental therapeutics that require more invasive modes of administration (Miller et al., 2019, pp. 2–4).

However, several weaknesses and uncertainties warrant consideration. The majority of the supportive evidence for ZLN005's efficacy comes from in vitro studies using the ARPE-19 cell line, and while these models are highly informative for mechanistic investigation, they do not fully recapitulate the complexities of the aging human retina and dry AMD pathology. There are as yet no robust animal model data or clinical trial results directly assessing the efficacy of ZLN005 in the setting of dry AMD; thus, its translation from cell culture to a whole-organism context remains speculative (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, while activation of PGC-1α is theorized to improve lysosomal enzyme expression and aid in phagocytosis via MerTK signaling, direct evidence linking ZLN005-mediated PGC-1α upregulation to enhanced POS digestion has not been conclusively demonstrated in the current literature. There is also an inherent risk of off-target effects or excessive activation of mitochondrial biogenesis pathways, which in some contexts can lead to cellular stress or even cell death if not properly regulated (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 1–2; Satish et al., 2018, pp. 7–8).

In conclusion, ZLN005 represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD based on its ability to modulate PGC-1α and thereby enhance mitochondrial and lysosomal function. The comprehensive literature supports that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired phagocytosis are central to RPE degeneration in dry AMD, and that pharmacologically restoring mitochondrial biogenesis may ameliorate these defects. Strengths of ZLN005 include its specific activation of a critical transcriptional regulator, favorable pharmacokinetics, and the preclinical data suggesting protection against oxidative insults. Nonetheless, further research is needed—particularly in animal models and clinical trials—to evaluate whether these in vitro benefits translate into meaningful therapeutic outcomes in patients with dry AMD. The next steps should include detailed in vivo studies to assess the impact of ZLN005 on mitochondrial function, lysosomal enzyme levels, ROS reduction, and ultimately on phagocytic clearance through MerTK signaling in a model that closely mimics dry AMD pathology (Tong et al., 2022, pp. 14–16; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Eculizumab (Soliris; Alexion Pharmaceuticals),"Proposal for Eculizumab (Soliris; Alexion Pharmaceuticals)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Eculizumab (Soliris), developed by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, is a recombinant, humanized immunoglobulin G monoclonal antibody originally derived from a murine anti‐C5 antibody that was subsequently engineered for optimal human compatibility (Bandello et al., 2017; Mata & Vogel, 2010). Synthesized using recombinant DNA technology in mammalian cell cultures, eculizumab is characterized by its high specificity for complement component C5 and its capacity to inhibit its cleavage into C5a and C5b. It belongs to the class of complement inhibitors—a group of targeted biologics designed to modulate the complement cascade by specifically binding and neutralizing key mediators that propagate inflammation and cellular damage (Bandello et al., 2017). Over the past decade, complement inhibitors have been successfully employed to treat systemic disorders in which complement overactivation plays a central pathogenic role, with eculizumab itself being approved for specific complement‐mediated diseases such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) (Mata & Vogel, 2010). In these conditions, its mechanism of action—blocking the terminal step of the complement cascade—has proven to be both effective and life‐saving. This established broad clinical profile and manufacturing feasibility position eculizumab as a promising candidate for repurposing in dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), a disease in which chronic complement dysregulation drives retinal degeneration (Armento et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History
Eculizumab’s clinical journey began with its evaluation in systemic disorders where uncontrolled complement activation is a central element of pathology. In the hematologic disorder paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), for instance, eculizumab’s ability to inhibit the formation of C5a and the membrane attack complex (MAC) has led to marked reductions in intravascular hemolysis and improved patient outcomes (Mata & Vogel, 2010). Its subsequent approval for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) further emphasized its efficacy in halting complement-mediated tissue injury (Bandello et al., 2017). Given these successes, it was hypothesized that complement-mediated processes might also underlie the pathogenesis of dry AMD, particularly the geographic atrophy (GA) form. Histopathologic and genetic studies have consistently pointed to the role of complement dysregulation in dry AMD, with evidence of elevated C5a in retinal lesions and associations between genomic variants in complement genes and increased disease risk (Armento et al., 2021; Gemenetzi & Lotery, 2016). In dry AMD, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) undergoes chronic inflammatory insult that is partly driven by complement activation leading to inflammasome priming and subsequent pyroptosis (Brandstetter, 2016). Based on this rationale, clinical investigations were undertaken to evaluate the repurposing of eculizumab for dry AMD. The COMPLETE Phase II trial, which investigated systemic administration of eculizumab in patients with GA, demonstrated that while the drug was well tolerated, it did not yield a statistically significant reduction in GA lesion progression (Halawa et al., 2021). Other complementary studies have explored alternative routes of administration, with intravitreal delivery being favored in preclinical studies to overcome the blood-retina barrier (BRB) and achieve therapeutic retinal levels (Hammadi et al., 2023). This therapeutic history underscores both the potential of repurposing eculizumab for conditions beyond its original indications and the challenges of translating systemic complement inhibition to the retinal environment (Bandello et al., 2017; Halawa et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, eculizumab exerts its pharmacologic effect by binding with high affinity to complement component C5, a central protein in the terminal cascade of the complement system (Armento et al., 2021). Under physiologic conditions, the complement system can be activated through three distinct pathways—the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways—all culminating in the activation of complement component C3 and the subsequent generation of C3a and C3b. C3b participates in the formation of the C5 convertase, an enzymatic complex that cleaves C5 into its active fragments, C5a and C5b (Holz et al., 2014). C5a is a potent anaphylatoxin that contributes to inflammation by recruiting immune cells and promoting the release of cytokines, whereas C5b initiates the assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC, C5b-9), leading to cell lysis or sublytic injury (Armento et al., 2021).
In the context of dry AMD, elevated levels of C5a in the retina have been implicated in the priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome in RPE cells, which results in caspase-1 activation and the execution of pyroptosis—a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death (Brandstetter, 2016). Pyroptosis in the RPE is thought to contribute to the degeneration of supporting retinal structures and the eventual loss of photoreceptors responsible for vision. Concomitantly, the formation of MAC may contribute to subtle cytolytic effects on RPE cells, compromising their viability and disrupting essential functions such as the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) via autophagy and MerTK-mediated phagocytosis (Armento et al., 2021; Holz et al., 2014).
Eculizumab’s mode of action hinges on its binding to a critical epitope on the C5 molecule that is necessary for the action of C5 convertase. By locking C5 in an uncleaved state, eculizumab prevents the formation of both C5a and C5b, thereby abrogating the terminal events of the complement cascade (Armento et al., 2021; Brandstetter, 2016). This molecular blockade reduces downstream complement-mediated inflammation and cell lysis, a process that is particularly deleterious in the delicate environment of the retina. Additionally, the prevention of MAC assembly contributes to the preservation of RPE cell membrane integrity and function, which is critical for maintaining retinal homeostasis (Holz et al., 2014).
Furthermore, by impeding complement-driven inflammatory pathways, eculizumab may indirectly facilitate the stabilization of autophagic–lysosomal functioning in RPE cells. This is of paramount importance because the RPE is responsible for the continual phagocytosis and clearance of shed POS—a process that is intricately linked to cellular health and overall retinal function. Disruption of this clearance mechanism has been implicated in the accumulation of toxic debris and the formation of drusen, hallmark features of dry AMD (Armento et al., 2021). In summary, eculizumab’s molecular action of blocking C5 cleavage represents a targeted intervention aimed at neutralizing key pro-inflammatory and cytolytic mediators in the complement cascade, with anticipated downstream benefits in preserving RPE viability and function (Brandstetter, 2016).

Expected Effect
In dry AMD, particularly in the form of geographic atrophy, the progressive degeneration of the RPE layer leads to subsequent photoreceptor loss and eventual irreversible visual impairment. The working hypothesis for repurposing eculizumab in this context is based on its ability to mitigate several complement-mediated pathological processes that drive RPE degeneration (Armento et al., 2021). When administered—ideally via intravitreal injection to bypass the restrictive BRB—eculizumab is expected to achieve retinal therapeutic concentrations sufficient to block C5 cleavage effectively (Hammadi et al., 2023; Ong et al., 2024).
Specifically, by inhibiting the formation of C5a, eculizumab is anticipated to reduce the priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome within RPE cells. In vitro studies have demonstrated that C5a is a potent trigger for inflammasome activation, leading to caspase-1 activation and the subsequent execution of inflammatory cell death (Brandstetter, 2016). Consequently, a decrease in C5a levels would theoretically lead to a reduction in inflammasome activity, thereby limiting RPE pyroptosis and preserving cellular function.
Simultaneously, the blockade of C5b formation prevents the downstream assembly of the MAC, which has been implicated in RPE damage through both lytic and sublytic mechanisms (Armento et al., 2021; Holz et al., 2014). By averting MAC deposition, eculizumab could protect RPE cells from complement-mediated membrane damage that otherwise exacerbates cellular dysfunction and promotes the progression of GA.
In addition to these direct effects, the inhibition of terminal complement activation is also expected to indirectly stabilize the autophagic–lysosomal pathway in RPE cells. Under conditions of complement overactivation, the disruption of autophagy can lead to inefficient clearance of POS, resulting in the accumulation of debris and the formation of drusen—a key early step in the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Armento et al., 2021). By preserving autophagic flux, eculizumab may help to maintain the phagocytic function of RPE cells, ensuring that POS are efficiently cleared, thereby reducing the risk of toxic accumulation and further RPE stress (Armento et al., 2021).
A further expected benefit relates to the maintenance of MerTK-dependent signaling. RPE cells rely on MerTK for the recognition and phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor debris; damage to this pathway has been linked to compromised POS clearance and the exacerbation of retinal degeneration. By mitigating complement-mediated injury through C5 inhibition, eculizumab may help to preserve MerTK function, thus contributing to overall retinal homeostasis (Armento et al., 2021).
Preclinical models have underscored that targeted complement inhibition can lead to decreased markers of inflammation and reduced cell death in the retina. Although the COMPLETE clinical trial with systemic eculizumab did not achieve a statistically significant impact on GA lesion progression—most likely due to inadequate retinal drug exposure owing to the BRB—it provides a proof-of-concept that targeting C5 affects key pathological pathways (Halawa et al., 2021). Intravitreal administration is posited as an approach to achieve direct drug delivery to the RPE and retina, thereby enabling a more pronounced pharmacodynamic effect that would manifest as a stabilization or slowing of GA progression as measurable by imaging endpoints and functional tests (Hammadi et al., 2023; Ong et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation
The prospect of repurposing eculizumab for dry AMD arises from a strong molecular and genetic rationale that places complement dysregulation—a key driver of inflammation, RPE cell death, and impaired retinal clearance—at the heart of the disease’s pathogenesis (Armento et al., 2021; Brandstetter, 2016). One of the major strengths of eculizumab is its robust mechanism of action. Through high-affinity binding to complement component C5, it effectively prevents its cleavage into the pro-inflammatory fragments C5a and C5b, thereby halting the generation of both inflammatory mediators and the membrane attack complex (MAC) (Armento et al., 2021; Brandstetter, 2016). This targeted inhibition directly addresses the cascade of events implicated in RPE dysfunction in dry AMD, including inflammasome activation and subsequent pyroptosis.
Another considerable strength is the established clinical safety and regulatory approval of eculizumab in systemic complement-mediated diseases such as PNH and aHUS. The wealth of safety data derived from its use in these severe conditions reduces the developmental risk when repurposing the agent for retinal disease indications. Moreover, the existing manufacturing infrastructure and quality control measures, honed over years of clinical use, facilitate a streamlined path toward regulatory approval in a new therapeutic area (Bandello et al., 2017; Mata & Vogel, 2010).
However, significant challenges remain that temper enthusiasm for the straightforward repurposing of eculizumab in dry AMD. Foremost among these is the issue of drug delivery. The blood-retina barrier (BRB) has repeatedly been implicated as a major obstacle to achieving therapeutic retinal concentrations when eculizumab is administered systemically, as observed in the COMPLETE trial where systemic dosing did not yield sufficient retinal drug exposure to impact GA progression (Halawa et al., 2021; Ong et al., 2024). Intravitreal injection has been proposed as a means to circumvent this limitation, yet such an approach is associated with its own risks, including ocular infection, inflammation, and the inherent burden of repeated intravitreal injections, particularly for a chronic, slowly progressive disease like dry AMD (Bandello et al., 2017; Hammadi et al., 2023).
Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge the multifactorial nature of dry AMD pathogenesis. While complement activation plays a substantial role, other factors such as oxidative stress, lipid dysregulation, and genetic predispositions (for instance, mutations in complement factor H) also contribute to disease progression (Dascalu et al., 2024; Holz et al., 2014). This implies that a monotherapy approach focused solely on C5 inhibition may not be sufficient to halt disease progression in all patients. There exists the possibility of redundancy within the complement system or compensatory activation of parallel inflammatory pathways that could undermine the therapeutic effect of eculizumab (Dascalu et al., 2024).
The economic aspect is another consideration. Eculizumab is among the most expensive biologics on the market. Its cost-effectiveness, particularly in a disease with a large patient population like dry AMD, is a substantive challenge that must be addressed if widespread adoption is to be achieved. High treatment costs combined with the need for repeated intravitreal dosing could create barriers both to patient compliance and to reimbursement by healthcare systems (Bandello et al., 2017).
From a broader strategic perspective, the clinical development of eculizumab for dry AMD may benefit from a combination therapy approach. Given the multifactorial etiology of dry AMD, pairing complement inhibition with agents that target oxidative stress or metabolic dysregulation could provide a synergistic effect that enhances overall efficacy. Such combination regimens may offer broader protection by simultaneously addressing multiple pathogenic pathways driving retinal degeneration (Dascalu et al., 2024; Holz et al., 2014).
On the other hand, the robust molecular rationale—that elevated complement C5a drives NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent RPE cell death—is one of the strongest arguments in favor of pursuing complement inhibition as a therapeutic strategy (Brandstetter, 2016). If intravitreal administration of eculizumab can be optimized to achieve and sustain therapeutic drug levels in the retinal tissue, then the blockade of terminal complement activation could feasibly reduce inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis and improve critical cellular functions such as autophagic clearance of POS and MerTK signaling (Armento et al., 2021; Ong et al., 2024). Early-phase clinical studies that incorporate biomarker endpoints, such as reduced levels of C5a, diminished MAC deposition, and lowered inflammasome activity in RPE cells, will be essential in confirming that the drug’s mechanisms are effectively engaged at the target site (Hammadi et al., 2023).
In summary, while systemic clinical trials of eculizumab in GA have not met efficacy endpoints, likely due to challenges with retinal drug delivery, the agent remains a promising candidate from a mechanistic standpoint. Its potent inhibition of C5 and the consequent reduction in both inflammatory mediators and cytolytic complexes directly targets processes implicated in RPE cell death and retinal degeneration in dry AMD. The established safety profile and clinical experience from its use in systemic disorders further strengthen the case for its repurposing, provided that delivery challenges can be addressed.
Looking ahead, the optimal development strategy for eculizumab in dry AMD may involve:
1. Development and validation of an intravitreal formulation that ensures sustained, therapeutic concentrations in the retina while minimizing the frequency of injections.
2. Incorporation of robust biomarker endpoints in early-phase clinical trials to verify that complement inhibition, specifically the blockade of C5a generation and MAC formation, is achieved in the retinal compartment (Hammadi et al., 2023).
3. Consideration of combination therapies that target additional pathogenic mechanisms in dry AMD, such as oxidative stress or dysregulated lipid metabolism, to provide a more comprehensive treatment approach (Dascalu et al., 2024; Holz et al., 2014).
4. Patient stratification based on genetic markers of complement dysregulation to identify subgroups that may derive the most benefit from complement inhibition.
Overall, eculizumab’s potential for repurposing in dry AMD is supported by a compelling molecular rationale and substantial preclinical evidence linking complement overactivation to RPE degeneration (Armento et al., 2021; Brandstetter, 2016). However, its clinical success in this indication will depend critically on overcoming the significant challenges posed by drug delivery to the retina and the multifaceted nature of dry AMD pathogenesis. Continued research in optimizing intravitreal formulations, refining dosing regimens, and potentially combining complement inhibition with other therapeutic modalities will be pivotal steps in determining whether eculizumab can be effectively repositioned as a treatment for this currently intractable ocular disorder (Halawa et al., 2021; Ong et al., 2024).
Given the current state of evidence, further investigation is warranted. Although systemic administration of eculizumab has not demonstrated efficacy in slowing GA progression, the promising mechanistic insights—specifically, its ability to reduce NLRP3 inflammasome priming and prevent MAC-mediated RPE injury—suggest that an intravitreal approach merits further exploration. Future clinical trials should be carefully designed to assess both anatomical and functional outcomes, while also evaluating patient-reported measures of visual function over extended follow-up periods. Such studies will be critical for establishing the therapeutic window, safety profile, and long-term efficacy of eculizumab in dry AMD.
In conclusion, the repurposing of eculizumab for dry AMD has strong potential from a mechanistic and biochemical standpoint. The data linking excessive complement activation, particularly elevated C5a levels, to RPE inflammasome activation and subsequent cell death provide a clear rationale for targeting C5. Nevertheless, clinical translation remains challenging primarily due to issues related to the blood-retina barrier and the inherent complexity of dry AMD pathogenesis. With advanced drug delivery strategies—most notably, the development of an intravitreal formulation—and the incorporation of combination treatment strategies that address other aspects of the disease, eculizumab could ultimately play a meaningful role in a multifaceted therapeutic regimen aimed at preserving retinal integrity and visual function in patients with dry AMD (Armento et al., 2021; Hammadi et al., 2023; Ong et al., 2024). Further detailed and methodologically rigorous clinical investigations will be essential to fully ascertain its clinical utility in this challenging indication (Halawa et al., 2021; Ong et al., 2024).

T0901317 (LXR agonist; Cayman Chemical Cat# 35320),"Proposal for T0901317 (LXR agonist; Cayman Chemical Cat# 35320)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
T0901317 is a synthetic, non‐steroidal small molecule designed as a potent agonist of liver X receptors (LXRs), particularly LXRα and LXRβ. Developed through advanced medicinal chemistry and high‐throughput screening approaches—often involving parallel array synthesis of tertiary amines—it represents one of the earliest and most widely used LXR agonists in preclinical research (Michael et al., 2005; Mitro et al., 2007). Structurally, T0901317 contains key functional groups, including electron‐withdrawing moieties that contribute to its nanomolar potency for receptor binding. As a member of the drug class of synthetic LXR agonists, it has served as a prototype compound for modulating transcriptional pathways of cholesterol metabolism, lipid homeostasis, and inflammatory signaling. Its discovery and development have provided significant insights into LXR biology, setting the stage for subsequent work on more selective modulators. Historically, T0901317 has established a benchmark for LXR activation in numerous biochemical assays due to its robust ability to elicit transcription of target genes such as ABCA1 and SREBP-1c (Lin & Gustafsson, 2015; Michael et al., 2005). Although its original therapeutic investigations have centered on metabolic and cardiovascular indications, its mechanism of action has generated interest in repurposing T0901317 for other disorders characterized by lipid dysregulation, including dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Therapeutic History:
Over the past two decades, T0901317 has been extensively employed as a chemical probe in preclinical studies to elucidate the roles of LXRs in cholesterol metabolism, inflammation, and tissue-specific lipogenesis (Michael et al., 2005; Mitro et al., 2007). Its ability to activate both LXR isoforms has led to seminal findings in the areas of atherosclerosis, diabetes, and even certain aspects of cancer biology (Lin, Vedin, & Steffensen, 2016; Loren et al., 2013). Despite promising preclinical efficacy—most notably the compound’s capacity to induce reverse cholesterol transport and modulate lipogenic gene expression—it has never progressed into clinical trials for metabolic diseases or retinal disorders (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In recent years, however, investigations have begun to explore its repurposing potential on a cellular level. In retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, for example, preliminary studies reported an upregulation of phagocytic receptors and an enhancement in the uptake of photoreceptor outer segments, suggesting that modulation of LXR pathways may address cellular clearance defects seen in dry AMD (Griffett & Burris, 2023; Lin & Gustafsson, 2015). While clinical use for dry AMD is still uncharted territory, existing literature on LXR agonist biology and T0901317’s pharmacological effects supports further exploration of local, targeted ocular delivery strategies to mitigate systemic side effects.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, T0901317 exerts its pharmacological activity by binding to the ligand-binding domain of LXRs, thereby promoting heterodimer formation with retinoid X receptor (RXR). This LXR/RXR heterodimer subsequently binds to specific DNA sequences known as LXR response elements (LXREs) in the promoters of target genes (Michael et al., 2005; Lin & Gustafsson, 2015). The binding of T0901317 stabilizes the active conformation of the receptor, leading to displacement of co-repressor complexes and recruitment of co-activator proteins such as members of the p160 family. The downstream consequence is the transcriptional upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol efflux (e.g., ABCA1, ABCG1), lipogenesis (e.g., SREBP-1c, FASN), and crucially for the proposed application in dry AMD, phagocytosis-related genes including MerTK (Lin, Vedin, & Steffensen, 2016; Loren et al., 2013). Specifically in retinal cells, the induction of MerTK and increased secretion of Gas6—a bridging molecule that enhances the opsonization of photoreceptor outer segments (POS)—are of significant interest. These biochemical interactions promote the αvβ5/MerTK-mediated phagocytosis mechanism that is essential for the clearance of POS in RPE cells. Experimental evidence in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE models has shown that treatment with T0901317 boosts MerTK mRNA and protein levels and increases POS uptake by over 40%, which is attributed to its direct transcriptional activation of key phagocytosis pathways (Griffett & Burris, 2023; Lin & Gustafsson, 2015). Nonetheless, it is important to note that T0901317 is known to also activate off-target nuclear receptors such as the pregnane X receptor (PXR) at higher concentrations, which has been documented to cause hepatic lipogenesis and hypertriglyceridemia in systemic applications (Mitro et al., 2007; Michael et al., 2005). For ocular indications, however, local delivery is proposed to minimize such side effects.

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing T0901317 in the context of dry AMD is that its activation of LXRs in RPE cells will restore lipid homeostasis and enhance phagocytic functions through upregulation of MerTK and Gas6. In the RPE, LXRs are known to regulate the transcription of genes that facilitate cholesterol efflux and maintain proper lipid metabolism (Lin & Gustafsson, 2015; Loren et al., 2013). By administering T0901317, it is expected that the upregulation of MerTK will occur, leading to improved clearance of POS, particularly under conditions of oxidative stress that are prevalent in dry AMD. This is supported by in vitro data showing that iPSC-derived RPE cells exhibit a significant increase in both MerTK expression and Gas6 secretion upon T0901317 treatment, translating into enhanced αvβ5/MerTK-mediated phagocytosis (Griffett & Burris, 2023). Additionally, the compound is anticipated to increase the expression of lipid transporters like ABCA1, further preserving lipid homeostasis in RPE cells (Michael et al., 2005; Lin & Gustafsson, 2015). This dual effect on both cholesterol efflux and phagocytic receptor expression underlines a mechanistic specificity that directly addresses the lipid accumulation and clearance defects associated with dry AMD. Given that oxidative stress is a critical factor in RPE dysfunction, the ability of T0901317 to sustain effective phagocytosis under such conditions could help in reducing the build-up of lipofuscin and drusen, hallmark features of the disease (Lin, Vedin, & Steffensen, 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, T0901317 emerges as a highly promising candidate for therapeutic repurposing in dry AMD based on a mechanistic rationale supported by extensive preclinical literature on LXR activation. The strengths of T0901317 include its well-characterized, potent agonistic activity against both LXRα and LXRβ and its robust upregulation of downstream targets such as MerTK, Gas6, and ABCA1 in cellular models. The established role of LXRs in modulating cholesterol metabolism, inflammatory responses, and phagocytosis underpins its potential to ameliorate the RPE clearance defects that contribute to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Lin & Gustafsson, 2015; Michael et al., 2005). Furthermore, preclinical evidence showing a greater than 40% increase in POS phagocytosis in iPSC-RPE cells supports the expected functional benefits in the context of maintaining retinal homeostasis (Griffett & Burris, 2023).

However, T0901317 presents notable challenges that must be carefully addressed. Its activation profile is not entirely selective for LXRs; known off-target effects include the activation of PXR, which has been associated with hepatic lipogenesis and significant systemic dyslipidemia (Mitro et al., 2007; Michael et al., 2005). These systemic side effects have historically limited its clinical application in metabolic disorders, necessitating strategies such as local ocular delivery to restrict its action to the retinal compartment while minimizing exposure to the liver and other tissues (Premaratne et al., 2024). Additionally, while the molecular efficacy in RPE cells is encouraging, potential issues related to long-term modulation of LXR signaling in retinal tissues remain unknown and require extensive evaluation in both animal models and early-phase clinical trials. Moreover, the complex interplay between LXR-induced lipogenesis and cholesterol efflux may yield unpredictable outcomes in the delicate microenvironment of the RPE if not finely balanced.

Overall, from a drug development perspective, T0901317 offers a strong mechanistic basis for repurposing in dry AMD, particularly given the clear link between lipid dysregulation and impaired phagocytosis in RPE cells. Its preclinical utility as a tool compound in elucidating LXR biology provides a solid foundation upon which further formulation and targeted delivery strategies can be built to overcome systemic toxicity. The strategy of local ocular application appears promising as it could allow for high local drug concentration with minimal systemic distribution, thereby mitigating adverse hepatic effects. However, further investigations into the pharmacokinetics, long-term safety, and precise dose-response relationships in ocular tissues are essential before progressing to clinical trials. In conclusion, while challenges remain, T0901317’s known potency, defined mechanism of action in upregulating phagocytic and lipid efflux pathways, and the availability of supporting preclinical data justifies its further evaluation as a therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration (Lin, Vedin, & Steffensen, 2016; Loren et al., 2013; Michael et al., 2005).

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of apocynin as a potential repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD).","Proposal for Apocynin

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of apocynin as a potential repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Apocynin is a small, naturally occurring phenolic compound that was originally isolated from plants such as Jatropha multifida and Picrorhiza kurroa. It belongs to the class of NADPH oxidase inhibitors and functions predominantly as an antioxidant by suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In its natural form, apocynin is a low molecular weight agent that, upon metabolic activation—often via myeloperoxidase (MPO)—forms a dimer (diapocynin) which is believed to block the assembly of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex (’t Hart et al., 2014). The compound has been synthesized and commercially made available (for example, Sigma-Aldrich catalog #A2156), and it is widely used in preclinical studies as a tool to reduce oxidative stress mediated via NADPH oxidase activity. Compounds in this class have been historically deployed in experimental settings to study and counteract oxidative stress in various systems, including the nervous system, the vasculature, and the retina (’t Hart et al., 2014).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, apocynin has been used predominantly in preclinical models that involve oxidative stress–related pathologies. For instance, in rodent models of diabetic complications such as diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy, apocynin has been shown to inhibit NADPH oxidase, resulting in reduced ROS production, attenuation of inflammatory signaling cascades, and improvement of vascular homeostasis (Asaba et al., 2005; Tawfik et al., 2009). In oxygen-induced retinopathy models—a condition that shares mechanistic similarities to the neovascular aspects of retinal disease—apocynin successfully reduced oxidative stress markers, such as lipid peroxidation and superoxide products, and normalized vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression (Al-Shabrawey et al., 2005). Although apocynin has been extensively evaluated in models of ischemic and diabetic retinopathies, its use in dry AMD has not been explored in clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical investigations in retinal degeneration models—such as those involving light-induced retinal injury in rodents—suggest that apocynin can mitigate photoreceptor loss and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy (Song et al., 2016). These studies build a rationale for repurposing apocynin in dry AMD given the shared contribution of oxidative stress to RPE dysfunction and photoreceptor degeneration (McCarty, 2017; Ruan et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, apocynin acts by targeting the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex—a major source of superoxide and subsequent ROS production in various cell types, including retinal cells. NADPH oxidase is composed of several subunits, including membrane-bound components (such as gp91^phox and p22^phox) as well as cytosolic components (p40^phox, p47^phox, and p67^phox). The activation of NADPH oxidase typically requires the translocation and assembly of these subunits at the cell membrane. Apocynin is thought to interfere with this assembly process, thus preventing the formation of the active enzyme complex (’t Hart et al., 2014). By inhibiting NADPH oxidase, apocynin effectively decreases the generation of ROS. In the RPE, this is significant because excessive ROS leads to lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes and damages lysosomal enzymes critical for the phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) (McCarty, 2017; Ruan et al., 2020). Oxidative stress has been documented to impair the activity of cathepsin D, a key lysosomal enzyme responsible for degrading POS components, leading to the accumulation of toxic intracellular debris such as lipofuscin. This lysosomal dysfunction contributes to the degenerative changes observed in dry AMD (McCarty, 2017; Song et al., 2016). Additionally, apocynin has been shown in cellular models (e.g., using ARPE-19 cells) to reduce ROS by approximately 62% at a concentration of 100 μM, preserve cathepsin D activity, and improve degradation of FITC-labeled POS by 28% (Ruan et al., 2020; Song et al., 2016). In rodent models of light-induced retinal degeneration, apocynin treatment correlated with a reduction in RPE atrophy and preservation of key phagocytic markers (McCarty, 2017; Ruan et al., 2020). Thus, the molecular interactions center on the prevention of excessive NADPH oxidase activation, reduction in ROS burden, and subsequent protection of the lysosomal machinery responsible for POS clearance.

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry AMD, the expected therapeutic effect of apocynin is to restore the oxidative balance within RPE cells and thereby improve lysosomal function. Specifically, by inhibiting NADPH oxidase, apocynin is hypothesized to reduce the accumulation of ROS that otherwise inactivate lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin D. Preservation of cathepsin D activity is critical for the degradation and clearance of POS components—a process that is impaired in dry AMD due to the buildup of oxidized lipids and protein aggregates (McCarty, 2017; Ruan et al., 2020). In ARPE-19 cell assays, treatment with apocynin at 100 μM has been reported to lower ROS levels by 62% and improve the degradation of fluorescently labeled POS by 28%, which is indicative of enhanced phagocytic clearance (Appukuttan et al., 2018; Song et al., 2016). Furthermore, in rat models subjected to light-induced retinal injury, apocynin administration resulted in reduced RPE atrophy and maintenance of photoreceptor integrity, suggesting that improved lysosomal function may translate to a delay or attenuation of retinal degeneration (Song et al., 2016; Ruan et al., 2020). The biochemical premise is that by preserving lysosomal enzyme activity and thereby enhancing the degradation of accumulated photoreceptor debris, apocynin could help maintain the physiological clearance mechanisms in the retina that are vital for preventing the formation of drusen and subsequent RPE cell death (McCarty, 2017; Song et al., 2016). Given that NADPH oxidase types such as NOX2 are expressed in RPE cells—and their dysregulation has been implicated in the loss of phagocytic efficiency and the induction of complement-mediated inflammatory cascades—the targeted inhibition by apocynin is expected to work directly at the level of oxidative stress generation. This mechanistic action should theoretically lead to improved retinal pigment epithelial cell homeostasis and photoreceptor survival, which are critical end-points in the treatment of dry AMD.

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of apocynin as a potential candidate for treating dry AMD is cautiously optimistic based on the mechanistic rationale and supportive preclinical data from related retinal oxidative stress models. One notable strength of this candidate is its clearly defined mechanism of action: by targeting NADPH oxidase, apocynin directly reduces ROS generation—a central pathologic process in dry AMD. The compound’s ability to preserve lysosomal enzyme activity and promote clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (as demonstrated in ARPE-19 cellular assays and rat models) directly addresses key pathological features of dry AMD, namely lysosomal dysfunction and the subsequent accumulation of toxic debris in RPE cells (Ruan et al., 2020; Song et al., 2016). Furthermore, its preclinical efficacy in related models of retinal degeneration and oxidative stress—in diabetic retinopathy, oxygen-induced retinopathy, and light-induced retinal degeneration—strengthens the argument for its repurposing in dry AMD (Tawfik et al., 2009; Al-Shabrawey et al., 2005).

However, there are also weaknesses and gaps in the current body of evidence. Firstly, despite promising preclinical data, there is a notable absence of direct clinical trial evidence or clinical data assessing apocynin’s effects specifically in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This lack of human data necessitates cautious interpretation of the preclinical findings. Secondly, while the in vitro and animal model data suggest improvements in lysosomal enzyme activity and POS clearance, the precise quantitative impact on vision-related endpoints and long-term retinal integrity in dry AMD models remains to be fully elucidated (McCarty, 2017; Ruan et al., 2020). Another potential concern is the specificity of apocynin; while it is widely used as an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, some studies have raised questions about its specific mode of action and whether its beneficial effects might also be attributed to nonspecific antioxidant effects (Song et al., 2016). This ambiguity could complicate efforts to optimize dosing and target engagement in the context of dry AMD. Additionally, concerns regarding bioavailability, tissue penetration in the retina, and potential off-target effects that may arise from systemic administration should also be addressed in subsequent preclinical studies (’t Hart et al., 2014).

In summary, apocynin presents a mechanistically sound and promising candidate for dry AMD based on its ability to inhibit NADPH oxidase, reduce ROS generation, preserve lysosomal enzyme activity in RPE cells, and thus improve the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments—a crucial process compromised in the progression of dry AMD (Ruan et al., 2020; Song et al., 2016). The strengths of this therapeutic candidate lie in its clear molecular target, supportive preclinical evidence, and capacity to counteract key pathological features of dry AMD (Ruan et al., 2020; Song et al., 2016). However, weaknesses include the current lack of direct clinical data, unresolved questions regarding specificity and mechanism nuances, and potential issues related to drug delivery to the retina. Further targeted preclinical studies focusing on dry AMD models and subsequent clinical evaluations would be necessary to confirm apocynin’s efficacy and safety profile in the setting of AMD. Overall, the compound remains a viable candidate for repurposing, warranting additional investigation given the critical unmet need in dry AMD therapeutics (McCarty, 2017; Marchesi et al., 2024; Ruan et al., 2020).

Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me),"Proposal for Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Bardoxolone methyl (also known as CDDO-Me) is a synthetic triterpenoid derivative originally developed via chemical modification of oleanolic acid to enhance its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties (Handa, 2012). It belongs to the class of synthetic triterpenoids, a group that has been widely investigated for their ability to modulate redox-sensitive signaling pathways, particularly by activating the NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2) transcription factor (Morilla, Ghosal, & Romero, 2023). This compound is recognizable by its electrophilic centers, which enable covalent modification of specific cysteine residues on target proteins such as KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1), ultimately leading to the activation of NRF2 (Handa, 2012). In general, this class of compounds has been used in various systemic indications including chronic kidney disease and certain cancers, leveraging their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Bardoxolone methyl has an extensive preclinical and clinical record in diseases characterized by heightened oxidative stress and inflammation, as evidenced by its evaluation in phase II and phase III trials for conditions such as type 2 diabetic kidney disease (Handa, 2012). Although its primary use has been focused on systemic disorders, there is currently no registered clinical trial in major registries such as ClinicalTrials.gov evaluating bardoxolone methyl specifically for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) or related retinal conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, there exists emerging preclinical evidence that supports its potential utility in ocular contexts; for instance, studies in rodent models have demonstrated that NRF2 activation can lead to reduced Bruch’s membrane thickening, a hallmark of early AMD pathology, as well as preservation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) morphology under oxidative stress conditions (Handa, 2012). Additionally, the robust safety and pharmacokinetic profile established for bardoxolone methyl in non-ocular indications offers a significant advantage when considering drug repurposing for dry AMD (Basyal, Lee, & Kim, 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
Bardoxolone methyl functions primarily by covalently modifying critical cysteine residues on the KEAP1 protein via Michael addition reactions, thereby disrupting the KEAP1-NRF2 complex and preventing the proteasomal degradation of NRF2 (Handa, 2012). This disruption allows NRF2 to accumulate and translocate into the nucleus, where it binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of genes encoding several phase II detoxification enzymes and antioxidant proteins such as superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and glutamate–cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM) (Handa, 2012). These enzymes are fundamental for maintaining redox homeostasis, as they catalyze the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and support glutathione synthesis, which is essential for cellular antioxidant capacity (Basyal, Lee, & Kim, 2024). In the context of the retinal pigment epithelium, where oxidative stress can disrupt lysosomal pH and inhibit phagocytosis, the upregulation of these antioxidant enzymes is hypothesized to restore lysosomal integrity and improve the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) (Handa, 2012). The mechanistic rationale is that by reducing oxidative damage through enhanced antioxidant defense, bardoxolone methyl may counteract the cascade of events leading to lysosomal impairment and RPE dysfunction observed in dry AMD (Abokyi, 2021).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis posits that bardoxolone methyl will induce the expression of ARE–driven phase II detoxification enzymes in RPE cells, thereby mitigating oxidative stress that impairs lysosomal function and phagocytosis, a critical process for maintaining retinal homeostasis (Basyal, Lee, & Kim, 2024). In vitro studies have shown that treatment of primary human RPE monolayers subjected to photo-oxidative stress results in a restoration of lysosomal pH and an approximately 40% increase in the degradation of photoreceptor outer segments, indicative of improved phagocytic function (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The expected molecular effect is mediated by bardoxolone methyl’s activation of NRF2, which elevates mRNA and protein levels of antioxidant enzymes, protecting the RPE from oxidative insults and facilitating the clearance of accumulated metabolic debris (Handa, 2012). Such responses are particularly relevant given that RPE cells express high levels of NRF2-regulated genes under oxidative challenge, and their proper functioning is crucial for preventing the progression of dry AMD (Abokyi, 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Bardoxolone methyl presents itself as a therapeutically promising candidate for dry AMD based on a well-validated molecular target and a compelling pharmacologic rationale; its potent activation of the NRF2 pathway offers a direct means to counteract the oxidative stress that underpins much of AMD pathology (Handa, 2012). One of the main strengths of this therapeutic candidate lies in its extensive clinical history in systemic diseases, where favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles have been extensively characterized, suggesting a strong translational potential (Basyal, Lee, & Kim, 2024). Moreover, the mechanistic specificity – namely the covalent modification of KEAP1 leading to upregulation of key cytoprotective enzymes (SOD2, HO-1, GCLM) – directly addresses the biochemical deficits observed in the RPE during dry AMD, particularly the impaired lysosomal function and defective clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (Handa, 2012). However, the major weakness is the absence of direct clinical evidence or extensive preclinical data specifically in ocular models or dry AMD contexts, as current clinical trial registries do not yet document studies exploring its use in retinal degenerative conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while systemic administration has been well tolerated in other indications, the translation of systemic dosing to achieve efficacious concentrations in the retina may present challenges, including issues related to retinal penetration, potential off-target effects, and the differential physiology of ocular tissues compared to systemic targets (Morilla, Ghosal, & Romero, 2023). In summary, while bardoxolone methyl shows significant mechanistic promise for treating dry AMD by restoring antioxidant capacity and improving the phagocytic function of RPE cells, further focused preclinical ophthalmic studies are warranted to validate its efficacy in retinal models and to optimize dosing strategies that ensure adequate ocular bioavailability (Abokyi, 2021). The overall evaluation supports continued investigation into bardoxolone methyl as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD, with the potential to address an unmet medical need if subsequent in vivo studies and eventual clinical trials confirm its beneficial effects in the retina (Basyal, Lee, & Kim, 2024).

β-Lapachone (NQO1 substrate; Santa Cruz Cat# sc-204290),"Proposal for β-Lapachone (NQO1 substrate; Santa Cruz Cat# sc-204290)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
β‐Lapachone is a naturally derived naphthoquinone originally isolated from the bark of the lapacho tree (Tabebuia species), making it a natural product rather than a purely synthetic chemical. It belongs to the quinone class of therapeutic compounds, a group known for their reversible redox properties and ability to undergo bioactivation by enzymes such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). Quinones have been widely explored for their anticancer, anti‐inflammatory, and cytoprotective activities in diverse biomedical contexts, and β‐lapachone specifically is recognized for its anticancer prodrug properties. Its identification and subsequent development have relied on its unique chemical structure—which allows a two‐electron reduction by NQO1, initiating a futile redox cycle—and its capacity to alter intracellular NAD^+/NADH balance, a mechanism that underlies its potential therapeutic uses (Park et al., 2014; Feng, 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, β‐lapachone has been investigated primarily in the context of oncology as an anticancer agent due to its selective cytotoxicity in NQO1‐overexpressing tumor cells. Preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy by promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and subsequent cell death in cancer models, exploiting the high levels of NQO1 found in certain tumors (Hayes, 2021). Beyond oncology, β‐lapachone’s pharmacological profile extends to its potential utility as an anti‐angiogenic agent, as evidenced by studies in oxygen‐induced retinopathy models where it was shown to inhibit pathological retinal neovascularization via regulation of hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1α (HIF‐1α) (Park et al., 2014). Although its use in dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) has not been established in clinical or veterinary settings to date, the biological underpinnings of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction in dry AMD share common features with the pathological processes modulated by β‐lapachone, including impaired redox balance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and defective autophagy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, the quinone class—exemplified by compounds such as idebenone—has been used both preclinically and in certain clinical scenarios for retinal and neurodegenerative conditions, supporting the rationale for repurposing β‐lapachone for dry AMD (Feng, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanistic basis for β‐lapachone’s proposed therapeutic effect relies on its bioactivation via the enzyme NQO1, which is highly expressed in various tissues including the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Upon reduction by NQO1, β‐lapachone participates in a redox cycle that consumes NADH or NADPH and rapidly regenerates NAD^+. This regeneration elevates the intracellular NAD^+/NADH ratio, a critical determinant for the activation of NAD^+-dependent enzymes such as sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). SIRT1, once activated, engages downstream signaling pathways such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which serves as an energy sensor and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and lipid metabolism (Hayes, 2021; Feng, 2021). These pathways, in turn, stimulate autophagy—a catabolic process essential for clearing damaged proteins and organelles, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. In RPE cells, enhanced autophagic flux may lead to improved lysosomal function and a reduction in lipofuscin accumulation, which is a hallmark of dry AMD. Beyond autophagy, the restoration of mitochondrial function via improved NAD^+ levels can help maintain energy homeostasis in metabolically active RPE cells. An additional proposed effect, albeit more indirect, is the stimulation of MerTK-driven phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS). MerTK is a receptor tyrosine kinase critical for the clearance of POS, and its proper function is essential for RPE integrity and retinal homeostasis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Thus, by engaging NQO1, β‐lapachone can potentially restore redox balance, activate SIRT1/AMPK signaling, and promote a cascade of cellular repair mechanisms that include improved autophagy and phagocytosis—mechanisms that are fundamentally impaired in dry AMD (Park et al., 2014; Feng, 2021).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry age‐related macular degeneration, the therapeutic hypothesis is that β‐lapachone’s activation of NQO1 in RPE cells will boost NAD^+ regeneration and thereby enhance the activity of NAD^+-dependent deacetylases such as SIRT1. The activation of the SIRT1/AMPK axis is expected to lead to improved mitochondrial function and increased autophagic flux, which in turn would facilitate the clearance of damaged proteins and organelles, reducing the accumulation of lipofuscin. Lipofuscin buildup is a characteristic feature of dry AMD and is associated with impaired lysosomal degradation and cellular senescence in RPE cells. Additionally, by restoring cellular energy metabolism and redox balance, β‐lapachone may secondarily promote MerTK‐driven phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments, a process critical to maintaining retinal health and function. The expression of NQO1 in retinal and RPE cells further supports the potential of this approach, as these cells rely on efficient mitochondrial and lysosomal function to prevent degeneration (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Feng, 2021). Moreover, the literature indicates that some preclinical studies have explored oral and topical formulations of β‐lapachone to achieve sufficient ocular tissue levels, bolstering its candidacy as a drug repurposing candidate for ocular applications (Park et al., 2014; Tsang et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of β‐lapachone as a therapeutic candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration reveals several strengths, as well as challenges that warrant further investigation. One of the primary strengths lies in its mechanism of action; by targeting NQO1, β‐lapachone can induce a redox cycle that not only regenerates NAD^+ but also activates protective signaling pathways including SIRT1 and AMPK. These pathways are critical for the maintenance of mitochondrial and lysosomal function and have been implicated in the cellular pathology underlying dry AMD. The ability to improve autophagic flux carries significant promise, as defective autophagy is central to RPE dysfunction and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration in dry AMD (Feng, 2021; Hayes, 2021).

Another strength is the precedent within the quinone class for applications in diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, particularly in the retina. Compounds such as idebenone, which is structurally related to β‐lapachone, have already found use in some retinal and neurodegenerative conditions, suggesting that repurposing a quinone-based compound like β‐lapachone is a viable strategy (Feng, 2021).

However, there are notable weaknesses and uncertainties. Despite promising preclinical data in models of pathological retinal neovascularization, there is a paucity of direct evidence regarding β‐lapachone’s efficacy in treating dry AMD specifically. Most studies to date have focused on its anticancer and anti‐angiogenic effects rather than on RPE survival or autophagic restoration in the context of AMD (Park et al., 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, although the hypothesis regarding enhanced MerTK‐driven phagocytosis is intriguing, detailed mechanistic studies confirming this effect in RPE models are currently lacking.

Another challenge is the delivery and pharmacokinetic profile. While there are reports of both oral and topical formulations achieving therapeutic ocular levels, the effective concentration required for modulating NQO1 activity in RPE cells without causing off‐target effects or toxicity remains to be rigorously defined. Quinones, due to their redox activity, have the potential to generate ROS under specific conditions, which could be deleterious if not properly controlled; therefore, a fine balance must be achieved between beneficial NAD^+ regeneration and harmful oxidative stress (Hayes, 2021; Feng, 2021).

In summary, β‐lapachone represents a promising candidate for repurposing in dry age‐related macular degeneration owing to its unique mechanism of NQO1-mediated redox cycling, NAD^+ regeneration, and subsequent activation of cytoprotective pathways such as SIRT1/AMPK, which are critical for maintaining RPE cellular integrity and function. Its ability to potentially enhance autophagic flux and stimulate MerTK-driven phagocytosis further strengthens its candidacy. Nonetheless, the lack of direct evidence in dry AMD models, coupled with uncertainties regarding optimal dosing and potential oxidative risks, suggests that additional detailed preclinical studies are necessary. These studies should aim to elucidate the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of β‐lapachone in ocular tissues, confirm its effects on autophagy and phagocytosis in RPE cells, and establish a clear safety profile before progressing to clinical trials in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Park et al., 2014; Feng, 2021).
